To show that such commentaries are at least possible is one of my major goals. What Is This Book All About? This book must be seen for what it is: an attempt to clear the deck of an intellectual mistake that stretches back to the early Church’s philosophical defenders of the faith. That disastrous mis- take was to regard Stoic natural law theory as the equivalent of bibli- cal law. I do not deal in detail with the early Church fathers in this book, however. I deal with more recent variations of this ancient er- ror. Christians have made a similar compromise with Newtonian natural law for slightly over three centuries. Isaac Newton rather than Plato or Aristotle is the intellectual force to be reckoned with to- day, or at least he has been until quite recently. The rise of quantum physics in the 1920’s and then, in the 1980’s, chaos theory, in princi- ple overthrew the Newtonian synthesis, but no clear alternative, so- cially or theoretically, has been put in its place. On this point, see 1s the World Running Down?, mentioned previously. This book should not be regarded as presenting the case for bibli- cal theocracy, although I certainly believe in biblical theocracy. R. J. Rushdoony’s htitute~ of Biblical Law (Craig Press, 1973) and Greg L. Bahnsen’s By This Standard (Institute for Christian Economics, 1985) do that adequately. Nor does this book try to spell out the details of what such a biblical theocracy might look like. Many specifics are found in TOOIJ of Dominion. What I do in this book is to present the case, as clearly as I can, yet with all the details necessary to prove my case, that the proposed Chri.rtian alternatives to biblical theocracy that have been suggested by major twentieth-century Christian com- mentators do not stand up to the rigorous test of Scripture. These schemes are faithful neither to the Bible nor to the ethical and legal standards of modern humanism. Thus, I classify them as way sta- tions, either for converts to Christianity who are coming into the faith or for neo-evangelical liberals on their way out. These pluralist alternatives are halfway houses for the intellectually wounded. They are halfway covenant systems. This book shows what in principle cannot work for Christianity, either philosophically and socially, and it shows what did not work in the American colonial period. Other Christian historians have blamed the excessive biblicism of our colonial forefathers for the failures of the early experiments in Christian political order (see Chapter 5).

There is a predictable progression in the deterioration of an es- tablished biblical culture. It begins with the abandonment of the concept of revealed biblical law. The implications of this moral and judicial defection spread rapidly (perhaps even simultaneously) to biblical philosophy. Then these errors move outward from the indi- vidual moral will and mind to social institutions: ecclesiastical, fa- milial, and political. In short, compromises are made in certain areas of thought and life at an earlier stage that steadily work their way into all the other areas. Christians negotiate away their inherit- ance on a piecemeal basis, generation by generation, always protest- ing that what they are doing is in fact a consistent outworking of “Christian principles.” This book is not an attempt to refute every modern Christian thinker who has compromised with the humanist enemy. If it were, I would face the writing problem described by the Apostle John: “And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen” (John 21:25). I refer in the text and footnotes to many authors, but only be- cause I am targeting their ideas. Only in the chapters in Part 2 do I single out a few key thinkers as sufficiently important to warrant a whole chapter, and in Appendix B. I begin with a pair of premises: 1) there is no religious neutrality; 2) there are no political vacuums.

Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him (Ps. 2:9-12). We cannot help but see, then, how far the infallible moral in- struction of this psalm is removed from the pluralist political theories of our day. By contending that civil policy should not be based upon or favor any one distinctive religion or philosophy of life (but rather balance the alleged rights of all conflicting viewpoints), pluralism ul- timately takes its political stand with secularism in refusing to “kiss the Son” and “serve Jehovah with fear.” The pluralist approach tran- gresses the first commandment by countenancing and deferring to different ultimate authorities (gods) in the area of public policy. In- stead of exclusively submitting to Jehovah’s law with fear and openly following God’s enthroned Son, the pluralist attempts the impossible task of honoring more than one master in civil legislation (Matt. 6:24) – a kind of “political polytheism.” Greg L.

The historical question is: Which side, if either, will progres- sively become victorious in world civilization? For almost eighteen centuries, Christians have disagreed on the answer to this crucial question. There is a related question: What will be the visible marks of the victorious civilization’s triumph over the loser’s civilization? If Chris- tianity y wins, how will people know? If anti-Christianity wins, how will people know? One obvious answer is: by the civil legal order gov - an.ing the nations. 1 This answer is deeply resisted by the vast majority of Christians today, but it was a major foundation of world evangel- ism in the Old Covenant — an evangelism program that the Israelites failed to pursue. The righteousness of biblical law was designed by God to put the pagan world under conviction.

This program of world evangelism re- quired the Israelites to obey God’s civil laws both at home and abroad. Their failure to obey at home led to their failure to bring the message of spiritual deliverance to the world. Instead, they were repeatedly delivered by God into the world, as foreign invaders cap- tured the reigns of power inside the nation, or else captured the peo- ple and sent them into slavery abroad. It is my contention that the failure of worldwide Christian evan- gelism today is to a large degree the result of a similar failure of God’s people to proclaim and pursue covenantal civil standards for their own societies. There are at least seven hundred different plans for converting the world to Christ now in operation. 2 Not one of them seems to be working well enough to offer much hope that the whole world will be converted in time to save the souls of some five billion non-Christian people who are already alive. What is the problem?’ Here is one major problem: if the whole world were to convert tomorrow to faith in Jesus Christ, American Christians (where the major centers of evangelism are located in the twentieth century) would be unable to answer the inevitable ques- tion: What should we do, now that we believe in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord?” Americans have offered no explicitly biblical cov- enantal civil model to the world. So, God withholds His Spirit. He has suffered enough embarrassment on this score already. He waits. He waits for American Christians to abandon their present mixed theology: the theology of religious pluralism.

It controls almost every visible institution. 3 Wherever humanism’s monopoly increases, it becomes ever- more vicious. The slaughter of a few thousand unarmed Chinese students by the military in June of 1989 was only a comparatively mild-mannered manifestation of Communism’s long-term tactics of terrorizing civilian populations. What was different about this mass execution was the presence of satellite television, which made visible to hundreds of millions of Westerners something that had been going on quietly and systematically in Communist societies since 1917. What the world saw take place in Tiananmen square is humanism unchained from the restraint of Christianity. Nevertheless, for about eighteen centuries, Christian philosophers and social theorists have tried to smooth over the inherent religious differences between covenant-breakers and covenant-keepers. C-hris- tian intellectual leaders have repeatedly adopted the philosophical systems of their mortal enemies in the name of a “higher synthesis,” a supposedly creative common ground between light and darkness. Even those scholars who recognize clearly that Christianity and human- ism are rival creeds based on radically different views of God, man, law, and time, still cling to the temporarily convenient fiction that there can be a permanent political cease-fire between the two systems. Following Rushdoony’s lead, I call this “intellectual schizophrenia.” Gary Scott Smith We can see this operational intellectual schizophrenia quite clearly in the writings of Christian historian Gary Scott Smith, who calls himself a principled pluralist. He has pointed to the earlier in- tellectual schizophrenia of American colonial social theorists. First, he admits that most of the colonists were Christians, and Reformed, Calvinistic Christians at that: Reformed theology was carried to the shores of America by English Puritans in the 1620s. From the founding of Plymouth to the American Revolution, about 80 percent of the colonists were adherents of Reformed 3. Only the Islamic Middle East is exempted. Here, a much older enemy of Christianity rules, and in much of the Middle East, humanism has made major in- roads. The absence of veils on Muslim women is the most visible manifestation of this change. Not even the Ayatollah Khomeini could get young Iranian women to put on veils. There are limits to every tyranny. A change in women’s fashions, once established, will always mark the limits of any tyranny."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xvi POLITICAL POLYTHEISM theology who belonged to various denominations: Presbyterian, Congrega- tionalist, Baptist, Dutch Reformed, German Reformed, and other smaller Calvinistic communions.4 Second, he correctly observes that ‘the new American nation, as it emerged in the late eighteenth century, was built upon an eclectic foundation.”5 He identifies three cultural streams in this eclectic political river: radical Whiggism, Enlightenment thought (several European traditions), and “the Judeo-Christian tradition.” (His summary rests on the implied distinction between radical Whiggism and the Enlightenment — a false distinction — and the implied con- nection between the ethics of Judaism and Christianity — a false con- nection. 7 ) Third, he observes: “During the Revolutionary era Christians failed to develop a distinctly biblical understanding of political thought that differed sharply with Enlightenment rationalism.”s If he is speaking of Scottish Enlightenment thought – the right wing of the European Enlightenment — which I presume that he is, then he is correct. Fourth, he acknowledges the inherent incompatibility of the two systems: “Christian and Enlightenment world views, though resting upon very different presuppositions, combined to furnish principles that guided the development of the American political system. . . . American society has continued to blend or amalgamate Judeo- Christian and Enlightenment principles to the present day, and this ideological synthesis still molds our political consciousness and con- terns.” g Note his phrase, “ideological synthesis.” What is remarkable – no, what is utterly astonishing– is his con- tinuing commitment to the operational validity and moral integrity of this “ideological synthesis.” We have no choice in the matter, he 4.

Neither general principles nor specific New Testament laws teach that Christ expects nations to be formally committed to Him. The New Testa- ment does not even imply that God will work in special ways through indi- vidual nations, as He did through Old Testament Israel. Instead, the gos- pels and the epistles emphasize that God’s primary agent in the world is the church, which consists of individuals drawn from many nations. The lim- ited New Testament statements about political life suggest that nations will not be distinctively Christian and that they will contain mixed populations of believers and unbelievers (see Matt. 13:24-30).10 He is a master of verbal legerdemain. “Keep your eye on the pea under the shell,” he calls to his intended victims. “Neither general principles nor specific New Testament laws teach that Christ expects nations to be formally committed to Him.” He is assuming what he first needs to prove. I challenge him to prove that the Old Testament civil requirements were necessarily overthrown by the New Testa- ment. He should not simply ammze that the God who wrote the Old Testament changed His mind when He wrote the New Testament. He needs to prove it first. He needs to show us why the Old Testa- ment is little more than a discarded first draft when it comes to the stipulations of the civil covenant, yet still judicially binding on indi- viduals, churches, and families. (Or does he think that bestiality — also not mentioned in the New Testament — is now judicially beyond biblically specified sanctions, since it is only Old Testament civil law that prohibited it?) He says that “Go&s primary agent in the world is the church.” Quite true. Now, what are God’s secondary agencies? Dead silence. How about the civil government as an explicitly and uniquely Chris- tian institution testifying to the unique nature of Jesus’ kingdom? Never! “The Bible does not command governments forthrightly to express commitment to Christianity or to develop a covenantal rela- tionship with Christ.”’1 Really? This seems to be what he ought to prove, not assert. In any case, at least we may legitimately ask: “Does the Bible expressly @/zi&t an explicitly Christian covenantal relationship?” The political pluralists write as though it does; it clearly 10. Smith, “The Principled Pluralist Response to National Confession,” zW., p. 214. 11. Ibid., p. 215."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":". . . Xvlll POLITICAL POLYTHEISM does not. The fact is, political Pluralists write as though thg would ratbr live under Communist tyranny than under an explicit~ biblical theocracy. God may grant them their wish, and the rest of us, too. Dr. Smith has a fixation on the word prima~. “Christ’s authority and kingdom in this age, as described in the New Testament, are primarily spiritual, not physical or territorial.”lz When he says “pri- marily,” he means exclu.sive~. Here is the ethical and judicial dualism of both fundamentalism and traditional mysticism: the separation of whatever is spiritual from that which is historical. And the same im- pulse undergirds Dr. Smith’s position: antinomianism. He wants the State to be able to avoid the authority of God’s revealed law and espe- cially its historical sanctions. This leaves the politicians and bureaucrats without the fear of God or specific guidance from Him in His law. He says that “nations will not be distinctively Christian and that they will contain mixed populations of believers and unbelievers.” Israel also contained mixed populations of believers and unbelievers — strangers within the gate. The strangers did not serve as judges, but they enjoyed full civil liberties. 13 Why should any New Testa- ment covenanted nation be different? Dead silence. Why such continued dead silence? Dead intellectual position, bibli- cally speaking. No Cultural Escalation of the Confrontation He implicitly assumes, as do all pluralists, that there is no histor- ical progress in the war between Christ and anti-Christ in the New Covenant era, no cultural extension over time by both sides of their rival religious presuppositions. What political pluralists categorically deny in everything they write is the truth of the observation made by C. S. Lewis in 1946: “If you dip into any college, or school, or parish, or family — anything you like — at a given point in its history, you always find that there was a time before that point when there was more elbow room and contrasts weren’t quite so sharp; and that there’s going to be a time after that point when there is even less room for indecision and choices are even more momentous. Good is always getting better and bad is always getting worse: the possibili- ties of even apparent neutrality are always diminishing. The whole thing is sorting itself out all the time, coming to a point, getting 12. Ibid. , p. 214. 13. Chapter 2, below."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Preface xix sharper and harder.” 14 Pluralists want to defer until the final judgment the appearance of that dangerously sharp point of history. They want it to end his- tory. They do not want to face the inescapable historical decision of all confrontational politics: stick or be stuck. It is God’s law or chaos, light or darkness, God or Satan – manifested progressively as time passes. They do whatever they can to deny this. Pluralists spend their lives trying to file down that inescapably sharp historical point. Their files are made of high quality stainless steel, but the point is made of diamond. A Parting of the Ways What we find in the final decades of the second millennium after the birth of Jesus Christ is a growing realization on both sides of the political cease-fire line that the traditional ideological synthesis of political pluralism is collapsing. What we are witnessing is a slow but sure breakdown of the political cease-fire between humanism and Christianity. On each side, the defenders of the compromise sys- tem can no longer hold their own troops in line. Guerilla skirmishes are breaking out continually. The humanists are beginning to act like humanists, and a tiny handful of Christians are beginning to act like Christians. The confrontation over the life-and-death issue of abortion is one obvious example of this irrepressible conflict. On the abortionist’s table, there is no neutral position between life and death. This is why the inescapably political debate over abortion is so frustrating for those who want to steer a middle course. There is no middle course, There is no neutralijv. The politician’s left foot is being held to the fire by the pro-death forces, and his right foot is being shoved in the coals by the-pro-life forces. He has only one choice: accept the political fact of either one burned foot or two. He, like the political pluralist, deeply resents being forced to make this choice. He wants no burned feet: He longs for ~he simpler, cooler world of yesterday, when the common morality was implicitly Christian and officially neutral. He is not going to get that world; it is gone forever. So are at least 25 million dead babies, all executed legally in the United States. Another example is Christian education.

This aided the cause of the more consist- ent Christians, who could then plausibly begin to call for the banish- ment of all public schools. For those in the middle — defenders of public education and defenders of government subsidies to private education — the skies grew dark. With the government subsidy comes the iron fist. There are no free lunches, not even school lunches. There is no neutrali~. It is one ofthose historical ironies that Gary Scott Smith should be a professor at the most famous non-cooperating college in Amer- ica, Grove City College, whose refusal to take federal money led to its resistance to the imposition of federal educational regulations. The government then sued the college. The case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that unless Congress passed a law that specifically brought Grove City College under its regula- tions, the school was free to resist such controls. Congress immedi- ately passed such a law over the President’s veto, announcing pub- licly that even the indirect acceptance of federal funds through loans granted to students constitutes the “open door policy” to all govern- ment regulations over education. Nevertheless, Professor Scott con- tinues to defend the legitimacy of the eighteenth-century “ideological synthesis.” So does his Grove City colleague, historian L. John Van Til. 15 So deeply entrenched is the ideology of political pluralism that most of its Christian victims cannot perceive what is happening to them. The brainwashing by the humanists of the intellectual leaders of conservative Protestantism has been remarkably successful.

It argues that Christian defenders of political pluralism are now trapped by the necessary and inescapable impli- cations of their own compromise. They have bet their futures (and yours) on the preservation of the political cease-fire between Christi- anity and anti-Christianity. But as Christians steadily retreated from this covenantal conflict, 1673 to 1973, turning in their weapons (e.g., Christian education) to a supposedly “neutral” police force, their covenant-breaking enemies have systematically taken over that po- lice force. This cease-fire is beginning to resemble the cease-fire of the firing squad. It can end with one word: “Fire !“ 15.

The question is: Who will do the firing? More to the point: Whose law will govern the civil court that issues the sentence? Will the standard of justice be God’s law or man’s? ‘G It is this question which the political pluralists dare not ask in public. To ask this question publicly is to encourage Christians to seek exclusively biblical answers. Pluralists do not want Christians to seek exclusively biblical answers. Biblical exclusiveness is a denial of the religion of pluralism. The Dilemma of Christian Pluralism The synthesis of political pluralism is not breaking down only be- cause of the inherent contradictions between the religion of man and the religion of the Bible. It is also breaking down because the reli- gion of secular humanism is itself collapsing, not only theoretically but institutionally. For about eighteen centuries, the foundation of the West’s ideo- logical synthesis was men’s naive faith in the existence of natural rights and natural law principles, discoverable by unaided human reason, or at least by “right reason.” This intellectual construct was the invention of later Hellenistic philosophers who were trapped by the collapse of the Greek Poks and its religious and philosophical underpinnings. They saw that the collapse of the Polis and the simul- taneous rise of empire made necessary a new philosophical outlook. Natural rights theory was their suggested solution. 17 This intellectual construct served Christian apologists as the epistemologica.1 foundation of a synthesis, a common-ground philoso- phy of justice. It was on the basis of supposedly shared philosophical first principles that the discovery of a shared moral universe was thought to be possible. From Justin Martyr to Gary Scott Smith, Christians have had faith in this shared universe of discourse. What we forget is that Justin was indeed a martyr, and a martyr under the rule of that most Stoicly philosophical of emperors, Marcus Aurelius. The hoped for common moral ground with Christianity did not exist in the eyes of the Emperors. This fact should have sent warnings to Justin’s successors down through the centuries. Unfor- 16.

They prefer to face the lions than to rethink their presuppositions regarding natural law philosophy. When it comes to political theory, their slogan is: “Better the lions of the Colosseum than the Lion of Judah.” The Se~-Destruction of Humanism Charles Darwin destroyed natural law theory in biological science. Evolution through natural selection replaced the older, Christianity-influenced humanist vision of fixed life forms moving steadily toward a harmonious ecosystem. His successors destroyed natural law theory in social science. 18 In the 1920’s, quantum physics destroyed natural law theory in the subatomic world. This immedi- ately began to undermine modern legal theory. As Harvard Law School’s Dean Roscoe Pound said in 1940, “Nothing has been so up- setting to political and juristic thinking as the growth of the idea of contingency in physics. It has taken away the analogy from which philosophers had reached the very idea of law. It has deprived politi- cal and juristic thought of the pattern to which they had conceived of government and law as set up. Physics had been the rock on which they had built.”lg The shattered foundation of natural law theory, like Humpty Dumpty, can never be put together again. Natural law theory is dead. Rigor mortis has set in. Like Lazarus after several days in the tomb, it stinketh. Unlike Lazarus, it cannot be resurrected. History does not move backward. But this means that a new theory of cosmic order must be found, if man’s social and political order is to be pre- served. This new discovery is needed immediately in order to prevent social collapse and war, yet it also is hoped by most social theorists that this radical ideological change will somehow not be revolution- ary or violent. Only one event can meet these two requirements: a rapid, massive, international revival of a single religion, to which men will voluntarily give their allegiance, either Christianity or anti- 18.

Several opti- mistic physicians are still hovering over the body, trying to breathe new life into the corpse. They will not appreciate my report on their patient’s condition, for it points to their own monumental failure in both diagnosis and treatment. I do not believe in zombies, but whenever I examine the philoso- phy of political pluralism, I wonder if my prejudice can be sup- ported. “It never sleeps, it walks, it crashes into things, yet it’s brain- dead. Nothing has stopped it in eighteen hundred years. Unchained, it has now gone berserk!” There are only two ways to stop a zombie in the movies: smash its skull or decapitate it. What Christian political pluralists steadfastly refuse to discuss is what the new foundation of political pluralism can possibly be, now that natural rights and natural law are intellectually dead concepts, and very nearly dead culturally. First, Christian scholars baptized Plato; then they baptized Aristotle; then they baptized Newton. Will they also baptize Heisenberg, Sartre, and Camus? If so, we can then expect the next public baptism: Nietzsche. What is the basis of the “grand ideological synthesis” between Christianity and anti-Christi- anity now that the very foundations of that ancient synthesis have collapsed from the erosion produced by the acids of modernity? They refuse to say, and their silence testifies to the intellectual bank- ruptcy of their position. Conclusion In this book, I survey the writings of Christian scholars who have been unwilling to face the implications of the death of natural law theory. I use them as representative examples. What I argue is that they have been intellectually schizophrenic, a fact revealed by their own diagnosis of the modern religious crisis. They have remained unwilling to choose between their commitment to the Bible and their commitment to political pluralism. They refuse to cross over into biblical covenant theology because of that great, immovable barrier that separates the political religion of man from the civil covenantal- ism of the Bible: biblical law.

With what right may we call ourselves children of the Reformation? Much modern Protestantism would be neither owned nor even recognised by the pioneer Reformers. The Bondage of the Will fairly sets before us what the y believed about the salvation of lost mankind. In the light of it, we are forced to ask whether Protestant Christendom has not tragically sold its birthright between Luthefs day and our own. Has not Protestantism to-day become more Erasmian than Lutheran? Do we not too often try to minimise and gloss over doctrinal differ- ences for the sake of inter-party peace? Are we innocent of the doc- trinal indifferentism with which Luther charged Erasmus? Do we still believe that doctrine matters? Or do we now, with Erasmus, rate a deceptive appearance of unity as of more importance than truth? Have we not grown used to an Erasmian brand of teaching from our pulpits – a message that rests on the same shallow synergistic con- ceptions which Luther refuted, picturing God and man approaching each other almost on equal terms, each having his own contribution to make to man’s salvation and each depending on the dutiful co- operation of the other for the attainment of that end? — as if God ex- ists for man’s convenience, rather than man for God’s glory?

The Threat of God’s Negative Sanctions For a little over three centuries, Protestant Christians have not taken Moses’ warning seriously. Throughout the Western world, men have substituted other gods and other explanations of the origin and destiny of man — not ancient gods of wood and stone, but mod- ern gods of their own imagination.

The threat of God’s negative covenantal sanctions hangs over all Christians who are citizens of any nation that has ever been formally covenanted to the God of the Bible, but which has been captured from within by covenant-breakers. These sanctions are real. In or- der to remove the perceived threat of such sanctions, one of the most important doctrines of “the gods of these nations” today is the denial that a biblically covenanted society is possible – that no such society has legitimately existed since the demise of Old Covenant Israel in A . D . 70. Therefore, all societies that have ever claimed to be Chris- tian have necessarily been fraudulent: examples to be shunned by Christians, not imitated. The priests of the religion of autonomous man cannot get all of God’s people to abandon their faith in the God of heaven, but they can and have succeeded in getting them to aban- don the belief that this God makes national collective covenants in the New Covenant era. The priests and academic Levites of God’s covenant people have also adopted this same covenant-denying doctrine in the name of biblical theology. 2 The humanists cry “peace, peace,” despite the bib- lical fact there is no possibility of permanent covenantal peace be- tween covenant-breakers and covenant-keepers. The Christians cry “cease-fire, cease-fire,” despite the biblical fact there is a real possibil- ity y for progressive earthly victory on God’s judicial terms, however imperfect due to sin’s effects. The result of both views — “peace, peace (on autonomous man’s terms)” and “cease-fire, cease-fire (on autonomous man’s terms)” is the same: a refusal by Christians to call for national repentance, a repentance manifested by taking a formal 2.

Christians refuse to press for social peace on God’s terms. They deny the need for national covenant renewal. And so we face God’s negative historical sanctions. Terms of Surrender The Bible teaches that there can and will be a progressive mani- festation of peace in history, s but only as a product of covenantal faithfulness in Church government, family government, and civil government. 4 God’s people today have almost universally assumed that peace in the third covenantal institution — civil government — is possible only on the “neutral” legal terms set forth by God’s enemies. Christians have surrendered conditionally to covenant-breakers na- tionally, on the promise that Christians will be left in peace in the first two covenantal categories, family and Church. 5 Covenant- breakers have in the past promised this conditional peace, but now they are making it increasingly clear that this was a lie, a politically necessary deception. They want unconditional surrender in all three areas. Thus, to defend God’s covenantal standards in the first two realms, Christians must now seek long-term victory in the third: civil government. But they are then told by their own spiritual spokesmen that such a quest is either wrong in principle or at least impossible to achieve in history. Political Po@heism: The Myth of Plu- ralism is a sustained attack on three representative variations of this familiar compromise. The theological root of our present political crisis is this: God de- mands unconditional surrender of all His enemies at the final judg- ment, and also the progressive, conditional, external surrender of Satan’s people to His people in history,G while Satan demands uncon- ditional surrender of his enemies in history, for he cannot gain this in eternity.

Each side is required by its respective covenantal head to seek a victory over the other side in every area of life. There is no neutralip. Christians, however, for the most part no longer believe that con- tinual conflict between mutually exclusive covenantal standards is in fact inevitable in the civil realm, so they have signed a temporary cease-fire which they hope will last until the final judgment. They hope and even occasionally pray that this will be a permanent cease- fire in history. They have voluntarily surrendered the fundamental principle of the sovereignty of God, as revealed by His covenantal law, as this law and its specified sanctions apply in the civil sphere. (Incredibly, this is frequently done in the name of the sovereignty of God. 7 These people are masters of deception.) Having surrendered the doctrine of the sovereign y of God in civil government, they are now in the process of surrendering it in the first two areas, family and Church, piece by piece. The rise of “Christian” counseling courses in our Bible-believing seminaries — courses based on pagan psychology texts and principles – is one example, and the practice of registering churches with the government in order to receive tax- subsidized mailing permits is another. “Peace, peace~ in fact means ‘surrender, Christians, piece by piece.” The Abandonment of Casuistry Political Po@heiwn deals with the process of piecemeal intellectual surrender. It will not win me academic friends or influence tenured people. Books by watchmen never do. It presents a case-by-case study of what I regard as representative intellectual compromises with humanism by contemporary Christian scholars. These intellec- tual compromises within the English-speaking Calvinist community have been going on for over three centuries, and within the rest of Christendom for at least eighteen centuries. From time to time in re- cent years, it has looked as though this systematic program of intellec- tual compromise was about to cease in some key Christian commando units, but each time, senior officers have put down their battle flags and have signed cease-fire agreements with the enemy. This is dis- couraging for those of us who remain on the battlefield. 7. Cf.

Why? For one thing, I am more familiar with modern Calvinist philosophy and social theory. For another, those closest to you are always the greatest threat. You have to answer their criticisms and expose their deviations before you get on with the war for civilization. 8 Far more important, however, is the fact that the other Protestant traditions have been generally less devoted to the academic areas of philosophy, social theory, and historical studies. Calvinists believe in the absolute sovereignty of the Creator God over every aspect of the universe, and they are therefore the only biblical theological movement that can sustain serious scholarship, generation after generation. What the Calvinists have written (and I include here Augustine) g has es- tablished both the intellectual standards and the targets. When the Calvinists get philosophically “squishy,” we can be reasonably confi- dent that their imitators and critics in the other Protestant traditions are even more squishy, and surely no tougher. CasuistV, 1673-1973 The problem facing the West today is that for three centuries, 1673 to 1973, Protestant Christians abandoned the intellectual disci- pline of casuist~ – applied biblical morality — and thereby abandoned the crucial task of developing an explicitly and exclusively biblical social theory. 10 In the seventeenth century, English casuists had writ- ten their works in English, aiming their message at the general pop- ulation. 11 They provided elaborate discussions of the general biblical 8. This is why cults, revolutionary organizations, and other hard-core ideologi- cal groups tend to excommunicate or purge heretics and apostates more readily than attack ‘the “heathen” outside the camp.

The same screening strategy is used in Christian academia to remove all those who are not committed to the program of epistemologicrd com- promise.

The result, predictably, has been an increase of heterodox Christians. 16 Without biblical guidance from God’s covenant people, the whole world is now adrift in the rapids with a shattered rudder and a conked-out engine.

A few manuals on direct action wouldn’t hurt, either. 24 Before this task can be accomplished, however, Christians must jettison the last three centuries of philosophical compromise.

Yet even Van Til was unwilling to ‘go the distance” in this race. He dem- onstrated what is wrong and has been wrong with Christian philoso- phy for almost two millennia – the compromise with Greece’s phi- losophy of autonomous man – but he did not offer a workable positive alternative. Analogical Reasoning Van Til’s analogies are marvelous. He convinced me that analogies can be very helpful in communicating difficult concepts. So let me use four of them to describe what he did, and what he failed to do. First, it is not sufficient to blow up humanism’s dikes when you live in epistemological Holland, for these are the only dikes in place today. You need a new structure in place to keep out the North Sea before the explosives are detonated. Van Til, however, went ahead and lit the fuses anyway. The best you can say for his plan is that he used slow-burning fuses. Most of the dikes are still intact. Second, Van Til showed that the humanist Emperor and his sub- jects have always worn clothes stolen from Christians, and only the existence of these clothes has kept everyone even tolerably warm in the freezing winters. Furthermore, the Emperor is now requiring Christians to produce only Emperor-designed clothing, a sure sign of looming frostbite. But Van Til then steadfastly refused to recom- mend an appropriate Christian clothier for Christians whose ward- robes have been depleted. Third, Van Til created an ethical and epistemological vacuum by his successful extrusion of the Greeks from Christian philosophy, but then he insisted privately that nothing specific should be allowed to rush in to fill it. Creating a physical vacuum takes special instru- ments and a lot of energy. So, too, with epistemological vacuums. To create such a vacuum, you must first force out bad ideas with good ideas. When you then withdraw the plunger of good ideas from the intellectual flask, but without allowing bad ideas to return, you create a vacuum. Vacuums are, artificial creations; they cannot be sustained, long term. They are not very useful outside the labora- tory, either. Scholars resent an epistemological vacuum in the same way that nature abhors a physical one on earth. The valves cannot hold tight forever; something will inevitably fill it: if not biblical law,"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Introduction 9 then something else. As I show in Chapter 4, one of Van Til’s early students rushed in to fill it. What he filled it with was a variation of the same old impure mixture that Van Til had expelled in the first place: one-third Bible, one-third natural law philosophy, and one- third verbal gymnastics to explain why there really is no underlying conflict between the two except, of course, in those cases where there is. This is the problem. This has always been the problem. Fourth, Van Til forgot rule number-one in all warfare: “You can’t beat something with nothing.” Adopting military metaphors, we can say that Van Til wrote a multi-volume theory of war. It took him all his life to write it. He never really finished it. It just got longer and longer. Unfortunately, he never offered an overall strat- egy showing how his general theory of war could be applied to a strategy of conquest in history. His theory showed only that all past Christian strategies have failed because of improper military alliances and disastrous treaties. Problem: knowing what failed to work before is not the same as knowing what strategy will lead to vic- tory in the future. Van Til did not believe in the possibility y of a visi- ble victory by Christians in history. He therefore never wrote a grand strategy or even any tactical manuals, which is what new recruits and newly commissioned second lieutenants need. Now What Should We Do? Van Til steadfastly refused to tell anyone what to do with his phi- losophical discoveries. He did not encourage his disciples, such as R. J. Rushdoony, who were attempting to apply his discoveries to other fields of thought, including social theory. Privately, he actually discouraged such attempts; they made him nervous. He carefully avoided venturing outside of the academic specialization of apolo- getics — a narrowly philosophical defense of the faith — and even when he did (e. g., The Psycholo~ of Religion), he concealed the fact by writing as if he were dealing strictly with apologetics. The result of his reticence has been confusion: hardly anyone claims to be his dis- ciple today – he actually discouraged discipleszs – and those who do claim to be his disciples are scattered all over the philosophical and 25. For example, he would not assign his own books in his apologetics classes. It was as if John Calvin or Luther had remained content to assign Summu Theological to his students, hoping to clear up their confusion with rambling, disjointed lectures. Let me assure you, Van Til specialized in rambling, disjointed lectures."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"10 POLITICAL POLYTHEISM political landscape. 26 So here I come, trying to rally the troops, scattered though they may be. I think Christianity’s biggest battles are still to be fought in the future; what we have seen so far is simply a series of “boot camps” for God’s people, a long period of wandering in the wilder- ness. I think we are at last being called to invade Canaan. But I may be like Joshua and Caleb when they returned from their recon- naissance assignment; I may be premature in my recommendation. Judging from the number of stones that I see people in the camp col- lecting (Num. 14:10), I am beginning to suspect that my timing is off by a generation. What, then, is the proper tactic today for calling God’s people to begin making preparations for a gigantic offensive operation? My solution: to risk being regarded as offensive. Tactics in a Time of Reformation In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue. In 1493, he and his crew returned, bringing tales of a new world. Some of them also brought back something else: syphilis. By 1497, it had spread throughout Western Europe. By 1507, it had reached China. 27 An in- visible army of tiny creatures began to undermine the foundations of European civilization. Physicians soon realized how this army was being transmitted, but biological education alone was not sufficient to stop it. It never is. This mortal disease contributed to a wide- spread loss of confidence within the Renaissance world, just as the bubonic plague had undermined the self-confidence of the late- medieval world. 28 Then came the Protestant Reformation. The Protestant Reformation was launched by a doctor of theol- ogy in 1517. He was a university man (Martin Luther). His major public opponent was also a doctor of theology (John Eck), but in this case, the gentleman was also in the pay of Europe’s leading family of 26.

And organizing the shock troops of the academic opposition was a former classmate of Calvin’s at the University of Paris (Ignatius of Loyola). Era.wnus and Luther Sitting on the sidelines of this historic battlefield with a pile of an- cient manuscripts on his desk was Erasmus of Rotterdam, another University of Paris product. w Erasmus knew that Luther was cor- rect in many of his criticisms of the Roman Church, but Erasmus re- garded himself as a man of peace, a man of the Roman Church. Erasmus did not want to make a frontal assault against the Roman Church’s concepts of justification, the sacraments, and hierarchy. “His spirituality inclined him to agree with the more radical refor- mers ,“ writes historian Roland Bainton. “Nevertheless Erasmus refused to join the radicals because of his regard for concordia and consensus. He would not have these disrupted by constraint from either side .“31 At first, he avoided going into print against Luther. After all, his goal was “peace, peace.’ Luther finally forced Erasmus out of his academic complacency when he publicly defended the doctrine of predestination. Erasmus was aghast. Predestination? In this day and age? And so the two doctors of theology fought it out: free will vs ~ God’s absolute sovereignty. 32 Luther’s classic reply to Erasmus, The Bondage of the Will (1525), stands as one of the most important defenses of predestination ever written. He was true to his Augusti- nian heritage. (He regarded this work and his catechism for children as his only works worth preserving; only they were “right .“) 33 Melanchthon But then, as also happened to Augustine’s predestinarian legacy 29.

Augustine had battled against Pelagius, for the latter had dropped the doctrine of innate human depravity. Pelagius had adopted free will doctrines as a direct result. Augustine won the in- tellectual battle, but his heirs surrendered anyway. So it was to be with Luther’s heirs. Luther’s close associate Philip Melanchthon never adopted Luther’s view of predestination, calling it “Stoic fatal- ism.”w Melanchthon was a classicist at heart, and he wanted peace with Greece. Writes C. L. Manschreck: At first Melanchthon joined Luther in heaping invectives on Aristotle and philosophy in general, for both recognized that certain modes and prin- ciples of reasoning were injurious to the evangelical religious insights, but Philip soon came to feel that philosophy might be a valuable auxiliary in the propagation of truth. Melanchthon’s changed view toward Aristotle, espe- cially after 1525, did not represent a desire to give up the fruits of the Refor- mation but a more mature understanding of philosophy and its usefulness in education and the Christian community. Luther went along. % And so Melanchthon called a mighty ecclesiastical army away from a direct frontal assault against Greece and Rome — not the Roman Church, but the far more ancient enemy, classical Rome. That army has never returned to the front. Lutheran apologetics to this day is basically the Thomistic apologetics of the Roman Church, which is also true of Protestantism in general. 36 A Study ah Irrelevance Through all this turmoil, Erasmus stayed calm, cool, and col- lected. He did not break with Rome. He did not leave his study ex- cept to lecture at a university or return a book to the library. He read his Greek manuscripts, wrote his prevaricating but clever academic essays, and kept his wits about him. No fiery pamphlets in the ver- nacular from his pen! Also, no fiery stakes for his sensitive flesh. He was, after all, a cultivated man. 37 A fully accredited man. A tenured man. A man for mild seasons. 34.

It kept him out of serious trouble. It brought him external peace. It also made him irrelevant to the titanic religious struggles of his age. Luther’s response describes him to a T: “Erasmus is an eel. Only Christ can get him.”39 The sad fact is that most of those in the pulpit today take Erasmus as their model. The result is slippery sermons. The typical Christian liberal arts college is even worse. There the eels have tenure. The ideal American academic is also modeled on the career of Erasmus. So is the Christian academic, to the extent that he has a separate existence. (Not British academia, however, by the grace of God and the example of A. J. P. Taylor). One is ex- pected to conduct oneself as a cultivated man. No pamphlets, please. No use of incendiary language. No departing from the accepted eti- quette of professional academic discourse. Above all, there must be no calling to the attention of uncertified laymen (who pay all the bills with their donations) the unpleasant fact that there has been a sys- tematic sell-out of Christian civilization by its officially accredited in- tellectual and political defenders. This is Erasmus’ legacy, and it is staunchly defended today by those inside the halls of ivy. They much prefer In Praise of Fol~ to The Bondage of the Will. Anyone seeking acceptance within these halls of ivy must either conform or be thrown out, thereafter to spend his days wandering in the wastelands of the business world or high school teaching. Erasmus was illegitimate by birth, but his heirs are self-made men. Fighting to Win I prefer Luther’s model. Luther was courageous enough not only to break ranks with the Church of Rome, but also with the etiquette of Erasmus. He took his criticisms of the Roman Church to unor- dained people in their own language, both linguistically and stylisti- cally, and he thereby broke the Church’s sacramental monopoly. He was hated for this. He changed the face of Europe, and he was hated for this, too. He conducted himself not as a gentleman and a scholar, but as a man of war who understood that eternal souls were hanging 38. E.

His contemporaries wanted peace. This gave Luther an enormous advantage. He wanted victory, and he developed his tactics accordingly. Luther was the pioneer of the pugnacious pamphlet, as well as the vicar of vitriol and the rector of ridicule. He adopted Augustine’s rule: anything that is ridiculous deserves to be ridiculed.40 His spiritual heirs have conveniently for- gotten about the scatological cartoons of the Pope that Luther put in his pamphlets. Had he restricted his expressions of theological oppo- sition to the Roman Church by the accepted rules of discourse with- in the academic community, there would probably have been no Reformation in his day. He would have been burned at the stake. Instead, the authorities had to content themselves with burning his pamphlets. Luther’s academic peers wanted peace. So do most of his spiri- tual and institutional heirs today. Well, they won’t all be able to get it . . . at least not while I’m alive and have a word processor in front of me. And not while AIDS is spreading, either. C. Everett Koop’s sol- ution to AIDS is condoms. This will not work. My critics’ solution to me is public silence and private murmuring. This will not work, either. There is only one strategy that can possibly shut me up, or at least remove me as a serious combatant: prove in print, point by point and verse by verse, that my theology is dead wrong and so is my analysis of the long-term compromise with humanism; commu- nicate this in language that literate Christians can understand; and then spend as much time and money as I spend in getting this message to the as yet undecided troops. My prediction: not very likely; Erasmus lost the polemical battle – though not the academic eti- quette battle – because he viewed the battlefield of the Reformation in terms of the scholar’s study. He decided to avoid engaging in pro- tracted conflict. He refused to face the fact that protracted conflict is all that the followers of Jesus Christ have ever been promised on earth, even during the m~ennium. Christians are told to find inter- nal peace in the midst of a raging battle. This is no doubt difficult, but however it is to be accomplished, surrendering the battalion’s battle flag is not the proper way.

But at least I know this much: I cannot hope to lead anyone to victory in my assigned sector of this battle for civilization by imitating Erasmus’ reputed strengths. I have at least a possibility of contributing to the victory of Christ’s kingdom in history by adopting what many of his heirs re- gard as LutheFs embarrassing weaknesses. There is, however, one important difference between my style and Luther’s. The confrontation between Erasmus and Luther has been described as “a duel in which the two participants got up at the crack of dawn, one armed with a rapier, the other with a blunder- buss. . . .“41 Erasmus wielded the rapier, Luther the blunderbuss. I do much better with a rapier. Creationism, Neo-Evangelical Style This book is designed to clear the deck ideologically. I show what cannot work biblically and has not worked for over three centuries, By attacking Christian political pluralism, I am attacking a sacred cow which is in fact a long-dead mule. It is an intellectual system which cannot be successfully defended by an appeal to the Bible, and which is regarded by humanists as intellectually peripheral to the concerns of the non-Christian world. Christian political pluralism is to modern political theory what theistic evolution is to modern bio- logical science: a sell-out of Christianity to the humanists who run the academic world. The irony is that the humanists regard the whole charade of theistic evolution as either a crude intellectual joke or else a self-serving fraud deserving of contempt.4Z Christian politi- cal pluralism is not much better respected in the world of humanist scholarship. We should not be surprised to learn that the same undergraduate Christian academic institutions and publishing houses support both forms of this ideological sell-out. I call this the Wheaton- Westchester-Downers Grove-Grand Rapids-Wenham-Toronto com- plex. Wheaton College is the model.Aq 41. Rupp, op. cit., p. 2. 42.

They proclaim God’s creation in general, hoping thereby 1) to retain donors’ support and a stream of young Christian students to capture; 44 and 2) to avoid the radical despair of modern humanist science. 45 By refusing to affirm six-day creationism, they hope to accomplish at least three things: 1) retain their accreditation from humanist accrediting agencies; 2) retain the approval of other neo-evangelical academicians, who have long since abandoned orthodoxy for Barthianism or liberation theology; and 3) leave the door open to just about any kind of theoretical compromise with the “latest finding of modern science ,“ meaning the scientific views of a decade ago that are now working their way into the text- books. They want the benefits of orthodoxy with none of the liabilities. Similarly, they affirm something called God’s “creation or- dinances .“ % Sometimes, they call this a “creation ethic.”47 This sounds so very biblical. But they simultaneously deny that Old Tes- tament law in any way provides the definitions, specific content, and intellectual limits of these ordinances. Their goals here are much the same as with their affirmation of creationism, but not six-day cre- ationism. First, they can still sound as though they affirm the Bible, 44.

That is the heart and soul of neo-evangelicalism: intellectually and morally open-ended. T. M. Moore is correct: “Ultimately, Spykman exalts God’s revelation in nature above the Bible.

Sec- ond, they can then read the latest (i. e., decade-old) fads of political liberalism into these “creation ordinances.” They get the benefits of God’s doctrine of creation without any of the restraints of God’s Bible-revealed law. These scholars are like unmarried couples who live together under the protection of common law marriage precedents. If these unions can survive for five consecutive years, they become techni- cally legal marriages for purposes of ownership and inheritance.

White Uniforms and Sinking Ships The doctrine of Christian political pluralism rested from the be- ginning on the doctrine of natural rights and natural law. That com- forting faith is now forever dead, buried by the spiritual heirs of the pagan Greeks who invented it in the first place. This loss of faith in natural law is admitted even by defenders of Christian political plur- alism. % Nevertheless, they stubbornly refuse to admit publicly that without this key epistemologica14g assumption, political pluralism becomes a visibly drifting ship with a hole in its side. The Leaking Ship This ship is taking on water fast. It is already 2,000 miles out to sea, with no radio on board and very little dehydrated food re- maining. A huge storm is on the horizon. There is only one hope available: a motorized lifeboat with a good set of maps, a compass, and enough fuel to get a few hundred miles. It even has an emer- gency sail. But there is one catch: its name. The former owner of the shipping line — who still holds a second mortgage on the company, and the present owners are several payments behind — named it the 48. Cf.

They keep announcing the following message over the ship’s intercom: “The ship is fine. No problem. Don’t worry; be happy! Be calm, be cool, and be collected.” Meanwhile, the storm clouds keep getting closer, and the ship is listing to port. Question: Should the passengers rearrange the deck chairs one more time or head for the lifeboat? I have made my decision; what about you? There are a lot of passengers who still take the ship’s officers seri- ously. They still have faith in what they are being told rather than what they can clearly see. After all, these officers are so . . . so oJjl - cial ! They are all dressed in clean, white uniforms. Could they really be wrong? Could a man in a white uniform be unreliable? (See Chapter 4.) They were certified by the authorities back on shore. Could the authorities have been wrong? The thought never crosses the passengers’ minds that the authorities back on shore had cut a deal with the ship’s owners: We will certify your ship and your crew if you continue publicly to support our right to certi~ everyone. And we promise to prohibit any uncertified rival entrepreneur from start- ing a rival cruise ship line .“ In the world of business this is called licensing. In the academic world, it is called regional accreditation and classroom tenure. What this system of certification invariably produces in the long run is a fleet of high-priced leaking ships and a new generation of white uni- formed officers who don’t know how to navigate. But they do look impressive. The purpose of this book is to show what does not work, and then to offer an alternative. Like an informed passenger on that leaking ship, I need to alert my fellow passengers to the problem before I can expect them to head for the lifeboat. I have confidence that the life- boat is sea-worthy. 50 I also’ have confidence that the ship is sinking.

The people of England were not ready for a world without king or bishops, and Calvinist intellectual and military leaders soon found that they could not control the social forces that their pamphlets and their cavalry had unleashed. The growing reaction against “the rule of the saints” during the 1650’s, and especially after the restoration of Charles II to the English throne in 1660, devastated English and Scottish Calvin- ism. The y never recovered. English and American colonial Calvin- ism became pietistic and antinomian within a generation. 51 So did Holland’s Calvinism during this same period. Few traces of postmil- lennialism can be found in Dutch Calvinism after 1700. Radical En- lightenment ideas and clandestine political org~izations had been released as a side-effect of the Puritan Revolution in England; they spread rapidly to Holland in the 1690’s, and from there to the whole of Europe. 52 so did the Christian-Newtonian synthesis and its accompanying Arminianism and Socinianism. 53 It does not pay to be premature. It is not my intention to encourage the repetition of that seventeenth- century mistake. Productive social transformation takes time and lots of it. Great religious and social discontinuities are inevitable in human history, but in order to produce beneficial results, they must be preceded by and followed by long periods of patient and disci- plined thought, investment, and work. 54 In this sense, I am a conser- vative social theorist. I see an enormous discontinuity looming, and 51.

It is easy to tear down a society; it is not easy to rehabilitate one. Free Grace and Good Works The road to the comprehensive peace of God begins with the transformation of the covenant-breaking heart. Personal regenera- tion must precede comprehensive social reconstmction. This has always been the position of Christian Reconstruction. “The key to social regeneration is individual renewal,” wrote Rushdoony in 1973. 55 But we must begin this process of reconstruction with confi- dent faith in the gospel; we must be confident that God’s salvation is as comprehensive as sin is. 56 Rushdoony is correct: “To limit salva- tion to man’s soul and not to his body, his society, and his every aspect and relationship, is to deny its Biblical meaning.”57 The process of spiritual renewal should be the Christians’ model for institutional renewal: a realization of sin and its disastrous conse- quences, a definitive judicial break with the power of sin, a lifetime of progressive subduing of the sinful tendencies of the heart, and a steady maturing in the faith over time. It is a matter of faith and its inevitable product, good works. Our faith, Paul writes, is not of good works but to good works. For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God bath before ordained that we should walk in them (Eph. 2:8-10). It is true, no doubt, that criticism of the existing social syqtem will tend to undermine it. But criticism is not the primary cause of the destruction of any social system; God’s historical sanctions against it — internal and external= — are the cause. To return to the analogy of the ship: there is a hole in its side and a storm on the horizon. We should not quibble over the negative effect on the passengers of a private call to abandon ship; the real question is whether the - ship’s crew will do anything constructive in time, either 55.

Better to blame the alarmists on board. What I am proposing is a social transformation that will take centuries to develop. The problem is, the storm clouds are looming now. We may not have much time to begin the process. By “we,” I mean Christians in general. What we need to do is get experience in the little things of social life: establishing private Christian schools; beginning local social welfare programs, funded by voluntary dona- tions; launching local political campaigns; starting Bible studies. We must prove that the gospel works before we can expect non-Christians or pietistic Christians to trust the Bible for the larger things. The problem is, we – a minority, Christian activist “we” – may find ourselves under the spotlight before we are ready. The interna- tional financial system could collapse overnight, and the response of frightened politicians could create an international economic col- lapse to m-atch the financial collapse. In such a scenario, will churches be ready to exercise leadership locally? If not, they will get a lot of “on the job training” in the middle of a massive international crisis. (If this crisis does turn out to be a debt-created crisis, it will be fitting and proper. The rise of the Enlightenment was closely con- nected to the rise of central banking, with the Bank of England as the model. 59 That experiment in private inflation, bureaucratic expan- sion, and political control — so popular with economists and his- torians — began in 1694 and remains with us today.) Case Laws and Communion If society in general can begin to see, case by case, that the case laws of the Old Testament really do bring positive visible results, people will be far more ready to replace a dying pagan civilization with a comprehensively, covenantally Christian civilization.

They must also regain confidence in weekly communion, the place where God meets with His people judicially. All of this may seem unlikely today. What is likely, however, is that the ship really is sinking. We have to do something. Christians must regain confidence that God exercises power in history, and that our Bible has the answers. Our God is not a loser, in time or eternity, nor are His representatives, regenerate Chris- tians. Triumphalism is a legitimate biblical attitude, but it must first be tested in the trenches of life.

We must do a lot of good before we can legitimately ex- pect to do very well.G2 Conclusion This book presents the case against any compromise with politi- cal pluralism. With respect to Christian political pluralism itself, there is no Bible-based case. From Milton’s Areopagitica (1644) to Richard John Neuhaus’ The Naked Public Square (1984), there has been no case. There has not been a single, well-developed, self- consciously biblical exposition of the case. We have waited patiently for well over three centuries. Christian political pluralists still have yet to produce the equivalent of Rushdoon~s Institutes of Biblical Law. Yet they write as though the dogma of democratic pluralism had been etched on the back side of the original tablets of the law, as though Moses presided over an incipient Rhode Island. They write as though they were sitting upon a mountain of supporting literature. This reminds me of the gambler’s wad: a roll of thirty one-dollar bills with a fifty dollar bill at each end. It looks impressive when you first see it, but watch carefully when he peels off that $50. 61. According to European scholar and former U.N. official Ernst Winter, Chris- tian women in the Soviet Union for many decades have been assigned this unplea- sant but necessary task. They are the toilet bowl ladies of Russia. 62. Colonel V.

The question of legitimate rule also is: In whose name, by whose authority, by what standard, with what sanctions, and for how long? Christian political pluralists have promised that they can supply us with the answers, if only we remain patient. I am hereby calling their bluff. It is time for Bible-believing Christians to stop comprom- ising with the humanists who are the beneficiaries of the system, and stop listening to their paid agents in the Christian college classroom. We need to make a clean break ideologically, and then patiently work out the practical implications of this break over many, many years. What we have seen for over three centuries is a stream of compromises: in late seventeenth-century England, late eighteenth- century America, and late nineteenth-century Holland. Let us end it in late twentieth-century America. We are asked generation after generation to sell our birthright for a mess of pottage. Each genera- tion complies. We keep selling it cheaper.

Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard, Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand con- tinually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.

When I first wrote Chapter 3 on the Christian philosophy of Cornelius Van Til, I sent a copy to John Frame of Westminster Theological Seminary. He was gracious enough to evaluate it. He complained about one aspect of my critique, my accusation that Van Til was an antinomian. By any standard definition in the history of the Church, Frame said, Vari Til was not an antinomian. He asked: Why did I insist on using a word that has a very different meaning for most Christian readers? Good question. I hope I can supply a good answer. My view of law – biblical law – is now governed by the five-point biblical cove- nant. 1 This five-point model defines the nature of biblical law as point three in a covenant structure. It is not enough, biblically speaking, to insist on belief in biblical law as the sole criterion for es- tablishing a Christian’s commitment to, or opposition to, the “nom- ian” position. It is necessary that a person affirm all five points. As surely as Calvinist Van Til and Calvinist Frame would insist that a definition of “Calvinist” include ~ five points of Calvinism – total depravity, unconditional election, limited atonement (i.e., particular redemption), irresistible grace, and the perseverance of the saints — so do I demand that “antinomianism” be defined in terms of the five points of the biblical covenant model.

In Chapter 1, I define antinwniamkn and pro-nomianism in terms of the covenant’s five points. I realize that I am departing from the ac- cepted definitions offered by the historical Church. This is neces- sary; I am also departing from the Church’s long-term reluctance to define and apply the covenant. l Once we see what this covenant model is, we can then pursue its proper application in the area of civil government. What is a citizen in a biblical commonwealth? What is a stranger? What is the legal authority of each? Why was Old Testament Israel’s system of sanc- tuary closely connected to its system of political exclusion of strangers? Only when we see what the Old Testament model of the citizen is can we begin to discuss the question of the restoration of the holy commonwealth in New Testament times. It is the unwillingness of Christian commentators and social theorists to return to the biblical record of Old Covenant that is the heart of the problem. Because they will not look at biblical law as the model, Christians are left without specifics for organizing society. This leaves them in the difficult position of denying the continuing validity of judicial standards set forth in the Old Testament, yet simultaneously claiming that “the Bible has answers for all of life,” a claim which disinte~ates on contact as soon as someone asks a spe- cific political or judicial question regarding civil government. Christian social theorists have recognized their vulnerability in this regard for many centuries. Their solution is always about the same: find some prevailing humanist program or worldview in con- temporary society which has been “proven” to be valid by someone who claims he is using natural law, and then baptize it with a few ‘ Bible verses. This is “we, too” Christianity. This approach does not change covenant-breaking culture; it sinks or swims with it. Usually the former. In modern times, even this natural law approach has failed. With the collapse of natural law theory under the onslaught of Dar- winism, existentialism, and modern quantum physics, the anti- nomian Christian social theorist is left utterly defenseless. He has nothing specific to say, at least not with any authority. He is just one more timid voice in a cacophony of recommendations. He just makes things up as he goes along.

Theology must always be undergoing reformation. The human understanding is imperfect. However architectonic may be the systematic constructions of any one generation or group of generations, there always remains the need for correction and reconstruction so that the structure may be brought into closer approximation to Scripture and the reproduction be a more faithful transcript or reflection of the heavenly exemplar. It appears to me that the covenant theology, notwithstanding the finesse of analysis with which it was worked out and the grandeur of its articulated systematization, needs recasting. We would not pre- sume to claim that we shall be so successful in this task that the reconstruction will displace and supersede the work of the classic covenant theologians.

These verses teach clearly the law of God is a tool of worldwide evangelism. The nations of the earth will recognize the justice that is provided by God’s revealed law, as well as see the external blessings that inevitably come to any society that covenants itself to God, and subsequently adheres to the ethical terms of God’s covenant. It is crucially important to maintain that these blessings will be visible (Deut. 28:1-14).

This, God promised, would be the visible sign of Israel’s wisdom, visible to the ends of the earth. It is not remarkable that humanists deny the existence of this covenantal and historical cause-and-effect relationship, for such a re- lationship points beyond history to the existence of a sovereign Creator and Judge who will hold them eternally responsible on judg- ment day.

They believe that the cause-and-effect relationship between obedience to God’s law and His positive blessings in history is just barely true within the socially and culturally narrow confines of the local church congregation and the Christian family. With respect to the authority of God’s law in society, fundamentalist Christians deny it, neo-evangelical scholars deny it, and even traditional Reformed theologians deny it, and for a similar reason: such a view of God’s law makes Christians personally and corporately responsible for obeying God, receiving the promised external blessings, and using this real-world capital for the fulfillment God’s dominion covenant 1 — extending his kingdom (civilization) across the face of the earth. In contrast, Christian Reconstructionists loudly affirm biblical law as a means of both evangelism and dominion. Indeed, the aJ%na- tion of a long-term relationship between covenant-keeping and external blessings in history, as well as covenant-breaking and external cursings in history, is t~ heart and soul of the Christian Reconstructionist position on social theo~, its theological identl~ying mark. z This overwhelming confidence in the long-term historical efficacy of the biblical covenant is the reason why Christian Reconstructionists self-consciously claim to be the most consistent of all covenant theologians in history. It is also why we are confident that our view of the biblical covenant will eventu- ally be triumphant in history. After all, God blesses covenant-keep- ing in history, and covenant-believing is surely an integral aspect of covenant-keeping. No doubt our confidence makes us insufferable in other theological circles, but such is always the effect of faith in God’s covenant. Pharaoh found Moses insufferable, and he banished Moses from his presence (Ex. 10:28). The Hebrew leaders had ear- lier tried to do the same thing (Ex. 5:19-21). Bear in mind that Moses refused to leave Egypt until he took the people with him. Christian Reconstructionists have the same attitude.

God intends His cove- nant to work this way: “But thou shah remember the L ORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day” (Deut. 8:18). In short: more obedience, more blessings; more blessings, more confirmation; more confirmation, greater obedience. This is covenantal positive feedback in history. This is Christianity’s stan- dard of ethical performance, both personally and corporately. 3 God brings His sanctions in history, positive and negative, in terms of men’s public conformity to His revealed law. We have read that the power to get wealth is one of God’s positive covenant sanctions in history. 4 This is a New Testament teaching, too: “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and com- eth down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning” (James 1:17). How is this steadfastness of God revealed in history? By the predictability of His historical sanc- tions in response to men’s responses to the unchanging principles of His covenant law. Conversely – much to the outrage of political lib- erals and most academic neo-evangelicals — long-run poverty is one of God’s negative sanctions in history. 5 Such a view of history is un- acceptable to the Christian world generally, and especially to univer- sity-trained Christian intellectuals. Why? Because such a view is ut- terly hostile to the God-denying worldview of Darwinism, which contemporary Christians have adopted far more than they are aware of. Darwinism teaches that there is no supernatural force in history. Until the advent of man, there was no direction to history, no moral- ity, and no purpose. Only with the appearance of man in history does cosmic personalism appear. Man proposes, and man disposes. Man extends dominion in the name of the human species. Man, and only man, brings meaningful sanctions in history. Autonomous man . 3. These sanctions apply more clearly to corporate bodies than to individuals, mther than the other way around, contrary to what pietism teaches. We know that righteous individual covenant-keepers can suffer cursings in history, as the Book of Job teaches. What the Bible teaches is that in the aggregate (corporately), and in the long run, God’s covenant sanctions are reliable and predictable. 4. Gary North, “Free Market Capitalism,” in Robert G.

It reflects what I call halfway covenant thinking. ‘T%o-nomianismn Defined , What do I mean by the term “antinomian”? To answer this, I need to offer a description of “pro-nomianism,” meaning a defense of what God’s law is and what it accomplishes, especially in history.

I use this model to develop the “pro-nomianism” of Christian Reconstruction. It is the basis of my definition of anti-nomianism. I use the biblical covenant model as the source of definition because I have long maintained that language as well as everything else must be governed by the Bible. As I wrote in 1973, “Neutrality does not exist. Everything must be interpreted in terms of what God has re- vealed. The humanistic goal of neutral language (and therefore neu- tral law) was overturned at the Tower of Babel. Our dejnitions must be in terms of biblical revelation.”ls As a representative example of the structure of the biblical cove- nant, I have selected Isaiah 45. From it we can get some sense of how the covenant works in history. We can also discuss the covenant’s relation to biblical law. 11.

Transcendence/Immanence We must begin where the Bible does: the creation of all things by God (Gen. 1:1). We must maintain an absolute distinction between the Creator and the creature. God is the absolutely sovereign Master of all that comes to pass in history. Nothing takes place outside His sovereign decree. “I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the L ORD do all these things” (Isa. 45:7).14 “I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I com- manded” (Isa. 45:12). “For thus saith the L ORD that created the heav- ens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he bath estab- lished it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the Lord; and there is none else” (Isa. 45:18). Isaiah uses the familiar (but extremely unpopular) biblical imag- ery of the potter and his clay: “Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd [strive] with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioned it, What makest thou? Or thy work, He bath no hands? Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou? Or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?” (Isa. 45:9-10). 15 These words became the basis of Paul’s argument regarding the absolute sovereignty of God in choos- ing to save one person and not another. It is the classic argument in the Bible for the doctrine of election. Paul says of Pharaoh: “For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth” (Rem. 9:17). This explains the words in Exodus: “And he hardened Pharaoh’s heart, that he heark- ened not unto them; as the L ORD had said” (Ex. 7:13). But this means that God keeps some men from responding positively to the universal offer of salvation. This keeps them from obeying His word. The believer in free will (a degree of human autonomy outside of God’s eternal decree) then asks: “How can any sinner therefore be personally responsible for his sin?” Paul well understood this line of reasoning, to which he replied: 14. This does not mean that God is the author of sin. This verse speaks covenant- ally: God brings evil times to those who defy Him. 15. I have used brackets to indicate the italicized inserted word of the King James translators. Normally, I do not do this, preferring instead not to disrupt the flow of biblical language. But my arguments here are sufficiently controversial that I do not want critics saying that I relied on the translators to make my points."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"What Is Covenant Law? 37 Therefore bath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. Thou wilt say then unto me, Why cloth he yet find fault? For who bath resisted his will? Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor? (Rem. 9:19-21), Paul appealed directly to the biblical doctrine of creation – the imagery of the potter and the clay — in order to cut short every ver- sion of the free will (man’s autonomy) argument. There is no area of chance or contingency in history. None. It is unlawful even to appeal to this line of reasoning, Paul said: Who art thou that thou repliest against God?” The doctrine of the moral and legal responsibility of man before God must always be understood in terms of the absolute decree of God; it must never be defended in terms of the idea that man has a zone of uncontrolled decision-making at his disposal. Man’s responsibility must be understood therefore in terms of the biblical doctrine of creation. God decrees, yet men are responsible. The biblical doctrine of creation teaches the sovereignty of God in electing some people to salvation. This is why so few Christians accept the biblical doctrine of the six-day creation, and why they are ready to compromise with this or that version of evolution. They want to affirm the partial sovereignty (partial autonomy) of man. They do so in terms of the pagan idea of chance: a realm of decision- making, of cause and effect, outside of God’s absolute providential control and absolute predestination. They refuse to accept the words of Paul in Ephesians: “According as he bath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: Having predestinated us unto the adop- tion of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will” (Eph. 1:4-5). The biblical doctrine of creation leads directly and inescapably to the biblical doctrine of the absolute providence of God. God creates and sustains all things in history. Speaking of Christ, Paul writes: “For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or domin- ions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things con- sist” (Col. 1:16-17).

There is no area that is outside the eternal decree of God or the law"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"38 POLITICAL POLYTHEISM of God. This is the biblical doctrine of creation. Humanists hate it, and so do the vast majority of Christians today. God as Creator brings all things to pass. When He says, “It shall come to pass,” it comes to pass. “Declaring the end from the begin- ning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, say- ing, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure” (Isa. 46:10). God does not simply know the future that He predicts; He causes the future to take place. There is no element of chance any- where in the universe. Consider the greatest crime in history: the betrayal and crucifix- ion of Jesus Christ. The act of betrayal by Judas was predetermined by God; nevertheless, Judas was still held fully responsible for this act. “And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!” (Luke 22:22). And what of those who unlawfully, defiantly condemned Jesus Christ to death? They were all predestined by God to do it. The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ. For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together. For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done (Acts 4:26-28). So, the Bible teaches man’s personal responsibility and God’s ab- solute predestination. If God was willing to predestinate the greatest crime in history, holding the criminals fully responsible, then surely He is willing to bring to pass all the other relatively minor crimes in history, also holding each criminal responsible. God’s law touches everything, and each man is fully responsible for his thoughts and actions; he must obey the whole of God’s law. God did not create the world and then depart, leaving it to run by itself until the final judgment (textbook Deism’s god). He is pres- ent everywhere, but specially present with His people. He delivers them. But He also gives His law to them. He runs everything, yet men are made in His image, and they have the ability to understand the external world. They are responsible to God because God is totally sovereign. He has laid down the law, both moral and physi- cal. His Word governs all things. No appeal to the logic of autono- mous man (free will) can change this."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"What Is Covenant Law? 39 2. Hierarchy/Authori@/Representation “Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else. I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear” (Isa. 45:22- 23). In these verses we find four points of the covenant: sovereignty (point one), oath (point four), righteousness (point three), and hier- archy. Every knee shall bow. There is hierarchy in this world. But knees shall also bow to Israel, if Israel remains faithful to God. “Thus saith the L ORD , The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, saying, Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, there is no God” ~no other God”: New King James Ver- sion] (Isa. 45:14). Israel represents God in history, and the nations will, @_ Israel remains couenantal~ faith~l, become Israel’s bondsemants. This means that men who disobey God’s law are required to do what they are told by those officers who declare God’s law as His lawful covenantal representatives. These representatives speak in God’s name through couenantal in~titutions. There is inescapable cor- porate responsibility in history. Nations will obey God and His rep- resentatives, said Isaiah, even if their citizens must be brought to judgment in chains. In Israel, civil law was enforced hierarchically: a bottom-up ap- peals court system (Ex. 18). This is also true of church courts (Matt. 18:15-18). Thus, officers speak representative@: God’s representatives before men, and men’s representatives before God. This doctrine of representation is the basis of mankind’s corporate dominion over nature (Gen. 1:26-28). Men are under God and God’s law corporately; they are to exercise dominion corporately by bringing the whole earth under God’s law. Thus, biblical law is a tool of dominion. Hierarchical representation is also the basis of covenantal gov- ernments’ corporate responsibility before God: Church, State, and family. Collective units are given laws to enforce; God holds them responsible to Him through representatives. Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed; Egypt and Babylon were destroyed. Israel and Judah were scattered. Classical Greece and Rome fell. There is both personal and corporate responsibility before God."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"40 POLITICAL POLYTHEISM 3. Ethics/Law/Dominion “Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth sal- vation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the L ORD have created it” (Isa. 45:8). The whole cosmos is described here as being filled with righteousness. Righteousness is the basis of man’s domin- ion over the earth. But righteousness must be defined. This is what God’s law does. It establishes boundaries to our lawful actions. The tree of the knowl- edge of good and evil was “hedged in” by God’s law. Adam and Eve were not to eat from it, or as Eve properly interpreted, even touch it (Gen. 3:3). These ethical boundaries are not exclusively personal; they are also corporate. There are biblical laws given by God that are to gov- ern the actions of families, churches, and civil governments. Auton- omous man would like to think that God’s law has nothing to do with his institutions, especially civil government, but autonomous man is in rebellion. God’s law is not restrained by autonomous man’s preferred boundaries. It is not man who lawfully declares: “Fear ye not me? saith the L ORD : will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it? But this people bath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone. Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the L ORD our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the har- vest” (Jer. 5:22-24). Notice the development of God’s argument, which is in fact a cou- enant lawsuit brought against Judah by His prophet, Jeremiah. God sets boundaries to the sea, the seasons, and the harvest. The impli- cation is that He also sets legal and moral boundaries around people, both as individuals and nationally. Men are to fear this God who sets cosmic boundaries. How is this required fear to be acknowledged? The prophets answered this question over and over, generation after generation: by obeying God’s law. 4, Oath/Judgment/Sanctions “1 have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"What Is Couenant Law? 41 bow, every tongue shall swear” (Isa. 45: 23). His Word is sufficient. He will not go back on His Word. He has sworn by His own name. God has therefore taken a covenantal oath that in the future, every human knee shall bow, and every human tongue shall swear. There is no escape from God’s authority; and therefore all mouths shall swear — they shall acknowledge His sovereignty, either on earth or in the afterlife. Even in the lake of fire, they must eternally swear that God is who He says He is. God’s law is our standard, both individually and corporately. There are covenantal institutions that are bound by the revealed law of God: Church, State, and family. These are the three covenantal institutions that God has established to declare and enforce His law. All institutions must obey, but these are those that are exclusively governed by formal oaths before God. What is an oath? It is the calling down on one’s head the negative sanctions of God. If a person or covenanted institution disobeys the law of God, then God comes in wrath to punish the rebels. He comes in history. This was the warning of the Old Testament prophets. On the other hand, if men repent and obey, God is merciful and will bless them. ‘Wour iniquities have turned away these things: Jeremiah warned Judah regarding the rain and the harvest, ‘and your sins have withholden good things from you” (Jer. 5:25). The prophets came in the name of God as covenantal representatives, calling individuals, as well as representative kings and priests, to repent, to turn back to God’s law and thereby avoid God’s negative sanctions in history. The passage above all others in the Bible that describes the his- torical sanctions of God is Deuteronomy 28. Verses 1-14 describe the blessings (positive sanctions), and verses 15-68 describe the cursings (negative sanctions). Understand, these are historical sanctions. They are not appropriate sanctions for the final judgment. In this sense, they are representative sanctions of eternity’s sanctions, what Paul called the “earnest” or down payment of God in history on what must in- evitably come in eternity (Eph. 1:14). 5. Succession/Continui~/Inheritance “In the L ORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory” (Isa. 45: 25). Because God is the Creator, His people will in- herit the earth: “The earth is the L ORD ’ S , and the fulness thereofl the world, and they that dwell therein” (Ps. 24:1). (This is point one of the covenant.) Psalm 25:12-13 provides the covenantal promise:"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"42 POLITICAL POLYTHEISM What man is he that feareth the L ORD ? Him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose (v. 12). His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth (v. 13). God is to be feared (point one). God teaches man (subordina- tion: point two) the required way (point three). The man’s soul shall dwell in ease (point four), and his heirs shall inherit (point five). These two brief verses set forth God’s covenant model, and in these verses we can see the outline of God’s plan of history for covenant- keepers. This is so simple that a child can grasp it. Unfortunately, as we shall see, very few theologians have. My point is that these verses refer to history. The fear of God is historical. God’s instruction to man is historical. The law applies in history. The man is spiritually blessed in history: his soul is at ease. His heirs shall inherit. Some commentators might agree regarding the historical refer- ence of points one through three, but object to my view of point four. Perhaps the focus of the verse is exclusively internal. After all, the covenant-keeper’s soul is what is spoken of. Perhaps the blessings are not visible in history. My response is to ask a question: Why should point four — spiritual ease — be confined to only the inner person? If the inheritance is historical, then the spirit’s ease must refer to con- tentment regarding the past, present, and future. Only if the inherit- ance will be post-historical could the ease of the soul be legitimately confined to the internal realm. The covenant-keeper is at ease in his- tory because he is confident about the future success of those who share his faith. It is his seed that will inherit. If the inheritance of the whole earth is merely symbolic of the in- heritance of God’s resurrected people, then why refer to the inherit- ance delivered to a man’s seed? In eternity, this inheritance will be his, too. In short, the primary focus of the passage is on histo~, not eternity. Fear God now. Learn from God now. Obey God’s law now. Experience spiritual contentment now. Why? Because your spiritual heirs will inherit in the jhre: in time and on earth. Yet there are theologians, especially Calvinists in the Continen- tal (Dutch) tradition and all Lutherans, who insist that this prom- ised inheritance is strictly limited to the post-final judgment world of eternity. The first point — the fear of God — is historical, but personal rather than corporate. The second — being taught by God — is histor- ical, but personal rather than corporate. The third — obeying the law of God — applies in history, but is exclusive y personal, familial, and"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"What Is Covenant Law? 43 ecclesiastical — never civil. The fourth — spiritual ease — is historical but exclusively internal. Why these restrictions on the first four points? Because the fifth — inheriting the earth — is seen as exclu- sively post-historical. Summa~ The definition of pro-nomianism must begin and end with the biblical concept of the covenant. All five points of the biblical cove- nant must be included in any valid definition of biblical law. We should not expect to be able to define biblical law without first con- sidering the Bible’s primary revelation of God’s law: the structure of the various covenants God has made with men. Thus, I define “pro-nomianism” in terms of God’s covenant model: The belief that God, the sovereign, predestinating Creator, has dele- gated to mankind the responsibility of obeying His Bible-revealed law-or- der, Old and New Testaments, and promises to bless or curse men in his- tory, both individually and corporately, in terms of this law-order. This law- order and its historically applied sanctions are the basis of the progressive sanctification of covenant-keeping individuals and covenantal institutions – family, Church, and State – over time, and they are also the basis of the progressive disinheritance of covenant-breakers. This leads us to the question of the biblical definition of anti- nomianism, the antithesis of this definition. “Antinomianism” Defined We have seen that the biblical definition of God’s law is governed by the structure of God’s covenant. Thus, the biblical definition of antinomianism must also be governed by the structure of God’s cov- enant. If being an antinomian means that you are against the law, then it must also mean that it is Go&s law that you are against, and God’s law is always covenantal. To understand what antinomianism is, we can do no better than to consider the first revelation in the Bible of the original anti- nomian: Satan. Satan came to Eve with a proposition: eat of the for- bidden fruit, and you will become as God (Gen. 3:5). “Run an ex- periment, and see if this isn’t the case,” he tempted Eve. “See whose word is authoritative, mine or God’s .“ He offered her a covenantal argument, a perverse imitation of the biblical covenant:"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"44 POLITICAL POLYTHEISM 1. God is not sovereign. 2. You need not obey Him. 3. His law is not authoritative. 4. The promised negative sanction will not come. 5. [implied:] You will keep the inheritance. I choose to analyze the biblical definition of antinomianism in terms of Satan’s temptation of Eve. This line of satanic reasoning is the heart of all antinomianism. 1. Transcena%nce/Immanence Who is God? Satan was asking Eve to decide. Who lays down the law? Whose word is authoritative? Obviously, the Creator is God. Then who is the true creator, man or God? This is what Satan was asking mankind, God’s chrono- logical and judicial representative. If man answered anything but “God is the Creator, and His Word alone is authoritative,” then Satan would inherit the earth. Man would die unless, of course, God should later send His Son, the second Adam, to inherit it, but Satan chose either to ignore this possibility or to act against what he knew would happen in the future. The first step in becoming an antinomianism is to deny the abso- lute sovereignty of God. It usually begins with a denial, implicit or explicit, that God created the world. This usually begins with a soft- ening of the doctrine of the six, literal, 24-hour-day creation. This is how the seeds of Darwinism were sown: denying the literal character of God’s chronology in Genesis 1.16 The next step is to deny the obvious implication of the doctrine of creation: since God created the world, He also controls the world. In other words, men deny the absolute sovereign y of God and the providence of God. They deny the doctrine of predestination. 17 Why is a denial of predestination inherently antinomian? Be- cause it means that events in history come to pass outside of God’s decree. They are therefore random events in terms of His decree, what philosophers call contingent events. An element of contingency is thereby brought into the universe. If A takes place, B may not take 16.

It depends. On what? On something other than what God has decreed. This means that there must be gaps in historical causation. These gaps are inherently contingent with respect to the decree of God. A providential cause is separated from its eternally decreed effect. God therefore does not bring all things to pass; man brings some things to pass. The more element of contingency there is in history, the greater man’s autonomy from God’s providential control of the uni- verse. That modern science has steadily adopted chance events as the basis of modern quantum physics is not itself a random historical event. 18 This conclusion of quantum physics is the product of a hu- manistic worldview that denies any decree of God and His creation of the universe. That chaos has become the “hot new topic” of mod- ern physical science is also not random. ‘g The ethical rebellion of hu- manist man is increasing. If God does not con~rol everything that comes to pass, then His Word is not authoritative over eue~thing that comes to pass. This was the logic of Satan’s temptation: to believe that a specific cause (eating the forbidden fruit) would not ineuitab~ lead to a specific event (death). Somehow, Satan was arguing, there is contingency in this world. This is also the argument of all those who would use the concept of contingency to defend the idea of the free (semi-autonomous) will of man. This is why we are morally required to abandon any trace of the free will argument. Nevertheless, most Christians today hold to some version of the free will argument. Hence, most Christians today are in principle antinomians. 2. Hierarchy/Authon”p/Representation Satan went to Eve first. He was implying that she, not her hus- band, was sovereign. God had spoken to her husband regarding the forbidden fmit. Presumably, he had told her, as God’s representa- tive. “Obey me, not your husband,” Satan said. And by disobeying her husband, she disobeyed God. She ignored the hierarchy of au- thority over her. She ignored her representative before God: Adam. She acted autonomously. Who must man obey, God or his own autonomous mind? This was Satan’s implicit question. He asked Eve to disobey God, all in 18. Gary North, Is the Wmld Running Down?

What would happen if she dis- obeyed? Good things, he promised. “Trust me,” Satan said. ‘%&e my word for it.” In other words, “I lay down the true law.” Man thinks that he is disobeying God on his own account, in his own authority, but in fact, man must serve only one master. Ethically, he subordinates himself to Satan when he refuses to obey God. He comes under the hierarchical rule of another mas- ter. Man may think he is acting autonomously, but he in fact is sim- ply shifting masters. God or Baal? This was Elijah’s question (I Ki. 18:21). God or mammon? This was Jesus’ question (Matt. 6:24). But neither God nor Satan normally appears to an individual. Each sends human representatives. Men represent God in positions of corporate responsibility. God has established three monopolistic insti- tutions: Church, State, and family. The head of each can serve God or Satan, and those under him are sanctified (set apart) institutionally. Soldiers live or die in terms of decisions made by their superiors. Nations rise and fall in terms of the decisions of their national lead- ers. An individual’s success or failure in history cannot be discussed without reference to the institutional hierarchies above and below him, and their success or failure. Thus, to deny that God’s law ap- plies to your covenantal superior is another way of saying that it really does not apply to you. “I was just following orders!” says the subordinate who has sinned. In other words, “I was under someone else’s authority — someone other than God.” Uriah the Hittite was a righteous man. He died because he was so righteous. Unrighteous King David told unrighteous General Joab to be sure that Uriah died in battle, and Joab carried out the order (11 Sam. 12). In short, covenantal hierarchy is important. David later decided to number the people. This was against God’s law. Joab warned him about this, but David insisted, so Joab carried out the order. God’s prophet then came to David and announced one of three judgments: seven years of famine, three months of David’s fleeing before his enemies, or a three-day pestilence. Take your pick, the prophet said. David was too proud to accept the mild but person- ally humiliating second sanction, so he gave God the choice. God sent the worst one, nationally speaking: a plague that killed 70,000 people (11 Sam. 24), (Anyone who teaches that God does not send sickness to His people has a real problem in explaining this passage. ) In short, covenantal representation is important."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"What Is Covenant Law? 47 There are theologians today who say that God’s law applies only to individuals, that nations are not under God’s law. They deny the very possibility of a national covenant in New Testament times. Such a covenant was only for ancient Israel. National leaders are not representatives of their subordinates before God, theologians insist, and national leaders are surely not God’s representatives before their subordinates. God’s law has nothing to do with politics, they insist. There is no hierarchy of appeal based on God’s law. There is no na- tional covenant: this is a basic philosophy of all modern secular politi- cal theory, and few Christian scholars disagree. And those few who are willing to affirm the legitimacy of a national covenant gag on the idea of a future international covenant. International covenants are unthinkable for them. Not so for Isaiah (19:18-25).20 3. Ethics/Law/Dominion “Forget about the law against eating this fruit: Satan told Eve. ‘Go ahead and eat.” “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law,” announced the self-proclaimed early twentieth-century magician, Aleister Crowley, who also called himself the Beast and 666.21 The ethical positions are the same. The results are also the same. “We’re under grace, not law.” This is the fundamentalist Chris- tians’ version of the same ethical position. So is, “No creed but Christ, no law but love!” They do not mean what Paul meant: that Christians are no longer under the threat of the negative eternal sanc- tions of the law. They mean rather that God’s law no longer applies in any of the five aspects of the covenant, eternally or historically. Christian social thinkers, especially neo-evangelicals in the Wheaton College-InterVarsity Press- Christiani~ Today orbit, prefer to muddy the ethical waters by using fancier language than the fun- damentalists use. Examples: The fact that our Scriptures can be used to support or condemn any eco- nomic philosophy suggests that the Bible is not intended to lay out an eco- nomic plan which will apply for all times and places.

We are talk- ing about a process, not final answers. 23 There is in Scripture no blueprint of the ideal state or the ideal economy. We cannot turn to chapters of the Bible and find in them a model to copy or a plan for building the ideal biblical state and national economy. 24 “Blueprint” is the code word for biblical law for those who do not want to obey biblical law. Second, “God’s principles” is the code phrase for fundamentalists who are nervous about appearing totally antinomian, but who are equally nervous about breaking openly with the teachings and language of dispensationalism, i.e., “we’re under grace, not law.” Finally, “God’s moral law” is the code phrase for the evangelical and Reformed man who does not want to be branded an antinomian, but who also does not want to be bound by the case laws of the Old Testament. In all these cases, the speaker re- jects the idea of the continuing authority of the case laws. It all boils down to this: Satan’s rhetorical question, “Hath God said?” (Gen. 3:1). The proper response is, “Yes, God bath said!” He is the sovereign Creator. He has laid down the law. 4. Oath/Judgment/Sanctions There are two kinds of sanctions: blessings and cursings. God told Adam that in the very day he ate of the tree, he would surely die. (“Dying, you shall die”: the familiar biblical pleonasm. ) 25 This means a negative sanction in hi.stoy. Satan told Eve that she would not surely die. Instead, she would know good and evil, as God does: a positive sanction. Which would it be? “To die or not to die, that is the question.” Satan was a liar, but not so great a liar as to deny the idea of pre- dictable sanctions in history. He simply denied God’s negative sanc- 22. William Diehl, ‘The Guided-Market System,” in Robert G. Clouse (cd.), Wealth and Poverp, op. cit., p. 87. , 23.

Would that modern Christian theologians were as honest as Satan! Instead, they deny the very ex- istence of predictable covenantal sanctions in New Testament times. They write such things as: “And meanwhile it [the common grace or- der] must run its course within the uncertainties of the mutually con- ditioning principles of common grace and common curse, prosperity and adversity being experienced in a manner largely unpredictable because of the inscrutable sovereignty of the divine will that dis- penses them in mysterious ways .“26 This muddled prose matches an equally muddled concept of ethics and history. In English, this state- ment means simply that there is no ethical cause-and-efect relationshifi in post-o-uc#ixion histoy. Biblical case laws are still morally and judicially binding today. This is the thesis of Tools of Dominion. Kline’s theology explicitly denies this. Second, Kline’s argument also means the denial of God’s sanctions — blessing and cursing — in New Testament history. It is the denial of any long-term cause-and-effect relationship between covenantal faithfulness and external blessings — positive feedback between covenant-keeping and uisible blessings. It is also the denial of any long-term cause-and-effect relationship between covenantal unfaithfulness and external cursings. Thus, when I refer to “anti- nomianism,” I have in mind the hostile attitude regarding ethical cause and effect in society — social antinomianism 27 — but also a deeper and more fundamental hostility: a denial, implicit or ex- plicit, of the reliability of the covenantal promises (sanctions) of God in history. 5. Succession/Continuip/~nheritance If you die, you do not inherit. If you die without children, some- one else inherits. Who would inherit in history if Eve listened to the serpent and did what he recommended? If Satan was successful, he would inherit in history. Adam and Eve would die, as he well knew. He was a liar. He knew who is sov- ereign, whose Word is law, and who will bring negative sanctions in history: God. Satan knew that he might inherit as a subordinate 26. Meredith G.

He would thwart God’s plan. This prospect was enough to please Satan. But Satan’s hopes were shattered by the second Adam, Jesus Christ, who bore the law’s negative sanctions so that God’s adopted children (John 1:12) might inherit the earth and gain eternal life as well. Rather than seeing Satan inherit the earth through his earthly representatives, God has created an inheritance system governing hi$- toy: positive feedback for covenant-keepers and negative feedback for covenant-breakers. Notice that the question of the inheritance was clearly historical: Satan never had any possibility y of inheriting heaven. Antinomians deny the existence of this inheritance system in his- tory. This antinomian viewpoint regarding the systematic long-term outworking of God’s visible covenantal judgments in the Christian era leads directly to what F. N. Lee has termed pessimillennialism, re- ferring to both premillennialism and amillennialism. Covenant- keeping people will not progressively inherit the earth before Christ “ comes again physically, we are told. In contrast, Christian Recon- structionists affirm God’s visible sanctions in history. If there is pre- dictable long-term positive feedback (external blessings) in history for covenant-keeping, which Deuteronomy 28:1-14 insists that there is, and if there is long-term negative feedback (external cursings) in history for covenant-breaking, which Deuteronomy 28:15-68 insists that there is, then those who obey God must ineoitab~ extend their external dominion over time, while those who disobey God must in- evitab~ have external dominion removed from them. God’s sanctions in history still exist. This was John Calvin’s view,zs but modern Calvinists have abandoned it. God’s covenantal law-order inevitab$ leads to the external cultural triumph of God’s cove- nantall y faithful people. This, of course, is postmillennialism. 29 This combination of covenant sanctions in history and postmillennial 28.

To this extent, premillennialists and amillennialists have generally been so- cial antinomians. They have erred in the development of their view of God’s law and its sanctions in history. They have allowed their eschatologies of historical defeat to shape their doctrine of law, i.e., making it impotent in its historical effects. This triumph of pessimis- tic eschatological views over biblical ethics is one of the most devas- tating theological problems that the modern Church faces. Thus, antinomianism is defined as that view of life which rejects one or more of the five points of the biblical covenant as they apply to God’s revealed law in history. They deny that God, the sovereign, predestinating Creator, has delegated to mankind the responsibility of obeying His Bible-revealed law-order, Old and New Testaments, and promises to bless or curse men in history, both individually and corporately, in terms of this law-order. This law-order and its histori- cally applied sanctions are the basis of the progressive sanctification of covenant-keeping individuals and covenantal institutions — fam- ily, Church, and State – over time, and they are also the basis of the progressive disinheritance of covenant-breakers. Definitions and Paradigms Some readers may not accept my definition of antinomian, but every reader should at least understand how and why I am using the term. The biblical definition of God’s law must include all five of the points of the biblical covenant model. Deny any one of these five doctrines, and you have thereby adopted an antinomian theology. Deny them, and you necessarily must also deny the continuing au- thority of Deuteronomy 28 in the New Testament era. Yet an im- plicit and even explicit denial of these doctrines (and the relevance of Deuteronomy 28) has been a basic tactic of the vast majority of Christian theologians for over a millennium. 31 Thus, they have at- tempted to define away the case laws and historical sanctions. What I am saying is that it is theologically invalid to attempt to define 30. Postmillennial Puritans generally shared this view, which is why Reconstruc- tionists regard themselves as neo-Puritans. 31. The major exceptions were the Puritans: Journal of Christian Reconstruction, V (Winter 1978-79): “Symposium on Puritanism and Law.”"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"52 POLITICAL POLYTHEISM away the continuing authority of Deuteronomy 28. I therefore see the inescapable theological necessity of restoring the biblical defini- tion of biblical law and therefore anti-law. I fully realize that my definition of antinomian is not the accepted usage. This common usage exists primarily because theological anti- nomians who have rejected one or more of the covenant model’s five points have previously defined the word so that it conforms to their pessimistic historical outlook: the long-term cultural impotence of God’s redeemed people in history. They argue that antinomianism is merely the denial of one’s Personal responsibility to obey God’s moral law (undefined). 32 This deliberately restricted definition implicitly surrenders history to the devil. What I am saying is this: anyone who denies that there are cause-and-effect relationships in histoy between the application of biblical case laws and the success or failure of so- cial institutions has also inevitably and in Principle adopted the idea that the devil controls and will continue to control this world. Why? Because the devil’s representatives are said to be able to maintain con- trol over the social institutions of this world throughout history (point two of the covenant: representation). It does no good for a person to answer that he is not an antinomian just because he respects God’s law in his personal life, family life, and church life. He is still saying that God’s law is historically impotent in social affairs, that covenant-keeping or covenant-breaking offers rewards or curses only to individuals and only after the final judgment.

I am quite self- conscious about this task. Readers deserve to know this. One inesca- pable aspect of a new movement or new way of viewing the world is the creation of new terms (e.g., “theonomy”), and the redefining of old terms.

Those who pioneer a new worldview must break the near- monopoly stranglehold over useful terms that existing intellectual guilds have gained for themselves. An objection to my definition of the word “antinomian” simply because it does not conform precisely to past usage is also to a large extent also an objection to the alterna- tive worldview that I am proposing. 36 This implicit theological hostility is masked by an explicit appeal to supposedly neutral gram- mar. But Van Til has taught us well: nothing is neutral. “Every bit of supposedly impersonal and neutral investigation, even in the-field of science, is the product of an attitude of spiritual hostility to the Christ through whom alone there is truth in any dimension.”sT This surely includes language. As I wrote in 1973, “Neutrality does not exist. Everything must be interpreted in terms of what God has re- vealed. The humanistic goal of neutral language (and therefore neu- tral law) was overturned at the Tower of Babel.

We are preparing for this shift well in advance. Theonomy as Utopian Calvinist Ken Myers, a defender of Christian political pluralism, has taken a forthright stand against utopianism, as in utopian blue- prints for sociep. He stands foresquare for realism. (Or is it Realpolitik ?) He adopts a line of reasoning used by antinomians everywhere. He contrasts the idea of perfect standards with the real- it y of this sin-filled world, He does not do this in order to spur men on to greater perfection. He does not call on them to invoke this vi- sion of a perfect blueprint as a means of reconstructing society. On the contrary, he says that the very perfection of the blueprint may condemn it as a tool of dominion in history. “It is never enough for us to concoct notions of perfect government .“ 39 But what if God Himself has “concocted” such notions? It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect (Ps. 18:32). The law of the L ORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the L ORD is sure, making wise the simple (Ps. 19:7). Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace (Ps. 37:37). I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come un- to me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart (Ps. 101:2). Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me (Ps. 101:6). But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed (James 1:25). This line of reasoning does not impress Mr. Myers greatly. What he seems to have in mind is a specific kind of utopianism: Christian Reconstruction. Perhaps not. He maybe thinking of something that just sounds a lot like Christian Reconstruction. But note carefully 39.

If you think I regard the following paragraph as a practical reason for linking theonomy with postmillennialism, you are correct: The other variety of utopianism we must avoid might be called the lure of the “third way.” By this I mean to challenge not the motives but the con- clusions of all those who set out determined not to embrace any existing sol- ution but to invent an entirely distinct “biblical” option. Such an exercise may be useful for academic purposes, and it is possible that it may some- times be fruitful to develop a vanguard with an entirely new vision. Fur- ther, it may be the case that all existing parties or programs are so tainted with evil that they must be rejected. But sometimes we must take sides with the lesser of two evils, especially if we have reason to believe that our tenaciously holding out for the tertiwn quid will ensure that the greater of two evils will carry the day and do much greater damage. Political realism re- quires the recognition that human sin may rule out any hope that our ideal program can ever be enacted or may ensure that if it is enacted, it will have no chance of achieving the desired ends. If the best is impossible to achieve, we should know how we can promote the better. w In short, theonomy is utopian unless postmillennialism is true. This observation leads me to Mr. Barrington’s lament. Barrington’s Lament H. B. Barrington, a supporter of a Constitutional amendment to name Jesus Christ as the sovereign Lord of the United States, has protested against the “Tyler Reconstructionist” fusion of theonomy and postmillennialism. He calls it “frustrating” and a “constant irri- tant .“ What he means is that it is frustrating and irritating to those, like himself, who have a slightly different agenda for Church reform and national reform, and who have a more traditional constituency. The question is: Why should someone who does not share our theo- logical agenda complain if our eschatology interferes with his agenda, especially since he is using our materials and arguments to promote his agenda? Why not just rest content with the fact that each side can pursue its separate though closely related agendas, cooperating on an ad hoc basis whenever possible? Christians already do this in the battle against abortion. Why not also in the battle to impose a na- 40.

He insists, regarding postmillennialism, that “This doctrine is unnecessary for theonomic thinking, and yet it is tenaciously held by the theonomists whom I know as though their position would collapse if they did not strongly espouse this eschato- logical position.”41 For some very logical theonomists, this link is not logically neces- sary — and therefore not theologically necessary; Greg Bahnsen is one example. He, too, finds that any assertion of an inescapable cove- nantal link between biblical law and postmillennial eschatology an irritant. 42 But for those of us who have adopted the five-point cove- nant model presented by Sutton — which Dr. Bahnsen goes out of his way to repudiates — the link is fundamental, for we proclaim the continuing validity of the Deuteronomic sanctions in New Covenant history. Those who are faithful will be blessed; eventually (i.e., in- evitably) they gain institutional power, even if this takes many gen- erations. Those who are rebellious will eventually lose power. Bless- ing and cursing in history: this two-fold aspect of point four of the covenant forces us to become postmillennialists. Why should men believe that there can be eschatological neutral- ity? There i~ no neutrality. I keep writing this italicized sentence throughout this book. Some people will get tired of it, but it needs constant repetition. Christians keep saying that they agree with this principle, yet when they get to one or another issue, they abandon it. Whenever they do, Christianity loses ground. For us “Tyler Recon- structionists” to adopt eschatological neutrality would be the equiva- lent of our adopting neutrality on the question of predestination vs. free will, or God’s law vs. natural law. We are selling a covenantal package deal. It comes as a unit; you can toss out any part that you do not like, but you must pay for the whole package. 41. H. B.

He refers to it as “the artificial imposition of an imagined blanket outline (with imprecise, pre-established categories).” Ibid., p. 247n. I suspect that Dr. Bahn- sen is reacting against this five-point outline because an early version of it was first promoted in Calvinist circles by Dr. Meredith Kline, whose approach to hermeneu- tics, not to mention biblicaJ law, is not on Dr. Bahnsen’s list of recommended strategies. His instinctive reaction is that if Kline promotes it, it, has to be wrong.

There are also those who love what we are saying about eschatology, but who are very upset about “all this legalistic business about Old Testament law.” People want to only buy part of our theological package, and they are offended or at least greatly disturbed by one or another fea- ture that they regard as excess baggage. Each group pleads: “Drop the part which offends us, and all will be well with the program.” They mean, “All will be well with our program.” Mr. Barrington lit- erally says that this is the tactical problem he faces in recruiting to theonomy people who remain committed to other eschatological views (amillennialism, I am willing to bet). 44 But what if I dropped predestination to satisfy the charismatic “buyers”? Mr. Barrington would regard this as a disastrous sell-out, as indeed it would be. If I refuse to capitulate to the theological suggestions of Arminians, whose number is legion, I am also unlikely to capitulate for the sake of all those amillennialist Calvinists who are presently committed to amending the Constitution to include a Christian statement of faith, whose number is considerably less than legion. So, in order to alienate everyone equally, I now respond: “No, gentlemen, it is your responsibility before God to teach what the Bible teaches, and the Bible teaches covenantal postmillennialism. It is not our responsibility to change our confession in order to meet the silent standards of institutionally convenient neutralit y; it is your re- sponsibility to change your various confessions .“ You know all about Christian Reconstructionists: a highly confi- dent bunch. Being postmillennialists, we expect everyone else to adopt our view; even more than this, we predict that as time passes, just about all Christians will! 45 We believe in continuity. We believe 44. Ibid., p. 71. 45. The historic Christian creeds either do not discuss eschatology, or else estab- lish eschatological tolerance within the Church. The historic creeds are wrong on this point. They have not been based on the biblical doctrine of the covenant. They do not take seriously the covenant sanctions in history. While we five-point covenan- talists can maintain peaceful relations with those fellow churchmen who do not share our eschatology, we are confident that over time, biblical preaching will change men’s minds on eschatology. If nothing else, when Christianity is triumphant over all the earth, Christians will then hasten to rewrite the creeds to reflect this fact. My view is simple: creeds can be changed as surely as constitutions can be. We need na- tional covenants; we also need an international covenant. North, Healer of tlu Naiwns.

It is not sufficient to restructure only one part of the U.S. Constitu- tion and leave the rest of it in its present form. It is not enough to make Jesus Christ its Lord without making the Bible the final stan- dard of all court appeals. God is not impressed with a formal com- mitment to Him without public obedience to His revealed civil law and the enforcement of His required civil sanctions. This book is a lengthy refutation of those covenant theologians and scholars who have failed to preach all five points. This halfway house covenant theology is guaranteed to fail. It is also not enough to preach obedience without also preaching victory. The sanctions of God – inheritance and disinheritance – are part of His covenant. This is what Jeremiah fully understood and what the modern Church has not understood. This is what Jerusalem also forgot. Lamenting over the destruction of Jerusalem, Jeremiah said: “Her uncleanness is in her skirts; She did not consider her destiny; there- fore her collapse was awesome; she had no comforter” (Lam. l:9b; New King James). (The American Standard Version reads: “she did not consider her future .“) In short, Jerusalem forgot about God’s covenant sanctions. She forgot about biblical eschatology. So do most theologians and churches today. They think they are defending bibli- cal esehatology; they are not. This will change over time; a mark of eschatological and ethical progress over time will be this shift in eschatology toward an acceptance of God’s covenant sanctions in history. Those who are faithful to God’s external laws will prosper externally in the long run; those who are disobedient will not. The extension of civic righteousness over time is inevitable. Until that final day of rebellion, even unbelievers will be sufficiently pragmatic to obey God’s civil laws. 46 46.

This is an application of part four of the five-point covenant model which “Tyler Reconstructionism” preaches. 47 The law of God and the cultural victory of God’s people in history are linked. If Calvinistic amillennialists refuse to go along with God’s five-point covenant model, we in Tyler are not responsible. We preach the whole covenant, not just one or two parts of it. It is as mistaken to preach the covenantal obedience of God’s people without any eschatological necessity of their cultural victory in history (Bahnsen) as it is to preach the inevitability of cultural de- feat of God’s people in history despite their covenantal faithfulness (amillennialism). These two positions are linked by their rejection of the doctrine of God’s dual sanctions in history. That Dr. Bahnsen and Mr. Barrington commiserate together regarding the “irritant” of Tyler’s linking together of ethics and eschatology through the doc- trine of God’s dual sanctions should therefore not be surprising to anyone. The concept of the inevitability y of God’s dual sanctions in cultural history was rejected by Van Til, too, and also by Meredith Kline, as well as by dispensationalism, Dutch Calvinism, Lutheran- ism, and the whole of modern evangelicalism. The fact that very few theologians today are willing to break with what has been the deeply rooted belief of the mainstream of Protestant Christianity for over three centuries is to be taken for granted. Paradigm shifts always start outside the mainstream. Conclusion I have offered a comprehensive view of what the pro-nomian posi- tion teaches that biblical law is. We see biblical law as an integrated, unbreakable whole, an explicitly covenantal system of biblically revealed law. Antinomianism is a denial of this integrated system, yet in 47. For reasons of one sort or other, a few of the pioneering Reconstructionist authors refuse to go along with the five-point covenant model, but the power of a thoroughly biblical model will eventually overcome opposition from younger schol- ars who do not have personal or intellectual stakes in the six loci of Protestant scho- lasticism. Covenant theology has faced a shrinking market for over three centuries, in part because of its commitment to a structure imposed on it by the logical catego- ries of Protestant scholasticism. This shrinking process is unlikely to be reversed soon if covenant theologians persist in structuring their theological discussions in terms of these earlier loci which, while not individually unbiblical, are not derived as a unit from any biblical text, unlike the five-point covenant model, which is found throughout the Bible."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"60 POLITICAL POLYTHEISM many cases, it offers as an alternative a perverse mirror image of this system. Satan had to use the biblical covenant model in order to refute it. He thereby honored the old political principle: “You can’t beat something with nothing.” The older definitions of “antinomian” were devised by those who, if my version of God’s law is correct, were themselves antinomians. They did not adhere to all five points of the biblical covenant model. They may or may not have denied all five points, but they refused to affirm all five points, and then derived their definition of law and anti-law in terms of all five points. So, for the sake of clarity, let me repeat my compact definition of pro-nomianism: The belief that God, the sovereign, predestinating Creator, has dele- gated to mankind the responsibility of obeying His Bible-revealed law-order, Old and New Testaments, and promises to bless or curse men in history, both individually and corporately, in terms of this law-order. This law- order and its historically applied sanctions are the basis of the progressive sanctification of covenant-keeping individuals and covenantal institutions — family, Church, and State – over time, and they are also the basis of the progressive disinheritance of covenant-breakers.

Having the religion of the city, he might claim rights under its laws, and perform all the ceremonies of legal procedure. The stranger, on the contrary, having no part in the religion, had none in the law. If he entered the sacred enclosure which the priests had traced for the assembly, he was punished with death. The laws of the city did not exist for him. If he had committed a crime, he was treated as a slave, and punished without process of law, the city owing him no legal protection.

It is the dissertation which they have been taught from their youth in public schools, Baptist schools, Catholic schools (in the United States, anyway), and maybe even home schools. This familiar message has been proclaimed by the pulpits of the land. It would go something like this: “Look here, sir, we know you mean well. We appreciate your en- thusiasm and life-long dedication to evangelism. You no doubt have God’s interests at heart, as you understand them. But you have set an “either/or” choice before us. You apparently do not recognize the complexity of the political situation we face today. While we no doubt all believe in God in our personal lives, just as you do, we are nevertheless not legally in a position to enforce our personal views on others.

Not simply a conspiracy of silence, which today unquestion- ably exists, but a self-conscious, deeply religious, highly intellectual, well-organized political conspiracy which gained a major victory over Christian civilization almost exactly two centuries ago. This conspiracy had previously been working for about a century to achieve this major victory. We do not call it a conspiracy because it won. A successful conspiracy is like successful treason, as described by John Barrington in 1613: Treason cloth never prosper: what’s the reason? Why if it prosper, none dare call it treason. Political Po&theism is an attempt to overcome this contemporary conspiracy of silence. It is aIso a preliminary step in overcoming the political results of the three-centuries-old original conspiracy. My hope is that the spiritual and political heirs of this conspiracy will take little notice of this fat book until it is way too late for them to do much about it. This is one reason why I made it so fat. I hope those outside the Reconstructionists’ paradigm shift will decide not to read it until after the shift.

Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness. Let thy mercies come also unto me, O L ORD , even thy salvation, according to thy word.

That next-to-the last verse is crucial: “And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.” The psalmist understood the fundamental biblical legal principle: selj-gouernrnent under Go$s revealed law is the starting point for liberp. Because he was formally under God’s revealed law, and because he had memorized it and was progressively bring- ing his actions into conformity with it, day by day, he could say in confidence, “I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.” Outside of Israel – and inside, whenever evil ruled the land through false priests and civil tyrants – there were only varying degrees of spiritual darkness and political oppression. These always go together: spiritual darkness and political oppression. Psalm 82 describes the plight of those under the reign of such darkness: God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.

He judged among the gods, meaning among human judges. 3 Verse 6 reminds the people: “I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.” This is meant in the same sense as “gods” in Exodus 3.

People outside the land of Israel who sought civil justice and lib- erty had a way to gain it: to go to Israel and live as resident aliens under God’s law. God told the Israelites at the time of the Exodus that they would be required to treat all residents the same. There was to be only one civil law for all residents. “One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you” (Ex. 12:49). The gates of Israel were always open to those who would agree to live under God’s civil law. A stranger who was willing to subject himself to the external, civil laws of God was entitled to all the external covenantal blessings thereof. 4 Israel served as the Church in the ancient world. The New Testament speaks of Israel as the Church. “This is he [Moses], that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us” (Acts 7:38). Because of this, Israel had an open-door pol- icy. As surely as the Church’s doors are open today to all those living in spiritual darkness, so were Israel’s gates open. As surely as the 4. Cf.

But there is an important though neglected implication of this analogy: as surely as the non-member is not allowed to vote in a church election, or serve as an elder in a church, so was the stranger in the gates forbidden to serve as a civil judge in Israel. Why? Because those who were notformally and voluntarily under the eternal couenant sanctions of God— not ~“ust the external sanctions — were not allowed to exercise temporal civil~”udgment. s You had to become a church member in Israel in or- der to become a civil judge.G If you were not voluntarily under God’s eternal sanctions, you were not allowed to impose God’s negative civil sanctions. Sanctions: here is that “sanct” root again. What are sanctions? They are blessings or curses on those who either obey or disobey the law.7 Those who obey God’s law are set apart from those who do not obey. They are set apart by means of God’s blessings. Those who disobey are also set apart from those who obey; in this case, by means of the curses. Covenant sanctions are applied lawfully by three (and only three) institutions: State, Church, and family. The key to under- standing a covenant is the presence of an oath. One must swear allegiance to a covenant. Only these three organizations are author- ized by God to require such oaths. When a man swears allegiance publicly to the civil government, he is allowed to become a citizen. When a man swears allegiance to a particular church, he is allowed to become a member. When a man swears allegiance to a woman, and she swears allegiance to him, he is allowed to become her hus- 5. That the Israelites did understand the eternal nature’ of the covenant’s sanc- tions is made clear in Daniel 12:1-3: “And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and-they that turn many” to righteous- ness as the stars for ever and ever.” 6. Why didn’t a man have to become a member of the congregation in order to get married and thereby become the judge of a household? Because the command given by God to mankind regarding subduing of the earth constituted a universal familistic covenant, irrespective of formal theological confession (Gen. 1:26-28; 2:23-24). 7.

Civil J&ges: Bound by Two Covenants A stranger within the gates was not allowed to become a civil judge until He swore formal, public allegiance to God. He had to be circumcised and become a member of the ecclesiastical congrega- tion. This demonstrated that he acknowledged that he was under God’s eternal covenant.8 He had two separate sets of@iges over him: eccle- siastical and civil. There was therefore a legal process of ‘natu- ralization” in Israel: circumcision. Actually, we can better under- stand this as a procedure for “de-naturalization”; the natural man re- ceives not the things of the Spirit (I Cor. 2:14). He would come for- mall y under God’s eternal sanctions (which a resident alien was not, formally); he could now become a civil judge and exercise temporal civil judgments under God. He was voluntarily, formally, and offi- cially under God’s eternal maledictoy oath; he could therefore lawfully bring others under the negative temporal sanctions of God’s civil law if he became a civil judge. The office of civil judge was now legally open to him. Today, every Christian understands this principle in reference to church membership: no formal subordination under God% eternal authority, so no temporal authority within the congregation. But hardly anyone under- stands this same principle with respect to God’s civil government. Israel could serve as a sanctuary for the pagan strangers of the ancient world precisely because no stranger could enforce civil sanc- tions inside Israel. Had strangers within the gates been allowed to exercise civil judgment, their covenantal commitment to their for- eign gods would eventually have colored their official judgments. There is no religious or~udicial neutrality. The office of civil judge would then have become a much-valued prize, a means of subversion for for- eign gods and foreign nations. Israel would have been judicially open to foreign conquest from within. Every stranger within the gates would have been regarded as a potential spy or enemy agent.

For ex- ample, a police officer can lawfully break down the door of a house if he has reason to believe that a husband inside is strangling his wife, but this is still a protection of the home. The husband has broken the covenant judicially by strangling his wife.

The question we need to answer biblically – and I stress the word bib~ical~ – is this: Is this still the case today? If not, why not? Civil Rights us. Political Rights God’s law has established the foundational principle of all civil rights: one civil law code for all residents. Not just one law for all citizen~ one law for all residents. This is what distinguished ancient Israel from all other pagan societies. Pagan societies did not give non-citizens full legal access to their civil courts. Strangers therefore had no civil rights. This was as true in Greece and Rome as elsewhere. 14 In Israel, everyone had equal access to the civil courts, for every- one was under the same civil law. This was the basis of the psalmist’s confidence: “I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed” (Ps. 119:46). But the concomitant to this ex- traordinary civil liberty was political discrimination: the resident alien could not vote or serve” as a civil judge. The maintenance of civil lib- erty was not possible in a world in which resident aliens could exer- cise citizenship apart from taking God’s covenant oaths, civil and ec- clesiastical, especially ecclesiastical. It was a man’s public affirma- tion of God’s eternal sanctions that established his legitimate access to bear the sword. Every society understands that citizenship requires an oath. Every society screens access to the voting booth and political office on the basis of an oath. The question is: To whom is the oath made? To God or to some other authority? The humanist says that the oath must be taken to the State or the People or the Constitution — all man-made deities. The Bible says that the oath must be taken to God, and that this oath must call down on the oath-taker eternal as well as temporal sanctions. Only the Church of Jesus Christ has the God-given authority to- day to announce the application of God’s eternal sanctions in the New Covenant era (Matt. 18:18). Therein lies the rub for humanism and all other rival religions. Therein also lies the rub for every Christian who seeks to defend the doctrine of political pluralism. 14.

They all have restrictive immigration barriers. This is a recent development, a political product of World War I and the decade following (1914-24). Prior to 1914, there were no passports in the modern sense. Physically healthy people could cross national borders permanently without significant legal interference. The llth edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, published in 1911, begins its brief section on “Passport” as follows: “PASSPORT, or safe conduct in time of war, a document granted by a belligerent power to protect persons and property from the operation of hostilities.” The idea of a passport was the protection of individuals of one nation from bureaucrats of another. “In its more familiar sense a passport is a document authorizing a person to pass out of or into a country, or a Iicence or safe-conduct to the person specified therein and authenticating his right to aid and protection. Although most foreign countries may now be entered without pass- ports, the English foreign office recommends travelers to furnish themselves with them, as affording a ready means of identification in case of need.” Most people today can barely imagine such a world. Today, passports are universally required as a means of control over travelers from abroad. They are used to track the movements of travelers, foreign and domestic. (They are now computerized in the United States.) Passports exist for the sake of the bureaucrats, not citizens. We need to ask ourselves: What happened to the Old Testa- ment concept of sanctuary, which Western nations, especially Eng- land, Holland, the United States, and Switzerland, is scrupulously honored before World War I? What happened was that mass democracy had a head-on colli- sion with cheap mass transportation. The almost destitute and the homeless of the world can now afford to seek sanctuary in a geo- graphically distant land of plenty. And so the gates were closed by legislation, nation by nation. 16 Citizenship today is by birth in some nations; if you are a resident alien, your children will automatically y become citizens. Thus, to keep from getting politically “swamped” by the children of strangers, these nations have closed their gates. In other nations, citizenship comes with property ownership. So, the 15.

The selec- tive barriers remain. Immigration was not a political problem for ancient Israel. It was not physical birth that entitled a person to citizenship. It was rather the physical mark of a covenant oath, circumcision: the out- ward sign of the new birth. 17 Thus, we reach a most important conclusion: Israel was a sanc- tuaV because Israel was God?s theocracy. There are no remaining national sanctuaries today because citizenship and rulership are based now on mass democracy. The State 18 is officially a covenant institution established by man rather than God. It derives its authority solely from the sovereign People. This is why in some Communist dictator- ships and other dictatorships, it is against the law to refuse to vote on election day. The People must speak, even in one-party dictator- ships. The public approval of the People is the source of the regime’s legitimacy. This crucial shift in the covenantal basis of citizenship is what the conspiracy of silence is all about. This is what the political con- spiracy two centuries ago was all about. The conspirators have sub- stituted new oaths, and Christian citizens have naively agreed to this, thereby sealing the doom of national sanctuaries in the twenti- eth century. 19 Do you now understand the Old Covenant concept of sanctuary? Do you basically approve of the concept? Do you see why it was that without a biblical theocracy based on public oaths to God there could have been no Old Covenant biblical sanctuary? What was the nature of this theocracy? Political recognition of the principle of pub- lic covenant oaths that call down covenant sanctions – external (tem- poral, civil) and eternal – under God’s covenant law. Do you think there is anything in the New Testament that has significantly altered this judicial principle? If so, how? Think about it. And then read on. 17. The reason why women did not normally exercise civil office in ancient Israel was that they were not circumcised. They could serve as judges only through their husbands, or because of their late husbands in the case of widows. Widows, as heads of households, could take independent vows (Deut. 30:9). Because females are bap- tized, this judicial restriction no longer applies in the New Covenant era. 18. I capitalize State when I refer to civil government in general.

The stranger was allowed to worship foreign gods in the privacy of his household in Old Covenant Israel. The State did not invade his home, although he could not proselytize publicly for his god or gods. 20 These household idols were fhkse gods. They represented demons who were sources of spiritual bondage and therefore poten- tial oppression. This is why the stranger had no political rights at all, meaning rights associated with the exercise of the franchise — voting – because voting is inescapably an aspect of civil rulership or judge- ship. The voter brings sanctions against the rulers. To grant the stranger political rights apart from his public rejection of his foreign gods was inevitably to grant those gods a degree of civil authority in the land. There is no neutrali~. The stranger would seek to impose different laws because he worshiped a different god.

Unfortunately, this means millions of them. The Politics of Po@heism Christians today are in bondage.

Christians do not understand this principle because they have been taught by strangers — the public school system, tele- vision, and the media in general — and also by the strangers’ certified academic agents within the household of faith. 21 The stranger within the gates was always a threat to Israel dur- ing times of apostasy. When the nation of Israel forgot God, the sign of this covenantal rebellion was the people’s abandonment of God’s revealed law. This opened the door either to conquest by foreign na- tions or conquest from within. Biblical law was Israel’s tool of do- minion; the enforcement of God’s law by Church, State, and family was the public manifestation of the society’s covenantal faithfulness to God. 22 Whenever the n-ation abandoned God’s law, His negative sanctions of defeat and slavery threatened the whole society. There is one God, and only one God, and He demanded unquestioned loyalty from His people. No other god could lawfully be publicly wor- shipped in Israel. In contrast to this biblical worldview stood ancient polytheism, most notably (for the history of the West) the polytheism of Greece and Rome. The foundation of classical political order was the belief that there can be political covenants among clans and alliances be- tween cities on the basis of shared gods and shared sacrifices. Only by inventing gods that could be honored ritually by several clans – each with its own family deities — could the classical City-State be- come a reality. Shared sacrificial rites created a common political or- der. The pantheon of the city’s gods was the public manifestation of the religion of the city. These agreed-upon gods were political. They were not the real gods of the classical world. The real gods of the classical world were demons. The Greeks lived in terror of these supernatural entities. 23 l 21. See Chapter 5, below. 22.

In the Emperor was the personifica- tion of the divine State. 26 Rushdoony has summarized the implica- tions for the Church of this development: The conflict of Christianity with Rome was thus political from the Roman perspective, although religious from the Christian perspective. The Christians were never asked to worship Rome’s pagan gods; they were merely asked to recognize the religious primacy of the state. . . . The issue, then, was this: should the empero~s law, state law, govern both the state and the church, or were both state and church, emperor and bishop alike, under God’s law? Who represented true and ultimate order, God or Rome, eternity or time? The Roman answer was Rome and time, and hence Christianity constituted a treasonable faith and a menace to political order. The Roman answer to the problem of man was political, not religious. This meant, first, that man’s bmic problem was not sin but lack of political order. This Rome sought to supply, religiously and earnestly. Second, Rome answered the problem of the one and the many in favor of oneness, the unity of all things in terms of the state, Rome.

Rome opened its pantheon of gods to the local deities of all its conquered territory. The Empire itself was the sole source of unity, not the local gods. Politics would henceforth supply the needed unity of man. The response of classical political philosophers, like most other citizens, was to invoke one of two religions, both of which are inesca- pable for humanism: the power religion and the escape religion. 28 Sheldon Wolin has described this dual development: Confronted with power, one impulse of political philosophy was to flee and seek refuge in a “golden age” located somewhere in the prepolitical past. In numerous writers we find this idea, but the significant point is that they pic- tured mankind in a society that had been purged of all political marks: neither law, coercion, property nor conflict had existed in the state of politi- cal innocence. Another and far stronger impulse, but one that was equally apolitical, was to suffuse power with religious symbols and imagery. Not the naturalism of a Polybius but a supernaturalistic view of power was domi- nant throughout much of the Hellenistic period and again in the centuries following the establishment of the Augustan Principate. This was a certain sign that men had come to look towards the political regime for something over and above their material and intellectual needs, something akin to sal- vation. If men could not flee from power to the golden age or to the univer- sal city of reason, they would interpret it differently, treating it as the saving force that sustained the political world. As far back as Hellenistic times, the theories of kingship had revealed a trend in which the ruler stood as the symbol of the fears and yearnings of the politically disinherited. In the writ- ings of the period, the other elements of a political theory receded to the background and the ruler stood alone and remote. The fate of the body pol- itic was resigned to the moral character and foresight of its governing head. He was the sole instrument of the divine logos, of that saving force which, by his mediation, could regenerate society and its members; he alone could rid the world of conflicts and make it a replica of the divine homonoia; he must, therefore, be worshiped by the names of Savior, God Manifest, Benefac- tor, and Creator. zg In short, the Hellenistic world had already begun its journey down the road back to Egypt.

The Roman Emperor was, theologically speaking, like Alexander: the Pharaoh reincarnate. The culmination of classical politics came with the Emperor Gaius Caligula (37-41), less than a decade after the crucifixion of Jesus. He had probably been the instigator of the assassination of his predecessor Tiberius by the prefect of the praetorian guards. After eight months in office, he became very ill; upon recovering, he re- vealed traces of madness. He proclaimed himself a literal god and demanded ritual sacrifice, the first Emperor to do so, though not the last. He bestowed both the priesthood and a consulship on his horse, presumably to show his contempt for representative institutions. He raised taxes and executed wealthy people who resisted, confiscating their property. He announced that he wished that the whole Roman populace had one head, so that he could cut it off with one stroke. 31 Yet he also tried to promote popular elections, without success. 32 He could not be removed from office politically. He too, of course, could be assassinated.

He couldn’t; the praetorians assassinated him in A. D. 41.

One last brief attempt to re-establish the old order was made by Julian the Apostate in 361-63, who attempted to substitute the religion of the sun god for the religion of God the Son, but he failed.4’J This grim political tradition was basic to the legacy of the classical world to the West. 41 From the collapse of pagan Rome until the Renaissance, this political-theological aspect of the classical legacy was repudiated by the Christian West. This is not to say that Christianity rejected pre-Imperial classical political philosophy. The seeming logical autonomy of classical political philosophy was both captivating and misleading; it led early Christian thinkers to con- clude that the Polis had not been the ritual-based association that it had been. The universalist of Stoic natural rights philosophy– which had been a desperate counter-move by nonpolitical Hellen- istic scholars in the face of the disintegration of the Polis4z — also seemed to have found legitimate expression in the universal Church. Thus, Christians adopted some features of classical thought, espe- cially the natural rights theories of the later Stoics. But Christian thinkers re-worked this tradition. Piety and impiety had been topics for classical political philosophers, but heresy had not been .43 The rise of Christianity had radically altered this non-creedal aspect of classical political philosophy. What men believe about God became an important aspect of citizenship. Modern Po@heism With the self-conscious revival of classical thought during the Renaissance came a revival of classical political theory, though of course modified by the cultural defeat of pagan idolatry during the Middle Ages. Supernatural elements of classical thought were removed. Machiavelli (1469-1527) is the familiar example, especially in The Discourses.

He thus enabled man more easily to reach it. By liberating man from considerations of otherworldly perfection, he gave him expanded estimations of his own power as well as enlarged expec- tations for his own estate. No longer having to look up so high, man ac- quired a new dignity in his own eyes: he became not only lord of himself and his own destiny in the moral and political sphere, but was now free to become lord of nature itself. . . .

M Machiavelli’s classical political legacy is still honored today. Modern men are too sophisticated to erect a civic pantheon of local or regional gods. Men today have lost faith in the idolatrous poly- theism of the ancient world. They have substituted instead a new polytheism, the po~theism of original~ autonomous individual men. The family of man is the presupposition of this new polytheism – every man his own autonomous god. Seventeenth- and eighteenth-century political theory asserted that these “gods” came together at some time in the mythical past — hypothetical history 47 — in order to transfer some of their sovereign y to a common civil government. This trans- fer, in fact, created civil government. Such a view of civil govern- ment is polytheism stripped of its supernatural element, but polytheism nonetheless. This is the contract (compact) theory of the State, 48 a view still popular at the time of the American Constitutional conven- tion, which was regarded by its defenders as at least analogous to the compact theory of the State. Rushdoony has stated the problem of modern politics as well as anyone has: “Modern political orders are polytheistic imperial states, but the churches are not much better.

He said: “Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven. Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. And a man’s foes shall be they of his own household” (Matt. 10:32-36). If the bloodline family itself has been broken by Christ’s gospel, what legitimate hope can men have in the political unification of the fam- ily of man on any basis other than the complete triumph of the gos- pel in history or its utter defeat? For as long as there are churches still meeting, there cannot be a rebuilt Tower of Babel. Therefore, those who wish to worship at the Tower will seek to destroy the churches. Paul announced to the Athenians regarding God as Creator: “And bath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and bath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation” (Acts 17:27). There is indeed a common humanity, but this humanity is fallen — from physical birth, man is in rebellion against God. This common existence is not suffi- cient to bring political unity, for at the Tower of Babel, man’s “lip” — his common God-denying, man-affirming confession – was forever shattered. But still we find that God-denying, man-affirming men seek to reconstruct that Tower and restore the lost unity of the soci- et y of Satan. w Reconstruction is therefore an inescapable concept.

Humanism makes this arena the most prominent one, not Christianity. Salvation by politics is a hu- manist myth. As the kingdom of humanism has extended over the face of the earth, political conflicts have escalated. The twentieth century has been the age of mass warfare and the age of politics. 52 These two facts are not randomly connected. Christian political theory asks this question: Who is authorized to speak for God in civil government? Also: On what judicial basis is this spokesman so authorized? Someone must speak the Word of God in judgment in civil government, just as in church government and family government. If God’s judgmental Word is not spoken, then man’s judgmental word will be. The question is: Can there be a per- manent political arrangement in history in which God’s Word and man’s word are spoken together? This is the fundamental question answered by political plural- ism. It answersyes. How can Christians legitimately also answeryes? Problems With Political Pluralism There are many problems with the modern philosophy of politi- cal pluralism. Permit me to list five of them. 1. Political pluralism is founded on a lie, namely, that all political issues are not at bottom religious. Political pluralists refuse to admit that tempor- ary religious and cultural cease-fires are not permanent peace treaties. At best, pluralism masks the escalating historical conflicts only for a season. 2. Political pluralism is ultimately based on polytheism: many moralities, many gods, many gods. It ignores the fact that every god offers a covenant to men, and each insists that men submit to its terms. The terms vary, god to god. 3. Under political pluralism, we eventually get civil wars anyway. One side sees its covenant as the covenant of life, and its rival’s covenant as a covenant with death. 51.

The ideology of political pluralism leads straight to government- financed education based on a politically announced set of “common civic virtues ,“ a set of virtues which is now and always has been a self-conscious program to destroy Christian education. 53 5. Public “neutral” education soon leads to increasing pressure for academic accreditation — primary, secondary, colleges, and universities — by humanists, leading directly to the destruction of systematically Christian formal education. Political pluralism is the reigning political myth of our era. It rests squarely on the doctrine of the sovereignty of autonomous man, an eighteenth-century analogue of the divine right of kings. 54 The divine-rights doctrine claims that there is no judicial appeal in his- tory beyond the designated sovereign agent: bishop, king, or people. Men can find peace only by submitting to this divine agent or by revolting against it and replacing it with a new authority. Key questions inevitably arise: Who speaks for this sovereign agent in history? Who enforces his will? What if the sovereign agent is itself divided? How is his will then discovered? In short, what is modern political pluralism if not an attempt to reconstruct the Tower of Babel? How can men find peace in history if there is perpetual war within the Tower? Christians have almost universally adopted the philosophy of political pluralism in our day. Like all pluralists, they have refused to face these questions courageously. They pretend that they can defer answering them indefinitely. They seek peace, and when they do not find it, they announce it anyway. “Peace, Peace” Like the humanist scholar Erasmus of Rotterdam, political pluralists seek peace and quiet from religiously irreconcilable con- flicts in intellectual and institutional life. They presume that if rea- sonable men will simply leave dogmatic religion out of the dis- cussion, they can come to a workable agreement. The humanists of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries called on civilization’s warring combatants to calm down, have a little non-communion wine, and 53. R. J.

Their spiritual heirs today believe that the philosophical wars of civiliza- tion are not much different in principle from the personal conflicts of the college’s faculty lounge. These people conveniently forget that access to the faculty lounge has been systematically screened for many decades in order to remove or isolate all those who might cause epistemological dissention. Those trapped in the unaccredited or untenured ‘outer darkness” are not considered to be part of the accepted universe of academic discourse. And so, in this sense, the faculty lounge really is the civil order writ small: no one worries too much about the plight of those who failed to gain authorized access. In pluralism, there is always some group “beyond the pale.” There is always someone locked out of the voting booth because of what he believes or where he lives. Irreconcilable Coniict The pluralist is unwilling to admit publicly one of the fundamen- tal principles of the Bible: there is an irreconcilable conflict in history and in all of man’s institutions between God and Satan, covenant- keepers and covenant-breakers, spiritual light and spiritual dark- ness. Paul made this principle clear when speaking of the voluntary covenantal institutions of Church and family. Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellow- ship bath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion bath light with darkness? And what concord bath Christ with Belial? or what part bath he that believeth with an infidel? And what agreement bath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God bath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty (II Cor. 6:14-18). This same principle applies to the civil covenant. Christians are not to be unequally yoked with non-Christians. There is only one way to achieve this goal: withdrawal from politics. Th~ question is: Who should withdraw, covenant-keepers or covenant-breakers? Pietists answer that covenant-keepers should withdraw; biblical theocrats insist that covenant-breakers should withdraw. One side or"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Sanctua~ and Sugj%age 87 the other must eventually exclude its rival. (Political pluralists argue that both groups can make a permanent political covenant.) The long- term goal of Christians in politics should be to gain exclusive control over the franchise. Those who refuse to submit publicly to the eter- nal sanctions of God by submitting to His Church’s public marks of the covenant – baptism and holy communion – must be denied citi- zenship, just as they were in ancient Israel. The way to achieve this political goal is through successful mass evangelism followed by con- stitutional revision. The Question of Political Participation This political question for Christians is: How much political par- ticipation, and why? One common line of reasoning is that Chris- tians are to be “salt and light” in society. This position generally in- volves a call to limited participation. Not much can be done to heal the situation, but if we can do something positive, we should. This is the outlook of “politics as a rescue mission.” Another approach is to appeal to the metaphor of the leaven. “Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened” (Matt. 13:33). If based on the principle of leaven, then the appropriate Christian approach to poli- tics would be to adopt the strategy of steady replacement of evil with good. 55 Paul made it clear: there can be no permanent covenantal reconciliation between the Christian and the non-Christian. One or the other must forsake his covenant vows. 56 This has to apply to the civil covenant, for it is one of God’s three designated covenantal in- stitutions. The leaven of righteousness fills the political arena and thereby replaces the leaven of unrighteousness. Replacement is the goal, not long-term co-operation. This is why modern Christian so- cial theorists are unlikely to adopt the metaphor of leaven. It is the one I use, however. 55. It is preposterous to argue, as dispensationalists do, that leaven in the Bible is always associated with evil. What about the Old Covenant peace offering? “Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanks- giving of his peace offerings” (Lev. 7:13), What about the Old Covenant firstfruits offering at Pentecost (yes, Pentecost)? ‘Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven: thev are the firstfruits unto the L ORD ” (Lev. 23:17). ,, 56. There can be a cease-fire, as in the case of the believing spouse who remains with the unbelieving spouse. But remember: Christians are not voluntarily to enter into such permanent covenants with non-Christians; it only is supposed to exist when one spouse is converted to Christ after the marriage."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"88 POLITICAL POLYTHEISM The Three Views Actually, there are three common views today regarding Chris- tians and political participation: withdrawal, preservation, and re- placement (separation, accommodation, and transformation). Pre- millennial theology, especially dispensationalism, tended in practice toward the first view until the late 1970’s. Its proponents were con- tent to suffer the older, milder forms of persecution and ridicule by American political pluralism. AmiIlennialism and academic (his- toric) premillennialism have both favored the second view: salt and light in an age of permanent darkness. Its proponents have been self- consciously favorable to pluralism, even when the political system is authoritarian. They see no alternative except anarchy or outright tyranny. Theocratic postmillennialism favors the third view. Its pro- ponents are ready to use political pluralism until the day that Chris- tians have sufficient votes and voluntary support from the voting public to change the political rules. This is how the conspirators stole the republic from colonial American Christians; the stolen goods can be repossessed in exactly the same way. The question remains: Why should Christians get involved in politics? For many years in American history, especially after the repeal of the eighteenth amendment (Prohibition), which had pro- hibited the legal sale of alcoholic beverages, in 1933,57 fundamen- talist Christians could not think of a good reason. They might vote occasionally, but the y insisted that “politics is a dirty business ,“ and that it is a waste of time to seek political solutions to the problems of this world. They did not vote as a self-conscious political inter- est group, as they had in 1918, when the eighteenth amendment was passed. Dtyleat by D#ault The problem with this attitude is that it leaves the political arena under the domination of those who do believe that political action is the way to solve the major problems of this world. Christians for dec- ades did not understand that successful politics must be as much negative as positive: getting the State out of the affairs of men. (Few of them understand this today.) They did not devote themselves to the study of politics in general or to the biblical laws governing civil 57.

They did not learn that the~udicial goal of the civil government is overwhelming~ negative: prohibiting morally evil public acts rather than coercing individuals or organizations into doing acts of positive good. Thus, they were out of office when those who believe in political salvation — salvation by law — came into power and reshaped the American republic. They could not halt or even slow down the engine of secular humanism. Christians have become third-class citizens precisely because they have for too long believed that politics is a questionable activity for Christians. We are still residents in the world, of course, living in the midst of covenant-breakers. We cannot escape history. But Christians are inevitably at war throughout history with a rival kingdom which seeks to overcome us, as representatives of God’s kingdom. Christ has already definitively overcome this rival kingdom. “These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world” (John 16: 33). We shall progressively overcome it, too, as the representatives of Jesus Christ in history. 58 Only then will ,history end: “Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he bath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death” (I Cor. 15:24-26). If we represent God in history, how can we represent Jesus Christ in any capacity other than as definitive conquerors who are progressively working out the implications of this conquest in his- tory? To do less, we inescapably deny representationally His defini- tive victory over sin at Calvary, and His elevation to the right hand of God at the ascension. This is what the early Church believed. 59 It should be the modern Church’s vision, too.

And what nation is there so great, that bath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day? (Deut. 4:5-8). This passage was the judicial foundation of Christ’s discussion of the city on a hill: Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever there- fore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven (Matt. 5:13-17). The issue Jesus raises here is the law of God. Moses and Jesus are agreed: the testimony of the gospel in action is inevitably tied to the public, visible enforcement of the Bible-revealed law of God, beginning with self-government, but not stopping there.

By law, certain acts are abolished, and the persons committing those acts either executed or brought into conformity to law.”Gl And if a given political order is judicially schizophrenic, as all forms of political pluralism must be, then civil war or national defeat is inevitable: “If a doctrine of authority embodies contradictions within itself, then it is eventually bound to fall apart as the diverse strains war against one another. This has been a continuing part of the various crises of Western civilization. Because the Biblical doctrine of authority has been compromised by Greco-Roman humanism, the tensions of au- thority have been sharp and bitter.”GZ Dktente The modern humanist rejects all this. So does the modern politi- cal pluralist. So does the modern antinomian evangelical or funda- mentalist. All three are agreed: we are to seek political peace within the total family of man. We must therefore allow “equal time for Satan” in society. There is a growing problem with this platform: step by step, the civil authorities allow less and less time for Jesus. The transforma- tion of the American public school system is the obvious example. The Darwinists control it by law. This is the inevitable result of the theology of d~tente, the quest for permanent peace apart from the un- conditional surrender of all men to God. 63 The self-conscious party to the ddente agreement will use the extra time to consolidate his posi- tion at the expense of the naive party who misunderstands the nature of the treaty: a temporary cease-fire. This explains Western foreign policy’s continual defeats at the hands of the Soviet Union, and it also explains the nineteenth-century and twentieth-century political triumph of secular humanism in the West. ~ The prophet Ezekiel dealt plainly with those of his day who pro- moted the policy of diterzte. It stands as a warning throughout history to all those – especially priests within the household of faith — who would weaken the resistance of Christians to the lure of political pluralism.

They should be ready rather to doubt the benefits. What Defines What the Stipulations of a Covenant Are? Something must define the religion of the covenant in every cov- enantal institution. Each covenantal institution needs answers: Who is God, who represents God, what are God’s laws, what are His sanctions, and who will inherit ? There is no escape from this set of five questions. Christians have refused to deal with these questions for over two centuries, as testified to by the civil covenants under which they live contentedly. They refuse to go to the Bible in search of the answers. The Bible is the only self-authenticating visible Word today. It tells us what the laws of God are that govern each covenant.

Either we go to God’s Word in search of the answers or to man’s word. The two words are mutually irreconcilable. There is no neutrality. The political pluralist necessarily refuses to acknowledge that the Bible is authoritative in civil government. Were he to affirm such a thing, he would automatically abandon political pluralism. His official reason for not going to the Bible is that he fears a tyrannical mixture of Church and State. (I am including Christian defenders of political pluralism here.) He thinks of Old Covenant Israel as inherently tyran- nical. Then what of Egypt and Babylon? What of Greece and Rome? Were they bastions of civic freedom? And if they were, why did they continually and systematically oppress God’s covenant people? 65 There will always be a Church, in time and eternity.GG There will also be civil governments in history. There is no escape from the questions of the proper judicial relationships between Church and State. The six key questions are: 1) Who is the sovereign agent (or agents) who announces each covenant? 2) Who is authorized to de- fend each covenant? 3) Whose covenant standards will govern each covenant? 4) By what sanctions? 5) For how long? 6) What is the proper relation between these two covenantal institutions – the ques- tion of biblicall y appropriate mutual sanctions? American Christian- ity has deferred offering a clear answer to these six questions for over two and a half centuries.

Does the State have the God-authorized authority (note: authon”ty and author are linked) to compel all residents of a community to pay money to support a specific church, meaning, inevitably, a politically approved church? Today, few Christians would regard such State power as morally or legally valid. (I surely would not. ) Why not? There are many reasons that could be offered: too much power for the State, too close an association between specific churches and 65.

In the first case, the State compels the transfer; in the second case, the State in some economic sense subwdize$ the transfer by refraining from taxing the money so transferred. The transfer is en- couraged by means of either a negative sanction (taxation) or a positive sanction (tax-deductibility). Are the cases economical~ the same? Yes.

If the State can lawfully, morally compel a specific right- eous action, then the State becomes in most people’s eyes the domi- nant agent of social reform in society.’7 No other agency has the per- manent power of physical compulsion. (A parent exercises some minimal physical sanctions over minors, but this power ends at some legal point in the child’s life.) The State can force people to do what it wants. If the State is limited to prohibiting evil acts (which would also include public health measures against non-human organic in- vaders), then the most it can do to promote a particular social good is to restrain itse~ by refusing to confiscate an individual’s assets. It does not tell the individual what to do with his money. It only agrees to take less of the person’s assets if he does certain State-approved things with the money. In other words, rather than being a restraint on the individual, as is the case with State-enforced compulsory tith- ing, tax deductions on charitable gifts are in fact a political~ imposed 67. In fact, the Church is the dominant agency of social reform, for it presents the heavenly model of the eternal covenant between God and man. It alone provides the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, which is God’s common meal with redeemed mankind. But this fact of the Church’s predominant position must be accepted on faith. It is much more difficult to prove this by an appeal to historical records, once the view of the State as the positive reform agent becomes widespread in a society, and the bureaucrats start collecting money and issuing orders."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"SanctuaV and SuJrage 95 restraint on the State.cB Not so with compulsory tithing. Compulsory tithing is a decision by one segment of the electorate to hand a large stick to the State which is then used by the tax collector to beat some other citizen over the back until he turns over his money. A tax deduction is a stick in the hands of the electorate to beat the tax collector over the back un- til he leaves charitable people alone. He is not allowed to tax what they have given away. There is a dt@erence@dicial~, even if there is no difference economically. We get very different answers to the ques- tion: Who wields the stick, and whose back gets whacked? The difference between the two paths which the money takes is also crucial. On one path, the tax collector collects the funds and disburses them; on the other, the citizen does. Yet there is still a nagging problem. If the citizen is allowed to give money away before the “locusts” in the tax office sweep down to collect the produce of “the field,” is he allowed to give it to anyone, for any purpose? May he give it to relatives, tax-free? To a profit- seeking business that he owns? I think most people — non-anarchists, anyway — see that this would be wrong, for it would discriminate among taxpayers. Those who refuse to give away money would have to pay it to the State. Yet we want to encourage charity. How can we do this? Only through political pressure: instructing a majority of legislators to allow tax exemptions for specific purposes. Another question: Who decides what constitutes a church for tax purposes? It has to be an agency of the State. bg We are now back to the question of politics. Indirect Control Humanist critics of the Church today are attempting to force the recipients of tax money to do all sorts of humanist-required activi- ties. The case of Grove City College, a Presbyterian college in West- ern Pennsylvania, is instructive. It refused for many years to accept federal tax money, since it refuses to submit to a whole list of fed- eral regulations governing many aspects of education. To thwart the 68. This is not to say that the State cannot use this limitation to achieve its goals. If it offers a benefit, it can impose a cost. This is the great threat of tuition vouchers or tax credits for tuition to private schools. Their coercion is less direct. The bureau- crats must be more circumspect, however — less direct. 69.

The college does accept money from students who have received money from banks that are participating in a federal loan-guarantee program for student loans. Indirectly, the school benefits from the decision of the federal government to subsidize college education; hence, said the bureaucrats, it had to submit. The school protested, and the Supreme Court upheld the school. The Court said that Con- gress would have to enact specific legislation saying that all such monies constitute a back door to federal intrusion. In 1988, Con- gress overwhelmingly passed such a law, over the President’s veto, in the name of civil rights. Today, any organization which receives any sort of money, direct or indirect, as a result of federal legislation comes under all of the civil rights legislative controls, and these con- trols are comprehensive. He who pays the piper eventually calls the tune. Or more to the point, the piper’s authorized representative does, even if many individual pipers (taxpayers and voters) do not want to pay for it. So much for “free” federal money or bank loans that result from a federal program! But even this does not satisfy the controllers. They want to control those institutions that receive funds even more indirectly: tax-deductible funds. Institutions receiving such funds are prohibited from engaging in all sorts of practices. Take another example of higher education. Bob Jones University in South Carolina prohibits inter-racial dating, a policy that most (probably all) of the parents of the students approve of. The school can more easily “take the heat” from protesting students than parents can, so the parents prefer to delegate this authority. The federal govern- ment removed the school’s tax exemption in 1985. The Supreme Court upheld this decision. The precedent is set. There is no limit in principle as to how far this back-door intervention can go. It is a political question. We are again back to the question of politics. The Embarrassing Question of Theocracy In all these cases, the State has to determine what is or is not law- ful. What is a lawful charity? What is a lawful local church? What can the designated recipients lawfully do with the funds received as a result of a federal subsidy, direct or indirect, compulsory or volun- tary? There is no neutrali@ Some groups and some activities will"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Sanctuary and Su&-age 97 always be prohibited from receiving the subsidy. The question then is: By what standard shouid the State decide? These issues are now becoming clearer to the humanists who hate the Church, as well as to a much smaller number of Christians, but the recommended Christian solutions are not at all clear. Radical humanists would gladly repeal all laws that grant either tax- exemption or tax-deduction privileges for donors to churches and Christian schools. There are even a few humanist-influenced Chris- tians who would agree. But most Christians see where such an argu- ment easily leads: to the control of the churches by the State. The power to tax is the power to destroy, announced Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall in 181970 – the case revolved around the taxing of a federally chartered bank by a state government — and few Christians would disagree. T~ But how can the consistent Christian defend the lawful sovereignty of a particular church against State control without also raising the embarrassing question of theocracy? Who is to say what constitutes a church? By what standard? If the Christian says that anyone can setup a tax-immune or tax- exempt institution designated as a church, whatever the theology of the church happens to be, he has thereby admitted that other reli- gious faiths are judicially equal to Christianity. Such a latitudinarian view regarding the establishing of churches allows many “strangers in the gates” to establish rival institutions that compete on an equal basis with the true and only covenant Church. This clearly violates Old Testament law. Everyone recognizes this, so Christians today have publicly abandoned this aspect of Old Testament law. But where does this principle of equality end? What about sut- tee, the Hindu practice of forcing widows onto the funeral pyres of their husbands? What about polygamy, the Mormon practice which has never been condemned theologically by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, but only suppressed provisionally for the present? What about some “native Americans’” (Indians’) prac- tice of using hallucinogenic drugs in their worship services? What of orthodox Judaism’s practice of enforcing laws against work on Satur- day? (In the state of Israel, radical Orthodox Jews sometimes block 70. McCulloch v. MaVland. 71. Christians need to argue that churches are legally and inherently tax-immune.

There will always be certain practices and beliefs that are considered too perverse for any society to allow in public. There is no neutrali~. Still, if many “churches” are allowed to preach their rival messages, then this raises an unavoidable general question: What is the basis of social cohesion? It also raises a specific question: What should be the basis of civil law? Natural Law Traditionally, the answer of Protestants since the Protestant Ref- ormation has been an appeal to universal principles of natural law. The Roman Catholic Church also accepted this principle of law, which the Church fathers had reworked from Stoic natural rights theory. But there are several problems with this natural-law ap- proach. The first problem is the religious basis of modern natural law theory: humanism. Historian Paul Hazard discusses this in his chapter on natural law: “Natural law was the offspring of a philoso- phy which rejected the supernatural, the divine, and substituted, for the acts and purposes of a personal God, an immanent form of nature.”y2 How can Christians safely rely on a legal theory that is either atheistic or pantheistic? Second, Darwinism blew natural law theory to Kingdom Never Come. Darwin’s universe is a universe without purpose, where everything evolves in terms ofjwesent~ sovereign but evolving environ- mental constraints. The iron law of nature changes. It is altered by random responses to environmental constraints. “Varieties then arise we know not why,” said Thomas Huxley, Darwin’s popularizer. 73 Darwinism persuaded men that the world is under the control of continually evolving forces in a purposeless environment. These laws can be discovered by scientists, thereby enabling “man” (mean- ing the scientists and technicians) to take control of his environment. Socialists then persuaded men that there are also evolving laws of so- ciety, that these laws can be discovered by highly trained experts, and these experts can then show politicians how to achieve their so- 72.

But there is no moral law, no universal, permanent “natural” principles of morality. There is no cosmic sovereign, other than col- lective man, to appeal to. This intellectually powerful combination of Darwinism and central planning explains why the faith of the twentieth century has been in the power of the State to solve the fun- damental problems of this life. The Right of Appeal To what “higher law” can the Christian citizen appeal in the face of widespread injustice, injustice that has been fostered and pro- tected by the State? To what lawful authority, other than mere power, can Christians appeal? Is Christianity just another special- interest group, clawing for political power? Or, even if Christians are acting as God’s spokesmen, must Christians always conduct themselves politically as if Christianity were just another special- interest group? Do Christians conduct evangelism this way? Do they believe that the gospel is just another competing worldview am?ng many? That Jesus is just another Messiah competing among many? That the God of the Bible is just another divinity competing against many? In short, in order to be a Christian, must a person accept as mor- ally and judicially permanent a world in which there will always be many gods, many laws, many spokesmen, and many warring na- tions? Or can a Christian rest assured that someday, in history and on earth, the Spirit-induced spread of the gospel will at last silence the many rival voices, and that people will proclaim allegiance pub- licly to the God of the Bible? We know this will be true in the post- resurrection world. Can we not hope to see this world steadily begin to manifest its principles in history? 74. The first and most prominent American scholar who maintained this view was the sociologist, Lester Frank Ward, whose two-volume work, Dynamic Sociology (1883), was the first study to articulate the view. By 1900, it was the dominant view among progressive social scientists.

This is what a world of many competing laws really is: polytheism. Whenever ‘Israel allowed polytheism to flourish, she came under judgment: the nations of the gods Israel worshiped conquered the land for a generation or more. Why do we think we are immune to similar judgments? In fact, hasn’t this conquest already taken place domestically– in America’s public schools, in the communications field, in the enter- tainment industry, in the abortionist’s office, in corporate finance, in science and technology, and in politics? We are again back to the question of politics. Pluralism’s Silent, Empty Temple It is time to faceup to the real-world implications of the theology of political pluralism. Michael Novak, the Roman Catholic scholar, has become one of the major intellectual defenders of the pluralist ideology today. Until pluralism’s Christian defenders come to grips with Novak’s description of the theology which undergirds plural- ism, they will be like blind men leading others into the ditch. Novak writes: “In a genuinely pluralistic society, there is no one sacred canopy. By intention there is not. At its spiritual core, there is an empty shrine. That shrine is left empty in the knowledge that no one word, image, or symbol is worthy of what all seek there. Its empti- ness, therefore, represents the transcendence which is approached by free consciences from a virtually infinite number of directions. . . . Believer and unbeliever, selfless and selfish, frightened and bold, naive and jaded, all participate in an order whose center is not socially imposed.”75 Questions: What holds the society together when the centrifugal forces of political ideology begin to shatter this ever-silent voice of pluralism? What voice of reason or morality can ever speak out from the empty shrine? And why should anyone pay any attention to it if it ever does? Can it impose sanctions in history? Lutheran scholar Richard John Neuhaus says that he is dis- turbed by the implications of Novak’s empty shrine, for it comes too close to the naked public square which Neuhaus rejects. But what 75.

Certainly not an answer based on polit- ical theory, let alone Remans 13:1-7. Political persuasion is always and inescapable y fiersua.sion to coerce others by means of ciuil law. It means persuasion to change any existing coercive sanctions. How can democratic persuasion be proposed as an alternative to coercion? Democratic persuasion is a means to coercion. Don’t democratic ma- jorities coerce those who lose the political battles? Aren’t the “ins” ready and willing to see the “outs” suffer the consequences of defeat at the polls? This is not to say that there are not all sorts of restraints on majorities, institutional and constitutional. But ultimately, all governments say yes to laws that say no to someone. All Law Is Theocratic Once a pluralist admits this, he is led, kicking and screaming, into the open arms of the theocrats — theocrats who proclaim one god or another. Today, we live in a humanist theocracy where “man, the collective” is worshiped as god. On the other hand, if “we, the re- generate, covenanted people” ever get a sufficient number of votes, we could legally amend the Constitution. Unless you accept the view of those who argue that there must be absolute unanimity of all special-interest groups before civil government can lawfully take any action — some version of Calhoun’s utopian (and pro-slavery) theory of the concurrent majorit y 77 – you must accept the conclusion that democratic persuasion is on~ an intermedia~ step to coercion. Coercion is also a way to increase democratic persuasion: the federal civil rights legislation of the early 1960’s is an example. White southerners literally changed their minds regarding racial segregation because of these laws, and they did so by the end of the decade. (Does any historian want to defend the hypothesis that the Civil Rights law of 1964 was passed by the U.S. Congress because the white-voter-dominated American South had already changed its collective mind?) All civil government is inherently coercive, for it possesses a lawful, God-granted monopoly to bear the sword. Civil 76.

There can be no escape from the conclusion that democratic @-- suasion is not an alternative to coercion; it is simp~ one competing system of coercion among many. This is the dilemma of democratic pluralism. It pretends not to be coercive whenever it challenges biblical theocracy. It pretends to have at its center a silent temple, when in fact the self-proclaimed god of autonomous man sits on the throne, with his authorized agents shouting orders. It is time for democratic pluralists to stop pretending. The temple has never been silent; the public square has never been naked. The humanist emperor has a whole wardrobe of humanist fashions. He only pretends to be theologically naked, the better to confuse the Christians. (And how well this pretense has worked!) It is time for Christians to shout the truth: “The Emperor has clothes!” His whole wardrobe is stolen. This is God’s world, not Satan’s. Christians are the lawful heirs, not non-Christians. 78 The Silence of God The so-called “transcendent” is required by Novak’s pluralist man to sit silent in its empty box. If “the transcendent” were to speak clearly in a voice other than autonomous man’s, this would put an end to pluralism. Thus, when it comes to the transcendent, Novak insists, silence is golden — golden, as in “golden calf.” Let the Chris- tian defenders of pluralism deal openly with Novak’s challenge: “The ‘wasteland’ at the heart of democratic capitalism is like a field of bat- tle, on which individuals wander alon~, in some confusion, amid many casualties. Nonetheless, like the dark night of the soul in the inner journey of the mystics, this desert has an indispensable pur- pose. It is maintained out of respect for the diversity of human con- sciences, perceptions, and intentions. It is swept clean out of reverence for the sphere of the transcendent, to which the individual has access through the self, beyond the mediations of social institu- tions. The domain of the transcendent, of course, is mediated by lit- erature, religion, family, and fellows. But it is finally centered in the silence in each person.”79 That is to say, the transcendent had better keep its big mouth shut. Autonomous man is now on the scene. The 78.

God’s Law Is Society’s Covenantal Center In the center of Israel, culturally speaking, was the dwelling place of God’s glory cloud. God was in the midst of this cloud. The cloud resided in the Tabernacle (Ex. 40:34) and later in the Temple (I Ki. 8:1). Inside the Temple was the holy of holies, where once a year the high priest representatively entered to offer a blood sacrifice for the nation. This was the meeting place between God and His cove- nant people. Inside the holy of holies was the Ark of the Covenant. Inside the Ark of the Covenant were the two tablets of God’s covenant law, the Ten Commandments, the treaty of the Great King. 81 It does not require a genius-level IQ to deduce the meaning of this spatial ar- rangement. It placed God’s covenant law at the representative center of societ y. This is how God manifested Himself to mankind. Today, He manifests Himself visibly through the Bible and the sacraments .82 We theonomists are surely at least as forthright as Novak is.

The End of the Road It is my contention that they cannot do better; they are visibly out of coherent arguments. They content themselves by repeating old ones, all of which rest squarely on two false presuppositions: 1) the myth of intellectual and moral neutrality and 2) the existence of natural law, recognizable by and authoritative for fallen man. It assumes, in short, the logical character of the ethical. Man is saved by knowledge, or at the very least, the road to salvation is made visi- ble (to at least some men) through logic. “Right reason” can discover natural law. (But who determines which methodology is ‘right,” and which logical presentation within that methodology is “right”?) By means of these two false assumptions, pluralists conclude that it is illegitimate in the New Covenant era to presume that civil gov- ernment is a covenantal institution, that is, bound by biblical law to enforce biblical law. As the faith of Christians wanes in these false presuppositions, the glaring inconsistencies of the pluralists will be- come increasingly apparent to Bible-believing Christians.

God’s sanctions in history are approaching. Choose this day whom you will serve. The Halfway Covenant The New England Puritans believed in God’s institutional cove- nants: ecclesiastical, family, and civil. But they made a strategic theological error in the early years of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, one from which their holy commonwealth experiment never recov- ered. The y added an extra-biblical requirement for entry into full church membership: the recounting of a personal conversion experi- ence. This rule was added sometime in the period 1633-36. 94 No longer would the familiar Reformed pair of requirements – profession of orthodox faith and an outwardly moral life — be sufficient for en- trance into full church membership. The second generation of New England Puritans did not experience the emotions of the “exodus” from England, so the majority of them “failed to own the covenant ,“ as the language of the day put it. They did not become communicant members, or they did so only after bearing children. This created a major theological problem: What was to be done with their children? Should these children be baptized or not? Their parents had been baptized, but were not communicant members. So, in what way did the third generation have a covenant claim on the rite of baptism? 94.

They had to depart from the old norm: that only the children of full church members could be baptized. The churches baptized the grandchildren of that first gener- ation, but they refused to serve them communion. Writes historian Edmund Morgan: “Given both infant baptism and the restriction of church membership to visible saints, it was impossible for the Puri- tans either to evade the questions just posed or to answer them with- out an elaborate casuistry that bred dissatisfaction and disagree- ment. The history of New England churches during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was in large measure a history of these dis- satisfactions and disagreements .“ 95 The Congregational system never recovered from this confusion of status. It was replaced in the first four decades of the eighteenth century by revivalism and sectar- ianism. The political and theological foundations of the holy com- monwealths of New England collapsed under the resulting social strain when the third generation came to maturity. % Thus, one seemingly minor theological error early in New Eng- land Puritan history – the requirement of an extra-biblical experi- ence of conversion — led step by step to the destruction of the Puritan experiment in covenantal order. This error was not the only cause of the failure of that experiment, but it was a major one. It was a theo- logical failure, and the New England Puritans, Calvinists to the bit- ter end, took theology very seriously. I have adopted the term ha@ay covenant in this book for a reason: to show how seemingly minor errors in an otherwise consistent Cal- vinist theological system can and have led to a serious breakdown of Calvinist theology. Because of the ethical nature of these disastrous and fundamental errors — the denial of four of the five points of the biblical covenant – they strike at the heart of all forms of Bible- believing Christianity. These errors are widely shared, but Calvin- ists, being more theologically inclined, and possessing a more detail- ed and rigorous theological system, have had the greatest difficulty in dealing with these discrepancies. These discrepancies strike at the heart of covenant theology, and Calvinists are self-consciously the 95. Ibid. , pp. 128-29, 96.

Conclusion This book begins with the assumption that God’s Old Testament law is still valid ii New Testament t~mes, unless a particular law has been annulled specifically or by clear implication by the New Testa- ment. I do not want to defend this thesis here. It has been defended by others elsewhere.97 I have explained at considerable length (and expense!) how Old Testament laws apply to the field of economics. ga This challenge to the humanist social order has been delayed for three centuries. Christian casuistry – the application of God’s fixed laws to the changing realm of history– as a separate discipline went into eclipse in the final quarter of the seventeenth century, and only re-emerged three cenuries later. As recently as 1948, Kenneth Kirk could write: “But in general it may be said that the lack of a continu- ous and authoritative tradition, the pressure of other interests, the growth of philosophical individualism, with the consequent decline of the sense of loyalty . . . all combined to sterilise the Reformed casuistry. From the beginning of the eighteenth century you may look in vain for anything approaching a systematic grasp of the par- ticular problems of morality. It is for the historian of modern Christi- anity to say how far this fact has been the cause of that impotence of the Churches which is so often deplored.”gg In 1948, there was no change on the visible horizon. Now there is. What I want the reader to understand is that he cannot legiti- mately avoid the religious problems associated with politics. Whose 97. R. J.

The Choices Before Us There are three choices politically: life under God’s civil cove- nant, life under a rival sovereign’s civil covenant, and life in a tempor- ary civil order in which there are rival civil covenant principles com- peting for allegiance, where the outcome of the competition is still an open question in the minds of most political participants. This last system is generally called political Pluralism. Its defenders think this system can be made permanent. They are incorrect. There are too many people around like I am who eventually topple the system. Political pluralism is a halfway house system that lasts only as long as no group or major coalition can take over politically and an- nounce a specific new civil covenant. It is a stand-off, a temporary stalemate, a temporary cease-fire. It is defended today as if it were a permanent condition, “as if pluralism were a permanent political phi- losophy. It is not. It is the political philosophy of the temporary cease-fire. Today, the West lives officially under the civil covenant of politi- cal pluralism, but the balance of political power in this century has shifted to a humanist theocracy. The humanist theocrats hide what has happened in the language of moral and judicial neutrality. This has been a very successful camouflage operation. Until the abortion question blew a hole in the rhetoric of the myth of neutrality, the vast majority of Christians believed in political pluralism as a philosophy. That majority is still vast, but less so than before. But vast, three- quarters ‘vast”, or even less, it is clinging to a philosophically and morally dead system. Its defenders have yet to present a systematic defense of its claims to universality. They have not been able to dem- onstrate how pluralism is compatible with the Bible, the writings of 102.

This commandment was given to the Israelites regarding their future conquest of the land of Canaan. They were to exterminate the Canaanites because of the threat that Canaan’s local, land-based idols of Canaan would pose to them. The gods of the land in the an- cient world were always the most threatening to the conquerors, which is why conquerors either exterminated their enemies or made slaves of them, sending them back to the home city. There could be no peace treaty without shared gods. The Israelites did not at first knowingly make national covenants with the gods of Canaan, but over time, they adopted the ethical and ritual practices of these gods. Step by step, they broke God’s cove- nants: in family, Church, and finally State. From time to time, God delivered them into the hands of invaders who would reign in the land. Finally, He allowed invaders to enter the land, capture the people, and send them into foreign bondage. But He had promised them that they would not remain in bondage there permanently, for ‘ He had made His covenant with them: “And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the L ORD their God” (Lev. 26:44). He was God over Babylon, too. The problem in the New Testament era is culturally different. Christians understand that to worship another god is to break cove- nant with Christ. So, Satan has invented a remarkably successful strategy: to persuade Chris~ians that the God of the Bible is the same god as the one who is discovered by the light of autonomous reason.

This form of covenant-making has been going on in civil govern- ment ever since Roger Williams established the province of Rhode Island in 1636. Philosophically, this transfer of covenantal allegiance had been going on since the early Church’s apologists adopted Greek catego- ries of reasoning. A truth that could be proven by Greek logic was assumed to be a truth for the God of the Bible. After all, Christians reasoned, “there cannot be two kinds of truth. There is only one truth.” The problem was, they did not understand that a system of logic that begins with the presupposition of the adequacy of the fallen mind of man is not going to lead to the same conclusions as a system of logic that begins with the presupposition of the self- contained, Trinitarian, Creator God of the Bible. The conclusions may initially appear to be the same, but they are different. Chris- tians do not understand this principle today, either. The existence of the “neutral” public school system filled with the sons and daughters of Christians is a visible testimony to this fact of self-imposed blindness. If Christians can be seduced into believing that the common rea- son of man leads to the same system of moral law that the revelation of the Bible presents, then the first step toward a forbidden covenant has been taken. If the moral law-order is the same, then why not the civil law-order? And if the civil law-order is the same in each system, then why not establish a constitutional order in which there is uni- versal suffrage based on physical birth or on non-creedal criteria for “adoption,” i.e., naturalization? The day that such an order becomes the civil law of the land, Christians have entered into a civil covenant with those who worship different gods. Political struggles to control the institutions of civil government will then begin in earnest. A civil war breaks out, but Christians are the last ones to recognize it. They refuse to see it. To admit that there is no common law-order based on common reason is to admit that Christians have entered into a prohibited civil cove- nant. Christians have been lured into such prohibited covenants all over the world. To admit that this has taken place would be to admit their sin, not their mere ignorance, and so they do not admit it.

It divides Old Covenant Israel from all New Covenant nations. This is the heart of all Christian political pluralism: to make a definitive break from ancient Israel, for the pluralists must persuade their listeners that there are no sanctions in history for disobeying God’s national covenantal laws. Their strat- egy is to make a rigorous judicial separation between ancient Israel and modern national covenants. Their tactic is to make Old Cove- nant Israel utterly unique in covenant history, meaning ~“udicial~ unique. Their rhetoric is designed to obscure the judicial connec- tion — especially historical sanctions — by means of endless qualifica- tions and exceptions. Writes Kenneth Myers: Israel had an obligation to be a covenantally righteous nation, to meet standards that God did not establish for, say, Egypt. Israel was a holy na- tion as no nation before or since could claim to be. Its national identity was a mechanism of God’s redemptive work in a unique way. In every aspect of its national life as ordered by God, Israel was anticipating the character of the people of God upon the consummation of redemptive history. . . . To regard either the law (as do my postmillennialist friends and some of my premillennialist fi-iends) or the prophets (as do many of my premillennialist and amillennialist friends) as speaking univocally to the United States begs too many questions, to say the least.

Similarly, we must not take the declamations of the prophets out of their es- chatological context and regard them as timeless wisdom.

Unfortunately, many of these doctrines are obscured in the attempt to reduplicate Israel’s national polity or to antici- pate the eschatological kingdom in ways we are not meant to. Until Christ returns, the church is God’s new holy nation, and God has postponed his judgment. Our thinking about political obedience must keep this in view. 2 God has postponed His judgment, we are reassured. Indeed He has – His jinal judgment. This is so obvious a fact that we need to search for the reason why Myers even mentions it. The reason is rhetorical: he wants to deflect the reader’s attention from the funda- mental covenantal question of the historical sanctions brought by God against New Covenant era nations. But, to reassure us regarding his orthodoxy, he announces: “I am not dismissing the Old Testament; I am merely trying to respect its intentions.”3 If this sounds to you like the old liberal refrain, “I am not dismissing the doctrine of the bodily resurrection of Christ; I am merely trying to respect its intentions,” then you detect what I detect, and I suspect that the reasons for each statement are analogous: to escape the couenantal implications in histo~ of God’s Word.

Again, a recurring theme is the absence of God’s sanctions in his- tory: “A Christian view of justice, a Christian view of modern poli- tics, I believe, should be built on this understanding of God’s gracious patience during this age.” 15 This leads him to political pluralism, the politics of (we hope and pray, silently, of course, in our private prayer closets) equal timeforJesu.s. “It would not be C/zristian justice for Christians to enjoy some political privilege denied to others.”lG This kind of enthusiastic rhetoric for the integrity of the Bible but without any commitment to its judicial specifics or attached civil sanctions is analogous to enthusiastic rhetoric for the integrity of marriage by bachelors who subscribe only to Playboy. It sounds good, but I am more than a little suspicious regarding both the intent of the rhetoric and its probable outcome. 13.

It boils down, says Pound, to what the individual conscience dictates; and consciences differ. “An eigh- teenth-century jurist laying down natural law and Bentham’s man who claimed to be one of the elect are in the same position. Each is giving us his personal views and is assuming that those views must be binding upon everyone else.” The point is well taken as regards eighteenth and much of nineteenth-century thought, under which there is no longer a common ethos, For lack of it, as Pound points out, jurists have fallen back on interest as the basis of law, and have conceived the problem of jurisprudence as the evaluation or har- monization of interests — as indeed, on the practical plane, it largely (though never wholly) is. But the problem is insoluble without cri- teria. The evaluation of anything is impossible without a standard. The assumption that out of the clash of group interests as such an harmonious synthesis can-be devised or discovered is simply a return to natural law by the back window because the key of the door has been lost. As Woodrow Wilson said in 1918, “interest does not bind men together: interest separates men . . . There is only one thing that can bind people together, and that is common devotion to right .“ The emphasis is on the word common. Only where there exists a fundamental agreement, not perhaps of explicit belief, but of out- look, feeling, and value, is true toleration possible. It was this that both Burke and Acton had in mind; it was to this that Catholic schol- ars referred — as they still do — when they made the secular state subject to natural law; it was this that made political freedom possible.

Van Til on Special Creation Van Til unquestionably defended point one: the absolute sover- eignty of God. In fact, this is the heart of his methodology: a clear defense of the doctrine of special creation. He insisted on a radical distinction between Creator and creature. He also insisted on the total providence of God the Trinity. He defended the biblical concept of cosmic personalism, a Trinitarian doctrine. 4 Van Til was a self- conscious creationist. More than any other philosophical system in man’s history, his is anti-evolutionary. 5 He was adamant: “The doc- trines of creation and providence imply that God originates and ar- ranges all the facts of the universe according to a logic’ that is above man. Man’s systems must therefore be consciously analogical to the system of God.”G Even more emphatically: “It is in terms of God who is self-existent and self-contained and in terms of the doctrines of creation and providence, taken without qualification, that man knows the goal, the standards and the motivating principle of life.”z “The idea of creation makes a distinction between God and man. Anyone holding to the idea of creation (we speak of temporal and not of logical creation) must also hold to the idea of a God who ex- isted apart from the world and had meaning for himself apart from the world. And this point goes counter to the first principle of Greek speculation spoken of, that all things are at bottom one. If theism is right, all things are at bottom two, and not one. . . .

The only common ground between them, he insisted, is their shared image of God. 10 This was the basis of his denial of all forms of natural law theory, the unique feature of his apologetic system. “It will not do to ignore the difference between Christians and non-Christians and speak of reason in general. Such a thing does not exist in practice.”ll His radical, uncompromising re- jection of all forms of natural law philosophy separated him from all previous Christian apologists. He was aware of this, and was sys- tematic in his criticisms of all other Christian apologists for their compromises with natural law, common-ground intellectual strategies. The image of God in man was important for another aspect of his system of epistemology: the link between human minds, and between God’s mind and man’s. Epistemology asks: ‘What can man know, and on what basis does he know it?” Van Til taught that man is supposed to think his thoughts after God as a creature made in God’s image. This is clearly a system of hierarchical reasoning. Man is the subordinate. “Human reason is not a simple linear extension of divine reasoning. The human activity or interpretation always runs alongside of and is subordinate to the main plan and purpose of God.” 12 God is the primary thinker; man is secondary. God thinks creatively; man thinks re-creatively. “The natural man wants to be creatively constructive instead of receptively reconstructive.” 13 To this extent, Van Til was faithful to point two of the covenant: hierarchy. 8.

Because apart from point one, and apart from his concept of analogical reasoning, he denied the biblical covenant model. The details of this model had not been developed by Sutton while Van Til was still intellectually active, but Van Til actually denied the biblical content of this model, section by section. While he affirmed point two – hierarchy – in terms of individual reasoning, he did not discuss the question of cor- porate reasoning, i.e., the division of intellectual labor covenantally. Furthermore, he told men to think reconstructively, but he never spoke of this reconstructive thinking as leading to the reconstruction of social institutions. He never discussed the obvious: that wherever self-proclaimed autonomous man has attempted to build human cul- ture on the basis of his assumption that he is creatively constructive, he has built institutions that clearly need to be reconstructed. Van Til self-consciously refused to affirm the legitimacy of Rushdoony’s attempt to extend Van Til’s reconstructive apologetic methodology into the field of social philosophy. More than this: he never publicly discussed how any other such attempt at Christian social reconstruc- tion might be begun. Van Til also ignored all questions regarding judicial representation — specifically, the judicial-covenantal basis of all institutional hierar- chies, especially civil governments. In short, Van Til had no doctrine OJ the national covenant. Yet this is a crucial aspect of man’s obedience to God as a covenant-keeper. God has not abolished the covenantal foundation of civil government in the New Testament era (Rem. 12:17-13: 7). So, the biblically legitimate question is never “covenant or no covenant” with respect to civil government. It is always a ques- tion of whose covenant. Points Three Through Five When it came to points three through five of the covenant, he was either silent (the content of God’s law: point three), or hostile (historical sanctions and historical inheritance: points four and five). Van Til’s amillennial view of God’s promised external, cultural, cov- enantal blessings (Deut. 28:1-14), as with premillennialim’s view, was exclusively attached to a trans-historical, discontinuous event: Christ’s second coming. This ethical futurism is the heart and soul of his system’s antinomianism. It is also the heart and soul of the anti- nomianism that today afflicts the whole Christian Church. It is the"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Hal@ay Covenant Ethics 131 theology of “pie in the sky by and by.” It is the necessary theological foundation of the various Christian versions of the escapist religion. 14 Its widespread influence in our day has both paralleled and aided the growing influence of Marxist liberation theology, which correctly labels such a view of history as escapist and irrelevant to the material and social needs of people in time and on earth. 15 The Church must abandon such a view of the supposed impotence of God’s covenantal judgments in history; if it refuses, planet earth will not be liberated. 16 Van Til never referred in his writings to God-revealed Old Testa- ment biblical law as the only systematically Christian alternative to autonomous man’s natural law. He quite properly called on Chris- tians to abandon every trace of natural law philosophy, and then refused to suggest an alternative. But it was not enough for Van Til to offer us a technical apologetic approach; he was obligated to offer a biblical ethical alternative. He steadfastly refused to comment on the specifics of real-world ethical matters. His silence was inappro- priate, given the magnitude of his presuppositional apol~getic meth- odology’s successful demolition of natural law theory. Van Ti.1 challenged the autonomy of man in every area of thought but one: law. He self-consciously and systematically destroyed the epistemological foundation of natural law theory: the concept of neutral human reason. He was a biblical presuppositionalist as no other Christian philosopher in history had ever been before him. He fully understood this, and he operated professionally in terms of this. 17 He denied that at any point can men see anything neutrally. There is no neutrality anywhere in the universe, he insisted. You either believe God or you don’t. You are either a covenant-keeper or you aren’t. 14.

He should have understood what he was doing. He was like a demolitions expert who places explosives at the base of a dike and triggers an explosion. This is what he did at the base of the incomparably leaky dike of natural law theory. But Van Til never publicly asked himself this crucial question: “After the dike of natural law is shattered, what will take its place?” Even more to the point, “Should I build a back-up dike before I blow up the exist- ing one?” Van Til never offered any answers to these crucial ques- tions. He had no recommendations regarding Church or civil legal standards. He apparently believed that it was not his job to provide such answers, as if natural law philosophy had not stood for almost two millennia as virtually the sole foundation of Christian political theory. All he ever wanted to do academically was blow up theologi- cally inconsistent leaky dikes. He built no restraining wall. The only reliable materials available for building such a wall are the biblical case laws, found mostly in the Old Testament, and Van Til refused to use them. But the pagan sea of ethical nihilism always threatens to rush in with full force to carry away the last traces of Christian civili- zation. (This was also my criticism of Free University of Amsterdam professor A. Troost back in 1967.) 1s Van Til taught that there is a radical distinction between cove- nant-keeping man’s concept of culture and covenant-breaking man’s concept. He insisted that there must be a specifically Christian goal, standard, and motivation for culture. The goal is the glory of God. The standard is the way of Christ. The motivation is the discovery of God’s grace in culture. 19 But he offered no explicitly biblical defini- tion of this standard, which would also make it impossible for cove- nant-keepers to assess when they have found God’s grace in culture. As I shall argue throughout this essay, Van Til’s antinomianism (no explicitly biblical standard for culture) was the fraternzd twin brother of his pessimism regarding Christianity’s earthly influence in the future (amillennialism). I think his theological supporters instinctively recognize the risk in such a demolition operation, yet they are also hostile to biblical law, so he has never recruited many disciples. They know that he is 18. Gary North, The Sinai Stra&gy: Economics and the Ten Commandnwnts (Tyler, Texas: Institute for Christian Economics, 1986), Appendix C: “Social Antinomianism.’ 19.

This becomes especially apparent when the student of Van Til begins to face the problems of sockd ethics. Rushdoony did use biblical law in the construction of his prelimi- nary judicial restraining wall, so he had no fear of using Van Til’s apologetic system to attack natural law. This is why the Christian Reconstructionists have inherited the bulk of Van Til’s legacy.20 We alone are willing to blow up eve~ dam based in any way on natural law, no matter where we find one, because we alone have a reliable retaining wall in reserve: biblical law.

The Key Contradiction No one has said this in print, but it is time to say it: Van Til’s original system has a glaring contradiction in it, one which doomed it from the beginning. All his life, he proclaimed the sole and exclu- sive validity of presuppositional apologetics. What did he mean by the term? He meant that there are two (and only two) ways of viewing the world: as a covenant-keeper or as a covenant-breaker. At the heart of his apologetic method was the fundamental concept of the biblical covenant. 23 He spoke of man as “a covenant personality.”24 He insisted that “The rational creature of God must naturally live by authority in all the activities of his personality. All these activities are inherently covenantal activities either of obedience or disobedi- ence.* 25 But Van Til never ex@ained in detail what the biblical covenant is. (I suspect that this was because he deferred to the writings on the covenant of his teacher Geerhardus Vos, whose influence over him was great, 26 and his colleague at Westminster, the Presbyterian eth- icist John Murray. 27) From time to time, and in many, many places –just try to locate some key phrase – he did describe in piecemeal fashion certain of the covenant’s features. The covenant is a legal bond 22. I suspect that he would have preferred Greg Bahnsen, but Bahnsen upheld the dreaded doctrine of theonomy, even going so far as to name it. To have had Bahnsen as his successor would have produced the same bothersome result: students might conclude that theonomy and presuppositionalism are inherently linked, the idea Van Til was at pains to deny privately and ignore publicly. 23. “Thus Scripture may be said to be the written expression of God’s covenant with man.” Van Til, “Nature and Scripture, n in The Infallible Word: A Symposium, by the faculty of Westminster Theological Seminary (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerd- mans, 1947), p. 256. 24.

Ethics is funda- mental, he repeated throughout his career, not intelligence. He used to say in the classroom that Christians do not get a new set of brains when they get converted. Obedience to God is fundamental, not precise thinking. In one of his marvelous analogies, he said that it does not matter how much you sharpen a buzz saw if it is set at the wrong angle: if it is crooked, it will not cut straight. The “angle” ob- viously has to refer to God’s covenant law, but he never discussed any details. Despite the centrality in his thinking of the biblical covenant , 28 Van Til refused to discuss covenant law. He refused to discuss which laws are still part of God’s covenant law-order. He always discussed epistemolo~ — ‘What can man know, and how can he know it?” – in terms of ethics: ‘What does man do, and why does he do it?” Now if anything is obvious from Scripture it is that man is not regarded as properly a judge of God’s revelation to him. Man is said or assumed from the first page to the last to be a creature of God. God’s consciousness is therefore taken to be naturally original as man’s is naturally derivative. Man’s natural attitude in all self-conscious activities was therefore meant to be that of obedience. It is to this deeper depth, deeper than the sinner’s con- sciousness can ever reach by itself, that Scripture appeals when it says: “Come let us reason together.” It appeals to covenant-breakers and argues with them about the unreasonableness of covenant-breaking. 29 Nevertheless, despite his heavy reliance on the concept of cove- nantal obedience as the basis of man’s correct knowledge about the universe, Van Til steadfastly refused to discuss biblical law. He attacked natural law but put nothing in its place. He devoted his life 28.

The true heart of his apologetic system is covenantal ethics, but the system is cloaked in the language of logic and epistemology. The heart of his system is the covenant, but his language is misleadingly philosophical. This misleading language is reflected in his famous phrase, epistemological se~-consciousness. By this phrase, he meant a person’s ability (and willingness) to see what he is in relation to God, and then think in terms of it. Yet he always knew that thought is tied to action, that it is not just what man thinks but also how he acts. We always know God covenantally and on~ covenantally. There is no other God to know but the God of the covenant.

Yet I do not recall ever seeing this phrase in his writings. Ethics and Eschatology Part of this self-imposed confusion in Van Til’s apologetics is the fault of his amillennial eschatology: it leads to a debilitating pessi- mism concerning the earthly future of the kingdom of God. 30 He fol- lowed what he thought had been the eschatology of Geerhardus Vos: “Dr. Vos makes plain that there is a two-fold aspect to Jesus’ teaching of the kingdom. Righteousness and conversion have to do with the present aspect of the kingdom, and blessedness primarily with the future aspect of the kingdom.”31 (In fact, Vos may have been a mild postmillennialist, but since he was Dutch, no one could quite believe it.)sz In other words, Van Til and other Dutch-background amillen- 30.

They argue that because God refuses to grant His covenant people the external blessings necessary for the construction of a uniquely Christian civilization, Christians will never be able by the Spirit to subdue His enemies in history. There is supposedly a sharp discontinuity in the New Testament era between God’s covenantal promises and their temporal fulfillment, between faithful performance and visible reward. Van Til said that the full manifestation of God’s covenant bless- ings will come only at Christ’s final coming, which he calls a “cata- strophic” event. 33 He utterly rejected postmillennialism’s optimism concerning the temporal future: “On the other hand there is a danger that we should think that since Christ has set before us the absolutely comprehensive ethical ideal of perfection for the whole universe, we can actually accomplish that ideal without or prior to his catastrophic return.”3 4 He kept talking about Christians’ “actual and complete blessedness,” reminding us that “they cannot be per- fectly blessed till bodies are free from the last evil consequence of sin, that is, death. They cannot be fully blessed till all of nature be recast with glory resplendent. In short, they cannot be fully blessed till ‘the regeneration of all things.’ “ 35 This is all true enough: thefullness does not come until the end of history. But the crucial observation here is Van Til’s systematic neglect of the concept ofprogressiue sanctz$ication, either personal or in- stitutional. He spoke of visible blessings for covenantal faithfulness only with respect to jinal sanctification — not in history, but beyond history at God’s final judgment. We seldom find cases where Van Til cheats or fudges intellectually, but here is one case where he did, and did so on a systematic, continuing basis. He deliberately confused the ethical issue by referring to the blessings and the ethical victory of Christians only with respect to the final, post-historical, post- second coming era. He disguised this systematic refusal to deal with progressive sanctification in history by contrasting the admittedly incomplete present with the fullness of the post-resurrection future.

In the Old Testament era, Van Til argued, there was con- siderable continuity between covenantal faithfulness and external blessings, but this is no longer the case in the New Testament era. He maintained that Christians cannot have legitimate hope in the earthly success of the gospel prior to the second coming of Christ in final judgment. Instead, he argued, Christians must content them- selves with looking forward to a post-historic “absolute future.”37 The amillennialist does not believe in a visible progressive manifestation of God’s kingdom (Christian civilization), except within a com- parative handful of small (and probably shrinking) congregations and within Christian families. “Negatively we may affirm that our hope for the future cannot be found chiefly in the possibility that as time goes on men will be more readily convinced of the reasonable- ness of our program. In fact we may expect the contrary of this.n38 With respect to a vision of the future, the amillennialist is basically a premillennialist without earthly hope. The best statement I have seen that reveals Van Til’s eschatology of paganism’s inevitable historical continuity (the historical victory of covenant-breakers) and Christianity’s inevitable historical discon- tinuity (the sudden, post-historical victory of covenant-keepers) is found in his collection of essays on Christian education. You could not ask for an eschatological statement any clearer than this: We maintain, in the first place, that the fruits of our labors will not appear in their full significance till after this life. And what is more, we maintain 36. I will discuss later why there can be, in theory, theonomic amillennialists and premillennialist. 37. Van Til, Ethics, p. 104. 38.

It sometimes happens that the spring is cold and wet and that in addition to all this a hailstorm sets back the crops. Yet to the great surprise of all the fall will bring an abundance of fi-uits. Now this is true in a much greater degree in the realm of spiritual things. In this world there is opposition from without and opposition from within while we build our program. Hailstorms descend upon us and cut all things level with the ground. There is very little in the way of fruitage that can be seen. Yet we know that when all the opposition of sin will be removed and the sunshine of the Son of Righteousness will shine upon it all the time, then there will be such fruitage as has never been seen in this world. 39 Van Til offered the Church this cosmic weather report: “We in- terrupt our regular programming with this emergency weather bulletin. This afternoon, Christians can expect wet, cold weather, followed by hailstones this evening. Tomorrow we will have more of the same, only worse. Sunny weather is predicted for next week, im- mediately following the end of the world. Details at eleven .“ Let us understand the nature of amillennialism. Insofar as eschatology refers to human history, amillennialism is postmillennialism for covenant-breakers. Covenant-breakers take dominion progressively in history. (Dispensational premillennialism is also postmillen- nialism for covenant-breakers, insofar as eschatology refers to the Christians who live and labor prior to Jesus’ physical second coming, the so-called Church Age. All their good works will be swallowed up during the great tribulation period, either immediately before Jesus returns — the post-tribulation position — or in the seven-year period which follows the “secret Rapture”: pre-tribulationism.) Postmillen- nialism is an inescapable concept. It is never a question of cultural triumph vs. no cultural triumph prior to Jesus’ second coming; it is a question of which kingdom~ cultural triumph. Ethical Neutrality in History? Van Til, as with premillennialists and amillennialists generally, argued that there is no reliable, predictable, statistically relevant ethical cause-and-effect relationship between covenanta.1 faithfulness and external, visible covenantal blessings, or between covenantal unfaithfulness and external, visible covenantal cursings. Van Til ac- 39.

But Van Til knew there can be no ethical neu- trality. His whole career was devoted to denying such neutrality in the field of philosophy. This, in fact, was his great intellectual contri- bution to the Church. Therefore, if we accept Van Til’s apologetic system, we know that any supposed ethical neutrality with respect to ethical cause and effect in history must be a myth. He maintained that the neutrality doctrine is always a cover for an anti-Christian worldview. But then so is neutrality regarding ethical cause and eject in his- toy. Jesus promised: “Verily I say unto you, There is no man that bath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s, But he shall re- ceive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life” (Mark 10:29-30).41 There is a positive relationship in history between covenantal faithfulness and external, visible blessings, although persecutions accompany the blessings. This positive relationship is self-consciously denied by traditional premillennialism and ami.llennialism.AZ What amillennialism and pre- millennialism implicitly and often explicitly assert is a negative relation- ship between covenantal faithfulness and external, visible blessings, and a Positive relationship between unfaithfulness and external, visible blessings. In other words, the righteous will supposedly become pro- 40. Van Til, Ethics, p. 104. 41. Obviously, disciples will not receive a hundred sets of biological mothers, or a hundred times as many biological children. What Jesus was promising us is this: as the gospel spreads, disinherited disciples will find that new converts will welcome them into their homes, and the economic assets of hundreds of families will be made available to them for the spread of the gospel. They will become members of many families covenantally as the triumphant Church grows in numbers. 42.

This was Van Til’s explicit argument in Common Grace (1954). God supposedly says to His eternal enemies, “I hate you so much, and My hatred of you is increasing so rapidly, that I will let you beat the stuffing out of My people, whom I love with increasing fervor as they increase in righteous self-knowledge .“ The ways of God are strange . . . if you are an amillennialist or a premillennialist. 43 The Doctrine of Ethical “Unevenness” Van Til spent his career preaching against natural law philoso- phy, yet he steadfastly refused to recommend the adoption of biblical law as the Christian alternative to natural law. He adopted a doc- trine of ethical cause and effect which, temporal~ speaking, is inher- ently pagan. This is strong language, but Van Til’s own arguments bear this out. In attacking modern apostate ethical theory, he wrote: “In the first place, it is said that the idea of ethics having anything to do with externals has been done away with in the New Testament. We are no longer considered morally impure when we are physically impure. Then, too, it is not a part of the New Testament teaching, as it was of the Old Testament teaching, that redemption has any- thing to do with the external world.”~ Yet he himself adopted a simi- lar view of ethical cause and effect in history – a view which in fact denied moral cause and effect in history. This is his doctrine of the his- torical unevenness of ethical causes and external effects: . . . according to all non-Christian ethics there is no relation at all between moral andj)hysical evil. There is thought to be a physical evil that is independ- ent of man which befalls man irrespective of his moral life. There is a sense in which this is true. We too believe that those on whom the tower of Siloam fell were no greater sinners than others. But on the other hand we do be- lieve that the fall of man has brought physical evil in the world. And be- cause we believe this we can also believe that a good moral man, who suffers physical evil, is not therefore necessarily at a final disadvantage in comparison with him who, though he suffers no physical evil, is morally corrupt. In other words, we have, as Christians, a longer range, the range 43. North, Dominion and Common Grace, p. 82. 44.

Non-Christians, on the other hand, have only the range of the pres- ent world and the present life of man to use as a standard. From this point of view it is impossible to view things otherwise than as absolutely uneven. Accordingly, all non-Christians must, in accordance with their assump- tions, maintain that the ethical life is necessarily individualistic. 45 Van Til opposed such pietistic individualism. He said that we Christians must get involved socially and politically. In this he was a true heir of Abraham Kuyper, the Prime Minister of the Nether- lands at the turn of the twentieth century, who was also a major theologian, the founder of a university, and the founder of several newspapers. ti Van Til warned against the temptation succumbed to by the premillennial fundamentalism of his day to ‘spend a great deal of their time in passive waiting instead of in active service. Another danger that lurks at a time of apostasy is that the few faith- ful ones give up the comprehensive ideal of the kingdom and limit themselves to the saving of individual SOUIS.”47 In short, he warned against ethical individualism. He understood that such individual- ism is a denial of covenant theology. Nevertheless, in view of his discussion of “uneven” ethical cause and effect in history, he viewed the external results of righteousness as random. He did not use such an obviously apostate term, but this is precisely what his doctrine of “unevenness” means. Yet he knew better. There is never randomness in history. There is always for- ward movement. Covenant-keepers and covenant-breakers work out in history the implications of their respective religious faiths. No, Van Til did not truly believe in ethical randomness; it was much worse than this. Van Til believed with all his heart that Satan and his followers will be triumphant in histoy. He therefore believed with all his heart that euil triumphs visib~ in histo~, and righteousness loses. He taught throughout his career that the principles of evil produce uisible power and uictoy, whereas the Principles of righteous living under God pTo- duce historical defeat. Thus, Van Til’s unique lapse into the myth of neutrality — his doctrine of ethical unevenness in history — proved to be as much a myth as ever. History is not neutral; one side or the other wins; one ethical system or the other produces victory; and 45. Ibid. , pp., 67-68. 46.

He made this plain: But when all the reprobate are epistemologically self-conscious, the crack of doom has come. The fully self-conscious reprobate will do all he can in every dimension to destroy the people of God. So while we seek with all our power to hasten the process of differentiation in every dimension we are yet thankful, on the other hand, for “the day of grace,” the day of undeveloped differentiation. Such tolerance as we receive on the part of the world is due to this fact that we live in the earlier, rather than in the later, stage of his- tory. And such influence on the public situation as we can effect, whether in society or in state, presupposes this undifferentiated stage of development. 4s Notice especially his words, “we are yet thankful, on the other hand, for ‘the day of gracej the day of undeveloped differentiation.” This is nothing short of a ghastly reworking of the idea of God’s grace. He knew it, too, which is why he puts the words the day of grme in quota- tion marks. He knew that it is the opposite of grace that Christians are not fully self-conscious epistemologicall y, and more to the point, ethical~. But his amillennialism had a stranglehold on his theory of ethics. He viewed today’s earlier so-called “day of grace” as a day in which covenant-breakers are also not fully self-conscious, and this, in the amillennialist’s universe of progressive Church impotence and progressive humanist power, is a good thing for covenant-keepers in an external, cultural sense. In short, as time goes on, covenant- breakers retain control – Satan’s doctrine of “squatter’s rights”4 g – and steadily consolidate their hold over world civilization as they be- come more consistent with their religion, while covenant-keepers fail to gain or lose control over civilization because they become more consistent with their religion. This is the ethical outlook of both premillen- nialism and amillennialism. Ethics is tied to eschatology. If your eschatology is incorrect, your ethics will be incorrect if your world- view is internally consistent. To teach that the progress of the gospel in history is not progressive, i.e., that the gospel does not lead to worldwide dominion by covenant-keepers, is to teach that ethical cause and e&ect in history is perverse, testifying not to a God who keeps His promises in histo~ but rather to a god who breaks them. 48.

Our eschatology is deeply influenced by our view of biblical law and its effects in his- tory. It is not this or that rival interpretation of this or that prophetic Bible passage that is the primary focus of our concern. It is rather the overall view held by our eschatological opponents regarding the culture-losing efects of biblical law in histo~ which draws our fire. Their view of history is not neutral; it is not random; and it surely is not “even .“ It is perverse: a belief that God will not bless covenant-keeping in history, and will not curse covenant-breaking. The Supposed Perversi~ of HistoV With respect to ethical cause and effect in history, Van Til’s sys- tem appears to defend a radical discontinuity between ethics and do- minion in history. History, he insists, is ethically “uneven. ” But this seeming discontinuity is an illusion. There is continuity in Van Til’s view of history: the visible triumph of evil forces. There is ethical cause and effect in Van Til’s amillennial scheme: evil triumphs visibly in history, while righteousness visibly loses. Van Til adopted this radically anti-covenantal view of ethical cause and effect in history because such a view was more consistent with his amillennial theology. Why do I say that his view was anti- covenantal? Because the sanctions of Old Testament law are, contrary to Van Til, still in operation in the New Testament era, and still “even” in the long run with respect to the consequences of ethical be- havior. Covenant theology, to be consistent, must affirm the long- term continuity in history between obedience to God and God’s ex- ternal rewards. It must take seriously the Book of Job, which teaches that hard times and external defeat can afflict the righteous man temporarily, but seldom for a lifetime (unless his society has come under God’s visible, covenantal punishment). “So the L ORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning . . .” (Job 42 :12a). History is covenantal. Yet Van Til actually begins with the Book of Job to defend his case for judicial “unevenness” in history! We have already adverted to Job when first discussing this question of the future. To a large extent the difficulty that Job had was that he was not able to see things at long range. He knew that righteousness, holiness and"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Hayway Covenant Ethics 145 blessedness belong together, On this point he was right, but the difficulty was that he could not see that they could be temporarily separated from each other. In order for Job to see the absolute ideal at all, he had to see it in a form that came very close to him. Then, when his blessedness was taken away from him, he only slowly began to see that there was a future in which matters would be rectified. SO Where did Job go wrong? !’He was not able to see things at long range.” He did not see that covenant-keeping and external cove- nantal blessings “could be temporarily separated from each other.” This is admitted by all orthodox Christians; it is indeed a basic teaching of the Book of Job. (The book’s primary message is the ab- solute sovereignty of God: point one of the biblical covenant model. ) So, what is Van Til’s real point? Though Van Til writes “temporar- ily,” he really means temporal~. When Van Til said “temporarily sepa- rated,” he really meant separated throughout pre-second-coming histoy, as we have seen. He said that when it comes to the cause-and-effect re- lationship between righteousness and visible blessedness, “the one may be far ahead of the other.”51 By “far ahead,” he means inside histwy, and his implicit meaning of “far behind” is b~ond histoy (after the final judgment). He simply ignored James 5:11 on Job’s earthly career. Van Til refused to use words that would have revealed more plainly what he really believed about covenantal history. As to why he refused, I can only speculate. I suspect that the main reason was that he did not want his readers to think that running through his en- tire ethical system, and therefore his entire philosophical system, was his eschatology, even though it really did. He always insisted that covenant-keeping and covenant-breaking ultimately govern philosophy, but what he could not bring himself to admit was that they also govern history. Amillennialism reverses the cause-and- effect relationship described in Deuteronomy 28. Van Til always avoided mentioning his eschatological preference for amillennialism. He seldom mentioned the dread word “eschatology,” and never, ever used words like “postmillennialism” or “amillennialism. ” It was as if he believed that he could be eschatologically neutral when writing about philosophy and ethics. This was a strange tactic for a man who denied neutrality in any area of thought and life. The fact is, his mind-set was established by his Dutch amillennial heritage, and he 50.

There was not much visible positive feedback in his intellectual ministry. He could not have expected much, either, given his view of the future. His own eschatological pessimism may have been responsible for this lack of converts. His work is being ex- tended to a broader Christian audience primarily through his most vocal followers, the “dreaded” Christian Reconstructionists, who do not agree with either his amillennialism or his social antinomianism. The old political slogan holds true: “You can’t beat something with nothing.” You cannot defeat humanism’s natural law theory with a halfway covenant theology of judicial “unevenness” in history. “Even” Sanctions: Tools of Evangelism In order to make all this so clear that nobody can miss what I am saying, let me say this: I am arguing for the continuing evangelical significance of God’s visible covenantal sanctions in history. 53 I am arguing that the evangelical testimony of historical sanctions that was available to the nations round about ancient Israel is still in opera- tion (Deut. 28). I am arguing that the existence of these covenantal sanctions in history still serves to persuade individuals of the inher- ent integrity of God’s law, just as they did in Moses’ day: “Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the L ORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it. Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and under- standing people. For what nation is there so great, who bath God so nigh unto them, as the L ORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for? And what nation is there so great, that bath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?” (Deut. 4:5-8). I am arguing that amillennialism in general and Van Til’s amillennialism in particular has denied the New Testa- ment continuation of this evangelical testimony. 52. Because premillennialism has an identical view of God’s sanctions in history prior to Christ’s second coming, and because modern Calvinistic postmillennialism was developed by Rushdoony, who was Van Til’s intellectual disciple, no one ever chal- lenged Van Til by calling attention to the extent to which his eschatology governed his whole system. By the time I figured out what he had done, he was too old to interact. 53. Ray R. Sutton, That You May Prosper, ch. 4."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Hal&ay Covenant Ethics 147 To deny this continuing testimony, non-theonomic amillennial- ists inescapably remove a major tool of dominion in history: the tes- timony of evidence favoring the international spread of the gospel. They are forced to argue that this strong apologetic evidence of God and His covenant was available in the Old Testament era, but God has abandoned this tool of evangelism in the New Testament era. The non-theonomic amillenniali~t implicitly assumes that for some unstated reason, God has abandoned the strong witness that out- ward covenantal success brings to the case for the gospel in history. Christian Reconstructionists assert that this covenantal tool of evangelism is still operating, and that it still impresses lost sinners. We affirm the long-term %venness” of God’s covenant sanctions – bless- ings and cursings — in history. We affirm that ethical cause and effect is sufficiently “even” over time so that lost sinners can recognize the dMerence between the histotial results of covenant-keeping and covenant- breaking, and that lost sinners will be impressed by the righteousness of the terms of the covenant. They will see that God’s sanctions of blessings and cursings do operate in history. They may well prefer to deny the “evenness” of God’s covenant sanctions in history. After all, Van Til did and Meredith G. Kline does. To do this, however, they will increasingly seek to repress mentally this visible testimony of God, to hold back the truth in unrighteousness (Rem. 1:18).54 Never- theless, they will inevitably be confronted with the reality of God’s sanctions in history. They cannot escape it. This testimony is no less real and no less effective in the New Testament era than it was in the Old Testament era. In fact, it is more effective, because the Holy Spirit has come, and the gospel is now a worldwide phenomenon. Meredith G. Kline vs. God’s Historical Sanctions If you preach that adherence to biblical law produces “positive feedback,” both personally and culturally, and also that disobeying it produces “negative feedback,” both personally and culturally, then you are preaching the inevitable expansion of Christian civilization and the inevitable defeat of satanic civilization. You are preaching the progressive JulJllment of the dominion covenant. In short, you are preach- ing postmillennial Christian Reconstruction. Only if you deny that there is any long-term sustainable relationship between external cov- 54.

Kline – can you escape from the dominical im- plications of biblical law. Kline says that any connection between blessings and covenant- keeping is, humanly speaking, random. “And meanwhile it [the common grace order] must run its course within the uncertainties of the mutually conditioning principles of common grace and common curse, prosperity and adversity being experienced in a manner largely unpredictable because of the inscrutable sovereignty of the divine will that dispenses them in mysterious ways.”55 Largely unpredictable? Dr. Kline has obviously never considered just why it is that life insurance premiums and health insurance premiums are cheaper in Christianity-influenced societies than in pagan societies. Apparently, the blessings of long life that are promised in the Bible are sufficiently non-random and predictable that statisticians who advise insurance companies can detect statistically relevant differ- ences between societies. What Kline is arguing is that the testimony of God’s law and cov- enant sanctions in history was scrapped by God after the fall of Jeru- salem in A.D. 70. The visible sanctions of God do not operate in the era of the Church. Ethical cause and effect in culture is random. In this sense, Kline is a faithful disciple of Van Til. He holds the same eschatology. He holds the same view of common grace. But like Van Til’s viewpoint, Kline’s is also not entirely forthright. Kline argues for the unpredictable nature of ethical cause and effect in New Testa- ment history; Van Til argues for “unevenness. ” But in fact both of them are really defenders of ethical Perver+ in histo~, not random- ness. They view the Church as if it were a progressively besieged outpost of faith in a world of hostile Indians. Not only that, but the Indians have stolen most of the repeating rifles from the Christians. Worse; they have even stolen the production techniques, and now manufacture top quality rifles and ammunition. Meanwhile, the Christians are holed up in their tiny fortresses, praying for the mi- raculous arrival of Col. Jesus and His angelic troops. I do not deny that there will be a rebellion at the last day, and that it will resemble this description (Rev. 20:9-10). But there will be this crucial difference: the rebels will be rebelling against a visibly 55. Meredith G.

They will be rebelling against a superior degree of testimony regarding the effectiveness and reliability of God’s covenantal sanctions in history. Most impor- tant, they will not be allowed to inflict visible defeat on the Church before Christ forever silences them in final judgment. It is theoretically possible for a consistent Christian Reconstruc- tionist to argue that there will steadily be a religious falling away in history that will be comparable to Israel’s falling away in the days of Jesus. But it would not be possible for a Christian Reconstructionist to argue that this falling away will be accompanied by the steady re- placement of Christian-run institutions by pagans. This would be a denial of God’s covenant sanctions in history. This is why most Christian Reconstructionists are postmillennialist. They do n~t be- lieve that God’s covenant sanctions can or will fail in history, and they also do not believe that it is possible in the long run for a minor- ity of Christians to run the social order on a biblical basis in a world that has abandoned faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ. Why do most Christian Reconstructionists believe that there will not be this falling away until the very end of the millennial era, just before the second coming of Christ? Because most Christian Reconstruc- tionists have a ve~ high uiew of the historical effectiveness of the work of the Ho@ Spirit. Premillennialist argue that Jesus must be present bodily in order to usher in His earthly kingdom (Christian civilization). So, for that matter, do amillennialists; they just say that because He will not return bodily to set up His earthly kingdom until He returns at the final judgment, there will never be a pre-final judgment earthly kingdom (Christian civilization). In contrast to these culturally pessimistic views, most Christian Reconstructionists believe that today’s presence of the Holy Spirit is sufficient to empower Christians to establish, as Christ’s ecclesiasti- cal “body” and also as His personal representatives and am- bassadors, a self-consciously Christian civilization. We must never forget that Jesus departedfrom this world bodi~ in order that the Ho~ Spirit might come. He spoke of this as an advantage to the Church. “Never- theless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you” (John 16:7). Understand what this means. Because Jesus Chn”st is not bodi~ present in this world of sin, the Church is far better of. Because He is not present, the Church has far greater power.

Christian Reconstruc- tionists accept Christ’s words at face value — just not “face to face” value. He does not have to tell us this face to face for us to believe Him. It is sufficient that we read it in His written Word. Why, then, are amillennialists and premillennialist so adamant that the gospel will fail to transform world civilization as time prog- resses? Why do ‘they believe that Jesus Christ needs to be bodily present in this sinful world in order for it to be conformed progres- sively to the image of the Son of God? It is surely not necessary for Jesus to be present bodily for individual Christians to be trans- formed in this way (i.e., progressive Personal sanctification). It is also not necessary for Jesus to be present bodily for Christian families to be transformed in this way (i.e., progressive familial sanctification). ‘ It is not necessary for Jesus to be present bodily for the Christian Church to be transformed in this way (i.e., progressive ecclesiastical sanctification). So, why is it necessary that Jesus be bodily present in order for world civilization to be transformed in this way (i. e., pro- gressive cultural sanctification)? Why is the Holy Spirit’s presence sufficient to produce the first three forms of progressive sanctifica- tion, but not the fourth? Empowering by the Spirit Greg Bahnsen has argued repeatedly that what distinguishes bib- lical law in the New Testament era from the Old Covenant era is the vastly greater empowering of Christians by the Holy Spirit to obey the law. 56 I agree entirely with this argument. The Spirit’s empower- ing is a fundamental distinction between the two covenantal periods. It is also interesting to note that the only broad-based acceptance of the theonomic position today is taking place in charismatic circles – circles in which the positive power of the Holy Spirit is stressed. But this greater empowering by the Spirit must be made manifest in his- tory if it is to be distinguished from the repeated failure of believers in the Old Covenant era to stay in the “positive feedback” mode: blessings . . . greater faith . . . greater blessings, etc. It is this 56.

Bahnsen has argued forcefully that any discussion of the expan- sion of God’s kingdom must include a discussion of the visible mani- festations of God’s kingdom in history. To spe~ of the kingdom of God without being able to point to its expansion of influence outside the narrow confines of the institutional Church is misleading. 58 This argument also is correct. But what of a parallel argument? If we were to argue that the greater empowering of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament era is only a kind of theoretical backdrop to history, and therefore biblical law will not be widely preached and obeyed in this pre-final-judgment age (which is the amillennialist argument), then we would really be abandoning the whole idea of the Holy Spirit’s empowering of Chris- tians and Christian society in history. It would be an argument anal- ogous to the kingdom arguments of the amillennialist: “Yes, God has a kingdom, and Christians are part of it, and it is a victorious king- dom; nevertheless, there are no progressively visible signs of the king or His kingdom, and Christians will be increasingly defeated in history.” Similarly, “Yes, the Spirit empowers Christians to obey bib- lical law; however, they will not adopt or obey biblical law in history.” Will the progressive manifestation of the fruits of obeying bibli- cal law also be strictly internal? If so, then what has happened to the positive feedback aspect of covenant law? What has happened to em- powering by the Holy Spirit? I prefer to argue that the greater empowering by the Holy Spirit for God’s people to obey and enforce biblical law is what invalidates the implicit amillennialist position regarding the ineffectiveness of biblical law in New Testament times. If Christians obey it, then the positive feedback process of external, visible Christian culture is inevita- ble; it is part of the theonomic aspect of the creation: “from victory unto victory.” If some segments of the Church refuse to obey it, then 57.

Their place will be taken by those Christian churches that obey God’s laws, and that will therefore experience the covenant’s exter- nal blessings. These churches will spread the gospel more effectively as a result. This is the positive feedback aspect of biblical law. Again, let me stress that I am not saying that the external success of God’s civilization automatically or necessarily converts sinners in- ward~ to faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ. Men are not saved by law or by the historical sanctions of the law. What I am saying is that the defiant sinner in the millennial future will reject the gospel in the face of even more visible testimony to the historical benefits of saving faith. He will suffer even greater quantities of eternal coal on his resurrected head (Rem. 12: 20). Kline attacked both of Bahnsen’s recommended doctrines – bib- lical law and postmillennialism – in his critique of TJzeonomy.59 Kline rejects the idea of a New Testament covenantal law-order, and he also rejects postmillennialism. Kline and his fellow amillennialists are consistent in their rejection of both biblical law and postmillennialism. Postmillennialists should be equally consistent in linking the two positions. We must argue covenantally, and this necessarily involves the question of the positive feedback of external covenantal blessings and the Church’s empowering by the Holy Spirit. If we accept the possibility of a defense of God’s law that rejects the historic inevitability of the long-term cultural expansion of Christian domin- ion through the covenant’s positive feedback, then we face a major problem, the one Bahnsen’s theory of the empowering by the Spirit has raised: how to explain the dz~erence between the New Testament Church and Old Testament Israel. If the Christian Church fails to build the visi- ble kingdom (Christian civilization) by means of biblical law and the power of the gospel, despite the resurrection of Christ and the pres- ence of the Holy Spirit, then what kind of religion are we preaching? Why is the Church a significant improvement culturally and socially over Old Testament Israel? What does such a theology say about the gospel? What kind of power does the gospel offer men for the overcoming of the effects of sin in history? Is Satan’s one-time success in tempting Adam never going to be overcome in history?

And, just for the record, let me ask another question: When in history will we see the fulfillment of the promise of Isaiah 32, when churls will no longer be called liberal, generous people will no longer be called churls, and (presumably) the historic defeat of the Church will no longer be called the victory of God’s kingdom? Preaching External DeJeat Amillennialists, by preaching eschatological impotence culturally, thereby immerse themselves in quicksand – the quicksand of social antinomianism. Some sands are quicker than others. Eventually, they swallow up anyone so foolish as to try to walk through them. Social antinomianism leads into the pits of cultural impotence and retreat. No one wants to risk everything he owns, including his life, in a bat- tle that his commander says will not be won. Only a few diehard souls will attempt it. You can build a ghetto with such a theology; you cannot build a civilization. Amil.lennial Calvinists will continue to be plagued by Dooyeweerd- ians, neo-Dooyeweerdians, mystics, liberation theologians, natural- law compromisers, and antinomians of all sorts until they finally aban- don their amillennial eschatology. Furthermore, biblical law must also be preached. It must be seen as the tool of cultural reconstruction. It must be seen as operating today, in New Testament times. It must be seen that there is a necessary relationship between covenantal faith- fulness and obedience to God’s revealed law – that without obedience there is no faithfulness, no matter how emotional believers may be- come, or how sweet the gospel tastes (for a while). Furthermore, there are external blessings that follow covenantal obedience to God’s law-order.

Dutch amillennialists and American fundamentalists deny a covenantal view of ethics – a long- run, historically manifested “evenness” between obedience to God’s law and external blessings (Deut. 28:1-14). Thus, the failure of the Reformed Dutch-Americans to persuade American fundamentalists to abandon the latter group’s individualistic ethics is closely related to amillennialism’s necessary doctrine of ethical “unevenness”: the supposed cultural discontinuity in New Testament times between external obedience and visible reward. To the extent that the amil- lennialist adopts this near-pagan doctrine of temporal unevenness (ethical futurism), to that extent he becomes impotent to challenge both humanism’s individualistic ethics and fundamentalism’s indi- vidualistic ethics. But no one can live without some sort of social and cultural con- tinuity. Social antinomianism unquestionably produces individ- ualism, for it denies the applicability of God’s covenant promises to New Testament society; therefore, some other doctrine or outlook must offset individualism in order to maintain cultural cohesion. Historically, there have been many rivals to the continuity of cove- nantalism, with its powerful doctrine of progressive cultural sanctifi- cation: for example, political power, racial purity, linguistic affinity, national custom, membership in a “vanguard” of some sort, or mem- bership in a secret society. The descendants of mid-nineteenth cen- tury Dutch immigrants adopted a national-linguistic alternative in order to establish cultural continuity (“evenness”). This has led to the creation of Dutch enclaves in both Canada and the United States, meaning the creation of ghettoes, very often rural ghettoes.

The pessi- millennialist denies that there will be a huge harvest of souls in the future; this in fact is the meaning of pessimillennialism. On what basis could a Christian Reconstructionist argue this way? First, a Calvinist Christian Reconstructionist could argue that God will not direct His Spirit to compel the conversion of large numbers of peo- ple. God could compel this, but He chooses not to. Second, an Ar- minian argues that people will always be able to reject the offer of God’s saving grace, i.e., he denies the sovereignty of God in electing sinners to salvation. He therefore denies the doctrines of irresistible grace and effectual calling. A pessimillennial Christian Reconstruc- tionist, Calvinist or Arminian,’3 affirms that men will reject the gos- pel despite the visible sanctions of God in history. The Calvinist says that this rejection was predestined by God, and He has revealed this grim future to us; the Arminian says that it was not predestined, but it was foreknown by God, and He has revealed this grim future to us. What no Christian Reconstructionist should ever argue is this: that historical sanctions alone will bring worldwide salvation. Men are not saved by law or by judicial sanctions; they are not saved by the testimony of law and the law’s visible sanctions. They are saved only by the work of the Holy Spirit. But what every Christian Reconstructionist must affirm is this: for men to reject God’s message of eternal salvation, they will have to reject progressiue~ clear and progressiue~ impressive testimony regarding the authority of God, God’s revealed law, and the sanctions of God in histo~. Rebels will have to reject all five points of the covenant. We dare not argue that the revelation of God decreases in intensity and clarity over history.

He must also affirm that most men will choose to accept the progressively visible failure and looming destruction that God brings in history to covenant-breakers. We know that all those who hate God love death (Prov. 8:36). Therefore, a consistent Christian Reconstructionist can hold to a non-victorious eschatolo~. But he must argue that the reason for this failure of the gospel message in history is the result of men’s rejection of an ever-clearer, ever-more condemning visible testimony to the reality and reliability of God’s law and its sanctions in history. w Anyone who is a full-scale theonomist must affirm both the con- tinuing moral validity of Old Testament law and the continuing sanctions of God in history. Biblical law does not come to man apart from historical sanctions: blessings and cursings. Deuteronomy 28 is still binding in history. Thus, visible, external covenantal victory for those who obey God’s law is inevitable. Nevertheless, this does not prove that a worldwide conversion to saving faith is inevitable. Therefore, the consistent theonomic pessimillennialist has to adopt a view of theocracy which is inherently elitist spiritually. He is arguing that the spiritually lost will voluntarily allow biblical law to be en- forced culturally, perhaps for the sake of receiving the external bless- ings and avoiding the external cursings, even though they will not really possess eternally saving faith in the Son of God. This is a theologically questionable view. I have argued in Chapter 6 of Dominion and Common Grace that a society’s external adherence to God’s law requires saving faith for most members of that society. Even for the sake of external benefits, covenant- breakers cannot indefinitely adhere to God’s external covenant stan- dards. They cannot tolerate the testimony of God’s sovereignty in their midst. They must eventually rebel. They do rebel at the last day (Rev. 20:9-10). Thus, theonomic postmillennialists argue that long-term cultural faithfulness to God’s covenant law can only be sustained by the continuing work of God’s Holy Spirit in the hearts of men. Large numbers of people will have to be brought to eternally saving faith in order to sustain a worldwide holy commonwealth. It 64.

We are calling for a bottom-up transformation of society. We are calling, in short, for democratic theocracy– the social, cultural, and (last of all) political product of a majority of eternally saved people.’5 The reason why theonomists are continually accused of wanting to set up a “dictatorship by the saints” is because our critics reason in terms of premillennialism or amillennialism. They simply refuse to take seriously our defense of postmillennialism. They cannot im- agine a future society in which a majority of people will voluntarily agree to be governed in every area of life in terms of the comprehen- sive covenants of God. They cannot imagine such a move of the Holy Spirit. So, when they read that we want to see the whole world run in terms of God’s law, they inevitably think, “international elitist tyranny.” Over and over, we affirm our faith in the conversion of the world’s masses to faith in Christ, but our critics refuse to listen. They are judicially deaf: “hearing they hear not, neither do they under- stand” (Matt. 13:13 b). So, when people ask me, “Can a person be a Christian Recon- structionist without being a postmillennialist?” I answer yes. But to be a consistent theonomic pessimillennialist, he has to adopt a view of the future that most people find even more difficult to accept than mine: a world in which the vast majority of people are covenant- breakers, a world in which the law’s historical sanctions are still being applied by God, and in which a dwindling elite of saints rule over a growing though weakened army of God-haters. This sounds like a top-down theocracy to me. I do not think such a theocracy can survive the test of time. Anti-elitism is another reason why the vast majority of Christian Reconstructionists are also postmillennial. They reject the vision and the likelihood of a top-down theocracy. It is conceivable over the short run, but it is not conceivable over the long run. We postmillennial Christian Reconstructionists are con- cerned about the long run.

Antinomianism therefore leads directly to the concept of political pluralism. Political pluralism is part of an overall philosophy of life. It is not simply some neutral political solution to a series of technical political problems. Ideas have consequences, and these consequences are fre- quently not perceived by those who will suffer them. I have said that antinomianism, biblically defined, leads to political pluralism. Political pluralism has consequences. It leads directly to polytheism: muny moral law-orders; therefore, many gods. Polytheism (all gods are equal) leads to relativism (all moral codes are equal); relativism leads to humanism (man makes his own laws); and humanism leads to statism (the State best represents mankind as the pinnacle of power).

Ethical futurism must be based on the biblical concept of three- fold sanctification: definitive (Christ’s resurrection), progressive (his- tory), and final (final judgment). To deny that the process of pro- gressive sanctification applies historically to institutions as well as to individual Christians is to remove or at least cripple the impulse to dominion. This is why we must affirm postmillennialism: not only because it is logically correct, or more consistent than other eschato- logical system;, or less compromising in its handling of the Bible’s prophetic texts, but also because postmillennialism is alone consistent with the Bible’s view of ethical cause and efect in history. It preaches God’s covenantal sanctions as the basis of long-term dominion. Ethics should be our primary motivation rather than eschatol- ogy. Obeying God should be more important motivationally than collecting temporal rewards. God is sovereign, not man. This is why I believe so strongly that one’s eschatologv grows out of his view of ethical cause and eflect in histoy.

We must affirm historical sanctions in order to affirm the covenant. We must affirm whole covenant theolo+y.

His amil- lennialism undermined his ethical system, and this inevitably called into question his life’s work: the destruction of halfway covenant phi- losophy. He expected his followers to enter the historical battle needlessly ill-equipped: to fight as God’s earthly representatives against Satan’s earthly representatives, but without God’s covenant sanctions in history. He called them to fight something (Satan’s exist- ing cultural strongholds) with nothing (a worldview that denies God’s covenant sanctions in history). That very few people have heeded Van Til’s call to join him in his intellectual battle should not be surprising; they implicitly recognize that this battle is far more than merely intellectual. It is at bottom ethical, and therefore it in- volves a personal confrontation in every area of life. To enter such a battle without faith in God’s covenant sanctions in history is the theological equivalent of joining a squad of Japanese kamikaze pilots 72. While it is true that God might convert the whole world to Christianity, with- out a uniquely Christian law-order, and without covenant sanctions, there would be no fundamental change in the nature of world culture. The world’s institutions would be operated just as they are now: by standards that are not biblical. This is why the older postmillennialism of Princeton Theological Seminary, like the post- millennialism of Jonathan Edwards, was uncompelling intellectually and theologi- cally.

No matter how enthusiastically y you shout “Banzai!” you know where things are headed. Van Til affirmed forthrightly only the first of the covenant’s five points: the transcendence of God. He keyed his philosophy to this crucial doctrine: the Creator-creature distinction. This is why he revolutionized Christian apologetics. But he adopted a false doctrine of temporal succession: the progressive triumph of Satan’s represen- tatives in history. Thus, he had the second point of the covenant in- correct: representationlhierarchy. While he believed in a hierar- chical approach to epistemology — man’s thinking God’s thoughts after Him — he fervently believed that Satan’s representatives can successfully run the world throughout history, i.e. , successfully maintain political and cultural power. But how can they do this, since they deny God’s revealed law (point three), thereby placing themselves under God’s negative sanctions in history (point four)? Van Til did not believe in God’s covenant sanctions in history, and therefore he could not affirm the power and historical authority of biblical law, a law-order that cannot be separated from God’s histori- cal sanctions. Thus, Van Til laid the intellectual foundations for the acceptance of political pluralism: the doctrine that God is represented politically throughout history by those who refuse to affirm His absolute sover- eignty, His comprehensive (multi-institutional) theocratic rule, His revealed law, His sanctions in history, and the progressive triumph of His kingdom in history. This means that he refused to abandon ethical pluralism in the field of social ethics. Nevertheless, such a view of political and ethical pluralism is inextricably tied to the doc- trine of natural law or evolutionary law, i.e., tied to the autonomy of man. Yet he denied this doctrine throughout his career. Van Til was a classic victim of intellectual schizophrenia, a schizophrenia pro- duced by his amillennialism. He got point five of the covenant wrong, and points two through four toppled, too. He always said that there is no neutrality in thought or life, yet he constructed his apologetic system as though there could be escha- tological neutrality. His denomination affirms that there must be es- chatological neutrality organizationall y. But in Van Til’s case, this cloak of eschatological neutrality was a cover for a radical pessimism regarding the earthly future of the gospel, the Church, and Christian culture.

As part of his view of creation he defended the absolute providence of God. He was strong on point one of the cove- nant, and because of this, his apologetic method can legitimate y be said to have launched the Christian Reconstruction movement. But this is true only with regard to his defense of point one. His views re- garding the other four points, if accepted, would undermine the Reconstructionist position. Professor Meredith G. Kline has seen this more clearly than most of our critics. What saved Van Til’s system could not save the system of his for- mer student, Francis Schaeffer. Schaeffer believed in but did not em- phasize in his writings either predestination or special creation. He was a “closet Calvinist” in his published writings. His system was therefore even more the victim of halfway covenant philosophy. He system was even more vulnerable to the myth of political pluralism.

The Bible Presbyterians in 1938 adopted an anti-alcohol platform, a tra- ditional fundamentalist position. 10 In 1937, at its first meeting, the newly assembled group vowed to amend the Westminster standards ‘in any particular in which the premillennial teaching of the Scrip- tures may be held to be obscured.”11 This was done in 1938, when they rewrote the Westminster Confession’s section on eschatology. 12 Schaeffer served in 1948 as Moderator of the General Synod of McIntire’s Bible Presbyterian Church in 1948, the year after his first visit to Europe. 13 He later joined the exodus from McIntire’s church to forma new “Columbus Synod” in 1956, which merged in 1965 with the Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Synod, to form the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod. 14 Seventeen years later, this small denomination merged with the Presbyterian Church in America, the evangelical denomination that had sepa- rated from the liberal Southern Presbyterian Church. He was still alive when this merger took place, and he ended his life as a Presby- terian pastor in an officially Calvinistic denomination. In short, Rev. Schaeffer remained a Calvinist and premillennial- ist, although the sharp edges of his earlier fundamentalism faded from his theology over time. “As early as 1942 ,“ writes one Church historian, “Francis Schaeffer laid emphasis on the Church’s strong and definite doctrinal basis in contrast to the doctrinal weakness and vagueness of modernist and fundamentalist alike.” 15 Yet the fact of 9.

Very few of Francis Schaeffer’s followers have known what he really believed theologi- cally, or what his oath of ministerial office affirms (The Westminster Confession of Faith and its Larger and Shorter Catechisms). For ex- ample, Rev. Schaeffer took a public oath as a Presbyterian minister that he believed the following doctrines regarding personal salvation: Man, by his fall into a state of sin, bath wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation: so as, a natural man, being altogether averse from that good, and dead in sin, is not able, by his own strength, to convert himself, or to prepare himself thereunto. 16 All those whom God bath predestinated unto life, and those only, He is pleased, in His appointed and accepted time, effectually to call, by His Word and Spirit, out of that state of sin and death, in which they are by nature to grace and salvation, by Jesus Christ; . . . This effectual call is of God’s free and special grace alone, not from any thing at all foreseen in man, who is altogether passive therein, until, being quickened and renewed by the Holy Spirit, he is thereby enabled to answer this call, and to embrace the grace offered and conveyed in it. 17 There is little doubt that the vast majority of those who have pur- chased his books are unaware that he believed these classic Calvinist doctrines, nor do they share such beliefs. This is part of the problem in dealing with Rev. Schaeffer and his intellectual legacy: he system- atically hid so many of his opinions from his readers. Why The Silence? I cannot recall a single instance in his (misleadingly titled) Con-z- plete Works in which he mentions, let alone defends, his own five- point Calvinism 18 or his ecclesiastical connections. His readers are given no indication that his intellectual background was deeply rooted in the Calvinistic doctrine of predestination. 19 His close asso- 16.

Carl McIntire was concealed entirely in his wife’s two (or possibly three) ZO biographies, which were expressly written for a broadly Arminian (“free will”) evangelical audience. Few peo- ple know that McIntire’s Independent Board for Foreign Presbyter- ian Missions sent Rev. Schaeffer to Switzerland in 1947. I know of nothing in print which clearly and without Mrs. Schaeffer’s “pre-1950 fog” discusses his life, church connections, theology, and intellectual development. When asked in 1968, Where did your husband get all this?” Mrs. Schaeffer offered a long, rambling disquisition about his discussions with “existentialists, logical positivists, Hindus, Buddhists, liberal Protestants, liberal Roman Catholics, Reformed Jews and atheistic Jews, Muslims, members of occult cults, and people of a wide variety of religions and philosophies, as well as atheists of a va- riety of types.” This went on for two pages. zl What she and he both refused to mention throughout their mutual career were the sources of his theology rather than his intellectual targets. Reading Mrs. Schaeffer’s books gives the reader the impression that Francis Schaeffer the philosopher-critic appeared mysteriously one afternoon after a walk in the Swiss Alps. That this remarkable transformation ap- peared after a long struggle with (and rejection of) Cornelius Van Til’s rigorously presuppositional apologetics and Carl McIntire’s rig- orously personal ecclesiastics is nowhere discussed. Why the Criticism? My essay on Rev. Schaeffer is mostly critical. I believe that he gave away far too much ground to the humanists and liberals who were the targets of his critiques. I believe that his apologetic ap- proach, like Cornelius Van Til’s, was deeply compromised by anti- nomianism and by eschatological pessimism. To prove my case, I have had to take a critical stand against him. This is a one-sided, specialized essay, not a well-rounded assessment of his personal min- istry overall. I believe that on the whole, he (like Van Til) fought the good evangelical fight, given his self-imposed theological handicaps, his lack of advanced formal academic training beyond seminary, and his geographical isolation in Switzerland. (To some extent, all three were advantages: they kept him out of the intellectual] y debilitating clutches of the academic compromisers who control the humanities 20.

Finally, he did elevate the terms of evangelical intellec- tual discourse from 1968 until his death. My disagreement with Rev. Schaeffer centers on the fact that he did not go far enough down the con frontational road. He waffled on key issues. He operated a halfway house intellectual ministry, with”all the liabilities associated with any ideologically middle-of-the-road operation. He did, how- ever, sell over two million books. None of his published critics can match that performance, including me. I am comparing him to what he could have been, had he remained more faithful to the older Puritan standards of the Westminster Con- fession of Faith that he affirmed at his ordination. I am comparing him to what he might have been had he taken the Old Testament case laws more seriously and the earthly future of Christianity more seriously. I am comparing him to what he should have been had he thoroughly abandoned the myth of neutrality that he publicly attacked, and had he really adopted the presuppositional apologetic approach that he sometimes claimed that he accepted. Most of all, I am comparing him to what we needed him to be, had he turned away from the political pluralism that he adhered to. Pluralism’s moral foundation is relativism, which he forthrightly warned against — a warning which has outraged his neo-evangelical academic critics. But compared to Hal Lindsey, he was a breath of fresh air. Compared to Robert Schuller, he was a theological life-support sys- tem. Compared to Tony Campolo, he was the Apostle Paul. From Apologetics to Social Theory In the early 1970’s, Van Til issued a mimeographed collection of letters that he had written to Schaeffer personally from 1967 on. This devastating, 54-page, single-spaced critique of Schaeffer’s halfway house philosophical defense of Christianity was titled simply, The Apologetic Methodology of Francis A. Schaefer. It exposed the extent to 22. See my Foreword to Ian Hedge, Baptized InJation: A Critique of “Chrzstian” Kcynesianism (Tyler, Texas: Institute for Christian Economics, 1986). 23.

Van Til argued that Schaeffer did not begin with the Bible as the self-attesting Word of God, with the Trinity, the providence of God, and the creation as the necessary presuppose- ‘ tions for all human thought. In short, he did not start with Van Til’s version of presuppositionalism, a rigorous and uncompromising pre- suppositionalism that teaches that there is on~ one point of contact be- tween the covenant-breaker and the covenant-keeper: the image of God in man. 24 Man’s logic is fallen; thus, there is therefore no logically neutral common ground. Whatever logic the covenant-breaker possesses is based on stolen presuppositions 25 – logic that he abandons as soon as he sees clearly that it points to the God of the Bible. Instead, he al- ways worships the creature rather than the Creator (Rem. 1:18-22). Schaeffer did not believe in this form of philosophical presupposi- tionalism, although he frequently used the term “presuppositional” to describe his own apologetic approach. He sought first to establish an independent and prior concept of truth — neutral common ground — which can serve as a point of contact between the saved and the lost. Schaeffer adopted the analogy of a man who lives under a roof. The roof is his system of anti-biblical presuppositions. It shields him from the real world, the world God has made. Thus, Schaeffer con- cluded, when we deal with this man, we must let in certain truths from outside the roof. We must remove the shelter a piece at a time. What is our first step, logically speaking? To avoid an initial appeal to the Bible. “The truth that we let in)rst is not a dogmatic statement of the truth of the Scriptures, but the truth of the external world and the truth of what man himself is. This is what shows him his need. The Scriptures then show him the real nature of his Iostness and the answer to it. This, 1 am convinced, is the true order for our apologetics in the second half of the t wen - 24. This is admitted by Forrest Baird’s survey article on the background of Schaeffer’s thought: “Schaeffer by and large accepted this presuppositionalism of Van Til. But as Kenneth Harper has pointed out, Schaeffer was not a thorough- going presuppositionalist. . . .“ Baird, “Schaeffer’s Intellectual Roots,” in Ronald W.

Clearly not. Man already knows ‘the external world’ and its ‘mannish- ness .’ God doesn’t have to tell him and we don’t have to tell him what God has, from the beginning, told him. God needs only to ‘refer’ to what he already knows; surely this is also all we as believers in God need to do, as we seek to win men to an acceptance of Christianity.”zT What Van Til was concerned about was not that Schaeffer had borrowed Van Til’s terminology of presuppositionalism without credit; rather, he was concerned that Schaeffer had not fully understood or fully accepted the explicit biblical foundation of presuppositionalism: th denial of neutral common-ground natural logic. Van Til’s rigorous critique exposed Schaeffer’s apologetics as only halfway presuppositional. To put this in the terminology of covenant theology, Schaeffer was not sufficiently precise on the doctrine of God’s transcendence, meaning His absolute sovereignty. He was therefore not solid on the doctrine of hierarchy: man’s ability to think God’s thoughts after him on~ as a totally dependent, non-autonomous creature. Schaeffer waffled: 1) on affirming the absolute sovereignty of God; and 2) on denying every degree of autonomy in man. On the final three points – law, sanctions, and continuity – he was no worse than Van Til in theory, but he was far more vocal, making him a much greater liabil- ity. In summary, Schaeffer affirmed publicly none of the five points of biblical covenantalism, although officially he did so when he affirmed the Westminster Confession of Faith and its catechisms. In this, he was like the last three centuries of Presbyterians, who have affirmed these confessional standards while ignoring their Puritan theocratic roots. W’hy the Silence? Rev. Schaeffer never replied publicly to Van Til, but these criti- cisms rankled him. 2s As his disciple-biographer remarks: ‘Later one 26. The God Who Is There, in The Complete Wmkx of Francis A.

Rev. Schaeffer responded privately to some within L’Abri: ‘I would hate to think that I might spend my retirement doing something like that!’ “ 29 Clearly, Schaeffer took these criticisms personally, never under- standing that Van Til wrote strictly from a professional and intellec- tual basis. He treated everyone else the same way! Van Til under- stood what every Christian apologist must do: defend the faith, espe- cially from those who have made crucial errors that will inevitably lead to disastrous intellectual (i.e., moral) compromise later on. This is exactly what has been the fate of the Schaeffer movement in less than half a decade since his death: disastrous compromises with secular humanism, and all in the name of Christian pluralism. This same commitment to the neutrality doctrine was subse- quently reflected in Schaeffer’s social theory in A Christian Man$esto (1981). What I argue in this chapter is that his commitment to the neutrality doctrine in philosophy destroyed what littlb remained of the Schaeffer movement after his death in 1984. When the Schaeffer- ites at long last realized that they could not maintain a commitment to biblical Christianity and ethical and epistemologica.1 neutralit y in their so-called “secular” callings, they abandoned their formerly out- spoken commitment to Christianity in their respective professional callings. This has been most visible in Dr. C. Everett Koop’s “con- dom wars” and in Franky Schaeffer’s ill-fated 1987 R-rated movie, Wired to Kill. Every Christian social theorist is required by God to make a key intellectual (but ultimately ethical) decision. He must identify one and on~ one of the following as a myth: neutrality or biblical theocracy. Christian social theorists today will do almost anything to avoid making this identification, but sooner or later they have to decide. From the demise of Puritanism after 1660 until the appearance of the Christian Reconstruction movement, Christian social theorists sought to avoid this decision, in order to avoid deciding in favor of theocracy, meaning the world under God’s revealed law.

This was also true of the Schaefferites, but in a different way. Schaeffer and his followers kept saying that secular neutrality is the myth, but when push came to shove in the early 1980s, they finally decided that political pluralism is the lesser of two evils, and that theocracy is the really dangerous myth, so they publicly re-adopted neutrality. This decision had been implicit from the beginning in Francis Schaeffer’s apologetics. It took a decade, 1975-85, for Franky Schaeffer and Dr. Koop to become consistent with that original apologetic method. Francis, Sr. had died with the dilemma still unresolved, but his successors could no longer sustain his system’s inherent intellectual and ethical schizophrenia. Schaeffer’s followers were systematically misled throughout his public, published career regarding what he really believed. I think it is safe to say that it was not an oversight on Schaeffer’s part that he neglected to reprint his 1976 pamphlet defending infant baptism in his misleadingly titled five-volume set, Complete Works (1982). This pamphlet had been published by an obscure local publisher long after he had become the nation’s best-selling evangelical philosopher- critic, a very peculiar publishing arrangement. so As I will show in this chapter, there were other significant elements of self-conscious deception in his later, post-1967 career. His odd combination of theo- logical doctrines inevitably led him into trouble after he began pub- lishing in 1968, trouble that eventually destroyed the institutional remains of his intellectual legacy.

Simple: by failing to mention, let alone affirm, any of Calvinism’s unique doctrines in his popular writings. From the beginning, Francis Schaeffer’s public career– post-1968 – was based heavily on deception. This reliance on deception eventually undermined his theological legacy, as well as his institutional legacy. From an intellectual standpoint, there was a strong element of theological schizophrenia in his later career after he had departed from Rev. Carl McIntire’s brand of Presbyterian fundamentalism. A sim- ilar schizophrenia burdened all of the leaders of the post-1979 New Christian Right, before that short-lived movement disappeared into the swamp of Ronald Reagan’s Presidency. 33 He steadily became trapped by his pessimistic eschatology, by his negative view of biblical law, and by his halfway house apologetic methodology (part neutral- ground rationalism, part Van Tillian presuppositionaliim). He was a transitional figure, but an important one for a decade and a half. Why the Silence? He borrowed from Van Til’s apologetic methodology, under whom he had studied at Westminster Seminary in the mid-1930’s, and also from R. J. Rushdoony’s writings of the 1960’s and early 1970’s, but he never gave either of them credit in his footnotes and bibliographies.

This is referred to by Ronald A. Wells, who says that when he visited L’Abri in the 1960’s, and asked about Rev. Schaeffer’s views on American history, a staff member referred hlm to this taped discussion of This Independent Republic. Wells, “Schaeffer on Amer- i~a,” Rejections on Francis Schaeff~, p. 234. The third discussion took place in 1964, the night Barry Goldwater lost the Presi- dential election. It is most revealing. Rev.

He wrote The Great Evan- gelical Disa$ter (Crossway, 1983), an attack on the social and political apathy of American evangelical churches. This alienated many of his followers. A year later, he died of cancer.3G Neither he nor his son Franky ever resolved the immense contra- diction in their attempt to create an intellectual defense of Christian activism while simultaneously denying biblical law and postmillen- nialism, and also while staying discreetly quiet about the institu- tional Church and the sacraments. The father died in the summer of 1984 without suggesting any resolution to the theological dilemma that his writings had created. Eventually, this contradiction over- whelmed the son. In the fall of 1984, Franky cancelled all his future Christian audience speaking engagements, and he disbanded his own C/zristiarz xlctiui~t tabloid newspaper a few months later. He sold the tabloid’s mailing list and then disappeared from the evangelical scene in order to produce an atrocious R-rated, teenage violence motion picture, Wired to Kill, that was released in 1987 and flopped financially, fortunately, because almost nobody went to see it.

(Crossway, 1985), contains not one essay show- ing the well-known Christian roots of capitalism. Of its seventeen chapters and five appendixes, most are written by self-conscious hu- manists. Part Five of the book does include essays by Christian authors. These essays tell us what does not work — socialism and eco- nomic interventionism by the State — but they do not tell us what economic program is biblically incumbent on Christians to pursue as a systematic replacement for the modern welfare State. The book’s title asks a question which in fact is never dealt with by any of the essays: Is capitalism Christian? This book is an unbaptized defense of anti-socialist secular humanism, which Franky calls democratic capitalism and pluralism. If capitalism is not Christian, why should Christians concern themselves very much about defending it? If it is not worth de- fending in the name of Jesus Christ and the Bible, why should Chris- tians devote very much time, energy, and money in coming to its rescue? If capitalism is nothing more than a system that works well to make more people wealthier, why should Christians regard it as any more crucial to their lives than the next election or some new technological development, i.e., only marginally important in the overall development of God’s kingdom? Capitalism may be only a brief historical force that will be transcended – a traditional criticism made by most socialists. These are a few obvious practical questions. There are also crucial theoretical and historical questions. If cap- italism is not Christian, then why did it arise only in the Christian West? If capitalism “works,” then by what standard should we evalu- ate it? If it works better than all other economic systems, why are all the rest of them equally Christian, meaning equally non-Christian, meaning equally neutral theologically? And how does it happen that Christianity, which is the only true religion, and the only religion 38.

Could it be that there is no fixed relationship between covenantal faithfulness and external blessings? Could it be that there is no covenanta.1 relationship between Christi- anity and economic freedom, which is on$ produced by free market capitalism? Could Christianity be that irrelevant socially? Franky and his authors did not ask any of the questions, because (select one): 1) most of them are not Christians; 2) none of them be- lieves in the biblical covenant sanctions for society (Deut. 28); 3) they have no answers to these questions; 4) they forgot the answers; 5) they are scared to death of appearing to be theonomists; 6) all of the above. Franky Schaeffer came to this embarrassing position because both he and his father systematically refused to defend the idea of an explicitly Christian economics — an economic system that is self- consciously based on Old Testament law. He called for a study of the economic evidence, as if such evidence were neutral, as if religious presuppositions do not control every person’s interpretation of evi- dence, as if he had forgotten the subtitle of his book, A Timefor Anger: The Myth of Neutralip (Crossway, 1982). Once again, he was the intel- lectual heir of his father’s hostility to Van Til’s rigorously presupposi- tional apologetic method.

If he does not affirm the continuing validity of the bibli- cal case laws, his affirmation in favor of Christian civilization is in vain, intellectually speaking. 42 At some point, his denial of the con- tinuing moral and~udicial authority of God’s revealed law will logic- ally force him to affirm some form of natural law theory or common- ground reasoning, i.e., the myth of neutrality. He may prefer for matters of personal taste to deny the myth of neutrality when writing about what goes on inside the abortionist’s office, but if he enters the classroom or the pulpit and publicly affirms democratic pluralism as Christianity’s only temporal goal for society rather than as merely a temporary and transitional historical phenomenon, then he is in principle an ethical and epistemological humanist. He speaks with a forked tongue. If he denies the continuing validity of the revealed law of God, he is implicitly and operational@ a humanist. Democratic pluralism is his true religion, not biblical Christianity. Franky Schaeffer denies the continuing law of God for society. “Christians, of all people, do not want a theocracy. The idea of theocracy denotes the lack of checks and balances.”As This statement, if taken at face value, is a direct attack on God, for it was God who established theocratic civil government in ancient Israel, as well as theocratic fam- ily government and theocratic Church government. Was God’s law for Israel inherently tyrannical because it was inherently “unbalanced”? 44 Yet if Schaeffer’s statement is not taken at face value, it makes no sense at all. Does he think that the concept of institutional checks and bal- ances came from somewhere other than the Old Testament? Does he think that the Greeks or Remans invented the idea of citizenship which is protected by political checks and balances? If so, he ought to read Fustel de Coulanges’ masterpiece, The Ancient City (1864). 41.

In the New Testament, with the church being made up of Jews and Gentiles, and spreading all over the known world from India to Spain in one generation, the church was its own entity. There is no New Testament basis for a link- ing of church and state until Christ, the King returns. The whole “Constan- tine mentality” from the fourth century up to our day was a mistake. Con- stantine, as the Roman Emperor, in 313 ended the persecution of Chris- tians. Unfortunately, the support he gave to the church led by 381 to the en- forcing of Christianity, by Theodosius I, as the official state religion. Mak- ing Christianity the official state religion opened the way for confusion up till our own day. There have been times of very good government when this interrelationship of church and state has been present. But through the cen- turies it has caused great confusion between loyalty to the state and loyalty to Christ, between patriotism and being a Christian. We must not confuse the Kingdom of God with our country. To say it another way: ‘We should not wrap Christianity in our national flag.”46 What he really means, of course, is that we should not wrap our na- tion in Christianip%$ag. But every nation must be wrapped in some religious flag. There is no religious or ethical neutrality, after all. So, we must ask ourselves, what flag did Francis Schaeffer prefer that we wrap our nation in? He never said, but since there is no neutrality, there will always be a flag (i.e., a public symbol of political sover- eignty). It flies high today in the name of neutrality, flapping over the public school system. It flies high every time a nation defaults from an explicit religion. That flag is the flag of secular humanism. Francis Schaeffer vs. the National Covenant There are four major problems in the passage cited above. First, notice the confusing use of the word “church” in his argument. He rejected any link (undefined) between Church (undefined) and State: “There is no New Testament basis for a linking of church and state until Christ, the King returns.” What does he mean by the word “church”? Did he mean the Church as the historic institution 45. For evidence, see Gary North and David Chilton, “Apologetics and Strategy,” Chtistiani~ and Civilization, 3 (1983), pp. 116-31. 46.

If so, there is never a time when Church and State are supposed to be fused (if this is what he means by “linked”) in God’s kingdom (civilization), not even in the coming premillennial kingdom that Schaeffer believed in. Church and State are separate covenantal institutions. The State is supposed to enforce the specified negative sanctions of biblical civil law by means of the sword; the Church offers the positive sanctions of the sacraments and enforces its discipline in terms of the negative sanc- tion of withholding the sacraments. Schaeffer never got this clear in his own mind. If he had, he would have had to affirm the New Cove- nant legitimacy of a theocratic republic. On the other hand, if he meant Church as ekklesia – “called-out” Christians – then his argument officially turns the civil government over to Satan. If Christians as citizens are not required by God to bring their Bible-based views to bear on politics, and to pass legisla- tion that conforms to God’s revealed case laws, then anti-Christians inherit all civil governments by default. Sometimes Schaeffer re- jected such an idea, and he called for Christian political participa- tion, but he always rejected the idea that biblical law is to be the model for Christian legislation. At other times (such as in this pas- sage), he affirmed the separation of Christianit y and State by rejec- ting the idea of a national covenant, for such a covenant clearly necessitates public obedience to biblical law. Second, what did he mean by the word “linked” when he wrote: “There is no New Testament basis for a linking of church and state until Christ, the King returns”? He never said what he meant. Did he mean a legal tie, with the institutional Church giving orders to civil magistrates? Did he mean that church membership is required for voting, meaning that only Christians are allowed to give orders to civil magistrates? He simply did not tell us what he meant. This necessarily confuses the reader. Loyal@ to Jesus Christ Third, he correctly observed that the fusion of Christianity (not the institutional Church) and State “has caused great confusion be- tween Ioyalt y to the state and loyalty to Christ, between patriotism and being a Christian.” So what? So has the fusion of family and Christianity, as Jesus predicted, quoting Micah 7:6. Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"182 POLITICAL POLYTHEISM father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. And a man’s foes shall be they of his own house- hold (Matt. 10:34-36). To paraphrase Schaeffer, “through the centuries it has caused great confusion between loyalty to the family and loyalty to Christ, between being a good family man and being a Christian.” The point is, deciding these inescapable conzicts of loyalty in favor of Jesus Christ is the essence of loyal~ to Jesus. There is no more neutrality in the relation be- tween Christianity and civil government than between Christianity and family government or Christianity and Church government. Evtvy human institution and human relationship is to be brought under the visi- ble, covenantal lordship of Jesus Christ. There are no exceptions. If this leads to ‘confusion,” then the proper solution to such confusion is to think about these problems from the point of view of the entire Bible, Old and New Testaments, rather than to abandon biblical law in favor of an implicit acceptance of some version of Greek natural law theory. W%ose Flag? Fourth, he said, We must not confuse the Kingdom of God with our country. To say it another way: We should not wrap Christianity in our national flag.’” He was correct, but he deliberately failed to discuss what the Bible teaches that we should do: wrap our national~ag in Christianity. We must not confuse the kingdom of God with our country, for the kingdom of God is international and above all na- tions, 47 but each Christian should work all his life to do what he can to lead his business, his children’s school, his family, his church, his local community, and his country into the international kingdom of God in history. This is what it means to deny the myth of neutrality; it means affirming the legitimacy of positive kingdom activities in history and then working to achieve some of them locally.48 This is also what it means to pray in faith and confidence, “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven” (Matt. 6:10). If Jesus did not expect this prayer to be answered in history, He would not have told us: “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you” (Matt. 7:7). 47.

Christians believe that in the marketplace of ideas they can demon- strate the superiority of Christian ideas; therefore, Christians are not afraid to discuss their beliefs with others and promote freedom of speech. Christianity teaches that God has given us moral boundaries for the public good or for the good of society, as well as for the good of each individual. Christians stand up for biblical absolutes in the essential areas of public morality, because we know that in doing so we are preserving good government, our society, and our culture.”49 Hear, hear! This is the correct biblical view, as stated. The judicial and political problem comes when we get down to that crucial clause, “within the moral boundaries set by God in the Bible.” What moral boundaries? How do we gain public agreement about them? Do we appeal to natural law? To existentialism? To the will of the peo- ple? What standards? The whole Bible, Old and New Testaments? Or man’s autonomous mind? Which absolutes? (There are lots of abso- lutes in the Bible.) Then come additional questions. Which areas of public morality are essential? How are the appropriate biblical stan- dards to be enforced? This was the problem of political sovereignty that Schaeffer avoided dealing with in detail throughout his entire career, for he could see where the answer to such questioning must eventually lead: to theocracy, or to natural law philosophy, or to raw totalitarian power. Illogically, he denied all three, and his movement disintegrated within four years of his death. The Unresolved Tmsion There was an unresolved tension in his later writings regarding political questions, just as there had been an unresolved tension in his earlier philosophical writings: the presupposition of the Bible as the starting point of all knowledge (revelational apologetics) vs. the acceptance of the autonomous human mind as the judge of all knowledge (neutral common-ground apologetics). Schaeffer used a halfivay house apologetic method, neither fully presuppositional nor fully evidential. Baird’s assessment needs correction: “. . . Schaeffer accepted Van Til’s presuppositionalism, though he placed more em- 49. Parkhurst, Francis Scha#er, pp. 131-32."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"184 POLITICAL POLYTHEISM phasis on the common ground the believer has with the nonbeliever.”so What Van Til taught was that there is no common philosophical ground between covenant-breakers and covenant-keepers; there is only the common ground of the image of God in man. The covenant- breaker sees, but represses, the truth of God’s special and natural rev- elation to him (Rem. 1:18-22). Thus, it is not surprising that SchaeffePs halfway covenant apologetics led to confusion. Nor is it surprising that, as Baird remarks, that Schaeffer “always seemed uncomforta- ble when cornered on the question of his apologetic approach.”51 It is interesting that Schaeffer’s escape hatch with respect to his vague apologetic methodology was the same as Van Til’s escape hatch regarding eschatology and biblical law: “It’s not my field!” Baird reports: “Asked at a large meeting whether he was a presuppo- sitionalist or an evidentialist, Schaeffer replied, ‘I’m neither. I’m not an evidentialist or a presuppositionalist. You’re trying to press me into the category of a theological apologist, which I’m really not. I’m not an academic, scholastic apologist. My interest is evangelism.’ “5 2 Schaeffer’s answer was deceptive, perhaps even self-deceptive, just as Van Til’s was. It was no more possible for Schaeffer to sepa- rate his religious-philosophical critique of twentieth-century human- ism from the question of apologetic methodology than it was for Van Til to separate his apologetics from the questions of biblical law and eschatology. Hollinger is correct: “Francis Schaeffer was first and fore- most an apologist, a defender of the Christian faith to the twentieth- century mind.”53 His interest was evangelism, but his chosen mis- sion field was the world of academic scholarship, art, and literature. He did not get invited to speak at Oxford University because he was a country boy preacher. Country boy preachers have to content themselves with satellite ministries, Lear jets, and colleges named after them. Schaeffer’s few remaining institutional heirs have no self-conscious apologetic approach, and they have willing] y adopted the philosophy of permanent political pluralism, the philosophical basis of which is 50.

They have adopted political pluralism because th~ do not believe that Christians can ever win in history. They are trying to buy time by leasing out the crown rights of King Jesus to the highest bidder. They are willing to rely on judicial decisions made by the second-rate humanists of the democratic West in preference to proclaiming the legitimacy of bibli- cal theocracy, yet these Western humanists are busy selling out the West to the first-rate humanists behind the Iron Curtain. 54 The Myth of Neutrality By denying the biblical legitimacy of the idea of the national cov- enant, Schaeffer was necessarily proclaiming the myth of neutrality, the myth of natural law, and the myth of permanent political pluralism. Ultimately, this is a single myth: the myth of equal time for Satan. There is no logical escape from this conclusion. If neutrality is a myth, then there is a full-scale war going on between Jesus Christ and Satan, between Jesus’ kingdom and Satan’s empire, between Jesus’ law and Satan’s counterfeit laws. This is why Schaeffer, despite occasional language to the contrary, never broke with Greek natural law theory. This is why his published followers still publicly proclaim the ideal of political pluralism through natural law, although they refuse to use the phrase “natural law.” The deception continues. The Cancer of Relativism Francis Schaeffer hated the inevitable result of political plural- ism: relativism. What he refused to admit anywhere in his writings was that this relativism has been implicit in pluralism from the be- ginning. The following extract from A Christian Manfesto reveals his problem. The transition from what is described in the first paragraph to what is described in the second was not the result of a discontinu- ous historical break; it was the result of a continuous philosophical development: 54.

POLITICAL POLYTHEISM Along with the decline of the Judeo-Christian consensus we have come to a new definition and connotation of “pluralism.” Until recently it meant that the Christianity flowing from the Reformation is not now as dominant in the country and in society as it was in the early days of the nation. After about 1848 the great influx of immigrants to the United States meant a sharp increase in viewpoints not shaped by Reformation Christianity. This, of course, is the situation which exists today. Thus as we stand for religious free- dom today, we need to realize that this must include a general religious free- dom from the control of the state for all religion. It will not mean just freedom for those who are Christians. It is then up to Christians to show that Chris- tianity is the Truth of total reality in the open marketplace of freedom. This greater mixture in the United States, however, is now used as an excuse for the new meaning and connotation of pluralism. It now is used to mean that all types of situations are spread out before us, and that it really is up to each individual to grab one or the other on the way past, according to the whim of personal preference. What you take is only a matter of per- sonal choice, with one choice as valid as another. Pluralism has come to mean that everything is acceptable. This new concept of pluralism suddenly is everywhere. There is no right or wrong; it is just a matter of your per- sonal preference. . . . This new definition and connotation of pluralism is presented in many forms, not only in personal ethics, but in society’s ethics and in choices concerning law. 55 To which I reply: “What else did you expect? That the philoso- phy of political pluralism could protect a society against a wave of immigrants if civil law grants them all the right to vote? Would you expect to be able to protect the covenantal integrity of a church if anyone could walk in, join the church, and vote, no matter what he believed theologically? Did you think it is possible to restrict relativ- ism in personal ethics to the heart of man, and not have it become relativism in social ethics?” Schaeffer was trapped by the terms of his own philosophy. He, as is true of all Christian social antinomians, really did believe that the personal ethics of Christianity need not, and should not, become the exclusive judicial foundation for society in general and civil govern- ment in particular. Thus, he had to believe that the inherent relativ- ism of humanism’s per$onal ethics would not inevitably invade and capture any civil government judicially founded on the principle of political pluralism, which is itself nothing more than the political philosophy of relativism writ large. He really did believe that it is 55. Schaeffer, Christian Man festo, pp. 45-47; Complete Works, V, p. 440."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Ha~way Covenant Social Criticism 187 possible, philosophically and perhaps even historically, to affirm the independence of the State from the requirements of biblical law in the name of an inherently undefinable moral law, yet simultaneously preserve the integrity of the Church from the same principle of pluralism (antinomianism) that one has already affirmed as judi- cially binding on the State. What Schaeffer refused to face was that this “new” pluralism is in fact the old pluralism become consistent. When the common grace of God was removed from natural law theory, as Darwinism made its rapid worldwide conquest, the underlying relativism of natural man’s philosophy became visible. It had always been relativistic, but it has become visibly so in the twentieth century. Schaeffer fought this humanistic development of relativism in the fields of personal ethics, art, literature, philosophy, and popular culture. He did not fight it – could not fight it – in the field of political action, given his view of the religiously neutral State. And when it was all over, his son made a ghastly R-rated, violence-filled movie that contained no explicitly Christian message of redemption. This was the fate of his halfway covenant social criticism: relativism invaded his own house- hold by means of the epistemological and ethical drawbridge that he left down in the field of political theory. The principle of the leaven means that the conflict is total. There is no neutrality. The Professors’ Knee-Jerk Political Pluralism Schaeffer has been criticized in recent years by neo-evangelical scholars who think that he did not go far enough in proclaiming the wonders of pluralism. They see him as a kind of closet theocrat, whereas we theocrats see him as the Pied Piper of Pluralism. The man in the collapsing middle is like a fish caught between two cats. 56 Wells It is interesting to note that even Schaeffer’s mild observation concerning the effects of late nineteenth-century immigration out- rages Calvin College historian Ronald A. Wells. “While he does not name the Irish specifically, Schaeffer suggests that 1848 is a turning year, a year in which the mass migration from famine-ridden Ireland began.

The great migration to the United States did indeed begin in 1848, and it accelerated with the development of the steam- ship in the 1870’s. It was not just the Irish famine that swelled the seaboard cities of the East. What does not seem to have occurred to Professor Wells is that 1848 was also the year of the socialist revolu- tions of Continental Europe, the year of Marx’s Communist Mant$esto. Marx and Engels celebrated these revolutions, and were saddened that they did not triumph and did not go far enough in their radical- ism. 58 In the wake of the defeat of those revolutions by conservative forces, several thousand humanist, socialist, and anti-Christian political refugees streamed into the United States, accompanied by three quarters of a million peasants, not all Irish, who had also de- cided that it was time for a change. 59 Few of the immigrants were revolutionaries; most were Northern Europeans. But 1848 is the obvious year to date the beginning of the change in the religious make-up of the American voter. ‘o The year 1854 was the peak year for immigration until 1873, with over 400,000 immigrants entering the U.

Wells and his politically liberal campus colleagues ignore many things besides the historical facts. They ignore the enormous prob- lem of evangelism that nineteenth-century American Christians faced, a battle for the heart of the United States and thereby for Western civilization. Secular historians are sometimes far more sen- sitive to this problem. Historian Paul Kleppner calls attention to a Methodist conference statement in 1891 which described the problem well: “Unsaved millions of foreigners are coming to our shores, forc- ing upon us one of the greatest missionary questions of modern evangelism, viz.: — shall America be unamericanized, or shall mil- lions of North American citizens be brought into sympathy with our Christian institutions through the church of Jesus Christ?”G4 It also should be noted that during the era in which Christianity was dominant politically in the United States, there was wide-open immigration. It was only after modern democratic humanism gained total power at the natioiial level — after World War I — that the immi- gration law of 1924 closed the door of sanctuary to most foreigners. So, the problem of political pluralism is in fact international in both scope and theory, an inescapable fact that all the defenders of democratic political pluralism refuse even to mention, let alone deal with. Today’s democratic pluralists in every nation use coercive immigration bar- riers to keep out the “great foreign unwashed” who might not fit into national humanist plans. Today, the humanists screen primarily by means of race, although this is hidden because of the language of an- nual national immigration quotas. This racial screening was quite openly admitted in the 1920’s, when racial Darwinism and especially eugenics (genetic racial selection) were dominant ideas. Immigrat- ion barriers, sterilization of retarded people and sometimes even the poor, and national intelligence tests all appeared at once in the United States, and all were promoted in the name of scientific racism — humanist planned, financed, and delivered. 65 Eugenics 64.

Since this conversion process hap- pens progressively in history, Christians will unquestionably “change law and practices through the law courts and by political means.” It is the self-imposed intellectual curse of amillennialism and premil- lennialism that its defenders do not understand that biblical theocracy in evey area of l$e can and should come through majority vote or acceptance. And when Christians have the votes, they will then be faced with the moral and political question that today’s Chris- tian antinomians dread and deeply resent: By what standard? I find it a bit amusing that Wells says of Schaeffer that ‘What Schaeffer really cannot handle is pluralism, although he says he de- fends it.”71 Just because Schaeffer was morally appalled by the obvi- ous relativism of plur~ism — a relativism which Wells does not even try to deny — Wells dismisses him as an enemy of pluralism. Ques- tion any aspect of political pluralism in terms of biblical morality, and you thereby question humanist democracy; question humanist de- mocracy, and you invoke the wrath of the social studies and humanities professors of every Christian liberal arts college in the land.

Schaeffer deserved Professor Wells. Wells proves that it does no good to soft-pedal biblical social ethics. No matter how softly you pedal, someone at Calvin College will be outraged. 68.

Listen to his assessment of the supposed irrelevance, impotence, and downright malevolence of the idea of a Christian society: “Only a solid biblical doctrine of the church enables us to assert that the kingdom of God is qualitatively different from the powers of this world, and that the latter cannot live by spe- cific Christian principles, since they do indeed have a different view of reality. To impose Christianity on society, or seek to make it the legal basis of a social order, tends to generate undue hostility in a pluralistic context. More importantly, it undermines the uniqueness of the church. The theocratic ideal, which Schaeffer seems implicitly to support, fails to recall that it is the church, not America, that is ‘a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.’ “ 72 And what is he professor of? You may not believe this: Church and Society. What he seems to be saying is that if Christian standards are used to govern society in general, this “undermines the uniqueness of the church.” Does this also include standards for the family? If so, then on what basis shall God-fearing people promote civil laws against incest? Or bestiality? This raises another important question: Will the pluralist princi- ple of “equal time for Satan” exist in eternity? If not, will this absence of rival theological views in eternity undermine the unique- ness of the Church? Schaeffer actually said pretty much what Hollinger says about the necessity of distinguishing America from the Church, as well as the necessity of political pluralism, but Hollinger is so outraged – I see no other obvious motivation — by the mildly worded moral warn- ing that Schaeffer raises regarding pluralism’s moral relativism (i. e., immorality) that he literally cannot understand what Schaeffer has clearly written. This seldom stops a liberal from going into print. Judicial Blindness I am preparing you for evidence in Chapter 5 that Christian aca- demic pluralists are so utterly enraged by the very idea of biblical theocracy – the visible manifestation of God% kingdom (civilization) 72.

They have become judicially blinded. They hate God’s law with all their hearts. They want humanist theocracy — “ VOX populi, vox dei” — in preference to biblical theocracy. They prefer the social philoso- phy of “equal time for Satan,” even when this always produces “no time for Jesus Christ.”7s (And do they ever screen access to college classroom teaching positions ! Have you ever wondered why political liberals always seem to control the colleges, even so-called Christian colleges? Because when it comes to their monopolistic turf, political pluralism is anathema. Rival views are screened out with a ven- geance. It is a classic example of “Do as I say, and not as I do.”) Schaeffer had his faults. He suffered from a major liability: he chose to enter the academic battlefield without advanced formal training in any academic discipline. He had been isolated in Swit- zerland for two decades, teaching himself about the humanist West. He was not the recipient of high wages and tenure at some college. He did not have access to a scholar’s library. He tended to borrow selectively from other scholars, not always granting credit through footnoting. But his parent-subsidized neo-evangelical opponents have played fast and loose with the facts. They have had more than adequate time and financial support to enable them to begin to deal honestly with their intellectual opponents, but they much prefer to beat up the less prepared opponents, preferably posthumously. They’ select targets who cannot easily fight back. The tenured professors in neo-evangelical colleges are willing to attack Schaeffer, but they are strangely silent about the writings of Bahnsen, Rushdoony, and North. There are reasons for this. 74 The Case of the Missing Footnotes The following remarks need this preface: I do not think Francis Schaeffer actually researched or wro~e A Christian Man$esto. At the 73. The Scopes “monkey trial” of 1925 was fought over the legal right of a public school biology teacher to teach Darwinism alongside creationism. Today, it is illegal for public school teachers to mention creationism in a science classroom. But our Christian pluralists say not a word in protest. George Marsden even went so far – ideologically and geographically — to testify in favor of the AC LUS position during the Arkansas creation trial, McLean v. Arkansas, in 1981. 74.

Like his popular early books, which were edited by James Sire from tapes of SchaeffeFs lectures,’s A Ch.ri~tian Man.~edo may have been merely edited in its final stages by Schaeffer. If he did research it, then he was even more dishonest in hiding footnotes than I have previously indicated. Chilton’s DiscoueV In 1981, David Chilton spotted a phrase on page 97 of A Christian Manfesto which had been lifted virtually word for word from page 200 of Chilton’s essay on John Knox, published in early 1979. Here is what he found: Chilton: Within a few years, tens of thousands of Huguenots were offering armed resistance to the French government; and the year Knox died saw the beginning of the successful Calvinist revolt and takeover of Holland and Zeeland. Knox had shocked the world with his Adm.orz.itz’on to England, but he had also convinced it. As Ridley states it, “The theory of the justification of revolution is Knox’s speckd contribution to theological and politicaJ thought.”76 Schaeffer: Within a few years, tens of thousands of Huguenots were offering armed resistance to the French government; and the year Knox died saw the beginning of the successful revolt and saving of Holland. Knox had shocked the world with his Admonition to England, but he had also been convincing. Jasper Ridley in John Knox writes, “The theory of the justifica- tion of revolution is Knox’s special contribution to theological and political thought.”77 Then Chilton spotted another direct lifting, in this case from Richard Flinn’s essay on Samuel Rutherford, which appeared in the 75. Philip Yancey, “Francis Schaeffer: A Prophet for Our Time?” C/wi~tiani~ Today (March 23, 1979), p. 16. Yancey says that only What Ever Happened to the Human Race (1979) and How Should We Then Live (1976) were books actually written by Schaeffer, as distinguished from edited tapes (p. 17). Tremendous pressure was brought against the editor of IVP, through Franky Schaeffer’s mobilizing of public protests to the IVP Board of Trustees when IVP’S published the pro-abortion book, Braoe New People (1984) by D. Gareth Jones. As Franky said in an interview on Pat Robertson’s “700 Club,” IVP made its money with his father’s books and then wound up publishing a pro-abortion book. IVP soon dropped the book, Eerdmans then picked it up. 76.

Flinn: Rutherford suggests that there are levels of resistance in which a private person may engage. Firstly, he must defend himself by supplications and apologies; secondly, he must seek to flee if at all possible; and, thirdly, he may use violence to defend himself. One should not employ violence if he may save himself by flight; so one should not employ flight if he can save and defend himself by supplications and the employment of constitutional means of redress. Rutherford illustrates this pattern of resistance from the life of David. 7s On the other hand, when the offense is against a corporate group such as a duly constituted state or town or local body, or such as a church, then flight is often an impractical and unrealistic means of resistance. 79 Schaeffer: In such an instance, for the private person, the individual, Rutherford suggested that there are three appropriate levels of resistance: First, he must defend himself by protest (in contemporary society this would most often be by legal action); second, he must flee if at all possible; and, third, he may use force, if necessary, to defend himself. One should not em- ploy force if he may save himself by flight; nor should one employ flight if he can save himself and defend himself by protest and the employment of constitutional means of redress. Rutherford illustrated this pattern of resis- tance from the life of David as it is recorded in the Old Testament. 80 On the other hand, when the state commits illegitimate acts against a corporate body — such as a duly constituted state or local body, or even a church — then flight is often an impractical and unrealistic means of resistance. 81 Even some of the italics are the same! Chilton complained about these clear-cut cases of plagiarism in a letter to Schaeffer, and he re- ceived a reply from a subordinate pleading that Schaeffer had been given the material from a researcher without any source notes at- tached, and that the lack of acknowledgment was not really Schaeffer’s fault. If this was the case, it is pathetic. If this was not the case, then it is also pathetic.

What is missing points clearly to the theological schizophrenia of Francis Schaeffer’s social criticism: an attempted rejection of humanism, yet also a re- jection of biblical law. Here is what Flinn concluded regarding Rutherford’s teachings on the case laws. First, Rutherford used the Old Testament magis- trate as the model for today’s civil magistrate. Second, he insisted that God’s law alone properly defines crime. Flinn observes: “We have seen that the magistrate cannot arbitrarily suspend punishment from or pardon those crimes which God’s law stipulates as capital crimes, and requiring the death penalty. To do so is to deify the state .“8 3 Rutherford’s third principle regarding the civil magistrate and the case law is that the magistrate has a duty to enforce all ten commandments, not just the second five. s4 Finally, wrote Flinn, “The most conclusive evidence for Ruther- ford’s position on the case law being one of continuing validity for 82.

A cursory reading of ~ex, Rex, for example, will demonstrate that Rutherford’s whole case is predicated upon Deuteronomy 17. This part of the case law is what he uses to provide the foundation for his doctrine of the civil magis- trate and civil government. What is of particular interest in the use of this case law is that it spec~cal~ calls for the application of that same case law to civil government, crime, lawmaking, and punishment. . . . But, what is of further interest in this regard, is that whereas Deuteron- omy 17 is the most frequently quoted passage of Scripture in Lex, Rex, it is followed in only slightly less frequency by references to Remans 13:1-6. This is highly significant, for it proves beyond doubt that Rutherford belieued that there is continui~ throughout history of the divine prescriptions for civil government and the civil magistrate. The doctrine of Remans 13 does not abrogate the Old Testament stipulations for government, but ratifies them and builds upon them.”as Francis Schaeffer returned to the life and supposed legacy of Samuel Rutherford again and again in A Christian Man festo. His close associate, lawyer John Whitehead, named his Christian legal defense organization The Rutherford Institute. Yet it is clear that Schaeffer’s reliance on Rutherford’s example was half-hearted, just as his reliance on Van Til and Rushdoony was half-hearted. He appealed to a narrowly and even ultimately misleading selective segment of Rutherford’s witness. He refused to admit to his readers where Rutherford’s position clearly led: to the Old Testament5 case laws. Why? Rutherford died just as the civil authorities were coming to try him in court and then execute him. No one was coming to arrest Francis Schaeffer for any similar breach of evangelical etiquette when he passed from the scene. What was his problem? It was this: Francis Schaefer was nervous about his own Calvinist theological heritage– nervous in principle, but also nervous strategically. If he was too embarrassed to admit to his evangelical followers that he had once written a pamphlet in favor of infant baptism, then he was hardly going to tell them the full story regarding his proposed model theologian, Samuel Rutherford, who accepted the continuing validity of civil laws against homosexuals, witches, and adulterers. ‘G 85, Ibid., pp. 72-73. 86.

He was much more interested in the arts. His writings are theologically self-contradictory at their very core (e. g., myth of neutrality vs. fear of theocracy). His hostility to theocracy led him to reject the continuing validity of the case laws of the Old Testament. This rg”ection of biblical law forced him into a disastrous compromise with nat- ural law theory. His closely related unwillingness to go the whole dis- tance with Van Til’s presuppositional defense of Christianity led to his unwillingness to break completely with humanism’s faith in the autonomy of man’s mind. His premillennial eschatology left him devoid of hope that Christians could do anything to reverse the drift into humanistic disaster. Thus, the great evangelical disaster was also his disaster. The sad fate of ‘his spiritual and intellectual heirs testifies to this continuing legacy of disaster. Franky Schaeffer is like his father in a crucial respect: as a pre- millennialist, he does not believe that Christians can ever be success- ful in replacing the corrupt humanist institutions of this world. He thinks that the world could be converted,s7 but that it will not be converted. Also like his father, he has spent his career publicly ignor- ing the writings of the Christian Reconstructionists. But the old political slogan is correct: “You can’t beat something with nothing.” He demonstrated the reality of this principle when he departed from the evangelical scene in 1985. The Co-Opting of Dr. Koop Franky’s relatively quiet drift out of Christian activism was par- alleled by the noisy public defection by Schaeffer’s former anti- abortion associate, Dr. C. Everett Koop, the Surgeon General of the United States, 1981-89.’s That he was known by his associates throughout his stay in Washington as “Chick Koop,” short for Chicken, is one of the great ironies of recent American politics, for in terms of his self-conscious public abandoning of everything he had proclaimed prior to 1980, he was indeed chicken.

The media had not changed; Koop had – which, of course, he denied to the very end. go When he came on the scene as the only visibly Christian appoin- tee by the Reagan Administration, he was vocally opposed by the liberal media. The office of Surgeon General carries with it very little legal authority, and prior to Dr. Koop, the office had never been a publicly visible office, yet the liberals nevertheless strongly resisted his appointment. Even his presence was resisted. He had been too vocal an opponent of abortion. Writes Marie Winn of the New York Times: “The nomination was held up for more than eight months. Only after Dr. Koop promised to abandon the antiabortion circuit and to refrain from using the surgeon general’s office as a pulpit for his right-to-life beliefs did the Senate finally vote its approval. Not only did he keep his promise, but his policies as Surgeon General proved so different from what his fearful opponents expected that in time, almost without exception, the y publicly disavowed their for- mer words about C. Everett Koop.”gl That Koop agreed to stop talk- ing about abortion in order to secure his approval was also reported by the Rutherford Institute, the Schaeffer-founded activist public law organization. 92 For the next two years, he slipped into obscurity. Meanwhile, in 1982, a newborn handicapped infant was allowed to die of starvation and dehydration by a hospital and local judge in Indiana. The fed- eral government in response drew up anti-infanticide regulations. No hospital that discriminated against the life of a handicapped in- fant could receive federal funds. The U.S. Supreme Court declared these regulations unconstitutional; it is the parents’ right to decide, the court said. Koop had been on the side of the government in this battle. But he had caved in to the medical establishment by agreeing to a rewritten version that allowed the hospitals’ medical ethics com- mittees to make the ‘final decision regarding the infants’ life or death. 93 90.

Then came the 1986 Surgeon General’s report on AIDS. Koop in 1986 and 1987 officially called for sex education on AIDS in the public schools as early as kindergarten94 and for public school instruction on how to use condoms. 95 We see here the classical Greek heresy: salvation through knowledge. “If men know what is right, they will do it.” This is utter nonsense. It reverses the epistemolog- ical truth regarding fallen man, as Schaeffer fully understood. Safer Sodomy Under questioning, Dr. Koop admitted that as Surgeon General, he would have to recommend abortion as one way of dealing with the unborn children of mothers with AIDS. ‘G “Better that than to resign publicly,” he seemed to be saying. He loved to wear his Ad- miral’s uniform, which the Surgeon General’s position entitles him to wear.

Then, without media attention, he quietly reversed himself in the fall of 1987, admitting that condoms really are not much protection for homosexual con- tacts. 98 I like to think of this admission as Koop’s self-condemnation. This devastating admission received very little publicity. Pro-life ac- tivist Jo Ann Gasper, a high-level civil servant who has served in both the Department of Health and Human Services and the De- partment of Education, has put it very well: “When Dr. Koop came out for safe sex, he was like a man standing on top of a church who slashes open a feather pillow and shakes it.

It invariably results in the abandonment of God’s law and the triumph of God’s enemies. In this crisis, when God raised him up so that he could make visi- ble the nation’s highest official medical office, in the very year that AIDS was identified, 1981, Dr. Koop returned to the common- ground philosophy of natural law and neutral science. In 1987, he announced: “I am not afforded the luxury of bringing ideology or morals into my job, especially with the sort of threat we have with AIDS.

The rise of promiscuity among teenagers always accompanies the rise of sex education in the public schools. Prof. Jacquelin R. Kasun 104 of California’s Humboldt State University summarizes the findings of two social scientists who discovered that teenagers who have had classroom sex education courses are more likely to engage in premarital sex at an early age – 15 and 16 – than those who have had no formal classroom instruction. The study, by William Mar- siglio and Frank L. Mott, was actually published by the Guttmacher Institute’s journal, Fami@ Planning Per.@ectiues (July/Aug. 1986). The Guttmacher Institute at one time was the research affiliate of the pro-abortion Planned Parenthood organization. A second study by Deborah Anne Dawson, published in the same issue of the Institute’s journal, argues that there is no consistent statistical effect, but does report that one of her statistical models shows that “prior contracep- tive education increases the odds of becoming sexually active at age 14 by a factor of 1.5 ,“ meaning by 50 percent. Then what does work to increase chastity? Church. Dr. Kasun reports that the effects of regular church attendance on premarital sexual behavior by girls over 17 are stronger than any other observed effect. She concludes: “The policy implications of these findings are obvious. If the intent is to reduce premarital sexual activity and pregnancy among teenagers, there is-no evidence that sex education will help. Church will. And so will a stable home environment.” As a good economist, Dr. Kasun chides the sociologists who wrote these studies for their inattention to the economist’s prime fac- tor: Price. “A youngster who is given free contraceptives by her school birth-control clinic without her parents’ knowledge and with the promise of a free and confidential abortion in the case of pregnancy, faces a low price for premarital sex activity. She can be expected to consume more of it than a girl with less easy access to contraceptives and abortion.” She then goes on to summarize her own findings, that states that spend most heavily to provide free contraceptives and abortions have the highest rates of premarital teenage pregnancy. The differences are major between states that spend and those that 104.

Teenage fertility was declining before the government birth- control programs were instituted in the late 1960’s, but it has not declined since 1976. “Extra-marital teenage fertility has increased markedly since the programs were begun, and is no lower in states where public expenditures are highest. ” She explains why: “Free birth control encourages sexual risk-taking and therefore a higher level of unintended pregnancy; in this situation many young women find themselves unwilling to undergo abortion. The result, indicated in studies, is a higher level of births that [than] would otherwise oc- cur.’’1°5 The long-run effects of the Presbyterian Church in America’s most famous public official are predictable: more fornication, more abortions, and more disease. A Series of Federal Crusades As he wound down his tenure as Surgeon General, Koop used his office: 1) to send out a pro-condom report to every home in the country (at taxpayers’ expense), 1°G 2) to launch an anti-smoking crusade (at a time when 70 percent of Americans had stopped smok- ing), 3) to publish a 700-page report informing Americans that they eat too much fat; and 4) to call for higher taxes on liquor. 107 He re- fused to call officially for zero sex outside of marriage as the only sure way to halt the spread of AIDS. Condoms, he said, would at least re- duce some of the risk of infection, since people are inevitably going to have sex outside of marriage. The suggestion that AIDS is God’s negative historical sanction against homosexuals and against the so- ciety that tolerates them is unthinkable in Dr. Koop’s view, or at least unprintable. For him, smoking is an addiction; promiscuity is only “behavior.” 108 He has uncompromisingly condemned all cigarettes, even those with filter tips. He recommends only abstinence. For promiscuity, he recommends condoms. As he said: “Total abstinence 105. San Diego Umon (March 5, 1987).

The Plagues During Koopk Watch While Dr. Koop fretted about animal fats in other people’s diets, along with cigarettes and liquor, sexual plagues were taking their toll on Americans. It was not just AIDS that appeared during Koop’s watch; it was an escalating horde of tiny killers. Each year in the U. S., there are ten million new cases of sexually transmitted dis- eases. This breaks down as follows. There are two million new cases annually of gonorrhea that are actual] y reported by women, but as many as 70 percent of those women afflicted with it do not know they have it. Among school-age children, gonorrhea is now the most com- mon disease, surpassing the combined number of cases of chicken pox, mumps, measles, and rubella (German measles). Penicillin is losing its effectiveness against some strains of this disease. There are four to five million new cases of chlamydia. Twenty-five million Americans now suffer from herpes. 111 Out of wedlock births are up by nine to one since 1950; abortion is now the most common surgery procedure in America. 112 Through it all, Dr. Koop remained visible but silent. He wore his uniform proudly and basked in the escalating applause of the hu- manist Left. Those Christians serving in public office who take 109.

The price is too high. But Christians have been enthusiastically paying it in North America for over three hundred years. ~rrell Writes Koo@k Epitaph I cannot resist quoting at length from R. Emmett Tyrrell’s evalu- ation of Koop’s tenure in office. Tyrrell is not a Christian, but he is a conservative. As editor of The American Spectator, he brought the mag- azine (now a tabloid) from utter obscurity ‘in 1967 to perhaps the leading popular organ of conservative opinion in the United States by the early 1980’s. 113 His editorial style is modeled along the lines of H. L. Mencken’s. But allowing for his stylistic exaggeration, Tyrrell’s comments are on target. He wrote the political obituary of C. Everett Koop a few weeks before Koop publicly announced his retirement. It appeared in his regular column, “Public Nuisances .“ As with most evangelical Christians, he was not on the offensive, expanding the power of the church against state; rather he was the embattled believer attempting to preserve traditional morality from the onslaughts of the New Age ideologues directing the police power of the state against the church. But once in office Dr. Koop proved his modern political mettle, which is to say his capacity for publicity, braggadocio, and sniffing out the course of least resistance. Thus as the months slipped by so did Surgeon General Koop, and in June 1987 our own Tom Bethell awarded the Surgeon General his Strange New Respect Award “for putting condoms before continence.” Bethell confers this award upon that conservative who suddenly rises in the esteem of Liberals by seeing the world from their point of view. . . . From opposing abortion and homosexuality he has slipped into a mindless toler- ance, with no explanation offered. His solution to the spread of AIDS is the placebo propounded by all dope-fetchers, to wit: he urges education. Fur- thermore, he is an aficionado of the condom. He beseeches the sexually aroused — whether homosexual or heterosexual — to roll on those condoms, consult a nearby sex manual, and recall all relevant data proffered in Sex Ed. Sex education is the cure for all the perils of Eros, according to Dr. Koop, and the great enlightenment should begin with kindergarten and continue until all kinks have been covered. . . . How sex education might benefit kindergartners who have only recently discovered that their private parts are useful for discharging bodily waste, I cannot imagine. 114 113.

Last summer, when his report on nutrition came out, he again identified the tycoons of the food industry as the greedy malefactor of our cholesterol count. And when it comes to one of his favorite subjects — AIDS — he castigates hospital personnel unwilling to treat AIDS patients .“ But Tyrrell has seen the real heart of Koop’s message: unrelent- ing hypocrisy camouflaged in the rhetoric of public health. “Last summer, during the unveiling of his report on nutrition, Dr. Koop revealed how unserious a man he is. . . . He consumes junk foods happily and two martinis with lunch even more happily. He brags about taking no exercise and being a workaholic. And so when asked at the unveiling of his nutritional report why he ignored his own rec- ommendations in his own life, he replied, ‘For myself I’m counting on my genes. If your cholesterol is OK and you think your genes are good, why should you sit on a hill the rest of your life and eat yogurt?’” T@ell called for Koop’s retirement, which Koop did an- nounce a few days later, though not because of Tyrrell. Tyrrell’s parting shot is worth citing: “If he worries the citizenry any further our next Surgeon General will have to be a clinical psychiatrist .“~ 15 The End of the Road for the Schaeffer Movement Koop’s public defection revealed that there is just about nothing remaining of Francis Schaeffer’s premillennialism-based, anti- theonomic, pro-pluralism, silently Galvinistic, Christian protest movement. (The one major exception is the public law organization, the Rutherford Institute, which was never under Schaeffer’s direct control, and which has always had an independent agenda. It is not Calvinistic.) Jo Ann Gasper, who was fired from her position at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 1987 for having attempted to enforce existing federal laws in the pro-life field, gave this evaluation of Dr. Koop, and it serves as the epitaph for the whole Schaeffer movement: ‘When Schaeffer was alive, he was the one man Dr. Koop respected and listened to. Schaeffer was a kind of 115. Ibid., p. 35."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Ha~way Covenant Social Criticism 207 moral rudder. Without Schaeffer he was left rudderless. ” 116 The problem Koop faced was the problem all of Schaeffer’s disciples faced: without biblical law, they were adrift. He had led them into Christian political activism, and now he was gone. Within a few years, so were they. Schaeffer’s son-in-law, Udo Middleman, buried in 1987 what was left of the movement’s theological remains. In a rambling, jargon- filled essay — toothless and feckless — he issued the standard assertion that Christians “are not called to reestablish the OT kingdom in any form. . . .“ He went on, not all that clearly: “Calling out of a broken situation and working with a ‘living God’ rather than an established law of the Medes and the Persians, the Bible speaks of things that may well be out of the grasp of people while being presented to their reach >~117 What does this mean? positively, it means “We’re on our own; Christians get to make things up as we go along”; negatively, it means that God’s law does not constrain us. Stylistically, it means that when you are trying to abandon biblical ethics in the name of the Bible, you may be tempted to try to cover your tracks by substi- tuting such terms as ‘broken situation” for public evil and “law of the Medes and Persians” for God’s Bible-revealed law. Without faith in the law of God or faith in the victory of God’s people in history (the “Church Age”), what else should we have ex- pected from that short-lived movement? Or any other Christian movement, for that matter? Political Pluralism and Christian Pessimism Theocracy means simply that God rules: theos (God) kratos (rules). The kingdom of God’s rule extends to every area of life, not just politics. Should Christians deny that God rules, in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18)? How can a Calvinist, who affirms the abso- lute sovereignty of God over every aspect of history, deny the exist- ence of theocracy? Should Christians deny that the ethical life of each person is supposed to conform progressively to God’s written law as his personal sanctification progresses and he matures in the faith? Of course not. But this raises the key question: By what stan- 116. Rutheglord Institute (Spring 1989), p. 15. 117. Udo W.

Whose law is to set the standards of ethical performance? God’s or man’s? The answer has to be: God’s revealed law. Having accepted this in principle, why should Christians then deny that the life of each covenanted imtitution is also supposed to con- form progressively to the written requirements of God’s law as its corporate sanctification increases and it matures in the faith? Yet they do deny it, by the millions, generation after generation. They simply refuse to think through the obvious implications of their faith. They may even be willing to make the intellectual jump from per- sonal covenants to God’s voluntary corporate covenants of Church and family, but not to the State. They therefore deny the possibility y of the progressive sanctification of the State. And because they fully understand that the State exercises the greatest visible power of any human institution, their unwillingness to admit the future progres- sive sanctification of the State leads them straight into eschatological pessimism: premillennialism or amillennialism. The world’s evil- doers will progressively conquer the instruments of civil power, they proclaim, and there is nothing in the long run that Christians can do about it. This truncated version of Christianity proclaims the theology of the rescue mission. The institutional Church is seen as little more than a giant rescue mission to the bums of the world. To pessimillen- nialists, the whole world is skid row, and it will surely get worse as time goes by. The bums who visibly run this world can never be sobered up, nor can they ever be replaced by sober Christians. Pessi- millennialists are saying that the inescapable theocracy of God’s rule over the universe will not be progressively manifested in civil gov- ernment or the vast majority of contractual institutions on earth un- til Jesus comes again in person, either to set up a millennial kingdom (premillennialism) or His eternal kingdom (amillennialism). Yet they also realize that there i~ no neutrali~. But if Christians can- not rule institutionally, then humanists and non-Christians will rule. The humanists will inevitably rule in the name of their god, autono- mous man. There is no escape from the concept of theocracy. The only question is: Which god is sovereign? Thus, a denial of biblical theocracy in history (pre-second coming) inescapably leads to the theological and emotional acceptance of a hurnanih theocracy or some other imitation god’s political rule in “the Church Age .“ Those who deny the historic possibility of the progressive sanctification of civil government must therefore also deny the existence in New Testa-"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Ha~way Covenant Social Criticism 209 ment times of positive feedback between covenantal faithfulness to God’s revealed law and God’s external blessings in history (Deut. 28:1-14). Implicitly or explicitly, this is exactly what they do deny. They necessarily remove the institutional covenantal sanctions and promises from the New Testament era. The Old Testament then be- comes God’s discarded first draft. This hostile attitude regarding the legitimacy of specified Old Testament covenant sanctions in civil government eventually spills over into Church government and family government. “We’re under grace, not law” is a misleading slogan that cannot be bottled up in the realm of civil government; it reflects an attitude corrosive of all government: self-government, family government, and Church gov- ernment. Thus, we find that biblical antinomianism — hostility to God’s revealed law – becomes either libertinism or legalism, and sometimes both. The best example of this dual process is fundamen- talism’s hostility to tobacco and liquor — “Never, ever, for any reason!” — and its institutional tolerance of adultery, especially by pastors. They may click their tongues, but they often do not permanently de- frock their adulterous leaders. (Since fundamentalist pastors rarely wear robes in the pulpit, the word ‘defrock” has no visual reference- point to them.) At most, the denomination or local church suspends them for a period. 118 And when the adulterous pastors refuse to sub- mit even to this, which is most of the time, they are not publicly ex- communicated as rebellious church members, but are only removed quietly from the group’s ministerial responsibilities. 119 In some 118. Internationally known television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart visited a prosti- tute for over a year in Louisiana. This was publicly exposed in early 1988 by another pastor whose sexual life had also been corrupt, and whose large ministry had disin- tegrated when he had been exposed publicly by Swaggart. (It is not wise to consort with a prostitute who operates within a mile of the man whose career you destroyed with a similar accusation. ) The Assemblies of God denomination suspended Swaggart for a year. This preposterously mild tap on the wrist was too hard for Swaggart, who left his denomination in protest and continued to run his disintegrating worldwide ministry. This is what virtually all of them do. The modern Church pays no atten- tion to God’s sanctions (blessings and cursings) that accompany the Lord’s Supper, so excommunication means little to either church governments or the excommuni- cated members. The idea that God brings His sanctions in history appeals to them only when dealing with their rivals. Nevertheless, their ministries never full y recover. Incredibly, Charles R. Fontaine and Lynda K. Fontaine have written a defense of Swaggart against the Assemblies of God, Jimmy Swa@art: To Obty God Rather Than Men (Crockett, Texas: Kerruso, 1989). 119.

In short, “Keep him away from our wives; other husbands must take their chances !“ 120 Should we be surprised when we find’that this denial of covenant sanctions in history eventually undermines pastors’ own leadership? It destroys their own institutional continuity. This is why both amil- lennialism and premillennialism are doomed. Their theologians in- sist that Christianity (pre-second coming) is doomed to failure and progressive impotence, and their followers act accordingly. Their view of ethics inevitably affects their view of historical progress. Denying Deuteronomy’s covenantal cause-and-effect relationship between ethics and God’s judgments in history, pessimillennialists thereby commit institutional suicide. Ideas do have consequences. Why This Chapter? Until Francis Schaeffer arrived on the scene, there was literally not a single nationally known Bible-believing intellectual leader in American Protestantism after the death of J. G resham Machen on New Year’s Day in 1937. There had been a gap in America’s Prot- estant leadership that lasted almost a full generation. There were conservative theological books defending this or that circumspectly limited theological doctrine – written primarily by Lutherans or faculty members of Machen’s Presbyterian Westminster Theological Seminary – as well as Bible commentaries, but there was barely a six-day creationist movement and no visible conservative Christian activism, political or otherwise. Protestant Christianity disappeared as an intellectual force in the United States early in the second term of President Franklin Roosevelt, and did not reappear until several years after the assassination of President John Kennedy in 1963. It did not emerge as a major political force nationally until the 1976 Presidential election (Carter vs. Ford), when fundamentalist Chris- ers, when each of them refused to submit to the denomination. Bakker never showed up to the formal hearing, and Swaggart refused to obey the denomination’s one-year ban from preaching. The only sanction was the erasure of their names from the de- nomination’s ministerial rolls. 120. I am not exaggerating.

(1959), was a full-scale attack on humanist thought, but it was disguised as a narrowly theological book on apologetics, which was hardly a popular topic. His books that followed began to reveal the broad range of his thought: Intellectual Schizophrenia (1961), The Alessianic Character of American Education (1963), This Independent Repub- lic (1964), The Nature of the American System (1965), Freud (1965), The Mytholo~ of Science (1967), and so on. He wrote in the 1960’s mainly on the topics of history and education. The Institutes of Biblical Law appeared in 1973, after Schaeffer’s books had begun to soften the re- sistance to intellectual Christianity in evangelical circles. Rush- doony’s books were published by tiny Craig Press (Presbyterian & Reformed), and they did not sell well. Most of them were allowed to go out of print. ’22 The major intellectual transformation in the evangelical and fun- damentalist communities came with the publication of Schaeffer’s The God Who Is There. This book appeared in 1968, when the counter- culture had become a worldwide phenomenon. This was thirty-one years after the death of Machen. The period 1965-71 was the crucial period for fundamentalists to re-enlist in the battle for the minds of men in the West — their best opportunity since the Scopes “Monkey Trial” of 1925, which the fundamentalists had lost to the evolutionists in the court of public opinion. Now, in the aftermath of Kennedy’s assassination and the Vietnam War, conventional liberalism was coming visibly unglued.

Liberals were aghast; two of their favorite proposed solutions – pub- lic higher education and federal legislation (the Civil Rights Act of 1964) – had failed to bring peace to the campus or the ghetto. Schaeffer spoke out with a series of intelligent though limited critiques of modern humanist thought and culture. He offered no Bible-based solutions, for he had neither eschatological hope nor a developed social theory, but at least he pointed eloquently to the root causes of the philosophical, moral, artistic, cultural, and political problems of the modern world: the denial of the God of the Bible. His writings began to attract the attention of Christians in many camps: evangelical, fundamentalist, and traditionally Reformed. They recognized the value of a uniquely Christian approach to social criticism. Meanwhile, dispensationalist premillennialists committed intel- lectual suicide when they failed to direct scholarly or practical atten- tion to the fundamental political and cultural issues raised by the counter-culture. They offered no explicitly Bible-based answers to real-world questions of the day. They offered no social theory con- sistent with dispensational eschatology. Most important, they offered no cause-and-effect criticism of humanist civilization that was based on a detailed study of that civilization in terms of biblical standards. When dispensationalist theologians remained silent in this crucial moment of cultural opportunity, they implicitly pub- lished their own manifesto, The Movement That Isn’t Quite Here. Then came Hal Lindsey’s Late Great Planet Earth (1970), an implicit defense of traditional dispensational retreat, but magnified: we were supposedly running out of time. Jesus would return soon, probably in 1981. There was therefore no possibility of successful Christian social action: not enough time. Better (and easier! ) to hand out gospel tracts on the beach. Surf’s up! This deafening dispensational silence on the biblical basis of social action has continued since 1971, and has been made into a worldview by Lindsey’s paperback successor. 123 This silence doomed the dispensational movement far more surely than the com- pletion of the State of Israel’s first forty years (1948-1988) – popular dispensationalism’s “generation of the fig tree” – without the prom- 123.

These introductory books were in fact lengthy essays that had been edited from his taped lectures; they were nevertheless regarded as heavy reading by most evangeli- cal. These books led to a revived interest in social action by funda- mentalists, 1976-84, after half a century of intellectual hibernation. 125 Only the leftist Siderite movement (Protestantism’s mild-mannered version of liberation theology) was generally regarded as an activist evangelical alternative to Schaeffer’s anti-abortionism in this period. 126 These movements were the two major American Protes- tant intellectual alternatives to Christian Reconstructionism, and by 1985, they had both begun to fade, at least in the United States. ’27 The Next Phase The overnight disappearance of the Schaeffer movement opened up the Christian intellectual community to Christian Reconstsmctionism, a fact which by 1986 had become far clearer to the modernist Christian left~28 124. A classic document relating to the end of popular dispensationalism was the May 1988 issue of the dispensational magazine, Moody Month~, which was devoted to “Israel at 40: A Nation in Midlife Crisis.” It included a highly revealing admission of defeat, Garry Friesing’s article, “A Return Visit,” a mild but devastating critique of Hal Lindsey’s failed prophecy regarding the forty-year generation of the fig tree. In January 1988, I launched a new newsletter, Dispensationalism in Transition, with an issue devoted to “1988: Dispensationalism’s Year of Crisis .“ I did not know that in the summer of 1988, one Edgar C. Whisenant would self-publish his “two books in one” predicting the Rapture sometime between September 11 and 13, 1988, nor would I have guessed that it would sell over four million copies and become front-page news.

One side was evangelical yet personal: he attracted to his chalet the “up and out” children of the upper middle class, especially in the late 1960’s, when they wandered aimlessly around Europe in search of adventure, meaning, and purpose. He led many of them to Christ. Another side was intellectual: he became a self-educated critic of humanism, especially the arts. He taught himself a great deal about many fields, although he did not meet the intellectual standards of tenured neo-evangelical professors who teach all of 9 to 12 hours a week, earn fat salaries, take four months of paid vacation each year, conduct no evangelism programs, counsel no wandering “riff- raff,” and have lots of time to read obscure journal articles written by specialists. He wrote books aimed at literate Christians. He surprised every- one, especially his publisher, InterVarsity Press, when he found that market far larger than anyone had imagined. How he accomplished this is as much a mystery as how the Beatles did what they did or Hal Lindsey did what he did. All of a sudden, there were buyers of rather sophisticated books on Bible-believing Christianity and modern cul- ture, and Schaeffer’s reputation as a scholar began to spread. He be- came a scholar through the back door. This sometimes showed, but it rarely mattered. 135.

He showed them that they could remain Christians without sacrificing their intellects. He thereby broke the spell of an influential humanist myth as well as a paralyzing evangelical suspicion, a myth that had prevailed since at least the Scopes trial of 1925.136 Schaeffer performed an intellectual service for the evangelical world comparable to what Henry” Morris and the Creation Science movement performed for fundamentalism: he encouraged Christian laymen by providing footnotes. The trouble was, he did not always provide all the footnotes. He deliberately concealed from his readers the most theologically radical of his sources, meaning the most Cahinistic. Theological Schizophrenia There was something dark and somewhat mysterious in the thinking of Francis Schaeffer — a kind of ominous foreboding about the movement he had launched. The cultural, political, and above all covenantal issues threatened to get out of hand. I think they did get out of hand, just as they did for Jerry Falwell and the now-defunct Moral Majority, as well as for the presently invisible New Christian Right. They were trapped from the beginning by their intellectual schizophrenia, as I wrote in 1982: I feel sorry for those visible leaders of the New Christian Right who have to face the savage attacks of the humanists, and who also face the mor- alistic attacks of those former supporters who are remaining true to their anti-covenantal, anti-political presuppositions. The radical independents are upset that men like Falwell and [James] Robison are challenging them with new, unfamiliar responsibilities — responsibilities that are meaningful only within a Christian framework of covenant theology. But neither Fal- well nor Robison believes in covenant theology. . . . The Baptists who are influential in the New Christian Right movement are being torn apart, epistemologically speaking. Their politiczd conclusions lead straight into covenantal theocracy, but their Anabaptist presuppositions lead right back into pietism and ultimately into anarchism. Once a man acknowledges that there is no neutrality, he has to confront this crucial intellectual problem. Will it be covenant theology or Anabaptism? Will it be theocracy or anar- chism? Or will it be a life of being caught in the middle, with humanists and 136.

A local charismatic layman had supposedly chased the demons out of his life, as Robison described it in 1981, and Robison was never the same. He became a spokesman for a the- ology of zero confrontations among Christians. In 1984, Schaeffer died, having lost the support of thousands of his pietist disciples be- cause of The Great Evangelical Disaster. By 1985, Falwell had left the visible political scene; in the summer of 1989, he shut down the Moral Majority, his political action organization (which had been all but dead since at least 1984). None of these men ever resolved this theological dilemma. 138 Returning Ha&ay to the Covenant Schaeffer’s criticism of modern humanist culture forced him in principle back to a doctrine he had been taught in seminary: the cov- enant. But rather than just a Church covenant — the circumscribed topic of seminary classrooms — the biblical covenant is also civil. The concept of God’s kingdom on earth threatened Schaeffer’s views about both ethics and eschatology, just as it had threatened Van Til’s view. Van Til could hide inside the Westminster Seminary library, protesting that culture was not his field, pretending that his refutation of natural law theory had not in principle unleashed the theocratic whirlwind. Because of the nature of Schaeffer’s chosen arena of intel- lectual confrontation, he could not hide from tough cultural questions that could only be answered in one of two ways: either the biblical covenant or the myth of neutrality (natural law or existentialism). He feared the first and publicly denied the second. Then his fear over- came him, and he dejectedly re-adopted the second alternative, in the form of political pluralism. He died without resolving the dilemma. 137. North, “Intellectual Schizophrenia of the New Christian Right ,“ C/zristianz’~ and Civilization (1982), pp. 29-30. 138.

In his popular writings, he never mentioned the fundamental doctrines of the Calvinist faith, such as predestination, irresistible grace, limited atonement, and covenant theology, all of which he had affirmed at the time of his ordination as a Presbyterian minister. (By affirming his commitment to the Westminster Confes- sion of Faith, he indirectly affirmed these doctrines. ) Remember: in 1976, he wrote a pamphlet on infant baptism, but refused to publish it in his misnamed Complete Works. Was this refusal strictly tactical, i.e., a means of keeping his mainly Baptist audience happy? Or was it that he could no longer face the covenantal implications of infant baptism once he had confronted the disturbing covenantal implica- tions of political sovereignty? Consider other evidence of intellectual schizophrenia in his half- way covenant theological system: He accepted the Calvinist doctrine of the total depravity of man, yet he believed that Christians could successfully appeal to comm- only held truths as a means of evangelism of sinners. He adopted the language of Van Til’s presuppositional apologet- ics, yet he rejected the key epistemological concept in Van Til’s sys- tem: the radical and unbridgeable distinction between the covenant- keeper’s view of facts and covenant-breaker’s view of facts. He then systematically spent his career covering up the fact that he had studied under Van Til and had adopted his terminology. He gained his initial knowledge of the Christian roots of the United States from Rushdoony’s This Independent Republic, stole por- tions of Rushdoony’s research in The One and the Many almost word for word, stole the words of Chilton and Flinn almost word for word, and then gave the impression (through lack of appropriate foot- noting) that he had never heard about Christian Reconstruction. He recommended the writings of Samuel Rutherford in his defense of the moral right of Christian resistance against unlawful civil government, but he also systematically refused to mention any- thing about Rutherford’s theocratic worldview, which was the theo- logical basis of Rutherford’s theory of lawful resistance. He rejected the myth of neutrality, but then adopted as his rec- ommended political ideal the concept of pluralism, which rests phi- losophically and judicially on the doctrine of neutrality. He warned against the moral implications and actual social results of political pluralism; nevertheless, he adopted pluralism’s operating presupposition: the rejection of biblical theocracy."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Hal&oay Covenant Social Criticism 219 He wrote: ‘We must not confuse the Kingdom of God with our country. To say it another way: We should not wrap Christianity in our national flag.’” But because he dared even to mention the inesca- pable implication of pluralism – moral relativism — he has been post- humously ridiculed by “academic gentlemen” in Christian college classrooms, who insist that he was a “closet theocrat” anyway. He called Christians to a life of risky confrontation with the State over the abortion question, but as a premillennialist, he believed that all such crusades are in the long run futile culturally. He attacked the social and political apathy of the modern pietis- tic evangelical world, which promptly abandoned him because it shared his premillennial, antinomian worldview. The pietists knew enough not to get involved in a losing political battle that Schaeffer’s own premillennialism implied was futile. Why get involved in poli- tics anyway? To quote Schaeffer, “There is no New Testament basis for a linking of church and state until Christ, the King returns. The whole ‘Constantine mentality’ from the fourth century up to our day was a mistake.” Both his son and Dr. Koop apparently understood what this meant, and therefore quit the fight as soon as he was dead. His son produced a violent R-rated movie. Dr. Koop abandoned every public trace of Christian morality to became a pitchman for condoms and a promoter of a national no-smoking campaign (Prohibition revisited). Although he was a political conservative, his few remaining intellectual disciples have refused to get involved in politically con- servative causes, and in fact now appear to be in the camp of the political liberals (e.g., those aligned with England’s John R. Stott). Conclusion Such has been the fate of what was originally an implicitly conser- vative Christian ministry that had adopted an essentially negative, critical approach to culture: the rejection of humanism, the rejection of biblical law, the rejection of the idea of a national covenant, and the rejection of the possibility of building a Christian civilization before the second coming of Christ. Like the amillennialists Van Til and Dooyeweerd, and also like consistent premillennialists everywhere, Schaeffer had nothing positive to affirm concerning the future except the hope of a personal discontinuous escape from history: either death or the second coming of Christ, whichever comes first. For Schaeffer, death came first."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"220 POLITICAL POLYTHEISM In short, Francis Schaeffer’s ministry ran head-on into the hard reality of the old political slogan: ‘You can’t beat something with nothing.” In a time of intellectual and social disintegration, which this century surely is, those clinging desperately to the collapsing center cannot be expected to, do much more than hold on for dear life. The collapsing center surely cannot pave the way to a better temporal world when it is unable to hold things together. Without hope for the earthly future, Francis Schaeffer could not persuade the bulk of his followers to move off-center, away from pietism: neo- evangelical, Reformed, or fundamentalist. There were only three ways out of pietism when he died: liberation theology, theocracy, and apostasy. Schaeffer rejected all three. He died before the center collapsed. It is unlikely that his spiritual heirs will escape that easily. Things could have been worse, however. Francis Schaeffer might have been a political liberal. He might even have been a trained historian.

This adjustment was to abandon — at least while working within univer- sity precincts — the tradition of providential historiography stretching back to Constantine’s Eusebius. It marked a willingness to consider history writing in the sphere of creation rather than in the sphere of grace, as a manifestation of general rather than special revelation. Put differently, Christian historians in the modern academy have made the implicit confession that history is not theology. This con- fession means that they construct their accounts of the past from facts ascertained through documentary or material evidence and ex- plained in terms of natural human relationships. Usually without defining their theoretical commitments ex- plicitly, these historians have hewn to a middle course. They have eschewed providential history; Christian historians assume that a scholar working with the data of historical research cannot know God’s mind for past events in the way that the inspired writers of Scripture did, and they assume that the primary purpose of histori- cal writing is not apologetics or evangelism. . . . With strategic adjustments by Christian historians themselves, the forceful voice of neo-orthodoxy, and the decay of grand secular explanations, the modern academy has made room for serious his- torical writing compatible with Christian values and useful for Christian purposes. Christians who write this kind of history can still fall between stools. A believer who leaves to theologians the job of assessing human events from the divine perspective can be labeled a traitor within the church. A Christian who refuses to reduce religion to a supposedly more fundamental reality can be scorned as senti- mental in the academy. Nonetheless, it is now possible to conduct such historical work in departments of religion at Princeton, Yale, Duke, Chicago, Edinburgh, Oxford, Cambridge, and other major universities of the English-speaking world, and also to function with such a perspective in the history departments of most universities.

In fact, by the time you finish this chapter, you probably will expect to see their check returned to you, with the grim notation: “insufficient funds .“ Two other bothersome questions may also intrude into the mind of a thoughtful Christian. Fir$t, the U.S. Constitution permits amendments. This allows for peaceful political continuity. 3 What if a large majority of voters in the United States should someday convert to Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, and then, over several decades or more, repeatedly amend the Constitution in order to reflect the pro- gressive transformation of the nation into a bottom-up, decentral- ized, theocratic republic? I am not yet raising the question of the wisdom of such a political act, though of course I would favor it under the historical conditions I have specified. I am merely raising the question of the legality of such a program of C onstitutional revi- sion. If it is legal, why not do it? If it is not legal, on what basis is it declared illegal? There is no doubt, as the authors correctly observe, that the United States is legally a pluralistic nation today. This is not the pri- mary point. The far more important question is: Is today’s political pluralism necessarily a judicially and politically permunent condition? Even more to the point: Is it Con.stitutLwud~ permanent? At what point in history may a majority of voters legitimately begin to amend the Constitution to make it conform to “the will of the People,” if those voters have become theonomists? If We, the People” should self-consciously become ‘We, God’s covenanted people,” what legal or moral principle can the pluralist offer which would prohibit the peaceful, voluntary, and majoritarian abandonment of the doctrine of political pluralism, both in word and in deed? The Myth of Neutrality (Again) So, the U.S. Constitution can be lawfully amended to revoke political pluralism. A second question occurs. On the one hand, they 3.

They do the same thing repeatedly with the word Christian. Why such hesitation adopt- ing these crucial words with the words’ full force? Why do they try to soften the power of these words by placing them inside quotation marks?) On the other hand, the authors promise that “for the pur- poses of civic deba~e and legislation we will not appeal simply to reli- gious authority.” A most intriguing goal! But their promise raises a crucial question: What authority, pray tell, is not religious? (Dr. Marsden studied apologetics under Cornelius Van Til at Westminster Seminary. He is aware of Van Til’s arguments regarding the impos- sibility of religious neutrality. At the heart of Van Til’s apologetic system is this presupposition: All authori~ is at bottom religious. There is no religious neutrality. I wonder if he has rejected Van Til’s con- clusions. I believe that he must have. How else could he have signed his name to such a statement?) Now, if our three professors of history are, as they insist, also professors of Christ, why do they believe that those who deny Christ have a leg (or an epistemology) to stand on? Every knee should bow at the name of Jesus: “That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth” (Phil. 2:10). The verse does not say that every knee shall bow at judgment day, but rather that every knee should bow today, mor- ally speaking. It is an ethical imperative, not an eschatological prophecy. So is the requirement that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord (Phil. 2:11). If our three professors are saying only that we do not need to cite the Bible every time we speak, they are saying nothing special. I can legitimately order a sandwich from a waitress without reminding her that man does not live by bread alone. (By “man” I of course mean mankind, as in “the family of man.” I include women in my use of the word here. No need to offend liberal academic sensibilities at this early stage !) But our three professors mean something a bit more substantial. What they are talking about is common grace: the ability of non-Christians to understand logical arguments even though they reject the Bible, God, and Christianity. 5 4. Ibid., p. 44. 5.

He restrains them from becoming totally consistent with their own covenant-breaking presuppositions. Should they ever become totally consistent, they could not think at all, Van Til insisted, for they have borrowed (stolen! ) from Christianity every premise that allows them to think clearly. 6 Consistency and ConJict The question must then be raised: If covenant-breakers should steadily become more consistent with their religious presuppositions, would they continue to listen to Christians who have adopted the authors’ hoped-for common-ground arguments? Or to put it another way, once covenant-breakers more fully see what Jesus Christ really demands from them in history, and they also see what consistent Christians should demand from them in civil affairs (e. g., the public execution of convicted abortionists as murderers: Exodus 21:22-23), will they not rush to shut the open door policy of the Constitution? Won’t they try to make abortions legal, for example, by means of a Supreme Court interpretation? (Oops, sorry: they already did this.) And if that should be overturned by legislation or a subsequent Court decision, will they try to replace the Constitution (as several humanist groups are now actively seeking to do)? 7 In short, as covenant-breakers and covenant-keepers become more consistent with their rival and’ irreconcilable religious positions over time, what happens to the reality of pluralism’s judicially open door? More to the point, isn’t the primary premise of political plural- ism the assumption that men will become progressively more self- conscious religiously over time? What if C. S.

Good is always getting better and bad is always getting worse: the possibilities of even apparent neutrality are always dimin- ishing.

What becomes of politicalplu- ralism in the middle of an escalating religious war? And what can prevent such a war if Lewis is correct regarding the historical process of “sharpening and hardening” in both the past and the future? 10 Let me put it bluntly: as covenant-keepers and covenant-breakers become more consistent in thought and h$e, pluralism will be shot to pieces in an io20- logical (and perhaps even litera~ cross~re. Pluralism is a political arrange- ment based on a temporary religious and ideological cease-fire. When this cease-fire ends, pluralism also ends. So will the appeal of its ideology. Each time a Christian presses the claims of the gospel on a fallen world, he makes plain the irreconcilable differences. This is true no matter what he does to “soften the punch.” Thus, we can expect escalating confrontations as time goes on if Christians preach and live the gospel, until the final assault on the Church at the end of time (Rev. 20:9-10). But in the meantime, who becomes dominant: the covenant-breaker or the covenant-keeper? Our trio of historians believes that covenant-breakers will; I believe that Christians will. This may sound like a peripheral debate over eschatology, but it is at the very center of our conflicting views of American history, as we shall see. Because our authors do not want to provoke unbelievers, they prefer to avoid pressing God’s claims on them in the field of civil government. They have reinterpreted colonial American history in order to justify their call for Christians to withdraw from the political arena as people with an explicitly Christian political agenda. 9. C. S.

Their world was destroyed in princi- ple by Christ’s incarnation, ministry, and resurrection. “He that lov- eth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me” (v. 37).

Not “the reasonable” case laws, but all of them, taken as a package, unless one of them has been an- nulled by the New Testament? This question requires no heavily footnoted answer.

The present Western theocracies of autonomous man will not tolerate such opposition. This poses a problem for the vast majority of academically em- ployed Christians. Their academic peers are liberals. Or Marxists. So, they are in no position to defend publicly, let alone promote, the legislative enactment of Old Testament law. Nevertheless, they claim to be Christians. There is only one acceptable tactic: to deny that the case laws are binding in New Testament times. (They share this viewpoint with 99.9 percent of all covenant-breakers, excluding only a few cults. ) But without the case laws, there is no way to distin- guish Christian legislation from non-Christian legislation. Chris- tians in academic positions understand this, so they conclude that there can be no legitimate Christian civil legislation. Then they set out to prove it. Any other conclusion would be regarded by their present employers as an unacceptable narrowing of the Christian worldview, and it would also lead rapidly to a drastic narrowing of their career opportunities. It is the contention of theonomists that the Old Testament is not “the Word of God (emeritus).” We take its laws seriously. This is why we are “persona non grata” in every Christian college faculty in the land. Our three authors do not make explicit their theological objec- tions to theonomy. They ignore theology as such.

To do this, they must assert the only logical alternative, namely, that the New Testament is inherently ambiguous –political~, economical~, and in ev~y other way.

For example, do these principles lead to the creation of a decentralized republic rather than a one-party unitary State?) They continue: “This political side of Christians’ action – whether on the political right, left, or middle – should be marked by humility. We should not too readily claim the authority of God for a political or economic program by saying that ours is the ‘Christian’ position. ”13 Note the academic hedge words, “not too readily.” Maybe there is a “Christian position” after all ! If one utterly denies this possibility y, one then appears as a moral relativist. Then again, maybe there really is no Christian position. One does not want to appear dogmatic. Dilemmas, dilemmas. The safe thing to do is to adopt loophole phrases, such as “not too readily.” (Such phrases are used by academic people far too readily.) The authors point to the fact that “the most common use of the Bible in politics has been to justify one’s own self-interests.” 14 True enough; but what if one’s own self-interests happen to be biblical? After all, isn’t the whole purpose of personal regeneration and pro- gressive moral sanctification to conform oneself and onei institutions to Christ?

Why would the addition of the adjective “political” lessen the logic of the accusa- tion? How do our three scholars expect to be able to toss the rhetori- cal acid of relativism in the faces of the Puritans as political theorists and not expect to scar them also as theologians? They affirmed the covenant in civil government; 17 they also affirmed it in Church gov- ernment. If they were incorrect regarding the former, then why not also the latter? My economic commentary on Exodus 21-23, Tools of Dominion, is over 1,200 pages long. I have thought about this more than twice. I have thought continually about this for over a quarter of a century. I have concluded that the Bible is not all that ambiguous morally or judicially. The Bible is sufficiently clear to earn it the hostility of gen- erations of humanistic political liberals.

The Dilemma of H. Richard Niebuhr The thinking of Nell, Hatch, and Marsden is intimately bound up in a vision of what constitutes Protestantism, as we shall see. What I argue in this chapter is that their conception of Protestantism 18. The Search, p. 139 19. Idem."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"HalJway Covenant Historiography 233 is essentially that of the liberal humanist, H. Richard Niebuhr, the brother of Reinhold. Reinhold was a political activist, a “realist,” a pursuer of the Kantian phenomenal realm. Z“ His brother was a pietist, a pursuer of the Kantian noumenal realm. They made quite a theo- logical team. Neither of them was a Trinitarian Christian. H. Richard Niebuhr set forth a principle of interpretation which is fundamental to The Search for Christian A mert”ca. He argued in 1937 that Protestantism faces an acute dilemma. Then he took the Kantian dilemma and baptized it. (This is what Karl Barth had begun doing two decades earlier.) The dilemma of Protestantism lay rather in these factors: it had no will to power and in view of its positive principle could have none, for supreme power belonged only to God and evil resulted from every human arrogation of his dominion; it had no definite idea of the end toward which it was traveling and could have none, since the future lay with the free God; and it could not be ruthless since it had the inhibiting commandments of the gos- pel ever before it. As a theory of divine construction the Protestant move- ment was hard put to it to provide principles for human construction. Yet it was unable to be supine, awaiting in patience what God might do, since it was evident that men lived in a crisis and that they could not stand still but were hastening either to destruction or to life. It was necessary to press into the kingdom. 21 Good relativist that he was, Niebuhr then pointed out to his readers what he found in himself “The Protestant saw how relative were the judgments about good and evil, about right and wrong, and how much the moral commandments of society were condi- tioned by the interests of the powerful.”zz Does this description sound to you like Martin Luther? No? Well, then, does it sound like John Calvin? No? How about John Knox? No? Well, then, who does it sound like?

The Catholic critic seemed unanswerable when he said that Protestantism led to moral anarchy.” 24 ‘ And then he drove home his point: “What was true of the moral sphere was perhaps even more true of the political and economic.”2 5 The reader is warned in advance: here is the heart, mind, and soul of modern defenses by self-professed Christians of political plu- ralism and the Keynesian mixed economy. This is the mind-set of the academic Christian today. The Bible, they insist, provides no blueprints, no moral absolutes that can be translated into historic creeds and political platforms. It is this assumption which leaves them no choice but to reject the judicial and social worldview of the Puritans in the name of modernity. They are Protestants, they tell us, and they are indeed caught in a dilemma: Kant’s dilemma. What about the Bible? Doesn’t it provide blueprints? The early New England Puritans believed it does, as Niebuhr shows. But it was a false hope, he insisted. “The equation of the Scriptures with the revealed will of God led to virtual denial of the living reality of God.’y*G Here it is again: the Kantian dilemma. To the extent that the Kantian god is said to be revealed in a phenomenal form, the Bible and creeds derived from it, to that extent does he retreat ever- deeper into the noumenal shadows.

It gives away the game. He began the essay with this observation: “One of the opinions most persistently and widely held in the American evangelical community and in many conserva- tive Reformed circles is that America had essentially Christian origins from which lamentably it turned in the twentieth century.” 30 Then he goes on: “Yet if it were shown that the Puritans who settled America did not establish truly Christian dominant cultural princi- ples that were in some important ways perpetuated, then a strong suspicion might be raised that the entire case for a now-lost Chris- tian America rests on rather nebulous foundations.”3 1 1 this can be f shown, then he is correct: the entire case for a Christian America would indeed rest on nebulous foundations. But his attempt to show this supposed failure of the Puritans falls flat. 28. DictionaT, p. 331. 29. I also took one course under Woolley.

If in theo~ it is unlikely that there can be any historical ex- amples of truly Christian cultures — the heart, mind, and soul of ‘Marsdenism” and neo-evangelical historiography generally – then of course the Puritans did not achieve a truly Christian society.

They represent “an uncommonly ideal ‘laboratory’ in which to analyze the possibilities and pitfalls of a truly Christian culture .“ 34 He also admits that “Puritan conceptions long remained major influ- ences in America.”35 He cites Church historian Sydney Ahlstrom’s recognition of the “dominance of Puritanism in the American reli- gious heritage.”qc But, asks Marsden, did they provide “a truly Christian basis for American culture?” Then he discusses the diffi- culties in defining Puritan and Christian.

The Puritans were Calvinists, he says. They believed in the sover- eignty of God. 38 They were moral people. 39 In forming a civil govern- ment, Governor John Winthrop appealed back to the Old Testament idea of covenant, with its doctrine of God’s historical sanctions against nations. A“ And here is the problem — for Marsden, not for Winthrop: “Winthrop accordingly assumed that he could transfer the principles of nationhood found in ancient Israel to the Massa- chusetts Bay Company with no need for explanation.”Al Here is the sharp object that sticks in Marsden’s throat. He cannot swallow this. If he did, he would have to equate Christian civil government with theocra~. He coughs hard and spits it out. He cites Winthrop’s “Model of Christian Charity” speech given on board the Arbella in 1630. Here, before the main body of Puritans ever set foot on American shores, is compressed in Winthrop’s thought the paradoxical character of almost the entire Puritan enterprise. They believed their vision for the transformation of human culture was grounded solely on the best principles drawn from Scripture. Yet their historical experience – a tradition of over a thousand years of living in “Christendom,” a concept that classical Protes- tantism did not dispel — led them to interpret Scripture in an ultimately pre- tentious way that gave their own state and society the exalted status of a new Israel. 42 Here is the reason why the critics of Christian Reconstruction re- gard us as pretentious. It is because any attempt to designate any culture as Christian is regarded as pretentious, if this designation is in any way tied to Old Testament law and the covenant sanctions of that law-order. Thus, says Marsden, the Puritan theory of its new Israel status produced “dubious practical consequences.” Such as? Such as: “Old Testament law was directly if not exclusively incorpor- ated into the legal systems of New England.”43 He then cites the dozen capital crimes listed in the Body of Liberties (1641). “Such laws were not all without precedent in English Common Law and else- where, yet here the Old Testament texts were copied directly into the 38.

This just about settles it, in Marsden’s eyes. New England Puri- tans were clearly not engaged in building a “truly Christian” society, since they appealed directly to the Bible in order to establish their civil laws. They assumed that they were the New Israel, and their law code testified to this assumption. But just to make sure we get the picture, he reminds us of their harsh treatment of the American Natives. (Oops, sorry: Native Americans. Capitalized.) “Nowhere do the dangers of this assumption become more clear than in the Puritans’ treatment of the Native Americans.”45 Puritans stole the Indians’ land, he says. And then he gets to the point: They regarded themselves as the new political Israel; but it was a case of mistaken identity. The result was worse than if they had made no attempt to find a Christian basis for politics. 46 Here it is, in black and white. Better not to seek becoming a Christian society than to put biblical law into your society’s civil law code. Better to live in a humanist, pluralistic society than to seek to establish a theocracy. Better to sit under the humanists’ table and eat the scraps that fall from it, even though the humanists will have taxed you heavily to put food on their table. In short, better pluralism’s civil covenant than God’s. This is the presuppositional basis of our trio’s re- @tion of the idea that America was ever a Christian nation. The Appeal to Roger Williams To whom does he then appeal as the “truly Christian” political philosopher of that generation? Roger Williams, the spiritual father of the Baptists. “Williams too may be counted among those Calvin- ists who contributed to the American heritage, though among Cal- vinists themselves he represented a minority position. In his view of the Church, Williams in a sense was more a puritan than the Puri- tans.” In what sense? In the sense that Calvin College is today “more Calvinist” than Harvard College was in 1640. That is, it is more like Wheaton College. “Thus perhaps we ought to credit Williams as the best exemplar of the truly positive Calvinist influence in American 44. Idem. 45. Ibid., p. 248. 46.

Any similarity between the Massachusetts Bay Colony or Connecticut and Rhode Island is limited to geography.” Although Dr. Marsden, a former student in Dr. Van Til’s classes, somehow failed to mention this, he has taken his readers back to natural law. Williams defended his anti-Massachusetts errand in the Rhode Island wilderness by an appeal to natural law theory.49 Like the dog returning to its vomit (II Pet. 2:22), those who adopt Van Til’s pre- suppositional apologetics without also adopting the theonomists’ view of biblical law in civil society eventually are tempted to return to Thomas Aquinas in the name of John Calvin and/or Abraham Kuyper. It is clear that Dr. Marsden is Mr. Woolley’s disciple, far more than Dr. Van Til’s. Having labeled the Puritan experiment as “paradoxical,” ending in a ‘.’maze of paradoxes,” he then labels their legacy one of “uneven foundations .”5’J He says that they really did hold to the view of bibli- cal law that Rushdoony says that they did: “. . . the law is a silent magistrate, and the magistrate a speaking law.”sl This was a higher law concept. Then he goes on to claim John Locke as part of “the next generation.” John Locke? He has jumped across 3,000 miles of ocean and two revolutions — the Puritan Revolution (1638-60) and the Glorious Revolution (1688) – in order to reach Locke. Are we being told that Locke’s natural law concept of society was part of “the next generation” of Puritans? Marsden is too clever to say this, but his move from the New England Puritans to Locke takes place within a single paragraph. From there — the same paragraph, mind you — we move back across the ocean and forward another eight and a half decades to 1776 and . . . Thomas Paine! They all held a similar view of the “higher law.” 47. Idem. 48. Cleveland was a pro-gold standard, veto-wielding defender of limited gov- ernment; Bryan was basically a Baptist who believed vaguely in infant baptism, and whose politics was anti-gold standard, Populist, and radical; Wilson was a secular humanist who believed in rule by the educated elite. 49, See below: “Roger Williams: Hero of the Pluralists,” pp. 245-54. 50.

What is sauce for the colonial goose is also sauce for the neo-evangelical gander. Marsden admits that during the Revolution, preachers identified the Revolutionary cause with the new Israel. This was a survival of Puritanism. Again, he says that this is a black mark on the churches, a visible demonstration of “Christian ideological imperialism.”5 3 Yet he still refuses to discuss the possibility that the existence of this “Christian imperialism” proves the case that this nation was origi- nally founded on Christianity.

The authors of The Search for Christian A mer- ica claim that they did not find Christian America. Since they very clearly embarked on their academic journey in order to avoid finding it, this is not surprising. They of course do not tell the reader that the absence in history of a Christian America was their intellectual starting- point. On the contrary, they insist that it was “a study of the facts” that led them to this conclusion. “We feel that a careful study of the facts of history shows that early America does not deserve to be con- sidered uniquely, distinctly or even predominantly Christian, if we mean by the word ‘Christian’ a state of society reflecting the ideals presented in Scripture. There is no lost golden age to which Ameri- can Christians may return. ”57 Furthermore, “the idea of a ‘Christian nation’ is a very ambiguous concept . . . .“ 58 (Lost Golden Age?

Indeed, although the authors do not refer to it, the civil covenant known as the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut (1639) is generally recog- nized by scholars as the very first written constitution to launch a new political unit in history. bl They do discuss the Massachusetts Body of Liberties of 1641, in which every Old Testament capital crime except sabbath-breakingGZ was brought under the civil sanction of execution. Predictably, they are hostile to such a covenant document. They begin their discussion of the Body of Liberties with this dubious statement: “But these positive accomplishments were offset by more dubious practical con- sequences.

In short, the best single piece of evidence that New England was self-consciously, covenantally Christian be- comes, in their pluralist hands, evidence that it was not Christian. Because New England looked back to Old Testament Israel as their judicial model, New England was being untrue to Christ. A New Israel In the section “A New Israel,” the authors cite the presence of bib- lical case laws as a major problem — not for their thesis, but rather for New England’s claim to be Christian. “The central problem, however, immediately presented itself when Winthrop, the civil gov- ernor, attempted to apply the summary of the law to the entire soci- ety of Massachusetts Bay. While he made the distinction between justice, which should be expected in any society, and mercy, to be found in Christian associations, he clearly considered the entire Massachusetts society as such to be essentially Christian.”G4 Notice carefully the direction in which their argument is headed. “Most ironically, probably the principal factor turning the Puritan cultural achievement into a highly ambiguous one was the very concept that is the central theme of this chapter — the idea that one can create a truly Christian culture .“65 In short, because Winthrop regarded Massachusetts Bay as a Christian culture, we know that it could not possibly have been a “truly” Christian culture. Truly, theirs is a strange argument. Think about it. Does it sound strange to you? They are arguing that precisely because the New England Puritans sought the establishment of a self-consciously biblical civil government, it could not therefore have been tn+ Christian. If you think this sounds weird, then you have already concluded that it must not be inherently anti-Christian (or “not ‘truly’ Christian”) for a society to pursue the establishment of a Bible-based covenant which embraces the fundamental principle of biblical law, including Old Testament law.

Winthrop cited Deuteronomy 30 in his “Model of Christian Charity” speech on board the good ship Arbella as the little band of Puritans sailed toward New England in 1630. He stated that they were “entered into Covenant with him for the worke. . . .” He cited the presence of God’s sanctions, blessings and cursings, which are dependent on God’s covenant law.

On the contrary, they saw New Eng- land as the latest in a long series of national conversions. But the authors do not explain this. They make it appear as though the Puri- tans were somehow radically nationalistic. The authors feel com- pelled to stop such an “Israelite” idea from spreading abroad. In effect, these scholars are involved in a job of putting the Puritans’ light under a bushel (Matt. 5:15). They are not the first scholars to do SO. Roger Williams: Hero of the Pluralists This insistence that Israel must be regarded as historically unique, and in no way should be regarded as a legitimate covenantal model for New Testament civil governments, was basic to Roger Williams’ denial of the civil order of Massachusetts Bay. He sent a long letter (now missing) to Governor Winthrop in 1637, the year fol- lowing his flight to the wilderness of Rhode Island, in which he in- sisted on “the differences between Israel and all other states .“ 70 (He was careful always to issue his blasts against hierarchical authority only after he had removed himself from the jurisdiction of his intended targets, a remarkably common practice of separatists down through the ages. They hate hierarchical authority, but they recognize it. ) Williams’ spiritual heirs today control the institutions of Chris- tian higher learning. It is not surprising that Williams has for cen- turies been the darling of the anti-Christian humanists who reject the Bible’s explicit theocracy in their quest to establish autonomous man’s implicit theocracy. What may be initially surprising is that he has had so many allies in the Christian camp. Why should this be? Why should he have supporters in both camps? Because there is now, and always has been, an operating political and philosophical alliance between the escape religion of Christian pietism and the power religion of humani~m, the same sort of alliance that operated between Israel’s elders in Egypt and the tyrannical Pharaoh. It is based on the sup- posedly shared principles of civic morality (for example, the com- mon rejection of execution as the appropriate civil sanction against first-degree murder). The pietists, as always, warn the theocratic dominionists: “The L ORD look upon you, and judge; because you have made our savour 70, Cited by Perry Miller, Rogo Williams: (New York: Atheneum, [1953] 1965), p. 42.

The taskmasters then use it to keep the slaves orderly, until the restraints of natural law grow too restrictive, whereupon the taskmasters abandon any pretence of adhering to natural law, and they return to the pure version of the power religion. (In the ‘West, this took place in the generation after Darwin’s natural selec- tion philosophy elevated “man, the planner” into power, while simul- taneously destroying any remaining traces of humanist philosophical support for natural law theory. )71 For many years, naive Christian pietists have chosen to go along with this self-deception, still dreaming of a pluralistic republic based on common neutral principles of civic morality. They “go along to get along,” to cite the late Speaker of the House, ‘Mr. Sam” Rayburn. The humanists’ version of common morality has become dominant in the Christian camp. Where Christian pietists once joined human- ists in a common rejection of murder, they become willing to accept, however belatedly, the taskmasters’ position on abortion, all for the sake of the fading pluralist alliance. The Christians sell their birthright for a mess of suffrage. Parn”ngton’s Political Interpretation The radical humanist literary historian Vernon L. Barrington was utterly hostile to the Puritans and a great fan of Williams. His intellectual influence was dominant in the field of Puritan studies un- til Perry Miller, another specialist in American literature, arrived on the scene in the early 1930’s. Barrington rhapsodized about Williams: “A child of light, he came bringing not peace but the sword. A humane and liberal spirit, he was groping for a social order more generous than any theocracy – that should satisfy the aspirations of men for a catholic fellowship, greater than sect or church, village or nation, embracing all races and creeds, bringing together the sun- dered societies of men in a common spirit of good will.”72 In short, 71.

Williams’ groping for universal good will turned him into a fire- brand, as Barrington described him. Williams’ intellectual heritage, Barrington said, later manifested itself in Transcendentalism, Unitarianism, and the political philosophy of Thomas Paine. 73 I be- lieve Barrington. Why don’t Christian pluralists believe him? 74 Why don’t they perceive where Williams’ natural law doctrines, coupled with his “inner light” doctrines, lead to? Or do they seriously believe that they can “clean up” a few “minor deviations” in Williams’ politi- cal philosophy, thereby making it suitable throughout the ages for Christians to support? If they really believe this, then where is the evidence that Williams’ doctrines can be cleaned up? Where is a body of consistently biblical and equally consistent pluralist political philosophy which reconciles the two positions? It does not exist, as well our pluralist historians know, which is why they turn to Deists and non-Trinitarians to defend their cherished pluralist faith, as we shall see. Why, for that matter, do Christian pluralists refuse to acknowledge the truth about natural law’s atheist or at least pantheist founda- tions? Historian Paul Hazard is forthright in his chapter on natural law: “Natural law was the offspring of a philosophy which rejected the supernatural, the divine, and substituted, for the acts and pur- poses of a personal God, an immanent form of nature.”Ts Because to acknowledge this would reveal the nature of the deadly compromise that Christian social philosophy has made with the enemies of God, and faithful Christian people in the pews and (even more fearfully) the voting booth might at last abandon any such ties. To reject the hybrid philosophy of natural law necessarily brings Christians face to face with the question of the continuing authority of Old Testa- ment law. This, above all, is what our pluralist Christian academi- cians wish to avoid.

It was not strictly as a theologian that he gained his pri- mary reputation in history; it was as a political philosopher. He was “a forerunner of Locke and the natural-rights school, one of the most notable democratic thinkers that the English race has produced. . . . He was a social innovator on principle, and he left no system unchal- lenged. . . .” His pluralist political legacy is the one promoted in the name of Christianity by our trio. Wrote Barrington: Broadly, the development of his thought falls into three stages: the substitu- tion of the compact theory of the state for divine-right theory; the rejection of the suppositions compact of the earlier school and the fictitious abstract state — still postulated by many thinkers — and the supposition of a realistic conception of the political state as the sovereign repository of the social will, and the government — or agent of the state — as the practical instrument of society to effect its desired ends; and, finally, the difficult problem of creat- ing a democratic commonwealth, as the exigencies of the Rhode Island ex- periment required. . . . In his substitution of the compact theory for divine right, Williams was brought face to face with the fundamental assumption of the Massachusetts theocracy, based on numerous passages of Scripture, that the political state is established by the God of the Hebrews. . . ,77 Getting even closer to the pluralist hearts of our trio, Barrington asserted, quite correctly, that “he accepted the major deductions 76. It is interesting that the major American universities in the 1950’s and 1960’s used the sabbatical year concept in their tenure track system. If an assistant pro- fessor was not elevated in his eighth year to associate professor, he did not gain per- manent tenured (lifetime guaranteed) employment. These days, there are so many unemployed Ph. D’s available that tenure is seldom granted, because of wage con- siderations. Assistant professors are cheap. Thus, a perverse ranking system that was supposed to assure professors lifetime employment and power against the ad- ministration has backfired: it has destroyed lifetime academic employment for all but a few, making permanent the system of “indentured servitude.” The untenured professor goes from university to university seeking but never finding the shelter of guaranteed lifetime income. This system keeps aging assistant professors publicly humble and orthodox in their humanism, which is appropriate for their subordinate position. They do not challenge their masters. What was originally promoted as a system of academic freedom to encourage professorkd intellectual independence has become visibly a system of academic suppression.

Those who did not consent could leave, which Williams did, rapidly, when he learned that he was about to be deported back to England. What alienated Williams, and what continues to alienate his spiri- tual and political heirs, is that the Puritans assumed that only those who professed faith in Christ and who were members of a church would be allowed by civil law to interpret and apply the civil laws of God. Why did they assume this? Because they understood the gov- erning principle of representation in a biblical holy commonwealth: #anyone refuses to a~rm public~ that he is under Go&s historical and eternal sanctions, he has no lawful right to enforce God3 civil laws on others. This was a recognized principle in American courts until the twentieth century: atheists, not believing in God’s final judgment, were not allowed to testify in many state courts. In short, the Puritans held to covenant theology: a sovereign God who rules hierarchically through human representatives in terms of His revealed law. The rulers are required by God to bring sanctions in God’s name against individu- als who violate God’s civil law. Why? In order to keep God from bringing far worse sanctions on the whole society. But modern com- mentators, including our trio, deny either explicitly or implicitly that God brings such corporate sanctions in history. Thus, hypothetically neutral political pluralism seems safe and sound rather than full of sound and fury — fury against God’s law. Pluralism and Natural Law TheoV Perry Miller and most modern historians fault Barrington for viewing Williams as a political theorist rather than as a theologian, 79 but this is not to say that Barrington’s assessment of the Williams’ operational legacy was incorrect. Williams is still remembered by most Americans even today, if he is remembered at all, as the perse- cuted saint who challenged the dour political theocracy of the - Mas- sachusetts Bay Colony.

Williams understood far better than his modern pluralist dis- ciples that you cannot beat something with nothing. He left a unique political legacy. Deny its presuppositions – natural law theory and the myth of neutrality — and you must logically reject his political philosophy. But logic is not always a man’s dominant concern. In this transi- tional era, Christian social philosophers – e. g., Van Til, Schaeffer, and our trio — cannot bring themselves to go beyond the first stage of reconstruction: the denial of Williams’ first principles, natural law and the neutrality doctrine. Thus, they remain intellectual y schizo- phrenic and dualistic – heart-mind dualism, law-grace dualism, spiritual-secular dualism, politics-religion dualism, heaven-earth dualism – or remain silent on real-world issues, or disappear from the scene, or else decide to accept the myth of neutrality after all. But what they categorically refuse to do is to publish a detailed, docu- mented, Bible-based, cogently argued presentation of the hoped-for, longed-for, and implicitly promised reconciliation of inevitably non- neutral Christianity and political pluralism. Williams could not write it, and this inability was not simply because, in the words of Perry Miller, “we may well doubt that he could ever construct a sus- tained logical argument of his own . . . .“ 81 It was because the two worldviews are theologically irreconcilable. Pluralism is the philoso- phy of the temporary cease-fire; in contrast, Christianity is the reli- gion of escalating historical confrontation, to be followed by God’s eternal sanctions. Humanism is also a religion of escalating confron- tation. The debate between Christianity and humanism is over which side will win this confrontation. Williams us.

The Puritans were “non-separating Congregationalists,” and Williams could not tolerate this. 83 He moved to Salem, and from there to Plymouth, the colony of the true separatists. He fled Plymouth in 1633. The Plymouth church, he said, was not suffi- ciently separatist. When visiting England, its members attended the Church of England. Too lax! 84 He returned to Salem. Once outside of Plymouth’s jurisdiction, he wrote a letter to Plymouth, telling the authorities that they had no legal title to their land because they had not purchased it from the Indians (see below). At Salem, he was again offered a pastorate, and he took it. (Why no concerns about its prior imperfection this time? Employment opportunities? A “bully pulpit” of a pulpit?) He fled Massachusetts in 1636 because the mag- istrates were about to send him back to England. Only after this did he begin his war of the pamphlets with Massachusetts. But he was careful always to flee the jurisdiction of the court he was about to savage. He understood the reality of hierarchy, and he hated it. Here is the heart and soul of Williams’ thought and early life: not his theology, not his political philosophy, but his hatred of couenantal hi- erarchies. He rejected point two of the biblical covenant model. He wanted no intermediary between his conscience and God’s mind. God was to speak to Williams and everyone else directly, which meant that God had to remain silent in public. Williams was in principle an early theologian of Novak’s empty temple. When Williams began to preach publicly that the King’s patent was invalid and that the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay, like the Pilgrims of Plymouth, also had no valid titles to their land, and when he began saying that the Church of England was not a true church, he was brought under suspicion. He was attacking the King and the magistrates. He was attacking the English Church. In short, k WU.S attacking the fabric of English sociep.

He then per- suaded others of his view. 85 Next, he said that regenerate men and unregenerates should not pray together, and this included praying with wife and children. There should be no prayers of thanks after meals. All of Salem was aglow with his strange ideas. The colony was ready to split. What saved it from a split was that Williams continued on and on, claim- ing that all the churches of Massachusetts had given up congrega- tional independence and were therefore not true churches. 86 He rapidly lost his support, and when threatened with deportation to England, he fled. He rejected hierarchy, and he rejected the legitimacy of civil covenant sanctions. But this was not enough. He had to attack the hierarchical Church covenant, too. A few followers joined him in Providence. There, he became a Baptist. He would no longer bap- tize infants. He had himself and his followers rebaptized. But was this baptism valid? No, he then concluded, they must wait for God to raise up a new apostolic power. He withdrew from the church, and would take communion only with his wife. But then he reversed himself. He would not take the~nal step in his war against hierarchy, i.e., abandon his fami(y couenant.

He finally concluded that no church can at- tain purity in this world, which is what the Church of England and John Winthrop had always maintained.

They in- sist on the rights of conscience, yet they defend the sovereignty of political majorities. They promote political pluralism, a political phi- losophy which allows its own suicide by majority vote. They deny the myth of neutrality, yet they also deny the legitimacy of theocracy. They insist that man has been given common grace in order to think clearly by means of natural-law categories, yet they also say that common grace is being removed as men become increasingly mor- ally perverse. They say that the basis of pluralism is mankind’s handful of shared moral presuppositions, and then they insist that as covenant-breakers and covenant-keepers become more consistent over time, these shared areas of moral agreement grow ever more narrow. They are in a moral and theological muddle, and they call it Christian social theory. 88 (The major American publisher of this muddle is William B. Eerdmans Co., but InterVarsity Press and Crossway Books are not far behind. To be respectable in academic Christian circles, you must defend the ethical and theological mud- dle of political pluralism, and this commitment to a hybrid world- view steadily undermines theology proper in all the other areas, just as it did with Roger Williams.

Relativism vs. Covenantalism Our three scholars at last present us what they have been leading up to for 139 pages: political relativism.’0 . . . Calvinists in the English Puritan tradition, who have had dispropor- tionately large influence in America, often stressed, as we have seen, na- tionalistic parts of the Old Testament in assessing our nation. Intimating that America’s relationship to God is similar to that of ancient Israel, they long have held up the ideal of “Christian” politics and a “Christian” nation. If, however, we emphasize more the other side of the American Protes- tant heritage, that which sees the New Testament as the primary guide to political attitudes in this age, all politics is relativized. Christians have civic responsibilities and obligations to promote justice. In modern democracies, where to an extent the people rule, these responsibilities are greater than in the Roman Empire. Yet the New Testament nowhere intimates that the Kingdom is politicaJ or that it can be identified with a nation or with na- tional objectives.gl All politics is relatiuized here is humanist pluralism’s official politi- cal manifesto. The kingdom is not political: here is the escape religion. ‘z But what Christian has ever said that the kingdom is political, mean- ing essential~ or primari~ political? Not anyone who I have ever heard of. (Many humanists, however, surely see their kingdom as primar- ily political.)gs These men know all about the Christian theology of 90.

Their own book demonstrates how concerned the Puritans were regarding religious purity: “, . . early New Englanders had determined that they were God’s chosen people because they had such pure religion.”9G So why does the trio adopt such rhetoric? This rhetoric regarding the king- dom as political is misleading, and I believe deliberately so. All they need to do is appeal to the Bible. Their rhetoric establishes a false dichotomy between biblical law and New Testament ethics. It asserts a false dichotomy between the Old Testament’s civil covenant and New Testament civil covenants. Rhetoric Instead of Scholarship Why do they substitute rhetoric for solid historical analysis re- garding the New England Puritans’ theory of politics? Certainly there are some excellent monographs on the topic, yet their footnotes . do not refer to any of them. At the very least, they should have re- ferred to T. H. Breen’s Character of the Good Ruler. Breen writes: “The Puritans’ concern about the good ruler grew out of their even greater concern about the covenant. They insisted that the Lord had made a compact with the English people at some indeterminable time in the past, granting them peace, prosperity, and Protestantism in ex- change for obedience to scriptural law. The Puritans regarded this agreement as a real and binding contract for which all men could be held responsible. If a nation failed the Lord by allowing evil to flour- ish, He punished the entire population, saints and sinners alike.”97 In other words, because they believed in the historical sanctions of God, the Puritans attempted to obey God in the civil realm by affirming the case laws of the Bible. This was done for the good of the whole society, so as to avoid external negative sanctions. Breen’s standard scholarly study appears neither in the book’s footnotes nor in the bibliography. 94.

I suggest it is because the Puritans were so self-consciously covenantal. Our trio had a hidden theological agenda which was not revealed until the book’s final pages: the denial that there is a valid civil covenant between God and any society in the New Testament era, meaning a covenant by which God visits corporate rebellion with historical sanctions. They must therefore affirm that all civil cove- nants are earth-bound. They have implicitly denied the very exist- ence of a civil covenant. They have adopted Locke’s position that there is merely a civil contract made among men. This is precisely what the Puritan political experiment explicitly denied. (In a sense, so did Rousseau’s version of social contract, for it replaced God with the absolutely sovereign general will, which speaks only through the rulers of the civil government. gs This sovereignty imparts to Rousseau’s civil contract the character of absoluteness which is char- acteristic, not of a biblical covenant, but of a pagan city -state.) The authors’ defense of “New Testament anti-covenantalism” is highly selective. It applies only to the civil covenant. Would they say the same about families? I hope not. About churches? I hope not. So, on what authority have they unilaterally declared the permanent abolition or annulment of civil covenants between God and men? I suggest this answer: on the authority of Immanuel Kant, who was the master at creating false dualisms that push God and His law out of the realm of autonomous man. gg The Rejection of National Covenants The trio had already asked the modern neo-evangelical’s favorite rhetorical question regarding biblical politics: “. . . is it proper ever to look upon the American nation as the special agent of God in the world?” 100 They wait until the end of the book to answer this rhetori- cal question, and their answer, not surprisingly, is in the negative. What they, as self-conscious political pluralists, love to do is to chal- lenge the assertion by Christian Americans that God has (or has had in the past) a special (i. e., covenantal) relation to this nation. Why? Because such an assertion raises the issue of national covenants, which in turn 98. Robert A. Nisbet, Tradition r.tnd Reuo[t, op. cit., ch. 1: “Rousseau and the Political Community.” 99.

They reject the idea of God’s covenant judgments against any nation in the New Testament era. (If this statement is exaggerated, which I do not think it is, then at the very least they assume that we cannot determine whether any event or group of events is part of God’s positive or negative sanctions in history. Dr. Marsden states this em- phatically, as we shall see.) They have adopted this attitude from the anti-Trinitarian pro- fessors who taught them, certified them, and tenured them. Their former professors have a much deeper reason for adopting such a view of God’s sanctions: God’s covenantal judgments in history, if accepted as a fact of history, point directly to God’s final judgment beyond history. Presumably, Nell, Hatch, and Marsden are not worried too much about final judgment. But they are quite ready to remove the civil-judicial aspect of the gospel from serious con- sideration. Our three scholars announce openly regarding their previous academic publications (which, I might add as a trained his- torian, are technically and intellectually way above average): “We have written for our academic peers. . . .”101 They are still writing “for” them – as their agents – in The Search for Christian Amm”ca. They are also writing to them, at least in part. Again, they reject the claim that New England’s civil order was truly Christian. This is a very strange argument, given their asser- tion that only church members were allowed to vote in Puritan New England. 102 (This assertion, by the way, is questionable; town resi- dents were allowed to vote in town elections if they were property holders but not church members, but let us pass over this historical problem.) Would they also try to argue that Iran’s civil order is not Muslim because only Muslims are allowed to vote? I doubt it.

They never ask the question: From whom did the Indians of early colonial America get the land? They also never ask the even more pertinent question: Was the advent of the Euro- pean in North America a righteous historical judgment of God against the Indians? On the contrary, our three authors ridicule the Puritans for having suggested that the Indians were the moral and covenantal equivalent of the Canaanites (p. 33). In fact, if ever a continent of covenant-breakers deserved this attribution, the “native Americans” did. On the estimate of a million Indians in 1492, see William Peterson, Population (2nd ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1969), p. 359: estimates by Kroeber (1939), Rosenblat (1945), and Steward (1949).

What we do know is that on the Eastern seaboard, tiny colonies of white settlers survived Indian attacks, 1610-1650, and grew to some three million by 1750, indicating that there had not been very many Indians. 108.

Its inherent working alliance with secular humanism is sometimes hidden by its members’ unstated commitment to the vague and loosely defined categories of natural law and natural rea- son. Roger Williams defended natural law theory and political plu- ralism as the civil alternative to Puritanism’s commitment to biblical law. 113 What do our modern critics of New England Puritanism offer as an alternative? They are less forthright than Williams. They sim- ply do not reply to the question: “If not biblical law, then what?” Like some insane Dutchman who insists that the dikes of Holland be blown up, but systematically refuses to suggest an alternative for keeping out the North Sea, so are today’s evangelical critics of bibli- cal law. There is this distinction, however: nobody would pay any attention to the nutty Dutchman, except possibly to lock him up for his own (and everyone else’s) safety. We allow the antinomian Chris- tian pluralists to teach our children in tenured and subsidized safety from free market forces, not to mention Church censure. Our trio’s one other bit of supposed evidence of this lack of a truly Christian culture is the lack of widespread church membership, 114 which they dare not emphasize too heavily, since they all know about Edmund S. Morgan’s Visible Sainh, which they wisely do not cite, even in their book’s extensive annotated bibliography. At least one of the trio, George Marsden, began his doctoral studies at Yale Univer- sity under Morgan in the same year that Visible Saints was published, so they know what Morgan discovered. His book shows that the Pur- itans’ extra-biblical requirement for church membership of a special conversion experience was at the heart of the second generation’s refusal to join local churches, and was also the reason why New Eng- land’s second-generation Puritan theologians invented the theology of the halfway covenant.115 Historian Robert Middlekauff com- 112.

The authors have completely, utterly misrepresented the Puritan political experiment as somehow not being truly Christian, when it was probably the most self-conscious experiment in building a com- prehensive Christian civil order in the midst of a wilderness that any group has come close to achieving in history. Why did these profes- sional historians so completely misrepresent Puritanism? The an- swer is clear: they reject, above all, the idea of a biblically mandated civil covenant. Nothing is allowed to stand in the way of their diatribe against the whole idea of a biblical civil covenant. I think that this was the number-one purpose of their book, both from their point of view and the publishers. In rejecting the idea of a biblical civil covenant, they lead their readers into the swamp of relativism. “[T]he idea of a ‘Chrktian nation’ is a very ambiguous concept. . . .“11’ It is not surprising, then, that they appeal here for academic support to one of the modern apostles of relativism, H. Richard Niebuhr — not someone who can be regarded as an unimpeachable source. 1 IS Thomas Jefferson, Prophet ? The authors try to persuade the reader of a second unusual hypo- thesis. Their first hypothesis is that the Puritans, being systematic covenant theologians, could therefore not be “truly” Christian in their worldview, because they believed that the civil covenant under God is still a valid concept. Second, they argue that the Constitution’s Framers, who were at best nominal Christians, invented a pluralist civil covenant which is supposedly the universal standard for a Christian society. Thus, the most self-conscious Christians in history (New England Puritans) were not truly Christians in their political views, while a group of essentially non-Christian pluralist politicians in 1787 devised the only legitimate civil foundation for American Christians to accept, now and forever more, amen. 116.

Let us now look at their arguments regarding the worldview of the “Founding Fathers” (the Framers of the Constitution), which I ac- cept as historically valid, based on my own reading of their works and the debates at Philadelphia in 1787.119 They write: “It is difficult for modern Americans to recapture the religious spirit of the country’s great early leaders — George Washington, Thomas Jeffer- son, Benjamin Franklin, and their colleagues. The difficulty arises because these brilliant leaders, surely the most capable generation of statesmen ever to appear in America, were at once genuinely reli- gious but not specifically Christian. Virtually all these great men had a profound belief in ‘the Supreme Judge of the world’ and in ‘the protection of Divine Providence,’ to use the words of the Declaration of Independence. Yet only a few believed in the orthodox teachings of traditional Christianity — that, for example, Christ’s death atoned for sin, that the Bible was a unique revelation from God, or that the miracles recorded in the Scripture actually happened .“ ~20 They do list a few exceptions –John Witherspoon, Patrick Henry (who “smelled a rat” in Philadelphia and who, opposed the ratification of the Constitution), and John Jay – but the major figures were not Tri- nitarians. This is certainly true of Jefferson, John Adams, Franklin, and Madison. It is probably true of Washington. ~zl All of this should provide a major red flag with respect to the soundness of the Constitutional settlement from a biblical point of view. On the contrary, our trio of historians conclude that the apos- tates were correct and the Puritans were wrong. So correct were the Framers that we must never attempt to change the rules back to a Puritan vision of the civil covenant. We return to the statement with which I began this essay: What of the place of the Bible, then, as a basis for political ailion? Should we not bring the nation and its legislation back to the Bible? Here we have to make a careful distinction. Christians’ own political decisions should be informed by biblical principles. This is an important point not to miss. Nevertheless, when bringing these decisions to bear on civic debate and legislation we must agree to the rules of the civic game, which under the American constitution are pluralistic, That means that no matter how 119.

Or what? I think it is safe to say that The Search for Christian America, if ex- amined critically, turns out to be a second-rate piece of historiography in search of a third-rate thesis: the theology of pluralism as the high- est political goal of the Christian. Such shoddy scholarship from a group of previously competent scholars testifies to a deep and abiding intellectual schizophrenia on their part, as well as a task too difficult for the best available minds. They found it impossible to be true to both Jefferson and the Old Testament in matters civil, so they sided with Jefferson in the name of “true” Christianity. This is the basis of their rejection of what they disparagingly refer to as “the myth of America’s ‘Christian’ origins. ” 123 Frankly, I am not impressed.

No one seriously proclaims “the end of ideology” the way that sociologist Daniel Bell did before Kennedy and Camelot disappeared, to be re- placed by Johnson and Vietnam. 125 But if ideology has not ended, then what is the future of political pluralism?

They insist that “The American political system is very frankly a system of compromises. m 126 It surely was deeply compromised in 1789 with respect to the institution of chattel slavery, and all the political pluralism in the world could not have made that comprom- ise any less morally repugnant. The inherent conflict escalated; it had to. The Civil War was an irrepressible conflict, given the unwill- ingness of the South to honor the New Testament’s annulment of Israel’s jubilee land tenure and its permanent slave system. What this nation needed after 1800 with respect to chattel slavery was not more pluralism but less. It needed a Constitutional settlement that announced at long last a closed door to the religion, ideology, eco- nomics, and civilization of chattel slavery. The world needed to close that open door from the day that Jesus announced His fulfillment of the jubilee year. 127 The American Civil War stands as a visible testimony to the fail- ure of political pluralism. Bullets replaced ballots. The North’s view of Constitutional law triumphed over the South’s, not in political cau- cuses but on battlefields. Why do our authors refer again and again to the evils of American chattel slavery, if they also think that politi- cal pluralism provides anything like permanent peaceful solutions to what are clearly inescapable moral conflicts? Why do they want to avoid getting fundamental moral issues solved politically, and in terms of biblical revelation? I perceive that they are of the opinion that the moral issues raised exclusively or primarily by Christian theology are of far less importance morally and especially judicially than common-ground (i.e., Unitarian-dominated) abolitionism was, and so these Christian issues must be adjudicated in religiously ‘neu- tral” civil courts. This leads to the following outlook: ‘The issue of slavery dealt with by the Dred Scott case was too important an issue to be left to the Supreme Court to decide; Roe u. Wbde, on the other hand, is not equally crucial, so Christians must abide by it.” In Britain, the slave issue was solved by democratic coercion; the slave-owners did not have the votes after 1832. Not so in the U.S. Slaves were kept in chains here for an additional three decades, and 126. The Search, p, 133. 127.

(This is bad news for Richard John Neuhaus’ theory that “Democratic persuasion, not emptiness, is the alternative to coercion. ” 128 For American slaves, the alternative was a form of emptiness for thirty extra years, and then coercion: of their masters. ) This is always the fate of pluralism: someone eventually says, “Oh, no, you won’t,” his opponent says, “Oh, yes, I will,” and the fight begins. At that point, the question always is: What is really worth fighting over? This question cannot be forever deferred politi- cally, with or without the polytheistic religion of political pluralism. At best, pluralism is a political cease-&-e until one side is ready to resume the @ght to the death– which the Bible teaches is humanism’s death. When the fight resumes in earnest, there will be few pluralists to be found on the divisive issue in question. Like those who promote an unspecific, hypothetical, and not-yet-published middle way be- tween abortion and anti-abortion, pluralists will have few constitu- ents once the religious conflict escalates. Like pacifists the day after a shooting war breaks out, pluralists will vanish from the arena of public discourse. What had formerly been perceived as a timeless political philosophy will be at long last recognized for what it in- evitably is: a short-term propaganda campaign for a temporary political cease-fire. While it is certainly legitimate for Christians to call for such a cease-fire from time to time, in order to prepare for the next phase of the battle, it is naive for Christianity’s intellectual leaders to treat this cease-fire as if it were a permanent arrangement, let alone the basis of a universally valid political philosophy. But they do. For the time being. Pluralism and Moral Confusion A generation ago, left-wing sociologist C. Wright Mills wrote an indictment of American pluralism, The Power Elite. Though critics have shown that his analysis was anything but detached, and his data were not always conclusive, his basic argument was correct: there are elites in American life. 129 A permanent elite which main- tains power irrespective of the attempted negative sanctions of those represented by it is the covenant-breaker’s version of covenantal hi- 128, Richard John Neuhaus, The Naked Public Square: Reltgion and Democracy in Ama-ica (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans, 1984), p. 121. 129.

There must be representation in history; the question is: In what way are historical sanctions brought against the representatives? Mills correctly identified the nature of today’s illusion: political pluralism’s philosophy of balanced moral and economic interests. Political life is far more ruthless than this. He also identified the source of this belief eighteenth-century Scottish Enlightenment phi- losophy, which undergirded free market economics and the Framers’ pluralist political philosophy. 130 (Scottish Enlightenment philosophy was a secularized version of Scottish common sense realism, which was the basic philosophy of American Protestant academic theology until at least the end of the nineteenth century, and really until after World War I. Mark Nell is a specialist in this field, 131 and one wonders if he has ever abandoned its overall outlook, Van Til’s demolition of it notwithstanding.) Mills argued forcefully that this view of American political insti- tutions is mythical, that power is not parcelled out in the way that the pluralists say it is. Ultimately, Mills insisted, the political struggle is in fact a conzict over moral values. The failure of Americans to under- stand this, he said, is the heart of the modern political crisis: The moral uneasiness of our time results from the fact that older values and codes of uprightness no longer grip the men and women of the corpor- ate era, nor have they been replaced by new values and codes which would lend moral meaning and sanction to the corporate routines they must fol- low. It is not that the mass public has explicitly rejected received codes; it is rather that to many of the members these codes have become hollow. No moral terms of acceptance are available, but neither are any moral terms of rejection. As individuals, they are morally defenseless; as groups, they are politically indifferent. It is this generalized lack of commitment that is meant when it is said that ‘the public’ is morally confused. 132 Such moral confusion regarding public issues is the inevitable product of a philosophy which teaches that irreconcilable moral con- flicts are not inherently religious, and therefore perhaps not inher- ently irreconcilable. In such a pluralist political order, there must be no public political appeal to ultimate, God-given moral standards. 130. Ibid., p. 242. 131. Mark A.

That means that no matter how strongly the Bible or other revelation in- forms our political views, for the purposes of civic debate and legislation we will not appeal simply to religious authority.” 133 This is the widely held view of most voters today. Why, then, should we be surprised to discover that Christians in the electorate do not know where to turn for righteous solutions to the problems of the day? Their scholarly leaders to whom they have entrusted the training of their children have told them Christians have a moral and political obligation to shut their Bibles when they enter the pub- lic arena. Today’s Christian voters have faith in no authoritative judicial standards by which moral and political order can be restored in the midst of the real and now widely perceived moral dissolution of our era. Thus, political solutions to crises come only when some secular humanist moral scene is coercive~ imposed by a power elite to solve the problem. There is only one politically acceptable alternative to this process: moral conflicts are deferred for a season by political or bureaucratic tinkering, plus an additional infusion of government money. Tutic or Permanent Philosophy? Once we understand that political pluralism is a process of public moral deception and~”udicial deferral, the only reasonable defense of this philosophy becomes pure pragmatism: to reduce visible con~icts tempor- ari~. One can of course attempt to defend pluralism as a permanent philosophy by arguing that Christianity in politics tends to promote violent conflict, so let us choose pluralism for the sake of social peace. This is exactly what the authors argue. “In political life, if every party is certain its position is backed by the sure authority of God, the likelihood of violence increases vastly.” 134 They are obvi- ously worried about the terrors of ideological politics, a fear shared by other liberal historians. ’35 So, they conclude, let us choose in- stead pluralism.

He admits that “The view that the colonies were significantly Christian has a good bit to recommend it.

Each was a remarkable attempt to establish a holy commonwealth.” 1 38 (Yes, reader, this is the very same man who co-authored The Search. ) But other colonies, he says, were “more nominally Christian .“ 136.

Then he cited Remans 13:1-5 on the magistrate as God’s minister of terror to evil. 147 The Charter prohibited any molesting of “all persons living in this province who confess and acknowledge the one almighty and eternal God to be the creator, upholder, and ruler of the world. . . . “14s They were not to be com- pelled to attend church or pay compulsory tithes. But Penn made it clear in his 1701 update of the charter that such theological latitude was only for common citizens. Civil magistrates were under Trinitarian theocratic restrictions. To serve as a civil magistrate, a person had to “also profess to believe in Jesus Christ, the saviour of the world. . . . ~ 1 w Magistrates had to take this oath: And I, A. B., profess faith in God the Father and in Jesus Christ his eternal son, the true God, and in the Holy Spirit, one God blessed for ever- more; and do acknowledge the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testa- ment to be given by divine inspiration. 150 And finally, in good Quaker fashion, every member of the Assembly had to pay the clerk of the Assembly five pence to record this decla- ration in the official roll book.

In 1868-69, Penn had spent eight months imprisoned in the Tower of Lon- don during the Privy Council’s extended “investigation” of his theological views. The Privy Council could not convict anyone; it could, however, permanently imprison someone during its investigation. Penn, only one year a Quaker, had written Sandy Foun&ztions Shaken in 1668, an attack on the Trinity, He was persuaded to retract his views by the King’s chaplain, Edward Stillingfleet. Penn later admitted only Sabellian views: the three Persons of the Trinity as aspects of God. But he affirmed the divinity of Jesus. Leonard W.

A large majority of the inhabitants were nonconforming Protestants, although the Anglican Church was the established church, and its pastors were supported by compulsory taxes. There were only two Anglican churches in South Carolina — the major Carolina colony — as late as 1700.151 The authority to grant such a special dispensation was given to the original founders and their heirs. Such a grant of toleration was tightly restricted: the exempted citizen had to declare repeated loyalty to the King and his heirs, “and be subject and obedient to all the other laws, ordinances, constitu- tions of the said province, in all matters whatsoever, as well ecclesi- astical as civil, and do not in any wise disturb the peace and safety thereof, or scandalize or reproach the said liturgy, forms and cere- monies, or anything relating thereunto, or any person or persons whatsoever, for or in respect of his or their use or exercise thereof, or his or their obedience and conformity, thereunto.” 152 The 1669/70 “Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina,” written by John Locke, 153 was an attempt by one proprietor, Lord Ashley, to liberalize and for- malize the earlier charter. He never succeeded in imposing it legally on the colony, although it did become a judicial model. 154 In this document, we discover: “No man shall be permitted to be a freeman of Carolina or to have any estate or habitation within it that does not acknowledge a god; and that god is publicly and solemnly wor- shipped .’’~55 In the English colonies of North America in 1670, that meant Christianity.

The “Nominal~ Christian” Colonies New York did not impose oaths on its magistrates, but it did have a state church, Anglicanism, up until the Constitution of 1777. But it was careful about immigrants. An Act for Naturalizing All Those of Foreign Nations was passed in 1683. The problem, began the Act, was that “Forasmuch as several persons of diverse foreign nations professing Christianity now and for diverse years past” have settled in the colony. So, the Governor, Council, and representatives declared that such residents, “professing Christianity,” could become citizens by taking an oath of allegiance to the state government. ’63 Georgia, the southernmost colony, was established as a trusteeship in 1733. It seems to have had no Trinitarian standards for voting or office-holding, as far as I can determine from the records in my library. Not many colonists lived in Georgia, however. James Oglethorpe’s 1733 ‘Account of the Designs of the Tiwstees” did say that “Christianity will be extended by the execution of this design. . . .”164 The fact that Oglethorpe, the founder of the colony, was a FreemasoniG5 may have had something to do with the absence of colony-wide Trinitarian standards. If I had a readily available set of J. N. Thorpe’s Federal and State Comtitutiom, and if I had more time, I could continue this game of ‘find the document.” I think this is unnecessary. The point is, Marsden’s evidence for his rejection of Christian colonial America is remark- ably weak. (I have not referred to the New England charters, to Maryland’s, and to Delaware’s, which I cover in Part 3.) The aver- age reader would never guess from reading The Search that one of the major issues leading to the American Revolution was the question of whether the Church of England should send a bishop to the colonies, rather than leaving the Bishop of London as the presiding bishop. 166 This issue would hardly promote a political revolution today. 162.

Instead, he points to Thomas Morton (1620’s) as a more representative colonial American. This is an outrageous assertion, the product of Marsden’s ideology rather than any detailed research on his part (or anyone else’s). You probably have never heard of Thomas Morton. He is known only to specialists in colonial history. That Dr. Marsden refers to him in a brief essay in a one-volume general encyclopedia is simply astounding. What is even more astounding is that he thinks Morton is representative of colonial life. In the first decade of New England, Morton immigrated, set up a little community outside the normal jurisdiction of Plymouth colony, sold guns to the Indians, denounced Christianity, and erected (the correct verb) a maypole. 167 This prac- tice had been condemned as a survival of paganism by Puritan Philip Stubbes half a century earlier. 168 Miles Standish was immedi- ately sent by the authorities at Plymouth to arrest Morton, which he did, and the authorities deported Morton back to England. 169 His- torian Charles M. Andrews described him thusly: “Morton was a, bohemian, a humorist, a scoffer, and a libertine, with no moral stan- dards of thought or conduct. ~ 1 TO Morton later returned to Massachu- setts, where he remained in intermittent conflict with the authorities. Marsden neglects to mention any of this, and then concludes: “In the colonies as a whole, the Thomas Mortons probably were always more numerous than the strict Calvinists. They are just as legiti- mately part of the American heritage.” 171 Interesting. Yet it raises this question: Which historical records indicate that those holding to Mr. Morton’s theology, let alone im- itators of his maypole activities, were more widespread in the col- onies than Christians or even “strict Puritans ,“ from 1624 until, say, 167. Dancing around a maypole, a phallic symbol, is commonly practiced in May. Wherever this custom is found,” writes Eliade, “the ‘Maypole’ gives an occa- sion for general jollity ending with a dance round the pole. The chief part is usually played by young people or children.

But this dearth of documentary evidence is neither here nor there for Dr. Marsden. He resorts in- stead to rhetoric, which is a safe tactic only. if one’s intended au- dience is utterly ignorant of even the most cursory facts of one’s own academic discipline. This is grossly unfair to the victimized reader, who thinks he is reading a history book rather than a political tract. We can honestly trace the history of American pluralism “From Morton to Marsden.” That Dr. Marsden would select Thomas Mor- ton, a highly unrepresentative figure in colonial American history, as “probably” more representative of most colonists than the “strict” Puritans, is clear testimony to Dr. Marsden’s personal war against any civil manifestation of Christian civilization. Morton was a de- viant both sexually and religiously, and those few humanistic text- book writers who have bothered to mention this otherwise peripheral figure have done so only because he was the representative example of what New England was not. But not Dr. Marsden; he singles out Morton as a representative of what most colonists “probably” were in their anti-prayer closets. To present Thomas Morton as a more representative figure than the “strict” Puritans in American colonial history is the equivalent of selecting Benedict Arnold as a representative figure in colonial mili- tary history, or Aaron Burr as a representative American political figure. It would make as much sense to select Shimei as a representa- tive political figure in Davidic Israel (II Sam. 16:5-14; I Ki. 2:8-10, 36-46). In fact, Dr. Marsden can be accurately described as the dean of the Shimei school of historiography. What Marsden’s statement regarding Morton indicates is that he, in his academic life, has reverted back to something reminiscent of the secular humanist worldview of Vernon L. Barrington and the Progressive historians, but without doing any new primary source research. It was they who regarded New England’s theocratic experi- ment as an aberration. Having moved to post-Civil War American religious history as his preferred specialty, Marsden briefly returned to colonial religious history in 1983 as if Perry Miller and Edmund Morgan had never appeared on the academic scene. It was Miller who understood the Puritan doctrine of the covenant as foundational to the development of American political theory, with the doctrine of natural rights a secularized derivative; 172 it was Barrington who 172.

This is the man who began his first book in 1970 – a reworked doctoral dissertation – with these words: “For many years American historiography was marked by a quiet prejudice against evangelical Protestantism in nineteenth-century American life. Historians during the early twentieth century, in the midst of their own emancipation from Protestant intellectual and moral dogmatism, emphasized the tolerant and the progressive in America’s national tradition. Evangelicalism, which in the opening decades of this century was usually masked in the robes of militant fundamentalism, appeared retrograde and obscurantist.

All three of them were apparently struck by collective amnesia around 1979. Not one of them remembers his own past writings or the writings of his two colleagues, an intellectual affliction which I have designated as OTwellus bibliographus.

Even before the Revolution, the assumption that God favored the English nation and its American colonies was wide- spread, but this conviction was reforged with new intensity in the violent crucible of events that saw the United States break its ties with the mother country. The growing belief that Europe had entered a period of decadence led to a corresponding conviction that God’s children were concentrated particularly in America. When the events of the Revolution seemed to bear out this assumption, when it became clear, in Moses Mather’s words, “that it is God that fighteth for us,” belief in America’s speciaJ place in God’s esteem took even firmer hold on the masses of Christian Americans. Against all odds, God had prospered the valiant efforts of his colonial chil- dren as they struggled to throw off the immoral tyranny of their despotic masters. The elaborate system of covenantal thought which had undergirded earlier expressions concerning God’s care for the colonies was largely aban- doned during the second half of the eighteenth century, but the essential dogma of the covenantal system – that the colonies stood in a special rela- tionship to God — survived as an article of faith throughout the denomina- tional spectrum. By 1800 the assertion that God dealt with the United States in a unique way was a commonplace. 177 I need to remind the reader that it is this covenantal and provi- dential idea of America that Nell, Hatch, and Marsden take such pains to deny in their book, as do their neo-evangelical colleagues in the Wheaton-Calvin-Gordon College alliance. So, we need to note the difference between their view of America and the views of the colonial period. We need to note it in order to prepare ourselves for the bait-and-switch procedure of our trio: their reading of modern views of political pluralism back into the widely held political phi- losophy of eighteenth-century America. The American Revolution was a product of a particular eschatol- ogy: postmillennialism. Our three authors reject such a view of his- 176.

There is no doubt that they also understand its impact in American history. 178 Nell writes: Millennial overtones have also persisted in the course of America’s his- tory, due at least in part to the thorough millennialism that marked such a large part of the re~gious reaction to-the Revolution. The way in which America’s ideals of freedom and justice have been championed in public discourse has encouraged the idea that perfect freedom and perfect justice might be obtainable through the concentrated efforts of those upon whom God has already bestowed a foretaste of these blessings. During the Revolu- tion, Christians felt that a successful completion of the war might be the prelude to the visible appearance of the Kingdom of God on earth. In later American history the millennial vision lost its sharp theological definition, but nevertheless lived on. 179 The literature on the postmillennial vision in American history was voluminous when Nell wrote this, and it has grown larger sub- sequently. lsO Nell correctly argues that the Revolution was a product of both English libertarian or Whig thought and Christian orthodoxy. 181 There is no question that this Whig political tradition was not inher- ently Trinitarian, although Trinitarians (especially the nonconformist sects) had adopted it. 182 Any attempt to downplay this fact has led and will continue to lead to inaccurate historiography. But there is also equally little doubt that among the broad masses of the colo- nists, on both sides of the Revolutionary struggle, most people were Christians, not secret Socinian (proto-Unitarian) Whigs. ’ 83 Virtually 178.

Thus, we read in the book co-edited by Nell, Hatch, Marsden, David Wells, and John Woodbridge that “It is occasionally said that the United States was founded on ‘Christian principles.’ While that is not true in any specific political sense, it is true that certain themes from the Puritan past contributed to Revolutionary thought.

Nell is forced to admit what should be obvious to any historian of the Revolutionary era: the beliefs of the common people who fought the war were not the same as the political tracts written by the lead- ers, especially when those tracts were aimed at each other. Nell knows this. “The first three elected Presidents of the United States – Washington, Adams, and Jefferson – all advocated a form of reason- able religion that drained the supernatural from religion and valued piety primarily for its civic utility. Although this form of enlightened religion never came to command the allegiance of most common people, it did enjoy great popularity among educated Americans and was quite the intellectual rage among college students in the last two decades of the eighteenth century. ~~gl An intellectual fad among a tiny handful of college-educated people was not the religion which produced the American Revolution, let alone the Great Awakening that preceded it. Nell correctly observes that “By 1776 America was well on the way to becoming a pluralistic Protestant country.” 192 Notice that the nation was not pluralistic, meaning a system in which every religion was equal; it was unquestionably Protestant, and within this broad Trinitarian category, there were many opinions. But this is not good enough to salvage our trio’s thesis: that they just cannot seem to find evidence of a Christian America. Protestant pluralism is a far cry — indeed, a Civil War battle cry — away from the political pluralism promoted by our trio in The Search of Christian America. Nell fully understands this. He admits that “Religious points of view which strayed from that nationalistic center would have to wait until the twentieth century to be recognized as significant factors in the cul- ture of American religion. ~~ lW, This highly damaging admission aP- peared in 1983, the same year that The Search was published. Nell is a historian with a very short memory. He cannot seem to remember what he has written in the manuscript on the other side of his desk. During the early 1980’s, Nell and his two colleagues began to re- write American colonial history in terms of their preference for some modern version of eighteenth-century Real Whiggery. To use Nell’s phrase, they (like most of their academic peers) had adopted h-eli- 191. Ibid., pp. 164-65. 192. Ibid., p. 147. 193.

What event or events persuaded them that there had been a shift in the thinking of American Christians away from pietism toward judicial covenantalism and away from passive eschatologies toward postmillennialism?) They have been stymied in this self-appointed task so far only by their inability to locate a previ- ously ignored cache of eighteenth-century baptismal records pres- enting formulas along these lines: “I baptize this child in the name of James Barrington, John Trenchard, and Adam Smith.” But their search for a Whig America nonetheless continues. Why, then, such strong objections in 1983 to the idea of the Christian origins of America? 195 Where is the evidence that America was anything but a Christian nation at its founding? Perhaps the anti-oath clause of the U.S. Constitution (Article VI, Clause 111). 196 But this piece of evidence points to a very controversial possibility, one which neither our trio nor the defenders of the Christian history of the Constitution wish to discuss seriously: that the Constitution was the product of a coup d’elat by the Socinian Virginia dynasty and their allies from other colonies. This is too conspiratorial a thesis for our trio to accept, and too unpatriotic for their opponents to accept. 197 Nell’s comment in a 1988 book describes their dilemma: they must explain how the Constitution was less influenced by Christian preaching yet far better for Christianity. Nell’s words are significant. He admits that his conclusions appear paradoxical. “Such a conclu- sion brings us back to the apparent paradox. When Christian in- volvement was intense — during the Revolution — Christianity suf- fered. When Christian involvement was much less intense – during the writing of the Constitution — the results were far better for the 194. See Part 3 195.

Hatch Nathan Hatch made his academic reputation with his first book, The Sacred Cause of Liber~ (1977). This was fortunate for him, since it remains his only book. 199 There is still the lingering scent of doctoral dissertation about the book, but it is nonetheless an excellent study. It is subtitled, Republican Thought and the Millennium in Revolutionary New England. It argues, not surprisingly, that the theological topic of eschatology was important in the pre-Revolutionary colonial era. This raises an obvious question. If America was never a Christian nation, then why in the name of autonomous man did questions of biblical eschatology have any impact whatsoever-on pre-Revolutionary New England? And why on earth did Hatch begin his book with a quotation from Levi Hart (1775)? Hart wrote: Indeed, the sacred cause of liberty bath been, and ever will be venerable in every part of the world where knowledge, and learning flourish, and men suffered to think and speak for themselves. Yea, it must be added, that Heaven bath appeared in the cause of liberty, and that in the most open and decisive manner: For this, the Son of God was manifest in the flesh, that he might destroy the tyranny of sin and satan, assert and maintain the equal government of his Father, redeem the guilty slaves from their more than Egyptian bondage, and cause the oppressed to go free.

You get the point. In 1979, a book by Hatch, Nell, and a third pluralist historian, John D. Woodbridge, was published by Zondervan, The Gospel in America. In this book, we learn that “The watershed of the American sense of mission and destiny can be traced to Puritan England. Re- cent studies have emphasized the intense sense of religious patriotism that dominated seventeenth-century England – and par- ticularly those of Puritan persuasion. . . . The Puritans who came to establish New England were even more intense in their conviction that God had chosen them. The theme that crossing the Atlantic was the Exodus for God’s ‘New English Israel’ runs throughout the early sermons of Massachusetts .“201 They also say that “During the colonial period the strongest attack on the idea that America was a city on a hill came from the lips of Roger Williams, founder of Rhode Island and spiritual father of American Baptists .”ZOZ Do they then go on to demonstrate that Williams’ opinion became dominant during the eighteenth century? On the contrary: In the years prior to American independence, the dissenting voice of Roger Williams gave way to an ever stronger chorus that America was unique — and providentially so. In New England ministers continued to ap- ply to their own colonies Old Testament texts addressed to Israel; they began also to address the Puritan founders by such names as Moses, Aaron, and Joshua. If other Americans considered Yankees a bit provincial because of this, they were soon relieved to find that in the aftermath of the Great Awakening (a revival ignited throughout the colonies) that Jonathan Edwards announced that not just New England but all of America would be the center of Christ’s millennial kingdom. And as the Americans took up arms against the French in the Seven Years’ War (1756-1763), many agreed with the evangelical Presbyterian Samuel Davies from Virginia that de- feating Catholic France would wound Antichrist sufficiently to bring on that long-awaited reign. Z03 There was one important shift in perspective, however: the reason offered for this millennial triumph. It was America’s civil liberty which was the basis of God’s favor. Z04 201. John D.

Their answer was that God, in their view, had shifted his primary base of operations to the arena of nations. In the ringing success of the American republic, they witnessed a model for the coming age: . . . “206 How’s that again? The ministers in the late eighteenth century believed that God was dealing with nations as His base of operations. He was dealing with the United States in this way. They therefore still rejected Roger Williams’ view of a pluralistic, non-covenantal nation. Then how, in the name of covenant sanctions, can it be that America was never – our trio’s 1983 thesis – a Christian nation? Given the thesis of The Search for Christian America, consider also this statement: “Evangelical have not always been a beleaguered minority in American society. In fact, their attempt to Christianize American society in the nineteenth century is a remarkable success story.” In the entire period, only the Revolutionary era was a period of “declining fortunes,” and it was reversed by 1800, they say, so much so that “historians are led to describe that period of American history as an ‘Evangelical Empire.’ “ 207 The safest way to deny the evidence of Christian America is to ignore the evidence.

The authors praised Bernard Ramm’s 1954 book promoting a non-literal interpretation of Genesis 1-10, Th Chrirtian View of Scieme and Scn@m (p. 86), but they did not mention Henry Morris’ Genesis Flood (1961). That Ramm drifted out of orthodoxy and toward Barthianism in the 1970’s is not surprising, given his anti-creationist views of 1954. He simply followed the logic of his presuppositions. Ramm may have impressed a handful of neo-evangelicals in the 1950’s, but his influence outside of the Wheaton College classroom was minimal.

They will not check the footnotes; thus, they can be easily fooled. Mar.rden George Marsden’s first major academic publication was his 1970 Church Histoy review article on Harvard historian (actually, an Eng- lish professor) Perry Miller. Miller had been the acknowledged mas- ter of the worldview of American Puritanism. What Marsden dem- onstrated in what has become a widely cited historiographical essay is that Miller had been remarkably ignorant of the voluminous writ- ings of John Calvin, especially C alvin’s commentaries on the Bible, yet the Puritans were self-consciously the heirs of Calvin. Not fully understanding Calvin’s covenant theology, Miller mistakenly em- phasized differences between the Puritans and Calvin – differences that really did not exist. 208 Miller was also ignorant of the Bible, and so he did not see the biblical basis of many of the Puritans’ beliefs. He paid insufficient attention to their creeds. Marsden then made a telling observation: “The lack of emphasis on the place of Scripture and doctrine suggests that Miller realized that the Puritans could not be rehabilitated in the mid-twentieth century unless they were dis- sociated as far as possible from their exclusively Christian emphases. >~209 Miller ignored & person and work of Christ in their system of theology and philosophy. “At least, one hardly comes away from any of Miller’s accounts with the feeling that Christ was even theoretically central in the Puritan system. Yet Miller makes no apologies for this omission .”zlo To which I add: neither does Marsden in his post-1980 treatments OJ Christian colonial America! Miller, however, may simply have been ig- norant of the Bible; Marsden, the son of a minister and a graduate of Calvinistic Westminster Theological Seminary, is not equally ignor- ant of Scripture. He stands condemned by his own words: 208. I had hoped to write a similar essay, but Marsden beat me to it. I probably would not have gotten around to it anyway; it obviously took a lot of work. 209.

This process is not by any means a fully developed thesis, but it is an undeniable subtle tendency.211 In Marsden’s case, this de-Christianizing of colonial American his- tory is a fully developed thesis, and there is nothing subtle about it. He accused Miller of de-emphasizing basic religious doctrines that the Puritans held dear. “When he interprets Puritan thought for his contemporary audience, concepts which the Puritans themselves considered most essential are lost among the riches of the comments of the twentieth century observer.”zlz When Marsden interprets colonial American thought for his contemporary Christian audience, he does the same thing. But there is this difference: Miller was writ- ing for covenant-breakers, and chose not to assault their theological sensitivities by emphasizing the Christocentric worldview of the Puritans; Marsden, in contrast, co-authored this book for use by covenant-keepers who might have a soft spot in their hearts for the idea of a Christian society, an idea which utterly repels Marsden. For Miller’s peers, theocracy was an antiquarian relic; for Marsden’s intended audience — though not his academic peers — theocracy is an idea which might be worth considering. Marsden is far more willing to discuss the Christian roots of America with his de-sensitized academic peers than with the Christians who might conceivably read The Search. Here is how he ended his critique of Miller: “The quality of Miller’s rehabilitation of the Puritan image should not be taken lightly either. His work was a revision, and like all revisions errs somewhat in the other extreme. Certainly Miller played fewer his- torical tricks on the Puritans than did his American predecessors. His contribution to both understanding and appreciating Puritan- ism is invaluable. He does, however, restore the Puritan image at the expense of important aspects of Puritan theology and religion. When we remember, as Miller has demonstrated, that the Puritans were tough-minded men of the Renaissance, let us recall also that they were uncompromising Christians and (in the twentieth century view) bigoted Calvinists. As for the thesis that the covenant of grace represented a revision of Calvinism, Miller has created a myth that 211. Idem. 212.

New England had “some serious short- comings ,“ he says. “Paradoxically” – paradoxically for the pluralist historian – ‘perhaps the most serious were related to the very idea under discussion — that they thought of themselves as an [sic] uniquely Christian society. The Puritans supposed that they stood in the same relation to God as had Old Testament Israel. They thought that God had chosen them to play a special role in the history of the New World, to be a new Israel. They even put some of the Old Tes- tament legislation into their law books.’’214 Here is the heart of the matter for the pluralist: Old Testament law, meaning Old Tatament capital sanctions. The Puritans of Massachusetts put a dozen of them into their constitution, the Body of Liberties, in 1641, even citing the Old Testament Scripture passages. 215 This is what the pluralists can- not accept: the idea that God holds modern men and modern soci- eties responsible to Him covenantally, which means they are under His Bible-revealed covenant sanctions in history. On this point, modern fundamentalists, modern “Calvinistic” pluralists, and mod- ern secular humanists agree completely. Marsden speaks representa- tively for the whole era in which we live. God, have mercy on us, miserable offenders. Yet by 1983, Marsden had begun to play his own tricks, not sim- ply on the Puritans, but on those contemporary Christians who might take seriously the civilization which they built on the founda- tion of Old Testament civil law. In the final analysis, who has been more faithful to the Puritans as Christians, Marsden or Miller? Miller stressed their view of the covenant and its relation to every- thing they did, including politics and law-making. Marsden stresses their Calvinism and rejects as non-Christian their law-making. I think the answer is clear who has been the truer witness: Miller the pagan, not Marsden the seminary graduate. 213.

Political conservatives make him very nervous, for good reason, and the Puritans were surely conservatives. He fears a revival of Puritanism, also for good reason. Their very presence in American history stands as a testimony against the liberal mess of pottage — or pot of message — that our trio of historians thought more worthy than their theological birthright as Christians. Should we be surprised to learn that George Marsden in 1981 vol- unteered to testify against the creationists in the landmark Arkansas school case, McLean u. Arkansas? The Arkansas legislature had passed a “balanced treatment” law requiring the.presentation of a stripped- down version of six-day creationism – neither the Bible nor God was to be mentioned in class 216 – whenever evolutionism was presented in a public school classroom or textbook. When the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) went to court to protest this law, Dr. Marsden journeyed to Arkansas to testify on behalf of the ACLU- led forces. Explaining the zeal of the creationist forces, Marsden compared them to nineteenth-century fundamentalists. “Literal defense of the Bible,” he was quoted as saying, “is the first defense against modern thought. w 1 T Clearly, no one could fairly accuse George Marsden of being a nineteenth-century fundamentalist! 218 (Predictably, the creationists lost the case.) The Election of Ronald Reagan I suggest that the cause of our trio’s collective amnesia regarding so much of what they had written prior to 1980 was the election in 1980 of Ronald Reagan as President of the United States. This was done with the vociferous support of a clear majority of the funda- mentalist and evangelical community. The almost universal political passivism and neutralism of American fundamentalism, which Marsden had chronicled in 1980, 219 disappeared almost overnight. 216. This is the compromised creationism promoted by John N. Moore in his book, How to Teach Origins (Without ACLU Inte@rence) (Milford, Michigan: Mott Media, 1983). This view assumes that the public school system is morally and bibli- cally legitimate, and that you can discuss creationism in such schools without any re- ference to the Bible or the Creator.

The language of “reforming America according to Christian princi- ples” was spreading rapidly in the early 1980’s, and our trio sensed the liberalism-threatening nature of this shift. zz” And let there be no doubt about it: our trio is politically liberal. For almost three generations, the Social Gospel liberals had chal- lenged fundamentalists to “put their Christianity into action,” which to the Social Gospel liberal meant voting for legislation proposed by Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt. When the fundamen- talists at last began showing signs of getting politically involved, they voted for Reagan. The liberals were appalled. They challenged this as a misguided baptizing of “secular conservative politics” with the gospel. It was clearly a misuse of religion. “There are no biblical blueprints,” they shouted. They started counting votes — the liberal’s version of holy communion — and the votes for Reagan were far greater than the votes for Carter. “No more talk about a uniquely Christian politics,” they proclaimed. “This sounds like theocracy to us, and you know what we think of theocracy!” (In their lexicon, theocracy is defined as an immoral, tyrannical political system in which Christian conservatives get elected. ) What was therefore needed was a book aimed at the intelligent Christian community proving that there are neither historical nor judicial grounds for re- garding the United States as a Christian nation.

Why did three professional historians who on other occasions have produced excellent academic work fail so miserably in this book? Because in this book they at last put their presuppositional cards on the table for all to see: both their academic peers and their victims, namely, his- torically ignorant Christian readers. The trio wanted to prove to their colleagues – especially their neo-evangelical, Ph. D-holding col- leagues – that they are still inside the camp of the humanist-certified academic guild. They had not broken covenant with academic Egypt. To prove this, they were forced to betray the unskilled reader, who naively thinks that this book is a work of Christian historiography rather than an exercise in disinformation. The layman does not real- ize what is going on, or whose interests are being faithfully served. He becomes the sacrificial lamb on the altar of academic respectabil- ity. He is being asked to give up his search for Christian America in the documents of the past, so that he will not gain a vision of re-establz’shing Christian civilization in the present. The authors well understand the threat facing Canaanites throughout history: covenant-keepers who dwell longingly on the promises given to Abraham may begin to think seriously about the possibility of conquering Canaan. This dis- turbs the Canaanites, as well as their officially certified representa- tives within the covenant community. The Search for Christian America is the product of an attitude of hat- red. These men hate God’s Old Testament law. They have built their shared worldview on the denial of the visible sanctions of God’s cove- nant law in history, for if God’s sanctions appear in history, then Christians are responsible for obeying him. They are responsible for re-conquering Canaan. w?zol~ Revealed by Being Whol~ Hidden Like all political pluralists, Nell, Hatch, and Marsden begin their analysis with a presupposition: men cannot look at the events of history and perceive the actions of God. Why not? Because the events of history are silent with respect to God’s promised covenant sanctions. Marsden made this quite clear in an earlier essay: “Bibli- cal history records not only that God acts, but often tells us explicitly how and why God acts. Non-biblical historical records lack these lat- ter qualities. At best we know only the most general principles of how God is working in historical developments.

Finally, as Professor Charles J. Miller has pointed out, any attempt to apply the patterns of Old Testament history to the era since the coming of Christ confuses the character of the two eras. In the Old Testament, God’s care for his people involved direct material bless- ings as well as spiritual blessings. The New Testament age, on the other hand, is the age of the Spirit, when Christians are not told that they should expect to prosper in this world, but rather that they should expect to be the poor and suffering. ”zzz What a moving and humble sentiment, especially from any tenured college professor pulling down $45,000 or more for teaching nine hours a week (and maybe even twelve), eight months a year! Conclusion: “We therefore cannot presume to correlate the judgments of God with a nation’s apparent good deeds or bad deeds.”zzs This may be called Christian scholarship, but it is pluralism, pure and simple. It is an applied version of Meredith Kline’s theol- ogy of an inscrutable God — a theology which allows Christians to make up their philosophy and their ethical rules as they go through life: “And meanwhile it [the common grace order] must run its course within the uncertainties of the mutually conditioning princi- ples of common grace and common curse, prosperity and adversity being experienced in a manner largely unpredictable because of the inscrutable sovereignty of the divine will that dispenses them in mysterious ways.’’ 224 There is a syllogism which secretly undergirds this view of his- tory. It is this: No covenant sanctions in New Covenant history, so no covenant law in New Covenant history; no covenant law in New Covenant history, so no covenant responsibility in New Covenant history. In short, Christians may vote either liberal or conservative, Democratic or Republican, but they must not vote biblical. Most important, they must not seek to infiltrate and then capture all polit- ical organizations in the name of a covenant God who has estab- lished His judicially binding blueprints in His Bible-revealed law. 222.

Is the Ballot Box Real~ Sovereign? Pluralism presents itself publicly as a political philosophy of strictly formal procedures. It carefully distinguishes these formal procedures from any particular moral or substantive goal (i. e., eth- ics). Its philosophical defense is based on the logic of a certain form of eighteenth-century, Anglo-Saxon, liberal Enlightenment human- ism: the liberty of the autonomous individual citizen. This defense has usually been connected with arguments relating to the freedom of conscience. Pluralism is officially supposed to avoid being drawn into debates over the ethical content of legislation. Ethically speak- ing, as far as the official philosophy of pluralism is concerned, any- thing goes, just so long as the State’s formal procedural requirements are adhered to. I offer as evidence “abortion on demand” in the U. S., a law which was declared retroactively by the U.S. Supreme Court, not by any state or federal legislature. “The Supreme Court has ruled,” we are told by smirking, sanctimonious defenders of conven- ient mass murder. “But abortion is immoral!” Christians reply. Reply: “Nevertheless, the Court has ruled. It’s the law.” To which the per- ceptive Christian may choose to answer: “Then let’s test the law . . . if necessary, 20,000 times a year in the courts .“ And if the outraged pluralist replies, “That’s not playing fair; that would destroy the court system,” the Christian may choose to remain silent, a Consti- tutional guarantee. The problem of pluralism is far deeper than just its vulnerability to principled court-jamming. Who or what is to say that a formal ju- dicial structure is ethically (substantively) sacrosanct? Who or what 225. Marsden, ‘Teaching of History; op. cit., p. 40."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"HalJway Covenant Historiography 293 is to say that people who adhere to its requirements precisely cannot subsequently change (i. e., amend) these requirements? Who is to say that the voters may not vote in a system that forbids further amend- ments? Who is to say that the suicide of pluralism is illegal? To deny that such a procedurally correct abandonment of pluralism is fully legitimate in terms of the rules of the political game, defenders of a pluralistic political order can do so successfully only by an appeal to some supposedly higher sovereignty that has declared pluralism’s ju- dicial formalism as mankind’s highest ethical goal. The procedural sovereignty of the pluralist political order must then be defended by an appeal to a higher sovereignty. What I am saying is that the god of pluralism is not in fact the god who reveals himself solely through the secret ballot; it is the god who reveals himself all too publicly in the humanist-accredited classrooms of America’s colleges and universities. Pluralism is said to be the law of the land. To which I reply: “For now, my friend, for now. This need not be a permanent condition .“ To which the pluralist implicitly replies: “I will appeal my case to a higher power.” Intellectual Schizophrenia This appeal to a “higher power,” I contend, is implicitly what pro- fessors Nell, Hatch, and Marsden have done. They do not tell us what this higher sovereignty is. They imply that it must be the God of the Bible, yet the language of their presentation indicates that their unnamed proposed sovereignty is that well-known amorphous divinity, the People of 1788. In any case, they have been either ex- ceedingly clever in concealing this hidden Sovereign from their readers or else they are themselves unaware of what their concealed presupposition really is: the absolute sovereign of late-eighteenth-centu~, Anglo-Saxon, Enlightenment judicial formalism. 226 In short, they appeal 226. Writes Forrest McDonald: “Inside the Anglo-Saxon scheme of things, the sum total of governmental power that was regarded as legitimate was vi%ally boundless, being subject to only two limitations. One was the contract, public or private. The other was tradition, largely as embodied in the common law, which was in essence a set of personal rights in the form of procedures that governed the exer- cise of power. Together they placed life, liberty, and property morally beyond the caprice of kings, lords, and majorities. But these two theoretically unbreakable limitations were the only restrictions on otherwise unlimited power?

The political problem which we face today is this: most Chris- tians in the pews and voting booths do not yet understand that any pluralism-induced lull in the political war between God’s kingdom and Satan’s is merely a temporary cease-fire. They have forgotten the Bible’s long-term judicial strategy: the suppression of biblically defined public evil in every area of life, by every covenant institu- tion, each in its own God-authorized sphere of responsibility. They have forgotten about covenant law and covenant sanctions. Such a view clearly sets limits on the extension of political pluralism. There is an additional God-reve,ded limitation on the modern pluralist order, however, one which today’s pluralists refuse to acknowledge: civil government must not collect as much as 10 percent of its cz”tizens’ annual net income to use in its various assignments (I Sam. 8). This tax limitation keeps the State small, which is not what today’s Chris- tian pluralists, so dominated intellectually and institutionally by Darwinian State-worshippers, want to accept as a governing princi- ple. They have forgotten Samuel’s warning regarding State power. They have forgotten Deuteronomy 17’s warnings to the kings of Israel. This is not random amnesia.

The fact that, as individuals, they wrote checks on accounts with cash in them prior to 1980 does not offset the fact that they are a trio of check-kiters today. They write from one account to the other, with each check ever-larger, in the vain hope that their kite can keep flying. They also write checks to each other’s accounts, drawing on their own empty accounts. Nell writes something that supports 227.

Slow Learners I write in this book’s Conclusion that Christians seem to learn more slowly than their opponents during the “waking up phase” of any era. While our enemies are “sealing the tomb” to prevent us from faking the resurrection which they fear above all (Matt. 27:62-66), we Christians are fleeing from the scene of judgment in confusion.

The only thing that saves Christians is that God does direct every event in history, and the progressive manifestation of God’s kingdom in history does take place. The first stages of this “resurrection” of Christian society take place without the awareness by Christians, let alone their public approval. Eventually, however, a minority of Christians will wake up, re-group, and begin the work of compre- hensive dominion anew. We have seen this again and again in his- tory, most notably during the Protestant Reformation — a fact of his- tory which nearly gags Protestant leaders today, especially college- level historians. These newly awakened Christians do not receive moral support from the Church’s intellectual leaders of the sleeping phase; the lat- ter have too much of their personal and intellectual capital invested in the dying world of the sealed tomb. Like the Hebrew assistants to the Egyptian taskmasters, or like the slave “trustees” of the Southern plantation system, those who bear the tenured whip in the name of the slave-masters resent any signs of God’s deliverance in history.

Conclusion Christian political pluralist Gordon Spykman rests his case for pluralism not on the Bible but on history, since “confessional diver- sity or religious heterogeneity is a historical reality.” He insists that we must recognize “the dialectic that exists in history because of sin and the counter-acting effect of God’s grace; a conflict is occurring between the city of God and the city of the world, between the king- dom of light and the kingdom of darkness.”228 He is quite correct, and this same tension and war existed in Old Testament Israel, in which political pluralism was forbidden by God’s revealed law. Strangers in the gate did not serve as civil judges. T. M. Moore, commenting on Spykman’s presentation, remarks that “his belief that history provides ultimate norms — creational norms — which should direct our interpretation of the Bible. Yet such an approach exalts the analytical powers of man’s mind above the plain words of the text of Scripture and ignores the supremacy of God’s revelation over mere human interpretations (cf. Isa. 55: 8-9; 2 Pet. 1: 20-21 ).” 229 The truth of this accusation applies equally well to The Search for Christian Arnm”ca. I argue in this chapter that The Search for Christian America is not a serious piece of historical scholarship. Yet I also admit that our trio as individuals had previously written academically reputable books. In those earlier books and essays, the authors presented evidence that America was from the beginning a Christian nation, and that any attempt to deny these origins is comparable to Marsden’s charge against Perry Miller: an attempt to de-Christianize a self-consciously Christian people. By the time these men (like myself) reached grad- uate school, secular historians had done too much research showing the Christian roots of the United States. It was no longer academically respectable to promote a pure, unvarnished Progressivist version of 228.

In short, the historical profession in the 1970’s knew their pri- mary source documents, or at least knew the story second-hand from Miller and Edmund Morgan. It was no longer possible to fool them with a tale of a humanist, pluralist America, at least up to the ratifi- cation of the Constitution. But it is quite possible to fool Christians, who are usually the products of inane public school textbooks, and whose knowledge of the primary sources is negligible. Therefore, our trio spotted an opportunity: to write a pluralist tract for the Christians, in the hope that few secular historians would ever criticize it publicly, since one does not criticize American political pluralism on today’s campus, even though any historian knowledgeable regarding the sources would spot the misleading nature of this tract’s thesis. What they did not count on was me. At the beginning of this book’s Introduction, I listed five prob- lems with the philosophy of political pluralism. Let me list a sixth: pluralism seems to lead to what can polite~ be termed be the ‘hognzlive dysfunc- tion” of its Christian defenders. When you devote your intellectual career to defending a political philosophy based on rival principles from those you espouse on Sunday morning, it turns your thought proc- esses into the equivalent of Silly Putty. The Forbidden Guide We must be careful: our trio warns us, ‘not uncritically to accept generically Christian tradition as a social-political guide. Such tradition is always mixed with other heritages and influences, so we must always test it in the refiner’s fire.”zso Wait a minute. What are they really saying here? What do they mean, “guide”? What other guide — what other blueprint — should Christians use? Why should Christians use any guide other than the guide set forth in the Bible? Why, in the name of Darwin, should we accept political pluralism as our guide? Why should we avoid adopting a theocentric guide – a “generically Christian tradition”- as a guide to the future? So what if during the last century and a half there was a “mixed multitude” in American politics? This tells us something about the Constitution, but it tells us nothing about the covenantal foundation of America before 1788. 230.

They take an ideal of biblical law, and then they say that America never measured up. They except only the Puritans, who, we are assured, did not estab- lish a truly Christian commonwealth. Well, so what? Neither did Israel measure up. Neither did Judah. Does this mean that neither Israel nor Judah was judged in history by God? On the contrary, the ve~ fact of God5 historic ~“udgments testifies to the reali~ of the covenant. The United States is still a Christian nation. It is under the cove- nant sanctions of God, positive and negative. It may be a Christian nation in the sense that Israel was a covenanted nation just before the Assyrians invaded, or as Judah was when Nebuchadnezzar’s forces had surrounded the city, but this does not deny the covenant. These three men have looked at the evidence and have rejected it. Yet the very imperfection of the American people’s subsequent com- mitment to this historic covenant is what now threatens us: a broken covenant is nonetheless a covenant when it comes to the question of God’s nega- tive sanctions in histogt It is this that our three scholars have devoted their careers to denying. Broken Covenants A man who publicly denies his baptismal vows is surely under the negative sanctions of that covenant, even though he is no longer a Christian. He no longer has legal access to the communion table, which is a blessing removed from him. A husband who commits adultery and is subsequently divorced by his wife is surely under the negative sanctions of the original marriage covenant, even though he is no longer married. He no longer has legal access to her bed, which is a blessing removed from him. Presumably, our trio admits this. But then it comes to the civil covenant, and they call, “King’s X.” They mean King Man. No covenant here! No negative sanc- tions here! Pluralist man gets endless access to the land, a blessing of the covenant, only now this no longer has anything to do with positive covenantal sanctions. Access to the land is said to be covenantally ruwtral, or covenantally irrelevant, which is the same thing. And so, to use the analogy of the marriage covenant, they call their fellow Christians to continue to commit political adultery as a way of life — in fact, the only legitimate way of life.

Man worries about man’s sanctions. To which Jesus replied: “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell” (Matt. 10:28). And how do we know that such a final negative sanction is possible? Because we are given preliminary sanctions: “And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the L ORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I tes- tify against you this day that ye shall surely perish. As the nations which the L ORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish; be- cause ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the L ORD your God” (Deut. 8:19-20). The Canaanites did not inherit the land of Israel; the Roman Empire did, and then the Christians, and then the Arabs. God will not “give America back to the Indians,” either. He may give it to the Communists, and then to someone else. God is not mocked. A Time for Histon”cal Revisionism I agree with our trio’s viewpoint regarding the American Chris- tian political tradition after 1789. By law (Article VI, Clause 3), it has been formally based on political pluralism at the national level (see Part 3: “Apostate Covenantalism”). Political pluralism has pro- gressively become the traditional political philosophy in most Chris- tian circles. I also agree that a mythical view of the Christianity of the Constitution’s primary promoters must not be uncritically ac- cepted any longer. And surely it is our responsibility to test the story of the Constitution “in the refiner’s fire.” But this is where I part com- pany with our trio. We disagree over the nature of this fire. What is this refiner’s fire? Biblical law. If not biblical law, then what? I know. The ethical insights of H.

They were striving to push as far into the background as possible the order of things that exists by inevitable equilibrium, that is fulfilled by unconscious and aimless motions, that is determined by inertia and inexorable law, and in its place to set up an order founded upon voluntary choice, upon the deliberate assumption of obligation, upon unconstrained pacts, upon the sov- ereign determinations of free wills. They were struggling to extricate man from the relentless primordial mechanism, from the chains of instinct and fear, to set him upon his own feet, to endow him with a knowledge of utility and purpose, with the faculties to implement his knowledge, so that he might rationally choose and not be driven from pillar to post by fate or circumstance. They were inspired, even though but half conscious of their motive, with a desire to transform the concept of duty from something imposed brutally and irration- ally by an ultimate datum into something to which man himself ra- tionally and willingly consented.

Francis SchaeJler (1968)1 The spirit of this world has for almost two millennia clouded Christian philosophy by means of the doctrine of natural law. The Church has adopted variations of an intensely pagan philosophy based on neutrality, universal categories of reason, and the Greek idea of salvation through knowledge: “know thyself.” It has overlaid these doctrines on top of Paul’s discussion of universal categories of ethics in the human heart: For there is no respect of persons with God. For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law; (For not the hearers of the law are just be- fore God, but the doers of the law shall be justified. For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;) In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel (Rem. 2:11-16).

This light of internal revelation, through God’s restraining grace (“com- mon grace”), enables human society to function in history. God does not allow men to become totally consistent with their own covenant- breaking presuppositions. 2 But to the extent that men become con- sistent with their covenant-breaking religions, they depart from this testimony of God’s ethical standards. Thus, natural law theory as a concept separated from biblical revelation is like every other doctrine separated from biblical revelation: wrong. The outline of autonomous law is wrong; the judicial content is also wrong. Darwinism destroyed natural law theory. Secular scholars very seldom take seriously the tradition of natural rights. (A handful of libertarian anarcho-capitalists do.) Only in the twentieth century have we seen a few systematic efforts by Calvinistic Christians to abandon natural law and “natural rights theories. But they have not “gone the distance” in abandoning natural law, for to do so automat- ically and necessarily delivers society into either judicial chaos or theocracy. Christians do not want either alternative. Thus, they are given larger and larger doses of moral chaos, interspersed with per- iods of arbitrary tyranny. This is all that the philosophy of autono- mous man has ever been able to deliver in theory, and what it is now delivering in practice. We have seen in the writings of Van Til, Schaeffer, and the trio of historians – Nell, Hatch, and Marsden – variations of the same theme: the illegitimacy of at least three and probably four points of the biblical civil covenant. They do not explain the details of biblical civil hierarchy: the mutual representation of God and His covenant people – God before men and men before God – by civil magis- trates. They reject the Old Testament-revealed civil law-order, the historical sanctions attached to this law-order, and the postmillennial implications of these historic sanctions. What is then left of the idea of the biblical covenant in civil government? Nothing concrete. Not biblical law, not natural law (our Calvinist scholars are too sophisti- cated epistemologically for that), not Newtonian law, not existen- tialist law — nothing. The category of civil law is open-ended. This is a denial of covenant theology. Nothing is ethically open- ended in history. All of man’s history is under the ethical terms of the 2.

Schaeffer was unwilling to follow Van Til in this absolute rejection of the reasoning of covenant-breaking man. He repeatedly returned to the natural law-natural rights lan- guage of the American Constitutional settlement.

The first question was: Who taught the tutors of the members of the Virginia dynasty?” And the second question was like unto it: What books did the mem- bers of that dynasty read?” He did not answer these questions in great detail, but the general answers he suggested were these: the tutors, more often than not, were taught in some Scottish university, and the books they assigned to their students were the books of the Scottish Enlightenment.

In clan societies, the family also must an- swer this question, but there are few clan societies remaining in the West. To ask this question regarding the founders is to ask a dis- tinctly covenantal question. And a covenantal question always has five essential and inescapable parts in relation to founding: 1. On whose authority did the Founder act? 2. What kind of authority did the Founder impose? 3. What were the boundaries that he established? 4. What kind of sanctions does his institution impose? 5. What are the connecting links between him and us? In a church, the answer to the first question is clear: on God’s au- thority. Second, the Founder imposed a church hierarchy. Third, the church has boundaries, which are theological and legal. Fourth, most churches have membership lists, and therefore sanctions. The church’s primary sanction is excommunication: cutting off a deviant member from access to the Lord’s Supper (communion). Churches with open communion and no membership roles adopt other, less visible and less clear forms of sanctions, but there are always positive and negative sanctions in any organization. Finally, the question of membership. The link between the Founder and today’s member may be confessional (in creedal churches), emotional, liturgical, or legal (membership), or any mixture thereof. In the case of im- migrant churches, it may be linguistic or racial. Nations have an analogous set of questions. First, in whose name did the Founder act? His own (the charismatic leader)? His family’s (patriarchal-traditional)? The Party’s (ideological)? God’s (theologi- cal)? Nature’s (rational)? Someone had to authorize it. There had to be an author. Second, what is the nature of the national organization’s hierar- chy? What is the basis of obedience? Personal allegiance (military- patriarchal)? Theocratic investiture (theocracy)? Public investiture (democracy)? The leader’s office (bureaucracy)? Third, what are the boundaries of political authority? Boun- daries are both geographical and legal. In other words, what are the limits of political authority? Fourth, what are the positive and negative sanctions of govern- ment? Are they essentially negative (limited government)?

Legal adoption? Elec- tion? Naturalization? People are born and they die. They move. They change allegiances. Societies and civil governments must deal with these facts of life and death. To do so, they create judicially binding public events, events that are best understood as acts of cove- nant renewal. An election is an act of covenant renewal. So is swear- ing an oath of office. Especial~ swearing an oath of office, for the oath explicitly or implicitly calls down the negative sanctions of the cove- nant, should the swearer break the legal terms of the covenant. Covenantalism: An Inescapable Concept This section of Political Po@heism deals primarily with the politi- cal and judicial implications of point four of the biblical covenant model: oaths/sanctions. This is not to say that none of the other points is involved. A covenant is presented to men as a unit, and it is either accepted or rejected as a unit. When we deal with any of God’s covenant institutions, we must consider all five aspects of the biblical covenant model. Following Ray Sutton’s model, 1 I divide up the covenant into these five points: Transcendence (sovereignty), yet immanence (presence) Hierarchy/authority/representation Ethics/law/dominion Oath/judgment/sanctions (blessings, cursings) Successionlcontinuitylinheritance All three of the authorized corporate covenant institutions – Church government, family government, and civil government – must bear the institutional marks of these five points. There is no escape. All five are basic to each of the covenant institutions. The covenant may identify a god different from the God of the Bible, but the covenant structure itself is inescapable. There can be no govern- ment apart from this structure. The covenant is an inescapable con- cept. It is never a question of “covenant vs. no covenant .“ It is 1. Ray R.

Because Western Protestantism ever since the late seventeenth century has cooperated with the forces of rationalism in abandoning the original covenantal foundations of Western civilization, we still face a 300-year-old dilemma. It is most acute in the United States, where vestiges of the older covenantd Christianity still remain, and where the conflict between covenant-breakers and covenant-keepers has visibly escalated since about 1975. American Church historian Sidney Mead stated the nature of the intellectual problem, which has now begun to assert itself as a cultural and political problem – an ancient one in American history. Writing in 1953, he observed: But the great item of unfinished intellectual business confronting the Protestant denominations was and is the problem of religious freedom. And here the situation is almost as desperate as increasingly it becomes clear that the problem cannot be solved simply by maligning the character of those who question the American practice. Is it not passing strange that American Protestantism has never devel- oped any sound theoretical justification of or theological orientation for its most distinctive practice? Today we should probably have to agree with the writer of 1876 who said that “we seem to have made no advance whatever in harmonizing (on a theoretical level) the relations of religious sects among themselves, or in defining their common relation to the Civil power.”z Part 3 of Political Po&theism asks the question: To what extent is the U.S. Constitution a covenant document? If I can show that it is a covenant document, then a second question arises: What kind of covenant, Christian or secular humanist?

John Winthrop of the Massachu- setts Bay Colony rather than George Washington deserves the title of Founding Father. So, however, does Roger Williams, for because of Williams, George Washington and the Framers became politically possible. I argue that the Constitution, like the charter of colonial Rhode Island, is a substitute covenant. This is not the standard text- book account of the Constitution, or a standard anything account. But it is a true account, assuming that the Bible is true. I assume that it is. Warren Burger, the former Chief Justice of the U. S. Supreme Court, has offered his opinion that “The United States, as a true na- tion, was conceived in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787, but it was not yet born until the document was ratified.”3 This sentence sum- marizes what I call the myth of the Constitution as the sole cove- nantal basis of the nation we call the United States of America. I contend that this myth is the legacy of a humanist conspiracy — a conspiracy which may be about to be escalated once again. The Declaration of Independence of the United States against Great Britain in 1776 was a formal declaration of political independ- ence. It was the first step in a more important Declaration of Inde- pendence: a covenantal declaration of independence from the God of the Bible. That latter declaration is the document we know as the U. S. Constitution. To prove my point, I have written Part 3. I focus on the crucial but much-neglected section of the Constitu- tion, the one prohibiting religious test oath’s: “The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all the executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States” (Article 111, Clause 3).

One’s presuppositions about the nature of God, man, law, and time 4 shape one’s interpretation of all facts. There is no brute factuality, as Van Til always insisted; there is only interpreted factuality. The history of the origins of the U.S. Constitution in the twentieth century has been a debate between the old Whig view — an instrument written by men who sought to increase human liberty — and the eco- nomic-Marxist-B eardian view: a document written by a particular economic class of men who were seeking economic advantage. There has also been a modified Tory view, represented by the “imperial” histories written by men like Charles M. Andrews and Lawrence H. Gipson, who argue that things really were not so bad, 1763-75, and that the disputes could have been worked out between the colonies and Great Britain within the framework of the imperial system. The Whig view, however, has predominated. This view goes back to the very era of the Constitution itself, to South Carolinian David Ramsey. There have been wide variations within this tradition, re- flecting the divisions within the Constitutional Convention: big gov- ernment (Hamiltonian Federalist), limited government (Jefferso- nian republican), and states’ rights.

They had basically lost the war by 1684, marked by the revocation of the Massachusetts charter under Charles II, who died in 1685. After the Glorious Revolution against James II — a Whig revolution — of 1688-89, Massachusetts was granted a new royal charter (1691), but one which was no longer Puritan in origin. Voting henceforth was regulated strictly in terms of property ownership, not religion. Covenantally speaking, the lawyers and the merchants in- herited the Puritan commonwealth. The Rhode Island Experiment Theologically and even covenantally, this was not the beginning of the battle; this was the beginning of the end. The first skirmish in the struggle to create the modern world was in the winter of 1636, when Roger Williams fled Massachusetts and headed into the wil- derness of what was to become Rhode Island. Williams successfully created a new colony, but it was far more than a new colony; it was a new concept of civil government. It was a concept that has become dominant today — the very distinguishing mark of modernism. He founded a colony that was openly secular; there would be no Church- State connection, or even a religion-State connection. In 1642, the General Court of Rhode Island organized a new government. It required an oath of office from magistrates to “walk faithfully” and taken “in the presence of God.”5 There was no other mention of religion. The colony’s civil government was formally rec- ognized as “a democracy, or popular government .“6 In March of 1644 (old calendar, 1643), Charles I granted a charter to the Provi- dence Plantations. In response, in 1647, acts and orders were agreed upon. The colony was again identified as “democratical,” meaning “a government held by the free and voluntary consent of all, or the greater part of the free inhabitants.” 7 It admitted the existence of “our different consciences touching the truth as it is in Jesus,” and affirmed “each man’s peaceable and quiet enjoyment of his lawful right and liberty. . . . “s They enacted civil laws and sanctions for various crimes, including murder, rebellion, misbehavior, witch- 5. “Organization of the Government of Rhode Island, March 16-19, 1641/42 ,“ in W.

Instead, they made this statement: These are the laws that concern all men, and these are the penalties for transgression thereof, which, by common assent, and ratified and estab- lished throughout the whole colony; and otherwise than thus what is herein forbidden, all men may walk as their consciences persuade them, everyone in the name of his god. And let the saints of the most high walk in this col- ony without molestation in the name of Jehovah, their God for ever and ever, etc., etc. g This meant, however, that non-saints had the same civil powers and immunities, that they, too, could walk in the colony without moles- tation, and more to the point covenantally, vote in all colonial elec- tions, “everyone in the name of his god,” or lack thereof. In 1663, Charles II, as a self-identified Chrktian monarch, granted to them in the name of “the true Christian ffaith,” a special dispensa- tion: they would not have to worship God according to the Church of England, “or take or subscribe the oaths and articles made and es- tablished in that behalfe; . . .” The charter then adopted language that was to be repeated again and again in the next hundred years of charter-granting and constitution-making: “. . . noe person within the sayd colonye, at any tyme hereafter, shall bee any wise molested, punished, disquieted, or called into question, for any differences in opinione in matters of religion, and doe not actually disturb the civill peace of our sayd colony: . . .” IO This he called a “hopefull under- takeinge.”li The charter mentioned “the good Providence of God, from whome the Plantations have taken their name,”lz but that was a mere formality; the heart of the experiment was judicial.

The State Divi- sion of Taxation of the state of Rhode Island granted tax exemption to the religion of witchcraft. All covens in the state must henceforth be treated for tax purposes as any other legitimate church. Conclusion It is my contention – argued, many will say, contentiously– that the experiment in political pluralism in the Rhode Island wilderness set the standard for all modern political developments. It was the first civil order in the West to break with the concept of Trinitarian civil covenantalism. This tiny colony, established self-consciously as an alternative to the theocracy of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was the birthplace of modern political pluralism. More than this, I contend that the major arguments in defense of Christian political pluralism invariably sound like those used by Williams to justify his opposition to, and departure from, Massachusetts. The political history of the United States after 1689 has essentially been the extension of Roger Williams’ view of civil government, as opposed to John Winthrop’s. 14 The defenders of democracy have not often quoted either man, but they have quoted Williams more often. Williams and his colleagues laid the covenantal foundations for modern democracy, but they have not been given sufficient credit for their pioneering effort. Modern defenders of democracy prefer to avoid naming Jesus in their defenses of political pluralism. They are therefore far more consistent in their understanding of the theology of pluralism. It is mainly Christian defenders of political pluralism who are drawn to Williams these days. But if Rhode Island was not the explicit political-theological rep- resentative model in eighteenth-century colonial America, what was? We must begin therefore with the question: What were the reli- gious and intellectual roots of the U.S. Constitution? 13. Ibid., I, p. 121. 14. Edmund S.

John Witherspoon. He was the teacher of the man who is often called the Father of the Constitution, James Madison. G He was a signer of the Declaration of Independence, the only minis- ter of the gospel to do so. Witherspoon serves as perhaps the best example in the history of the Christian Church as a man who defended a halfway covenant philosophy and subsequently pressed for an apostate national cove- nant. He was the most prominent clergyman in the colonies during the Revolutionary War. He was hated by the British. When British troops captured Rev.

He did not merely sign the Declaration of Independence; he symbolically signed his brightest student’s 200-year (or more) jail sentence for the American Church. Witherspoon, in the name of Calvin’s God, substituted Locke’s compact theory of civil government for biblical covenantalism: society as contractual, not covenantal. He did not distinguish society from the State. “Society I would define to be an association or com- pact of any number of persons, to deliver up or abridge some part of their natural rights, in order to have the strength of the united body, to protect the remaining, and to bestow others.”8 Sovereign men agree with each other to set up a hierarchy, to pass and enforce laws, and to bestow rights on others in the future. Here is the Lockean covenant in all its autonomous grandeur. Society is a “voluntary compact” among equals. g Most important, his discussion of oaths was limited strictly to contracts (person to person) and vows: per- sonal promises between God and an individual. Oaths, he says, “are appendages to all lawful contracts; . . . “1° He did not discuss cove- nants as oath-bound contracts among men in which God is the en- forcing party. Had he done so, he would have had to abandon Locke and the whole Whig tradition. Witherspoon made the assumption that there is a common sense logical realism that links the logical processes of all men, Christians and non-Christians. He appealed to this common sense realism in his defense of the Christian faith. This was the heritage of eighteenth- century Scottish rationalism, the birthplace of the right wing of the Enlightenment. Because he believed that there is such a realm of neutral human reason, it was easy for Witherspoon to fall into the trap of believing in common principles of political philosophy. After all, this was the common error of a generation of level-headed Scots who were in the 8.

It was the most common cultural error of eighteenth-century English- speaking Protestantism. It was also the most devastating; it led to the transfer of political and judicial authority to the humanists. Yet Rushdoony adds this cryptic evaluation: “This confusion, however, was slight in contrast to other phenomena of the American scene .“ On the contrary, this was the heart of that confusion, a confusion which led to the public breaking of the civil covenants of the first cen- tury and a half of American political life. That Rushdoony did not see how devastating the results of this confusion were points to an al- most equally great confusion on Rushdoony’s part. (See Appendix B.) Without citing his source, Rushdoony says that Witherspoon trained many of the future leaders of the new nation. They included a president (James Madison), a Vice President (Aaron Burr), 10 cabinet officers, 21 U.S. Senators, 39 congressmen, and 12 governors. He could have added that six served in the Continental Congress and 56 served in state legislatures. Furthermore, of the 25 college graduates at the Constitutional Convention, nine were Prince- tonians and six had Witherspoon’s signature on their diplomas. 11 The magnitude of what these men did – breaking the civil covenants of the original colonial settlement — testifies to the catastrophic con- fusion in Witherspoon’s system. Madison, after remaining in New Jersey to study with Witherspoon for an extra year, returned to Virginia and vowed to devote his life to overturning the religious oaths required to hold public office in Virginia, a task that he and Jefferson achieved in early 1786. He was not in re- volt against his teacher; he was applying what he had been taught, as he continued to do for the remainder of his career. 12 The next year, he did much better (or worse) than this: he made illegal any such oath at the national level. Yet it was Witherspoon who had introduced him to the writings of the Scottish Enlightenment philosophers through his syllabus on “Moral Philosophy”: David Hume, Francis Hutcheson, Adam Smith, Thomas Reid, Lord Kames, and Adam Ferguson. It was these writings, he later said, that had brought him to his views on civil and religious liberty, 13 i.e., apostate covenantalism. 11. Varnum Lansing Collins, President Witherspoon, 2 vols.

Constitution 321 Who Taught the Lawyers? William Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England was pub- lished in 1765. Almost immediately, it became the standard textbook for apprentices in law in the American colonies. It is occasionally re- ferred to in American history textbooks, but it is seldom read today. In retrospect, it seems strange that we should identify him as the teacher of American colonial lawyers. He was a staunch defender of the absolute judicial sovereignty of Parliament; any law that was physically possible for Parliament to enforce was valid law, he in- sisted. In short, he denied his other operating presupposition: the binding authority of natural law. Americans paid less and less atten- tion to this aspect of Blackstone’s theories as the Revolution ap- proached and then broke out. They took what they liked from his system and ignored the rest. To answer the question, “In whose authority did the Framers act ?“ we need first to go to Blackstone. The Commentaries provide an official answer, yet one which hides a far more important clue as to the nature of the Constitutional covenant and its true author. In one of the few passages comprehensible to readers who are not intimately familiar with the intricacies of the English common law up to 1765, Blackstone wrote: This law of nature, being co-eval with mankind and dictated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times: no human laws are of any-valid- it y, if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original. But in order to apply this to the particular exigencies of each individual, it is still necessary to have recourse to reason; whose office it is to discover, as was before observed, what the law of nature directs in every circum- stance of life; by considering, what method will tend the most effectually to our own substantial happiness. 14 Blackstone said that he believed in a literal ethical fall of a literal man. The fall of man had corrupted human reason. “And if our rea- son were always, as in our first ancestor before his transgression, 14. William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, 4 vols.

But every man now finds the contrary in his own experience; that his reason is cor- rupt, and his understanding full of ignorance and error.” 15 There- fore, God gave us revelation regarding His law in the Bible. “The doctrines thus delivered we call the revealed or divine law, and they are to be found only in the holy scriptures .“ 16 He went so far as to argue that “the revealed law is (humanly speaking) of infinitely more authority than what we generally call the natural law.” He based this conclusion on the weakness of human reason to understand the natural law. Revealed law is more certain. “If we could be as certain of the latter as we are of the former, both would have an equal authority; but, till then, they can never be put in any competition together.” 17 Undermining Biblical Law Having said this, he then spent four volumes describing English common law with only a few footnote references to the Bible. In the first three volumes, running almost 500 pages each, each has one footnote reference to the Bible. The fourth volume, on criminal law (Public Wrongs), has ten references. Not one of them was taken by Blackstone as authoritative for civil law; they were seen merely as historical examples. There is not a single reference to “Bible,” “Moses,” or “Revelation” in the set’s index. How could this be if he was persuaded that biblical law and natu- ral law are the same, but with biblical law so much clearer to us? Blackstone’s preliminary remarks were commonplaces for the era. Englishmen commonly tipped the brims of their epistemological caps to God and the Bible, but they did not take off their caps in the presence of God. They pursued their academic specialties just as Christians do today: with no systematic study of what biblical law specifically reveals regarding those disciplines. It was considered sufficient for Blackstone to have formally equated biblical law with natural law. Having done so, he could then safely ignore biblical law. This common equation of biblical law with natural law faced two monumental problems in the eighteenth century: ‘1) the continuing 15. Idem. 16. Ibid., I, p. 42. 17.

Biblical higher criticism was a cen- tury old in English religious thought and politics by the time Blackstone wrote his Commentaries. 19 Thus, by the time that the Com- mentan”es appeared, the foundation of his defense of the superiority of biblical law to natural law – the greater clarity of biblical revelation compared to reasdm’s perception of natural law — was not believed by most men who called themselves educated. This raises another question: Was Blackstone in fact deliberately lying? In a perceptive essay by David Berman, we learn of a strategy that had been in use for over almost a century: combatting a position by supporting it with arguments that are so weak that they in fact prove the opposite. This was a tactic used by those who did not be- lieve in immortality to promote their skepticism. Berman makes a very s’hrewd observation regarding academic historians and schol- ars: “Most of us do not like liars or lying; nor are we inclined to ac- cept conspiracy theories or explanations that postulate secret codes or cabals. These aversions may explain why the art of theological lying has been so generally ignored. . . . “2° There is at least reason- able suspicion that Blackstone was lying; if he was not, then he was naive beyond description, for his lame defense of biblical revelation greatly assisted the political triumph of the enemies of Christianity in the American colonies. 18.

It has served as the integrating legal framework for the United States for two centuries. People around the world give lip service to its greatness, although no other nation operates in terms of a constitu- tion modeled after the U.S. Constitution. The conservative colum- nist Richard Grenier is correct: “It has never occurred to most Americans that their Republic – the first democratic state on a na- tional scale — adopted a Constitution that has been taken seriously as an enduring model by nobody. I said, nobody.”zz While other na- tions have sometimes attempted to rewrite their national govern- ments in terms of it, some coup comes, or some revolution, and sweeps away any traces of the imported document. The Constitution apparently cannot be successfully exported. It was the product of a unique set of historical circumstances that ~annot be duplicated, cir- cumstances so fundamental to the coming of the Constitution that without them, the document cannot operate successfully. It is not surprising that many present-day religious and political groups in the United States want to take credit for it. Over a century ago, in the midst of the Civil War, B. F. Morris wrote his massive (but unfortunately unfootnoted) Christian Lye and Character of the Civil Institutions of the United States (1864). He made a cogent case for the Christian foundations of American Constitutional history. A similar theme has been pursued by Verna ‘Hall and Rosalie Slater in their Christian HistoT of the Constitution series of reprinted primary source documents and extracts from uncopyrighted late nineteenth-century politically conservative humanist history textbooks. 21. I am not arguing that Englishmen trusted a priori reason as the sole guide to human institutions; they also placed great weight on historical experience. My point is only that they placed almost zero practical weight on Old Testament law and ex- perience, and when they cited the Old Testament, they did so because it was merely one historical source among many. 22.

Yet this view of the Constitution has always had its challengers, for good reasons. There was little mention of theology and ecclesiasti- cal influences in the common textbook histories of America until the late 1930’s. This change came about largely as a result of Harvard’s Perry Miller and his student Edmund Morgan, who taught history at Yale. Miller rehabilitated the Puritans and early American Prot- estant religious ideas, beginning in the 1930’s, and Morgan carried on this tradition. The fact remains, however, that John Locke, who was a cautious Trinitarian, made no mention of Christianity in presenting the case for political liberty in his Second Treatise of Government (published in 1690; written around 1682). 23 It was to the Second Treatise that literate defenders of English liberties in the American colonies (but only rarely in Whig England) 24 appealed in the mid-eighteenth century, not to his Paraphrase and Notes on tb Epistles of St. Paul, which were non- political, z5 or his book, written in the last years of his life, when he returned openly to Christianity, Tk Reasonublenas of Chn~tiani@ (1695). 2b We find few references to the Christian religion in Cato’s Letters and The Independent Whig, the anticlerical 27 and libertarian English newspapers of the 1720’s that became popular reading in the colonies in the 17 70’s, according to John Adams 28 and patriot historian David Ramsey. 29 At best, the biblical element in ‘Whi#’ political theory 23.

The political discourse of the age was dominated by classical allusions, not by Hebraic ones. The cur- ricula of the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge had always been grounded on the ideal of thorough knowledge of the pagan classics, and even the Puritans, while always officially skeptical about such training, and always filled with fear and trembling about its threat to the soul, were forced to submit their ministerial candidates and the sons of the gentry and merchants to the classroom rigors of the hu- manists, generation after generation.

The classical educational model of Oxford and Cambridge did its steady work of secularization in the English-speaking world, even in Puritan Harvard and Yale. Decade by decade, the two universities moved toward epistemological Unitarianism, and in the early nine- teenth century, official Unitarianism triumphed. 43 But this commit- ment to the classics was steadily tempered, not by Christianity, but by Newtonian science. “In the second half of the seventeenth cen- tury,” writes Morgan, ‘as the impact of Hobbes, Locke, and Newton illustrates, men were seeking knowledge of a new fixity in their lives and in the world around them .* 44 In the eighteenth, this quest for fixity accelerated. The college curricula did not change, but the spirit and motivation of educated men did.

The question raised by Professor Pangle is legitimate: To what extent was this verbal appeal back to Rome rhetorical? He believes, as I do, that the Framers were essentially “moderns” rather than “an- cients .“ They were far more influenced by late seventeenth-century social thought than by the events of Roman history, let alone classi- cal political philosophy, which had little impact on them except in a negative sense. “Generally speaking, the ancients, in contrast to the American Founders, appear to place considerably less emphasis on protecting individuals and their ‘rights’ – rights to private property and family safety, to property, to freedom of religion, and to the ‘pur- suit of happiness.’ “4 5 Also, he argues – 1,believe correctly – that the classical philosophers put virtue above fraternity and liberty.4G The Framers, while they discussed the need for virtue and religion – always carefully undefined – did so as defenders of political and eco- 43.

In this, the y were not fundamentally different in principle from Robespierre, who established a formal civic religion of nature and reason in the midst of the Terror in 1794. De-Christianization was morally debilitating, Robespierre concluded; it had to be followed by the establishment of a new civic religion. 48 He knew that men needed to believe in God’s sanctions in order to keep them obedient. Talmon identifies this impulse as “cosmic pragmatism.”4g The major figures among the Framers were wiser men than Robespierre, more influenced by traditional Christianity, but they were Enlightenment men to the core; their veneer and their constituencies were different from those of the French Revolutionaries, but not their theology. Their religion was civic religion. The difference is, they saw civic re- ligion as a decentralized, individual matter rather than as a State affair; it was to aid the national government but not be part of the national government. Unitarian John Adams wrote in his autobio- graphy, presumably for himself and not the electorate: One great advantage of the Christian religion is that it brings the great principle of the law of nature and nations, Love your neighbour as yourself, and do to others as you would that others should do to you, to the knowl- edge, belief and veneration of the whole people. Children, servants, women and men are all professors in the science of public as well as private moral- ity. No other institution for education, no kind of political discipline, could diffuse this kind of necessary information, so universally among all ranks and descriptions of citizens. The duties and rights of the man and the citi- zen are thus taught, from early infancy to every creature. The sanctions of a future life are thus added to the observance of civil and political as well as domestic and private duties.

The Right Wing of the Enlightenment In my view, it is Rushdoony’s greatest single historiographical er- ror that he has always downplayed the Enlightenment influence on eighteenth-century American history. 51 At the heart of the Enlight- enment’s right-wing branch philosophically (the Scottish Enlighten- ment) 52 and also its left-wing branch (the French #.ilow@es, but above all Rousseau) were the doctrines of natural law and natural rights. This commitment to natural law, in fact, was what made both branches part of the same movement. Their main differences were historical: different enemies. It would not be far from wrong to sum- marize the origins of the two wings as follows: The Scottish Enlightenment philosophy was developed by Presby- terians who had abandoned Christian orthodoxy, but who maintained certain outward forms of belief by substituting a new humanistic theory of contracts for the Calvinistic theory of covenants. 53 Con- tinental Enlightenment philosophy was developed by graduates of Roman Catholic institutions who had abandoned Christianity alto- gether, and who substituted the State for the Church as the agency of social salvation. 54 51.

For the most part, their most prominent figures were non-Trinitarian in their theology, uninterested in questions of theol- ogy and ecclesiology except insofar as these questions in any way in- terfered with political liberty as they saw it. Their influence in the colonies was all-pervasive. Writes Bailyn: “The colonists identified themselves with these seventeenth-century heroes of liberty: but they felt closer to the early eighteenth-century writers who modified and enlarged this earlier body of ideas, fused it into a whole with other, contemporary strains of thought, and, above all, applied it to the problems of eighteenth-century English politics. . . .

Their leaders included Joseph Priestley, the chemist and theologian, and his friend Richard Price, the economist and theologian, who were both hostile to Trinitarianism. Their influence in America increased as anti-English activities escalated after 1770. These were the radical republicans. Their intellectual roots can be traced back to Barrington.

This was the doctrine of natural law, made by God, evident to every man, consonant with the best parts of the tradi- tional law of England but superior to any law or government which was ar- bitrary or unjust. When, on the brink of open rebellion, Americans needed an intellectual resource more potent than the rights of Englishmen to justify actions so obviously seditious as the Boston Tea Party, they turned to the rights-of-man teaching of their staunchest English supporters. [Writes Clinton Rossiter: ] “Not until the argument shifted substantially away from English rights and over to natural justice did Price and Priestley influence American minds.”6z This hostility to religious oaths as a requirement of holding polit- ical office was basic to the Dissenters and Protestant nonconformists generally, who faced an oath of allegiance to the Church of England and not just to the Trinity.’3 This same hostility later flared up at the Constitutional Convention, as we shall see. The intellectual basis of the crucial alliance in 1787 between dis- senting Protestantism and incipient Unitarianism was the shared faith in natural law. Where did this faith come from? It should be clear that it did not come from Thomas Aquinas or medieval scho- lasticism generally. The Framers did not read the scholastics, nor did many other Protestant thinkers of the eighteenth century. They were far more likely to read Ren6 Descartes, or summaries of his thought .

This was what Sir Isaac Newton’s Princifiia gave to mankind in 1687. His work was part of a one-generation shift in worldview that transformed European thinking. This era was the beginning of both rationalism and roman- ticism, the eighteenth century’s incarnation of two sides of autono- mous man’s thinking: rationalism and irrationalism. 65 In philosophy, the reaction was pantheism, especially in the works of Spinoza, In Trinitarian religion, a dual reaction was evi- dent within a decade of Newton’s death: the rise of Arminian Meth- odism in England and the revivalism of the Great Awakening in the colonies.

Margaret Jacob’s Radical Enlightenment is clear about the spread of pantheistic versions of Newtonianism into France through the Netherlands and Freemasonry. With it came a proclivity for the old neoplatonic Ren- aissance view of man and society. This view is analogous to alchemy’s view of man. They both begin with the presupposition of magic and hermeticism: “AS above, so below.”sl There is an ontologi- cal relationship between man and the cosmos, a chain of being. Molnar put is this way: “. . . it means that there is an absolute al- though hidden concordance between the lower and the higher worlds, the key of which lends to the magus incalculable powers.”s 2 Thus, by manipulating the cosmos, the initiate can change the nature of man (e. g., environmental determinism).

The virtue of the alchemist is crucial to the outcome of the experiment 87 – a radically different conception from modern chemistry. Alchemical literature is filled with the theme of death and rebirth. 88 Man is viewed as co-creator with God. sg The alchemist’s procedures are seemingly similar to, yet radically different from, the chemist’s procedures. He mixes his chemicals in exactly the same way, again and again, waiting for a transformation. The chemist, in contrast, alters his procedure slightly if the experi- mental results repeatedly do not conform to his hypothesis. The main difference procedurally between alchemy and chemistry is in the techniques of cause and effect. The chemist publicly verifies the validity of his experiment by specifying the conditions under which he conducted the experiment, so that others can duplicate the exper- iment’s results. The alchemist, on the contrary, seeks to keep his pro- cedures secret, as Newton did, and he expects most of these repeti- tions to produce no change. Then, after many attempts, after an un- specified series of repetitions of the mixing of the elements, there will be a discontinuous leap of being. The alchemist transcends himself, symbolized and verified by the transformation of the elements. This view of man and change has inevitable social implications. The alchemist sees himself as the first man of a new race, the repre- sentative in the present of a new people. It is an elitist view of social transformation. Rushdoony’s summary is correct: “The purpose of the alchemist was to create the conditions of chaos in order to further the leap ahead in evolution. It is not at all surprising, therefore, that in the Enlightenment alchemists were closely allied to and central to the forces of revolution. Revolution is simply the theo~ of social alchemy.”go 85.

Rationalism and Irrationalism It was the rigid mathematical rationalism of the official Newtonian faith which led, step by step, to the bloody irrationalism of eighteenth- century French rationalism. The French Revolution was the culmi- nation of this Enlightenment dualism between the rational and the irrational. The French Revolution was prepared by a seven-decade intellectual assault on the Christian religion and its institutions, but it was triggered by the King% fiscal crisis in 1788, the year of the rati- fication of the U.S. Constitution. The King had to call the estates- general– not called in a century and a half— to authorize new taxes. This fiscal crisis was a visible sign of his weakness. This bourgeois assembly rapidly escalated its demands to the proclamation of the rights of man. It peaked with the reign of the lawyersgl by means of Dr. Guillotines remarkably efficient technology. The Terror was the political application of the doctrine of the necessity of human sacri- fice as a means of regenerating sin-filled society, i.e., the religion of revolution. (That legacy is with us still in Marxism. )92 The revolu- tionary process ended in a military dictatorship. While it is true, as Margaret Jacob demonstrates, that there were two versions of Newtonianism — the official, Anglican, hierarchical providential Newtonianism, and the mystical, pantheistic, repub- lican, and ultimately revolutionary Newtonianism – her rational/ irrational division is cut too sharply between the Moderate Whigs and the Radical Whigs.

However, Newton’s supposed mere flirtation with alchemy points to a very different conclusion. The official, publicized side of his scientific system was rationalist in the transcendent, Deistic sense, but there was a “dark and troubled” side of his own beliefs and practices that led him back into experiments that had originally been grounded in the pantheism of Renaissance neoplatonism. Newton’s system was not intellectually self-sustaining on the basis of its formal scientific categories. Newton had to appeal to a providential, transcendent god, which he publicly identified with the God of the Bible, in order to sustain his system metaphysically. But it was equally easy for the pantheists of the radical Enlightenment to appeal to a god inherent in nature. Such an appeal was an intellec- tual necessity. “Absolutely central to the Radical Enlightenment ,“ Jacob writes, “is the search for the philosophical foundations of a new religion.”93 Finally, the debate ceased after 1859; Darwinism made the hypothesis of any god unnecessary — an appendage with no further scientific usefulness. Because Christians in the late seven- teenth century had tied their defense of Christianity to Newton’s natural theology, Darwin successfully destroyed this “foundation of Christianit y. 94 Providentialism Newton was a providentialist. He believed in God’s creation of the universe out of nothing, its inevitable running down, and the need for God occasionally to intervene in nature to keep the cosmic clock running in good order.g5 In his General Scholium, which he added to Part III of the Principia – “The System of the World” – in 1713, a quarter century after the Principia first appeared, he insists that “The six primary planets are revolved about th’e sun in circles concentric with the sun. . . . “96 Notice his use of the passive voice: are reuolued. 93.

The laws of nature are imposed laws, not inherent in nature, as it was in the Stoic conception of the laws of nature. ’ 00 This is what links Newtonianism to the nominalism of William of Ockham, who also grounded natural law on the will of God. 101 This is the vohmtarist tra- dition, the tradition of contractualism. On first glance, it is close to Puritan covenantalism — the “ordinary providence of God’’1°2 – but it is surely Cartesian. 103 What must be understood is that Newton’s system of natural causation is Deistic. It demands belief in an inherently impersonal God who reveals Himself only in nature. This God can be known only through His attributes in nature; there is no mention of His revelation in Scripture. ‘We know him only by his most wise and ex- cellent contrivances of things, and final causes; we admire him for his perfections; but we reverence and adore him on account of his dominion: for we adore him as his servants; and a god without do- minion, providence, and final causes, is nothing else but Fate and Nature .”1°4 Metaphysical Architecture This Newtonian god exercises dominion, but his system gives us no warrant for believing that men can know him ethically through written revelation; we can only know him metaphysically and in- 97.

Geometry was seen as the common language among men. “If God was to be discerned in the creation at all,” write Baigent and Leigh, “it was not in the multipli- city of forms, but in the unifying principles running through those forms and underlying them. In other words, God was to be dis- cerned in the principles of shape — determined ultimately by the degrees in an angle – and by number. It was through shape and number, not by representation of diverse forms, that God’s glory was held to be manifest. And it was in edifices based on shape and num- ber, rather than on representational embellishment, that the divine presence was to be housed. ~ 105 This is one reason why Newton was so fascinated with the dimensions of the Temple built by Solomon. 106 The Temple was seen as a metaphysical representation of God’s cosmos, not as the place where the tablets of the law of God resided in the Ark of the Covenant, and where His glory cloud resided. The Temple was seen more as a talisman than as a place of ethical worship. 107 The origins of this geometrical religion can be traced back to the ancient world. It was kept alive in the West by both rabbinic Judaism and Islam: The synthesis of shape and number is, of course, geometry. Through geometry, and the regular recurrence of geometric patterns, the synthesis of shape and number is actualized. Through the study of geometry, therefore, certain absolute laws appeared to become legible — laws which attested to an underlying order, an underlying design, an underlying coherence. This master plan was apparently infallible, immutable, omnipresent; and by vir- tue of those very qualities, it could be construed, easily enough, as some- thing of divine origin — a visible manifestation of the divine power, the divine will, the divine craftsmanship. And thus geometry, in both Judaism and Islam, came to assume sacred proportions, becoming invested with a character of transcendent and immanent mystery. 108 The Roman architect Vitruvius recommended the establishment of collegia of builders. “Let the altars look to the east; he said. 109 The 105.

For was not architecture the supreme application and actualization of geometry. . . . Was it not in architecture that geometry in effect became incarnate?” 110 (That Roman architecture has dominated government buildings in the U.S. and in Europe is no accident.) “It was thus in structures based on geometry, with no embellishment to distract or deflect the mind, that God’s presence was to be accommodated and worshiped. The synagogue and the mosque, therefore, were both based not on deco- ration, but on geometric principles, on abstract mathematical rela- tionships. And the only ornamentation allowed in them was of an abstract geometrical kind — the maze, for example, the arabesque, the chessboard, the arch, the pillar or column and other such ‘pure’ embodiments of symmetry, regularity, balance and proportion .“ 1 i 1 There was a revival of scholarly interest in Vitruvius during the Renaissance. 112 This vision of the architect as magus goes back to Plato’s Timaeus (53c to 62c). The creator god is equated with the Architect of the Universe. The tekton is the craftsman; the arche-teckton is the master craftsman. This arche-tekton created the universe by means of geom- et. v .113 There is littIe doubt that geometry, and specifically Pythagorean geometry, was basic to Plato’s teachings. Philosopher Karl Popper has identified Plato as the founder of the geometrical theory of the world. 114 While the designer of the Cheeps pyramid seems to possess a better claim on this title, 115 surely Plato has been the more influen- tial historically. He saw the mastery of geometry as fundamental to the philosopher-king’s creation of a politically centralized social or- der and his control over the affairs of mankind. So have his spiritual heirs.

The stonemasons were one such fraternity. Here were the seeds of the later “speculative” Freemasonry. 116 This Newtonian impulse is basic to understanding the close asso- ciation of Newton’s followers in the Royal Society and the spread of reconstituted Freemasonry after 1717. Freemasonry worshiped geometry, even as the Principia had relied on geometry to prove its case. There was another aspect of this theology of geometry: the search for God in history. God’s transcendence was manifested by geometry, but this was not sufficient; God had to make Himself manifest to man. Again, geometry was the key. This was the reason for the fascination with Solomon’s Temple. Write Baigent and Leigh: Within this ‘esoteric’ tradition of ‘initiated’ masters, sacred geometry was of paramount importance — a manifestation, as we have seen, of the divine. For such masters, a cathedral was more than a ‘house of God’. It was something akin to a musical instrument, an instrument tuned to a par- ticular and exalted spiritual pitch, like a harp. If the instrument were tuned correctly, God Himself would resonate through it, and His immanence would be felt by all who entered. But how did one tune it correctly? How and where did God specify His design requirements? Sacred geometry pro- vided the general principles, the underlying laws. 117 Geometry was not enough. Music was not enough. There must be intellectual content to this immanence. There must be ethical content, including the assurance of personal salvation, itself defined as presence with God in eternity. This is what scientific Newtonian- ism could not provide. The creation of ‘speculative Freemasonry — a guild open to men without any connection to stonemasonry – was a major theological and institutional attempt to provide this assur- ance, but within the geometrical worldview of Newtonian science.

The Newtonian system, being Unitarian-Socinian 118 theologi- cally and mathematical epistemologically, left mankind without a personal, covenantal God who intervenes in history in order to meet the needs of mankind. At best, He intervenes to meet the needs of a disjointed universe. This Newtonian god really was the distant, transcendent god of older high school textbook accounts of Deism. There was insufficient presence of this Newtonian god with his peo- ple. He was all system and no sanctions. The quest for an immanent god led a segment of the Newtonian movement back into pantheism’s mystical paths. Any segment of Newtonianism that did not go down these paths eventually headed out to the far shore of atheism. Newton’s god of gravity – influence at a distance but without physi- cal connection — was too little for the pantheists and too much for the atheists. 1 ‘g This god of gravity became even too much for Newton to bear as time went on. Like a dog returning to its vomit, in the second edition of Opticks (1717), he once again returned to his experimentally unten- able theory of the “ether” that fills all intermediary spaces. He had to find a physical means of explaining attraction at a distance. 120 He had offered this theory in an early paper to the Royal Society (1675), a paper which had been cogently attacked by Robert Hooke. ~z 1 Newton had defended this ethereal theory in Book IV of the 1693 manuscript Opticks, but his experiments later concluded that the ex- 118.

He capitulated in 1717, however, disinterring it from its resting place in the quiet graveyard of unveri- fiable hypotheses, thereby converting his system into what could later stand alone as a purely mechanistic theory. 122 Christiansen calls this problem of the ether Newton’s “thirty-year nightmare .“ 123 Friction in this hypothetical ethereal universe made it necessary for Newton to hypothesize the need for God to intervene periodically to restore this insufficiently harmonious system to full harmony. 124 Burtt describes this view of God: the cosmic plumber. 125 Newton could have concluded instead that the universe would simply run down over time, but this “entropic” worldview did not appear until the mid-nineteenth-century. 126 That was the price of pure mate- rialism, which Samuel Clarke had predicted would lead to atheism in his “Final Reply,” 127 a price the nineteenth century atheists will- ingly paid.

They did not want a revival of Giordano Bruno’s magic or his speculations regard- ing a world soul. Nevertheless, pantheism could not be successfully overcome by the Newtonian moderate Whigs, given the reality of Newton’s heavy Socinian emphasis on the absolute transcendence of God. The unsolved theological problem for Newton was immanence. Where is God’s Personal presence in this world? The Puritans possessed a consistent answer to this problem based on the doctrine of the Trinity. First and foremost, God is transcendently in control of all things — the doctrine of covenantal providence. 130 This same God is also present with His people in the Person of the Holy Spirit, who dwells in the hearts of regenerate men and who en- ables both regenerate and unregenerate to perform good works. 13 i He gives His people new hearts. “Those who are once effectually called, and regenerated, having a new heart, and a new spirit created in them, are further sanctified, really and personally, through the virtue of Christ’s death and resurrection, by His Word and Spirit dwelling in them: . . . “ 132 God interacts with mankind in history, for He had been a man in history, and in His perfect manhood, He now sits at the right hand of God the Father (Mark 16:3). 133 God is pres- ent representatively in the Bible, the revealed Word of God in his- tory, and also in His Church. In contrast to the Puritans’ concept of cosmic personali.rm stands Newton’s cosmic impersonalism. His was a halfway covenant cos- mology: relying on the intellectual residue of Puritanism, he denied the power thereof. Newton was not a Trinitarian. His cosmology did not allow for much interaction between God and man, and even his peers resented his discussion of God’s cosmic interventions to shore up the rusting clock. 134 129.

Pantheism simply made this implicit ir- rationalism more visible to a handful of Masonic initiates; Newton’s Socinian providentialism ultimately contained the seeds of its own destruction. It could not resolve the problem of the one and the many, structure and change, mathematics and matter. It could not explain why mathematics, an artful creation of man’s intellect, should have such a close correlation with the operations of the exter- nal world.

This did not mean that pantheists were irrelevant to events; it just meant that they were not open in their intellectual defenses of the system. .Jacob’s studies indicate that mechanistic pantheism spread fro-m England to the Netherlands and from there into France. 137 On the Continent, this became part of the occult underground that eventually produced the French Revolution.

Men seldom recognize the fact that Van Til observed through- out his career: there is a secret treaty between rationalists and irration- alists against the God of the Bible. 141 Or as he said more graphically, they support themselves by taking in each other’s washing. Newtonianism for Christian Intellectuals Reventlow’s summary of the impact of Newtonian thought is crucially important in understanding the nature of eighteenth- century science, religion, and social theory: In practice, in the long run the Newtonians only played into the hands of the Deists, against whom they wanted to fight, and the Atheists (who at that time were more a chimaera than a real danger, though their time came in the second half of the century). The Arianism widespread among them (which was accepted e.g. by Newton himself, [Samuel] Clarke, and most naturally by [William] Whiston) is an indubitable sign that the view of God held by these people was primarily oriented on the ‘book of his works’. Above all, however, moralistic ethics, already a living legacy of humanistic theology, gained an additional foundation in the ‘new philosophy’, which made it increasingly independent of the Bible and thus more and more independent of theology generally. 142 Richard Westfall is even more specific: “Natural religion was sup- posed to be the sure defender. Yet in the end the defender turned out to be the enemy in the gates.”143 None of this was suspected by the literate Christian public in the early eighteenth century. Surely it was not suspected by the Rev. Cotton Mather, whose A Christian Philosopher (1721) is a long tract praising Newton’s system. It was not suspected by John Wither- spoon when he began his first lecture on moral philosophy in 1768: 140.

Eventually all progressive European Christians, from the German philosopher Leibniz to the Cartesian priest Melabranche, would be forced to restructure the philosophical foundations of Christianity to conform to one or another version of the new science. It is hardly surpris- ing that liberal Anglicanism, wedded as it was by the 1690s to Newtonian science, took the lead in this enterprise.’5 1 Earlier, she had written: “The linkage they forged between liberal Protestantism and early Newtonianism was never entirely broken during the eighteenth century. . . . The latitudinarian proponents of early Newtonianism had succeeded in resting their social ideology on the model provided by the Newtonian universe.” 152 There is great irony here, she says, given the humanistic society that emerged as a result of their worldview. “The society that the latitudinarians wished to create was to be Christian and godly in the biblical sense of those terms. Their vision of history had been conditioned by the Reforma- tion, and they believed themselves to be preparing Englishmen for the millennial paradise.”i5s These were not strictly Enlightenment men; they were transitional figures, 1680-1720.’54 As time passed, the differences separating liberal Anglicans from the Whig Commonwealthmen became political rather than theologi- cal.

Russell Kirk’s summary of Deism is ac- curate: “Deism was neither a Christian schism nor a systematic phi- losophy, but rather a way of looking at the human condition; the men called Deists differed among themselves on many points. (Thomas Paine often was called an atheist, but is more accurately described as a rather radical Deist.) Deism was an outgrowth of 151. Jacob, Cultural Meaning of the Scient@c Revolution, p. 111. 152.

The Deists professed belief in a single Supreme Being, but rejected a large part of Christian doctrine. Follow Nature, said the Deists (as the Stoics had said before them), not Revelation: all things must be tested by private rational judgment. The Deists relied especially upon mathematical approaches to reality, influenced in this by the thought of Sir Isaac Newton.” 155 The Deistic implications of the Newtonian system were first fully developed by the third Earl of Shaftesbury in his multi-volume Char- mteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times (6th edition, 1738). He was the grandson of the enormously popular Whig opponent of Charles II and James II and defender of Parliamentary rights. 156 The grand- son was a close friend of John Locke; he regarded himself as Locke’s friend and foster-son, 157 but he abandoned his Lockeanism late in life and returned to faith in Greek philosophy, especially Xenophon. ~sB (It was Xenophon who was assigned by president John Witherspoon to the sophomore class at the College of New Jersey.) 159 Shaftesbury set the tone of the age of mild (non-revolutionary) skepticism regard- ing Christianity. He rejected the Bible as a source of ethics, preached a god subordinate to independent ethical principles, and relied on Newton’s worldview to defend his system. The Bible in the late seventeenth century, even in the liberal Protestant camp, was a prin- ciple of formal authority. Not so with the Deists. Beginning with Shaftesbury, they proclaimed the autonomy of ethics. Shaftesbury, says Reventlow, connected ethics “with the idea of a harmony within the world as established by Newton,” and then “he showed that the revel- ation contained in the Bible and handed down by historical tradition could be dispensed with. ~ 160 Men could henceforth rely on reason and tradition to achieve their goals.

Christian historians have adopted three approaches to these questions: first, ignore the fact that the Constitution is Deistic (the strategy of self-deception); second, argue that the religious pre- suppositions of the Constitution can be equally agreed to by Desists, Christians, and just about every other rational person of good will “ (the strategy of common-ground philosophy); third, argue that the Constitution is essentially Christian, but Deists, by the grace of God, not only can accept it, but they actually wrote it “God’s way (the strategy of providential schizophrenia). 1 ‘z The second strategy seems most common today. Christian stu- dents of the Constitution insist that the Constitution is in conformity with commonly shared judicial principles, on the implicit or explicit as- sumption of the validity of some version of natural law theory. They begin with the misleading presupposition of the commonality of “2 + 2 = 4,” just as the Framers did, and from this they conclude that political polytheism is valid. It does not even occur to them that the phrase “2 + 2 = 4“ does not mean the same thing in a Christian theory of God-created reality as it does in a non-Ch~istian theory of evolution- ary reality. It does not occur to them that without the presupposition of the Trinitarian God of the Bible, it takes a gigantic leap of faith to conclude that “2 + 2 = 4.”163 They still think in terms of eighteenth- century Newtonianism rather than either six-day creationism or modern quantum physics and chaos theory.

Almost everyone accepted this worldview in the eighteenth century.

This was a transi- tional concept of God. 166 Hume’s skepticism undermined faith in this Tory god from man’s perspective, and advancing science sys- tematically found ways of removing the need for this god by finding ways of autonomously shoring up nature’s friction-bound autono- mous order. Nevertheless, the idea of an orderly system of nature under the rule of mathematics remained (and remains) a powerful ~ motivating idea for men in their quest to master nature — including man’s own nature and society — by means of rigorous investigation and the application of practical science to the environment. Like the doctrine of predestination, faith in which supposedly should make fatalists and passivists out of Calvinists, who subsequently turn out to be a dynamic social force, so was Newtonian mathematical law. It delivered practical knowledge to man, and in doing so, offered him the possibility of dominion and power. What was needed to infuse Newtonianism with power was a new dynamic. What was needed was a view of the possibility of man’s ethical transformation, which could then produce social transforma- tion. What was needed was a doctrine of the new man. Rousseau pro- vided one version of this doctrine of human transformation; the American revivalists provided another. Both views rested on a doc- trine of man as being more than — transcendent to — the mechanical laws of matter in motion. Both views therefore rested on a program of personal and social change that was beyond the boundaries of reason. The Great Awakening The shift from rationalism to emotionalism in the life of colonial America can best be seen in the writings of Jonathan Edwards. He began with his youthful speculations on science: U. . . it is self-evident I believe to every man, that Space is necessary, eternal, infinite and omnipresent. But I had as good speak plain: I have already said as much as, that Space is God. And it is indeed clear to me, that all the Space there is, not proper to the body, all the Space there is without the bounds of Creation, all the Space there was before the Creation, is God himselfi . . . ’169 Yet he was to write that lengthy defense of “sweet” emotionalism, the Peatise Concerning the Religious Afections 168.

Ren6 Descartes was the intellectual godfather of the youthful Edwards – God as Space was clearly not Newtonian – but Newton was surely the intellectual godfather of the Edwards of the Great Awakening. Men needed confidence that God’s millennial judgments on the world would not melt the predictable order of the universe. Newtonianism gave them this confidence. Men needed assurance that in abandoning the “legalism” of the older covenantal Puritanism that there would be something to replace the shattered civil foundations. Lockeanism and its derivatives gave them this assurance. “At the heart of the evangelical ethic,” write Heimert and Miller, two master historians of the era, “was the hope of human bet- terment, the vision of a community in which men, instinctively as it were, would seek the general welfare. ~ lTO But Calvinists knew better: in a world in which men are totally depraved, it takes more than in- stinct to persuade men to seek the common welfare. It takes civil law to restrain them. But the eighteenth-century Christians had no spe- cific system of civil law to recommend in the name of God. So, they recommended other law-orders and other sources than the Old Tes- tament. (Conditions have not changed since then, either.) Experience vs. Creeds The heart of the theological problem with the Great Awakening was its abandonment of the biblical doctrine of the covenant. This led to an institutional crisis. When push came to shove, the pro- ponents of the Great Awakening wanted a new Christian commu- nity based on warm, fuzzy feelings rather than creedal orthodoxy. They wanted emotionalism. The halfway covenant theology of New England was a complex theological invention to deal with the unfore- seen outcome of requiring a prospective church member to relate his experience of conversion as one basis of acceptance into the church. Halfway covenant theology was abandoned by the revivalists be- cause they abandoned Puritan covenant theology altogether. They decided to abandon any test other than the conversion experience as the ultimate standard of church fellowship. Every other test was sec- ondary, at least in actual practice. The experience of ecstatic rapture steadily replaced the historic creeds of the Church as the basis of 170.

This opened the door to Armin- ianism and then, when the fires cooled, to Deism and rationalism. It established “hot gospelling” as the basis of evangelism. The least- common-denominator principle took hold, until people fell to their knees and barked like dogs for Jesus. In the next century, “Old School” Calvinist Charles Hedge referred to this as “the leaven of en- thusiasm.” As he said, such outbursts were opposed by Jonathan Edwards, the Boston clergy, by Gilbert Tennent, and others (though initially, not by George Whitefield). 171 Hedge defended the Presby- terian Church’s disciplinary structure and its essentially judicial, covenantal theology in opposing such antinomian outbursts of re- vivalism. Hedge spoke for the orthodox, hierarchical Church” of all ages against antinomian lawlessness when he wrote: Those under its influence pretended to a power of discerning spirits, of deciding at once who was and who was not converted; they professed a per- fect assurance of the favour of God, founded not upon scriptural evidence, but inward suggestion. It is plain that when men thus give themselves up to the guidance of secret impressions, and attribute divine authority to sug- gestions, impulses, and casual occurrences, there is no extreme of error or folly to which they may not be led. They are beyond the control of reason or the word of God. 172 He clearly had in mind Presbyterian revivalist Gilbert Tennent, a founder of the Log College, which became the College of New Jersey, and finally became Princeton College in the late nineteenth century, who wrote The Danger of an Unconverted Minist~ (1741). He accused his creed-proclaiming, jurisdiction-protecting fellow Pres- byterians of being reprobates and “Old Pharisee-Teachers. ”173 They had “exerted the Craft of Foxes,” and had displayed “the Cruelty of Wolves .”174 “The old Pharisees, for all their long Prayers and other 171.

It is also self-consciously anticlerical. This anticlericalism was a common outlook among the itinerant preachers, many of them unordained men, who willfully invaded the territories of local churches through- out the colonies, justifying this challenge to local church authority on the pretence that the local pastors had failed to preach a pure gospel. Worse, as Tennent’s tirade shows, they accused pastors of not being converted men. They made few attempts to bring formal charges against these supposed apostate pastors in their respective denomi- nations; the y simply conducted nondenominational, non-worship public meetings in the local communities. The anticlericalism, anti- denominationalism, and anti-creedalism of the Great Awakening became progressively more self-conscious as the movement spread intermittently across the colonies for more than two decades. The problem, Hedge said a century later, was that They paid more attention to inward impressions than on the word of God.” lTs The individualistic inwardness led to an institutional inclusivism based on experience rather than the Bible, creeds, and Church sanc- tions. They screened their ranks in terms of outward signs of en- thusiam rather than profession of faith. “If an honest man doubted his conversion, he was declared unconverted. If any one was filled with great joy, he was pronounced a child of God. . . . If they did not feel a minister’s preaching, they maintained he was unconverted, or legal.’’179 Or legal.

This analysis was made a century later by a critic, but Hedge’s criticism was based on his knowledge of the historical sources within the de- nomination, such as minutes of the presbyteries, and on his knowledge of other historical studies of the era. He understood the revivalists’ assault on the Church. Tennent was ejected from the denomination in 1741. The emo- tionalists and the creedalists (nationalists,” as their opponents called them) could tolerate communion no longer; the Presbyterian Church split in 1741: Philadelphia Synod (Old Side) and New York Synod (New Side). The New Side (semi-creedalists) and the Old Side (rigorous creedalists) did not reunite until 1758, and the result was the erosion of creedalism, culminating in the revision of the Westminster Confession in 1787. (A parallel split [1838] and reunion [1869] took place in the next century– New School vs. Old School– with the same long-term result: the spread of semi-creedalism after 1870, the rise of Arminianism after 1893, the triumph of liberalism in 1925, the expulsion of the Calvinists in 1936, and the complete revi- sion of the creed in 1967.) What happened to the Presbyterians dur- ing the Great Awakening was repeated in Congregationalism (Old Lights vs. New Lights). 180 Tennent was not alone. Heimert has noted Edwards’ rationalistic aesthetics: ‘Edwards turned to nature, not for refuge from the still, sad music of humanity, but because he believed that God had devised a world of natural beauty — where ‘one thing sweetly harmonizes with another.’. . . ~lel That view was widely shared in the colonies. Indeed, even Voltaire would have agreed. Where did Edwards get such an idea? From Newton, the master theologian of not quite per- fectly harmonious nature. What Newtonianism did for American civil polity, experientialism eventually did for American ecclesiasti- cal polity: create a new judicial basis for communion and confedera- tion. Unitarian rationalism and non-creedal Christian irrationalism joined forces in the second half of the eighteenth century, and the result was a new nation, conceived in neutrality, and dedicated to the proposition that all church creeds are created equal. 180.

If the added requirement is experience, then someone in the church will not meet this inherently undefinable standard. If experience becomes in any way a formal basis of membership, detailed creeds will then be seen as inherently divisive within the church, and the defenders of such creeds will be seen as narrow bigots. The supplemental standard will become the primary screening device in the eyes of those who believe that it is more than supplemental. This is what happened during the Great Awakening and its aftermath in the 1760’s. The Great Awak- ening restructured Church government as surely as it restructured civil government. 182 Samuel Davies, a leader in Virginia Presbyterian circles and who succeeded Jonathan Edwards as president of the College of New Jersey, began in the late 1750’s to urge a “uni~ of a~ection and design” among all of Virginia’s dissenters, Baptists and Presbyterians. He argued that this unity would not be based on doctrine or logic, but on “experimental and practical Religion.” 183 In the revival of 1763, this was the basis of another call to Christian union; Christians were to be “one in heart, one in affection” in attending to “the same great con- cern ,“ which was the Work of Redemption. 184 Contrary to Heimert’s assertion that “the essentials of Calvinism” were “the New Birth and experimental religion, ~ 1*S there was nothing explicitly or even im - plicitly Calvinistic about these concerns. There was clearly nothing Puritan. The Great Awakening was creating a new basis of Christian unit y: experientialism and a least-common-denominator creedalism. This unity could not be maintained ecclesiastically. Baptists were Baptists; Presbyterians were Presbyterians (and separated from their brethren until 1758). Where, then, was this hoped-for unity to be manifested? In civic religion. This would requir~ a common “view of civil law to match the ever-leaner creedal confessions and the ever- less covenantal conception of Christian society. This was reflected in the Presbyterians’ steady acceptance of a practice they had never been comfortable with, public fast days. These days were a celebra- tion of God’s common moral law among nations: 182. See Bushman, From Puritan to Yankee. 183. Cited in Heimert, Religion, p. 142. 184. Idem. 185.

By the late years of the Revolution Calvinists were urging thanksgivings in terms of “the common laws of society” that obliged all men to join in expressions of gratitude for the felicity of “communities, as collective bodies .“. . . Over the course of thirty years they had moved from a disenchantment with the course of colonial history to a celebration of the fact that the saints, having engaged themselves in political tiairs, had seemingly succeeded in imposing their moral law on American society. 1s6 On the contrary, the Unitarians had imposed their view of the revelation-free moral law on the Calvinists and everyone else. The non-creedal Great Awakening, followed by the national spirit of the Revolution against a common political enemy, had destroyed all traces of the Puritan holy commonwealth ideal. It had virtually de- stroyed its original internationalism — the city on a hill — and had seriously damaged its civil localism. Common-ground, minimal- creed religious experientialism had combined with common-ground Newtonian rationalism to produce the national civil religion. There was a spirit of rebellion at the heart of the Great Awaken- ing: against Church authority and against State authority. It tore up the churches and it tore up the last remnant of the Trinitarian holy commonwealth ideal in New England. The individualists had organ- ized against the particularism of the creeds. It unleashed the same forces that the revolution in England had unleashed a century earlier. This time, however, the wave of anti-creedalism could not be stopped, short of the restructuring of civil government in New England. The spirit of Spirit-filled individualism — so similar in effects to the spirit of pantheistic autonomy — coupled with the inevitable quest for some basis of fellowship outside the organized churches, even if this period lasted only for a year or two in a man’s life, transformed men’s think- ing. They were never again willing to fight for Trinitarian oaths as the foundation of citizenship. The Great Awakening’s one-generation spirit of rebellion washed away the biblical covena~t ideal along with the last political remnants of that ideal. It has yet to be restored. 1s7 186.

But what kind of order would this new order be? It would not be Chris- tian. There is no doubt that after the Revolution, the focus of the civil government became one of protecting individual liberty rather than protecting Christian society (e. g., sexual morality), even in once-Puritan Massachusetts. 193 Michael Lienesch’s superb summary of the Framers’ outlook demonstrates that they held a “modern” view of politics – a view of politics analogous to Newtonian astronomy. While they referred to Roman history, their minds were governed by a very different para- digm, especially when they sought to defend the work of the Consti- tutional Convention. The following extract from Lienesch’s book must be read carefully. With this new form of political science, Federalists sought to create a timeless form of politics. Transcending any need for the lessons of the past, preventing any possibility of declension in the future, the American Consti- tution existed entirely in a theoretically perfect present. The discoveries of modern science had made it possible to bring the principles of the political realm into complete conformity with the laws of the natural world. Written in “the language of reason and truth,” based on principles “as fixed and un- changeable as the laws which operate in the natural world,” the Constitu- 191.

With it, predicted an admiring Robert Davidson, the American states “shaJl resem- ble, the Solar System, where every obedient planet moves on its proper path, — never seeking to fly from, nor even approaching the great attractive orb, than the wise author of nature intended.” 196 The federal Constitution was created to apply equally to every age, never running down, wearing out, or falling into disrepair. As far as these Federalist writers were con- cerned, the new republic could continue in this perfect state forever — “a system: Barlow rhapsodized, “which will stand the test of ages.” 197 Throughout the debates, Federalists would continue to argue that the Constitution was a theoretically perfect instrument. As the state conven- tions drew on, however, they came to admit the cold hard truth so often propounded by the Antifederalists – that the Constitution, however excel- lent in theory, might well be flawed in practice. Equally important, they re- alized that the case for ratification could be strengthened by embracing the Antifederalist demand for an amendment procedure. Thus, in Federalist rhetoric, “experience” began to undergo one final change, from experience as scientific truth to experience as scientific experimentation. 198 This appeal to experience was no deviation from Newtonianism. Newton had admitted that God must occasionally reimpose His will on a declining, friction-bound cosmic order. The universe is not a perfect auton~mous cosmic clock. Thus, the revised view of those who defended this “modern” view of the Constitution was really con- sistent with Newtonianism. Lienesch does not make this clear in his 194.

He does correctly point out that eighteenth-century science accepted a dual view of science: theoretical permanence and practi- cal improvement. 199 A Familiar Stov This dualism between theoretical permanence and historical change is equally true of every philosophical system. There has to be a system of permanence which undergirds and gives meaning to all change — if nothing else, then at least a communications system based on grammar (fixed rules, yet with allowance for change through usage). With regularity there had to be a way to deal with human ex- perience. The Framers were well aware of this dilemma, and they devoted considerable time and effort to studying the experience of political orders in the past, especially classical poiitics. This was also a heritage of the Whig tradition. ZOIJ This dilemma is the continuation of the ancient philosophical problem of law vs. flux, logic vs. history, or as Van Til liked to put it, the static ice block philosophy of Parmenides vs. the fluctuating flowing river of Heraclitus. It is the fundamental antinomy of all hu- manist thought. Plato tried to reconcile the two, Van Til said, but failed. “Plato could not stop his ice cubes from becoming water un- less he would freeze all the water into ice.’’zol This dualism between law and historical change cannot be reconciled apart from the doc- trines of the Trinity, the creation out of nothing, and God’s absolute providence over history in terms of His sovereign decree and plan.

There was no Constitutional solution to the problems of political philosophy in either Federalist Whig Newtonian re- publicanism or Antifederalist Whig Newtonian republicanism. The sought-for Constitutional balance of the one and the many, apart from the Bible and the Old Testament case laws, is unattainable. Like Newton’s universe. apart from God’s constant, active provi- dence, the ‘balanced Constitution” will inevitably move toward cen- tralized tyranny (the fear of the Antifederalists) or toward dissolu- tion (the fear of the Federalists). Both movements took place in 1861-65. The centralists won the intellectual battle of political phi- losophy on the military battlefields of the U.S. Civil War.

And this order would be judicially non-Christian. These men saw themselves as architects of a new nation and a new order of the ages: Novu.s Ordo Seclorum. This identification with architecture was not a random development. Constitution-building was, in their minds, analogous to the work of a Great Architect. It was a new creation. It was a break from the past — a specifically Christian past. Yet there was a sufficient legacy from that past, in- cluding a millennial aspect, 209 to persuade them that such an experi- ment would succeed. To make possible this hypothetically disinterested examination of politics, the Constitution removed Christian religious tests as the judi- cial requirement of the judges and officers of the new national govern- ment. That, in and of itself, delivered the republic into the hands of the humanists. Nothing else was necessary after that. From that point on, the secularization of America was a mopping-up operation.

Yet in his Nouus Ordo Seclorum: The Intellectual Origins of the Constitution (1985), he mentions Isaac Newton only once, and then only in a list of names of people cited in one colonial oration. 221 McDonald goes into great detail, as my teacher Douglass Adair used to do, regarding the influ- ence of Coke, Bolingbroke, Monstesquieu, Hume, Blackstone, Locke, Grotius, Vattel, and dozens of other long-forgotten figures. Yet the towering intellectual figure of the age – indeed, the towering intellectual figure of the modern world, whose Principia dates the ad- vent of this world — the man who set the foundational paradigm of all modern scientific thought, is not even discussed. (Adair was equally guilty of this neglect.) It was Isaac Newton who more than any other figure made possible the culture-wide ideological shift of the West from Trinitarianism to Deism, and from thence to atheism. It was Isaac Newton who, in his meticulous, geometrical, guarded way, turned the world upside down — ether or no ether. 219.

He ignores the source of the modern West’s paradigm shift — Isaac Newton — and concen- trates instead on its diligent developers in the limited field of political theory. He does not discuss the origin of the politics of the 1780’s ~ in the laboratories of the 1680’s.

When the Invisi- ble College became visible, the revolution was. 222 Conclusion McDonald’s neglect of Newton is matched by his far less well- informed equivalents in the Christian academic community. For well over a century, a handful of Christian conservatives have at- tempted to place the American Revolution within the context of Christian thought and culture, despite the steady expiration of both explicitly Christian thought (moral casuistry) and culture in the early eighteenth century. This approach can be somewhat successful with respect to certain intellectual defenses of the American Revolution itself, especially by an appeal to patriotic sermons, though not with- out considerable qualification and a clear recognition of the crippling effects of Newtonian natural law philosophy on the defenses of the best Christian political apologists. 223 On the other hand, such an at- tempt is utterly fruitless with respect to the ideological origins of the U.S. Constitution. Nell, Hatch, and Marsden recognize this, and they have successfully defeated their traditional conservative Chris- tian rivals in the field of intellectual battle. Their political ideal is Newtonian, and they can demonstrate that their preference is incar- nated in the Constitutional settlement.

Roger Williams secularized this position, and universalized it by means of natural law theory. This is the theological foundation of modern political polytheism.

His dominant role in drafting the Constitution and forcing the First Amendment upon a reluctant Congress in 1789 is well known. In the light of history, it would have been an irony had any other man performed the task – certainly no one in the House of Representatives or Senate could match his record as a fighter for religious freedom. Some thirty years later Madison was still as concerned about the need for separation of church and state as he had been in 1774. Around 1832 he wrote a retrospective memorandum on the scenes of public life he had witnessed and also set down a few of his fears. Among the latter was a feeling that “the danger of silent accumulations /?z encroachments, by Ecclesiastical Bodies have not sufficiently engaged attention in the U. S.”. . . Warming to the issue, Madison called on the errant states to build an impenetrable wall separating the church and state and thus “make the example of your Country as pure & compleat, in what relates to the freedom of the mind and its allegiance to its maker, as in what be- longs to the legitimate objects of political and civil institutions.”. . . With Madison the line between church and state had to be drawn with absolute firmness. ‘The establishment of the chaplain- ship to Congs is a palpable violation of equal rights, as well as of Constitutional principles.” And what about presidential proclama- tions involving religious feast days and fasts? Even though they come as “recommendations only, they imply a religious agency” and are therefore suspect. On balance, Madison reasoned, even these proclamations are not a good idea, and he appears to have regretted those issued during his presidency. “They seem to imply and cer- tainly nourish the erroneous idea of a national religion,” he explained. “During the administration of Mr. Jefferson no religious proclama- tion was issued.” Looking back, Madison wished he had followed the same rule.

Those beneath the oath-taker in the hierarchy are under the covenant’s law- order through the oath-taking representative agent. Until she says “I do,” the woman is not a wife; once she does, she is bound legally to God through her husband and to her husband under God. The same is true in a church. Similarly, when a citizen agrees to remain under the jurisdiction of the civil government, he has implicitly taken an oath to defend it and obey its authorized representatives. The oath invokes negative covenant sanctions; once invoked, there is no escape: “And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the L ORD commanded him. And all the people answered together, and said, All that the L ORD bath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the L ORD ” (Ex. 19:7-8). He was their repre- sentative agent. When they promised to obey, they took an oath for themselves and their posterity. The oath has continuity over genera- tions. So do its stipulations. Only the sovereign who establishes the oath can change the stipulations or the oath. The ability to change the stipulations or the oath is therefore a mark of ultimate sovereignty. With this in mind, we begin our discussion of the U.S. Constitu- tion as a covenant document. A Civil Covenant The U.S. Constitution reveals its covenant structure in its five divisions: Sovereignty: Preamble Law: Legislation (Congress: Article I) Sanctions: Enforcement (Executive: Article II) Hierarchy: Appeals (Judicial: Articles III, IV) Succession: Amendments (Article V) The five points do not appear in the same order that they do in the biblical covenant model, but all five are present. In this sense, the Constitution is surely a covenant document – one that is far more visibly covenantal in structure than is the case in other constitutions.

We have here an echo of classical Roman political philosophy, enunciated by Cicero, who was one of the favorites of the Framers: ZIOX Pofwli, vox dei. The voice of the people is the voice of God. Professor Clark is correct: vox PoPuli, vox dei is a divine-right slogan.4 The divine-right doctrine teaches that no earthly appeal beyond the specified sovereign agent or agency is legitimate. Nothing lawfully separates the authority of the divine-right agency from God. If there is no personal God in the system, then this agency takes the place of God in society. This phrase announces in principle the genius of the people. 5 We should not forget that genius in pre-imperial Rome meant the divinity of the city of Rome and its people (in the Dea Roma cult), and later be- came an attribute of the EmperoFs divinity. G This raises an inescapable problem for politics: Who speaks for the sovereign? In no covenantal system does God speak continually and directly to those under the authority of the covenant. The de- bate in the West until the twentieth century was between those who defended the king or executive branch and those who defended the legislature. It was the question of “the enforcer vs. the declarer.” As I will show later on in this chapter, in twentieth-century America, the locus of final earthly sovereignty has shifted: the judicial branch in the U.S. government has become the sovereign’s exclusive voice, its sole authorized interpreter.

The anti-monarchical Virzdicitse Contra Tyrannis, by “Lucius Junius Brutus,” published in 1579, offered a biblical and covenantal justification for political rebellion. It was translated into English and published in the year following the Glorious Revolution of 1688. This book became a familiar reference during the American Revolu- tion. It asserted the sovereignty of the people above the sovereignty of kings. One of the sections of “The Third Question” announces: ‘The whole body of the people is above the king.”s So common were these ideas among Protestants in the late sixteenth century that even Richard Hooker appealed to the Vindiciae in his Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity (1594) in his defense of the divine right of the kings of England. 9 He said that the representatives of the “people’s majesty” crown the king. 10 The king rules by God through the people. He rules by law, meaning natural law, which is the same as God’s re- vealed law in the Bible. Hooker began his study with a discussion of natural law, which remained the hypothetical law structure that sup- posedly serves autonomous man as a legitimate substitute for bibli- cal law. The Stuart Kings Within half a decade after the death of Hooker, James I came to the throne. A pagan Renaissance monarch to the ‘core, 11 James I asserted the divine right of kings far more forcefully than Hooker had. He viewed kingship as directly under God, without any refer- ence to the sovereignty of the people. “It is atheisme and blasphemic to dispute what God can doe, so it is presumption and high contempt in a subject, to dispute what a King can doe. . . . “12 This arrogance did not go without a challenge.

The theoretical and institutional battle between Stuart kings and Parliament began. It ended only with the Revolution of 1688. In the Puritan Revolution of the 1640’s, Parliament conducted its revolt against James I’s son Charles I in the name of both God and the people. Obviously, the Jacobite concept of the divine right of kings had to be jettisoned. But jettisoned in the name of what earthly agent? The divine-right doctrine always meant that the named agent would be the final earthly court of appeal. The person of the king had been that sole agent, Charles I’s father had maintained. Not so, said Parliament. They reasserted the older Protestant view of the sovereignty of God as delegated to all civil governments through the people. 14 Nevertheless, during the Restoration period, 1660-1688, the views of James I resurfaced. In an 1681 address to Charles II by the University of Cambridge, we read: We will still believe and maintain that our kings derive not their title from the people but from God; that to him only they are accountable; that it belongs not to subjects, either to create or censure but to honour and obey their sovereign, who comes to be so by a fundamental hereditary right of succession, which no religion, no law, no fault of forfeiture can alter or diminish. 15 The Tn”umph of Parliament These sentiments did not last long. Parliament overthrew Charles II’s son James II in 1688. Nevertheless, the problem of sovereignty still remained: someone must speak for the People-Deity in the Peo- ple’s corporate political capacity. The Parliament asserted that Parliament’s sovereignty is unbounded. In this political theorists were following Sir Edward Coke [“Cook”], who had drawn James I’s ire for his defense of absolute Parliamentary sovereignty. This view of Parliamentary sovereignty was carried down in William Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765) to the era immediately preceding the American Revolution. As we have 13.

It is binding over all the globe, in all coun- tries, and at all times; no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this.’ . . .“1 7 Yet he also defended the absolute sovereignty of Parliament, indicating that he believed that Parliament always and inevitably adhered to the dictates of natural law. Blackstone began his defense of Parliamentary sovereignty by citing Coke. “Sir Ed- ward Coke says: The power and jurisdiction of Parliament is so tran- scendent and absolute, that it cannot be confined, either for causes and persons, within any bounds.” Blackstone continued in this vein: “It can, in short, do everything that is not naturally impossible; and therefore some have not scrupled to call its power, by a figure rather too bold, the omnipotence of Parliament. True it is, that what the Parliament cloth, no authority on earth can undo.” 1s Blackstone was wrong: beginning eleven years later, the American colonies undid a lot of what Parliament had done. The American Revolution The American Revolution was a revolt against Blackstone’s view of Parliamentary sovereignty. This revolt was conducted after 1774 in the name of the legitimate legislative sovereignty of the colonial parliaments, i.e., the state assemblies. During the Revolutionary War, the state legislatures transferred specified portions of their own limited sovereignty to Congress. Late in the war, they transferred lim- ited sovereignty again to the central government in the Articles of Confederation (1781). This transfer was then challenged by the Con- stitutional Convention in 1787 and by the ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1788. But the fundamental intellectual question of the Revolution, as historian Bernard Bailyn has maintained, was the question of sovereignty. “Representation and consent, constitution and rights — these were basic problems, consideration of which led to shifts in thought that helped shape the character of American 16.

But of all the intellectual problems the colonists faced, one was absolutely crucial: in the last analysis it was over this issue that the Revolution was fought.” 19 The solution to this intellectual problem was settled in a prelimi- nary way in 1788, with the ratification of the Constitution; it was set- tled more decisively on the battlefields of 1861-65. But it is still not settled in the United States. It will not be settled historically in any nation until the whole world formally affirms the crown rights of King Jesus. Z“ What I assume in this section of Political Po@heism is that the Ar- ticles of Confederation served as a halfway national covenant. This chapter is about the Constitution, but the Constitution was the cove- nantal successor of the Articles. The Articles did not explicitly deny that the God of the Bible is Lord over all governments, nor did they affirm it. Several of the state constitutions did affirm this. Thus, the national civil government was a covenantal mixture, for the national government prior to 1788 was a confederation, not a unitary state. It was a halfway covenant. As we shall see, the U.S. Constitution is far more consistent. What the Articles did not positively affirm, the Constitution positively denies: the legitimacy of religious test oaths as a screening device for officers of the national civil government. It is this shift that marks the transition from the older Trinitarian state covenants to what became, over decades, apostate state covenants. This transition at the national level did not occur overnight; there was an intermediary step: the Articles of Confederation. Yet when the next-to-the last step was taken — the Constitutional Convention — those who took it ignored the original by-laws of the Articles and appealed forward to the People. The Framers publicly ignored the Declaration of Independence, which had formally incorporated the national government, for they were interested in upholding the myth of the sovereign People, and the Declaration had repeatedly men- tioned God. Thus, the Declaration and the Articles both disap- peared from the American judicial tradition and its system of legal precedents, and the Articles disappeared from American political thought. Two things were retained, however: the national name es- 19. Bernard Bailyn, The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1967), p. 198. 20.

The Articles of Confederation What was wrong with the Articles? According to Madison and the critics, it was the absence of sanctions. There was no power to tax and compel payment. Also, there was no executive who could enforce sanctions. In his letter to George Washington (April 16, 1787), Madison insisted: “A National Executive must also be pro- vided. . . . In like manner the right of coercion should be expressly declared.”zl In that same month, a month before the convening of the Convention, Madison had noted his objections to the Articles in his unpublished “Vices of the Political System of the United States.” He included this momentous criticism: “A sanction is essential to the idea of law, as coercion is to that of Government. The federal system being destitute of both, wants the great vital principles of a Political Constitution. Under the form of such a constitution, it is in fact nothing more than a treaty of amity of commerce and of alliance, be- tween independent and Sovereign States .“22 He wanted more than a treaty. He wanted a national govern- ment. But this, he knew, had been achieved in the past only through an agreement regarding a common god that sanctioned the creation of civil government. Without such a god to sanction the civil govern- ment, the government could not legitimate y impose sanctions on those under its jurisdiction. The sanction on the people could only be justified in terms of the ultimate sanctioning power of the agreed- upon god of the covenant. What Madison and the Framers proposed was a revolutionary break from the history of mankind’s govern- ments, with only one glaring exception: the state of Rhode Island — the number-one obstructionist state that had produced the paraly- sis of the Confederation. But instead of abandoning the covenantal legacy of Rhode Island, the Framers adopted it as the judicial foun- dation of the proposed national government. The leaven of neutral- ity would now leaven the whole lump. 21.

Each of these is a separate juridical sphere. Each has its own section in the document itself. For a law (piece of legislation) to be binding, all three branches must agree. Originally, this was not clear to the Framers. They believed that the agreement of the executive and the legislature would be suffi- cient. They divided the legislative branch into two sections, House of Representatives and Senate. Very little was said of the judicial branch. It was assumed that it would be by far the weakest of the three. Alexander Hamilton went so far as to say that “the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power,” , and assured his readers that “it can never attack with success either of the other two; and that all possible care is requisite to enable it to defend itself against their attacks.”2 3 The Framers did not recognize that he who int~pret.s the law authoritative~ is in fact the true voice of sovere- ign maj”esty. They also did not fully understand that the implicitly vast powers of political centralization that the Constitution created on a national level would lead to the creation of a new hierarchy, The federal (national) government would steadily swallow up subor- dinate jurisdictions. Why? Because in any covenant, there must be a hierarchy, and the pinnacle of that hierarchy is the agent who pos- sesses the authority to announce the law and therefore sanctify the law’s sanctions. So, there was initial confusion over hierarchy and representa- tion, point two of the biblical covenant model. This had been the great political debate immediately prior to the Revolution: Which body had legitimate legislative sovereignty in the colonies, the Eng- lish Parliament or the colonial legislatures? This was also the heart of the political debate over the Bill of Rights, the first ten amend- ments to the Constitution. The voters, as represented by state ratify- ing conventions in 1788, had insisted on retaining numerous powers in the states. Any power not expressly transferred to the central gov- ernment automatically resides in the states (Amendment 10). Thus, the debate became one of states’ rights vs. national power. 23.

In December of 1787, the final volume appeared of Adams’ famous three-volume study of the state constitutions, A D@nse of the Constitu- tions of the Government of the United States. The first volume had ap- peared while the Convention was assembling. This study was a defense of the idea of the separation of powers, a theme that he had written about earlier. Adams had been the primary architect of the 1780 Massachusetts constitution. Thus, his blunt speaking was both representative of the new worldview and authoritative nationally. He viewed their earlier constitution-writing actions as unique in his- tory: the creation of a republic founded on the sovereignty of the people, with only a brief peripheral mention of Christianity. Notice carefully his reference to Vitruvius, the Roman architect; this fascination with Vitruvius had been basic to European humanism since the Renaissance. 24 It was the general opinion of ancient nations that the Divinity alone was adequate to the important office of giving laws to men. . . . The United States of America have exhibited, perhaps, the first example of govern- ments erected on the simple principles of nature; and if men are now suffi- ciently enlightened to disabuse themselves of artifice, imposture, hypocrisy, and superstition, they will consider this event as an era in their history. . . . It will never be pretended that any persons employed in that service had in- terviews with the gods or were in any degree under the inspiration of Heaven, more than those at work upon ships or houses, or laboring in mer- chandise or agriculture; it will forever be acknowledged that these govern- ments were contrived merely by the use of reason and the senses, . . . Neither the people nor their conventions, committees, or subcommittees considered legislation in any other light than as ordinary arts and sciences, only more important. Called without expectation and compelled without previous inclination, though undoubtedly at the best period of time, both for England and America, suddenly to erect new systems of laws for their future government, they adopted the method of a wise architect in erecting a new palace for the residence of his sovereign. They determined to consult Vitruvius, Palladio, and all other writers of reputation in the art; to ex- amine the most celebrated buildings, whether they remain entire or in ruins; to compare these with the principles of writers; and to enquire how 24.

Thirteen governments thus founded on the natural authority of the people alone, without a pretense of miracle or mystery, . ..25 Adams’ fascination with the example of Vitruvius, who had become a magician in the writings of Renaissance neoplatonists, is ignored by modern historians. Adams was not speaking of building physical structures; he was speaking of constructing civil covenants. He used the analogy of looking at the records of ancient buildings when he really meant a close examination of ancient constitutions. He saw himself as the chief architect of new civil governments for a new age. Although he was in England at the time, the great architectural work was in progress when his first volume appeared. He knew that it would be. Adams briefly mentioned Christianity: “The experiment is made and has completely succeeded; it can no longer be called in question whether authority in magistrates and obedience of citizens can be ,gounded on reason, morality, and the Christian religion, without the monkery of priests or the knavery of politicians .“Z6 In short, a state constitution can be architecturally constructed without benefit of clergy or elected politicians. This is exactly what the delegates at Philadelphia intended to prove at the national level. The architects were about to rebuild the structure of American government on a foundation that would have been unrecognizable to the Founding Fathers of the seventeenth century, with one exception: Roger Williams. Before the Constitution The Framers knew that religious test oaths were required for tes- tifying in local and state courts. The word “test” in both cases — test oath and testify — refers back to the biblical language of the cove- nant, i.e., testament. It refers judicially to a witness who testifies in a court. The Framers knew that religious oaths were sometimes re- quired for exercising the franchise in state elections. But they made it clear: federal~’ura”sdiction is to be governed by another covenant, and therefore by another god. It is therefore a rival system of hierarchy. lt is not a complementary system of courts; it is rival system, for an oath to the God of the Bible is prohibited by law in one of these hierarchies. 25.

He could be recalled at any time. He could serve in only three years out of every six. He was under public scrutiny continually. And to exercise the authority entrusted to him by his state legislature, he had to take an oath. These oaths in most states were both political and religious. The officer of the state had to swear allegiance to the state constitution and also allegiance to God. Consider Delaware’s required oath: Art. 22. Every person who shall be chosen a member of either house, or ap- pointed to any office or place of trust, before taking his seat, or entering upon the execution of his office, shall take the following oath, or affirma- tion, if conscientiously scrupulous of taking an oath, to wit: “I, A B, will bear true allegiance to the Delaware State, submit to its constitution and laws, and do no act wittingly whereby the freedom thereof may be prejudiced.” And also make and subscribe the following declaration, to wit: “I, A B, do profess faith in God the Father, and in Jesus Christ His only Son, and in the Holy Ghost, one God, blessed for evermore; and I do acknowledge the holy scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be given by divine inspiration.” And all officers shall also take an oath of office. 27 The Constitution of Vermont in 1777 was not much different: Section IX. A quorum of the house of representatives shall consist of two- thirds of the whole number of members elected and having met and chosen their speaker, shall, each of them, before they proceed to business, take and subscribe, as well the oath of fidelity and allegiance herein after directed, as the following oath or affirmation, viz.

In order to break this Trinitarian monopoly, the Framers had to undermine the states’ oaths. A New Covenant Oath 1 began this chapter with Article VI of the Constitution, which prohibits religious oaths as a requirement for holding federal office. This is not one of the better known sections of the Constitution. It is seldom discussed by historians. w Typical is Saul K.

When he comes to Article VI, he does not even mention Clause 3; he summarizes only the debate over the oath of allegiance to the Consti- tution. ~ Even more amazing is the near-silence of Edwin S. Corwin, acknowledged as the twentieth-century master of the Constitution: one brief, undistinguished paragraph out of ten pages devoted to Article VI. 31 Everyone today assumes automatically that no religious test should be administered as a requirement for holding public office. Everyone also assumes that office-holders should swear allegiance to the Constitution. Yet in 1787, the reverse was true. There was con- siderable debate at the Constitutional Convention regarding the pro- priety of requiring state office-holders to swear allegiance to the Con- stitution. Furthermore, the states had religious tests of various kinds for office holders. A great reversal in the legal structure of the nation took place when the Constitution was ratified, and this is re- 28. Idetn. 29.

A great change in public thinking also took - place subsequent to ratification. The ratification of the Constitution was in fact simultaneously a covenant-breaking and covenant-making act. As with all covenant acts, this one involved the acknowledgment of legitimacy. When the voters sent the first representatives to the Congress in Philadelphia in 1789, the legitimacy of the new government was secured. 32 The theological and judicial terms of the new covenant began to be imitated at the state level until the resistance of the South called a halt to this process. The Civil War and the Fourteenth Amendment revived it. Article VI, Clause 3, established the third covenantal pillar of what is one of the three keys to a proper understanding of the nature of the Constitutional covenant. The first pillar is the locus o~ authorizing sovereignty: the People. This is the designated creator of the covenant. This appears as the Constitution’s Preamble. The second pillar is the nature of political participation: the authorizing electorate. Who is a citi- zen? This establishes the nature of, and legal access to, formal acts of covenant renewal in a republican system of government. This was not definitively settled until the passage of the Fourteenth Amend- ment in 1868. The third pillar is the nature of public oaths by federal oJh- cers. This is the authorized representative’s act of formal covenant affirmation of, and subordination to, the terms of the covenant. An officer is the person who is charged with the assignment of en- forcing the covenant’s sanctions (point four of the biblical covenant). He must therefore swear allegiance to the covenant – subordination (point two) – and also to its stipulations (point three). He agrees to obey the law. In the biblical covenant, this agent must also swear allegiance to the Sovereign Himself God. This last requirement is dealt with in Article VI. Article VI represents the Constitution’s de- finitive break with the previous American political tradition except Rhode Island’s, and with all previous civil covenants except Rhode Island’s.

The basic principle of any covenant is that all those under the cove- nant? sanctions are to be governed by its statutes and provisions. The public mark of being under the sovereign is the taking of an oath. Public officers must take the oath verbally. They are to enforce the law of the covenant by imposing the sanctions of the covenant. If they do not swear to uphold it, they are not legally entitled to define, inter- pret, or enforce its sanctions. State officers have to swear allegiance to the Constitution. The final prohibition by the federal government on the states with regard to religious test oaths came in 1961.33 The weak link in the oath system was the U. S. Senate. A Senator was an indirectly appointed officer. The state legislatures elected Senators. Thus, a preliminary screening based on a religious test oath was still likely because the legislatures presumably would elect men from their own ranks. In some states, Senators would already have taken such an oath. This problem did not definitively end until 1913, the year the Constitution was amended to require the direct election of Senators. (That was also the year of the supposed ratifica- tion of the Sixteenth Amendment, the income tax, which was rati- fied as illegally as the Fourteenth Amendment was. 3A The other ma- jor national judicial event of 1913 was the passage of the Federal Reserve Act, which created the nation’s quasi-private central bank.)

He was the most eloquent defender of the strongest possible national govern- ment. In Federalist 27, he stated plainly what was being done by means of this required oath. A new judicial relationship was being created by the Constitution: a direct covenant between the new national civil government with the individual citizen, without any internwdiary civil government. (This alteration is generally regarded by legal theorists as the most important single innovation that the Constitution imposed. They are wrong; the prohibition of religious test oaths was its most innovative breakthrough: one nation, under the god of the People, indivisible, with a civil war to prove it. ) The lack of intermediate governments, social and civil, between the individual and the national civil government, was the heart of Rousseau’s concept of the General Will, meaning the heart of Rousseau’s totalitarianism, as Robert Nisbet and many other scholars have argued. 3s Because the colonial political and social traditions were Christian, and therefore decentralist and institutionally pluralist (though not ethically and confessionally pluralist), the C-onstitution would not have been ratified by the existing Congress. The Phila- delphia conspirators fully understood this. They were ready to aban- don the colonial Christian tradition of decentralized power. Hamilton made it clear that the Constitution, when ratified, would take a major step forward in the direction of Rousseau’s General Will ideal of weakening intermediary civil governments. He wrote: 35. Max Farrand (cd.), Recorh of the Fedmal Convention, I, p. 203; extract in Founders’ Constitution, IV, p. 637. 36. Records, I, p. 207; idem. 37.

It merits particular attention in this place, that the laws of the confederacy, as to the enumerated and legiti- mate objects of its jurisdiction, will become the SUPREME LAW of the land; to the observance of which, all officers legislative, executive and judi- cial in each State, will be bound by the sanctity of an oath.

He under- stood very well the important role it would play judicially and also in public opinion. Objections to this national loyalty oath were raised at the Con- vention.

That meant, in the context of the required state oaths, a Chri>tian loyalty oath. At this point, the arguments for and against oaths were reversed. There is no need for such an oath, most of the Convention’s delegates concluded. Echoing Wilson’s com- ments on the uselessness of a federal oath, Madison later wrote to Edmund Pendleton: “Is not a religious test as far as it is necessary, or would be operate, involved in the oath itself?

He would sub- scribe to it as he would take the oath, without any principle that could be affected by either.~41 In short, a believer already believes; a liar will subscribe; so why bother with an oath? This argument was used by other defenders of the abolition of a religious test oath. 42 But the argument misses a key point: What about hme~t Deists and Unitarians who would not want to betray their principles by taking a false oath to a Trinitarian God? A Christian oath would bar them from serving as covenantal agents of the ultimate sovereign, the God of the Bible. By removing the requirement of the oath, the Convention’s delegates were in fact opening up the door to federal office-holding that would otherwise be closed to honest non-Chris- tians, a point observed by some of the defenders of the removal of the religious test. 43 It would also open up offices of authorit y to men who had taken other binding oaths that were hostile to Christiani~ — men who had taken these rival oaths in goodfaith. That possibility was never openly discussed, but it was a possibility which lay silently in the back- ground of the closed Convention in Philadelphia.

It was not heeded. But this objection was more distinctively political and practical. The more important issue was covenantal, but the opponents of the Constitution did not fully understand this. (Surely today’s textbook commentators do not.) The officers of the U.S. government are not to be subjected to a religious test for hold- ing office. We must understand what this means. It means that ciuil oj$cers are not under an oath to the God of the Bible. It means that in the exercise of their various offices, civil magistrates are bound by an oath to a different god. That god is the American People, considered as an au- tonomous sovereign who possesses original andjnal earthly jurisdic- tion. This view of the sovereign People is radically different from anything that had been formally stated or publicly assumed by pre- vious Christian political philosophers. The People were no longer acting as God’s delegated judicial agents but as their own agent. This same view of political sovereignty undergirded Rousseau’s political theory, and also the various constitutions of the French Revolution. The ratification of the U. S. Constitution was therefore a formal covenantal step toward the left-wing Enlightenment and away from the halfway covenant political philosophy of Christianity combined with right-wing Scottish Enlightenment rationalism. 46 It would take the rise of Darwinism and the victory of the North in the Civil War to make clear the judicial nature of this definitive step to- ward Rousseau’s unholy commonwealth. 47 The Fourteenth Amendment (1868) brought the federal govern- ment’s religious toleration to the states, a procedure originally denied to the federal government by the First Amendment, which 45.

The first sentence of Clause 1 reads: All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and the State wherein they reside. This amendment was added in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War. Why so late? Because the Constitution had not previously defined “citizen.” Citizenship was left to the individual states to define. After the Civil War, freed slaves needed protection. Thus, they were made citizens under the protection of the law. They had not been protected as citizens prior to the war. This was one reason why the Constitution had been silent regarding citizenship: to avoid a walk-out by Southern delegates to the Convention. T&ing the Oath of Citizenship American citizens now take this inherently atheistic civil oath. They take it at birth. It is taken implicit~ and representatz’ve~. They are citizens by birth. This concept — citizenship by physical birth and geography – is crucial in understanding the transformation of the American covenant. It made civil covenant membership dependent on an oath of strictly civil subordination rather than profession of re- ligious faith, i.e., ecclesiastical and civil subordination. In the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the seventeenth century, an adult male became a citizen by formal church covenant. With- out formal church membership, he was merely a town resident, not a citizen. This system began to break down almost from the begin- ning; becoming a property holder made you eligible to vote in town elections, though not in colony-wide elections. Steadily, the pos- session of capital replaced the oath as the basis of political citizen- ship. Later, the formal development of this principle of civil contract 51.

God’s name was brought into the proceedings. Locke was aware of the binding nature of an oath, and also its religious foundations. In his Essay on Toleration (1685), he specifically exempted the atheist from the civil protection of toleration: “Lastly, those are not all to be tolerated who deny the being of God. Promises, covenants, and oaths, which are the bonds of human society, can have no hold upon an atheist. The taking away of God, though but even in thought, dissolves all; besides also, those that by their atheism undermine and destroy all religion, can have no pretence of religion whereupon to challenge the privilege of toleration .“5 4 The oath to God reminded a citizen of the Sovereign who would impose sanctions on courtroom liars, so men were required to swear with one hand on a Bible and the other one raised toward heaven. Presidents still do this when they have the Constitutional oath administered to them. This rite is not required by law. It is an empty formal rite in the eyes of most people, yet rites are never entirely empty. There is always some mys- terious element in a rite, some degree of foreboding if the proper tra- ditional formulas are not observed.

An American edition of his Treatise on Ciuil Government did not appear until 1773. His influence was indirect through his popularizers, just as Newton’s influence was. Of far greater direct influence were the writings of the 1720’s by John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon in Cato’s Letters and The Independent Whig. See Bailyn, IaZological Origim, pp. 25-36, 43-45. Nevertheless, Locke’s indirect influence, like Newton’s, should not be underestimated. See Thomas L.

There is no escape from this aspect of temporal continuity. The primary ques- tion of covenantal sanctions is this one: Who authorizes the applica- tion of the covenant’s sanctions? The answer: the one who administers the covenant oath. Therefore, we need to identify the character of the civil oath. The Constitution is clear: “. . . no religious Test shall ever be required as ‘a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.” The second sentence of Clause 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment has been the wedge by which federal judicial sovereignty has split apart the original Constitutional federalism (although this was not fully apparent until the rise of Progressivism in the early twentieth century).5G No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

John Locke, the defender of universal natural rights through universal natural law, substituted the concept of the civil contract or civil compact for the biblical notion of civil covenant. So did Jean Jac- ques Rousseau. The rival political philosophies of the two wings of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, Scottish a po.steriori (em- pirical) rationalism vs. French a Priori (deductive) rationalism, devel- oped out of these two rival conceptions of the civil contract. Locke’s compact offered three stated goals that provided legitimacy to any civil contract: life (i. e., self-preservation), liberty, and property. Rousseau’s had none: the General Will spoke through the State, and none could stay its hand. The French Revolutionaries, especially the Jacobins, picked up the slogan of French Grand Orient Masonry, “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,”64 and fused it with Rousseau’s General Will. Rousseau’s political theology was totalitarian; so was the French Revolution .65 The Two Revolutions One important difference that distinguishes the ideological defense of the American Revolution from that of the French Revolu- tion can be seen in these rival Enlightenment concepts of civil con- tract. Locke’s version of the theory had something specific in history that could identify a valid civil compact: its defense of private prop- erty. He made this the touchstone of his political theory: “The great and chief end, therefore, of Mens uniting into Commonwealths, and putting themselves under Government, is the Preservation of their Prop- erty.”ti The French view of the social contract had no link between the transcendent sovereign will and history, except the voice of the political sovereign. Jefferson hesitated to use Locke’s proper~ and substituted pursuit of happiness. It is not clear why he did this.

Perhaps he was merely writing to please the philosopher and intellectuals in France, knowing well their prefer- ence for grand slogans devoid of historical content. a Or perhaps the reason may have been merely stylistic. ‘ig There is also another factor, one recognized by British political philosopher A.

But in France there was only one church, regarded in the minds of the upholders of the Revolution as an enemy of the state and therefore in their mind an institution to be attacked, not to be secured in its liberties. ”’” In short, it was the eccle- siastical pluralism of competing Tn”nitarian churches that made possible the Americans’ confidence in the possibility of limited civil government. This acceptance of ecclesiastical pluralism within thejudicialframework of confessional Trinitarianism then led to the public’s naive acceptance of a radically different doctrine: the religious Pluralism of a nation’s moral and ~“udicial foundations. This same confusion of concepts — judicial blindness – is the foundation of modern Christian political pluralism. 71 This distinction was not clearly understood by most Christian voters in 1788 when they voted for and against ratification. Most of them simply assumed that Trinitarianism was socially normative in America, and also that it would probably continue to be normative. The distinction between confessional pluralism and ecclesiastical pluralism under a common Trinitarian confession was understood, and well understood, by the intellectual leaders of the Constitutional Convention, as we shall see.

But could this be considered both necessary and sufficient in late eighteenth-century American life? Would there not also have to be an appeal to God? There was no escape. There had to be an appeal to God. This was what Hume sensed, and he forthrightly rejected all traces of theism in his political theory. Locke had known better. At the end of his Second Treatise, he invoked the name of God. He did so when he raised the question of sanctions. We can see here his attempted fu- sion between Christianity and natural law theory. It was an attemp- ted fusion that has dominated Christian political theory down to our own era. He raised the question of the right of political rebellion, the dissolution of the compact. Here, it is like, the common question will be made: Who is to judge whether the prince or legislative act contrary to their trust? This, perhaps, ill-affected and factious men may spread among the people, when the prince only makes use of his due prerogative. To this I reply: the people shall be judge. . . . But further, this question, Who shall be the judge? can- not mean that there is no judge at all; for where there is no judicature on earth to decide controversies among men, God in heaven is Judge. He alone, it is true, is Judge of the right. But every man is judge for himself, as in all other cases, so in this, whether another has put himself into a state of war with him, and whether he should appeal to the Supreme Judge, as Jephthah did.” So, there was some degree of transcendence in Locke’s system. But he invoked the name of an undefined God rather than an earthly hierarchy in formal covenant with a specific God. He placed man as a sovereign agent acting directly under God. There is no hierar- chical chain of command, no hierarchy of temporal appeal, no doc- trine of d%jlned representation, in Locke’s concept — a limiting concept or convenient theoretical backdrop — of a theocratic covenant. How is God to enforce His transcendent covenant in the midst of history? Directly or mediatorially through specific judicial institutions? That was the question Locke needed to answer. He did not even attempt to do SO. Rousseau and Darwin Rousseau’s concept of political legitimacy was strictly immanent. In his system, there is no transcendent Sovereign who enforces the 78.

All other loyalties are to be excluded, which is the heart of his totalitarianism. 79 The Constitution follows Rousseau. The laws are the product of exclusively human deliberation. The sanctions are exclusively historical, so the oath acknowledges only the authority of the document and, by im- plication, the amorphous sovereign People.

The transcendent was erased from scientific cause and effect. God the Creator, Sustainer, and Judge was shoved unceremoniously out of the cosmos. The Darwinian worldview. rapidly swept the field of law as surely as it swept every other academic field. This took less than a generation. Process phi- losophy fused with democratic theory to produce a concept of law completely divorced from the transcendent. The judicial result can be found in Oliver Wendell Holmes’ The Common Law (1881), a defense of unrestricted judicial sovereignty, but all in the name of the evolving preferences of the judges and the electorate. Evolutionism: From Witherspoon to Holmes The element of evolutionism was inherent in Scottish Enlighten- ment theory. The empiricism of Scottish common sense realism was inherently evolutionary. There is a connection between the judicial theory of Scottish empiricism and post-Darwinian theories of justice. Holmes announced: “The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience.” Over a century earlier, Witherspoon had taught Madison and his other students that philosophers could not agree on the answer to the question: “What distinguishes man from the animals?” The philosophers, Witherspoon said, had wanted to find one in- communicable characteristic in man, but they could not find one: reason, memory, laughter, religion, and a sense of ridicule. so Wither- spoon was not sure what the difference between man and beast is. He appealed to “the beauty of his form, which the poet takes note of,”81 an argument that no longer carries any weight in a world of 79.

He listed ‘the knowledge of God and a future state,” another dead argument in the eyes of the secular humanist. 82 This was philosophically convenient in the eigh- teenth century. It is no longer even remotely convenient. The Framers also could have appealed to this eschatological aspect of church teaching in their quest for public support of the na- tional government, but Article VI, Clause 3 removed the idea as a covenantally serious factor. The civil oath of the nation was severed from any conception of God’s sanctions in eternity. In fact, Wither- spoon could not, given his empiricism, locate a fixed, reliably incom- municable attribute in man that is acknowledged by autonomous man’s philosophy. This was the unmistakable message of his Lectures on Moral Philosophy. He appealed to an undefined virtue, as but so did the Deists and Unitarians. So had the Renaissance atheists and Renaissance magicians. What he and all eighteenth-century Protestant moral philoso- phers refused to appeal to was biblical law. He wanted something else — anything else or evqthing else — to serve as the transcript of God’s moral nature: “The result of the whole is, that we ought to take the role of duty from conscience enlightened by reason, experience, and every way by which we can be supposed to learn the will of our Maker, and by intention in creating us such’ as we are. And we ought to believe that it is as deeply founded as the nature of God himself, being a transcript of his moral excellence, and that it is productive of the greatest good.”s4 Without the biblical doctrine of creation and the doctrine of man as the image of God, there is no incommunicable attribute in man to separate him from the animals. When Darwin destroyed both the historic and biological barriers between man and animal, the re- strained evolutionism of Locke and his successors in Scotland was transformed into the modern version. Only biblical covenantalism can negate evolutionism and its ethics of temporary power. It was biblical covenantalism that the Framers self-consciously abandoned.

Christians who do not analyze social and political institu- tions in terms of the biblical covenant model are not sufficiently alert to this crucial but neglected section of the Constitution. The Constitut- ion is not a Christian covenant document; it is a secular humanist covenant document. While there have been many attempts over the years by Christians to evade this conclusion, they have all been unsupported with primary source documents; these attempts have also been ob- scurely argued. (That the phrase “Lord” appears in Article VII, “the Seventeenth Day of September in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eight y Seven, “ is not what I would call a per- suasive argument for its Christian character. )‘5 It has taken the Civil War, the Fourteenth Amendment, and the last half century of Supreme Court interpretations to make the Constitution’s humanistic foundation obvious to everyone except a handful of Christian historians. (That the Fourteenth Amendment was never legally ratified is not mentioned in public school textbooks. 86 It was a post-war imposition. ) I realize that I am breaking with the fundamental thesis of the Rushdoony-Hall-Slater-Whitehead-CBN University interpretation of American Constitutional history. I am also breaking with C. Gregg Singer’s thesis of the “Deist Declaration” of Independence, and the idea of the Constitution as somewhat more Christian, some- what more conservative. Singer proves more than he suspects when he says that “The basic philosophies of the two documents were not compatible.”87 Both documents were humanistic, but the Constitution abandons natural rights philosophy. If anything, the Declaration was more Christian; Congress added two extra references to God. ss Of course, that god was the undefined god of common civil cere- monies of the era, or perhaps more to the point, common Masonic ceremonies. While Harold O. J, Brown does not pursue the matter, he has put his finger on the problem: “America’s symbolism is not really theism at all, even of an Old Testament variety. The Seeing Eye is sometimes found in Christian art, but on the Great Seal of the 85. This argument was offered seriously by a Christian legal scholar.

The Congress on July 4 appointed a committee to recommend designs for a seal of the U.S. The commit- tee was made up of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Benjamin Franklin.’0 The obverse (front) of the Great Seal is the eagle. The re- verse of the Great Seal is the all-seeing eye above a pyramid, a famil- iar Masonic symbol. There is an oddity here, one which is seldom mentioned: there is no reverse side of a corporate seal. A seal is used to produce an impression. It is either a one-piece seal for impressing wax, or a convex and concave matching pair for impressing a piece of paper. (This “reverse seal” was ignored by the government for a century and a half until Henry A. Wallace, Franklin Roosevelt’s politically radical Secretary of Agriculturegl and resident occult mystic, persuaded the Secretary of the Treasury to restore it to public view by placing it on the back of the one dollar bill, the most common currency unit. This was done in 1935, and remains with us still. )gz We have returned symbolically in this century to the original national halfivay covenant – the Declaration and the Articles of Confederation — that invoked the god of Masonry. Men need sym~lic manifesta- tions of ultimate sovereignty, and the eagle is no longer sufficient in a judicially secular age of confusion and despair. The eagle, the sym- bol on the national seal under the Declaration and the Articles, is no longer the sole national image that pops into Americans’ minds. 89. Harold O. J.

Three of the five-man committee that was responsible for writing it were Unitarians: Jefferson, Franklin, and John Adams. 93 Three were Masons: Roger Sherman,g4 Robert Livingston,gs and Franklin. As David Hawke writes of Adams: ‘He verged on deism in religion and found it no easier than Jefferson to admit his wayward- ness publicly. He respected the findings of natural philosophy and was inclined to extend those findings into the social and political world. He believed that natural law resembled the axioms of mathe- matics — ‘Self-evident principles, that every man must assent to as soon as proposed.’ “96 In their old age, Adams and Jefferson renewed their friendship in a long correspondence, and their letters reveal that they were almost totally agreed on religion. They hated Christi- anity, especially Calvinism. 97 In Jefferson’s April 11, 1823, letter to Adams, he announced that if anyone ever worshiped a false God, Calvin did. Calvin’s religion, he said, was “Daemonianism,” mean- ing blasphemy. gs He knew that Adams was already in basic agree- ment with him in these opinions. After surveying their letters, Cushing Strout concludes: Whatever their political differences, Jefferson and Adams were virtually at one in their religion.” He identifies the creed of this religion: Unitarianism. ~ Jefferson was really systematic in his hatred of Trinitarian Chris- tianity. In his old age, he sent a letter to James Smith, which he stressed was confidential, in which he expressed confidence that “the present generation will see Unitarianism become the general reli- 93.

As Pangle asks: “Can belief in im- mortality of the soul or in providential interventions in this life be divorced from belief in miracles, and can one easily confine theologi- cal disputation once one encourages the belief in miracles? We search in vain for answers in Jefferson’s writings, public or private. . . . “1OS The same question must be posed regarding the other Framers’ views, and the same silence is ominous. Many of them based their hopes of social stability on a religion they had personally rejected. They drew large drafts on a Trinitarian cultural bank account into which they made few deposits in their lifetimes. The Declaration of Independence The Declaration of Independence announced the creation of a new nation in 1776. The day it was approved, July 4, 1776, the Con- gress authorized a committee to create a national seal. A seal is an aspect of incorporation, just as baptism is. This is why we know that the Declaration was an incorporating document. The by-laws of the nation were agreed to in November of 1777, but they were not rati- fied until 1781: the Articles of Confederation. What very few people are ever told today is that this was not the full name of the Articles. The document was called, “Articles of Confederation and perpetual Union between the States. . . .” It then listed the 13 states by name. The words “perpetual Union” reveal the nature of the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and the call for state ratifying conventions: an initially illegal revocation of the original by-laws of the nation, which was to have been a perpetual union. This original union was legally dissolved in 1788 by the ratifica- tion of the Constitution. A new Deity was identified, “We the People.” The old Deity of the Declaration, the undefined god of 100.

This is why the Framers made no mention of the Declaration: it was this halfway covenant that was self-consciously being replaced. But the Framers knew that the new nation would need symbolic continuity to support the judicial discontinuity. First, the Articles’ official designation of the Confederation as “the United States” was retained in the new by- laws in order to provide the illusion of judicial continuity: ‘We the people of the United States. . . .” (The same public relations strat- egy was used in 1945 when the name United Nations, which had been used to designate the Allied forces during World War II, was appropriated by the international organization known thereafter as the United Nations.) Second, they appropriated the other visible token of national continuity: the Great Seal. (An analogous revolution can be seen in twentieth-century American churches. The apostates who control today’s mainline churches have scrapped the creeds of the churches, but they still administer the sacraments. The churches have reduced the pro- cedural signs of the original covenant oath to mere formalities, yet these formalities still convey a sense of legitimacy and continuity. They are the signs of continuity with the past, despite the fact that the church covenant has been broken, as the revisions of the creeds reveal, denomination by denomination, but especially the Presby- terians, who have been the most creedal church of all, with the most rigorous creed. lw) Two questions need to be answered. First, if the foundational documen~s of the American civil covenant are Deistic and humanis- tic, then why did Bible-believing Christians agree to define the Rev- olutionary War as Jefferson did in the Declaration of Independence? Second, why did Christians ratify the Constitution? To answer the first question, we need to recognize that the Declaration was never directly ratified by the voters. They ratified it only representatively, through the officials sent to Congress by state revolutionary legislatures. Nobody in the colonial public paid much attention to the Declaration. It was not ratified by anyone outside the Assembly in 1776. It was signed in August. 105 The names of the signers were not released until January of 1777. lw The Declaration 104.

Jefferson’s supporters resurrected it as a symbol of their candidate’s importance, much to the displeasure of Adams, who was one of the five men on the com- mittee that was responsible for drafting it. The Federalist Party did its best to de-emphasize Jefferson’s part in the Declaration’s draft- ing. lcN But Adams could hardly deny-that the language and concepts were mostly Jefferson’s.

He was not merely a political representative who happened to be an ordained Presbyterian minister; he was in effect the covenantal representative agent of the Whig-Patriot churches. The British recognized him as such, which is why the military immediately bayoneted the man they believed to be Witherspoon. 111 Witherspoon was crucial to the 107. Zbzd., p. 143. 108.

I have already mentioned the confusion in the minds of the voters regarding confessional pluralism vs. ecclesiasti- cal pluralism under a Trinitarian oath. 113 I consider this question in greater detail in Chapter 9. Before we get to that question, however, we need to consider some neglected facts regarding the actual writ- ing of the Constitution. Here, let the reader be warned, I break with just about everyone. Conclusion Two features of the U.S. Constitution mark it unmistakably as a humanist covenant: the Preamble and the religious test oath clause of Article VI. While the famous phrase of Jefferson’s regarding “a wall of separation between church and State” in his 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists 114 is not in the Constitution in this familiar form, it is nonetheless in the Constitution judicially. While the Preamble has received considerable attention, Article VI, Clause 3 has been almost universally ignored. Despite the silence of the commentators and historians, there is no single covenantal cause of the suppression of Christianit y in America, and therefore in the modern world, that has had greater impact than the test oath clause. It is this clause that established judicially the anti-Christian nature of the Constitutional experiment. While We the People” is viewed by some Constitutional scholars as having no legal impact, the oath clause is so sacrosanct that it receives little attention. Its legitimacy, its normality, is assumed by everyone who reads it. This was generally the case in 1789, too. This fact testifies to the impact of natural law philosophy in the his- tory of Christendom. Ideas do have consequences — in this case, dis- astrous consequences. But few people recognize the cause of the dis- asters. Like the Israelites in Egypt, Christians would rather serve as slaves in the household of God’s enemies than serve those who pro- fess biblical religion. The politics of Christian envy begins with Arti- cle VI, Clause 3. 112. See the Conclusion to Part 3, p. 547. 113. See above, under “Locke’s Legacy: Life, Liberty, and Property; p. 399. 114.

So do its stipulations. Only the sovereign who establishes the oath can change the stipulations or the oath. The ability to change the stipulations or the oath is therefore a mark of ul- timate sovereignty.” The U.S. Constitution can legally be amended. Doesn’t this indicate that the nation’s sovereign is the electorate rather than God? This is exactly what the amending process indi- cates under the present Constitution. This is why the Constitution is a broken covenant. To preserve its judicial continuity, a national covenant must es- tablish the Bible as the law of the land. The Bible is an permanent covenant document. Its stipulations do not change. A nation’s civil courts must therefore enforce the Bible’s civil laws. Any statute not in conformity to the Bible must be declared unconstitutional. An oath of allegiance to the national government is a promise to uphold the national constitution; this must automatically be an oath to up- hold and enforce the Bible. A national constitution is required by God to serve as the by-laws of the ultimate source of legitimate civil law, the Bible. A constitu- tion’s Preamble is the appropriate place to declare this publicly. The Preamble should be a nation’s Declaration of Absolute Dependence on the Trinitarian God of the Bible. The Preamble should therefore declare the Bible as the unchanging law of the land. It should declare this law as being immune to any subsequent alteration. Thus, any public rejection of this judicial standard would be identifiable as a breaking of the national covenant. \\"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"The general Federal Convention that framed the Constitution at Philadelphia was a secret body; and the greatest pains were taken that no part of its proceedings should get to the public until the Con- stitution itself was reported to Congress.

Gover- nor Edmund Randolph of Virginia opened the main business of the Convention on May 29 by giving a speech on why a totally new gov- ernment ought to be created, and he then submitted the fifteen-point Wirginia Plan” or large-states’ plan to restructure the national gov- ernment. This had been drawn up by James Madison. 7 According to New York’s Chief Justice Yates, who became an opponent of the Constitution, and who made notes for his personal use (but not for publication): “He candidly confessed, that they were not intended for a federal government; he meant a strong, consolidated union, in which the idea of States should be nearly annihilated .“ 8 The Articles were completely scrapped by the delegates. There is little doubt that this had been the original intention of the small group of men who first promoted the idea of the Convention, beginning with. the meeting held in the spring of 1785 at Washington’s home at 4. The steps were the decisions of the delegates: 1) to become Framers of a new government; 2) to go beyond their instructions; 3) to designate special conventions to ratify the new document; and 4) to determine that the new government would come into existence when only nine of the state conventions ratified it.

The list of distinguished Americans certain not to come was large. Only one of the great diplomats of the Revolution, Franklin, would be there; John Jay of New York and Henry Laurens of South Carolina had not been chosen, and Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were in Europe as am- bassadors. Most of the great Republicans would likewise be missing. Thomas Paine (’Where liberty is not, Sir, there is my country”) was also in Europe, hoping to spread the gospel of republican revolution. Neither Sam Adams nor John Hancock of Massachusetts nor Richard Henry Lee and Patrick Henry of Virginia chose to come (Henry did not because, he said, “I smelt a rat”; the others offered no excuses). 10 It is important to note that Henry was a dedicated, Bible-believing Christian. 11 Sam Adams, who also refused to attend, was either a 9.

For this, he has been relegated into the “outer darkness” by the historians. I agree entirely with M. E. Bradford’s amusing assessment of the modern historical guild’s treatment of Henry: “Our scholars, most of them rationalists and neo-Federalists, had a vested interest in producing Henry’s present reputation: that he was a simple-minded count-t-y politician turned demagogue, a Populist trimmer whose talents happened to serve his more far-sighted contemporaries when the Revolutionary crisis came. That Madison was the fellow to read, and Jefferson be- fore him– or certain selected Boston radicals, as reprinted under the auspices of the Harvard University Press.” 14 A handful of men had decided to take the new nation down a dif- ferent path. It was not enough to amend the Articles by taking such steps as repealing all internal tariffs and establishing gold or silver coins as legal tender for a national currency. 15 They wanted a com- pletely new system of national government. This would have to be achieved through a coup. Congress was unwilling and probably un- able to undertake such a radical revision of the Articles in 1787. Yet the Articles of Confederation, as the legal by-laws of the national government, specified that all changes would have to be approved by Congress and then by all of the state legislatures: “And the Articles of this confederation shall be inviolably observed by every state, and the union shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a congress of the united states, and be afterwards confi~ed by the legislatures of every state” (Article XIII). Congress and the state legislatures would therefore have to be bypassed. This required some very special preparations. It required, in short, a conspiracy. 12.

(Can you imagine the hue and cry of the press and news media if such a convention were closed to them today? No scoops for Pulitzer Prize-seeking reporters? No “details at eleven”?) So secretive were the attendees that Madison, who was the primary engineer of the COUP and its unofficially designated scribe, 16 refused to allow his transcripts to be published until after his death. They did not be- come public until 1840.17 .This code of silence was mentioned by Warren Burger, shortly after he announced his resignation as Chief Justice of the U. S. Supreme Court, who informed a national televi- sion audience: “1 think one of the reasons of the success of the Con- stitution was the iron code of silence that bound all of the members who were there .“ 1s It was not just Madison who felt so bound. Robert Yates, who was at the time Chief Justice of the State of New York, attended the early days of the Convention. He left in disgust, convinced that the Convention served ill purposes. He had taken notes of the pro- ceedings through July 5. Yet even this opponent of the Constitution refused to publish these notes. In a public transcript of them, pub- lished first in 1838, his anonymous biographer took great care to ex- plain that Yates had not broken the Convention’s code of silence: “Chief Justice Yates, though often solicited, refused during his life, to permit his notes of those debates to be published, not only because they were originally not written for the public eye, but because he conceived himself under honorable obligations to withhold their publication. These notes, after his death, fell into the hands of his widow, who disposed of them, and they are thus become public.” 19 So, the delegates were sworn to secrecy. Gentlemen obviously took oaths seriously back in 1787. Participants who soon opposed the whole procedure as illegal never revealed what had gone on inside 16.

In a modern world filled with “leaks” to the press and everyone else, we can hardly im- agine what it might have been that persuaded these men to keep their silence. I have read no history book that has even raised the question. But of this we can be confident: they all feared some kind of negative sanctions, either external or internal, for breaking this oath of secrecy. When the Convention ended, they took the final step. They handed all the minutes over to George Washington to take back to , Mount Vernon. They knew that no one in the nation would have the audacity to tell George Washington that he had to hand over the evi- dence of what was in fact a COUP. Madison’s notes state specifically that “The president, having asked what the Convention meant should be done with the Journals, &c., whether copies were to be allowed to the members, if applied for, it was resolved, nem con., ‘that he retain the Journal and other papers, subject to the order of Congress, if ever formed under the Constitution .’ The members then proceeded to sign the Constitution. . . . ~ZO In short, if the coup was successful, then the new Congress could gain access to the records. If not, no one would have any written evidence to prove anything except the untouchable General Washington. 21 On that basis, they signed.

To this extent, he implies, it was a fitting end for the old Congress. This is a strange way to argue; nothing in Congress’ history rivaled the degree of secrecy in Philadelphia. Rakove is nevertheless correct: ‘For the most remarkable aspect of the Convention’s four-month in- quiry was that it was conducted in virtually absolute secrecy, un- influenced by external pressures of any kind. . . .

This was a calculated gamble by the members of the convention. The Feo2raltit Papers were propaganda devices to persuade the voters retroactive y to sanction the coup of 1787. The ratification process was in fact a plebiscite for or against the legitimacy of a COUP. As historian Richard Buel, Jr., has pointed out: “Although the Constitution had been designed to remove the national government from the immedi- ate reach of the populace, its power was still ultimately dependent on public opinion. . . . “ 23 The public was allowed to ratify the coup; after that, the voters were to be kept farther at bay. This is why the nation- alists had to submit to their opponents’ demand for the Bill of Rights in 1789. The nationalists resented having to do this, but they had little choice, if the ratification of 1788 was to become a legitimizing event. Once sanctioned by the ratification process, the original con- spirators became, retroactively, Founding Fathers. The fact that it was a coup was concealed to the general public. The victors and their allies wrote the textbooks. The Antifederalists became in retrospect “men of little faith .“ 24 Only in recent years have the Antifederalists been taken seriously as political thinkers. 25 Biblically speaking, the appeal to the people to ratify the Consti- tution was either an act of covenant renewal or it was an act of covenant creation. There is no doubt which the Convention had in mind: the latter. This is clear from the debates in the Convention, the ratifying conventions, and The Federalist. They recognized that a new govern- ment was being established. To ratify the Constitution was an act of discontinui~. It was a revolt against existing judicial authority. Patter- son of New Jersey admitted this in the Convention: “If the con- federacy was radically wrong, let us return to our States, and obtain larger powers, not assume them for ourselves.”26 23.

Were the leaders of the Convention Christians? After all, many of them belonged to churches. M. E. Bradford concludes that 50 of the 55 attendees were Christians, as determined by church membership. 27 The answer to the question, however, is not resolved simply by an ap- peal to church membership. As Margaret Jacob remarks regarding members of the subversive Knights of Jubilation, a freethiriking, pan- theistic Dutch secret society of the first half of the eighteenth century, its members maintained church membership in Calvinist Wa.lloon28 congregations throughout their lives. “The churches gave them a social identity and the hint of irreligion would have destroyed their reputa- tions and probably their businesses.”29 We therefore need to examine in greater detail the religious opinions of three of the most famous of the Framers: Washington, Franklin, and Madison. 30 George Wahington Washington was a member of the Anglican Church all his life. Officially, he was a communicant member, but he never took com- munion, even though his wife did. He would rise and leave the church as soon as communion was about to be served. When challenged publicly about this by the rector of Christ Church in Philadelphia, Bishop William White, he later apologized indirectly by way of a U.S. Senator, and promised never again to attend the church on communion day, a promise that he apparently kept. 31 Dr. James Abercrombie had been assistant rector of Christ Church during Washington’s Presidency, and he did not mince words in an 1831 statement: “That Washington was a professing Christian is evident from his regular attendance in our church; but, Sir, I cannot con- sider any man a real Christian who uniformly disregards an or- dinance so solemnly enjoined by the divine Author of our holy reli- gion, and considered as a challenge to divine grace.”32 27.

The institutional problem here was the unwillingness of church authorities to apply formal church sanctions. Any church member who refuses to take communion has thereby excommuni- cated himself. A refusal to take communion or a prohibition against one’s taking communion is what excommunication means. Self- excommunication is excommunication, ~“ust as xure~ as suicide is jirst-degree murder. Nevertheless, the churches to which Washington belonged did not take official action against him by either requiring him to take communion or by publicly excommunicating him. It was this disciplinary failure on the part of these churches that led to the pub- lic legitimizing of Washington as a Christian. This failure later in- directly legitimized the Constitution that he conspired to impose on the nation. Without Washington’s support of the actions of the Con- vention, the Constitution would never have been ratified. But Wash- ington was deemed either too powerful or too sacrosanct to bring under church discipline. A failure of sanctions here, at the heart of the church’s sanc- tioning process, the communion table, reveals the extent to which eighteenth-century Christianity had abandoned the very concept of sanctions. This ecclesiastical failure was reflected in the colonial political order throughout the period, but especially after the ratifi- cation of the Constitution. The churches were subsequently brought under a new kind of discipline: formal removal of Christianity from the national civil covenant by means of the Constitutional prohibi- tion of religious test oaths. The churches reaped what ~ey had sown. They had refused to impose God’s negative ecclesiastical cove- nant sanctions; thus, God imposed His negative sanctions on them. This was the lesson of the Book of Judges, one repeated throughout church history. Jordan is correct: Where there is compromise with sin, the very sin becomes the means God uses to chastise His chil- dren. Our sins become our scourges.”3s The sin of our day, as he points out, is Baalistic pluralism. 34 There is very little evidence in Washington’s public communi- cations that he accepted the doctrine of the Trinity.

His written replies to them were generous. He never wavered in his at- tachment to Masonry.

This indicates the degree of the orthodox theological commitment of the Framers. Second, we do indeed need to ask: Was Franklin capable of hypocrisy? He surely was capable of looking the other way while treason was being committed under his nose. Throughout his tenure in France as the senior American representa- tive in Paris, he hired known British spies to serve on his staff, despite repeated warnings that they were spies. Furthermore, in his work in Paris to negotiate the peace treaty between England and the colonies, he steadfastly objected to the insistence of his superiors that the colonies be granted formal independence by the treaty.’4 When Professor Cecil Currey, who had devoted most of his aca- demic career in studying Franklin, and who had previously been considered a well-informed Franklin scholar, 65 wrote his expos6 of 60.

That dream was the creation of a secular republic. 69 He had spent an extra year in post-graduate study with Witherspoon studying Hebrew, ethics, and theology, 70 so he knew what Christianity is. He wanted no part of an explicitly Christian republic. (Neither did Witherspoon.) He worked hard to see to it that such a republic, which existed at the state level under the Articles of Confederation, would not survive. “He was a guiding force behind the’ Mount Vernon Conference (1785) and the subse- quent Annapolis Convention (1786), where with other ‘choice spirits’ he planned out the set of maneuvers which finally led to the Great Convention in Philadelphia the following May.”71 (Bradford’s refer- ence to the Mount Vernon conference is one of the few I have come across.

As we shall see in Chapter 9, what had long motivated him was his commitment to remove the re- ligious test oath from Virginia politics and then national politics. He achieved both of these goals within a three-year period, 1786-88. Madison is often called the “Father of the Constitution.” Intellec- tually speaking, it was John Adams, the American ambassador in England at the time of the Convention, who was an equally domi- nant figure at the Convention because of his detailed studies of the state constitutions, especially his pre-Convention, three-volume work, Defense of the Constitutions of the Government of the United States. His model of the “balanced constitution” was an important influence at Philadelphia. 72 Nevertheless, it was surely Madison who was the father of the Convention, with Washington sitting silently as the godfather. It was Madison who, more than ahy other man, broke the national covenant with God. Conspiracy Arrant hypocrisy?, Rushdoony asks rhetorically. Not at all. Arrant conspiracy. These men were conspirators. The Articles of Confedera- tion had stated clearly that “No two or more states shall enter into any treaty, confederation or alliance whatever between them, with- out the consentof the united states in congress assembled, specifying absolutely the purposes for which the same is to be entered into, and how long it shall continue” (Article VI). This is why the conspirators tried to surround the proposed Constitution with an air of legality by stating in the Preamble: U . . . in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice,” etc. The specified time limit was perpet- ual: “. . ; to secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Pos- terity. . . .” But Congress had not authorized any such treaty, con- federation or alliance. The conspirators knew it, especially the man who made the coup possible, George Washington. “More than most men,” comments Garry Wills, “he showed an early and unblinking awareness that the Philadelphia convention would engage in acts not only ‘irregular’ or extralegal, but very likely illegal. John Jay had alerted him to this problem as early as January.”73 Jay’s fears were 72. Gordon S.

On March 10, Washington wrote to Jay: “In strict propriety a Conven- tion so holden may not be legal.”7q But they proceeded. They knew the whole thing was illegal, a subversive act of revo- lution. They were lawyers, and they had read their Blackstone. 75 Blackstone had commented on the convention-parliament that had called William 111 to the throne in 1688-89. It had been legal, he said, only because James II had abdicated. (Blackstone failed to mention the less-than-voluntary circumstances of the king’s depar- ture. ) Blackstone wrote: “The vacancy of the throne was precedent to their meeting without any royal summons, not a consequence of it. They did not assemble without writ, and then make the throne vacant; but the throne being previously vacant by the king’s abdica- tion, they assembled without writ, as they must do if they assembled at all. Had the throne been full, their meeting would not have been regular; but, as it was empty, such meeting became absolutely neces- sary.”7b The “throne” was occupied in 1787; Congress had not abdi- cated. The Convention had been issued writs; these writs expressly prohibited the substitution of a new constitutional document. Those who came to Philadelphia for any other purpose were conspirators. Yet most of those who came arrived in Philadelphia with the death sentence in their pockets against the existing Confederation and the authorizing Congress. It was this well-organized conspiracy that had control over the institutional levers that made possible the events of the Revolu- tionary War era “that transformed the entire political and social structure of the thirteen colonies in less time than it now takes to send a First Amendment case from appeal to the Supreme Court.”TT The Masonic Connection James D.

No, because men on both sides of the Constitutional debate were found in the lodges, just as evangelical Christians today are in the lodges, despite two centuries of protest from the historic Reformed churches and traditional dispensational leaders .85 Daniel Shays seems to have been a Mason, yet it was his rebellion in Massachu- setts that so frightened the nationalists. 86 What has to be considered in assessing the accuracy of my thesis regarding the Convention is the theological character of the Constitution itself. Was the C onstitu- tion a civil covenant modeled aJong the lines of Masonic theology? Was it closer to the Masonic ideal than the existing state constitu- tions were? In other words, were the terms of ]“udicial and political dis- course shaped by the Masonic wodduiew? It is my contention that Masonry did shape the terms of discourse, translating the near- impersonal mathematical providentialism of Newton’s Creator into the language of the average man.

Carl Van Doren, in his popular biography of Franklin, writes: “Freemasonry in America had been social and local, with little influ- ence in politics.”87 To the extent that any historian even mentions Masonry, which is infrequent, this is the standard view. Masonry was merely “clubbery.”ss But the nagging question remains: What other inter-colonial club had so many leaders during the American Revolution? The textbooks ignore all this. Masonry is seldom discussed as a factor in American history; it appears only in chapters devoted to the Anti-Masonic political party of the 1820’s and 1830’s. This has an- noyed Masonic historians. sg It is a major missing link in early Amer- ican historiography. More than this: it is the missing link. And not just in American historiography. Margaret Jacob has observed a similar lack of interest in the Masonic connections in English history. “Despite the importance of Freemasonry for the Enlightenment, of whatever variety, this originally British institution has received scant attention from British academic historians. . . .

In a specialized monograph on Boston politics during this era, we are treated to one brief, tantalizing reference: “At least eight of the twenty-one members also belonged to the North End Caucus, a private political club which met regularly in several Boston congregations, in both of Boston’s Masonic lodges, the fire companies of several wards, as well as a variety of private clubs.” ’03 But that is all. Even such brief references as these are few and far between. The average student of American history is never told that the Commit- tees of Correspondence and Committees of Safety were very often headed by Masons, held their meetings in lodges or taverns that served as lodge headquarters, and became leaders of the Provincial assemblies. ’04 In Philadelphia in 1775, where the first Continental Congress met, there were approximately one thousand Masons, although we do not know on which side they fell out initially. 105 As the war progressed, the “Ancient” lodges became dominant in Philadelphia. 1°G Bernard Fay The one major exception to this historical blackout by academic historians of - the American Revolution is the French historian Ber- nard Fay.

The lodges were en- joined on both sides of the Atlantic to avoid politics, but they could set up ancillary organizations that could get involved politically. “They were careful to keep politics as much as possible outside the regular meetings of the lodges. . . .

All lodges met in alehouses, inns and taverns; most of them owned their meet- ing places or met in a building which was owned by a member of the lodge.

Robison’s was the first book to gain wide attention on this subject in the colonies. It launched a ma- jor anti-French and anti-Masonic movement, especially among Fed- eralists in New England. 115 In a Postscript to the book, Robison wrote disparagingly of the “frippery,” profligacy, and impiety of Grand Orient Masonry. In contrast, he said, Masonry “has been re- tained in Britain in its original form, simple and unadorned, and the lodges have remained scenes of innocent merriment, or meetings of Charity and Beneficence.” i 16 Webster echoed Robison: “. . . British Masonry, by taking its stand on patriotism and respect for religion, necessarily tends to unite men of all classes and therefore offers a formidable bulwark against the forces of revolution. Any attacks on British Masonry as at present constituted and directed are therefore absolutely opposed to the interests of the country. “117 This was also the attitude of virtu- ally all the American Revolution’s leaders regarding colonial Masonry. Naively, she wrote on the next page: “In the opinion of M. Copin Albancelli, the abolition of the oath would go far to prevent penetra- tion of British Masonry by the secret societies.”118 This was equally true of Grand Orient Masonry. What she failed to grasp is this: the heart of Masony is its oath. It was Masonry’s top-down hierarchical system of bureaucratic author- it y, coupled with its self-valedictory oath of secrecy, obedience, and loyalty, that provided Adam Weishaupt and his Illuminist con- spirators with the organizational system and source of infiltration that they had sought. Weishaupt saw Masonry as an organizational structure that paralleled the tightly knit Jesuit Order that had trained him. No one’s writings have made clearer Weishaupt’s strategy of subversion than Mrs. Webster’s. 119 What Mrs. Webster, like the patriotic colonists of 1776, failed to recognize is that Anglo-Saxon Masonry’s universalist led to the subversion of Christian civiliza- 115.

Subversion by stealth is no less a threat than subversion by rev- olution. Stealth in fact calls less attention to itself. lZIJ Conclusion Colonial Masonry was one of the major components of the American Revolution, and especially of the Constitutional settle- ment. On this point, Rushdoony has remained silent, almost as if he has been afraid to raise the question. ’21 Were he to pursue it, he would find his thesis regarding the Christian roots of the Constitu- tion seriously threatened. I have called the Convention the first stage of a COUP. I have argued that Masonic influence was important both in terms of the philosophy of the delegates and their membership in the lodges. If the entire nation had been Masonic, then this would not have been a COUP. But very few colonists were Masons. Prior to the Revolution- ary War, there were about two hundred lodges in the thirteen col- onies. 122 Their combined membership was somewhere between 1,500 and 5,000. Yet the total population of the nation was about 2.5 mil- lion. By 1800, there were perhaps 16,000 members. 123 Thus, to argue that the Constitution was essentially Masonic is necessarily to argue for a conspiracy. Christians ratified it. They must have been ignorant about the long-term effects of their actions. They must have been unaware of the covenantal implications of their decision. The defenders of the document were able to appeal to a common body of opinion regarding religious freedom and the supposed tyranny of Christian creeds. 1 Z* 120. Cf.

The manifestation of both these new sovereigns appeared within a single generation: the decisions of Federalist Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall and the advent of the Federalist Party-dominated civil service. 125 The conspirators were successful. In retrospect, Americans call them the Founding Fathers. They were surely founders. They sought to give Americans a new inheritance. What they did was to appro- priate an older inheritance in the name of a new family of man. One man had understood this in 1788. We do not know his name. He signed his essay ‘David,” one of the few instances of any author in the debate over the ratification of the Constitution who used a biblical pseudonym. He was a resident of Connecticut, and his comments appeared in the March 7, 1788 issue of the Massachusetts Gazette. He reminded his readers that throughout history, civil gov- ernments had called upon God to defend them. People had long understood the corporate threat of the negative sanctions of God: u . . . it has been generally if not always a fundamental article that moral offences would be punished by the Deity, even if they escaped the laws of human society, unless satisfaction was made to the sover- eign of the universe for the violation of good order.” 126 He also reminded them that the states had always had fast days and other “frequent and publick acknowledgments of our dependence upon the Deity.”127 Speaking of Connecticut, he insisted: “Never did any peo- ple possess a more ardent love of liberty than the people of this state; yet that very love of liberty has induced them to adopt a religious test, which requires all publick officers to be of some Christian, pro- testant persuasion, and to abjure all foreign authority.

This thought disturbed him: the result would be a national civil government based strictly on force: We have now seen what have been the principles generally adopted by mankind, and to what degree they have been adopted in our own state. Before we decide in favour of our practice, let us see what has been the suc- cess of those who have made no publick provision for religion. Unluckily we have only to consult our next neighbors. In consequence of this publick inattention they derive the vast benefit of being able to do whatever they please without any compunction.

If this is the success that attends leaving religion to shift wholly for itself, we shall be at no loss to determine, that it is not more difficult to build an elegant house without tools to work with, than it is to establish a durable government without the publick protection of religion.

It must be that which has adopted the purest moral principles, and which is interwoven in the laws and constitution of our country, and upon which are founded the habits of our people.

That convention, which Madison was instrumental in bringing about, did not conform to the ideal prescription for simu- lating an exercise of constituent power by the people, for the mem- bers were chosen by the state legislatures, not directly by popular vote. But even before the convention met, Madison recognized that it could achieve the objectives he had in mind for it only by appeal- ing to a popular sovereignty not hitherto fully recognized, to the peo- ple of the United States as a whole. They alone could be thought to stand superior to the people of any single state. And what Madison had most directly in view was to overcome the deficiencies of the locally oriented representatives who sat in the state legislatures. To that end he envisioned a genuine national government, resting for its authority, not on the state governments and not even on the peo- ples of the several states considered separately, but on an American people, a people who constituted a separate and superior entity, capa- ble of conveying to a national government an authority that would ne- cessarily impinge on the authority of the state governments. The full implications of what he was going to propose were not at first apparent even to Madison himself.

Every- thing he saw — in the Articles of Confederation, in the state legisla- tures, in the economy — made him angry. He was determined that there would soon be a change. This change would have to be politi- cal and national. He set down his private thoughts in the weeks be- fore the great convention that he had organized, a convention that he had begun planning at the meeting at Mount Vernon two years earlier. He was also determined to achieve his long-term goal of separat- ing Christianity from civil government — not just separating Church from State, but Christianity from civil government. He knew what had to be done in order to accomplish this goal: the severing of the binding power of Trinitarian religious oaths that were required of state officers in several states. Those oaths had to be circumvented. 1.

Thus, Congress itself had to be cir- cumvented, and then overthrown. It was a tribute to Madison’s political genius that he came up with a five-point tactical solution — tactics that matched the five- point model of all covenantalism, point for point. First, the convention would be authorized by a naive and trusting Con- gress to make minor adjustments in the Articles. The old national govern- ment had been the creation of the states. The new one would be the crea- tion of the People. Second, under cover of an implicit oath-bound secrecy, this convention would from the opening gavel violate the instructions of the superior legislative agency, Congress, and propose the abolition of the Articles. This would break the hierarchical chain of command. The convention replaced Congress as the voice of authority. It became the representative of the Peo- ple. This is why it was a convention. Third, the nation’s entire legal order would be reconstituted, including the prohibition of religious oaths at the federal level. New judicial bound- aries assessing relative state and national po~r would be created. New in- ternal judicial boundaries – federalism – would be created for the national government, most notably a nationally elected executive, which the Articles had lacked. Fourth, the convention would appeal to a new sanctioning agency, the People. The will of the People would be voiced judicially in state ratifying conventions that Madison expected the nationalists (a political faction) to dominate. F$th, the ratifying conventions would authorize a new covenant. What was to have been an act of national covenant renewal (revision of the Ar- ticles) would become the cutting of a new national covenant. Subsequent changes (renewals) would be by amendment by Congress and voting by state legislatures, but the door was left open for another Constitutional con- vention, called by the state legislatures or by Congress, with subsequent ra- tification by either state legislatures or by state conventions (Article V).

It was fictional, for it ascribed to one set of elected representatives meeting in con- vention a more popular character, and consequently a greater authority, than every subsequent set of representatives meeting as a legislature. But it was not too fictional to be believed and not so literal as to endanger the effectiveness of government. It never came into use in England, but it was reinvented in the American Revolution. 3 The term “convention” was also used by the revolutionaries in France in September of 1792 to launch the radical phase of the Revo- lution. R. R. Palmer writes: “It was called a convention from the precedent of constitutional conventions in the United States .“4 Under this Convention four months later, Louis XVI was beheaded. This was surely a transfer, of executive power. It led to the rise of a new executive: Robespierre. The Convention then wrote a new con- stitution, later called the stillborn constitution of 1793.5 The centrali- zation of power in Paris escalated under this new constitution. To accomplish this, the Jacobins imitated Madison’s tactic: they had the constitution ratified by plebiscite.6 Madison planned an initial coup – the convention’s immediate scrapping of the Articles — to be followed by a plebiscite. The plebiscite, as the voice of the People, would consolidate and sanction the COUP. Thus, a bloodless revolution could be achieved — a revolu- tion in national sovereignty, testified to by a change in judicial oaths. Had there been no alteration of the oath structure, there would have been no revolution. 2. Edmund S.

Federalist 10 is devoted to this theme. What Madison wanted was political neutrality: a world of politically impotent factions, only as strong as necessary to cancel out each other. In the 1787 “Vices” essay, he inserted this conclusion immediately following the paragraph of state religious oaths: “The great desideratum in Government is such a modification of the sov- ereignty as will render it sufficiently neutral between the different in- terests and factions, to controul one part of the society from invading the rights of another, and at the same time sufficiently controlled it- self, from setting up an interest adverse to that of the whole Society.”7 This was his argument against Montesquieu, who had argued that republics can only function in small nations. On the contrary, argued Madison in Federalist 10, republics can insulate themselves best from the effects of faction by becoming so large that the factions offset themselves. To control the power of any given fac- tion, we must create lots of factions. That he was arguing against Montesquieu in Federalist 10 is generally recognized by historians of the Federalist Papers. What has not been emphasized sufficiently by scholars is the de- nominational context of Madison’s concerns about faction. It was re- ligious faction that was on his mind from the beginning, just as it had been on the minds of the English Whigs for a century. Like the eighteenth-century Whigs’ anticlerical dissent against the Tory- controlled Anglican Church and its political alliance with the crown, s so Madison hoped from the very outbreak of the Revolution to find some way to break up state-established churches. His tactic was to create mutually offsetting denominational factions. He wanted the discontinuity of “sects,” not the continuity of state-supported churches. He said this explicitly in Federalist 51: “In a free govern- ment, this security for civil rights must be the same as for religious rights. It consists in the one case in the multiplicity of interests, and in the other, in the multiplicity of sects. The degree of security in both cases will depend on the number of interests and sects; and this 7. Mind of the Found~, p. 91. 8.

In this sense, he was a consistent secular humanist, and has been correctly iden- tified as such. 12 He railed against the “pride, ignorance, and knavery among the priesthood, and vice and wickedness among the laity.” He then said, “I want again to breathe your free air.”ls In these sen- timents, he revealed himself as a true independent Whig dissenter. Several states had created established churches. Pennsylvania was an exception in 1774 — ‘free air.” Within any one state, a single denomination could gain special powers or favors.

In his Memorial and Remonstrance of 1785, written against the move of Governor Patrick Henry and the legislature to provide limited state aid to churches (not to any one church), ” he wrote: “During almost fifteen cen- turies, has the legal establishment of Christianity been on trial. What have been its fruits? More or less in all places, pride and in- dolence in the Clergy; ignorance and servility in the laity; in both, superstition, bigotry and persecution.” 16 He continued in this vein: What influence in fact have ecclesiastical establishments had on Civil Society? In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of Civil authority; in many instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been seen the guard- ians of the liberties of the people. Rulers who wished to subvert the public lib- erty, may have found an established clergy convenient auxiliaries. A just gov- ernment, instituted to secure & perpetuate it, needs them not.

The doctrine of judicial review — first consistently promoted in the Federalist 25 – coupled with the abolition of religious test oaths, guaranteed the long-term eradication of the pre-Revolutionary War’s concept of oath-created civil covenants under God. One judi- cial body — the Supreme Court — could override the oath-bound “fac- tionalism” of the various state courts. As it has turned out, the Supreme Court can also overturn the decisions of state legislatures and the federal legislature, although this was not fully understood by the authors of the Federalist. Understand what Madison assumed throughout: that religious factions – indeed, all factions – are an essentially surface phenome- non; they disturb an underlying national unity. In other words, there is an inherent unity in man% political afairs apart from factions. All that is needed to allow this underlying political unity to flourish is to ex- pand the geographical boundaries of government in order to absorb (and therefore offset) more and more factions. Implicitly, this is a one-world impulse, a view not shared by the nationalistic Framers. Madison and Rousseau Such an outlook regarding factions makes Madison an implicit follower of Rousseau. It is this assumption of a unitary reality behind factions that undergirds Rousseau’s theory of the General Will. 26 I am not arguing that Madison was a strict follower of Rousseau. Rousseau thought of all of life as political. Intermediary institutions are to have no influence in society at all because all of life is political. Man is a citizen and on~ a citizen. Madison was not politicized to this extent. But the two men were agreed in those cases where the actual exercise of political power was concerned. 25.

Rousseau wanted no factions; Madison wanted the multiplication and political trivialization of factions. The goal in each case was the same: the unification of national policy apart from any meaningful special-interest group pressures. By creating a national government that could act judicially directly on its citizens, the Constitution achieved this Rousseauvian goal. 27 In Federalist 51, Madison described his goal for the creation of this new political order, one which would protect the rights of minorities and also create ethically just government decisions. The key is the diffusion of interests: “Different “interests necessarily exist in different classes of citizens. If a majority be united by a common interest, the rights of the minority will be insecure. There are but two methods of providing against this evil: The one by creating a will in the commu- nity independent of the majority, that is, of the society itselfi the other by comprehending in the society so many separate descriptions of citizens, as will render an unjust combination of a majority of the whole, very improbable, if not impracticable.”28 The first approach is monarchy; the second is the U.S. Constitution. His assumption was that there is justice available, and politicians can discover it; they need only to escape the “noise” of the competing factions. This enables politicians to render just decisions, to escape the tyranny of the majority by finding out what the “just” interests of society are. This was Rousseau’s goal, too. The technique is differ- ent: not the suppression of interests but the privatizing of them, making them politically irrelevant. Rousseau’s goal was the politici- zation of private interests. But both men believed that there is justice attainable through the overcoming of factions. In this sense, Madison was as utopian and as messianic as Rousseau was; the difference lies in his approach. He was a man of the Scottish Enlightenment, a man in revolt against Presbyterianism; Rousseau was a man in revolt against political authoritarianism and the Roman Catholic hierarchy. Each man’s system resembled his enemy’s system. Madison wanted to overcome Presbyterianism by making the world socially Congregational and politics Unitarian; 27.

There is universal agreement among historians: this Madisonian faith in a world of off- setting political factions was utopian in 1788, just as it would be uto- pian today. What few scholars are willing to say forthrightly is that the very presence of such a faith marks Madison as the most ration- alistic of political philosophers. He paid no attention to the realities of politics in constructing the rationale for the Constitutional blue- print. He believed that the Constitution would actually balance real- world politics into oblivion. Patrick Henry’s assessment of the man was on target: “a man of great acquirements, but too theoretical as a politician.”33 Madison and his peers were totally naive on this point, 29.

Madison, alone among the Framers, had “gone the distance” with Newtonianism. In doing so, he became an implicit in- ternationalist. In his political philosophy, the intellectual ideal of a political world of Newtonian mechanisms and the rhetoric of Ciceronian natural law had fused with the Masonic ideal of a creed- overcoming brotherhood to produce a political world immune to men’s passions and interests. It was a stillborn ideal by 1788. Shopkeepers’ Millennium By the time of the Convention, the Framers had begun to think commercially. Adam Smith’s Walth of Nations had begun to move within educated republican circles. The defenders of republican liberties had begun to recognize that the old Roman republican vir- tues, while laudable, were untrustworthy for building a modern na- tion or maintaining an old one successfully. What was needed, they steadily concluded, was something like Adam Smith’s promised shopkeepers’ millennium. Commerce would bind men together in a common effort. 35 Men in their private efforts would produce a good society. 36 There was a fundamental difference between the Framers’ understanding of their self-appointed task and the Scottish Enlight- enment rationalists’ vision of the competitive market order. Adam Ferguson’s observation summarizes the view of the social framework of the Scots: “Nations stumble upon establishments, which are in- deed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design.”37 This was a self-consciously evolutionary worldview. The Framers, in sharp contrast, were motivated by the vision of the Great Architect. They believed that they could sit down together and write an historically unique document that would accomplish for the political order what Smith’s minimal legislation free market 34. Louis I.

Ferguson, as an ordained Presbyterian minister, at least had a liberal Presbyterian view of God to undergird his social evolutionism. Smith had a more Deistic view of God as the founda- tion of morality. He spoke of “the all-seeing Judge of the world, whose eye can never be deceived, and whose judgments can never be perverted.” 38 He believed in final judgment, including negative sanc- tions. 39 He did not appeal to religion merely as an instrumental value for national goals. The Framers were much less clear about such supernatural supports, except insofar as widespread belief in such a God would strengthen social order. With their faith in God as the cosmic Architect of the moral world, by tying the operations of a competitive market order to God’s ultimate design, the Scottish rationalists could offer the suggestion that men can increase their wealth by trimming away most legisla- tion. The world works better when politicians remove themselves from the market. The designing schemes of politicians are the source of the poverty of nations. While Jefferson may have believed in such an economic world — Hamilton surely did not — it took a leap of faith to believe that a Convention could revolutionize civil government by designing a totally new experiment in national government without falling into the trap that the Scots said that politicians always fall into: not seeing the long-term consequences of their actions. The Scots believed in a Grand Architect, but they were of the opinion that a wise politician will leave God’s handiwork alone. The Framers had a different opinion, at least regarding civil government. In modern times, the collapse of faith in any underlying unity apart from either coalitions or the outright abolition of rival factions has destroyed the Madisonian paradigm. Political Unitarianism has been replaced by relativism and the consequent cacophony of single-issue politics. The physical world of Newton has been re- placed by the world of Heisenberg, at least at the subatomic level. The social world of Newtonianism has been replaced by theories of pluralism.

It had its origins in the pamphlets of the Antifederalists who opposed the Constitution. It became popular again in the years im- mediately preceding World War I, when Charles A. Beard published his famous Economic Interpretation of the Constitution (1913). The coup thesis was modified by Merrill Jensen in 1940 – The Articles of Confed- eration — and again in 1950, when he published The New Nation. Jen- sen, unlike Beard, believed that the period of the Articles was not really that critical a period, that the basic economy and political structure of the nation was sound. I am not entirely persuaded by all this; there were tariffs between states, although the tariff wars had begun to fade by 1787. There were debtors such as Daniel Shays who wanted the states to issue more paper money, and states ready to issue it. There was no executive in charge of the armed forces. There was no taxation power at the national level. But Jensen’s assessment of the political division is accurate: Politically the dominating fact of the Confederation Period was the struggle between two groups of leaders to shape the character of the states and judicial branches subservient to them. The members of the colonial aristocracy who became the Patriots, and new men who gained economic power during the Revolution deplored this fact, but they were unable to alter the state constitutions during the 1780’s. Meanwhile they tried per- sistently to strengthen the central government. These men were the nation- alists of the 1780’s. On the other hand the men who were the true federalists believed that the greatest gain of the Revolution was the independence of the several state; and th~ creation of a central government subservient to them. The leaders of this group from the Declaration of Independence to the Conven- tion of 1787 were Samuel Adams, Patrick Henry, Richard Henry Lee, George Clinton, James Warren, Samuel Bryan, George Bryan, Elbridge Gerry, George Mason and a host of less well known but no less important men in each of the states.

There is reasonable evidence that Antifederalist sentiments were held by at least an equal number of citizens in 1788 as those favoring ratifica- tion. 44 Was the victory of the Federalists due to better organization or a better case philosophically? In my view, it was both. In a paradigm shift, those who are creating the new paradigm constantly call to the attention of everyone the fact that the existing paradigm cannot solve major empirical, factual, real-world prob- lems. The defenders of the older paradigm cling to the old system, vainly trying to show that the empirical problems raised by the critics are really not so threatening and are best solved by using the familiar terms of the older system. But as the incongruities between the new facts – meaning either newly observed, recently re-discovered, or newly emphasized facts — and the old paradigm continue to grow, and as younger men tire of putting up with these anomalies, the next generation of leaders shifts its allegiance to the newer paradigm. 45 The young men of the Revolution produced this paradigm shift in 1787. The older political paradigm of the Trinitarian colonial charters was very nearly dead in 1787. Biblical covenantalism at the colon y level had steadily been replaced after 1776 by halfway cove- nantalism; halfway national covenantalism at the national level was then unable to survive the onslaught of apostate national covenant- alism.46 The Federalists successfully portrayed the problems of the late 1780’s as being of crisis-level proportions, an argument denied 44.

In the summer of 1787, most people agreed with the Antifederalists; there was little sense of national crisis, let alone an unsolvable national crisis. 47 The Framers wanted to “seize the mo- ment ,“ even if they had to invent it in order to seize it. (Beware of a media-heralded crisis when there are quiet plans being laid for a Constitutional convention; a moment suitable for seizing maybe in the process of creation.) There was a decided lack of leadership from Congress. Congress in some sense committed suicide by not calling a halt to the Conven- tion when the rule of secrecy was imposed. Some members of Con- gress sat in the Convention; they did not rebel against the oath of secrecy. Clinton Rossiter did not exaggerate when he wrote: “Con- gress was already falling when the Framers gave it their famous push.” 48 The Articles had required unanimity for the ratification of any amendment (Article XIII); this provision had delivered the des- tiny of the national government into the hands of Rhode Island, and Congress knew it. They knew by 1787 that Article XIII was wrong when it stated that “the union shall be perpetual .“ But they did not know how simultaneously to escape both Rhode Island and dissolu- tion. There was a failure both of vision and nerve in Congress. The sanctioned representatives of real-world voters did not have suffi- cient confidence in their own offices to challenge the self-designated representatives of the metaphysical People. The magistrates of the halfway covenant could not muster sufficient drive to defend it suc- cessful y in the face of a more consistent apostate covenant. They had forgotten that God gives His covenanted men confidence only when they obey His revealed law.4g Thus, they meekly acquiesced to the transfer of sovereignty that was going on illegally in their midst, with the connivance of some of their members.

The voters had been embar- rassed by God. The Framers were not embarrassed by Him; they simply prohibited any public oath to Him in their new covenant doc- ument. They regarded Him as some sort of senile Uncle who could be trotted out on holidays, counted on to make a toast or two –judi- cially non-binding, of course — and then be sent back to His retire- ment home. Like the Philistine when they had gained military power in Israel, the Framers did not take God seriously enough to be embarrassed by His presence. The Antifederalists were placed in the unenviable position of saying that there was a need for reform, but not a great need, and not a great reform. Also, they could not show how these reforms could be achieved legally, given the limitations imposed by the Arti- cles. Limited reform on the basis of traditional foundations is always a difficult position to defend after decades of philosophical comprom- ise with those who are pressing for ever-greater social change in terms of ever-greater philosophical consistency. The Antifederalists learned the truth of politics: “You can’t beat something consistent if you don’t offer anything specific.” Philosophically and theologically, the Antifederalists could not and did not match the Federalists with respect to faithful conformity to the ‘spirit of the age.” They could not successfully appeal to the great overarching principle of Newtonian rational coherence, for such coherence pointed to universalist. Newton’s laws applied to the whole universe, even including Rhode Island. In an age of grow- ing universalist, the Antifederalists clung to particularism and localism. For example, they could not deal politically with the inter-colonial economic problems that the Articles had not solved.

The Federalists did: no more inter- nal tariffs, no more provincial fiat money, no more begging for finan- cial support. A national central government would compel economic decentralization. 51 Thus, the Antifederalists could not beat some- thing with nothing, i.e., demonstrate publicly how they could solve the fundamental weaknesses politically with “more of the same .“ The Federalists could appeal to the need for a new union that would abolish these internal restraints on trade. This was the nature of Madison’s vision: political centralization for the sake of economic liberty and decentralization. Hamilton had other ideas, as he proved when he was Secretary of the Tleasury, but this was not known to his colleagues in 1789. Madison even went so far as to hope for an inter- national economic decentralization based on American force. He thought that a strong central government could coerce England into opening up the West Indian ports to U.S. commerce. America would compel the world to accept free trade. 52 This was very far from the vision of the Antifederalists. A Clean Break The Federalists also had made a nearly clean break with the half- way covenant Articles. (It took the Fourteenth Amendment to com- plete it.) The halfway covenant of the Articles was neither openly Christian nor openly secular. Colonial social and political thinkers had steadily abandoned biblical covenantalism for well over a cen- tury. The lawyers had won political control even in formerly Puritan New England; the preachers had grown muddled in offering speci- fics to colonial political leaders after the restoration of Charles 11 in 51.

If the bar- riers to trade can be accomplished individually, nation by nation, fine (what the state politicians could not understand or attain in 1786); if not, then world govern- ment is an alternative.

What the Con- stitutional Convention was all about was this: a national political trans- formation b a group of men who real~ believed in secre~ and oaths.

Church histo- rian Sidney Mead has described this situation well: “. . . the struggles for religious freedom during the last quarter of the eighteenth cen- tury provided the kind of practical issue on which rationalists and sectarian-pietists could and did unite, in spite of underlying theolog- ical differences, in opposition to ‘right wing’ traditionalists .“GS The creation of ‘positive” economic support of specified ecclesiastical groups led politically to the Constitutional destruction of the ex- plicitly Trinitarian judicial foundations of the United States. The federal example reminded men that national leaders were not bound by any Trinitarian oath. Why should state officers be simi- larly bound? The symbol of the oath was real; the covenantal exam- ple could not be ignored.

He was also a member of England’s notorious and debauched Hell Fire Club. 70 In 1734, he was appointed as provincial Masonic Grand Master for the Province of Pennsylvania. 71 He had been seeking a high Masonic position for over a year. In 1754, Franklin had worked to create a national government. This took place at the Albany Convention. This was the first attempt at colonial national union. Some two dozen delegates from seven states attended. The goal was to create a defense system against the French who were challenging British expansion in the Ohio Valley. A committee of five men was appointed to draw up a Plan of Union, and three were Masons: Hutchinson of Massachusetts, Frarddin, and Hopkins of Rhode island. Franklin on May 9, 1754, printed in his ~enn~luania Gazette a woodcut of a snake in eight pieces, labeled ‘Join or Die.” Then he submitted his Plan of Union. Writes Carter: The plan provides for a president-general to be appointed by the Crown, and for a grand council to be elected by the colonial assemblies — the identi- cal plan of organization of American Provincial Grand Lodges at that time. . . . Franklin left no hint that he used the constitution of Free- masonry as a model for his Albany Plan but, since he had published An.der- son.i Constitutions in 1734 and had served as Grand Master of the Provincial Lodge of Pennsylvania also in 1734, there can be no doubt that he was fa- miliar with the Masonic constitution. The fact that he called the council of the representatives of the several colonies a grand council and that the council of the representatives of Masonic lodges is called a Grand Lodge is circumstantial evidence that Masonry was influencing his thinking. 72 Anderson’s Constitutions What was Anderson’s Constitutions?

Several masons’ guilds formed the Premier Grand Lodge of London in 1717.73 Non-masons joined it and immediately captured it. Within three years, the Grand Lodge became the heart of English speculative Masonry, meaning modern Freemasonry. James Anderson, a Presbyterian clergyman and genealogist,74 joined the Premier Grand Lodge in 1720.75 He was also a Fellow of the Royal Society, the presti~ous scientific society, as was his Masonic colleague, Church of England cler~man and scientist John Desaguliers. Desaguliers had been hand-picked by Newton to be the first “experimental scientist” of the Royal Society. The latter became the first paid public lecturer in science history. He had been inducted into the Society in 1714. He and Anderson became the links between Newton, the Royal Society, and Freemasonry. It should not be supposed that they were not self-conscious agents. The Royal Society was not simply some loose association of scientists and philosophers in this era. Newton ran the Royal Society with an iron glove. Writes his biographer, Christiansen: “Newton protected his disciples, advanced their careers, and, in return, de- manded and received total obedience almost to a man.”76 Dr. Lipson concurs: “Newton, whose Philosophise Naturalis Principia Mathematical (1686) 77 epitomized the mathematical work of that century, lived long enough to welcome Anderson and Desaguliers to the fellowship of the Royal Society. Thus the great intellectual revolution of the preceding century was telescoped in the Royal Society into the work of two generations: progenitors and heirs. Among their heirs were the founders of Freemasonry.”7B Anderson wrote the supposedly anonymous Constitutions of Free Ma-sons in 1723.

In the Old Charges we read: “The first charge is this, that you be true to God and Holy Church and use no error or heresy.” J. F. Newton instructs his readers to “Hear now the charge of 1723 ,“ meaning Anderson’s Constitutions. On this point, I agree with Newton: pay close attention. Here is Anderson’s charge: A Mason is obliged by his Tenure, to obey the moral law; and if he rightly understands the Art, he will never be a stupid Atheist nor an irreli- gious Libertine. But though in ancient times Masons were charged in every country to be of the religion of that country or nation, whatever it was, yet it is now thought more expedient only to oblige them to that religion in which all men agree, leaving their particular Opinions to themselves: that is, to be Good men and True, or Men of Honor and Honesty, by whatever Denomination or Persuasion they maybe distinguished; whereby Masonry becomes the Centre of Union and the Means of conciliating true Friendship amen’g persons that must have remained at a perpetuaJ distance. 80 The universalist of the new position is obvious. This is an insti- tutional manifestation of the ecumenical impulse of Newtonianism, which was Socinian and monotheistic. God the Architect was neces- sary to hold the original Newtonian system together; a belief in god the Architect was also necessary to hold Freemasonry together. But, like the god of Newton, this god of Freemasonry was not marked by attributes that are invisible to covenant-breaking rational men, un- like the God of the Bible. Thus, this Masonic god, universal in nature, and manifest only through nature, is to replace men’s less universal, less rational, less mathematical, Trinitarian God. We have in Masonry a manifestation of the Whig ideal of a world in which there is denominational equality through denominational irrelevance; simultaneously, we have an incarnation of the Tory ideal of a world devoid of powerful centrifugal religious forces that lead to revolution and chaos.

This is the theological foundation of political pluralism. It is the revival of the Roman pantheon. All that is missing is political power. That, however, could be taken care of through careful organization outside the official meetings of the fraternity. Like Christians who conducted worship services generally devoid of politics, but who then met together for civic purposes after the worship service had formally ended, so were the Masons. What must be clearly understood is that these men agreed with the sentiments articulated by William Blackstone in his comments on the distinction between natural law and biblical revelation. It is man’s ability to perceive clearly the stipulations of the civil law that supposedly determines which of the two laws is to be regarded as dominant for society.el Blackstone said that biblical revelation is clearer to men, but if he really believed this, then he was John the Baptist crying in the eighteenth century’s Enlightenment wilderness. No one, especially the Framers, took him seriously on this point. The Universalist of Masonry The Christian Church is trans-historical. It carries forward into eternity. It is one in Jesus Ghrist. It is therefore international. But it has, to the present, failed to manifest organizationally both its inter- nationalism and a unified system of courts. Its disputes have repeat- edly led to bloodshed. By the eighteenth century, these religious wars seemed unavoidable unless there was a change in national cove- nants; therefore, a handful of enlightened men sought to base the civil order on something other than the Christian religion. There were precedents for this Enlightenment hope. The devel- opment of economic science in the late seventeenth century was a self-conscious attempt to produce a scientific inquiry of society with- out any appeal to religion. 82 A growing minority of educated men had begun a quest for principles of social order beyond the disputes of revealed religion. So had advocates of a new paganism. Writes Jacob: “In the early eighteenth century, the return to paganism, 81. See Chapter 6, above, pp. 321-23. 82.

Radicals in the 1690s who desired a republican version of the constitution, true religious toleration, social reform, a Parliament ruled by gentle- men in the interest of the people, had to recognise that those goals had been rejected in 1660 at the Restoration.” s3 They asked them- selves: Why had the two English Revolutions failed? Religious con- flict, concluded a radical minority. They concluded that what was needed was a program of reform based on a new ‘religious consen- sus, in a civil and universal religion. . . . “ s4 Freemasonry was the eighteenth-century’s institutional culmination of this quest. 85 Masonry’s principles, like its organizational structure, were “por- table,” to use Dr. Lipson’s term. While I understand that readers have a tendency to skip over lengthy block quotations, I strongly suggest that this temptation be resisted at this point. Writes Dr. Lipson: The first problem on which Freemasonry worked was how a society with an established church could accommodate both a growing religious di- versity and the rationalistic universalist that had attended the growth of the new sciences. The Masonic response was to provide a secret (arcane) pseudo-religion by developing an elaborate mythology and system of rituals for teaching moral values that Masons claimed were universal. The leaders were not unaware of the parallels of Masonry and religion. Churches, how- ever, required uniformity over a wide range of beliefs and values, from the immediate to the ultimate, while Masonry only required fidelity to a gener- ally accepted system of moral values related to daily life. As [Wellins] Calcott reminded his English and American readers [in 1769 and 1772, respectively], in the implicit anticlericalism that pervaded Freemasonic literature, the church’s interpretation of history was one of “enmity and cruelty.” Masonry, on the other hand, was a system of morality based on the will of God and “discoverable to us by the light of reason without the assistance of revelation.” According to the Constitutions, a Mason was obliged “to obey the Moral law,” or the Religion in which all men agree, leaving their particular Opinions to themselves; that is to be good Men and true, or Men of Honour and Honesty, by whatever Denominations or Persuasions they may be dis- 83.

Masonry expressed another kind of universalist, which was not religious but humanistic. BG Masonry is a rival religion to Christianity: universalist in scope, ra- tionalist in its ethics, and internationalist in its institutional goal. Silent M~”orip, Secret Minori~ 1 argue in this book that most Americans were Christians in the eighteenth century. During the American Revolution, especially through army Masonic lodges, a subtle change took place. A small but significant minority within the army adopted rival oaths to those of their churches. This new allegiance fused with a long tradition of republican ideology that had been devised and promoted by the English “Commonwealthmen,” whose theological commitment was not always orthodox. This minority of freethinkers, or at least seri- ously compromised Christians, in the armed forces led to a political transformation of the nation, especially in top national leadership positions. A minority could later subvert the American Christian commonwealth, just as a minority did in revolutionary Europe. The year 1789 was the testamentary year for both revolutions. This proc- ess of subversion had been going on for almost a century, as Jacob says, referring to the career of John Toland, a pantheist and major figure of the “Commonwealthmen”: Most significantly, English radicals like Toland played an essential role in transmitting that originally English form of social behaviour on to the Con- tinent, decades before that process began in earnest. They laid roots that flourished in the period after 1730 when official Freemasonry, that is Masonic lodges affiliated with the Grand Lodge of London, took hold in various European cities and towns. It now seems increasingly clear that from its earliest formation as an international culture, the social world of the Radical Enlightenment, although not necessarily all of its adherents, was Masonic. This milieu reveals a living historical culture where the con- nections between religion, natural philosophy and politics take on a human reality, where ideas about nature, social equality, the new science, as well as the republican ideal produced a new kind of European (few in number to be sure) who worshiped the natural world in a new temple and who found in 86.

But in assessing the force or validity of reforming ideals, then or now, it would be most dis- couraging to rest one’s faith or programme on a mathematical reckoning .87 By the outbreak of the Revolution, there were about 200 lodges in the colonies.as That was a significant number for any inter-colonial association in the 1770’s. By the time of the Constitutional Convention, Freemasonry had become the major inter-colonial organization, rivalled only by the Episcopal Church and the Presbyterian Church.sg Rival Covenant Masonry has always been a rival institution to the Church, despite the fact that church members frequently belong to lodges. Masonry is self-consciously a parallel covenant institution. For ex- ample, Matthew 18:20 reads: “For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.” The follow- ing prayer is attached to the American edition of the Ahiman Rezon: Most high and glorious Lord God, thou art the great architect of heaven and earth, who art the giver of all good gifts and graces, and hast promised that when two or three are gathered together in thy name, thou wilt be in the midst of them: In thy name we assemble and meet together, most humbly beseeching thee to bless us in all our undertakings, that we may know and serve thee aright, that all our doings may tend to thy glory and the salvation of our souls. 90 If this parallelism is the case, then Masonry ought to possess the five-point covenant structure. It does. This was as true in the eighteenth-century as it is today. 1. Transcendence/Presence First, Masonry began with the doctrine of the transcendent 87. Jacob, Radical Enlightenrmmt, p. 156. 88.

This Architect, however, was not the creedal God of the Bible, and therefore not the covenantally divisive God of either the Puritans or the Anglicans. This universalist or ecumen- ism can be seen clearly in the Ahirnan Rezon, the constitutional hand- book of Ancient Masonry. The world’s GREAT ARCHITECT is our su@me Master; and the un- erring rule he has given us, is that by which we work; religious disputes are never suffered within the Lodge; for, as Masons, we only pursue the uni- versal religion, or the religion of nature. This is the centre which unites the most different principles in one sacred band, and brings together those who were most distant from one another.’1 This God was a kind of Kantian “limiting concept” that under- girded the phenomenal realm of cause and effect. This God was a useful hypothesis. He was as impersonal as a mathematical formula. In fact, the Masons regarded the knowledge of God in man to be essentially the same as the knowledge of geometry. 92 God’s manifes- tation in history is in His Masonic brotherhood. Masons in fellow- ship manifest his presence. This quest for God’s presence is why the pantheists could so easily capture existing Masonic lodges and adapt them for their own purposes. 2. Hierarchy/Representation Second, the theory of Masonic hierarchy was very much like that of Puritan congregationalism: a structured assembly of moral equals with ranks in terms of ordination and function. A commoner outside the Masonic hall could be elected Grand Master inside. Buck pri- vates could rule generals. There was a hierarchy, but it was officially egalitarian. It was officially open to all men, not just the elite. More to the point, Masonry was a means by which average men could come into contact with the rich and famous. Unlike real-world churches, which officially possess an egalitarian worldview regarding its members, but whose members seldom display it, Masonry ap- peared to embody this originally Christian ideal, expounded in the Epistle of James: 91.

Masonry was like the early Church in another respect. Like the Church, Masons were forbidden to take other Masons to civil court until the lodge had heard the dispute. The early Church’s prohibi- tion was total (I Cor. 6); it was forbidden to take a brother into civil court. The Masons’ prohibition was partial; it was forbidden until the Masonic court appeals had been exhausted.g3 The fact is, however, that the “craft” was divided by the mid- eighteenth century between “Ancients” (lodges started a generation after the formation of London’s Grand Lodge in 1717) and “Moderns” (which the Grand Lodge called itself). Masonic historian Sidney Morse says that the ‘Ancients” were often lodges of sea-faring men.’ These men were excluded from membership in the Grand Lodge- connected lodges in Boston and Philadelphia because of their inferior social status, so they started lodges of their own. 94 The St. Andrews lodge of Boston, better known as the Green Dragon Tavern lodge, headed by Joseph Warren at the time of the Tea Party affair, was an “Ancient” lodge begun in 1752, the year after the founding of the first “Ancient” lodges in England. The St. Andrews lodge could not settle its continuing dispute with St. John’s, the older Boston lodge, which resented these upstarts. Only with the victory of the Americans in the war and the severing of ties with the Grand Lodge did the origi- nal lodge make peace.95 Thus, the age-old distinctions of status and 93.

The fact that a single negative vote by a member could keep a pro- posed member out also indicates that the lodge system was not all that egalitarian. 96 This Masonic hierarchical structure was gnostic. The Masonic degrees were – or rapidly became – official manifestations of a series of initiations into secret wisdom. This Gnosticism was inherent in its commitment to secrecy. In the Ahimarz Rezon, the constitutional doc- ument of the Ancients, we are told regarding secrecy: “The last qual- ity and virtue I shall mention, as absolutely requisite in those who would be Masons, is that of SECRECY. . . . So great stress is laid upon this particular quality or virtue, that it is enforced among Masons under the strongest penalties and obligations. . . . “97 What was seemingly a vertical hierarchy was in fact concentric. It was this profound impetus to be elevated into a hierarchy by means of access to concentric degrees of illumination that is the key to understanding Masonry and all other illuminist secret societies. Every covenant re- quires a priesthood, whoever the elected Grand Master may be. The priests were those with higher knowledge who could select which of the brethren would be allowed to advance upward, i.e., inward. Masonry became an ideal recruiting ground for future revolutionaries. Masonry cloaks its operations by means of parties and con- viviality. Most of its own members do not suspect that it has ulterior motives, the main one being the substitution of a different covenant from that proclaimed by the Church. But the gnostic organization of its hierarchy — initiation into the “inner circles”gs — is what distin- guishes Masonry from clubs. Masonry can easily become a recruit- ing ground for those who are willing to submit unconditionally to others on the basis of hidden hierarchies. Secret societies, despite possible rhetoric to the contrary, inherently tend to promote institu- tional centralization and rigorous hierarchical obedience. 99 96. “By-Laws or Regulations” (1733), First Lodge, Boston: reprinted in Johnson, Beginnings of Freetna.ronV, p. 104. 97.

Officially, law was Newtonian natural law, accessible to reason. Modern Freemasonry began as a “cult of Newtonian science, “ in the words of Margaret Jacob. 100 Newtonian scientists controlled Freemasonry in London; at least 25 percent of the members of the Royal Society were Masons in the 1720’s, during the period when the society was personally controlled by Newton. 101 The link between the Royal Society and Freemasonry goes back to the very origin of Scottish Freemasonry in England. . The first Englishman to be initiated into this ancient form of Free- masonry was Robert Moray, on May 20, 1641. 10Z He was knighted by King Charles I a year and a half later. His brother William be- came Master of Works, meaning Master of operative masons, im- mediately after the restoration of Charles II in 1660. Among Robert Moray’s associates in the post-1660 period were scientist Christian Huygens and diarist Samuel Pepys. He was a patron of the Invisible College (pre-Royal Society). He was also one of the founders of the Royal Society; Huygens said Moray was its “ SOU I.” 1 0 3 He was the Society’s primary link to the king and his patronage. 104 The Royal Society’s formal, reason-based goal of open scientific investigation, would appear to be in conflict with the inescapable gnostic impulse of Masonry. This is why so few scholars until Fran- cis Yates made the connection. But the links had been there from the beginning. These links are essentially priestly. Mathematics and science, while officially democratic impulses, are in fact far closer to priestly efforts, with membership closed to those who do not under- stand the language of mathematics, just as the Pythagorean priest- hood had been closed on this basis. There is an esoteric aspect of science that is not discussed by standard textbook accounts of the history of science. They do not cite Yates’ findings: 100. Jacob, Radical Enlightenment, p. 120. 101.

Hence it is that we do not know the full content of the minds of early members of the Royal Society unless we take into ac- count the esoteric influences from the Renaissance surviving in their back- ground. Below, or beyond, their normal religious affiliations they would see the Grand Architect of the Universe as an all-embracing religious con- ception which included, and encouraged, the scientific urge to explore the Architect’s work. And this unspoken, or secret, esoteric background was a heritage from the Renaissance, from those traditions of Magia and Cabala, of Hermetic and Hebraic mysticism, which underlay ‘Renaissance Neo- platonism’ as fostered in the Italian Renaissance. 105 The possession of the knowledge of the laws of mathematics had been one of the screening devices Used by operational stonemasonry. Officially, geometry was to serve a similar function in speculative Free- masonry, but the “craft’s” rituals were officially substituted for the specialized knowledge of geometry and building materials. Eighteenth- century Freemasonry was tied to the legend of Hermes Trismegistus, the mythical teacher of the secret mathematical wisdom of ancient Egypt and Greece. 10G The motivation of Freemasonry had been esoteric from at least the 1690’s, 107 and the roots of this esotericism can be traced back to early fifteenth century. 108 It was not sufficient for a Mason to master mathematics and practical physics; a more oc- cult metaphysics was always present. Their rituals testify to this. Modern historians seldom take these rituals seriously. (They take very few rituals seriously, except perhaps a funeral, that most demo- cratic of rituals. ) Ritual may have been fakery and fun at the level of the outer ring, but remove the rituals, and you disembowel Masonry.

(There is another univer- sal language: international money. ) It was this quest for universal laws of nature and society that undergirded speculative Free- masonry. This quest included universal moral law. In the second edi- tion of Anderson’s Constitution (1738), we read: “A Mason is obliged by his tenure to observe the moral law as a true Noachida.” This word Noachida did not appear in the first edition. In the Ahiman Rezon, which follows Anderson’s lead word for word, though not comma for comma, we read: “A Mason is also obliged, by his tenure, to observe the moral law, as a true Noachide.” 110 In a note to this pe- culiar word, we read: “Sons of Noah; the first name for Free- Masons.” The contributor in the lh-yclopaedaia of Freemasonry says that Anderson was not the inventor of the term; it first appeared, he says, in a letter sent by the Grand Lodge of England to the Grand Lodge of Calcutta in 1735.111 One 1877 example of the word appears in the Oxford English Dictionay, but only as an adjective, not a noun. The Noachide is the son of Noah who possesses the knowledge of geometry and also a common morality. Just as the Bible is not needed in order to grasp the logical principles of geometry, so is it not needed to grasp the principles of morality. This originally Masonic word Noachite was used by the translator of the medieval Jewish commentator, Rabbi Moses ben Maimon (“Rambam” or “Maimonides”), to describe the gentile sons of Noah. The Talmud’s concept of the sons of Noah is even more hostile than Masonry to the idea of the need for biblical revelation as the basis of modern civil law. The gentile Noahide, according to at least some of the rabbis, is not supposed to study the Old Testament, especially Old Testament law. If he does, he is deserving of death. Maimonides wrote: a secret. . . . Under its characteristic categories, the secret society must seek to create a sort of life totality. For this reason, it builds round its sharply emphasized purposive content a system of formulas, like a body round a soul, and places both alike under the protection of secrecy, because only thus does it become a harmonious whole in which one part protects the other.” Sociolo~ of Georg Simmel, p. 359. 110.

He should occupy himself with the (study) of the seven commandments only. So too, a heathen who keeps a day of rest, even if it be on a weekday, if he has set it apart as his Sabbath, is deserving of death. It is needless to state that he merits death if he makes a new festival for himself. The general principle is: none is permitted to introduce innovations into religion or devise new commandments. The heathen has the choice between becoming a true proselyte by accepting all the commandments, and adhering to his own religion, neither adding to it nor subtracting anything from it. If there- fore he occupies himself with the study of the Law, or observes a day of rest, or makes any innovation, he is flogged, or otherwise punished and advised that he is deserving of death, but he is not put to death. 112 Sufficient social order within the gentile world is supposedly achieved through their adherence to the seven commandments spe- cifically given to the heathen, meaning gentiles. Six of these laws were first given to Adam, according to Jewish law: the prohibitions against idolatry, blasphemy, murder, adultery, and robbery, plus the command to establish courts of justice. A seventh law was also sup- posedly given to Noah: the prohibition against eating the limb of a living animal. 113 Beyond this minimal list of seven laws, the gentiles – “Noahides” or “Noahites,” the descendants of Noah 114 — are not supposed to go in their inquiry into the ethical requirements of Old Testament law, which belongs exclusively to the Jews. In making this assertion, Maimonides was faithfully following the teaching of the Talmud. He was taking the rabbis at their word: “R. [Rabbi – G. N. ] Johanan said: A heathen who studies the Torah deserves death, for it is written, Moses commanded us a law for an inheritance; it is our inheritance, not theirs.= 115 Resh Lakish (third century, A.

In this, it agrees entirely with rabbinic Judaism regarding gentiles. 118 What is remarkable is that this same idea of a common morality since Noah has been adopted by both modern Reformed theology and modern dispensationalism. 119 This leaves Christians at the mercy of the wisdom of fallen man. By default, it puts the covenant-breaker in charge of society. It im- plicitly denies that God brings His sanctions in history in terms of His Bible-revealed law. This brings us to point four of the covenant model. 4. Oath/Sanctions \\ Here we come to the heart of Masonry: the self-valedictory oath. What circumcision is to the Jew, what baptism is to the Chris- tian, the oath is to the Mason. It is the screening ritual which allows a man access to the ritual meals and libations in Judaism (Passover), Christianity (Holy Communion), and Masonry’s fraternal meals. Here is where the covenantal aspect of Masonry becomes manifest. Of course, this is manifest only to members of the “craft,” These oaths are not published. The Ahiman Rezon, in the section describing the proper means of initiating the apprentice, refers cryptically to “some other ceremonies that cannot be written. . . . “120 Masonic oaths call down judgments on those who would violate the secret terms of the covenant (see below, “Rival Oaths”). But those inside the brotherhood are promised positive sanctions: good connections, protection in civil suits, etc. This is why the Masonic sign or pass- word is supposed to open doors, and it sometimes does. 121 117.

God has authorized only these three monopolies as His covenantal organiza- tions. By requiring self-valedictory oaths for membership, Masonry has set itself up as a rival Church and, in eighteenth-century France and in late nineteenth-century Mexico, as a rival State. In the words of Count Savioli (“Brutus”), a member of Weishaupt’s Illuminate in the late eighteenth century: “The Order must possess the power of life and death in consequence of our Oath; and with propriety, for the same reason, and by the same right, that any government in the world possesses it: For the Order comes in their place, making them unnecessary.”t22 5. Succession/Inheritance Finally, we come to point five of the covenant: continuity or in- heritance. Here is where politics enters the picture. Those inside the organization are promised power outside the organization. Initiation and continued membership are the basis of this inheritance. Those who refuse to examine this “conspiratorial” side of secret societies miss the whole point. Those who see Masonry as “clubbery” miss the point. 123 Clubs are leisure-oriented. They are established for revelry and companionship; secret societies are established to gain power. The goal of the secret society is analogous to the goal stated by Psalm 37:9: “For evildoers shall be cut of f but those that wait upon the L ORD , they shall inherit the earth.” Who will exercise political power in a democracy or a republic? Those who gain the support of those who can communicate with and mobilize the party mechanisms, the media, and then the voters. It is this aspect of Masonry that can be of crucial importance. Those who have been sanctioned by the continuing brotherhood have a great advantage in the transfer of political power. 124 The continuity of the Masonic order provides a means of access to political continuity, even though Masonry is officially nonpolitical. It was not nonpoliti- cal in 1776 or 1789 in the colonies, and not nonpolitical in 1789 in France. 122.

Some criminal secret societies, and even seemingly harmless secret societies, require their members to invoke a self-valedictory oath. This is why they frequently refer to themselves as “families .“ Masons are self-professed brothers, part of an international brotherhood. Theodore Graebner’s book, critical of Freemasonry, A Treatise on Freemasorny, reports that Freemasons require the following oath of their Apprentice Masons: a promise not to reveal any of the secrets of the “craft .“ Kneeling in front of the Grand Master’s pedestal, blindfolded, with a noose placed symbolically around his neck, and the point of a compass pointed at his breast, he says: “To all of this I most solemnly and sincerely promise and swear, with a firm and steadfast resolution to keep and perform the same without any equivocation, mental reservation, or secret evasion of mind whatever, binding myself under no less a penalty than that of having my throat cut across, my tongue torn out by its roots and buried in the rough sands of the sea at low water mark, where the tide ebbs and flows twice in twenty four hours, should I ever knowingly or willingly violate this my solemn oath or obligation as an Entered Apprentice Mason.

How could they? The oaths are secret. As the Encyclopedia of Free- masonry admits, “the conscientious Freemason labors under great dis- advantage. He is at every step restrained by his honor from either the denial or admission of his adversaries in relation to the mysteries of the Craft.”lzs Commenting on these oaths, Rev. Everett De Velde, Jr., con- cludes: “These oaths are a direct breaking of the third command- ment. They take God’s name in vain by connecting His Holy Name with murder.”i2g He is too reserved. Taking such an oath involves violations of the third commandment other than merely linking God’s name with murder. First, the concept of God’s covenant in the Old Testament involved a severing of an animal in two parts. The use of this imagery in an oath taken in a non-Christian secret society is illegitimate. Second, the oath is innately self-valedictory. It calls the judgment of man down upon oneself, if one reveals the secrets of the society. Such a self-valedictory oath is legitimate only when making a covenant with one of God’s three sovereign governments: family, Church, and civil government. / A Separate Kingdom The Masonic leadership unquestionably has long recognized the self-valedictory nature of oaths taken before law courts. To the ex- tent that Masonry comprises a self-proclaimed separate order or kingdom, the oaths given by initiates would have to be regarded by the hierarchy as comparable to oaths sworn before a civil magistrate. In fact, the Masonic oaths would have to supersede a civil oath, for the initiate is prohibited from revealing the details of his “craft” to the 127. “And he said unto him, I am the L ORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chsddees, to give thee this land to inherit it.

And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not” (Gen. 15: 7-10). “And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces. In the same day the L ORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates” (Gen. 15:17-18). 128. “Oath; in En@opaedia of Freemasomy and Its Kindred Sciences, II, p. 522. 129.

The Mason, as an initiate, would face conflicting loyalties when called on by the civil magistrate to reveal details of his “craft .“ Should he reveal secrets to the magistrate or remain faithful to his “craft”? If he takes seriously the terminology of the reported oaths in Masonry, then there would be a strong temptation to refuse to testify and suffer the civil consequences, or else to lie. We would expect to find that Masonic literature would public~ place all oaths on equal par. In secret, of course, this public neutrality would vanish; the key loyalty would have to be to the guild. This publicly revealed position of “equally binding oaths” would tend to weaken the initiate’s commitment to the civil magistrate, leaving him to worry about the vivid verbal terms of Masonry’s self-valedictory oaths. What we find is just such “public neutrality” concerning the equality of all oaths. The oath of the third-degree Mason refers to “so vile and per- jured a wretch as I.” Using this as a guide, we can learn just how well Masonic leaders understand the close relationship between self- maledictory oaths and God’s judgment. Under “perjury,” the Encyclo- pedia of Freem.asomy declares: In the municipal law perjury is defined to be a wilful false swearing to a ma- terial matter, when an oath has been administered by lawful authority. The violation of vows or promissory oaths taken before one who is not legally authorized to administer them, that is to say, one who is not a magistrate, does not in law involve the crime of perjury. Such is the technical definition of the law; but the moral sense of mankind does not assent to such a doc- trine, and considers perjury, as the root of the word indicates, the doing of that which one has sworn not to do, or the omitting to do that which he has sworn to do. The old Remans seem to have taken a sensible view of the crime of perjury. Among them oaths were not often administered, and, in general, a promise made under oath had no more binding power in a court of justice than it would have had without the oath. False swearing was with them a matter of conscience, and the person who was guilty of it was re- sponsible to the Deity alone. The violation of a promise under oath and of one not under such a form was considered alike, and neither was more liable to human punishment than the other. But perjury was not deemed to be without any kind of punishment. Cicero expressed the Roman senti- ment when he said “perjurii poena divina exitium; humana dedecus” — the divine punishment of pe@y is destruction; the human, infamy. Hence every oath was accompanied by an execration, or an appeal to God to punish the swearer should he falsify his oath. . . . Freemasons look in this light on what is called the penal~; it is an invocation of God’s vengeance on him who takes the vow, should he ever violate it;"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"From Coup to Revolution 485 men’s vengeance is confined to the contempt and infamy which the fore- swearer incurs. 130 If the human penalty were merely “contempt and infamy,” then the perjurer would not fear for his property or life. On the other hand, oaths that are self-valedictory with respect to men as well as God are doubly fearful. If Masons do take the oaths described by Graebner, then they have a human sword hanging over them – the imitation covenantal oath — whenever they are tempted to reveal the societ y’s mysteries. The language of the reported oaths is bloody — covenantal~ bloody. There is little doubt that Masonic leaders under- stand what an oath is, as distinguished from a contract, and they re- gard the verbal oaths of their members as oaths in the same way that a magistrate of a kingdom regards an oath in one of the kingdom’s courts of law. An oath places a person under a sovereign, and this sov- ereign possesses power, at the very least, and presumably a degree of authority (legitimacy). It is easy to understand why orthodox Chris- tianity y has been hostile to secret societies over the years. A secret soci- ety sets up a rival kingdom with rival oaths and therefore rival gods. Conclusion Henry Steele Commager has remarked that “The constitutional convention, which has some claim to be the most original political institution of modern times, legalized revolution .”lsl This comes close to the mark, but not dead center. What legalized the revolution were the mini-conventions at the state level. These individual repre- sentative plebiscites sanctioned the coup in Philadelphia, and from that point on, the revolution was secured. Not the American Revo- lution . . . the lawyers’ revolution. The problem with exposing the COUP in Philadelphia is that it was such a successful COUP. Berman regards the American Revolution as one of the six successfid revolutions in Western history. 132 To be a true revolution, he argues, a revolution must be a revolution in law, and it must survive more than a generation; otherwise, it is just a coup. 133 130.

It was a stroke of genius to appeal to the vot- ers in state-wide conventions rather than to existing legislatures. It was a stroke of providence that they succeeded in silencing the one man who might have stopped them: Patrick Henry. Henry knew the whole strategy was illegal. At the Virginia ratifying Convention, he introduced a motion to this effect: the need to consider the details of the original 1786 Annapolis Convention, which had led to the “revi- sion” Convention at Philadelphia. Such a consideration would have reminded the attendees that the whole procedure at Philadelphia had been illegal. His motion: That the act of Assembly appointing deputies to meet at Annapolis to consult from some other states, on the situation of the commerce of the United States – the act of Assembly appointing deputies to meet at Phila- delphia, to revise the Articles of Confederation – and other public papers relative thereto — should be read. To which Edmund Pendleton, President of the Convention, replied: “Mr. “Chairman, we are not to consider whether the federal Conven- tion exceeded their powers. It strikes my mind that this ought not to influence our deliberations.” Henry then withdrew the motion. 134 For all his eloquence at the ratifying convention after that monu- mental but seemingly inconsequential decision to withdraw his motion, Henry never again came close to winning over the Virginia convention — one convention that the nationalists had to win, since it was a large state and the state in which so many of the Framers lived.

This time, there would be no creator-creature distinction: the creator would be the creature. The Framers believed that the time was ripe for announcing this new god, who would offer himself a new covenant for ratification, ratify it, and then turn over all civil authority to his representatives.

I wanted to be sure I had part two cor- rect — what he, following George Mendenhall, calls the historical prologue.

Why not? Because the Constitution literally was announcing the advent of a new covenantal divinity whose prior existence had no independent legal status in American jurisprudence. The People had been referred to time and again in colonial political theory, but the People had no independent legal status. The Unitarian god of Locke and Newton had previously always been mentioned in close association with the god of the People. The People had heretofore always been under a god of some kind. This was about to change. This new independently sovereign divinity, the People, would formally announce its advent as the sole covenantal agent of national incorporation by means of public ratification. The People, the Preamble states, “do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.” The new god of the Constitution was both suzerain and vassal— something covenantally unique in the history of man prior to 1787. The Constitution’s Preamble elevated the People from point two in the couenant structure – representation – to point one: the creator.

The C onstitution’s five parts — with the Preamble as part one (the suzerain) — also conform to the biblical five-point covenant model, though not in the same order. Do I think that the Constitution’s Framers were that self-conscious? Were they the origi- nal discoverers of the covenantal insight that was first, presented by George Mendenhall in 1954? 5 I think not. Were they operating with the biblical model in the back of their minds? Had they stolen the model from the Puritans? No, because the Puritans never systemat- ically articulated their model of the covenant, although they wrote a great deal about all five points. We can find discussions of all five points scattered throughout their writings, but these ‘discussions are not systematical y arranged in the five-point outline. What the Framers did do was write a constitution, and a consti- tution is a covenant document. All covenants must contain or at least deal with the five features of the biblical covenant model. There is no escape. This five-point model is an inescapable concept for every covenant institution. Nevertheless, the fact that the Preamble is struc- tured in the same order as the biblical covenant model is remarkable. In adopting this five-point model, the Framers were being faith- ful to something written by God into man’s mind and his covenantal institutions. They remained true to their self-assigned calling: to create a new national covenant. Authorized by Congress to go to Philadelphia in order to revise and renew the Articles of Confedera- tion – the by-laws of the old national covenant – they substituted a new covenant with a new God. The Preamble was the new Declara- tion of Independence, and the remaining four parts of the Constitu- tion served as the covenant’s by-laws. The Framers also broke the older state covenants by establishing a new one outside of the oath provisions of most of the original cove- nant documents, and against the express intention of the Congress. But they could not beat something with nothing. They offered a new covenant in the name of a new sovereign agent, the People. A New Declaration of Independence This was the Convention’s Declaration of Independence – inde- pendence from the god of Newton. Unlike the Continental Congress’ 5. G. E.

Also unlike the older Declaration, this one would have to be ratified in legally open but well-managed state conventions. This public rati- fication could not be done by representatives of the legislatures, as the original Declaration had been ratified, because unlike the Conti- nental Congress in 1776, the Convention of 1787 had no independent legal status nationally. National status belonged solely to the existing Congress, whose official subordinate agent the Convention was. The Convention broke covenant with Congress when it broke covenant with the Deistic god of the Declaration of Independence. This was the legal meaning of the shift from a halfway national cove- nant to an apostate national covenant. The voters in state conven- tions then ratified the decision of the Convention. In short: new covenant, new god. The representatives of the People in the state conventions then voted to ratify the People’s new-found divinity. They voted to move the People from point two — representative — up to point one: suzerain. In their legal capacity as representatives of the subordinate colonial people, who had previously been legal subordinates to the god of Newton (national covenant) and – in most cases – also the God of the Bible (state covenants), the state conventions declared the corporate People as the sole and exclusive suzerain god of the na- tion. They forgot the example of Herod: And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tpe and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king’s chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nour- 6.

Old and tested ideas, appar- ently, are what Jefferson had handed them. Certainly they did not think they had approved a paper that opened the door to a democratic revolution. They had no awareness that an ‘old god’ had been displaced. . ..” Hawke, A Tramaction of Free Men: The Birth and Course of the Declaration of Inde@ndence (New York: Scribners, 1964), p. 203. Hawke places “old god” in quotation marks.

The worms of humanism have taken longer to do their work, but they have been at their jobs continuously since 1788. From Covenant to Contract? The essence of the shift in the Framers’ thinking appears to be a shift from covenant to contract. This explanation of eighteenth- century political theory is standard in many historical studies. The language of the marketplace was steadily imported into political theory through the concept of the social contract or social covenant. Nevertheless, the covenantal aspect of civil government cannot be evaded. Words can change, explanations can change, formal pro- cedures can change, but covenantalism is an inescapable concept. A covenant is a voluntary contract established under God, and it is then sealed by a self-valedictory oath, either implicit or explicit. The parties to the covenant call down God’s negative sanctions on them- selves should they violate the specified stipulations (laws) of the cove- nant. A contract, on the other hand, is an agreement between two or more parties for attaining specified objectives, the terms of which are enforceable in a court of law. There are no sanctions involved other than those specified by the contractor in the civil law. The motivation of the agreement is personal self-interest or the attainment of some personal goal. God’s name is not lawfully invoked in contracts. 7 This shift in language from covenant to contract accelerated on both sides of the Atlantic after the Glorious Revolution of 1688-89. s 7.

This is what John Wither- spoon forgot in his discussion of oaths and vows. He did not limit use of the oath to the three institutions of Church, State, and family. This destroyed the biblical con- cept of covenantal institutions. The presence of an oath implicitly equalized all other voluntarv institutions with the three covenantal institutions. which in the hands of Madiso~ and the other voluntarists and compact theorists led to the secularization of civil government.

It became popular to speak of a social contract between or among the people, as the sovereign initiators. It is, in Wood’s phrase, “the equation of rulers and ruled.”g Charles Backus declared in a 1788 sermon: “But in America, the Peo- ple have had an opportunity of forming a compact betwixt themselves; from which alone, their rulers derive all their authority to govern.” 10 The heart of the judicial apostasy of the modern world is found here: the shift from the formal biblical covenant to a State-enforced contract, so-called. The State, as the highest court of appeal — short of revolution — became the operational Sovereign of the civil cove- nant, since it was no longer formally covenanted under God. As the human agency with the greatest power, the State steadily has asserted jurisdiction over churches and families. Since the State is regarded as beyond earthly appeal, no other human covenant sup- posedly can be said to have a higher court of appeal than the State. This shift in language – covenant to contract – unleashed the State from its traditional shackles under God and God’s law. Dar- winism later completed the process of emancipation from God and deliverance into the bondage of the State. But Darwinism was sim- ply a working out in the field of biology of the judicial and cove- nantal viewpoint of seventeenth-century Whigs — the philosophers of the voluntary political contract — and the eighteenth-century Scot- tish Enlightenment thinkers — the philosophers of the voluntary eco- nomic contract. 11 Nevertheless, this shift in language is misleading. There is no escape from covenantalism. Covenants are inescapable concepts. Many attempts have been made over the last three centuries to con- vert the three covenantal institutions into contractual ones, but the biblical fact is, men produce broken covenants when they speak of Church, State, and family as merely contractual. Men are self- deceived when they speak this way. There will always be some new 9. Gordon S.

It prob- ably was not clear to those who drafted it, although Madison was very close to the truth. But one thing is clear: the God of the Bible was formally removed from the Constitution. Not even the lingering traces of His name in the Declaration of Independence were allowed to pass into the Constitution. There was nevertheless an incor- porating authority: the People. There would therefore still be a voice in history of this final trans-historical authority. There have been several claimants for this title, but in this century, one has triumphed: the Supreme Court. The Voice of Authority We have seen who the official authority is.

But the Framers took great care to make certain that voters perceived the Constitution as the work of the people as a whole, even though it was ratified by state ratifying conventions. The Conven- tion in drawing up the Constitution was supposedly acting in the name of the sovereign People, as distinguished from the voters’ legis- latures, thereby gaining legitimacy for a revolution against the states-established Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation. They were determined to gain legitimacy for the Constitution from a trans-historical sovereign in a one-time event that would be difficult to duplicate. Once the People had spoken in the ratifiing conventions, they were collectively to go on a perma- nent vacation, as the textbook god of the Deists was supposed to do. Unlike children, who were to be seen but not heard, the People were to be neither seen nor heard after 1788. 12.

The People, as the incorporating God, were to bless the completed work of the Framers, and then go very far away. The nationalists had the Bill of Rights forced on them by the Anti- federalists, but this was the last time any wholesale imposition on the Constitution was to take place. The People were then to sit down and shut up. In acknowledging the original judicial sovereignty of the People, the Constitution greatly augmented the political sovereignty of the Nation-State, which is the only incorporated institution in society that has been officially produced by the people as a whole, The Framers fully understood that the Constitution’s transfer of judicial authority from the People to the national government was a unique act of in- corporation, and it would be very difficult to duplicate in the future. They wanted it this way. Madison flatly rejected Jefferson’s assertion that it is a good idea to go to the people whenever there is any encroach- ment of one department of government on another. Madison appealed to the power of the People almost as if it were a one-time event.

This inference is unavoidable .“” The act of incorporation was a unique event, unlikely to be re- peated, Madison believed. Thus, while voters could reject candi- dates for public office, it was unlikely that they could reject the Con- stitution itself. The states could, however, fight a civil war when major disagreements arose, a possibility he prudently declined to discuss. Thus, the new national government was virtually secure, short of civil war or invasion. Its very judicial security transferred unprecedented political sovereign y to the national government. A New Theo~ of Constitutions Madison’s view of the future represented a break with the Whig theory of the origin and fate of constitutions. The Whigs, in turning to classical political models, were drawn into the classical world’s cyclical theory of history. Cyclical history had been rediscovered by the Enlightenment humanists of eighteenth-century America, and it had become widespread. 1s The Whigs believed, as the Greeks had, that new orders inevitably decline. Hesiod said in the Works and Day~ (eighth century B.C) that the original age of gold degenerated into silver, then into bronze, then into the age of the heroes, and finally into iron. 19 Society, the classical world believed, needs periodic revo- lutions to restore new orders; this idea became common in Whig political philosophy.zo Jefferson had reworked Tertullian’s comment that the blood of martyrs is the seed of the Church, turning it into the blood of patriots and tyrants refreshing the tree of liberty every twenty years21 — a classical, cyclical concept of development. This perspective is reflected in the Virginia constitution of 1776, which 17.

They wanted linear history, not cyclical. They hoped that constitutional balance would give them this providential fruit of Christianity, but without the theological or covenantal root. The Federalists had cried “crisis” in 1787, even as the Whigs of 1688 had done; and like the vic- torious Whigs of 1688, thereafter they wanted consolidation, stabil- ity, and continuity. They wanted the orderly, constitutional transfer of power and liberty to their posterit y. They became “court Whigs ,“ 23 once they had created the new national court. This permanent transfer of political sovereignty to the national State was not obvious at first, even to the Framers. The political boundaries were vague, as is testified to by Madison and Jefferson’s Virginia and Kentucky Resolves in 1798 and 1799, written to protest the Federalist Party’s Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798.24 They had in- vented the People.

Divine Right, Closed Universe Henry could not overcome Americans’ commitment to a new theology, the theology of the divine right of the invisible People. This theology had now replaced the divine right of kings and the divine right of Parliament. There could ultimately be no appeal beyond the sovereign will of the voters. The People as a collective unit are best represented by the voters. The People collectively are originally sov- ereign; hence, the voters are intermittently sovereign. Men can build in institutional safeguards against the misuse of this authority — the Constitution is full of them — but ultimately the voters are sov- ereign. The People speak through the voters. This was why the Con- vention appealed to a plebiscite of voters, state by state, not as they were legally represented in the established legislatures, but in state- wide conventions — mini-conventions modeled along the lines of the Philadelphia Convention, and equally controlled by the same na- tional political faction.

Men had long debated over who held lawful claim to be God’s final earthly authority, but there had been no doubt that this final earthly authority was under God.

This is the essence of the divine-rights philosophy: a final, wz.itay court of earthly appeal. But in this case, there is no heavenly court of transcendent appeal. This doctrine of the closed universe is the essence of humanism, as Rushdoony pointed out in 1967: Humanistic law, moreover, is inescapably totalitarian law. Humanism, as a logical development of evolutionary theory, holds fundamentally to a concept of an evolving universe. This is held to be an “open universe,” whereas Biblical Christianity, because of its faith in the triune God and His eternal decree, is said to be a faith in a “closed universe .“ This terminology not only intends to prejudice the case; it reverses reality. The universe of evolutionism and humanism is a closed universe. There is no law, no ap- peal, no higher order, beyond and above the universe. Instead of an open window upwards, there is a closed cosmos. There is thus no ultimate law and decree beyond man and the universe. Man’s law is therefore beyond criticism except by man. In practice, this means that the positive law of the state is absolute law. The state is the most powerful and most highly organ- ized expression of humanistic man, and the state is the form and expression of humanistic law. Because there is no higher law of God as judge over the universe, over every human order, the law of the state is a closed system of law. There is no appeal beyond it. Man has no “right ,“ no realm of justice, no source of law beyond the state, to which man can appeal against the state. Humanism therefore imprisons man within the closed world of the state and the closed universe of the evolutionary scheme. 28 The Darwinian philosophy of law that has dominated American legal theory since at least O. W. Holmes, Jr.’s The Common Law (1881) had been made judicially enforceable by the Constitution itself. Dar- winian evolutionary thought is consistent with the Preamble. It is naive — I am tempted to say “terminally naive” — to regard the mod- ern evolutionary view of American Constitutional law as being a deviation from the Constitutional settlement; on the contrary, it was guaranteed by that settlement.

Inevitably, the Court’s au- thority expanded, for it can declare the true law which governs all legislation. The Framers believed that Congress would possess the greatest power because it would make the laws. But the biblical covenant model tells us that it is the person who in.ter@ets the law who is sover- eign. The Constitution was written on the assumption that there is a higher law that is sovereign. This was a natural law theory version of biblical law, but it did govern the thinking of the Framers, and the Constitution reflects this belief. 30 Thus, the Supreme Court has at- tained final judicial sovereignty, for it judges the legitimacy of the laws of Congress in terms of the higher law that the Constitution supposedly embodies, and voters are unwilling generally to overturn the Court by Constitutional amendment. The Supreme Court pro- vides retroactive legitimacy to legislation, just as the voters in their ratifying conventions in 1788 provided retroactive legitimacy to the coup of 1787. Five unelected jurors for life, immune from the retroac- tive vengeance of voters, now speak finally in the name of the sover- 29. As Constitutional scholar and historian Forrest McDonald points out, Con- gress was originally the most powerful branch, with the Supreme Court the weakest. (Hamilton certainly believed this to be the case: Federalist 78.) McDonald says that the Court’s power to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional was exercised only twice prior to the Civil War, “and on both occasions the ferocity of the ensuing oppo- sition caused the justices to fear, with some reason, that the court system would be emasculated if not destroyed.” McDonald, “Interpreting the Constitution: Judges- versus History,” The John M, Olin Lectures on the Bicentmnial of the US.

No wonder, in the words of Forrest McDonald regard- ing public opinion in 1787, that “few Americans except lawyers trusted a truly independent judiciary.”31 Political conservatives cry out against the concentration of power in the hands of the Supreme Court. 32 Such complaining does little good. Others have called the Court’s authority judicial tyranny. 33 This also does little good. The Court’s power is still unchecked be- cause of public opinion. The voters really do regard the Supreme Court as sacrosanct. Conservatives for a generation have appealed to the Constitution’s explicit language and point to the obvious fact that the Framers expected Congress to be the dominant branch. 34 Such appeals are futile. They do no good. The Court’s authority is untouched by such appeals. What the Framers may have expected or wanted is here judicially irrelevant; it is the structure of the Con- stitution’s underlying and fundamental principle of~”udicial declaration that is crucial. Legislation Through Declaration The Court is the legislator, for it declares the “true” law of the land, and voters perceive it as possessing the legitimacy to do this. Chief Justice John Marshall’s doctrine of implied powers was a cor- rect view of the Constitution .35 These powers are implied by the very structure of all covenantalism. The earthly judge who declares the true law and applies it to specific circumstances is the earthly sover- eign. He who declares the unchanging moral law in individual cases — the casuist – is the true lawmaker. So is he who declares the evolving amoral law. Chief Justice Burger has set forth this position clearly: “The cornerstone of our constitutional history and system remains the firm adherence of the Supreme Court to the Marbury principle of judicial review that ‘someone must decide’ what the Constitution means.”3G Cornerstone, indeed! 31.

That the Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren produced what Professor Alexander Bickel called a web of subjectivity 37 should surprise no one. This web of subjectivity is the inevitable product of a combining of two doc- trines: the biblical doctrine of hierarchical representation and the Darwinian doctrine of the autonomy of man in a world of ceaseless flux. The mythical “higher law” of natural law theory was erased from modern man’s thinking by Darwin, as Rushdoony noted in 1969. 3s This left the Voice of the People in control. This voice in the United States is the latest pronouncement of the civil agency beyond which there is no judicial appeal: the Supreme Court. Point Two of the Covenant Hierarchy is the second point of the biblical covenant model. It is the section that deals with representation. Some office, agency, or in- dividual must represent the people before the throne of God and God before the people. In the church, this is the local pastor or eld- ers. In denominations, it will be the General Assembly, or in some cases, the Synods or Presbyteries acting as a constitutional unit. But the agency, commission, or person with the authority to issue a bind- ing judgment on disputed cases is the jinal earth~ authori~ for that sphere of covenantal human government. In the U.S. government, this clearly is the Supreme Court. There is no escape from the principle of judicial authority. There must always be a final earthly court of appeal. It can in theory be a plural voice, however: legislature, court, and executive combined, or any two of them. In the twentieth century, the U.S. Supreme Court has become America’s final court of appeal. Five justices speak for the invisible People through the judicially flexible words of the Constitution. The Framers did not recognize this possibility. They did not even bother to stipulate how many Supreme Court jus- tices there should be. They did not understand point two of biblical covenantalism, although the Constitution is structured in terms of 37. Alexander M.

The only way that they could have overcome this transfer of ulti- mate sovereignty to the Supreme Court would have been through the creation of some sort of institutional appeals structure beyond the Court. If, for instance, the Court’s declaration that a law is unconstitutional could be constitutionally overturned by a vote of three-quarters of both houses of Congress plus the signature of the President, a truly federal system of checks and balances would now exist. 39 Instead, the Constitution lodges theoretical judicial authority in the People, and final practical authority in the hands of five people: a five-to- four decision of the Court.

The Court had reversed itself in 143 cases by 1972.41 Of this total, all but seven instances came after the Civil War. 42 All but 28 came after 1913.43 Over half have come since 1941.44 This process has been accelerating. The element ofjudicial discontinuity has now begun to undermine the concept of the Constitution as fundamental law, as covenant. Legal scholars have all but abandoned such a view of the Constitution. Respect for the intentions of the Framers, respect for the idea that the document’s language is perpetually binding, and respect for the idea of binding judicial precedent are now all but gone. This loss of faith has undermined the very concept of Constitutional legitimacy. 45 But without faith in legitimacy to undergird a legal s ys- tem, self-government becomes anarchy, and the State asserts its will in the name of power alone. Like the Persian kings of old, whose word was law, but only for as long as their power could enforce their word, so is the modern State when the public’s confidence in its judi- cial legitimacy wanes in response to the assertions of what Glazer has called the imperial judiciary.4G The doctrine of judicial review was the only available alternative to the idea of continuing plebiscites. Until the Civil War, the Supreme Court reigned but did not rule. It only asserted its author- ity to declare a law unconstitutional twice. But as its arrogance has increased, and it has attempted to rule, it has become the ever- changing plebiscite that the Framers feared. But it is a plebiscite of a majority of nine rather than a majority of the voting public. The Constitutionally unavoidable doctrine of the Court’s legitimate rep- resentation cannot survive the public’s loss of faith in the existence of a stable, permanent, fundamental law which is being represented by the Court.

The idea of the legitimate earthly sovereignty of the Court cannot be maintained once the public loses faith in the heavenly origin of the law. In short, the incorporation of legz”timate earthly sovereignty was destroyed by the voters in 1788 when they ratified the Constitution, with its denial of the legitimacy of a covenantal oath to the cove- nantal God who alone is the source of all law. Here is what is most significant covenantally about the Constitution, and therefore most significant overall. It abandoned the source of legitimacy, the Creator. The state constitutions on the whole were explicitly Chris- tian. The Constitution was explicitly non-Christian: Article VI, Clause III on official federal oaths. The language of natural law in the Declaration, the absence of any religious test oath in the Articles, and the concept of the religiously neutral civil compact in the Consti- tution, began the formal judicial break nationally with Christianity. The Fourteenth Amendment completed it. Then came Darwinism. We can accurately date the coming of widespread unbelief in the United States: 1865-90. 47 With the rapid philosophical erosion of the traditional eighteenth-century world- view, the long-term covenantal basis of U. S. Constitutional law was undermined — I believe permanently. The Antifederalists’ Warning Patrick Henry was one of the few critics who sensed the danger. 48 As mentioned earlier, Hamilton went so far as to say that “the judici- ary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power: and he assured his readers that “it can never attack with suc- 47.

It is one of the strangest ironies of American history that Chief Justice John Marshall, the man who first declared openly the doctrine of judicial review in Mar- bwy v. Madison (1803), was appointed Chief Justice by Adams in the fall of 1800. His predecessor, Oliver Ellsworth, had as a U.S. Senator written the Judiciary Act of 1789, which permitted the Court to overturn acts of state courts and legislatures. He later became Supreme Court Chief Justice. He resigned in time for outgoing Presi- dent John Adams to appoint John Marshall to the position. Had Ellsworth waited just a few weeks before resigning, the likely nominee by Jefferson would have been Spencer Roane, Henry’s son-in-law, who was a defender of the state’s rights posi- tion.

At least some of the Antifederalists saw what was coming. “The weakening of the place of the jury, the provision for a complete system of national courts, the extensive jurisdiction of the national judiciary, the provision for appeal to the Supreme Court on ques- tions of fact as well as law, and the supremacy of the Constitution and the laws and treaties made thereunder all seemed to give enor- mous power over the daily concerns of men to a small group of irre- sponsible judges.”50 Storing then cites “Brutus,” whose Antifederalist writings he regards as the best regarding the federal judiciary.51 “Brutus” prophesied that “the supreme court under this constitution would be exalted above all other power in the government, and sub- ject to no controul. fi 52 He forecast clearly what subsequently has taken place: The power of this court is in many cases superior to that of the legisla- ture. I have shewed, in a former paper, that this court will be authorised to decide upon the meaning of the constitution, and that, not only according to the natural and ob[vious] meaning of the words, but also according to the spirit and intention of it. In the exercise of this power they will not be subordinate to, but above the legislature. For all the departments of this government will receive their powers, so far as they are expressed in the constitution, from the people immediately, who are the source of power. The legislature can only exercise such powers as are given them by the con- stitution, they cannot assume any of the rights annexed to the judicial, for this plain reason, that the same authority which vested the legislature with their powers, vested the judicial with theirs – both are derived from the same source, both therefore are equally valid, and the judicial hold their powers independently of the legislature, as the legislature do of the judicial. – The supreme tort then have a right, independent of the legisla- ture, to give a construction to the constitution and every part of it, and there is no power provided in this system to correct their construction or do it away. If, therefore, the legislature pass any laws, inconsistent with the sense the judges put upon the constitution, they will declare it void; and therefore in this respect their power is superior to that of the legislature.

Over time, the Supreme Court gained sufficient legitimacy – legitimacy by default – to monopolize this sovereign power of judicial review, especially after the Civil War. Scholars properly regard as a Constitutional aberration Presi- dent Andrew Jackson’s decision to ignore the Supreme Court’s deci- sions in Cherokee Nation u. Georgia (1831) and Wbrchester u. Georgia (1832), which defended the Indians’ tribal lands from encroachment by the state of Georgia. 55 The President was not impeached for his decision, nor did anyone in Congress suggest that he should be. The fact remains that this is the only peacetime example in U.S. history of a President’s successfully denying the authority of the Court. The authority of the Court was established implicitly because of the structure of the biblical covenant, which the Constitution imitates. Fundamental Law The Framers regarded the Constitution as fundamental law. This, Paul Eidelberg argues persuasively, is the foundation of the concept of judicial review. 56 Article VI, Clause 2 states that “This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereofi and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State to the Contrary notwith- standing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary not withstanding.” But a fundamental law needs a fundamental in- terpreter, a fimdamental casuist, a final earthly court of appeal. Some- one must speak representative~ for the sovereign source of law. This is the U.S. Supreme Court. It was not intended to be so by the Framers, but it has become so. As the Massachusetts Bay Colony’s General Court became the legislature, so has the modern Supreme Court be- come the legislature. The difference is, the Puritans of New England acknowledged the transformation and made this court elective. The Constitution is a covenant, Eidelberg correctly observes, ‘for this term denotes its juridical basis as a permanent law.”57 If the people are the true source of law, as the Constitution states in the 55.

But continual plebiscites would de- stroy the concept of permanence — the heart of a covenant. 58 Too much political change, too much political passion, and too many shifting majorities will destroy the very idea of a covenant. The Framers recognized this, and sought ways to cool public passions. 59 Thus, concludes Eidelberg, the doctrine of judicial review was im- plicit in the Constitution, whether the Framers saw this or not. Appellate Jurisdiction The Framers did inse~ a clause to limit the Court’s authority, but it has been used infrequently and is inherently not in agreement with the spirit of the Constitution: the ability of Congress to remove most issues from the Court’s jurisdiction. All Congress has to do is to pass a resolution removing the Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdic- tion. That would do it. Article III, Section 2, Clause 2, of the Con- stitution reads as follows: In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, and other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be a Party, the Supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. In all other Cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make. There is no mention of the President. Whether he must agree with Congress on this removal of the Court’s appellate jurisdiction has never been decided. An interesting question is: What if the Court were to say that the President must agree with Congress, but Con- gress disagrees? What if Congress should remove the jurisdiction of the Court in this particular area of disagreement? Ex Parte McCaTdle The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction only in cases where ambassadors and consuls are involved, or in cases in which states shall be a party. The Supreme Court ‘has in the past acknowledged this long-neglected judicial fact. Consider the case of Ex Parte McCardle (1868). In the late 1860’s, Congress imposed a military dictatorship 58.

During Reconstruction, a man was con- victed in a military court of certain acts that were deemed by that court as obstructing Reconstruction. The Supreme Court decided to review the case. Here is the analysis of the case from the Library of Congress: Anticipating that the Court might void, or at least undermine, congres- sional reconstruction of the Confederate States, Congress enacted over the President’s veto a provision repealing the act which authorized the appeal McCardle had taken. Although the Court had already heard argument on tie merits, it then dismissed for want to jurisdiction. “We are not at liberty to inquire into the motives of the legislators. We can only examine into its power under the Constitution; and the power to make exceptions to the ap- pellate jurisdiction of this court is given by express words.”a The President had been asked to sign the measure, but the text of the analysis does not say why. The Constitution surely does not mention any such requirement. Perhaps Congress submitted it to President Johnson out of spite; they knew his veto could be over- ridden. In any case, the Court withdrew peacefully. It had no choice. The Constitution is clear, and previous cases had admitted such authority on the part of Congress. Initial Judicial Restraint Obviously, this is a very ticklish subject. Like the principle of ju- dicial review, it was seldom invoked in the early days of the republic. Judicial review is not a principle written into the Constitution. Chief Justice John Marshall invoked it in the famous Marbuy u. Madison > case in 1803 when he declared an Act of Congress unconstitutional. The only other time prior to the Civil War that the Court invoked it was in the Dred Scott u. Sandford case of 1857, which more or less guar- anteed the Civil War. The Court determined that Dred Scott was the property of his southern owner, even though he had been taken into states that did not recognize the lawfulness of chattel slavery. He did not thereby become a citizen, so he could not sue in federal court, the Supreme Court declared. The Court declared that Negroes could not be citizens of the U. S., although they could become state citizens. That decision was overruled at the cost of 600,000 dead. The 14th Amendment (1868) was the result. 60.

In fact, the decrease of such asser- tions of authority has paralleled the increase of the Court’s willing- ness to declare laws unconstitutional. It is clear why: Congress has de- fined authorip to the Supreme Court. A power never announced by the Constitution (judicial review) has triumphed, and a power clearly announced by it — Congress’ control over the Court’s appellate juris- diction – has dropped from the memory of Congress and the vast majority of citizens.

Our Country, if it does justice to itself, will be the workshop of liberty to the Civilized World, and do more than any other for the uncivilized .“65 This was nothing short of messianic. It was also a false prophecy; no nation has ever successfully imported and applied our Constitution. At best, they have imitated our economics, not our political structure. Bellah writes: The men who consciously felt themselves to be “founding fathers” had a profound conviction of the solemnity and significance of their role as law- givers.

The loudly professed moralism was conspicuously vague about details. In short, the moralism of the Framers, like the moralism of the pastors inside the churches, was devoid of casuistry. The Framers had substituted undefined classical virtue for the Great Awakening’s undefined Christian piety; both views were self-consciously opposed to biblical law.

The doctrine of the separation of Church and State be- came in practice subordination of Christianity to the State. While the national government was prohibited by Article VI, Clause 3 from even recognizing the civil government’s dependence on Christi- anity, the churches were expected to become amateur cheerleaders for the Constitution and the State. This they have dutifully done from the beginning. There is no escape from the principle of the civil covenant; the churches have faithfully come to the altar of the empty pantheon to drop its pinch of incense to the genius of the sovereign People. The covenant’s law-order had already been broken by Jonathan Edwards and his emphasis on emotionalism and “sweetness.”c7 The Framers simply worked out judicially what had been accepted mor- ally: the irrelevance of biblical law for civil government. The shat- tered church covenants of the Great Awakening, especially Presby - terianism, like the shattered civil covenants of New England that the Great Awakening produced,a could be restored only by an appeal to the newly emerging civil religion, a religion devoid of biblical law and Trinitarian oaths. For over a century, the Calvinists had talked about the law of God but never the laws of God; they talked moral- ism, not covenantalism. They talked about the moral law of God but not the civil law. (They still do. ) The result was a crabbed theology that did not offer specific standards for social transformation, but surely burdened men with guilt. It was a theology, as Haroutunian has described it, of “a consistent and unlovable legalism.”@ And as he shows, the Unitarian revolt in the 1770’s steadily replaced this crabbed Calvinism in the thinking of intellectual and political lead- ers. 70 Baptized Unitarianism had replaced pietistic Calvinism as an operational social ideal by the late 1780’s. The heirs of the Common- wealthmen replaced the heirs of the holy commonwealth in the seats of authority. 67. Edwards, Treatise on the Reli@ow Affections (1746). 68. Richard L.

He insists that “there is a striking dis- continuity, as regards underlying constitutional theory, between the seventeenth-century charters or compacts and the grounding docu- ments of the Revolution and the Founding. n ’l We can see the differ- ence in the covenanting documents. “The Mayflower Compact, for example, does not suggest a social contract of independent and equal men constituting by consent their own sovereign and representative government for the purpose of the protection of their own liberties and property.”72 They characterized themselves as loyal subjects of King James. Their purpose was twofold: the glory of God and the honor of king and country. The Fundamental Articles of New Haven (1639) asked everyone to assent to the truth that “The Scrip- tures doe hold forth a perfect rule for the direction and government of all men in all duties which they are to perform to God and men as well in the government of famylyes and commonwealths as in mat- ters of the church.”’s After surveying several other early colonial laws, Pangle then states what should be obvious to any Christian historian and any secular historian who has studied the primary source documents of the two eras: These were the constitutional foundations of the first American civil so- cieties, societies that comprised men who believed, and rightly believed, that they were liberating themselves from the oppressions and fanaticisms of the Old World. This was the moral world, or the freest that the moral world could conceive itself as being, before the conceptions of Thomas Hobbes, Benedict Spinoza, and John Locke shattered its foundations. 74 Shatteredfoun&tions: this is the covenantal legacy of the U.

Conclusion The Preamble of the Constitution and the plebiscite of 1788 es- tablished a new covenantal foundation for the American republic. It transferred ultimate sovereignty from God to the People as a whole, and mediatory political sovereignty from the states to the national government. The question then became: Which branch speaks au- thoritatively in the name of the new divinity? While the Framers did not expect the Supreme Court to emerge as the People’s spokesman, it was inherent in the nature of the Constitutional settlement: 1) the inescapable doctrine of judicial review; 2) a unitary reviewer (i. e., no provision for an appeal to the plural sovereignties of President and Congress); 3) lifetime tenure for federal judges (continuity of the spoken word). The lawyers created a civil government made in their own image, and they transferred penultimate sovereignty to the ~awyers’ lawyers,” those sitting permanently on the Supreme Court until they die or voluntarily resign. Only the voters can overcome the Court through the amending process, or so it has appeared. There is no escape from judicial authority. There must always be a final earthly court of appeal. The Framers did not fully recognize this. They should have seen that the Constitutional doctrine of judi- cial review was inevitable. The only way that they could have over- come this transfer of ultimate sovereignty to the Supreme Court would have been the creation of some sort of appeals structure beyond the Court, such as my three-quarter’s vote suggestion. In- stead, the Constitution lodges theoretical judicial authority in the People, and final practical authority in the hands of five people (a five-to-four decision of the Court). The fact is that there must always be a uoice that intmprets the will of the sovereign agent in histoy. Today, the amorphous deity “We the People” is represented in a sovereign way by five people. A Constitutional amendment can override the Court, as can a new Convention, but these alterations are costly to organize and infrequent. The Court not only reigns today; it also rules. 75. Ibid., p. 106."},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"518 POLITICAL POLYTHEISM The remarkable fact is that this development was foreseen clearly by “Brutus.” Analyzing the Preamble, he recognized that a vast ex- pansion of national political power was inevitable: To discover the spirit of the constitution, it is of the first importance to attend to the principal ends and designs it has in view. These are expressed in the preamble, in the following words, viz. “We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution,” &c. If the end of the government is to be learned from these words, which are clearly designed to declare it, it is obvious it has in view every object which is embraced by any government. The preservation of internal peace – the due administration of justice – and to provide for the defence of the community, seems to include all the objects of government; but if they do not, they are certainly comprehended in the words, “to provide for the general welfare.” If it be further considered, that this constitution, if it is ratified, will not be a compact entered into by states, in their corporate capacities, but an agreement of the people of the United States, as one great body politic, no doubt can remain, but that the great end of the constitution, if it is to be collected from the preamble, in which its end is declared, is to constitute a government which is to extend to every case for which any government is instituted, whether external or in- ternal. The courts, therefore, will establish this as a principle in expound- ing the constitution, and will give every part of it such an explanation, as will give latitude to every department under it, to take cognizance of every matter, not only that affects the general and national concerns of the union, but also of such as relate to the administration of private justice, and to reg- ulating the internal and local affairs of the different parts. 76 The means of this centralization of power, he predicted, would be the Supreme Court’s power of judicial review: Perhaps nothing could have been better conceived to facilitate the aboli- tion of the state governments than the constitution of the judicial. They will be able to extend the limits of the general government gradually, and by in- sensible degrees, and to accommodate themselves to the temper of the people. Their decisions on the meaning of the constitution will commonly take place in cases which arise between individuds, with which the public will not be generally acquainted; one adjudication will form a precedent to the next, and this to a following one. These cases will immediately affect indi- viduals only; so that a series of determinations will probably take place be- 76. “Brutus~ Com@ete Anti-Federalist, II, p. 424."},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"‘We the People”: From Vassal to Suzerain to Serf 519 fore even the people will be informed of them.

Had the construction of the constitution been left with the legislature, they would have explained it at their peril; if they exceed their powers, or sought to find, in the spirit of the constitution, more than was expressed in the letter, the people from whom they derived their power could remove them, and do themselves right; and indeed I can see no other remedy that the people can have against their rulers for encroachments of this nature. A constitution is a compact of a people with their rulers; if the rulers break the compact, the people have a right and ought to remove them and do them- selves justice; but in order to enable them to do this with the greater facility, those whom the people chuse at stated periods, should have the power in the last resort to determine the sense of the compact; if they determine con- trary to the understanding of the people, an appeal will lie to the people at the period when the rulers are to be elected, and they will have it in their power to remedy the evil; but when this power is lodged in the hands of men independent of the people, and of their representatives, and who are not, constitutionally, accountable for their opinions, no way is left to con- troul them but with a high hand and an outstretched arm. 77 If America’s national covenant remains broken, the Court will neither reign nor rule forever. In the longer run, there is no question where we are headed: (A Psalm of David.) The L ORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. The L ORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth (Ps. 110:1-3). Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down aJl rule and ail authority and power. For he must reign, till he bath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For he bath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him. And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all (I Cor. 15:24-28). 77.

This was the transcendent re- sult of their labors. It certainly was not understood by the Confederate Congress, or by the legislatures of the commonwealths, or by the public generally, that they were to undertake any such problem.

The new sovereignty, thus legally established, might then be legally and constitutionally appealed to for the adoption of any plan of government which the convention might choose to propose. The convention did not, however, proceed in any such manner. What they actually did, stripped of all fiction and verbiage, was to assume constituent powers, ordain a constitution of government and of liberty, and demand the plebiscite thereon, over the heads of all existing legally organized powers. Had Julius or Napoleon committed these acts they would have been pronounced coup d’6’tat [sic]. Looked at from the side of the people exercising the plebiscite, we term the movement revolution. The convention clothed its acts and as- sumptions in more moderate language than I have used, and professed to follow a more legal course than I have indicated. . . .

What went wrong with the American experiment in Christian freedom? Essentially, the same thing that has been going wrong with Christianity since the early second century: a compromise with false gods. It began in the early Church with the assumption that the false gods of Greek philosophy spoke to man with the same common lan- guage and message that the God of the Bible speaks. This intellec- tual error has continued to undermine all attempts to construct Christian civilization ever since. The idea that there is common ground intellectually with covenant- breakers is really a symptom of a much worse error: the idea that there is common ethical ground between the believer and unbeliever. This is not to say that there is no possible connection. There is. It is based on the fact that all men are made in God’s image. There can therefore be limited cooperation under some historical conditions be- cause of the work of the law written on the hearts of all covenant- breakers (Rem. 2:15). This does not refer to God’s law itself, which is the exclusive heart-engraved possession of Christians (Heb. 8:8-11). 1 1. John Murray, The Epistle to the Remans, 2 vols.

This is the assumption that officially undergirds the common hierarchies, laws, and courts of all modern secular civil governments. It does not matter if, for a time, subordinate civil governments continue to maintain a Christian confession. The covenantal confes- sion of the national civil government inevitably will determine the covenantal confession of the regional civil governments under it. The central government must settle regional disputes and make na- tional policy in terms of a single confession. Regional and local civil governments have agreed to subordinate themselves to a common central government. The god of this central government then be- comes the suzerain of the local governments. The national pantheon may be full or it may be empty; the fact of the matter is, the god of the national covenant is the god of the composite local governments. There is no escape from the five points of the covenant. Things may not appear to be this way when the covenant is first cut, but here is where the system must end up, unless the nation: 1) changes its cove- nant voluntarily, 2) falls militarily to another nation, or 3) breaks apart into smaller jurisdictional units. Two centuries after the United States broke covenant with God, very few American Christians have any idea that this was what took place in 1788. They see the growing evils that surround them, yet they do not even suspect a connection between these events and the events of 1785-89. They do not think in terms of sanctions against covenantal apostasy. They do not think covenantally. James Madison did. So did John Adams. The American Revolution Having a common enemy in 1776, i.e., Great Britain, made it easy for the Christian state commonwealths to forget a biblical cove- nantal requirement: the prohibition of covenants between covenant- 2.

Temporary political and military alliances and confedera- tions with covenant-breakers are legitimate, as the example of Abra- ham shows (Gen. 14:13); civil covenants are not.3 They forgot be- cause the Unitarian religion of Isaac Newton had already success- fully compromised the Trinitarian religion of Jesus Christ. Everyone in colonial America assumed that there are common, God-given (“natural”) laws and rights. Everyone assumed that a public acknowledgment of the sovereignty of the Unitarian god of Newton was the covenantal equivalent of a public acknowledgment of the sovereignty of the Trinitarian God of the Bible. They assumed, as Christian Masons assumed (and still assume), that the Great Architect of the Universe (G. A. O. T. U.) is the Creator God of the Book of Genesis. Thus, when Great Britain became perceived as the common enemy of all the colonies, the patriots of the covenantally Christian states assumed that they could make a military alliance with the states that were not formally covenanted to the God of the Bible, or at least less formally covenanted. They assumed that be- cause the citizens of all the states were Christians, there was no danger in a confederation among the state governments that politi- cally represented these Christian citizens. There was great danger, as events soon proved. There was also the thorn of Rhode Island. The war escalated rapidly, and self-defense appeared to require more than a mere confederation; it required a covenant. The Decla- ration of Independence was more than a statement of the creation of a new alliance; it declared the creation of a new nation of sovereign states. It was a classic halfway covenant. In the words of Lincoln in the Gettysburg Address, it was a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. All men are indeed created equal: equally guilty of transgressing God’s covenant with Adam, equally under the negative sanctions of God. But a new birth is possible by God’s grace: adoption by God through Jesus Christ into the household of God (John 1:12). This makes men covenantally unequal. It creates an eternal distinction between two kinds of people: covenant-keepers and covenant-breakers. These rival judicial conditions must be revealed in radically different 3.

The ques- tion is: By whose covenant? The problem in understanding this judicial screening process is easy to state but hard to comprehend, namely, covenants arej”udicialZy binding under God. He takes them seriously – as seriously as He takes Church covenants and family covenants. The civil and military alliance of the Revolutionary period, from July 4, 1776, until the ra- tification of the Articles by the state legislatures in 1781, was more than an alliance; it was a covenant. The Declaration of Independ- ence was not heralded as a covenantal document, but it was one. It had to be; it formally dissolved the previous civil covenantal ties with Great Britain: ‘When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them. . . .” The sovereign of this new civil covenant was Newton’s Unitarian god of nature. Thus, the next step — establishing the by-laws of a formal covenant — was far easier to take. 4 A Unitarian Rebellion In their act of Unitarian political rebellion, the colonies committed treason, not just against Great Britain, but against God. This is what the heirs of the American Revolution never admit, even in pri- vate. Neither the revolutionaries nor their heirs have taken biblical covenant theology seriously, so the covenantal character of that civil rebellion has simply been ignored for over two centuries. The revolutionary leaders did not clearly and formally appeal to the Trinitarian God of the Bible in defending their rebellion; in- stead, they appealed forthrightly again and again to Newton’s Uni- tarian god. The Congress asked Jefferson to write the covenantal document that formally broke the existing covenant with the King. .Jefferson became their covenantal representative, and therefore the ‘new nation’s representative (point ~wo of the biblical covenant). 4. The Declaration is sometimes referred to as having established the nation’s ‘organic” law. This is the language of philosophical realism, religious pantheism, secular conservatism, and Roman Catholicism. The Declaration was a covenant treaty under a god that bound the formerly subordinate British states into a new ju- dicial union. Covenants are juduial, not organic.

But they chose to have Christianity’s mortal enemy write the nation’s covenant-breaking document. And so John Winthrop’s dream died. There is no neutrali~. There is no neutral legal ground between a civil covenant under one sovereign and a civil covenant under another. A new covenant and a new sovereign is substituted for an earlier covenant and sovereign. To use the language of the Arminian and Deistic social contract theorists, there is never a return to the “state of nature .“ The colonists knew this much, even if they did not understand biblical covenant theology very well. They were neces- sarily creating a new civil covenant when they broke the old one. This is why Congress on July 4 set up a committee to create a na- tional seal. Church and State in 1776 Great Britain had unquestionably become bureaucratic. It was no longer the nation it had once been. But it was still a covenantall y Christian nation. In fact, one of the major resentments that the Prot- estants of the colonies had against Great Britain was that they be- lieved that the Church of England was planning to send a bishop to the colonies, therefore making it much easier to ordain new Anglican pastors here. Previously, candidates for the Anglican ministry had been required to travel to London, where the Bishop of London would consider ordaining them. No one else had this authority. This 5.

The Baptists and Methodists captured the West and thereby the nation for Roger Williams’ commonwealth vision. )6 The colonists suspected that this move by the Anglican Church was an attempt to strengthen Anglican- ism and therefore the English crown, for the King was the head of the Church. 7 Thus, the original Erastian error of Reformation Eng- land – a national church with the civil sovereign as its head – had at last led to a major political crisis. This, too, was an aspect of God’s historic sanctions. When Saul had offered a sacrifice instead of Sam- uel, he violated God’s law (I Sam. 13:9-15). The same was true of Uzziah (II Chr. 22:19). Saul lost his kingdom; Uzziah was stricken with leprosy. George III lost a war and claims to most of a continent Christians all over the world in the mid-eighteenth century still believed that it was necessary for the State to finance the Church. This placed the Church economically under the State to some degree. Christians, then as now, did not understand that the State is a ministry of God for the suppression of evil — a covenant institution which is supposed to impose exclusively negative sanctions. By mak- ing the State into an organization like the family or Church — an in- stitution imposing positive sanctions — Christians created a perverse institution that could masquerade as a blessing. It was a curse in disguise, a wolf in sheep’s clothing. It still is. (Fortunately, it is a nearly bankrupt wolf. )s The Defection of the Pastors A majority of colonial patriot pastors became Whig Common- wealthmen rather than Holy Commonwealthmen during the years of the Revolution.

In 1776, they became chaplains at home and in camp for an army that was under the hierarchical control of a dedicated Mason of great public virtue. They preached their fast-day sermons and their regi- mental sermons just as they had preached election-day sermons since the Indian wars of 1675-76: as anointers of the State. Their messages had been self-consciously devoid of specific biblical judicial content for a century by the time of the Revolutionary War. 10 This did not change, 1776-1788. The pastors had long since deferred politically to the lawyers. The lawyers inherited the kingdom of politics during the American Revolution. They did this ingeniously; in fact, like the rise of the empire in Rome, politics fell into their hands as a by-product of war. The Christians made that most fundamental of foreign policy mistakes: “The enemy of my enemy is my friend.” They made it within each colony when they allowed Unitarians, Deists, and Masons to make the civil case for revolution, and they made it again in the creation of a new nation that was formally subordinate to the Unitarian god of Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Adams. When they broke their state covenants with the English King on the basis of political and economic grievances — the self-interested complaints of the law- yers and the merchants – when in fact they needed to break cove- nant with a morally corrupt Parliament and the Erastian Anglican Church, they broke their covenant with the God of the Bible.

The New Nationalism The language of the laws of nature and nature’s god disappeared from the Constitution. So did the twin doctrines of natural law and natural rights. Historian Cad Becker wrote in 1922: “In the Declara- tion the foundation of the United States is indissolubly associated with a theory of politics, a philosophy of human rights which is valid, if at all, not for Americans only, but for all men. This association gives the Declaration its perennial interest .“12 Yet a few pages later he noted, almost as an aside, that these ideas disappeared in nineteenth- century constitutions. Natural rights are absent, he said, “even where we should perhaps most expect it, in the Constitution of the United States. . . .”13 On the contrary, if my theory of apostate covenantalism is correct, this is exactly where we should not expect it. When the American na- tion moved from biblical covenantalism to halfway covenantalism, it remained open to a universal god, though Newtonian-Unitarian. Article VI, Clause 3 of the Constitution closed the door judicially to any transcendent god beyond the political order itself. The Constitu- tion is therefore an apostate covenant; a wholly new god is ordained in it, a god acknowledged by the Framers in order to ordain it and 11.

Rush still hoped for a revolution in the hearts of the people, still dreamed the war would introduce ‘among us the same temperance in pleasure, the same modesty in dress, the same justice in business, and the same veneration for the name of the Deity which distinguished our ancestors .’ But bv the summer of 1777 hoDes were tarnished with doubts. and he saw . , ‘a gloomY cloud hinging over our states.’ He once feared Tories would subvert the cause; now he saw the corrosiveness of internal danger. ‘If we are undone at all,’ he said in early August, ‘it must be by the aristocratic, the mercenary, the persecuting, and the arbitrary spirit of our own people – I mean the people who are called Whigs.’” Hawke, Benjamin Rurh: RevolutionaV GadJy (Indianapolis, Indiana: Bobbs- Merrill, 1971), p. 203. 12, Carl L.

This national god can neither offer nor defend any uni- versal rights of man. It can only offer power to the national State, with derivative power in the states. The national State becomes the sole definer and guarantor of American rights, which today means five people on the U.S. Supreme Court. Farewell to Christendom Washington’s Farewell Address of 1796 (a newspaper article, not an actual verbal address) reflected a major change in the thinking of Americans. A new nationalism had already appeared. Washington’s address merely ratified this shift in popular thinking. There must be no covenants with other nations, Washington said. He did not use the words, “no entangling alliances,” but this is what he meant. He thereby announced the end of the older Puritan vision of Trinitarian universalism, the kingdom of God on earth. There can be no cove- nanted community of nations in a world marked by nation-states created by exclusively national democratic gods. The new demo- cratic nationalism destroyed the covenantal foundation of Chris- tendom when it removed the covenantal foundation of Trinitarian national covenants. There is no neutrality. There are two kingdoms in history. Both kingdoms seek to establish covenantal connections. Satan’s kingdom is an empire: a top-down, centralized, bureaucratic system. In- itiative is at the top. God’s kingdom is a bottom-up, decentralized, appeals court system. Initiative is at the bottom. In God’s kingdom, Christian localism is supposed to lead also to Christian regionalism, to Christian nationalism, and finally to Christian internationalism, just as it was supposed to do in Old Covenant Israel. 14 Israel failed in internationalizing God’s kingdom, so God gave the kingdom to a new nation, the Church International (Matt. 21:42-43). Christian civil governments are supposed to imitate the churches, and the churches are not to remain the tiny, fragmented, isolated institutions that Madisonian political nominalism and extreme denominational confessionalism have made them. Like the Trinity who created it, the international Church of Jesus Christ is to be both one— a unity based on Athanasian confessionalism – and many: traditional de- nominational practices and confessions.

It was this that the American colonies should have revolted against in 1776; instead, they allowed the merchants, the lawyers, the Unitarians, and the Freemasons to set the agenda for covenant- breaking revolution. The result is today’s apostate national cove- nantalism and denominational impotence, just as Madison planned. In contrast to God’s kingdom, Satan’s empire leads to the reduc- tion of localism through the investiture of total political power at the top: the central international state facing the lone, atomized individ- ual. This is Rousseau’s nationalism writ large: the political elimina- tion of all intermediary institutions. It is also Madison’s and Hamil- ton’s: the political trivialization of all intermediary institutions. This new nationalism also created the need for a new humanist interna- tional pantheon, i.e., the revival of Imperial Rome: an international one-world order which must be a one-State order, a world in which the national gods remain forever silent except as relics of the new world order. , What I am arguing is that nationalism is an intermedia~ histo;cal step in the progress of the two kingdoms. It is not the final resting place of either Christian covenantalism or humanistic covenantalism. We are inevitably headed toward world government, both civil and ecclesi- astical. World government is an inescapable concept, given the uni- versalistic claims of both God and Satan. Neither God nor Satan is about to “back oH” in his claims for total allegiance. The question therefore is: By whose covenant will this world government be created? I offer this litmus test or early warning system regarding the coming of humanism’s one-world order: Christian missions. The day the churches stop sending out missionaries is the day we can mark the next step of the extension of Satan’s one-world kingdom. The missionary is living proof of the continuing commitment of Chris- tians to world government. He is the representative of Christian inter- nationalism. The missionary delivers a universal message: the king- dom of God. He delivers God’s announcement of His sovereignty. The missionary delivers Go#s covenant i?awsuit to foreign nations. He also brings a denominational slant to the message. Unfortunately, Christian social thought has ignored the missionary for so long– as if the work of world missions were some sort of peripheral Church activity — that Christians have for two centuries or more been en- chanted by spurious nationalism and spurious denominationalism."},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"Conclusion, Part 3 531 In fact, these two spurious views feed on one another. They keep Christians thinking small. They work together to limit the bound- aries of Christianity’s vision of victory. Meanwhile, Satan has nearly completed the creation of his one- world political order. Without the special grace of God in the form of a major international revival of Trinitarian faith, only the common grace of God through the intense rivalries of fallen men will be able to call a halt to this demonic political process. One thing is sure: it will not be stopped by “Christian nationalism.” There are no longer any Christian nations, covenantally speaking. Roger Williams and his spiritual heirs did their work very well. From 1776 to 1787 Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence compromised the origi- nal Christian covenantalism of the states by joining them together in an alliance of independent states under the authority of nature and nature’s god, a myth of Unitarian theology. The Articles of Con- federation completed the Declaration’s halfway covenant by creating the United States of America: a true covenant document rather than a mere alliance of judicially independent states. The Constitution then eliminated all references to the Newtonian god and his sup- posed grant of rights to men. It created a new national god, one that is an affront to humanist internationalism, but also an affront to Christian internationalism. Nationalism is a dying philosophy today. It will not be sustained institutionally forever. The question is: What will replace it? Political fragmentation, a new humanist world order, or a new Christian world order? So powerful is the Constitution in the eyes of American Chris- tians that they have rejected Christian internationalism as if it were a satanic philosophy. They have lost the Puritan vision. That was precisely Madison’s agenda in 1787. By trivializing the churches and by exalting the new national government, he dealt a blow against Puritanism. Puritanism has yet to recover.

Her “red books” serve as textbooks for many Christian day schools and home schools. Miss Hall has articulated the dilemma we Christians face as Christians: the nature of self-government. The first lesson the American Christian must learn if he would success- fully develop, maintain or restore the Christian republic, is Christian self- government. Self-government without the modifier “Christian” in its full Biblical meaning, is nothing more than self-will regardless of initial intent to be or do good. Man without Christ cannot succeed in producing lasting good. 17 Never in the history of the world has there been such an example of Christian voluntary union in civil affairs as was exhibited by the colonists between 1775 and 1783. This costly experience laid the groundwork for the adoption of our National Federal Constitution six years later in 1789.18 In these two statements, separated by three and a half paragraphs, we see the reasons why Miss Hall’s task is inherently impossible to complete honestly: to write a Christian Constitutional history of the United States. Each of Miss Hall’s three volumes ends no later than 1777. There is surely a reason for this, other than lack of time or money; the first volume appeared in 1960; the last, Consider and Ponder, appeared in 1975.

These narratives were frequently written by Uni- tarians and non-Trinitarians, for non-Christians controlled Ameri- can publishing after the Civil War. John Fiske, 20 for example, was one of the great champions of evolutionism. Historiography is not a neutral enterprise. It is shaped by the presuppositions of the authors. There was no market for explicitly Christian histories in 1890; there is very little demand even today, and even then what we get is Noll- Hatch-Marsden. There are a lot of conservative Christians who have seen the set’s title, but who have not read the contents. They take it for granted that the set’s primary source documents really do prove that the Constitution was originally Christian. This is a grave mistake. There are no primary source documents in these books that extend beyond the outbreak of the Revolutionary War. What the post-1776 documents do show is that after the War ended, Christian influences in the country declined for a decade or more. This is the argument of Nell, Hatch, and Marsden, and it is corroborated by most of the primary sources that I am familiar with. The pastors certainly com- plained about this moral decline in their published sermons and pri- vate correspondence and diaries. Perhaps the presently unpublished volumes compiled by Miss Hall and Miss Slater will at last present the missing evidence, although I doubt it. If so, then the book’s narrative needs to show why it was that from 1776 on, those who organized the Convention were so determined to remove or overcome the binding authority of pre-Revolutionary Trinitarian state oaths. That, of course, will not be possible if the books continue to rely on nineteenth-century hu- manist textbooks to supply the narratives. The Unasked Questions Miss Hall says that she began her intellectual journey when she was employed by a federal bureaucracy which she recognized was socialistic in intent. 21 She wondered how this had come about, given the existence of the Constitution.

The Constitution’s Framers unquestionably began their historic efforts with the presupposition of the indispensability of moral self- government. Nevertheless, the document they produced catego- rical y and formally rejects the concept of Christian self-government. And, citing Miss Hall again, “Self-government without the modifier ‘Christian’ in its full Biblical meaning, is nothing more than self-will regardless of initial intent to be or do good. Man without Christ can- not succeed in producing lasting good.” The good that the Constitu- tion was intended to do could not survive unscathed. The hard question that is never faced clearly and decisively by those who defend the theory of the Christian origins of the Constitu- tion is this one: Why were the Articles of Confederation inherently less Christian than the Constitution, and so ineffective that a con- spiracy had to be entered into, organized initially in 1785-87 by Freemasons, Deists, and proto-Unitarians, in order to restore inherently Christian principles of national government? To put it another way, why were the lawyers in charge of the Con- vention and the pastors absent? Why were the pamphlet debates of 1787-88 conducted in terms of Roman historical examples and not biblical historical examples? Why was there never any appeal to spe- cific biblical laws, but endless appeals to natural laws? Why were the symbols adopted by the Continental Congress, the Convention, and the post-War nation systematically non-Christian? Why, if the Con- stitution is Christian, is the name of Jesus Christ missing? There is only one sensible answer: the U.S. Constitution is not Christian. Surprises We should not be surprised to learn that Joseph Smith, founder of Mormonism, taught that the Constitutional Convention was either divinely inspired or very close to it. ‘And for this purpose,” he has God say, “have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood .“ 22 Smith prayed: “Have mercy, O Lord, upon all the nations of the earth; have mercy upon 22.

These facts are freely admitted by E. Cecil McGavin in his book, Mormonism and Ma.sony (1956), which is often sold in Mormon book- stores. 24 Smith’s last words, “O Lord my God,” is a Masonic cry, and he uttered it because he hoped that the Masons in the crowd that killed him would intervene on his behalf. Instead, they joined in the execution. 25 (The spirit of fraternity has its limits, apparently.) What is surprising is that so many conservative Christians today are seeking the previously hidden Christian roots of the U.S. Consti- tution. These are not hidden roots; they are missing roots. The roots of the Constitution are Rhode Island political theory, Newtonian philosophy, Deist-Unitarian-Whig social theory, Scottish Enlighten- ment rationalism, and Masonic universalist. The Constitution’s structure was Christian-Puritan; its content was humanist. There may well be trappings that are Christian, for the Framers were men of their era, and that era was at bottom Christian. But the Christian- ity of eighteenth-century America was deeply schizophrenic. Newton was the favored model, not Paul on Mars Hill (Acts 17). The primary problem with Protestant Christianity in the eigh- teenth century was its ethical and judicial dualism: biblical law vs. natural law. The problem has been dualism for eighteen hundred years. The two systems are rival systems, yet Christians persist in arguing that they are at bottom the same, even when they simultan- eously insist that there is no neutrality. They affirm, yet subse- quently deny, that “The first lesson the American Christian must learn if he would successfully develop, maintain or restore the Chris- tian republic, is Christian self-government.

I have argued that the Framers were generally committed to a specific historical model: republican Rome. They used Roman pseudonyms in their pamphlet wars. (So did their Antifederalist ad- versaries. ) They adopted Roman architecture for the nation’s capitol. But there was a problem that they all recognized and feared, for good reason: republican Rome became imperial Rome. Cicero was no doubt eloquent; he also died a fugitive from justice, slain by agents of the authorities. 26 If vox populi is in fact vox dei, why did Cicero die a fugitive of the people’s justice? The pantheon of Rome was polytheistic in appearance, but it was monotheistic in substance. The many gods of the expanding Republic were united by their place in Rome’s religious order. They publicly manifested the unifying power of the Roman State. By the time of Christ, the Republic had become the Empire. The Roman pantheon was then international in scope. Every god of every cap- tive people had a lawful place in the pantheon, testifying publicly to the subordination of each god’s city to the Empire. One God was conspicuously absent from this pantheon: the God of the Bible. This God acknowledged no other god and no other kingdom but His own. Rome was under the authority of this God, not over it. And so, there was from the beginning an inevitable civil war between Christ and Caesar, Church and State. This war was eventually won by the earthly representatives of the ascended Christ. ~ Christians finally replaced pagans in the offices of civil authority. This “Constantinian settlement” still outrages and embarrasses political polytheists in the modern Church: fundamentalists, pietists, neo-evangelical liberals, and Christian college professors everywhere. 28 They much prefer to see pagans occupy the seats of civil authority, so the example of Constantine offends them.

Like the Hebrew slaves in Egypt, they prefer rule by polytheistic taskmasters in the service of a divine State to self-rule under God’s revealed law, administered in terms of biblical cove- nants. The end results of this perverse preference are grim: added years of bondage in Egypt, followed by aimless wandering in the wil- derness, or else the fate of Korah and Dathan (Num. 16). It is time to begin making plans for the conquest of Canaan. Biblical Law or Natural Law In a perceptive essay on the relationship between the biblical covenant and modern Constitutional law, E. M. Gaffney presents a subsection: ‘American Constitutional Law as a Corrective to Religion.” He announces that “The main burden of this essay has been to show that secular law influenced the formation and develop- ment of major themes of biblical religion. It is now my point that American constitutional law can continue to serve this function by correcting adherents to biblical religion when they fail either to ac- cept the demands of biblical religion concerning justice and free- dom, or when they fail to acknowledge that in some major respects biblical religion did not adequately resolve issues of justice and free- dom.”n He then appeals to the Torah as a document promoting a pluralism of legal traditions. This is proved, he says, by the con- flicting interpretations of the Bible. 30 He forthrightly contrasts the Bible and justice. This is standard humanist fare, especially humanism within the churches. Biblical law is seen as offering society a potential threat of tyranny, a means of unleashing oppressive forces in society. The presumption here is that humanistic law is the proper corrective for biblical oppression. Chris- tianity is therefore desperately in need of humanism in order to main- tain freedom. So runs the standard halfway covenant party line. 29.

We have not seen biblical law in action in Christian soci- eties. Instead, century after century, Church scholars have imported the prevailing brands of humanist philosophy, social theory, and jurisprudence into the churches, all in the name of justice. And when one society did its best to avoid this error — New England Puri- tanism — Roger Williams appeared on the scene and started the first covenantally “open” society to serve as the model. Winthrop or Williams In the first case, we have John Winthrop and the first generation of Puritans, whose company Williams had fled. Yale historian Edmund Morgan describes them: Nevertheless, the Puritans did make strong demands on human nature, for they were engaged in a mission that requ;ed great exertion. They had undertaken to establish a society where the will of God would be observed in every detail, a kingdom of God on earth. While still aboard the Arbella, Winthrop had explained to his fellow immigrants their solemn commitment to this task. Every nation, they all knew, existed by virtue of a covenant with God in which it promised to obey His commands. They had left Eng- land because England was failing in its promise. In high hope that God was guiding them and would find their efforts acceptable, they had proposed to form a new society. Now God had demonstrated His approval. He had made way for them by a “special overruling providence .“ By staying His wrath so long and allowing them to depart in peace, by delivering them safe across the water, He had sealed a covenant with them and given them a spe- cial responsibility to carry out the good intentions that had brought them into the wilderness. Theirs was a special commission. And “when God gives a special commission,” Winthrop warned them, “He lookes to have it stricktly observed in every Article.”31 Willard Sperry, Dean of the Harvard Divinity School, has painted an accurate picture of Williams, who took for his social model natural law rather than covenant theology. He lived only some forty miles from Boston; but between Providence and Boston a great gulf was fixed, theologically and ecclesiastically. Williams 31. Edmund S.

The right of magistrates is natural, human, civil, not religious. The officer of the state gains nothing and loses nothing by being a Christian, or by not being. Likewise, the Christian mer- chant, physician, lawyer, pilot, father, master are not better equipped for fulfdling their social function than are the members of any other religion. There can be no such thing as a Christian business, or a Christian profes- sion of law or medicine. These vocations stand in their own right. No state may claim superiority over any other state by virtue of being, or professing to be, Christian. The state is not irreligious; it is simply non-religious. As for the church, Williams said it was like a college of physicians, a company of East India merchants, or any other society in London, which may con- vene themselves and dissolve themselves at pleasure. Roger W illiams’s ideas in these matters were and still are overstatements and oversimplifica- tions of the problem. Indeed, he followed the logic of his own thinking so far that he outgrew the visible organized church, even of his own independ- ent kind, and finally parted with all institutional religion. Yet his overstate- ments were so true to Baptist convictions that one can readily see how this strongest single sect in the colonies, advocating religious liberty for all, was in entire good conscience prohibited by its own faith from any slightest in- terest in a union of church and state. 32 But this does not answer the more fundamental covenantal prob- lem: What about the union of religion and State? No State can live without a religion. There is no neutrality. The question is: Which reli- gion? There is no question which religion the Baptists chose for their State: Jeffersonian Unitarianism. This remains the continuing polit- ical manifestation of the failure of the American Baptist Culture. 33 The choice for Christians in America has been this one since 1636: John Winthrop or Roger Williams, God’s law or man’s law, civil covenant-keeping or civil covenant-breaking. For over three centuries, Americans have made the wrong choice. So has virtually everybody else on earth.

This myth was the foundation of eighteenth-century Enlightenment humanism, both right wing and left wing. The virtuous humanist leader, whether Washington or Robespierre, is not a defender of explicitly Christian virtues. The theoretical foundations of this myth collapsed with the coming of Darwinism, but the myth’s rhetoric still persists whenever the covenantal remains of that lost world are proclaimed as the law of the land, i.e., whenever Christians are told that the idea of bibli- cal theocracy is morally perverse and the idea of political pluralism is God’s preferred plan for the New Covenant era. To build a good society there must first be an accurate vision of the good society: a fixed vision unaltered by the flux of history. There must also be a permanent concept of personal morality that remains constant despite changing circumstances. These two visions must reinforce each other: the good society and the righteous indi- vidual. This combination is what was lacking in Greek political phi- losophy. The righteous philosopher, who was to be a master of doubt, was seen both by the Socratic philosophers and by the civil authorities as a threat to the stability and peace of conventional soci- ety, which is one reason — though in my view not the only reason — why the philosopher-king was supposed to resort to misleading rhet- oric and “noble lies .“W There must also be an institutional arrangement to bridge the gap between the mutually reinforcing social and individual ideals within the flux of history. Humanism offers no consistent, widely agreed-upon solution to these problems. This is why the voluntary civil contract between men or among men is no valid substitute for the civil covenant between or among men under the sovereign Creator God of the Bible. We must never forget that there is no such thing as a civil compact; all such hypo- thetical compacts are in fact covenants under God, whether the par- ticipants believe this or not. (The same is true of marriage “contracts.”) Such a contractual view of society,, denies that God has created soci- ety, established hierarchies, declared His permanent law, and en- forces this law in history through positive and negative sanctions, 34.

The State, as the judge and enforcer, becomes the agent that de- clares the will of the People. Modern civil justice is viewed by liberals as the product of pro- cedurally precise confrontations between trained specialists in the law – the rule of the lawyers. The almost pathological and poten- tially bankrupting quest for procedural perfection in the modern American court system is a consistent development of this seven- teenth- and eighteenth-century liberal philosophy. 35 But there is no way for the humanist to prove that procedural precision during the lawyers’ confrontation can in fact produce justice, except by dejining justice as “the product of a procedurally precise outcome.” There is no higher law to appeal to, and no sanctioning agency other than the State, except during a revolution. The Expansion of the Autonomous State When men abandon biblical covenantalism, they must find a substitute. There is no escape from covenantalism; the question always is: W%ose covenant? Modern liberalism became steadily sta- tist, except for a brief interlude during the nineteenth century (pre-1890),36 because the State, as the sovereign enforcer of the Peo- ple’s covenant, has attained the position of divine-right status: there is no appeal beyond it. It alone supposedly speaks authoritatively for the sovereign People. Revolution alone can legitimately overturn the State, but this must always be in the name of the true sovereign, the People. This worldview is the legacy of John Locke. The political compact among autonomous men has replaced the biblical covenant as the agreed-upon source of social continuity. Therefore, the primary goal of politics today (and just about every- thing else) is to gain control over the monopolistic voice of authority, the State.

If there are no ethical standards inside the contractual shells, then we should expect to see a lot of broken shells as time goes by, as people continue their search for righteous civil government. There is no sovereign God in contractualism who will judge the righteousness of men’s contracts, in time or eternity. Man is officially on his own. Thus, there is only procedure. In cases of civil dispute, the only question is: Which of the parties best honored the formal terms of the contract, meaning the letter of the contract? This means the trt”umph ofjine print and the lawyers who alone can interpret it. To the extent that questions of ethics enter into the judge’s decision — substantive questions – the result is judicial arbitrariness. Such judi- cial arbitrariness erodes the very foundation and justification of con- tractualism: procedural predictabili~. This creates an intellectual at- mosphere favorable to revolution. Every would-be spokesman for the People wants to be sure that his version of god’s word is enforced. The inherent, inevitable dualism or dialecticism between formal procedure and ethics, 37 between the letter of humanist law and the 37.

And this means there is no humanist answer to the question: What procedural arrangement can be devised to increase the likeli- hood that righteous decisions will be made by those in authority? The Framers attempted to devise such a system, but their en- deavor was doomed from the beginning, for they denied the legitimacy of the biblical covenant. They broke the halfway national covenant, and we appear to be living in the era of God’s cumulative negative sanctions in response to this act of covenantal rebellion. The Forgotten Meeting Before we end this discussion of the Constitution, we need to take note of a forgotten event. On Friday, May 25, 1787, the first meeting of the Constitutional Convention began in Philadelphia. George Washington was elected president of the Convention. A secretary was elected, Major Jackson. The meeting then adjourned. The Convention began its first full session on Monday, May 28. Across town, another meeting was ending that fateful Monday. The united Presbyterian Synods of New York and Philadelphia had met together. What they did at that final session, and at the meeting exactly one year later, was to change the course of Protestantism in America. It also paralleled to a remarkable degree the political events being engineered by James Madison. The issues were also similar: the relation of Church and State, and the issue of central- ized authority. 7%e Problem of Geography Like Madison and his associates, between 1785 and 1789, a quiet group of churchmen in the Presbyterian Church had been preparing for a major reorganization. Even today, it is not entirely clear from the historical records just who was behind this push. There was no sense of imminent ecclesiastical crisis, but there was a sense of failure in the face of continuing problems that never seemed to get resolved. War weariness had tiected all the denominations, Presbyterians in- cluded. What had begun as a sacred cause of liberty had produced un- foreseen negative results, as war always does. The loose morals that the war had unleashed made the church’s work that much more difficult. 38 38.

Increased immigration from Scotland, was making the church more theologi- cally conservative, less enthusiastic about the heritage of the Great Awakening. 39 At the same time, these immigrants were heading West, where there were no well-organized presbyteries. w There was also a growing reaction against Deism, skepticism, and the increas- ingly liberal rationalism of the remnants of Jonathan Edwards’ ra- tionalistic theology, the New Side heritage. Attendance at the annual synod meetings had declined during the war and had not recovered. The expanding geography of the American nation by 1780 had overthrown the theory of a single an- nual synod meeting that could handle all business not capable of being handled at the presbytery level.41 Changes were needed. A committee was appointed in 1785 to draw up a new form of Presby- terian discipline. Then, later in the day, another overture was sug- gested: the creation of a General Assembly, along the lines of the Scottish church, and the creation of three synods. The records do not indicate who made this overture. AZ On the face of it, this overture was highly peculiar. If the institu- tional problem facing the denomination was geographical, why would anyone propose the creation of a General Assembly? The an- swer should have been obvious: to centralize thz denomination once andfor all. If the regional presbyteries were becoming more distant from the center, then there would have to be a central representative body as well as central~”udicial body that could hold the Church’s governmental sys- tem together. (This was exactly what Madison had concluded re- garding American civil government.) The Committee on Overture took over; a second study on Church government began. As is usual for Presbyterianism, no official decision was made at that time. (This was paralleled by the late-March meeting at Mount Vernon at which Maryland and Virginia commissioners proposed ways of settl- ing trade disputes. And like the Synod meeting, the records of what took place are unclear.)qs 39. Ibid., pp. 263-64. 40. Ibid., pp. 268-72. 41. Ibid., pp. 281-82. 42. Ibid., p. 283. 43. Writes Burton K.

Action on the creation of four synods was postponed.~ The report of the committee on discipline was discussed, but no action was taken. A new committee was set up to continue the study. A meeting in September of 1786 led to a draft of a whole new constitu- tion, to which the presbyteries generally paid little attention. 45 (These events were paralleled by Madison’s and Hamilton’s in- conclusive Annapolis convention in September, which in turn led to the call for the Convention in Philadelphia.) Then came the Synod of 1787. From May 16 to May 28, the Synod met in Philadelphia to discuss the formation of a new church structure. On the last day of the Synod, May 28, the Synod voted to create yet another committee to print a thousand copies of the draft of the proposed form of government to be sent to the presbyteries for consideration. The presbyteries would have to confirm the plan. (This was paralleled by the Constitutional Convention’s decision to have state ‘ratifying conventions vote on the proposed new plan of government. One difference: the presbyteries were the legal equiva- lent of the established state legislatures, rather than conventions.) The changes recommended by the committee were approved by the joint Synod meeting exactly one year later in Philadelphia: May 28, 1788. This judicial act established a new constitution, 46 pages long, for the Presbyterian Church in America. The form of govern- ment radically centralized power in the General Assembly. From that time on, it would take a two-thirds vote of the presbyteries plus the assent of the General Assembly to make further changes, The Synod did this on its own authority; after consultation with ~he pres- byteries; the presbyteries did not vote.4G (On June 21, New Hamp- shire became the ninth state convention to ratify the Constitution; the new nation came into being.) Trinterud tries to make this-sound as if it was not a monumental centralization of power. After all, he says, the General Assembly could not initiate any further changes; only the presbyteries could. 47 This is hardly persuasive. Try to organize presbyteries that are scat- tered across a growing country. Get them to initiate and then organ- ize fundamental change. The whole discussion of the change in 44.

The new plan also entitled the General Assembly to issue stand- ing rules, which a majority of the presbyteries would have to ratify. Any student of bureaucracy can see what the results would be. The General Assembly would normally be attended by the activists in the presbyteries. Thus, any organized resistance by over half of the pres- byteries would be unlikely. To change this new system, it would take a two-thirds vote of the presbyteries. Church and ,State The restructured form of government included a revision of the Westminster Confession of Faith: specifically, Chapter XX (closing paragraph), XXH1:3, and XXXI:l, 2. These were the sections deal- ing with the relationship of Church and State, in which the civil mag- istrate was charged with certain tasks, such as defending the Church and calling assemblies. The main figure on the committee was New Side leader John Rogers, who had served on all of them since 1785. He became an ecclesiastical leader in the late 1760s during the colonial battle against the sending of an Anglican bishop to the colonies. 4s He believed so greatly in the separation of Church and State that he thought ministers should not vote in civil elections.49 The Synod was adjourned. In 1788, it reconvened, and the recommended changes in the Confession were approved. Church historian Philip Schaff de- scribes these alterations: The changes consist in the omission of those sentences which imply the union of Church and State, or the principle of ecclesiastical establishments, making it the duty of the civil magistrate not only to protect, but also to support religion, and giving to the magistrate power to call and ratify eccle- siastical synods and councils, and to punish heretics. Instead of this, the American revision confines the duty of the -civil magistrate to the legal pro- tection of religion in its public exercise, without distinction of Christian creeds or organizations. It thus professes the principle of religious liberty and equality of all denominations before the law. This principle has been faithfully and consistently adhered to by the large body of the Presbyterian Church in America, and has become the common law of the land.50 48.

This seemed appropri- ate, for it was Witherspoon who almost certainly had written the Preface to the proposed new form of government back in 1786. The Preface stated: “God alone is Lord of the conscience; and bath left it free from the doctrine and commandments of men, which are in any thing contrary to his word, or beside it in matters of faith or worship;” Therefore they [Presbyterians] consider the rights of private judgment, in all matters that respect religion, as universal and inalienable: they do not even wish to see any religious con- stitution aided by the civil power, further than may be necessary for protec- tion and security, and, at the same time, be equal and common to others. 51 The End of the Ho~ Commonwealth Ideal Thus ended the ideal of the theocratic republic in mainstream Presbyterianism and American Protestantism in general. That this official position had been articulated by the president of the College of New Jersey was fitting. Its predecessor, the Log College, had been the leading light in the battle against what Trinterud calls “the narrow spirit of denominationalism .” 52 Founded in 1746, its trustees had in- vited newly appointed Governor Jonathan Belcher onto the Board of Trustees in 1748. They immediately voted him president of the Board. Governor Belcher saw to it that the college was granted a new charter, and he worked hard to create a new board filled (with three excep- tions) with graduates of Harvard and Yale. This is understandable; he had been Governor of Massachusetts from 1730-41. The college was moved to Newark; in 1755, it was moved to Princeton. 53 That Jonathan Belcher became the driving force of the develop- ment of the College of New Jersey is representative of what was tak- ing place throughout the colonies. Belcher was not a Presbyterian. Nevertheless, he found it easy to cooperate with Presbyterians. His theology was expressly geared to cooperation. Jonathan Belcher was 51. Cited in James H.

But this puts it too mildly. Jonathan Belcher was the original Freemason in the colonies, having been initiated in London in 1704.5A He was literally the pioneer. One Masonic historian refers to him as “the Senior Freemason of America.”55 After his initiation, he experienced rapid success as a merchant. 56 His son became the Deputy Grand Master of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Massachu- setts at its founding in 1733.57 In 1741, the brethren of the First Lodge read a message to Mr. Belcher, who had been succeeded by a new governor the previous spring. The lodge thanked him for “the many favours You have always shared (when in Power) to Masonry in General. . . . “5 8 The spirit of nondenominationalism at the College of New Jersey was not going to be overturned by Brother Belcher! It should be no surprise to learn what President Witherspoon re- vealed in 1776, in his quest for nondenominational money from donors in Bermuda, namely, that no discussion of church government was tolerated at the college. “Every question about forms of church government is so entirely excluded that . . . if they [the students] know nothing more of religious controversy than what they learned here, they have that Science wholly to begin.”5g Thus, concludes Tiinterud, James Madison did not learn about Presbyterian polity from Withers- peon. “The theological doctrine of natural law and the political theory of natural rights provided the meeting place for Presbyterian and citi- zen rather than the Presbyterian form of Church government. New England Congregationalists and Virginia Episcopalians stood with American Presbyterian laymen in this political theory, and with this common heritage they were able to work together although their heritages in ecclesiastical polity still separated them widely.” fro Brother Belcher would have been proud.

Thus, the Whigs political and the Whigs ecclesiastical had at last overturned the covenantal foundations that had been established by their seventeenth-century Puritan enemies, and had done so in a period of slightly less than thirteen months. Governor William Livingston of New Jersey was correct when he observed in 1790 that the clergy of America were “almost all uni- versally good Whigs.”61 He himself had been “the American Whig” in 1768, when he wrote or at least organized a series of New Yin-k Gazette and Pennsylvania Journal articles against sending an Anglican bishop to the colonies, a step regarded by many colonists as being the first step in Parliamentary control over colonial religion.’2 Yet it was “the American Whig” himself who had asked rhetorically the most important question in American history: “. . . why might not Christianity have been allowed the honor of being called the Na- tional Re1igion?”G3 The answer should be clear by now: because the Unitarians did not want it that way, and the Whigs ecclesiastical did not really think that the implicit Christianity of the nation was threatened by the idolatry of the new national covenant, i.e., the People as the new national god. A year after the 1788 Synod, in May of 1789, the General Assem- bly had John Witherspoon again chair a committee, this time to pre- pare an address to the newly elected President of the United States. The alternate chairman was John Rogers. The committee drafted a lengthy report in which it expressed those sentiments that have been passed down from textbook to textbook. Echoing Washington’s Masonic rhetoric, the address announced: “Public virtue is the most certain means of public felicity, and religion is the surest basis of vir- tue. We therefore esteem it a peculiar happiness to behold in our Chief Magistrate a steady, uniform, avowed friend of the Christian religion, and who on the most public and solemn occasions devoutly 61.

As the Presbyterians closed their meet- ing and the Framers opened theirs, the nation was turned down a path that would have been covenantally unthinkable anywhere on earth a generation earlier (except, of course, in Rhode Island). In this case, the change in men’s thinking transformed the constitutional (covenantal) foundations of both Church and State in America. What had been called the Presbyterian Rebellion by its enemies in Eng- land became a Presbyterian revolution judicially. The Presbyterians and the Framers ended the holy commonwealth ideal in America. The Presbyterians of Philadelphia, like the lawyers of Philadelphia, removed the covenantal foundations of the American Christian ex- periment in Christian self-government. Without these covenantd cornerstones to support it, the American Trinitarian edifice col- lapsed. We live today in its ruins. Conclusion By 1800, the myth of the national covenant was just about over. The churches, in the words of Perry Miller, “were forced to recog- nize that in fact they now dealt with the Deity only as particular indi- viduals gathered for historical, capricious reasons into this or that communion. They had to realize, at first painfully, that as a united people they had no contractual relationship with the Creator, and that consequently a national controversy with Him could no longer 64.

There would be no more national controversies with God. He would no longer threaten the nation with His negative sanctions. 69 If it were not for the continuing presence of the remnant Church (Chapter 11), Miller would be correct. God would have washed His hands of this nation long ago. He would have imposed His negative sanctions. Despite the historical facts – both theological and Constitutional — that I have surveyed in this study, from the beginning of the Con- stitutional era, Christian historians have promoted the myth of the Christian origin of the Constitution. Philip Schaff, the most promi- nent American evangelical Church historian of the late nineteenth century, summarized this view, and the language of his imitators has not deviated in any significant respect: We may go further and say that the Constitution not only contains nothing which is irreligious or unchristian, but is Christian in substance, though not in form. It is pervaded by the spirit of justice and humanity, which are Christian. . . . The Constitution, moreover, in recognizing and requiring an official oath from the President and all legislative, executive, and judicial officers, both of the United States and of the several States, recognises the Supreme Being, to whom the oath is a solemn appeal. . . . And, finally, the framers of the Constitution were, without exception, be- lievers in God and in future rewards and punishments, from the presiding officer, General Washington, who was a communicant member of the Epis- copal Church, down to the least orthodox, Dr. Benjamin Franklin. . . . TO There are minor variations, of course. Rushdoony argues that the Constitution is neutral both in substance and in procedure. (See Appendix B.) But on the whole, Schaffs statement is representative of two centuries of incomparable historical misrepresentation — a myth that is taken seriously by virtually all conservative American Christians. The conspirators were successful beyond their wildest 67. Perry Miller, Nature’s Nation (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1967), p. 113. 68.

Did they really teach such views? 70.

Their victims still do not know what happened to them. That a serious historian could write about the oath in this manner – the oath that is in fact the exact opposite of what Schaff claims it is – is nothing short of mind-boggling. It is self-deception on a scale not normally encountered, even in academia. The oath does indeed rec- ognize the Supreme Being, to whom the oath is a solemn appeal; that Supreme Being is the sovereign incorporating People. And Arti- cle VI, Clause 3 announces, theologically speaking: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” Missing Pieces It is now the time and place to admit that I have neglected a very important institutional question. I have not yet done the necessary research. This much seems clear: if we properly begin our inquiry into the origins of the Constitution with the founding of the Royal Society (1661), the publishing of Newton’s Principia (1687), and the creation of the Grand Lodge (1717), we should not skip over the for- mation of the B’ank of England (1694). We need to ask: W%at is the re- lationship between the Bank of England and subsequent events in England, the Netherlands, France, and the new American nation? The path broken by P. G. M. Dickson needs to be widened beyond Britain and extended beyond 1756.71 Few historians have even taken a stroll down this path. This key question regarding central banking and civil govern- ment leads to a subordinate group of questions regarding colonial history and early American history. Our investigation should begin with Hamilton’s statement in Federalist 30: “Money is with propriety considered as the vital principle of the body politic; as that which sustains its life and motion, and enables it to perform its most essen- tial functions .“7 2 Was he using hyperbole, or was he serious? Did money replace the sovereignty of God in his thinking? If so, he was not alone, and would not be alone were he alive today. This question leads to other questions.

Where did Hamilton get the revolutionary idea that the best way to tie the jealous states together was by means of consolidating state debts into a common national debt? Why was Hamilton’s ma- jor act as Secretary of the Treasury to gain a national charter for the foreign-owned Bank of the United States? If national debt is without legal limits, then what about taxation to sustain the debt? Why did the Framers insist that the states be prohibited from issuing coins – even gold and silver coins — and that only gold and silver coins could be declared legal tender by a state (Art. I, Sect. 8), even though they placed no such restrictions on the national government? If inflation was truly regarded by the Framers as the scourge of the states, why should they have regarded inflation as less of a scourge nationally? And why have professional historians ignored these monetary ques- tions for so long? These are questions for another study, another time. But the rule holds good: when we are trying to find the historical origins of any- thing men do, start with how and where people take the sacraments, and then jind out where thty lend or borrow their monty. The covenantal sanctions of God in history are tied to debt: lending is a blessing and borrowing is a curse.

This is a major assumption. If it is no longer in force, then whatever national covenant document is in place will have to be modified or replaced.) Such an amendment is not enough. It would settle only points one and two of the biblical covenant: the sovereign y of God and the subordination of “the people.” The People must be demoted from the sovereign god that established the covenant as suzerain to become once again the vassal that complies with the true Suzerain’s cove- nant.

The third point of the covenant still would have to be dealt with: What about God’s revealed civil law? Will the whole Bible be established as the final law of the land, the common law of the nation? Point four: What about a national oath required of all citizens and all civil magistrates? Will people who are not under eccle- siastical covenant sanctions be allowed to serve as civil magistrates or agents who sanction civil magistrates? Fifth point: What about a sys- tem of adoption: the “naturalization” (meaning de-naturalization) 1 of future citizens? Will all immigrants be allowed to take the national and ecclesiastical Trinitarian oaths, thereby becoming full citizens? Will the nation have open geographical borders, but closed political borders? In short, while it is certainly important to preach the necessity of re-establishing the abandoned Trinitarian state confessions of the colonial Ame~ican period, this is not enough. We need to renew the original civil covenant, this time on a national basis. God’s covenant is comprehensive. We have already seen what happens to halfway national covenants. We do not need a replay of the last two cen- turies. We need a full covenant, not a halfway covenant. Newton’s god was buried by the Framers in 1787; there is no need to seek to resurrect him. This does not mean that the civil magistrate is required by God to launch a wave of religious persecutions. What it means is that the long-term goal of Christians should be the preaching of the compre- hensive gospel of salvation, including the supernatural healing of all institutions. Christians should also pray for and expect a huge re- vival, so that a vast majority of Americans will convert to saving faith in Jesus Christ. If this future postmillennial revival does not take place, then any attempt to establish a national covenant will fail, long-term. It is not our job as Christians to ram religion down everyone’s throat. We must recognize that if postmillennialism is wrong, then the pursuit of the national covenant really is utopian. Worse; it would require massive coercion or deception. We dare not imitate the deceptive strategy of James Madison and his national covenant-breaking accomplices. We also dare not be premature, as Cromwell was. 1. “But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually dis- cerned” (I Cor. 2:14)."},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"Introduction, Part 4 559 A Covenantal Strategy The first step is to adopt a slogan.

Fourth comes loczd politics. At a minimum, this would involve public protests against abortion. From there we go to state and national politics. Before national political renewal can begin, we must first do what we can to make it clear to the politicians and the national government that a major religious transformation has already taken pla~e. Without the widespread movement of the Holy Spirit, this cannot happen. Thus, the national confession movement is either going to shift forthrightly to postmillennialism or else remain a kind of sectarian game for psy- chological outsiders, a monumental pretence that writing forever- ignored manifesto on the need for a national covenant is anything more than a way to keep Christians’ vision focused on an unattainable utopia. Amillennialism coupled with the goal of national confession is an experiment in psychological masochism and sectarianism. Passing out simple gospel tracts on street corners would be more productive for the kingdom of God; at least someone might get saved. Better to experience the joy of seeing sinners get saved from hell than to condemn oneself and one’s church to a lifetime of eschatologically guaranteed disappointment. If one defines himself in terms of an eschatologically lost cause, he is sure to suffer mentally and spiritually. He will also have identified himself as a self-professed loser in a church of self-professed losers. Outsiders will normally avoid joining such denominations. Where should Christians begin? What is required by God today is for His people to press for comprehensive covenant renewal at every level of civil government? Christians must bring a covenant law- mit against this present social order. We must fight to win. We dare not make a lost cause our eschato- logical goal, ei~her ecclesiastically or personally.

Patrick HenT (1788)1 Christians lost the battle in 1788. The lawyers in Philadelphia won it. Christians accepted the ratification of the Constitution, not just as good losers, but as enthusiastic cooperators. They have yet to identify their problem, as decade by decade, the American republic has grown ever-more consistent with the apostate foundation of the Constitution. Christians find themselves besieged today, and they vainly expect to get rid of their problems by a return to the “original intent” of the Framers. On the contrary, what we have today is the political outcome of that original intent, as Henry warned so long ago. Darwinism, socialism, and several major wars speeded up the process of moral disintegration, but the judicial foundation of this disintegration had been established in 1787-88. The political question facing American Christians today is this: How much longer will the Constitution serve as the protector of our 1.

At some point in time, the Constitution will become too great a threat to one side or the other: to covenant-breakers who resent any residue of Constitutional re- straint or to covenant-keepers who have been pushed to the limits of their endurance by the culmination of the original apostate cove- nant. The Constitution’s provisions were written by self-consciously apostate men and conspiratorial Christian colleagues whose under- standing of the biblical covenant had been eroded by a lifetime of Newtonian philosophy and training in the pagan classics. Neverthe- less, these men were under restraints: philosophical (natural rights doctrines) and political (a Christian electorate). Both of these re- straints have almost completely disappeared in the twentieth cen- tury. Thus, the evils implicit in the ratified national covenant have grown more evil over time. Declining Restraints The first set of restraints on the Framers was philosophical: natu- ral rights philosophy. Officially, the Constitution does not recognize natural rights. It was from the beginning far more in tune with the Darwinian world to come than the world of eighteenth-century Whig moral philosophy. Today, almost no one in a place of intellec- tual influence or political authority defends the older natural rights viewpoint. Take the case of the man who is perhaps the most distin- guished and best-known legal scholar and judge in American conser- vatism, Robert Bork. Because of his conservative judicial views, Bork was refused confirmation to the Supreme Court by the U.S. Senate in 1987. We might expect him to be a defender of natural rights. Not so. He was the author of a 1971 essay denying the natural rights foundation of judicial decisions. He denied that moral consi- derations can properly enter into judicial decisions, except insofar as the political decision of the legislature has colored a law.z Judges, he insisted, must remain morally neutral. The older, pre-Darwin moral framework for American Constitutional law is dead. It was a long time dying, both philosophically and judicially. 3 2. Robert Bork, “Natural Principles and Some First Amendment Problems,” Indiana Law Journal (Fall 1971). In this essay, Bork called on judges to adopt a princi- ple of moral neutrality in making judicial decisions.

The Marxists never did accept the theory. Thus, whether the case law approach of the Harvard Law School is adopted or the case law approach of the Bible, natural law or natural rights philosophy no longer provides either covenantal legitimacy or judicial restraint; the philosophical-moral foundation of the original Constitutional settlement — but not the actual document — has disappeared. It is therefore just a matter of time and escalating crises for the U.S. Con- stitution to go the way of the Articles of Confederation. It can be re- defined into something new by the courts, as has been done for over a century, or else it can be replaced by a series of amendments over many years or overnight by a Constitutional convention. If the final option is selected by those who make long-term political plans, it is not the Christians who are the likely candidates to achieve a victory. Strangers in Their Own Land The second set of restraints on the Framers was political: Chris- tian uoters. They still controlled or heavily influenced state politics. They had lost only the battle in Philadelphia. For a time, they re- mained a threat to the humanists who ran the country, but it was a downhill battle after 1788. Liberal theologian and University of Chicago professor of Church history Martin Marty waxes eloquent regarding Franklin and his Deist peers. “Fortunately for later Amer- icans, the Founding Fathers, following the example of Franklin, put their public religion to good use. While church leaders usually forayed only briefly into the public arena and then scurried back to mind their own shops, men of the Enlightenment worked to form a social fabric that assured freedom to the several churches, yet stressed common concerns of society.”4 Today, however, the ‘common con- cerns of society” — legalized pornography and prostitution, for in- stance – have come into conflict with local church freedom. What Marty and virtually all contemporary historians fail to dis- close is that virtually all of these leaders of the American Enlighten- ment had a working model for this common “social fabric”: the Masonic lodges of America (and in Franklin’s case, of France). Some were actual members, bound by its oaths; others were simply literate men of their time, and Masonry was the religion of the New- 4. Martin E.

Its worldview spread far beyond its closed doors in the back rooms of local taverns. This fact the historians fail to mention. “Public religion,” continues Marty, “looked for institutional em- bodiment. A few enterprising deists thought they should make churches of their movement for enlightenment and public religion, but little came of their efforts .“5 Then he adds this non-illuminating note: ‘Masonic lodges embodied some of the teachings of public religion, but the public who were not their members did not see them doing SO.”G This is literally true, but hardly relevant. Of course the public could not see inside the lodges; that was the whole point of lodge secrecy. Had the Christians who voted for the Constitution in 1788 understood what was being done to them, and why it was being done, the Constitution would not have been ratified. But secrecy prevailed: in the lodges and in Philadelphia. Christians became, to cite the stunning title of Marty’s book, pilgrims in their own land. But are Christians still in their own land? If we are, then this means that there is some sort of continuity between the original civil covenants and today’s wilderness condition. If we are strangers in our own land, then this is because we have lost out to interlopers. This, of course, is exactly what the Bible predicts for those who break covenant with God: “The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high; and thou shalt come down very low” (Deut. 28:43). What was lost can be regained. The means of re-conquest is to press toward a new national covenant, and a better national cove- nant, with God. Continuity Despite Discontinuity I have stressed the covenantal discontinuity between the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution. I have argued that the Con- stitution was the product of a COUP. This coup was ratified by the vot- ers and thereby given legitimacy retroactively. The covenantal ques- tion is: Is the United States now a Christian nation? How can it be, if the Constitution is, as I have argued, judicially anti-Christian? Is the United States a Christian nation? The answer lies in the biblical idea of a covenant. Once formally under the terms of God’s personal covenant, there is no escape for the individual. The sanc- tions will eventually be applied, both positive and negative. The 5. Ibid., pp. 164-65. 6.

Some nations have departed completely from the Christian faith in the past, most notably northern Africa, which fell militarily to the Moslems in the seventh and eighth centuries. Christians were defeated in history, and their Muslim descendants have suffered from poverty and back- wardness ever since. There is no trace of that original Christianity. But what about Europe? World War I, the Nazis, World War II, and the fall of Eastern Europe to the Communists indicate the presence of negative historical sanctions, not an escape from God’s covenant. The State Covenants’ Stipulations Remain in Force When Jeroboam pulled the ten tribes out of the kingdom of Israel, he did not escape the terms of Israel’s covenant. He created a halfway covenant political order. He imposed halfway covenant ritualism: Jehovah worship with Baalism’s rituals. He set up the golden calves and hired the lowest elements of the society to become priests (I Ki. 12:28, 31). Nevertheless, Northern Israel did not escape the negative sanctions of the national covenant. The nation drifted into apostasy. Ahab later imposed pure Baalism. But even under Ahab, there remained 7,000 in Israel in Elijah’s day who had not bowed the knee to Baal (I Ki. 19:18). The presence of this remnant church provided the historical continui~ with the original covenant. Their presence allowed God to impose his sanctions. The result was the captivity under Assyria. Jeroboam and Ahab had not escaped the covenant. They only brought the historic sanctions of God on Israel. The continuing presence of the Church in the United States pro- vides the covenantal continuity with the true founders of this nation, those bands of Calvinistic Christians who fled from Europe in the seventeenth century and came here to build a city on a hill. The Founding Fathers were the nearly forgotten men like William Brad- ford of Plymouth Colony and John Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. 7 Like Jeroboam before them, and also like Roger Williams, Pro- fessors Nell, Hatch, and Marsden look to the outward symbols of American civil religion and the details of the nation’s civil “contracts .“ They believe that there never really had been a national covenant — Ahab’s covenantal perspective — and that in any case, the Constitution’s pluralism is today the true religion of this society. 7.

There is covenantal continuity in the United States as surely as there was in the Northern Kingdom in Elijah’s day. It is the continuing presence of people who a~rm the gospel that provides covenantal continuity with the past, as well as with the>ture. It is this cove- nantal continuity that will bring forth (and has brought forth) God’s historic sanctions – sanctions leading either to national oblivion, as they did in North Africa in the seventh century, or to covenantal res- toration. Let us pray that it will be the latter. Jeroboam~ Priesthood The U.S. Constitution is one step beyond Jeroboam’s golden calves, but not yet the covenant of Ahab and Jezebel. Today’s politi- cal leaders are the judicial equivalent of Jeroboam’s priesthood. They are morally superior to Ahab’s 450 priests of Baal and 450 priests of the groves (Asherah). Christians therefore should defend the golden calf of the Constitution as a temporary device that gives us freedom to work for an eventual return to Jerusalem. We now face the threat of a transition to the Ahab and Jezebel school of civil religion, if the plans for a new Constitutional Conven- tion go through. One thing is clear, however: Jeroboam’s halfway covenant world did not survive. Neither did the Articles of Con- federation. Jeroboam’s halfway covenant moved forward into Ahab’s Baalism. We also live under a transitional covenantal settlement. Either this nation will return to its pre-Constitution orthodoxy or else it heads into outright paganism. Judicially speaking, the latter is more likely than the former. We are already judicially pagan. Covenant Sanctions: Church and Family The Anglo-Saxon Masons of the eighteenth century ridiculed atheism, but the atheists have triumphed, just as a handful of Anti- federalists predicted in state ratifying conventions and pamphlets. The Masons used the widely accepted doctrine of neutral natural law to undergird their appeal to religious toleration. They took their Unitarian Masonic oaths in secret, and they took their secular politi- cal oaths, and they thought that all was well. It wasn’t. The worst elements have inherited the supposedly neutral kingdom. The American Civil Liberties Union has few supporters within the lodges of the deeply Masonic South.

But such is the inevitable result of halfway civil covenants. The opponents of the Constitution saw it coming in earl y 1788, but could not get the votes to stop it. Mercy Warren’s Antifederalist lament a decade and a half after ratification has proven prophetic: “. . . most of the inhabitants of America were too proud for monarchy, yet too poor for nobility, and it is to be feared, too selfish and avaricious for a virtuous republic .“ s When men see themselves rather than God as the source of their wealth (Deut. 8:17), they have adopted the fundamental principle of humanism. The in- evitable result is the advent of negative sanctions from God in history (Deut. 8:19-20). This is the threat of retaining We the People.” The question is, can we reverse the drift into political Baalism before these sanctions escalate – not arrive: escalate? They have already arrived, as AIDS indicates. Can we return to Jerusalem without being invaded by the Assyrians? Can we avoid the Ahab covenant? If so, how? I know the jimt step: churches must excommunicate anyone who remains a Mason. Every Mason in every Bible-believing church should be asked to choose between the two implacably rival cove- nants he has sworn to uphold. The double-minded Masons must not make the churches double-minded. Churches must publicly break this covenant with evil. At least in our churches, if not yet in our civil courts, we must not retain the services or the tithes of anyone who sacrifices in the groves of Masonry. Bible-believing churches got us into this mess by refusing to cast out Freemasons beginning 250 years ago. They set the pattern. That pattern has now led to the sec- ularization of the republic. Step two is also clear: Christians must pull their children out of the public schools. It is no wonder that Freemasonry is so supportive of the public schools; the public schools are the State-established churches of the modern world. They are based on the same theology that Masonry promotes: common-ground ethics and government. Parents must break with the public schools as surely as churches must excommunicate Freemasons. Until this is done, this society will remain in its present broken covenant status. God’s negative sanctions will escalate. 8.

The long-term national political goal has to be the substitution of a Trinitarian national oath for the present prohibition against religious test oaths. We need to fight nothing (no test oaths) with something (Trinitarian test oaths). So far, Christians have ac- cepted nothing on principle. In the world of political pluralism, noth- ing (no test oaths) is something (judicial atheism). Closing the Constitution’s Open End The Constitution is presently a judicially open-ended document. I am hereby asking: What t~ someday a mq”orz”~ of citizens should vote to close this open end? The Constitution clearly allows amendments, It allows an amendment to revoke one or more past amendments, as the twenty-first amendment proves: it abolished the eighteenth amendment (Prohibition). If voters change their minds about any Constitutional provision of the past, they possess the authority to rewrite it. To cite Justice Burger regarding the authority of the Supreme Court: “But when we decide a constitutional issue, right or wrong, that’s — that’s it until we change it or the people change it. Don’t forget that. The people made it, and the people can change it. The people could abolish the Supreme Court entirely.”g The Court has never accepted as legally valid any argument that would chal- lenge the substantive content of an amendment. 10 The question of the possibility of legally amending the U. S. Con- stitution in order to remove all traces of its political pluralism is a question that none of the pluralist defenders of today’s anti-Christian pluralistic republic cares to discuss in print. I can hardly blame them. Raising this question exposes to the voting public the exist- ence of the Achilles heel of all political pluralism: its first principle — the sovereignty of the voters 11 – allows pluralism to commit suicide. 9.

My point should be clear enough: once the political pluralist opens the judicial door to the political expression of all possible views, religious and ideological, this has to include the views of those who say that no one holding a rival view will be allowed to vote, once those holding this covenantal view legally amend the Constitution. The voters already say this to convicted felons. They are never again allowed to vote. Why not say it also to those who hold religious or ideological views that would threaten the very foundations of Chris- tian civilization?

Beginning in 1964, the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions began to produce plans for a new constitution. Rexford Guy TugWell wrote a pre- liminary constitution for the “Newstates of America” which he pres- ented for consideration to the Center. 12 This proposed constitution citizens of states. As historian Forrest McDonald says, When the framers of the Constitution referred the proposed supreme law to the people of the states, in their capacities as people of states — rather than having it ratified in any of several ways — they were in fact asserting that was where sovereignty lay. The Congress, the state governors, the state legislatures, and the voters in every state, each in their turn, had oppormnity to reject this assertion; when they unanimously confirmed the pro- cedure, they necessarily confirmed the assertion .“ Forrest McDonald, E Pluribus Unum: The Fortnation of the Anwrican Republic, 1776-1790 (Indianapolis, Indiana: Liberty Press, [1965) 1979), p. 311n. 12. The 1964 proposal recommended breaking up the existing states into new political units. It also included a restructuring of the branches of the federal govern- ment into the Electoral Branch, Planning Branch, Presidency, Legislative Branch, Regulatory Branch, and Judicial Branch. Initiating the amendment process would become the work of the Judicial Council, and with the approval of the President and Senate, the proposed amendment would be voted on by the electorate.

There is a growing fear among conservatives that a Constitutional Convention will be called – the first since 1787 – and then captured by the humanist Left. They are quite properly fearful of any such move to amend the Constitution. 17 Some traditional liberals are also skeptical about any major tampering with the Constitution. Is A New Covenant Document? In mid-1986, Chief Justice Burger resigned from the Supreme Court to take over the directorship of the Bicentennial Constitu- tional Commission, whose meetings are closed to the public, despite being funded by the federal government. 19 This was a visibly strange move: from the highest judicial position in the land to the head of an obscure – deliberately obscure – closed-door “educa- tional” organization. A political cartoon by Oliphant in late June, 1986, featured a drawing of Burger seated behind a little gift stand which was located directly in front of the Supreme Court. The sign on the stand said: “Constitutional Bicentennial Souvenirs.” Smaller signs said: “Gifts!” “Buttons, “ “Ashtrays.” The caption said: warren Burger’s most confusing decision.” 13. “Constitution for a United Republics of America: A Model for Discussion, Version XXXVII (1970),” in Center Magasine (Sept./Ott. 1970). 14.

Following a tip given to me, I had a year earlier predicted Burger’s decision to resign in ex- change for control of the Bicentennial Commission. 20 The Bicenten- nial of the Constitution is almost over as I write this. We shall see what time brings. What I expect is that sooner or later there will be a series of major national crises. These could then be orchestrated by the media to create public pressure to have a Constitutional Conven- tion. The Constitution could easily be scrapped, just as the Articles of Confederation were scrapped. It does no legal good to tell the del- egates that they are not allowed to offer a new Constitution. That strategy was taken by Congress in 1786. It failed. This substitution could very easily destroy the one source of le- gitimacy remaining to the U.S. national civil government. A new covenantal experiment, I predict, will not gain widespread public support once the headlines fade. There would be a growing con- frontation between Christians and humanists who run the various civil governments. Christians will see the openly humanist nature of the new Constitution; they are presently blinded by tradition and wishful thinking regarding the present Constitution. Thus, the hu- manist powers that be will lose the one thing that they desperately need: the legitimacy imparted by the national sovereign, We the People.” Couple this with a Holy Spirit-directed revival, and you could get a total transformation of the American political order. But this will take time. It will also take a recognition of the nature of the Masonic COUP &&tat of 1787-88.

It may well be that the U.S. Con- gress in 1787 would not have agreed to the necessary revisions: the strengthening of the executive, the abolition of the unanimous state agreement rule, the abolition of all internal tariffs, and the abolition of state government fiat (unbacked) paper money.

But the critics will not admit the truth, namely, that the U.S. Constitution is only the judicially official aspect of the story of political rule in America. The system of elitist control over national affairs in America which Georgetown Univer- sity’s Caroll Quigley wrote about favorably in Tragedy and Hope (1966), 2 ’ and which George Washington University’s Arthur Selwyn Miller wrote about favorably just before he died in 1988,22 is never mentioned in polite academic circles. This system of hidden hierar- chies is nonetheless the way our world works today. The inescapable political fact is this: there must always be repre- sentation. This representation can be open or hidden, or more likely, hidden with the illusion of being open. It is time for Christians to cease deluding themselves about the hidden hierarchies of the mod- ern democratic world. There will always be hierarchies; the question is: Will they be open or hidden? In modern democracy, where the political hierarchy is formally open, it is in fact secretly closed. It was planned that way, beginning no later than 1787. 21. Caroll Quigley, Tragedy and Hope.

The answer, it seems to me, must be in the negative – if we take any stock in the lessons of the human past. One cannot be cer- tain, of course; there is no sure way of catapulting ourselves into the future; no way of being confident that even the hardiest or most promising of current trends will continue indefinitely. But we can take some reasonable guidance, I believe, first from the fact that never in history have periods of culture such as our own lasted for very long. They are destroyed by all the forces which constitute their essence. How can any society or age last very long if it lacks or is steadily losing the minimal requirements for a society — such re- quirements being the very opposite of the egocentric and hedonistic elements which dominate Western culture today? Second, it is impossible to overlook at the present time a phe- nomenon that as recently as the 1940s we thought so improbable as to be unworthy of serious thought or discussion. I refer to the faint, possibly illusory, signs of the beginning of a religious renewal in Western civilization, notably in America. Whatever their future, the signs are present — visible in the currents of fundamentalism, pente- costalism, even millennialism found in certain sectors of Judaism and Christianity. Even the spread of the occult and the cult in the West could well be one of the signs of a religious renascence, for, as is well known, the birth of Christianity or rather its genesis as a world religion in Rome during and after the preaching of Paul was sur- rounded by a myriad of bizarre faiths and devotions.

This is equally true of institutions. Covenant-breaking man regards as preposterous any such view of biblical law as the only valid standard of moral progress in history.

No single human covenant is absolute; therefore, no single human institution is all-powerful. Thus, Christian liberty is liber~ under God and God’s law, administered by plural legal authorities. There is no doubt that Christianity teaches pluralism, but a very special kind of pluralism: plural institutions under God’s single com- prehensive law system. It does not teach a pluralism of law struc- tures, or a pluralism of moralities, for this sort of hypothetical legal . pluralism (as distinguished from institutional pluralism) is always either polytheistic or humanistic. 3 Christian people are required to take dominion over the earth by means of all three God-ordained in- stitutions, not just the Church, or just the State, or just the family. 1.

Changes in the weather as a result of the use of fossil fuels (the “greenhouse effect”) are in the newspapers because of international drought. Agricultural output may be endangered, long term, by weather changes and also by soil erosion. We are not sure. What Christians should be certain of is this: God has been plowing up our ethical~ erosion-prone world since World War I, and this process is accelerating. This has created a unique opportunity for Christian revival, but this time the revival could lead to a broad-based cultural transforma- tion. In short, revival could produce an international revolution: family by family, church by church, nation by nation. For a true so- cial revolution to take place, there must be a transformation of the legal order. This transformation takes several generations, but with- out it, there has been no revolution, only a COUP d’itat. 7 There is today an international crisis in the Western legal tradition. 8 This, far more than the build-up of nuclear weapons or the appearance of AIDS, testifies to the likelihood of a comprehensive, international revolution — not necessarily violent, but a revolution nonetheless. The Holy Spirit could produce such a revolution without firing a shot or launch- ing a missile. This is my prayer. It should be every Christian’s prayer.

They still pretend that Cicero is alive and well philoso- phically, and that Newton’s god is still out there somewhere, protect- ing mankind’s natural rights even as he occasionally shores up the declining universe. Christians have also been unwilling to accept biblical law as a replacement for the expired hybrid of natural law. They have clung to Locke’s worldview as if Hume and Kant had not destroyed it. They have clung to a Newtonian worldview as if it had not been both Unitarian and Deistic from the beginning, as if Hume 12 and Darwin and quantum physics had not made faith in it unten- able. They refuse to admit that there is nowhere for them to turn for guidance in developing a biblically believable social theory and workable social programs except to the case laws of the Old Testament. And so, Christians remain culturally impotent. Their only psy- chological solution to this visibly unpleasant condition has been to develop eschatologies of defeat that announce this cultural im- potence as God’s inevitable, predestined way. Even the Arminians insist that the cultural defeat of Christianity in this, the “Church Age,” is predestined by God.

If not, then why do antinomian Christians — liberals and conservatives, neo-evangelicals and fundamentalists — continue to ridicule Old Testament law?

Those who begin with the pre- supposition that a particular Old Testament law or God-required Hebrew practice was innately evil have already taken the first step toward Paine’s view: that the Bible is the word of a demon. Christians today are afraid of the laws in the Bible. They are ac- tually embarrassed by them. They do not recognize that biblical law is a two-edged sword of God’s judgment: blessing for the righteous, but cursing for the unrighteous (Rem. 13:1-7). They do not under- stand that God’s law-order for society is mercz~ul. For example, God re- quires the death penalty for kidnappers (Ex. 21:16). The death penalty used to be imposed on kidnappers in the United States, and kidnap- ping was rare. It is no longer imposed regularly, and kidnapping has become a blight. Kidnapping by terrorists in Europe is common- place. Who says that God’s law regarding kidnapping is too harsh? Harsher than kidnapping itself? So it is with all of God’s civil laws. They are merciful compared with the effects of unpunished evil. The modern world is Iearningjust how unmerciful a society can be that is not governed by biblical law. 17.

The Bible is a unit. It is a “package deal .“ The New Testament did not overturn the Old Testament; it is a commentay on the Old Testament. It tells us how to use the Old Testament properly in the period after the death and resurrection of Israel’s messiah, God’s Son. Jesus said: “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am come not to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise [way] pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whoso- ever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven” (Matt. 5:17-19). Christ took the Old Testament seriously enough to die for those condemned to the second death (Rev. 20:14) by its provisions. The Old Testament is not a discarded first draft of God’s Word. It is not “God’s Word (emeritus).” If anything, the New Testament law is more stringent than the Mosaic law, not less stringent. Paul writes that an elder cannot have more than one wife (I Tim. 3:2). The king in the Old Testament was forbidden to have multiple wives (Deut. 17:17). This was not a gen- eral law, unless we interpret the prohibition of Leviticus 18:18 as apply- ing to all additional wives, and not just to marrying a woman’s sister, as ethicist John Murray interprets it. 18 If we attempt to interpret Leviticus 18:18 in Murray’s way, the question inevitably arises: Why specify kings as being prohibited from becoming polygamists if the same law applied to all men anyway? Possibly to prohibit the system of political covenanting through marriage (Solomon is a good exam- ple here). In any case, there is no equally clear-cut Old Testament prohibition against polygamy comparable to I Timothy 3:2, which 18.

There are no more second-class wives. A Scare Word The word “theocracy” is a scare word that humanists and fright- ened Christians use to chase dedicated Christians away from areas of their God-given responsibility. The critics focus on politics and civil government as if God’s rule in this area were somehow evil. Be- cause almost all humanists today believe in salvation through legis- lation, 19 they necessarily believe that politics is the primary means of s’ocial healing. ZO The Marxists are the most consistent defenders of human transformation through political action: the religion of revo- lution. 21 Because Christians are today so used to thinking in these humanistic terms, they seldom think to themselves: ‘Wait a minute. I know that God rules the family, and the government of my family should reflect this fact. God also rules the Church, and the govern- ment of my church is supposed to reflect this fact. I know that God rules all civil governments, too. So why should it be evil for Chris- tians to work hard to see to it that the civil government reflects this fact, just as they do in their families, churches, and businesses?” In short, why should politics be outside the realm of God-honoring Christian action? 22 Humanist critics present Christians with a kind of mental image: a scarecrow that is locked in the stocks of Puritan New England. Every time a Christian walks by this scarecrow, a tape recorded message blares out: “Beware of theocracy! Beware of theocracy!” If 19.

I recommend the abolition of all direct taxation by any agency of civil government above the local township or county; every other level of civil government would be forced to seek its reve- nues by taxing the level of civil government immediately below it. Civil governments above the most local would have to live off the revenues collected from other civil governments. This would decen- tralize power with a vengeance. The Reconstructionists’ version of theocracy is a decentralized system of multiple competing govern- ments in which the modern messianic State and its economic subsi- dies would be dismantled. By modern political standards, such a vision of the shrinking of the centralized power of civil government is nothing short of utopian. In short, if the Reconstructionists’ version of theocracy were to be voted into operation, the tenured, subsidized intellectual class to which our academic critics belong would experience the end of its taxpayer-financed bonanza. An entire class would have to enter the competitive free market and seek productive employment. Con- sumers would reward former college professors in terms of what con- sumers want to buy, not what state legislatures want to buy. There would be no more compulsory education and no more tax support of existing schools. This fear, rather than the fear of theocratic tyranny, may well be the true underlying concern of our critics.

We must work within a covenantally alien system, and we must do so peace- fully. We expect positive feedback in history for covenantal faithful- ness.

Premillennialism and amillennialism both deny that the preach- ing of the gospel can ever bring a majority of people to faith in Christ, thereby bringing in the earthly kingdom of God in history on a voluntary basis, person by person, culture by culture. Premillen- nialist author Dave Hunt has gone so far as to argue that such a person-by-person extension of God’s kingdom is literally impossible for God to achieve. 31 Premillennialists have always maintained that in order to produce universal peace on earth, Jesus will have to im- pose a top-down bureaucracy when He comes to reign in person. 32 Peter Lalonde, released in early 1987, Hunt said: “Christ himself is physically here. And He has us, the redeemed in our resurrection bodies, that nobody can kill us. And we are helping Him to maintain order. He isjorcing this world to behave, and He gives a restoration of the Edenic state, so that the desert blossoms like a rose, and the lion lies down with the lamb, and you’ve got paradise on earth, once again, with Christ Himself maintaining it and, even better than the garden of Eden, Satan is locked up for a thousand years.” Dominion and the Cross, Tape Two of Dominion: The Word and the New World Ordm, op. cit., 1987. It should be pointed out that Hunt’s argument that resurrected saints will return to rule with Jesus during the earthIy millennium has long been rejected by dispensa- tional theologians at Dallas Theological Seminary. Resurrected saints will be dwell- ing in a place called the heavenly Jerusalem, argues J. Dwight Pentecost: “The Relation between Living and Resurrected Saints in The Millennium,” Bibliotheca Sacra, Vol. 117 (October 1960), pp. 335-37. See also John F. Walvoord, The Rapture @estion (rev. cd.; Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan Academie, 1979), pp. 86-87. 30. Oddly enough, Hunt also denies that there can ever be an earthly kingdom, even in the dispensational millennium. He says in his taped interview: ‘What hap- Dens at the end of this time. when Satan is loosed? He deceives the nations and like he sand of the seashore, so’many – a multitude. They gather their armies and come against Christ in Jerusalem. And, of course, that is when they finally have to be banished from God’s presence forever.

He cannot by legislation, or by political or military or coercive means, establish this kingdom.” Tape Two, Dominion and the Gloss. 31. “In fact, dominion – taking dominion and setting up the kingdom for Christ – is an impossibility, even for God. The millennial reign of Christ, far from being the kingdom, is actually the final proof of the incorrigible nature of the human heart, because Christ Himself can’t do what these people say they are going to do – New Agers or Manifested Sons.” (Verbal emphasis in the original interview.) Dominion and the Cross. 32. They have not taught, as popularizers like Hunt teach today, that resurrected Christians of the “Church Age” get to return to earth in perfect bodies to kick heads (or whatever) for Jesus. This is a new doctrine, one which Rev.

They insist (as postmillennialism also insists) that Jesus will physically appear only at the end of history at the final judgment. They therefore deny (in contrast to postmillennialism) the possibility of an earthly mani- festation of God’s comprehensive kingdom in history. Because of their denial of the widespread acceptance of the gos- pel at any point in history, premillennialists and amillennialists alike invariably associate the word “theocracy” with some sort of top- down, power-imposed, widely resisted rule that is imposed by an elite. Premillennialists accept this as a valid system of civil rule, but only if Christ personally and physically runs it from the top of the bureaucratic pyramid. Amillennialists deny that Christ will ever do this in history, so they deny bureaucratic theocracy’s legitimacy at any point in the pre-final judgment future. The Wwk of the Ho~ Spirit First, we Calvinistic postmillennialists disagree with both groups concerning the supposed impotence of the gospel in history in changing whole societies, person by person, covenant institution by covenant institution. We believe that the Holy Spirit will impose His will on the recalcitrant hearts of huge numbers of people, just as He has always imposed His will on each recalcitrant heart every time He has saved anyone from his sins. God is utterly sovereign in election and salva- tion. He changes people’s hearts, transforming them so that they can respond in faith to the free offer of the gospel. “The king’s heart is in the hand of the L ORD , as the rivers of water: he turneth it whither- soever he will” (Prov. 21:1). This is the only way anyone has ever been saved, for the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit, for they are foolishness to him (I Cor. 2:14). The natural man does not partially receive the things of the Spirit in his unsaved state; he rejects the very idea that such a wrathful God exists or that his own condition warrants such negative sanctions. Thus, the unsaved person needs to be transformed b~ore he or she can accept the gospel. First comes God’s irresistible saving grace; then comes man’s response: internal faith in Jesus Christ. In short, man does not have free (autonomous) will. Paul was correct. 33 Augustine was therefore 33. “(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;) It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. As it is written,"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"The Restoration of Biblical Pluralism 589 correct against Pelagius; Luther was correct against Erasmus; Calvin was correct against Pighius; and the Puritans were correct against the latitudinarians. Man’s lack of free will is why God can easily change the spiritual condition of this world in order to give the human race freedom. Second, because we Calvinistic Christian Reconstructionists be- lieve that the Holy Spirit forces hearts to change – the doctrine of ir- resistible grace — we also believe that human institutions are not allowed to seek to coerce men’s hearts and minds. Such coercion o~the human will– its transformation prior to the permission of the individ- ual whose will is being transformed — is a monopo~ that belongs exclu- sive~ to God. Men must recognize that coercion is an inescapable concept in history. It is never a question of coercion vs. no coercion. It is always a question of whose coercion. Reconstructionists affirm the power of the Holy Spirit to change men’s souls – to declare judicially that they are saved, and therefore possess Christ’s righteousness — and to change them ethically at the point of their ethical transformation. Those who deny this exclusive power of the Spirit in transforming the lives of covenant-breakers instinctively expect to find coercion some- where else: in human institutions — either humanist or “theocratic- bureaucratic” – or in a future personal kingdom ruled by Christ in Person. Third, because we postmillennialists find it taught in the Bible that there will be a future outpouring of this soul-transforming Holy Spirit — the only possible basis of the Bible’s prophesied millennial blessings — we disagree with premillennialist and amillennialists concerning the limited extent of the Spirit’s work in the future. The kingdom will not be brought in by a bureaucratic theocratic regime, but by the heart-transforming work of the Holy Spirit. We therefore Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. What shall we say then? Is there unright- eousness with God? God forbid. For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. Therefore bath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. Thou wilt say then unto me, Why cloth he yet find fault? For who bath resisted his will? Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonor?” (9:11-21)."},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"590 POLITICAL POLYTHEISM disagree with them concerning the supposed necessity of defining theocracy as a top-down social transformation. If God’s kingdom rule is to be widespread in its influence in society, this transforma- tion must be from the bottom-up: se~-government under God. So, we do not call for a theocratic bureaucracy, either now or in the future. Such a top-down bureaucracy is not called for in the Bible, is impos- sible to maintain without unlawful coercion, and is not necessary to impose to bring in the kingdom. Christian Reconstructionists “call instead for a decentralized, international, theocratic republic. 34 Such a republic is ethically necessary, now and in the future, and it will be historically possible in the future, when the Holy Spirit begins His visibly triumphant sweep of the nations. If postmillennialism is incorrect, and the Holy Spirit does not act to bring huge numbers of people to eternal life, then Christians must be content with only partial social reconstruction, and only partial external blessings from God. The earthly manifestations of God’s heavenly kingdom will necessarily be limited. When we pray, ‘Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven: we should expect God to answer this prayer. Not all Christians pray this prayer. Many dispensationalists do not, saying that it is a Jewish-era prayer of Jesus, not a “Church Age” prayer. They at least are consist- ent. Many less consistent Christians teach that God will never answer this prayer before Jesus comes again physically to rule the world in person (amillennialists and premillennialists), yet they still ritually pray this prayer in church. If they are correct about the earthly king- dom of God, then we will not see the pre-second coming advent of a holy commonwealth in which God’s laws are honored. We must con- tent ourselves with less. It is not possible to ramrod God’s blessings from the top down, unless you are God. (If you are God, this ramrodding is the only sys- tem that works, convert by convert. ) Only humanists believe that man is God. They do indeed believe in social salvation through ram- rodding by the State. Christians are simply trying to get the ramrod away from them and melt it down. This melted ramrod could then be used to make a great grave marker for humanism: “The God That Failed.” 34. E. C.

What the Bible teaches is that this world is divided ethical~ and per- sonal@ God vs. Satan, right vs. wrong, freedom vs. tyranny. The conflict between God and Satan will end at the final judgment. Whenever Christians substitute some other form of dualism for ethi- cal dualism, they fall into heresy and suffer the consequences. That is what has happened today. We are suffering from revived versions of ancient heresies. Marciont Dualism The Old Testament was written by the same God who wrote the New Testament. There were not two Gods in history, meaning there was no dualism or radical split between the two testamental periods. There is only one God, in time and eternity. This idea has had opposition throughout Church history. An an- cient two-gods heresy was first promoted in the Church about a cen- tury after Christ’s crucifixion, and the Church has always regarded it as just that, a heresy. It was proposed by a man named Marcion. Basically, this heresy teaches that there are two completely different law systems in the Bible: Old Testament law and New Testament law (or non-law). But Marcion took the logic of his position all the way. He argued that two law systems means two gods. The god of wrath wrote the Old Testament, and the god of mercy wrote the New Testament. In short: “two laws-two gods.” You would be surprised how many Christians still believe some- thing dangerously close to Marcionism: not a two-gods view, ex- actly, but a “God-who-changed-all-His-rules” sort of view. They begin with the accurate teach;ng that the ceremonial laws of the Old Testament were fulfilled by Christ, and therefore that the unchanging princ@es of worship are applied d$erent~ in the New Testament, bu~ then they erroneously conclude that the whole Old Testament sys- tem of civil law was dropped by God, and nothing biblical was put in its place. In other words, God created a sort of vacuum for State law. This idea turns civil law-making over to Satan. In our day, this means that civil law-making is turned over to humanism. Christians haue unz.witting~ become the philosophical allies of the humanists with respect to civil law. With respect to their doctrine of the State, therefore, most Christians hold what is in effect a two-gods view of the Bible."},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"592 POLITICAL POLYTHEISM Gnostic Dualism Another ancient heresy that is still with us is Gnosticism. It be- came a major threat to the early Church almost from the beginning. It was also a form of dualism, a theory of a radical split. The gnostics taught that the split is between evil matter and good spirit. Thus, their goal was to escape this material world through other-worldly exercises that punish the body. They believed in retreatfrom the world of human consicts and responsibili~. Some of these ideas got into the Church, and people started doing ridiculous things. So-called “pillar saints” became temporarily popular in the fifth century, A . D . A “saint” would sit on a platform on top of a pole for several decades without coming down. This was considered very spiritual. 35 (Who fed them? Who cleaned up after them?) Thus, many Christians came to view “the world” as something permanently outside the kingdom of God. They believed that this hostile, forever-evil world cannot be redeemed, reformed, and reconstructed. At best, it can be subdued by power (maybe). Jesus did not really die for it, and it cannot be healed. This dualistic view of the world vs. God’s kingdom narrowly restricted any earthly man- ifestation of God’s kingdom. Christians who were influenced by Gnosticism concluded that God’s kingdom refers only to the institu- tional Church. They argued that the institutional Church is the on~ manifestation of God’s kingdom. This led to two opposite and equally evil conclusions. First, power religionists who accepted this definition of God’s kingdom tried to put the institutional Church in charge of everything, since it is supposedly “the only manifestation of God’s kingdom on earth.” To subdue the supposedly unredeemable world, which is forever outside the kingdom, the institutional Church has to rule with the sword. The institutional Church must give orders to the State, and the State must enforce these orders with the sword. 36 The institutional Church must therefore concentrate political and economic power.

They abandoned the world to evil tyrants. What then becomes of liberty? What becomes of the idea of God’s progressive restoration of all things under Jesus Christ ? What, finally, becomes of the idea of biblical dominion? When Christians improperly narrow their definition of the king- dom of God, the visible influence of this comprehensive kingdom (both spiritual and institutional at the same time) begins to shrivel up. The first heresy leads to tyranny by the Church, and the second heresy leads to tyranny over the Church. Both of these narrow defini- tions of God’s kingdom destroy the liberty of the responsible Chris- tian man, self-governed under God and God’s law. Manichaean Dualism The last ancient pagan idea that still lives on is also a variant of dualism: matter vs. spirit. It teaches that God and Satan, good and evil, are forever locked in combat, and that good never triumphs over evil. The Persian religion of Zoroastrianism has held such a view for over 2,500 years. The incredibly popular “Star Wars” movies were based on this view of the world: the “dark” side of “the force” against its “light” side. In modern versions of this ancient dual- ism, the “force” is usually seen as itself impersonal: individuals person- alize either the dark side or the light side by “plugging into” its power. There are millions of Christians who have adopted a very pessi- mistic version of this dualism, though not in an impersonal form. God’s kingdom is battling Satan’s, and God’s is losing. History is not going to get better. In fact, things are going to get a lot worse exter- nally. Evil will visibly push good into the shadows. The Church is like a band of soldiers who are surrounded by a huge army of In- dians. We can’t win boys, so hold the fort until Jesus and the angels come to rescue us!” That does not sound like Abraham, Moses, Joshua, Gideon, and David, does it? Christians read to their children the children’s favor- ite story, David and Goliath, yet in their own lives, millions of Chris- tian parents really think that the Goliaths of this world are the un- beatable earthly winners.

I call this Ath.anasian pluralism. The basic covenant issue is the Trinity. The earliest Church creeds will do quite well as judicial screening devices, at least for the first few centuries of the millennium. It is not my opin- ion that in a system of Athanasian pluralism, in the words of House and Ice, “heresy is apparently transformed from a punishable crime into ‘treason.’ “ 37 Apparently? Apparent to whom? What they are do- ing here is superimposing their view of the coming premillennial bu- reaucratic kingdom on top of Reconstruction’s blueprint for a theo- cratic republic. This sort of swift justice is how they expect Jesus to run things from his throne in Jerusalem. It is our view that uttering heretical opinions – yes, even theological opinions as utterly wrong- headed as those that House and Ice proclaims – would not be civil crimes at all. The civil government would have nothing to say about it. Those who say that Christian Reconstructionists would “kill any- one who is not a Reconstructionist” are blowing smoke. They are bearing false witness against their neighbors. Where are their foot- notes proving such an accusation? There are none. What Christian Reconstructionists are saying is that the mark of judicial sovereignty in a Christian civilization will be membership in a Ti-initarian church. The issue here is civil sanctions. Those not for- mally under God’s eternal sanctions — the ecclesiastical marks of baptism and regular holy communion – in a Trinitarian society would not be biblically authorized to impose God’s negative civil sanctions. Everyone else would have the same civil liberties guaran- teed to strangers within the gates in Old Covenant Israel, beginning with equality before the civil law (Ex. 12:49). Those Christians who believe that Old Covenant Israel was a tyranny whenever biblical law was being honored will have to argue about this with God on judgment day. 37.

I think the best way to understand this principle of the minimal confession is to consider the case of the concentration camp. A Christian living as a prisoner in such a camp would be in need of fellowship and the sacraments. The question he would have to ask himself is this one: ‘What is the minimal confessional require- ment placed on me by God that would enable me to locate another communicant church member?” I see no alternative: to defend the Church in the concentration camp, it would have to be a Ti-initarian confession. To make it less than Trinitarian would be to destroy the integrity of the Church; to make it more would be to limit the au- thorit y of the Church and reduce the judicial impact of its sanction, the Lord’s Supper. We are therefore once again brought back to the question ofjudi- cial sanctions, the stumbling block of the Protestant era. We need to understand that the sacraments are judicial, not merely memorial (nominalism) and not “infusional” (realism). They are judicial and covenantal. They identify the person who acknowledges that he or she is under God’s historical and eternal sanctions, both positive and negative. By placing oneself under these sanctions, the person is en- abled to bring God’s dominion covenant into effect. He works out his faith in fear and trembling under God (Phil. 2:12). He executes judgment in history as a covenant-keeper under God’s sanctions. We acknowledge that a person under God’s sacramental cove- nant obligations aid blessings has implicitly and visibly affirmed the covenant’s sanctions in history. If a person has lawful access to the sacraments, what would lawfully keep him from exercising the church franchise? Only his refusal to pay the required tithe. This raises the question of the suffrage and taxation. Judicial Sanctions and Tuation Being a communicant church member should not automatically give that person the right to vote in church elections. For instance, baptized communicant children do not vote in church elections; chil- dren also do not vote in humanist democracies. Presumably, senile and retarded people are not allowed to vote in church elections; it would be strange if they were allowed to vote in democracies, although these days, it is probably illegal to exclude them. There are additional church qualifications for voting besides access to the Lord’s Table. So there should also be for access to the political fran- chise in a theocratic republic."},{"pageNumber":611,"pageContent":"596 POLITICAL POLYTHEISM Those who refuse to pay their tithes to their local church should not be allowed to vote in church elections. Why not? Because of the covenantal principle of sanctions. If a person refuses to be under the negative sanctions of membership (paying tithes), he should not be allowed to impose church judicial sanctions. 3g The same is true of civil government. The alternative view of the franchise leads straight to socialism and communism. Karl Marx declared in 1843 that once a society has accepted the political principle that the franchise need not be restricted to property owners and taxpayers, it has in princi- ple already accepted the abolition of private property. “The state as a state annuls, for instance, private property, man declares by political means that private property is abolished as soon as the property qualt#i- cation for the right to elect or be elected is abolished, as has occurred in many states of North America. . . . Is not private property abol- ished in idea if the non-property owner has become the legislator for the property owner? The Propdy qualification for the suffrage is the last political form of giving recognition to private property.”w This principle of voting apart from equal-percentage taxpaying is inherently demonic. God is the Creator and Owner of the world. He delegated to man certain derivative rights of ownership-steward- ship. Satan is a trespassing thief. He therefore proclaims the politics of pure democracy, the politics of open access to the ballot box by those who do not pay an equal share of taxes. He also proclaims the graduated income tax: richer people pay a higher percentage of their income to the State. Thus, Marx was consistent; as a God-hater, he proclaimed his hatred of private property. He also proclaimed his hatred of the property qualification for voting. The principle of suffrage is covenantal: one must be formally under the eternal sanctions of God in order lawfully to execute the sanctions of God, in both Church and State. *i One must be under the penalties of equal-percentage taxation in order to have authority 39.

The family was created before either Church or State, and the dominion covenant was imposed on the family above all. The domin- ion covenant is a general covenant; it is given to mankind in general (Gen. 1:26-28; 9:1-17). This, above all, is why the family is neither a Church nor a State.

The biblical model for a theocratic republic would restrict voting to those who are voting (i.e., tithe-paying) members of local churches, and who are also tax- paying citizens. The payment of taxes is not sufficient to gain a per- son access to the ballot box; resident aliens pay taxes today, but they do not legally vote. There must be something more: a voluntary acceptance of the national covenant. So it is with theocratic republic- anism, but with this added provision: there must also be a voluntary acceptance of the Church covenant. Strict voluntarism means judi- cial independence, i.e., adult status. In Old Testament Israel, this occurred at age 20, when a man became eligible for military num- bering (Ex. 30:14). There seems to be no New Testament reason to change this age standard. Modern humanist political liberals and their Christian academic accomplices hate such a conclusion of covenantal politics with a pas- sion because they hate covenant theology with a passion. They hate the idea of covenant sanctions. The Theocratic Strategy Is Not Primarily Political Biblical theocracy is not primarily political, so the biblical theo- cratic strategy shouldn’t be, either. Theocracy means “God rules .“ God rules theocratically over everything. In God’s kingdom, politics is supposed to be only a small part of life. Taxes are to be low; the State’s influence is to be minimal. It should only impose negative sanctions; it is not to remain a modern welfare State. Family life, business, education, the arts, leisure, and just about everything else should be removed from State financing and therefore from direct State control. It is the humanist who believes in salvation by law, not the Christian. The humanist believes in the messianic State, not the Christian. The only reason that theocracy appears today to be pri- marily a political issue is that the biblical theocrat wants to shrink the State drastically. This is an affront to the modern humanist, who equates politics with religion. The critics of Christian Reconstructionism seldom read any of the books written by Christian Reconstructionists. Only a few have been willing to read ten or fifteen, which is the minimum required, since we have about a hundred available, if you count the journals.

I am writing for those who take seriously this book’s covenantal theology, but who may be confused about where to begin a program of applied covenantalism. The way to gain a Trinitarian national covenant is first to suc- ceed visibly and undeniably in the other areas of life. Men must see the positive fruits of Christianity before they commit themselves to its negative sanctions. They must see, Deuteronomy 4:5-8 says, that biblical justice – and not just biblical civil justice – is the best avail- able alternative to tyranny and misery. There are three covenantal institutions: Church, family, and State. Therefore, I propose preliminary reforms in these three insti- tutions based on the major area of theological confusion and rebel- lion during the Protestant era: the question of sanctions. I begin with the Church because the Church is God’s model for the other two institutions. It extends into eternity; the other two do not. God begins bringing His historical sanctions, positive and negative, to those who are formally covenanted with Him ecclesiastically. “For the time is come hat judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?” (1 Pet. 4:17). Church Sanctions This is the area of the sacraments. Church discipline must be im- posed in terms of the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper. Because the churches have not taken seriously baptism, the Lord’s Supper, membership rolls, and excommunication for well over two centuries, the civil government has had no clear model. When the churches do start taking these things seriously, persecution and lawsuits against Church leaders will begin. Our enemies who now control civil government will instinctively perceive the threat to their power, and they will take steps to stop it. They cannot safely allow the Church to begin imposing sanctions against the sins of this age. This is not the place to debate baptism. Baptism is the rite by which the dual judicial sanctions of the covenant — blessings and cursings — are imposed on people: either directly on adults or repre- sentatively on children through a baptized parent. This representa- tion principle is valid. Just as the centurion’s servant was healed through the centurion’s faith in Jesus Christ and his willingness to submit to Christ publicly, even though the servant was absent and"},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"The Restoration of Biblical Pluralism 599 had no knowledge of what was going on (Luke 7), so is the judicial au- thority of Christ transferred through the sacrament in infant baptism. Baptism does not save anyone; it merely places people under the formal, legal, covenantal sanctions of God. Those legally under a Christian’s covenantal authority in a family should be baptized when the head of the household is, even if the subordinate is not a believer. The issue is not saving faith for those under lawful covenantal au- thority; the issue is obedience to God3 law within a covenantal hierarchy. Baptism of infants is therefore mandatory.4z Obviously, children of non-communicant members have no right to the sacrament of bap- tism – a denial of original halfway covenantalism in New England. But if this is true, then infant communion or very young child communion is equally mandatory, a fact that has not been accepted by modern “half Way covenant” Presbyterianism. 43 Churches give communion to retarded and senile people who do not know what is going on or what is being symbolized; churches have the same obli- gation to intellectually immature children of a communicant mem- ber. This is so obvious that only halfway covenant theology blinds the modern Church to the nature of communion. The modern Church is still hypnotized by the Greek ideal of the primacy of the intellect rather than the primacy of the covenant. Any church that refuses to give communion based on baptism and church member- ship alone, and then justifies itself in terms of the intellect, is con- demning itself by “endangering the souls of intellectually incompetent retarded and senile people” if it continues to serve them communion. The churches must move to infant baptism and weekly commun- ion. (Weekly communion was John Calvin’s choice, but the civil magistrates of Geneva prohibited this practice. They saw the threat to their authority.) Churches may have to do this in steps, just as the defenders of theocratic republicanism should move only as the politi- cal environment allows. We are not to become revolutionaries. But the long-term goal is clear: infant baptism and also week~ communion for all baptized church members. If God’s people reject the legitimacy and necessity of the sanctions of covenant theology in the churches, then surely they will not persuade anyone else regarding the sanctions of covenant theology in civil government. Once this is done, the negative sanction of public excommunica- tion will become meaningful. People must be consigned to hell ver- 42. Sutton, That You May Prosper, Appendix 9. 43.

This is also not done today. The modern Church simply pays no attention to God’s ecclesiastical sanctions. Therefore, pagans pay very little at- tention to the churches. Why should they? The church is like an ar- my without hierarchical order and without sanctions against mutiny. Such an army cannot win a battle. Pagans instinctively recognize this; Christians may also sense it, but then they blame eschatology rather than their own judicial cowardice. Reform must begin with self-government under God’s law. l?ami~ Sanctions Anyone who gets a divorce without biblical justification should be brought under public sanctions, up to and including excommuni- cation. First, however, Church leaders need to know what sins are grounds for divorce. They do not know the answer here, so the churches refuse to enforce sanctions against divorce and remar- riage. 44 These sanctions are primarily Church sanctions brought against deviant family members in order to protect the innocent vic- tims. What about the imposition of sanctions by the family? The major areas of open rebellion here involve sanctions as they relate to inheritance: parents’ compromise with taxpayer-financed education and their compromise with mixed marriages. The second case is most obvious. “Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship bath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion bath light with dark- ness? (II Cor. 6:14). This applies immediately to the two voluntary covenantal institutions — Church and family — and it ought to apply eventually to the area of civil government with respect to voting. 45 Parents should not finance, attend, or in any way sanction a marriage of a communicant member child to anyone who is not a communi- cant member of a Trinitarian church. That Christian parents refuse to honor this requirement is one reason why they are losing their children. They are afraid to apply sanctions. They think this would 44. Ray R.

So their children conclude that God really does not care if they marry pagans, since God’s lawful representatives over them, parents and churches, do not care enough to threaten public sanctions. Church leaders should prohibit parents from participating in such wedding ceremonies. When a father symbolically delivers his daughter to the covenantal authority of a pagan husband, he is cove- nantall y sending her into bondage, a symbol of hell. Christian par- ents are so utterly ignorant of covenant theology and the concept of authority and sanctions that they do this without a thought. The second area of family responsibility is also flagrantly ig- nored: the responsibility of parents to educate their children. 46 Christian parents send their children into the judicially and self- consciously pagan environment of the public schools. Parents are not acting faithfully as representatives when they do this. They are tithing their children to the State. They are tempting God to break the covenantal inheritance of their children. Until the vast majority of Christians pull their children out of the public schools, there will be no possibility of creating a theocratic republic. The Unitarians who invented modern public education in the 11330’s and the Masons in churches today who religiously support the public schools have done their covenantal work well. Reform must begin with self-government under God’s law. Civil Sanctions There is no question where the most flagrant violation of God’s covenantal standards is in modern politics: the legalization of abor- tion. The pagans have attacked the fifth point of the covenant — con- tinuity and inheritance — at its most vulnerable point: the mother’s womb. The pagans know exactly what they are doing. 47 It is not ran- dom that in the United States, support for abortion on demand was only 2470 among those who regard religion as a major aspect of their lives, 42 YO among those who said religion is “somewhat important,” 4570 among those who said it is “somewhat unimportant ,“ and 6670 among those who said religion is “very unimportant .“ 48 Christians 46.

They are more afraid of the employment sanctions or declining membership sanc- tions that pro-death or anti-involvement congregations can bring against them. It is like pastors in the American South in 1859: they refused to preach against slavery. So, God brought negative military sanctions from the north. He had done this before. “Then the L ORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land” (Jer. 1:14). When the U.S. Supreme Court in 1973 made illegal all state and local civil sanctions against the practice of abortion, it thereby sanc- tioned murder. There is no neutrality. This ethical fact is clearer on the abortionists’ table than anywhere else in America. This is why a growing number of Christians have been mobilized on this point. But this is still a minority of Christians in America. We need prayer in the churches that God will withhold His judg- ments in history against the United States so that Christians can gain more time to fight this intolerable evil. If Christians do this, they will step by step be led to the philosophy of Trinitarian politics and away from political pluralism. This is what the abortionists failed to recognize in time.

Conclusion We must not come to the Old Testament with a sense of fear and loathing. The Old Testament provides us with a vision of victory and the tools of dominion, namely, God’s laws. These laws are not a threat to us as Christians; they are the foundation of our efforts to reconstruct society. Christians have not wanted to think about God’s law.

Christians have preferred to comfort themselves as they have sat in their rocking chairs in the shadows of history, rocking themselves back and forth, and saying over and over: “I am not a theocrat. I am not a theocrat.” What this phrase means is simple: God does not govern the world, so Christians are of the hook. But what if God does rule? What if He has given us the unchang- ing laws by which He expects His people to rule? What if He has given us the tools of dominion, and we have left them in the rain to rust? What will He do with our generation? Just what He did with Moses’ generation: He will leave them behind to die in the wilderness. Christians in the Protestant era have not wanted to think about God’s sanctions in history. This has been the number-one ethical, theological, and institutional problem ever since the Protestant Ref- ormation: the nature of legitimate sanctions in Church and State. (The Roman Church abandoned biblical law early in the Middle Ages; this rejection of point three of the biblical covenant has been an ecumenical sin of omission ever since. ) Because Christians have self-consciously refused to exercise God’s sanctions in history — in Church, State, and family – we are now facing an escalating series of crises in Church, State, and family.

To deny judgment is to deny value and meaning. Without judgment, there can be no cultural progress, and the only valid form of judgment is that which is grounded in the word of God. The general revelation of God to mankind enabled some cultures to prog- ress to a point, until the relativism inherent in man’s original sin, his desire to be his own god (Gen. 3:5), subverted judgment in his society. With relativism came stagnation and deterioration. Moreover, judgment and salvation cannot be separated from one another. Those theologies which hold to judgment, while having a limited view of salvation, as witness premillennial and amillennial theologies, cut the vital nerve of both doctrines. Only as man has a total concept of salvation, of victory in time and eternity, can he apply a total concept of judgment to every sphere of life. Judgment is of ne- cessity total wherever it is held that every sphere of life must be brought into captivity to Christ, because every sphere must manifest His sal- vation as an aspect of His new creation. A doctrine of salvation which calls for man’s redemption, and limits that redemption to his soul now and his body in the general resurrection, is defective. The redeemed man will of necessity, because it is basic to his life, work to bring re- demption to every sphere and area of life as an aspect of his creation mandate. The redeemed man’s warfare against the powers of evil is not “after the flesh,” i.e., does not rely on human resources, but relies rather on the supernatural power of God.

All other es- chatologies are incorrect. (Why beat around the bush? ,“ I always say.) Only postmillennialism affirms and explains both the biblical doctrine of historic kingdom continuity (Matt. 13:24-30; 36-43), which premillennialism denies, and also the biblical doctrine of God’s ex- ternal covenant sanctions in history, which amillennialism denies. 1 I do not hold my eschatology because of its by-products, such as psychological motivation to work hard for God. I hold it because it is what the Bible teaches. This does not mean that I do not appreciate the by-products. I do. I refer to them frequently in my writings. Men do need motivation, and this is why God gives us sanctions in history and eternity: positive (blessings) and negative (cursings). What I am attempting to do with my life is to publish Christian worldview materials that will lead to the steady replacement of the humanist intellectual foundations of modern civilization. The arena of conflict is nothing less than world civilization. The issue is the kingdom of God, both in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18). There are many books that deal with the kingdom of God, but my view of the kingdom of God as it is visibly manifested in history is simple: it is God’s authorized and morally required civilization. It is simultaneously internal (world-and-life view), ethical (a moral law-order), and insti- tutional (covenantal judicial relationships). This is denied, either ex- plicitly or implicitly, by all those who deny postmillennialism. Amillennial “Victory” Archibald Hughes, an amillennialist, has written xl New Heaven and a New Earth. He subtitles this, An Introductory Study of the Second Aduent.z One would think that in a book with this title, the author would devote at least a chapter to Isaiah 65 and 66, since these two chapters deal specifically with the New Heaven and New Earth. Hughes did not devote even a paragraph to this section of the Old Testament, despite the fact that it is one of only three passages in the Bible that deals with the New Heaven and the New Earth.

He would have to come out and say that all the historically specific language is really symbolic. To argue such a position is to argue nonsense in public; thus, he simply refused to discuss the passage. It is this passage, more than any other in the Bible, that catego- rically refutes amillennialism. This passage deserves a whole vol- ume; instead, it receives the silent treatment. Instead of dealing with the text that speaks of tke positive sanction of the kingdom of God in history, Hughes removes God’s kingdom entirely from history: “Fur- ther, the Kingdom is no longer of the earth, earthly, but of God and heavenly, being the Kingdom of God and Heaven.” 3 The blessings of God are equally ethereal: “At present spiritual blessings are en- joyed by faith without sight, but in the New Heavens and the New Earth all will be visible, but that which will be seen will not be that of the past old order but the transformed glorified creation — a truly lit- eral spiritual creation.”4 In short, there is no continui~ between history’s blessings and heavent blessings. This is why amillennialism, for all its public denial of premillennialism’s kingdom discontinuity – bless- ings in history and God’s civic negative sanctions in history — is itself radically discontinuous. There are no positive kingdom sanctions in histo~ for amillennialism. Because of this radical discontinuity of sanctions, the amillennialist also asserts a radical discontinuity of ethics: no Old Testament civil stipulations for the New Testament era. The’ Calyinist amillennialist affirms one half of point one of the biblical covenant: the transcendent sovereignty of God. This sover- eign y, however, is supposedly not manifested in New Covenant kingdom history, i.e., there is no visible sign of God’sjudicial presence in this era of history. We see this position articulated clearly in the book by Raymond Zorn on the kingdom of God. Zorn begins his amillennial study with these words: “In the broadest sense God’s Kingdom refers to the most extended reaches of His sovereignty. As Psalm 103:19 puts it, ‘The Lord bath prepared his throne in the heav- ens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.’”5 The kingdom of God is all- 3. Hughes, New Heaven, p. 160. 4. Ibid., p. 161. 5.

In his view, God remains throughout history a king with universal claims and declining territory. Zorn speaks of historical victory only with respect to the internal realm of the spirit of the Christian and the narrowly defined institutional Church; exter- nall y, kingdom victory takes place only when history ends, after the final judgment. So, what Zorn gives us in the large print – kingdom universalist and the language of optimism — he takes away in the fine print. This self-conscious and utterly deceptive tactic is adopted by most Calvin- istic amillennialists, who recognize how depressing it is to think about the historical implications of their eschatology, so they disguise these implications in the language of optimism. 7 (Van Til is the main exception; he tells us in his book, Common Grace, that there is no pos- sible earthly hope for Christians, culturally speaking; it has been all downhill since the cross, and this will continue. ) Nevertheless, the traditional Calvinistic amillennialist is correct in his assessment of the transcendent extent of God’s kingdom. It is indeed universal. Orthodox Jews also share something like this view. as his self-proclaimed sovereignty.

It therefore has no way of calling fallen man’s attention to God’s judicial presence in New Testament era history. The best that the amillennialist can say about kingdom sanctions is that God used to bring temporal sanc- tions in history, but only in tiny Israel, nowhere else (except at the Flood, a one-time event until the final judgment). Amillennialism therefore denies the second half of point one of the biblical covenant: God’s covenantal presence in history. Because of this view of sanc- tions, amillennialism judicially turns over history to the devil, and it does so explicitly. Amillennialism’s eschatology is a product of its view of covenant sanctions in history. Evil men become more power- ful as time goes on, while covenant-keepers become culturally impo- tent.

Cornelius Van Til, who died in 1987, has issued this profound warning: “The temptation is very great for the believers in these times when the Church is in apostasy, and its conquest of the world for Christ seems to be losing out, that they shall spend a great deal of their time in passive waiting instead of in active service. Another danger that lurks at a time of apostasy is that the few faith- ful ones give up the comprehensive ideal of the kingdom and limit themselves to the saving of individual souls.” 12 We need a compre- hensive revival that will produce comprehensive redemption. 13 We must understand from the beginning that the message of the kingdom of God rests on a concept of salvation which is supernatural~ imparted, not political y imparted. The kingdom of God is catego- rically not a narrow political program of social transformation; it is rather a supernaturally imposed salvational program that inevitably produces world-changing political, social, legal, and economic effects. Geerhardus Vos was correct: “The kingdom represents the specifically evangelical element in our Lord’s teaching. . . .

Christians should recognize the extent of the despair that has engulfed those who have rejected the idea that the Bible is the infallible word of God. An example of such despair is the following: We live in a time in which old perspectives informing our understand- ing of the world have been seriously shaken by events of modern times. In many cases these old perspectives have collapsed; they no longer hold as our centers. . . . Against the backdrop of such events, an erosion of tradi- tional values has taken place — an erosion which has left us feeling that we [are] adrift in a sea of relativity in which anything, including such evils as the holocaust or nuclear war might be rationalized as “necessary.” It is with this experience that we know that the cultural foundations have been shaken. We know that we are no longer guided by a vision of coherence and relatedness concerning our individual existence. We know that we are no longer bound together by a set of values infused with a common sense of des~iny. Our seise of destiny, if any, is dominated by an uneasiness and sense of foreboding about the future. The future itself is now feared by many as the ultimate danger to the fragile hold we have on whatever secur- ity we have achieved in the present. All of this has left some to question the meaning of their endeavors, while it has left many with a sense of isolation and loneliness. The irony is that this new sense of insecurity has come at a 17.

The first is taking place visibly, the second is a growing possibility, 19 and the third, revival, is also becoming more likely. Sociologist Robert Nisbet asks this question: “[W]hat is the future of the idea of progress?

If the roots are dying, as they would appear to be at the present time, how can there be shrub and foliage?”zo But, he then asks, “is this contemporary Western cul- ture likely to continue for long?

A successful harvesting operation requires tools. To take advan- tage of this unique historical opportunity, Christians need tools of dominion –blueprints for the reconstruction of the world. But Christians today do not see that God has given them the tools of do- minion, His revealed law.23 They agree with the humanists who in turn agree among themselves, above all, that the Bible offers society no specific legal standards for comprehensive reform and reconstruc- tion. They agree with such statements as the one made by the editor of The Journal of Law and Religion, who is also a professor of C onstitu- tional law at a Catholic law school: First, I assume that the Bible is not a detailed historical blueprint for American society, and that it does not contain much concrete guidance for the resolution of specific political conflicts or constitutional difficulties such as slavery and racism, sexism and equal opportunity to participate in soci- ety.

Contextual leaps from the situations in which the biblical authors wrote to the situations with which we find ourselves faced are likewise to be avoided .24 This hatred of God’s law has affected millions of Christians who sing the old hymn, “O How Love I Thy Law.” Even when they do not actively hate it (and most do), they are simply afraid of God’s law. They have not studied it, and they have been beaten into intel- lectual submission by humanists, Christian antinomians, and those who fear personal and cultural responsibility.

We have been sidetracked for far too long by halfway covenant theologies. To expect men to sacrifice their lives, fortunes, and reputations for the sake of a predestined lost cause is naive. There is no surer way to shrink churches and their cultural influence than to combine Calvin’s doctrine of predestination with Luther’s doctrine of amillen- nialism. This is what Continental (Dutch) Calvinism has done for three centuries, and the result has been disastrous: the creation of a ghetto mentality. 25 It is the mentality of the besieged fortress or wagon train. If Noah had been told by God that no dove would ever return with an olive branch in its beak, he would have become a prime candidate for membership in the Protestant Reformed Church. The American Presbyterian tradition, both Northern2c and Southern,z7 up until World War I or perhaps the Great Depression, generally rejected this amillennial view of eschatology. It was post- millennialism that had dominated both Great Awakenings. 25 It was postmillennialism which was characteristic of the Scottish Cove- nanted movement. Presbyterian Christians believed in the crown rights of King Jesus, not just in heaven but on earth, too. They be- lieved that history would reflect a progressive extension of God’s kingdom. When they began to doubt this, amillennial American Calvinists developed an inward-looking ghetto mentality. Premillennial Calvinists also adopted this same ghetto mentality, but they added to this a typically fundamentalist outlook: “We don’t smoke, and we don’t chew, and we don’t date the boys who do!” First, Prohibition- ist replaced evangelism. Then anti-Communism replaced the cul- tural mandate. The result was the Bible Presbyterian Church. The only premillennial Presbyterian alternative offered so far has been a vague evangelicalism, disdainful of God’s cultural mandate: And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, 25.

Conclusion The goal of bringing all civil covenants under the official jurisdic- tion of the God of the Bible is too terri~ing a task for those who think it is inherently impossible. Christians with this attitude want to achieve something far more limited. This is why a few of them have adopted the goal of a Constitutional amendment to have Jesus Christ acknowledged in that systematically apostate document. We do not need a perfunctory admission that such a restructured cove- nant is judicially mandatory but historically impossible. We need a vision of victory to undergird a comprehensive, Bible-based, law- based program of comprehensive reconstruction. Men will not affirm the oath before “they see the benefits (Deut. 4:5-8). They must first learn to trust those who proclaim the judicial necessity of the oath. Thus, to proclaim the formal necessity of the Trinitarian na- tional oath without also working in every area of life to manifest the historic benefits of God’s covenant is an exercise in futility. It will lead to the creation of psychological and eschatological justifications for failure. God does not expect excuses for failure; He expects victory, in time and on earth. We are His representatives (point two of the cove- nant model). Therefore, we are expected to win in history. Let us not downplay God’s expectations or our capacities. We can do all things through Christ who strengthens us: governed by God’s law, empowered by the Holy Spirit, and blessed by God’s external, visi- ble, historic positive sanctions."},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"Christ is King in the most complete Biblical sense of the word ‘king,” which means sovereignty, rulership, and authority, in the highest possible sense of each of these terms (Phil. 2:9-11; Eph. 1:17-23; 1 Tim. 6:15; Heb. 1:8-14; 1 Peter 3 :22; Rev. 1:5). This sovereignty, or kingdom, exists in the sense that all the resources necessary for its wo~ld-wide, victorious manifestation are even now available to be- lieving men and the faithful church (Mat. 28:18-20; Rem. 8:28; Eph. 1:10-11). Christ now occupies the true throne of which the old throne of David was but a visible and temporary symbol (Luke 1:32-33; Acts 2:29-36). The old Israel has been expanded to include all the nations of men (Mat. 8:11; Acts 3:24-26; 5:30-32; I Cor. 12:12-13). The kind of power present in and manifested by the kingdom is seen in its redemptive aspects at Pentecost and in the subsequent conversion of multitudes of Jews and Gentiles to the Christian faith (cf. Acts 1:8). The supplementary aspect of judgment is clearly visi- ble in all human history, and especially in the destruction of .Jeru- salem and the temple, a“nd the final dispersal of national Israel ~ The kingdom is not patterned after the kingdoms of this world (in pomp, pageantry and abundance of material possessions). It is a kingdom of truth, righteousness, peace and joy. Its citizens are recognized by their child-like humility, brotherly love, and self-sacrificing devotion to Christ (Mat. 5:3, 10; 18:1-5; John 18:36-37; Rem. 14:17). The ultimate function of the Kingdom in time is the redemption of a multitude which no man can number out of all nations of earth, and their restoration to the favour and fellowship of God (John 3 :16; 17:20-23; 2 Cor. 5:19-20; Eph. 1:8-14; Revelation 7:9). When the kingdom shall have achieved its destined purpose on earth it will be transferred to the eternal world (1 Cor. 15:24-25).

Thus, we can devise short-term tactics in terms of God’s long-run strategy, a strategy which is covenantal is nature. It is time to adopt a vision of victory regarding the kingdom of God in history. To do less is to betray the God of the covenant. As His sole, lawful, delegated agents in history, Christians must make visible in history the kingdom of God which exists already in eternity and exists judicially. The ascension of Jesus to the right hand of God was the definitive historical manifestation of Christ’s kingdom reign; it is our task to make His reign manifest in history. This is the re- quirement of the Great Commission (Matt. 28:18 -20).2 This spiri- tual and cultural commission must not be evaded or defined out of ex- istence by His people. To do this, we must break from the mental chains of the present humanist order which claims to represent all the people. This is a false claim. It represents only some of the people. It surely does not publicly and self-consciously represent anyone before the judgment throne of God, which is what civil government is supposed to do. Paul called civil magistrates ministers OJ God. “For rulers are not a ter- ror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil” (Rem. 13:3-4). Christians are citizens of at least two nations: an earthly one and a heavenly one. Paul wrote: “For our citizenship is in heaven” (Phil. 3: 20a, New American Standard Bible). Our primary allegiance is to the second nation. It is our task to begin to develop in history the principles of citizenship in the heavenly kingdom. We are to seek to persuade our fellow earthly citizens of the benefits of holding dual citizenship papers. In the United States, birth inside the national boundaries plus eighteen years of life gives one full citizenship.

This new political order can subsequently be maintained — though not without continuing widespread conversions — on a judicially negative basis: by removing legal access to the fran- chise and civil offices from those who refuse to become communicant members of Trinitarian churches. Very few Christians believe that the former strategy is possible, and even fewer of them believe that the latter strategy is moral. Christians therefore continue to live under apostate civil cove- nants. They continue to affirm implicitly and even explicitly that there is one area of life which is immune to the gospel, and required by God to remain immune from the gospel: civil government.

Legal philosophers have always debated, and presumably always will debate, whether law is founded in reason and morality or whether it is only the will of the political ruler. It is not necessary to resolve that debate in order to conclude that as a matter of historical fact the legal systems of all the nations that are heirs to the Western legal tradition have been rooted in certain beliefs or postulates: that is, the legal systems them- selves have presupposed the validity of those beliefs. Today those beliefs or postulates – such as the structural integrity of law, its on- goingness, its religious roots, its transcendent qualities – are rapidly disappearing, not only from the minds of philosophers, not only from the minds of lawmakers, judges, lawyers, law teachers, and other members of the legal profession, but from the consciousness of the vast majority of citizens, the people as a whole; and more than that, the y are disappearing from the law itself. The law is becoming more fragmented, more subjective, geared more to expediency and less to morality, concerned more with immediate consequences and less with consistency or continuity.

You can’t beat something with nothing. We see a conflict going on today in every area of life. It is a war over first principles. It is ultimately a war over the covenant. Whose covenant will individuals affirm, God’s or Satan’s? Being covenantal, this conflict also necessarily involves the allegiance of three corporate covenantal institutions: Church, State, and family. Which covenant will these God-authorized corporate monopolies affirm, God’s or Satan’s? Which covenant will be the source of law for them? The humanist has made his choice against God’s covenant. He has made this choice personally, and he sees to it that all those cove- nantal institutions in which he has authority have also made the same choice. The problem today is that Christians refuse to make this choice. They pretend that such a choice is unnecessary to their salvation, even uncalled for biblically. They refuse to think in terms of the five points of the covenant. They want Jesus as Savior but not as Lord, meaning cozsenantal Lord. 1 They think they can take part of Jesus’ office and leave the rest. They think they are not under the full covenantal obligations of God when they accept Jesus Christ as their savior. They do not really believe that God imposes His covenantal standards on professed Christians to test the validity of their public confession. They say that they believe in the Book of Galatians, the book that frees Christians from the law of God. “Galatians, Gala- tians ,“ they cry, conveniently forgetting Paul’s warning in Galatians: Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatty, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, 1.

And the people answered him not a word” (I Ki. 18:21). They waited then, and they wait today. And wait. They want to see which way the fire falls.

It’s none of the church’s business.” And after twelve or more years of education at taxpayers’ expense, their children then rebel. They leave the faith. They turn to another covenant.

This adjustment was to abandon – at least while working within uni- versity precincts – the tradition of providential historiography stretch- ing to Constantine’s Eusebius.

They would, to a man, rewrite Genesis 25, for they have already done so in their own tenured lives: And Esau sod pottage: and Jacob came from the field, and he was faint: And Jacob said to Esau, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same wheat and barley pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Wheaton. And Esau said, Sell me this day thy birthright. And Jacob said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me? And ‘Esau said, ,Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birth- right unto Esau. Then Esau gave Jacob bread and pottage of Ientiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Jacob despised his birthright (Gen. 25:29-34; King Saul Edition). The pietist declares, “God saves souls, not cultures. God judges souls in eternity, not cultures in history. And even if He may occa- sionally judge a culture, we Christians must attribute this to the forces of history,” i.e., the latest fad theory of historical change that has captured the historical guild. Any theory of historical causation is open for discussion by Christians, except one: God’s providence. Any theory of civil government is open for discussion by Christians, except one: God’s theocracy. These two opinions are linked together, and the common thread is a rejection of Eusebius and Constantine, for Constantine, the head of civil government in Rome, publicly placed an entire civilization under the sanctions of God’s civil cove- nant, as did his successors (except Julian the apostate, a two-year retrogression who failed). This was a bad, bad precedent in the eyes of pietists, whether they are fundamentalist political conservatives or tenured neo-evangelical political liberals. “No creed but the New Testament pastoral epistles and no law but love!” This same discount kingdom syndrome existed in David’s day, too. Its promoters infuriated David. He cried out to God: “I hate the double-minded, but I love your law” (Ps. 119:113, New King James Version)."},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"630 POLITICAL POLYTHEISM Permanent Cease-Fires Are Concealed Surrenders At the time of the American Revolution, there were three million people living in the U. S.; of these, 20,000 were Roman Catholics and about 3,000 were Jews. 5 Who inherited the country? The Unitarians and their spiritual heirs. They used the myth of neutral- ity to capture the national government covenantally — which Rush- doony has always deniedG – and therefore politically, which Rush- doony has always affirmed.7 “So deeply is the myth of neutralism im- bedded~ he writes, “that to deal realistically and honestly with it is tantamount to political suicide. Politicians must assure every last plundering faction of its sanctimonious neutralism while insisting on its own. Each particular faction, of course, insists on its own impar- tial, neutral and objective stance while deploring the partisan and subjective position of its adversaries. All are equally committed to the great modern myth that such neutrality is possible. This myth is basic to classical liberalism and to most schools of thought, conserva- tive and radical, which are derived from it .“ 8 This myth of neutrality steadily leads to the concept of humanist world government; local loyalties are not sufficiently broad; true neutrality can only be achieved through international politics and international moralit y.g The Constitutional capture of America by the Unitarians in 1788 was based on the myth of neutrality. They destroyed the biblical State covenant 10 at the national level, and then quietly, unobtrusively substituted apostate state and local covenants. This was also done in the name of neutrality, as Rushdoony has said so well. In short, new covenant, new god. This new god is revealed by his law-order in Amer- ican society. Rushdoony writes that ‘in any culture the source of the law is the god of that society.” 11 The source of biblical law is the God of the Bible. His moral character is revealed in His laws — all His laws, not just the Ten Commandments. Without biblical law at the center of a 5. R. J.

It testifies falsely regarding God. A society is in rebellion against God to the extent that its people refuse to acknowledge in the civil realm the terms of the civil covenant. There is a specific legal order which God requires in His Word. God is totally sovereign, as manifested by the presence of His required laws and sanctions. A society that denies the continuing judicial validity of Old Testament civil law in general thereby refuses to acknowledge that this world was, is, and ever shall be a theocracy. God rules. How does a nation testify in his- tory to this fact? God’s rules. To the extent that the legal order does not conform to the legal standard that God announces in His Bible, to that extent is a society in rebellion against God. Judicial Evangelism That God requires Trinitarian evangelism to be law-oriented is denied by virtually all Christian denominations and congregations today. They deny that God reveals himself in New Testament times as clearly through His law as He did in the Old Testament. Chris- tians should ask themselves: Why would God choose to reveal him- self less clearly in the New Testament era by allowing every society except Puritan New England to adopt a law-order other than what He revealed in the Old Testament? The theonomists have an answer to this intriguing question. God allows this only to prove a point: the visible failure in history of all law-orders compared to the visible suc- cess of His revealed law-order. This visible failure can then become a tool of evangelism. Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the L ORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to pos- sess it. Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people. For what nation is there so great, who bath God so nigh unto them, as the L ORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for? And what nation is there so great, that bath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day? (Deut. 4:5-8). 12.

It only means that so far in history, He has re- peatedly allowed His people to depart from His law, just as Israel did, only to find themselves as slaves to their God-hating enemies. God does not annul His sanctions in history; He continues to en- force them. The question of questions for Christian applied theology, ethics, and social theory is this one: Why should Christians accept as their long-term earthly goal the establishment of any system of civil law other than the one set forth in the Bible? In other words, why should Christians affirm in principle the acceptability of any law-order other than biblical law? Why should they enthusiastically choose second- best, third-best, or even totalitarian civil order in preference to bibli- cal law? Why is their last choice always biblical law? We could search for answers in psychology, sociology, education, and in any other academic specialties. I prefer to begin looking for the answer in the area of ethics: Christians prefer irresponsibili~. The Suppression of Go&s Eternal Sanctions It is not just biblical law that modern evangelicalism rejects. Where is any clearly stated doctrine of hell and eternal torment in most of today’s evangelism programs? The doctrine of hell has stead- ily disappeared from mass evangelism ever since D. L. Moody an- nounced: “Terror never brought a man in yet .“ 13 Campus Crusade for Christ is today’s model: not a word about eternal punishment in their primary evangelism materials. The question of evangelical questions, “Are you saved?” does not have a forthright, open answer to the obvious response, ‘Saved from what?” 14 The doctrine of covenantal sanctions has been the weakest point of the theology of the Protestant Reformation. Protestantism has never been clear on exactly what the sacraments are: ~“udicial sanc- 13. Cited by Stanley N. Gundry, Loue Them In: Th Proclamation Theology of Dwight L.

Instead, the sacraments are seen as either pure memorials (phi- losophical nominalism) or semi-Catholic (philosophical realism). 15 Step by step, Protestants have retreated from any concept of public sanctions against unbelief, including the outward workings of unbe- lief (e. g., abortion), until today, even the doctrine of hell is called into question. 16 Academic Christian theology today has been stripped of almost all its distinctive in the name of anti-covenantalism. The covenant is a package deal, whether you are for it or against it. When people abandon it, they in principle have abandoned all of it. Over time, this abandonment forces people to restructure their theologies in all five points. Some people catch on earlier than others, but the direc- tion away from the covenant is clear: away from Calvinism. Consis- tent theologians cannot hang onto only part of the biblical covenant. 17 15. As in Lutheranism’s consubstantiation doctrine, where Jesus in His perfect humanity is in some way present in or near the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper. For a philosophical critique, see Cornelius Van Til, A Survey of Christian Epi~temology, VOI, II of In D@se of Biblical Christiani~ (den Dulk Foundation, 1969), ch. 6. 16. A recent example of this 40-year drift away from the Bible took place in May, 1989, at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, near Chicago, Illinois. Trinity, with as- sistance from the National Association of Evangelical, held a conference of 385 theologians, Christian leaders, and laymen: “Evangelical Affirmations/89 .“ The goal of conference organizers Cad F. H. Henry and Kenneth Kantzer was to develop a document defining the word “evangelical.” (Better four decades late than never! ) Henry’s 1947 book, The Troubled Conscience of Fundamentali&n, is accurately described as one of the founding documents of neo-evangelicaf ism. That he later wrote Evan- gelical in Search of Zdenti~ (Word, 1976) is also worth mentioning. They are still searching. The dilemma of neo-evangelicalism today is acute; its advocates do not know what they believe in, except for their single creedal formulation: “Fundamen- talism is too restricting on our career goals.” At the Trinity conference, a debate broke out over the doctrine of “annihila- tionism,” also known as “conditionalism,” a doctrine held by Seventh-Day Adven- tists, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Christadelphians, etc. It teaches that there is only an- nihilation for unregenerate sinners in eternity — no hell or lake of fire. Theologian J. I. Packer adamantly pressed the assembly to adopt a statement affirming the tra- ditional creedal position of eternal punishment, but to no avail. The vote was split, but the chairman d~clared that those refusing to include a positive statement on such a negative idea had been in the majority. Neo-evangelicalism, like the cults, is now prepared to shrug its collective shoulders to the question of God’s sanctions with a noncommittal “What the hell?” Lacking fire in its eschatology, it lacks fire in its belly. Short on ortho in its doxy, neo-evangelicalism is increasingly bent out of shape. For an account of this conference, see World (June 3, 1989), p. 9. 17. A good example of this reactionary shift is the magazine that in the 1970’s was called Present Troth. It was officially Calvinistic. In reaction against Christian Recon- struction, its editor in the early 1980’s switched his theology to Barthianism and out- right theological liberalism. It is now called Virdtct.

The history of Connecticut from its founder Thomas Hooker in 1639 to Connecticut scion George Bush (a Yale grad) 19 today, or the history of Yale College from 1740 20 to today, can also be viewed in the same way. The his- tory of America has paralleled the development of Massachusetts and Connecticut. That Dukakis ran against Bush for President in 1988 is representative of the influence of anti-covenantalism in American history. Harvard and Yale still dominate the American Establishment; only their theologies have changed. A Preference for Irresponsibility In the Northern Kingdom from the days of Jeroboam’s revolt, there were only two publicly acceptable operating religious systems: tbe worship of Jehovah by means of Baalist icons and practices (the golden calves: I Ki. 12:28) and the worship of Baal by means of Baalist icons and practices (1 Ki. 18). Elijah challenged representatives of the people of Israel to choose between Baal and Jehovah, but they an- swered not a word (I Ki. 18:21). Even when they at last declared them- selves in favor of God (I Ki. 18:39), it was only as a result of God’s dis- play of greater supernatural and visible power, and their commitment did not last longer than Elijah’s ability to repeat such displays on a regular, invariable basis. In their deepest apostasy, they became dis- ciples of the power religion. They returned spiritually to Egypt. the life of antinomian Jon Zens, who used to publish a Calvinist magazine, Ba@d Reformation Review, who is now a self-conscious Anabaptist as a result of his reaction to Christian Reconstruction. He changed the name of his magazine to Searching Together. Roger Williams’ legacy lives on. Both editors finally recognized that Calvin- ism is covenantal, and the biblical covenant is a unitary system. They then aban- doned Calvinism. This connection between Calvinism and the biblical covenant may also eventually occur to seminary professors at Calvinist institutions, though not in the near future, I suspect. 18.

Judah had the Temple. It had ritually acceptable religion. It never adopted pure Baalism. God therefore delivered Israel into captivity to the Assyrians more than a century before He delivered Judah (and Assyria) to the Babylonians. Even so, He had waited several centuries before He abandoned Israel to Assyria. The Northern Kingdom’s religious practices had been corrupt from the very beginning, but there are degrees of corruption. For a time, God graciously delays bringing His negative sanctions in history. It is not that He honors corruption; instead, He honors the absence of full corruption. But corruption, like “incorruption,” does not remain idle. Corruption grows or contracts. Both corruption and righteous- ness are kingdom principles. It depends upon which kingdom we are discussing: God’s or Satan’s. Each kingdom seeks extension geo- graphically, temporally, institutionally, and psychologically. Each serves as leaven. 21 Each recognizes that in principle, there can be no neutrality. Each therefore recognizes that as time goes on, there will be less and less cooperation possible between covenant-keepers and covenant-breakers. There can be no combination of leavened and unleavened bread. The same is true of society.

The word of His resurrection spread among the called-out ekklesia. Then the war between the kingdoms began in earnest — earnest in the sense of serious, and also earnest in the sense of God’s down payment in history of a future fulfillment. When Christians at last begin to see the comprehensive implications of the resurrection, the war will escalate. (This escalation has been going on since the resurrection, but it has been a process marked by many historical discontinuities.) Once a-new phase of the war begins, both sides become increas- ingly consistent. The cultural advantage swings to the covenant- keepers whenever th~ honor the external laws of God’s covenant. Their obe- dience brings visible, external blessings (Deut. 28:1-14), while the re- bellious receive visible blessings more and more in terms of their public honoring of the kingdom principles announced by the cove- nant-keepers. If they refuse to adapt, they grow weak and eventually disappear in history. 23 Those who survive become increasingly de- pendent on the good behavior and good works of covenant-keepers. This dependence tends to persuade them to reduce their persecution of covenant-keepers. They hire them because covenant-keepers — when the latter are adhering to the external laws of God’s covenant — are hon- est, effective workers. They buy from them for the same reason. Ser- vice leads to dominion. The law of God is the primary tool of dominion that God offers to all men, irrespective of their personal faith. He gives the Holy Spirit to His people, but if His people refuse for a season to honor the terms of the covenant, while God-rejecting men willingly adopt the external terms of the covenant, then the latter will prosper externally. The best example of this process in recent history is the reversal of economic power between Japan and the United States, 1945-1988. The Japanese, not being Protestants, nevertheless adopted the Prot- estant ethic of their American conquerors. The Americans, having become the richest people on earth by their adherence to this ethic, steadily abandoned it in the post-War era. They concluded incor- rectly that the might of their hands had gotten them this wealth 23. My favorite example is the disintegration of the culture of the Ik, a thor- oughly perverse Kenyan tribal people. See Colin Turnbull, The Mountain Peopk (New York: Touchstone, 1972).

Worse; they concluded that public education had got- ten them this wealth. They began to worship at the temple of the State. They began to put more faith in formal tests than in actual on- the-job productivity. In this sense, Confucianism progressively con- quered America, and one of the worst aspects of Confucianism: the worship of bureaucratic status based on examinations. z~ Long-term, it requires that God grant special grace (regenera- tion) to large numbers of people in order for a society to adhere to the external terms of the covenant. 25 But in the short run, which can last several generations, the appropriate visible blessings of the cove- nant can go to those who are committed only externally to particular terms of the covenant. Japan, for example, was the first nation to adopt abortion as a national policy. Why should the Japanese be uniquely blessed? It is a case of comparative obedience: the Soviet Union and the Chinese also began to promote abortions as national policy; the United States accepts its legality, and its intellectual lead- ers are overwhelmingly pro-abortion. So, God looks at other aspects of the covenant, those related to the economics of dominion: hon- esty, hard work, precise work, rigorous education, thrift, future- orientation, etc. In these areas, the Japanese excel. They therefore receive the lion’s share of the external blessings. If they refuse to con- vert to faith in Jesus Christ, however, they will find it impossible to adhere as a nation to the external terms of the covenant. The rising sun will set. The Supposed Perversi~ of HistoV The modern Church has abandoned faith in the covenantal cause- and-effect relationship between national external conformity to God’s law and His external blessings. The Church therefore does not believe in God’s sanctions in history. In Old Testament times, yes, but not in New Testament times. The Church believes that God gave a clearer revelation of His ethical standards before Christ came to redeem the world. They believe with Van Til that God’s visible sanctions in history were a mark of His condescension to His people in an earlier era. 26 In short, they conclude that Christians do not 24.

Covenant-breakers rejoice at this thought, for such a removal of God’s sanctions in history leaves Satan’s sanctions intact: cursing for the righteous and blessing for the unrighteous. This is what Van Til taught, and it is what all non-theonomic pessimillen- nialists implicitly believe. Van Til always insisted that there can be no neutrality. He meant intellectual neutrality and ethical neutrality. But because he did not affirm all five points of the biblical covenant, he separated ethics from historical sanctions. Thus, as far as history is concerned, he did affirm neutrality. And yet he didn’t. Van Til really affirmed satanic sanctions. He implicitly recognized (but never explicitly) that if God does not impose His sanctions, then Satan will impose his. Meredith Kline’s view of historical sanctions affirms neutrality – random sanc- tions, humanly speaking— but Van Til, as a consistent amillennial- ist, affirmed reverse sanctions: the bad get richer and the good get poorer. Christ’s second coming is a total reversal of this world of per- verse sanctions. Thus, neither the covenant-keeper nor the covenant- breaker has an “earnest” of the final judgment to come. Neither is given a warning in history of the eternal consequences of his re- spective covenant. History for the amillennialist is not a tale told by an idiot, signifying nothing; it is a tale told by a deceiver, concealing everything. Rarely do modern Christians take seriously the idea of “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” For example, fully consistent dispensationalists refuse to pray Jesus’ “Jewish kingdom” prayer in this, the “Church Age.” As far as the dis- pensationalist is concerned, the “Church Age” manifests all the char- acteristics of amillennialism’s psychologically internal and shrinking ecclesiastical kingdom: the progressive defeat and isolation of Chris- tians and Christianity.

Christians have assumed that Jesus’ ministry, or at least Paul’s, did away entirely with the case laws. Nevertheless, when pressed to defend some traditional practice of any particular denomination, the group’s in-house theologians turn to the Old Testament in search of a legal precedent. This is an aspect of what Rushdoony has called smorgasbord religion: selectively picking what you like out of a large selection of rules and doctrines. The best example of such New Testament selective shopping is the strict sabbatarian’s appeal to all but one verse in the Old Testament requiring God’s people to keep holy the sabbath. The exception is Exodus 35:2, the verse to which the capital sanction is attached: “Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the L ORD : whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.” When it comes to the imposition of this most rigorous of Old Testament civil sanctions, capital punishment, the Church flees in holy terror. “Keep the sabbath holy, but not that holy!” A required sanction clearly identifies God’s attitude toward a particular infraction. The sanction tells us just how important the infraction is in the overall operation of the kingdom of God. Without sanctions, there can be no civil law, and without civil law there can be no civilization, meaning no identifiable kingdom. But there is always some form of civilization. There are no historical vacuums. There are therefore no political or judicial vacuums. Thus, we ought to conclude that God has required His people to declare His re- quired civil sanctions, while self-proclaimed autonomous man has a different set of civil laws and sanctions. God has revealed His re- quired sanctions in His Bible-revealed law; self-proclaimed autono- mous man has revealed his required sanctions in his voluminous legislation. For as long as there are infractions of a judicial standard, there will be sanctions. The question is: Whose? Whose standards and whose sanctions? 27.

It has wanted to find some agreeable halfway po- sition. Christian scholars have endlessly asserted the existence of neutral, “natural” laws that can serve as the Church’s earthly hope of the ages, an agreeable middle way that will mitigate the conflict in history between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of man. The winner of such a naive quest will always be the kingdom of man. Theoretical neutrali~ means man’s operational autonomy: men do not have to consider what God requires or threatens in history. God brings His sanctions in history, positive and negative. He can do this through His people, who act representatively as His agents, or He can do it through pagan armies or seemingly imper- sonal environmental forces. He can choose war, pestilence, or fam- ine. He can even choose “all of the above.” But He does brings His sanctions in history. There is no escape from these historical sanc- tions, any more than there is an escape from His eternal sanctions. The former point to the latter. History has coherence and meaning on~ because of these sanctions and the decrees of God. God’s historical sanctions serve as evidence of His theocratic sov- ereignty over the creation. This is why Christians who rebel at the idea of theocracy also must rebel against the idea of God’s temporal sanctions. The idea of the national covenant repels them, for such a covenant testifies to the existence of a Christian civil hierarchy, Christian civil laws, Christian civil sanctions, and Christian civil conquest in history by means of God’s sanctions of blessings and cursings. Thus we find a trio of Christian historians, safe and tenured in their humanist-accredited colleges and universities, who insist on placing the word Christian in italics when they speak of America’s “Christian” origins or “Christian” cultures in general.

Only one idea is more repugnant to modern Christian intellec- tuals than the idea of judicially binding biblical civil blueprints. 29 That idea is the doctrine of each person’s predestined eternity. The two ideas are linked judicially: san.ctiom. Men do not like to be reminded by Paul that “the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. Therefore bath he mercy on whom he bath mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth” (Rem. 9:17-18). If God did this with Pharaoh, He can do it to anyone. This means sanctions. The mild and gentle negative civil sanctions of the Old Testa- ment — whipping, restitution, slavery, banishment, and public exe- cution — are light taps on the wrist compared to eternal screaming agony in the lake of fire. Covenant-breaking men easily understand this distinction in intensity. They know what is coming in eternity. They resent it. Thus, in order to banish from their consciousness the thought of eternal torture at the hand of an outraged, implacable God, they feel compelled to banish also the idea that God has estab- lished civil covenants in history which authorize and require His lawful representatives to apply the Old Testament’s minimal negative sanctions. Instead, they have implicitly adopted two other doctrines, the doctrine of autonomous man and the concomitant doctrine, the autonomous State. The State becomes the sole agency authorized by autonomous man to impose compulsory sanctions. (The only alternative to this view is the doctrine of zero civil government, meaning zero compul- 29.

He prefers to be- lieve that the State’s sanctions are final. The State’s sanctions must be seen as alternatives to God’s final judgment, not evidence for it. He must assert this if God’s final sanctions are to be denied effec- tively. In order to make such an assumption believable, the State must be given power to impose sanctions far worse than those au- thorized by the Old Testament. Leaky Christians It is my view that there are three subordinate tests for orthodoxy, once a person has affirmed the obvious: the virgin birth of Jesus, the Trinity, and the bodily resurrection of Christ. These three tests are: affirming the six-day creation, affirming the worldwide Noachic flood, and affirming the doctrine of hell (lake of fire). There are other tests, but anyone who waffles on one of these should be examined far more carefully; he leaks. He is going to leak a lot more. A Christian who is unwilling to affirm publicly the inescapability of God’s eternal negative covenant sanctions is also unlikely to be willing to insist on the temporal, negative, and covenantal sanctions, for such temporal sanctions are an earnest — down payment — on His final sanctions. Such sanctions-denying Christians eventually find themselves under the civil (and also intellectual) authority of covenant-breakers who also deny the continuing validity of biblical law, meaning Old Testament sanctions. Those who assert their defiance of covenant law the most insistently are covenant-breakers who affirm the auton- omy of man, or who at least deny the existence of the God of the Bible. Thus, in their quest to avoid thinking about God’s eternal tor- ture chamber beyond the grave, Christians have willingly submitted in principle to temporal rule by those covenant-breakers who deny the lake of fire with the greatest self-confidence. You cannot beat some- thing with something less. On the other hand, those Christians who in history were most willing to affirm God’s predestinated, inescapable, eternal sanctions were also the only ones ready to insist on the covenantal necessity of legislating the most feared of God’s negative sanctions, public execu- 30.

The Puritans under- stood that civil liberty begins with the civil government’s enforce- ment of God’s required sanctions. Their successors have not under- stood this, and they have deeply resented the Puritans’ public testi- mony in this regard. Kingdom and Education The Constitution made religious test oaths illegal. It also made it illegal for Congress to make any laws regarding religion, though of course it could not and did not prohibit religious laws, since all law is religious. This precedent obviously made it illegal to establish any church by law at the federal level. But until the Fourteenth Amendment be- came the law of the land, this restriction on Congress did not apply to the states. Steadily, however, the states abandoned the support of churches with tax money. Connecticut ended the practice in 1813; Massachusetts ceased in 1833. 31 This disestablished the Trinitarian churches; it did not disestab- lish Unitarianism. The Unitarians were wise men; they knew that they were strangers in a generally Christian culture. They realized that they had to disguise their program to establish their religion. They knew that they could not, and should not, receive tax money for their little group of churches in Boston. That would have given the game away. Instead, their agent, Horace Mann, devised and then successfully sold the idea of religiously neutral but universally moral education to the taxpayers of Massachusetts. He did this by adopting the same doctrine of religious neutrality and common-ground knowledge that had worked so well from 1687 (Newton’s Princ@ia) to 1787 (the Constitution). With this, Mann created a new concept of public education. This was the great flim-flam, the establishment of a new national denomination and a new national priesthood. It took well over a century for any Christian scholar to sound the alarm on both evils: taxpayer-financed education and religiously neutral education. There had been many opponents of Mann, but 31.

Rushdoony first sounded the alarm among Christian scholars: that 1) all state-supported, taxpayer-financed education is inherently immoral and anti-Christian, since it removes the author- ity over education from parents, and 2) the Unitarians had invented the public school system to further their own messianic and salva- tional agenda. 32 Sidney Mead also admitted it in 1963: “. . . the public-school system of the United States is its established church.”3 3 Mann built his case on the doctrine of natural law, natural rights, and Providence, and he stated this forthrightly, in the lan- guage of George Washington and the Framers, whose theology he shared. “I believe in the existence of a great, immortal, immutable principle of natural law, or natural ethics – a principle antecedent to all human institutions, and incapable of being abrogated by any or- dinance of man, – a principle of divine origin, clearly legible in the ways of Providence as those ways are clearly manifested in the order of Nature and in the history of the race, which proves the absolute rzght to an education of every human being that comes into the world; and which, of course, proves the correlative duty of every government to see that the means of education are provided for all.”w Mann’s program of education was a consistent development of Madison’s system of fictionalizing Christianity. The goal is to remove faction — meaning sectarz”ani.wn — from every public institution and from all public policy. Mann’s program relied on the Madiso- nian removal of Trinitarian oaths and creeds from public institu- tions, a policy that had been copied by Massachusetts law in 1833. His strategy involved the substitution of creedless morality for Trini- tarian morality. It therefore involved the substitution of common- ground religion for Trinitarian religion. His was the morality of the procedurally empty but substantively Unitarian, fully Constitu- tional, Madisonian pantheon. He articulated this Madisonian strat- egy in 1848, at the end of his career. I believed then (1837), as now, that sectarian books and sectarian in- struction, if their encroachment were not resisted, would prove the over- throw of the schools. 32. R. J.

The New England Puritans viewed the State as an agency of positive good, as did all Christians in 1638, and to that extent they adopted to some degree the Greco-Roman view of the messianic State. This misuse of Mas- sachusetts public funds was stopped in 1833. The Puritans also used local tax money to support local schools. This practice began in 1642 and was reinforced by a new law in 1647.37 In the state constitutions of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Maryland of the 1780’s, the public support of school teachers was reaffirmed. w Not only was this legacy of New England Puritanism not abandoned in the 1830’s, it accelerated, cul- minating in the post-World War I modern public school system. Those Christians who adamantly oppose taxpayer-financed edu- cation because of its humanism understand that the myth of educa- tional neutrality is indeed a myth. Nevertheless, the theological roots of the public education system are the same as the theological roots of the U.S. Constitution: the doctrine of moral neutrality in civil government.

That Christian opponents of the public school system support without hesitation the Constitutional provision of prohibiting religious test oaths is surprising. Madison’s theory of the neutral State undergirds both institutions. Public money goes to both systems in the name of civic religious neutrality and common-ground morality. Education is the working out of a religious worldview. It cannot be neutral. It will reflect either the kingdom of God or the kingdom of man. It is the outworking of kingdom principles. But we should not make the mistake of thinking that education is itself a separate covenantal calling. It is not on the same level that the Church, State, and family are. It is not marked by a self-valedictory oath. It is analo- gous to a Christian business, not a church. We mwt be uey wa~ OJ in- vesting education with smrarrwntal or covenantal language.

It means either the lawful or unlawful exercise of authority in history. In short, kingdom means sanctions. God’s kingdom can operate with minimal civil sanctions in history, meaning aminimal State, only because it is authorized by God and accepted covenantally by people who believe in God’s horrifying negative sanctions beyond the grave.

This is why he could argue years later that Christian education, as an extension of the family, is sometimes deserving of the tithe rather than the Church. Rushdoony, Tithing and Dominion (Vallecito, California: Ross House, 1979), p. 9. Rushdoony has long ignored what should be obvious: sacramentalism is an inesca- pable concept; some institution must be “sacramentalized.” Some institution has to administer the sacraments. Man must meet his sovereign master to renew the cove- nant on a regular basis. Rushdoony denies that either the Church or the State should be sacramentalized: Law and Socie~ (Vallecito, California: Ross House, 1982), p. 128. Then, three pages later, he writes: “The family, as we have seen, is the most powerful institution in society, controlling as it does, in terms of Biblical law, the three key areas of society, children, property, and inheritance” (p. 131).

What the case laws provide is an alternative to the messianic State. The case laws provide sanctions that match the magnitude of the crime. The basic penalty for crimes against property aid body is some form of restitution. Capital crimes are crimes against the in- tegrit y of God: those convicted of such infractions are delivered into God’s court for His direct judgment. As history moves closer to the day of final judgment, covenantal postmillennialism teaches, society will progressively be conformed to these standards. Democratically, meaning a bottom-up mouement initiated by the Ho~ Spirit, voters will progressively enact the whole law-order of God. This will probably take several centuries. Christian maturity is costly and time-consuming. Thus, what the Puritans attempted to do in England, 1640-60, was morally wrong and strategically self-destructive because it was a top- down imposition of God’s law. What the New England Puritans at- tempted to do was valid; there was general agreement about biblical civil law when the society was founded in the wilderness. But immi- gration and defections, coupled with the restoration of King Charles II in 1660, changed the religious environment in New England. The era of the halfway covenant began .40 The Spirit and Democracy Democracy literally means “people’s rule.” The sovereignty of the people is the basis of the modern democratic order. In ancient Greece, democracy was a product of family gods; male representa- tives of household gods spoke in clan councils; and as the city-state developed, they spoke in the councils of the poli.s. The idea is that man speaks in the name of a ruling deity; in modern times, the rul- ing deity is the people as a whole, who of course remain politely silent. A distinction is made between the will of the silent, repre- sented people and the present decision of the representatives. The people can retroactively bring sanctions against the representatives, either at elections or in revolution. Thus, those speaking for the peo- ple at any time cannot be said to represent the people perfectly at any given time, since it is not clear precisely who the people are, and how (or if) they differ from their present representatives.

Democracy is a form of government, and in all governments acts of State are determined by an exertion of will. But in what sense can a multitude ex- ercise volition? The student of politics can put to himself no more pertinent question than this. No doubt the vulgar opinion is, that the multitude makes up its mind as the individual makes up his mind. A host of popular phrases testify to this belief. The “will of the People: “public opinion: the “sovereign pleasure of the nation,” Vox Populi, Vox Dei,” belong to this class, which indeed constitutes a great part of the common stock of the plat- form and the press. But what do such expressions mean? They must mean that a great number of people, on a great number of questions, can come to an identical conclusion, and found an identical determination upon it. But this is manifestly true only of the simplest questions .41 Vox Populi may be Vox Dei, but very little attention shows that there never has been any agreement as to what Vox means or as to what Populus means. . . . In reality, the devotee of Democracy is much in the same position as the Greeks with their oracles. All agreed that the voice of an oracle was the voice of a god; but everybody allowed that when he spoke he was not as in- telligible as might be desired, and nobody was quite sure whether it was safer to go to Delphi or Donona. 42 The discrepancy between the hypothetical sovereign People and the representatives of the People is why we have constitutions: to hold in check those who claim to speak for people who have not yet had time to bring sanctions or the threat of sanctions against their spokesmen. Of course, even this is too limited; constitutions exist in order to place restrictions on a temporary majority, even a huge ma- jority, at any point in time. As Nisbet says, “Of all the heresies afloat in modern democracy, none is greater, more steeped in intellectual confusion, and potentially more destructive of proper governmental function than that which declares the legitimacy of government to be directly proportional to its roots in public opinion – or, more ac- curately, in what the daily polls and surveys assure us is public opin- ion. It is this heresy that accounts for the constantly augmenting propaganda that issues forth from all government agencies today – the inevitable effort to shape the very opinion that is being so assiduously courted — and for the frequent craven abdication of the 41.

The voice of political representatives is supposed to be mediatory judicially. Judges are to declare God’s law and apply it to specific circum- stances. There is supposed to be a progressive maturation of men’s ability to make formal judgments in terms of God’s law as time goes on. Representatives are supposed to think analogously to God. God is not a silent God; He has spoken in His Word. His representatives are supposed to teach His Word to the people, so that they can exer- cise self-government under God. And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles, When all Israel is come to appear before the L ORD thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shah read this law before all Israel in their hearing. Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the L ORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law: And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the L ORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it (Deut. 31:10-13). What the critics of theocracy always assume is that the imposi- tion of God’s law in civil government has to be anti-democratic, i.e., opposed to the principle of political representation. It assumes that civil rulers impose God’s law on recalcitrant citizens, who are some- how deprived of their right or actual ability to bring negative politi- cal sanctions against their rulers. But if the Spirit of God moves a vast majority of men to confess Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, and if they return to the Old Testament in search of biblical blueprints, then the resulting theocratic republic will be legitimate in terms of democratic theory. That this idea is antithetical to the eschatological visions and schemes of humanists, amillennialists, and premillen- nialist does not refute the theory. Nevertheless, humanists, amillen- nialists, and premillennialists continue publicly to misinterpret the position of Christian Reconstruction because these critics are intel- lectually incapable of equating theocracy with democracy.

When that theocratic consensus appears, you can bet your life (perhaps literally) that the humanists will then try to subvert it by an elitist conspiracy.

It was done in the name of the People: “And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the con- gregation are holy, every one of them, and the L ORD is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the L ORD ?” (v. 3). We read about the final such attempt in Revelation , 20:8-9, at the very end of history. These voices of the People are in favor of democracy for only so long as they can control a majority of voters by means of a hierarchical elite that pretends to listen to the People – an elite far more subtle than the Communists’ one-party dictatorship in the name of the people. A sovereign agent always acts through spokesmen in a hierarchy. There will always be an elite: intellectual, educational, military, and so forth. The question is never elite or no elite. It is always a ques- tion of which elite. It is a question of the judicial terms of authority, internal and civil, governing the elite. It is therefore a question of which souereign agent authorizes the elite. The Bible is clear: God is com- pletely, absolutely sovereign over the creation, and men are subordi- nately, inescapably responsible for their actions. Thus, the goal of covenant-keepers is to work toward a social order in which every in- stitution reflects this dual sovereign y, absolute and delegated. It is the creation of an entire world order that prays, ‘Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven” (Matt. 6:10). As a subset of this broad social goal is politics. Politically, the only legitimate long-term biblical goal is the creation of a worldwide theocratic republic. * It is the creation of a bottom-up political order whose civil courts enforce the law of God, and whose people rejoice, not because such a law-order is natural but because it is supernatural.

They argue that political and religious pluralism are morally binding forever, and not just legally binding today. To which I respond: Who says so? Certainly not the philosophy of political pluralism itself. Political pluralism, unique among all political philosophies, allows for its own institutional suicide. It allows people to repeal judicial pluralism. And in fact, this is pre- cisely what is being done today by humanists in the United States, led by the “neutral” U.S. Supreme Court. They are destroying Christian judicial standards. The myth of pluralism is now being ex- posed for what it has always been: a philosophical covering for soci- ety during temporary periods when no one political group can gain the allegiance, or at least the compliance, of the voters. The judicial mark of political pluralism is the right to amend the theological character of the national judicial contract. This is what the humanists did nationally in 1787-88. This is what they have been doing to state covenants in the United States since at least the time of the Civil War. They used to be subtle about this; confident of their power today, they no longer are subtle in’ the least. Nevertheless, it has only be”gun to occur t~ a minority of Christian activists that the national judicial system is systematically stacked against them. What they need to understand is this: it always has been. From 1789 to the present, the American political system has been stacked against Christianity, for it rests on a pair of myths: the myth of political plu- ralism and the myth of neutral natural law. Fortunately, the American political system can be changed peacefully, through the amending process. Political pluralism can be reversed through amendment when self-conscious Christians have the experience, the worldview, and the votes. If this takes two or three centuries to accomplish, fine. Christians have time; humanists don’t. If the great reversal takes place in the aftermath of a collapsed humanist culture, equally fine. Humanism does not work. It will fail.

Like a vampire bat that is sucking the life out of a sleeping animal whose nerve endings have been locally anesthetized by the bat, so is the Christian American voter today. Worse; he has persuaded himself that he is receiving a blood transfusion from the bat. The theology of political plufalism is the chosen local anesthetic of the humanists who seek to destroy Christianity. Christian apologists for political pluralism are their enthusiastic assistants who help administer the anesthetic. A Loss of National Identification Harold O. J. Brown writes: “The United States of America is a generic name and strangely non-revealing. America basically does not know what it is. The United States is not a nation in the tradi- tional sense, because it lacks a common ethnic heritage and spiritual tradition. A viable alternative to nationhood is an empire, but to constitute an empire a society must have a sense of mission that transcends differences of race, language, and culture. The United States currently seems to be a kind of political ‘limited liability hold- ing company,’ and this is not enough to sustain its existence.”50 Professor Brown has raised a fundamental problem in American life. It is my contention that this problem is the result of decisions made in 1787-88. This lack of American identity was not always the case. The colonies possessed a common religious heritage when the Revolution broke out in 1775-76: Calvinism mixed with varying degrees of natural-law philosophy. But the ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1787-88 created a new nation based on a new cove- nant. At that point, the nation broke with its previously Christian 50. Harold O. J.

There would be no other God tolerated in the new political order. There would be no appeal beyond this sovereign god. This collective god, speaking through the federal government, began its inevitable expansion, predicted by the Antifederalists, most notably Patrick Henry. The secularization of the republic began in earnest. This process has not yet ceased. Brown is correct: “The most revolutionary aspect of the founding of the United States was neither independence nor democracy, but the new government’s official neutrality on religion, which has gradually turned into a mild to severe antagonism toward religion. Lamentably, this antagonism is now helping to undermine all the foundations of a humane America.”51 Nevertheless, this surrender to secular humanism was not an overnight process. The rise of Unitarian abolitionism, 52 the coming of the Civil War, the advent of Darwinism, the expansion of immigra- tion, the spread of the public school system, the rise of state licensing and the concomitant growth of universit y certification, and a host of other social and political influences have all worked to transform the interdenominational American civil religion into a religion not fun- damentally different from the one that Jeroboam set up, so that the people of the Northern Kingdom might not journey to Jerusalem in Judah to offer sacrifices (I Ki. 12:26-31). The golden calves may not be on the hilltops, but the theology is the same: religion exists to serve the needs of the State, and the State is sovereign over the mater- ial things of this world. There are many forms of idol worship. The worship of the U.S. Constitution has been a popular form of this an- cient practice, especially in conservative Christian circles. It is not seen as a flawed tool in need of revision but as a holy witness to the truth of the moral validity of permanent political pluralism. Pre-Constitutional Covenants The covenantal sanctions of the pre-Constitutional colonial cove- nants are still in force. Those oaths were taken in good faith before a God who does not forget.

The People are under God as legally protected vassals. If this is not acknowledged covenantally and formally, then the common people will find eventually themselves under tyrants as legally unprotected vassals, Thus, I cannot agree with the statement of Kevin Clauson, pres- ented at the end of an otherwise “insightful essay: “. . . there is noth- ing in the original U.S. Constitution (when not misinterpreted by modern noninterpretivists), the Bill of Rights, and the Constitution’s subsequent amendments that is antithetical to the principle or outworking of theonomy.”5q 1 can think of three features of the Con- stitution which, in and of themselves, broke the Christian civil oaths of the pre-Constitution states: “We the People,” Article VI, Clause 3, and the Fourteenth Amendment: citizenship by physical birth alone. These three are sufficient to destroy the long-run possibility of estab- lishing theonomy as the law of the land. All three are based on the idea of the legitimacy of general revelation as sufficient for estab- lishing a civil covenant before God. H. B. Barrington’s observation is correct: ‘Throughout the history of ethics whenever general revel- ation has been the starting point, the resulting ethical systems have not been reconcilable with biblical principles .“54 The history of once- Christian America stands as a grim piece of evidence for his conclu- sion. It is time to reverse this covenantal drift before the evidence be- comes even more grim. The establishment of a Christian amendment is merely a first step. To proclaim the Trinitarian God of the Bible as the Sovereign Lord of the nation will not solve the problem of civil righteousness. There is no covenant without hierarchy (representation), law, sanc- tions, and a system of transfer for civil office-holders. A statement of Christ’s judicial sovereignty at best provides a biblical answer to only one of the five covenantal requirements. This is not enough to placate the God of the Bible. We dare not forget the warning of Isaiah: Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the L ORD of hosts, and de- spised the word of the Holy One of Israel (Isa. 5:24). 53.

This view is widely shared by almost all Christians today. Christian Reconstructionists would initially appear to be among those who reject such a view of civil government. Not necessarily so. Rushdoony’s view of the Constitution indicates that he holds a very similar view. He accepts and passionately defends the legitimacy of the idea that a Christian national government should not be allowed to mention the God of the Bible in its Constitution. (See Appendix B.) Other Christian defenders of the Constitution argue similarly: the very presence of a Trinitarian clause in the Constitution would be innately anti-Christian. So completely did the Masonic worldview triumph in 1787-89 that the victims of that revolution still regard it as a great leap forward. This is why it was a successful revolution. Should the Constitution be amended to make this nation formally Christian? Let us return to my proposed scenario in Chapter 5: the conversion of a large majority of voters to Christianity. The three pluralist Christian scholars who wrote The Search for Chri~tian America may believe that such a widespread conversion to Christ will never happen in history. No doubt they do believe this. Most Christians do. They are not postmillennialist. But if they take this approach in denying the titure political legitimacy of my scenario, thty have switched the debate from politics to eschatoio~. In doing so, they have denied the fundamental principle of political pluralism: the legal right to change the system to non-pluralism. The pluralist is stuck, in fact and in principle. What he affirms as a mandatory procedural requirement — the open-ended nature of de- mocracy — can baclcfn-e on his substantive goal: the maintenance of a permanent halfway covenant political order.

In fact, the pluralist cannot successfully de- fend the legitimacy of the pluralist order once the anti-pluralists have persuaded the voters of the impossibility of maintaining a halfway covenant political order. And pluralism, because it encourages open debate and lots of “dialoguing,” opens the political door to its deadly enemies. Pluralists have in principle left wide open the political door to fhture Constitutional amendments, as they must do if they are to remain true to their pluralist principles. Those of us who are theo- nomic postmillennialist can then respond: We will live peacefully with this open-door policy for the present, but we do not intend to live with it forever. Someday, we or our spiritual heirs will close that door. We will vote it shut by popular acclamation.” In short, we covenanted Christians can presently rejoice: O @u- ralism, where is thy long-run sting? Christian pluralists are hypnotized by their apostate enemies be- cause their enemies have learned to play the game by mouthing plu- ralist rhetoric even while they are substituting political oligarchy and bureaucracy for pluralism. The theonomists refuse to play this rhe- torical game — or in cases where they do play it, they play it abominably — so they draw the wrath of the pluralists. “How dare you people break with our rhetoric? Better to suffer tyranny at the hands of bureaucratic humanists who say what we like to hear while they are sending us into the cultural gulag rather than live under the ideology of theocracy!” And so, as always, substance progressively triumphs over procedure in the name of procedure. The pluralists never know what is happening to them. Even when they do, they prefer it to living under God’s civil law. “And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: And they said unto them, The L ORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us” (Ex. 5:20-21). I realize that very few Christians believe this today. I am writing for the handful who do. I am not writing a manifesto to be used in today’s elections. I am writing a manifesto for the more distant future. I realize that a Christian politician or activist who is living on this side of the looming crises, and on this side of the great work of the Holy Spirit, will probably prefer to disassociate himself from these sentiments. I was in a meeting of Christian political activists in the fall of 1987.

One astute charismatic participant objected to this objection, how- ever, a former state-wide political organizer. He said this: “The defi- nition of what Christian Reconstruction is should be offered by those who developed the position. We ought to do our best not to be brought under the definition. We want to be able to distinguish our work from theirs. Each of us needs to be able to say to the public, ‘No, I am not a Christian Reconstructionist.’” He was a wise short- term Arminian political strategist.

The war against Christianity that began behind closed doors in Philadelphia in 1787 (or at Mount Vernon in 1785) is now beginning to become visible to formerly naive Christians. They can no longer count on being able to use the Constitution to defend their hoped-for autonomy from the now-humanistic State, for the humanistic State wants autonomy from the covenants of God. It cannot achieve this if Christians are pursuing inherently Christian political or judicial objectives. There is now only one way for Christians to get back inside that officially naked public square: theocraticdy. There is no naked public square. Natural law philosophy died as an intellectual force at least by 1900. Its bastard heir, political pluralism, is now dying. It will soon be dead. Thus, the Christians’ task is to begin to recapture the public square for God. Christians must declare the crown rights of King Jesus in every nook and cranny of the land, including politics.

They believe that if someone has fled from another place of residence, the refugee should not expect to tell his hosts how to run their country. It takes generations to learn the ways of a foreign nation, unless the immigrant has already accepted the reli- gious views thut undergird that nation. If he accepts the religion of the host nation, then he has made the transition. He is ready for citizen- ship. If he is willing to come under the sanction of the sacraments, then he is ready to exercise civil judgment in terms of the law of the covenant. Because modern democracies honor only the civil sacrament of voting, they resist turning over this authority to immigrants who can, in a mass democracy, vote their way into the pocketbooks and bank accounts of those who now reside in the hos~ nation. So, the residents want to limit immigrants to those who have equally large pocketbooks and bank accounts. Canada welcomes Hong Kongers who can bring large sums of money with them. Nations allow im- migrants to buy their way in. Closed borders are the price of political “open communion” — one man, one vote. Until Christians understand the principle of closed communion and excommunication in the Church (point four of the Church cove- nant), and until they link this by civil law with the exercise of the fkanchise (point four of the State covenant), they will not understand the biblical principle of open borders and sanctuary. It will take a paradigm shift of historic proportions to accomplish this transforma- tion. Christians will first have to abandon both Witherspoon and Madison, and for over two centuries, they have been unwilling to think about this, let alone do it.

They do not want to obey it. They also do not want the added responsibility that such knowledge inevitably brings. This is a psychological reason why Christians are generally premillennial and amillennial. It is not because they have personally spent a great deal of time examining the three major views of escha- tology. It is because they do not want to believe that God holds His people accountable for using His law to heal this world. If such heal- ing is possible, then Christians are responsible. Such healing is pos- sible; Christians are responsible. In America, there is a slogan: “Either sink or swim.” Premillennial- ism and amillennialism are eschatologies based on treading water. If the Church of Jesus Christ treads water long enough, we are assured, Jesus will come and throw it a life preserver, either just before the mil- lennium (premillennialism), just before the great tribulation (pre-trib dispensationalism), or at the end of history (arnillennialism). The premillennial fundamentalists and the amillennialist Lutherans are content with treading water culturally; they are ethi- cal dualists who believe in natural law and the legitimacy of political rule by the devil’s disciples during the era of the Church. The Calvin- istic Dutch followers of Kuyper, Dooyewewerd, and Schilder, how- ever, have a problem with this Arminian dualism. Unlike their water-treading brethren, they believe that there is an as-yet undis- covered Christian theory of swimming. So, as they tread furiously, decade after decade, they worry a lot about discovering this missing theory of swimming. Is it just a theory or is it real? Does it have spe- cifically y biblical content or is it cosmonomic, i.e., an empty box that floats on top of the water until you open it, whereupon it immedi- ately fills with water and sinks like a stone?w Dutch Calvinistic scholars worry a lot about this.

We have less and less breathing room. To switch metaphors, the lines between Christianity and humanism are being drawn more sharply. We have less room to maneuver. C. S. Lewis’ fictional col- lege professor said it well: “If you dip into any college, or school, or parish, or family – anything you like – at a given point in its history, you always find that there was a time before that point when there was more elbow room and contrasts weren’t quite so sharp; and that there’s going to be a time after that point when there is even less room for indecision and choices are even more momentous. Good is always getting better and bad is always getting worse: the possibili- ties of even apparent neutrality are always diminishing. The whole thing is sorting itself out all the time, coming to a point, getting sharper and harder.”Gl Sooner or later, the reality of this Vantillian-style prophecy will dawn on both sides of the two-edged sword of God’s covenant: there is no neutrali~. And when it does, both sides will give political pluralism the burial it deserves, before it stinks up the commonwealth even more. And after political pluralism has been in the grave for a cen- tury or so, people will look back in amazement at the period that began in Rhode Island in 1636, expanded nationally in 1789, and in- ternationally in the twentieth century.

In their refusal to be naturalized these concepts testify to man to the effect that he ought to accept that which his adopted principle requires him to re- ject. Thus the futility of his struggle with the problem of authority as well as with the problem of evil is itself a means by which God brings his pressure to bear upon men. Having a consciousness of their crea- turehood and with it a consciousness of ‘good and evil,” their need of authority is the sounding board against which the gospel comes to man.

The relationship between Christianity and culture is always reciprocal. The culture transforms the Christian at the same time the Christian transforms the culture. Hence as we assume our re- sponsibilities for the ‘transformation of culture,’ we should do so with an equal appreciation for the view that Niebuhr describes as ‘Christ and culture in paradox.’”3 Why would any Bible-believing Christian take seriously even for a moment Niebuhr’s concepts of “Christ the transformer of culture” or “Christ and culture in paradox”? Niebuhr’s Christ was a figment of his Barthian imagination, a force, not a person. But the trio could not resist referring to him, for their view of the absence of the cove- nant and its cownant sanctions in American history is far, far closer to Niebuhr’s false Christ than to the covenant God of the Bible. For this reason, we need to review Niebuhr’s theological views, for he ex- pressed the ethical viewpoint of virtually all “reputable” historians writing today.

In the Preface to his enormously influential history, 2% ~ing- o?om of God in America, Niebuhr wrote: “May I underscore some con- victions which this study has fostered in me and which are even stronger than appears in the book?

Everything with which we deal has many value relations; it has value for ourselves, for other men, for life, for reason, for the state, and so on. Though we start with the bold affirmation of faith that all men have sacred value, because all are related to God, and that they are therefore equal in value, yet we must also consider that all men are in relations to other finite beings, and that in these relations they do not have equal value. . . . Though truth has eternal value, value for God, it also stands in value relations to human reason, to life, to society in its order, to the self. Our work in culture is concerned with all these relative values of men, ideas, natural objects and processes. In justice we deal with the relative values of criminals and honest men for their fellow men; in economics we are con- cerned about the relative values of things and actions that are related to mil- lions of beings in multiple relations to each other. In every work of culture we relative men, with our relative points of view and relative evaluations, deal with relative values; thus we make our decisions. 7 Then he adds: “The recognition and acknowledgment of our relativity, however, does not mean that we are without an absolute .“B What absolute?

So also the performance of our relative duties in our particular times, places, and callings is far from being relativistic and self-assertive when it is carried out in obedience to the command of the Absolute. It does become relativistic and falsely absolute when I require that what is right for me be the whole right and nothing but the right; when I, in my relativity, demand that what I do in obedience be worthy of being regarded by myself, by other men and God, as right apart from all the complementary actions, the precedents and consequences in my own activity, the activity of my fellow 6.

He went on like this for another two pages, but you probably cannot stand much more of it. I can think of no more fitting evaluation of the literary style, not to mention theological con- tent, of H.

Harding: “He writes the worst English that I have ever encountered. It reminds me of a string of wet sponges; it reminds me of tattered washing on the line; it reminds me of stale bean soup, of college yells, of dogs barking idiotically through endless nights. It is so bad that a sort of grandeur creeps into it. It drags itself out of the dark abysm (I was about to write abscess!) of pish, and crawls in- sanely up to the topmost pinnacle of posh. It is rumble and bumble. It is flap and doodle. It is balder and dash.”ll What was Niebuhr getting at? Simple. He did not want to face the thought of a personal God who judges all men in terms of their personal commitment to His living, bodily resurrected, physically Incarnate Son. He did not want to accept the fact that God’s Son came into history in order to fulfill perfectly the specific terms of God’s covenant law, and that anyone who refuses to accept the work of Jesus Christ as his personal sacrificial substitute will spend eter- nity in screaming agony. Escape to the Noumenal To avoid thinking of these unpleasant things, Niebuhr the Apos- tate also abandoned along the way other unpleasant thoughts, such as covenant law, an infallible Bible, cognitive revelation from God to man, prayer that works, exorcism of real demons, creeds that ac- curately reflect the theological and ethical standards of God, and the 10, Ibid., pp. 239-40. 11.

Abandoning all this, Niebuhr adopted the language of Barthian liberalism, a language which reflects a personal commitment to anti-creedalism. His lan- guage resembled Kant’s nozsmenal realm of incoherence which is in no cognitive way connected to Kant’s phenomenal realm of predictable cause and effect. His philosophical dualism nearly destroyed his ability to write a coherent paragraph. At least his brother Reinhold wrote better prose. Writing of the brothers Niebuhr, along with several other Barthian theologians, Van Til comments: “In their theology, as in that of Barth it is in the last analysis the religious consciousness that divides itself into two sections after the style of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

But the natural man seeks to suppress this witness as well as that of his own nature. As a result, the only point of contact he tolerates is one which concedes his claim to autonomy. The only way the Christian can deal with this stub- born and wilful blindness is by “head-on collision,” by an all-out challenge to the natural man. He must reason by presupposition, and the ontological trinity, as taught in the Scriptures, is the presup- position of all human predication. All reasoning is by presupposition, but too little reasoning is con- sistently and self-consciously presuppositional. Some years ago, a Western trader found his work vastly enhanced by his half-white, half-Indian status. Among the Indians, he naturally and easily spoke his mother’s tongue, acted as one of them, and reasoned in terms of their culture and faith. Among the white miners and ranchers, he readily fell into his father’s ways, his father’s skepticism of Indian myth, and the white man’s sense of superiority. Although often ac- cu”sed of hypocrisy, a sin not uncomm~n among such m-ixed bloods and a source of advantage to them, this was not entirely true in his case. He shared in both ;utlooks and lived in unresolved” tension and frustration. In a sense, this is the position of the natural man today. A creature, created in God’s image, his entire being is revelational of God. To think coherently, he must presuppose God. In order to have science, he must begin with Christian assumptions and presuppose the unity of science and of knowledge. But, being fallen, he now pre- supposes his autonomy and attempts to suppress, wherever he be- comes conscious of its implications, this basic presupposition of God. As a result, his thinking is inconsistent, reveals his tension and frus- tration, and lacks an ep-istemological self-consciousness. To live con- sistently in terms of his autonomy would plunge him into the shore- less and bottomless ocean of relativity, but to live and think consist- ently in terms of the self-contained God would involve a total surren- der to His sovereignty. The natural man tries, as indeed too many regenerate men do also, to live in terms of both presuppositions, to have a foot in both camps and have the advantages offered by both God and Satan, but the results of this conscious and subconscious effort is tension and frustration.

But what he fails to note in this percep- tive essay is something he called to R. J. Rushdoony’s attention dur- ing a taped discussion they had regarding the theological foundation of the Constitution. Scott, over Rushdoony’s protest, identified the Constitutional Convention accurately: a successful effort by lawyers to overcome Christianity. 5 Thus, if we are to achieve Scott’s two-fold goal – the restoration of Christianity as it once prevailed in this na- tion and Constitutional restoration – we must return to the expressly Christian oaths of the state constitutions of 1787, the constitutions that prevailed before the Philadelphia lawyers displaced them by means of a new national oath, an oath that refused to acknowledge the sovereign God of history who had made possible this nation’s ex- periment in freedom. We must no longer ignore Scott’s analysis: “The United States is the only government in the history of the world that has been established without a god . . . without specifically acknowledging any definition of any religion. The Constitution of 1789 was unique in that respect. No society had ever done that .“6 Ac- tually, Rhode Island had, but that experiment in pluralism was pro- tected by a larger commonwealth. Beginning in the eighteenth century in Northern Europe, anti- Trinitarian humanists combined with dissenting (non-State-established) churchmen and Deists 7 to restructure the existing basis of citizen- ship, which had previously been explicitly Christian. The two wings of the Enlightenment, Scottish empiricism and French a Pn”orz” ration- alism, both proclaimed a new concept of citizenship: citizenship without a required profession of faith in the God of the Bible. It was this new concept of citizenship which was ratified into law in the United States in 1788. 3.

He views early American thought as a mixture of Christianity and natural law, which it was, but not as being at bottom dominated by the key foun- dation of Enlightenment thought: the doctrine of the autonomy of man’s reason. He has always refused to say of the Constitution, as he said in Chapter 1 of By What Standard? regarding every other “hybrid world-view,” every other compromise with the intellectual systems of self-professed autonomous man: “Behold it was Leah!” He assumed that the colonists’ faith in the Christian God was more fundamental than their faith in Enlightenment thought. This was no doubt true of considerable segments of the population, especially after the revivals of the second quarter of the century. But this was not true of the intel- lectual leaders of the Revolutionary War era, who were overwhelm- ingly Deist (proto-Unitarian) in outlook. On this point, at least with respect to those men who wrote defenses of the War, C, Gregg Singer’s view of the American Revolution is correct. 6 I think that May’s assessment is fair: “. . . most forms of the Enlightenment de- veloped among the middle and upper classes of European cities, spread mainly among similar groups in America, and failed to reach the agrarian majority. On the whole, various forms of Protestant Christianity served the emotional needs of most Americans better.”g But when we inquire about the beliefs of the articulate leadership of the nation, especially the triumphant nationalists of 1789, we find that the philosophy of the Scottish wing of the Enlightenment was dominant. The Two Wings of the Enlightenment Rushdoony repeatedly refers to the anti-French Revolution atti- tude that prevailed in the last decade of eighteenth-century America. He offers this as evidence of an attitude hostile to the Enlighten- ment. What he never says is that he is defining “Enlightenment” solely in terms of its left-wing ideology: the philosopher of France. 8.

Edmund Burke had been the most eloquent opponent of the French Revolution from the very beginning, and nineteenth-century European conservative intellectual thought was overwhelmingly Burkean. Yet Burke was surely a representative thinker of the right wing of the Enlightenment. He was a correspondent with Adam Smith, David Hume, and other Scottish Enlightenment figures. His conservative philosophy of pluralism and social traditionalism agreed with their classical liberal doctrine of social evolutionism. This outlook is reflected in Burke’s statement that “The science of constructing a commonwealth, or renovating it, or reforming it, is, like every other experimental science, not to be taught a pn”ori. Nor is it a short experience that can instruct us in that practical science, be- cause the real effects of moral causes are not always immediate; . . .”12 Burke had been a supporter of the American Revolution, actually serving as the paid London agent-lobbyist of the New York Legisla- ture right up until the War broke out. 13 His defense was that the British Parliament should ‘leave the Americans as they anciently stood.” 14 Was this opinion inherently conservative, liberal, or 10.

Rushdoony did not understand in 1964 the ex- tent to which his view and Van Ti.1’s had broken with the American intellectual and political tradition. That tradition was grounded in natural law and natural rights theory. Rushdoony did not recognize in 1964 what ought to be obvious to any person who has read the tracts and treatises of that Constitutional generation: the American Deists of the second half of the eighteenth century adopted the same strategy of infiltration that the followers of neo-orthodox theologians Karl Barth and Emil Brunner adopted in the twentieth century, 22.

In fact, this process of infiltration has been going on in Christianity since the second cen- tury, as Van Til argued throughout his career. The difference by 1770, however, was that the anti-Christians in America were self- consciously using these alien Greek and Roman Stoic concepti to undermine the religious and especially the judicial foundations of what was then clearly a Christian society. Earlier Christians had ap- pealed to natural law philosophy as a support for orthodoxy; the main Framers of Constitutional nationalism – Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, Hamilton, John Adams, and MadisonZG – used natural law philosophy as a tool to undermine orthodoxy. Historian David Hawke is correct regarding Jefferson’s writing of the Declara- tion of Independence: “He did more than summarize ideas accepted by all thoughtful Americans of the time. He intentionally gave new implications to old terms.”zz Rushdoony’s Error: Judicial Continuity I think Rushdoony’s error has been both emotional and intellec- tual. He sees himself as one who is calling for a return to the theolog- ical and judicial foundations of the American experiment in free- dom. This experiment was grounded in the Bible. But in his attempt to trace his own worldview back to the Framers, he has neglected to adhere to the principles he learned from Van Til. He has not acknowledged the extent of the religious war that was in principle going on in the eighteenth-century American colonies. This is in direct contrast to anti-covenantal historians like Nell, Hatch, and Marsden, who have chosen to ignore the explicitly Christian cove- nantal foundations of pre-Constitution America, because they can point to the U.S. Constitution as the covenanting document of the nation. They understand what Rushdoony has long refused to ad- mit: the US. Constitution i$ judicial~ anti-Christian. It is an explicitly covenantal document; it is also explicitly not Christian.

Such a view of judicial sovereignty, he says, had been foreign to American political philosophy prior to 1789, for American political philosophy had been primarily Christian and Calvinist. He admits, however, that the terminology of popular sov- ereignty had been influenced by the doctrine of the political sover- eignty of the people. 28 The problem with this line of reasoning is that there is no way to distinguish judicial sovereignty from political sovereignty in the doc- uments of the Revolutionary War era. The Delaware Declaration of Rights of 1776 begins with this declaration: “That all governments of right originates from the people, is founded in compact only, and in- stituted solely for the good of the whole.”m The state constitutions usually began with a statement of natural rights. While no other state constitution began with a formal declaration of popular sover- eignty, they all had a section stating this principle. Section V of Mas- sachusetts spoke of ‘All power residing originally in the people, and being derived from them. . . . “ 30 This means, it continued, that all public officials are answerable to the people. The same declaration of the people’s sovereignty was in Section VIII. Officials are “at all times accountable to” the people. 31 By formally announcing the will of the people as politically sov- ereign, the constitutional documents revealed the extent to which the older theocratic foundations had been steadily undermined since John Locke’s Second Treatise on Government. The supposedly religiously neutral common-ground philosophy of natural law was believed in by all participants. The language of political sovereignty is found in all the state constitutions of the Revolutionary War era. It is also found in Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England, the com- mon legal textbook of English common law, which was read widely in the colonies just before the outbreak of the Revolution. Rush- doony notes that nearly 2,500 copies of the Commentaries were sold in the colonies in the decade prior to the Revolution. 32 Nevertheless, 28. R. J.

Rushdoony’s chapter on sovereignty I regard as the weakest in This Independent Republic. He makes it look as though the Constitu- tion possessed a judicial continuity with Christianity. It did not. It represented a fundamental break from Christianity, a break that the Lockean concept of humanistic sovereignty and civil compact had been preparing for almost a century. Rushdoony still believes that a restoration of Constitutional order is the best strategy for Christian Reconstruction in the United States. Not only is this impossible es- chatologically — time does not move backward — but it is naive judi- cially. In his desire to make the case for Christian America, he closed his eyes to the judicial break from Christian America: the ratification of the Constitution. The Christian cultural continuity of America was not able to be sustained by subsequent generations; the judicial break with Christianity had been definitive. l Rushdoony’s Rewriting of Constitutional History It is this covenantal fact which Rushdoony, in his 30-year defense of the Constitution as an implicitly Christian document, has refused to face. Indeed, he has created a whole mythology regarding the oath in order to buttress his case. To an audience of Australian Christians, who could not be expected to be familiar with the U.S. Constitution, he said in 1983: “In every country where an oath of office is required, as is required in the United States by the Constitu- tion, the oath has reference to swearing to almighty God to abide by His covenant, invoking the cursings and blessings of God for obedi- 33.

Exactly the opposite: “no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.” To put it mildly, this was deliberate deception. Rushdoony is determined not to face the facts of the U.S. Constitution, and he does not want his audience to do so, either. To his own American audiotape audience, Rushdoony insisted: “The Constitution required an oath of office. To us this doesn’t mean much. Then it meant that you swore to Almighty God and involved all the curses and blessings of Deuteronomy 28 and Leviticus 26 for obedience and disobedience. Nobody knows that anymore.”37 Nobody knew it then, either. Deuteronomy 28 was about as far from George Washington’s mind as might be imagined. Rushdoony has never offered so much as a footnote supporting such a claim with respect to the U.S. Constitution. The story is mythical. What he has done is to pretend that the Trinitarian oath-taking that did take place at the state level had become a Christian oath-taking ceremony at the federal level. The opposite is the case, and it was the statist ele- ment of the federal oath which steadily replaced the theistic oaths in the states. How, in good conscience, could he announce this to his fol- lowers? “An oath to the men who wrote the Constitution was a Bibli- cal fact and a social necessity.”3s If this was true, then why did they exclude God from the mandatory oath? They well understood the importance of oaths. 39 They i~sisted on a required oath as the judi- 36.

Mackey, the Masonic historian: “It is objected that the oath is atten’ded with a penalty of a serious or capital nature. If this be the case, it does not appear that the expression of a penalty of any nature whatever can affect the purport or augment the solemnity of an oath, which is, in fact, an attestation of God to the truth of a declaration, as a witness and avenger; and hence every oath in- cludes in itself, and as its very essence, the covenant of God’s wrath, the heaviest of all penalties, as the necessary consequence of its violation.” Albert G.

Their insistence on the importance of oaths was not because they were all Christians; it was because so many of the leaders were Freemasons. w They had sworn to a Masonic self- maledictory blood oath, for there was (and is) no other way to become a Mason. This is the most crucial neglected topic in the historio- graphy of the Revolutionary War era, and especially the Constitu- tional Convention, which Rushdoony has known about from the be- ginning of his published career, 41 but which he has categorically refused to discuss publicly. The reader must search his footnotes for the appropriate bibliographical leads, and very few readers do this. He only discusses Freemasonry in relation to the French Revolution, which he knows was pagan to the core, and in relation to New Eng- land in the nineteenth century. He insists that “This decline came later. At the time of the Revolution and much later, New England and the rest of the country shared a common faith and experience.”4 2 Mytho-Histo~ Absolutely crucial to his interpretation of Constitutional history is what he never mentions: the legally secular (“neutral”) character of Article VI, Clause 3. He pretends that it does not says what it says, and it does not mean what it has always meant: a legal barrier to Christian theocracy. Instead, he rewrites history: 40. James D.

But the legal steps towards secularization were only taken in the 1950’s and 1960’s by the U.S. Supreme Court. For the sake of argument [!! ! ! ! – G.N. ], we may concede to the liberal, and to some ortho- dox Christian scholars,43 that Deism had made extensive inroads into America by 1776, and 1787, and that the men of the Constitutional Conven- tion, and Washington, were influenced by it. The fact still remains that they did not attempt to create a secular state. The states were Christian states, and the federal union, while barred from intervention in this area, was not itself secular. The citizens were citizens of their respective states and of the United States simultaneously. They could not be under two sets of religious law. 44 This is mytho-history designed to calm the fears of Bible-believing Christians as they look back to the origin of the Constitution. Of course the Framers created a secular state. The secular character of the federal union was established by the oath of office. Politically, the Framers could not in one fell swoop create a secular state in a Chris- tian country; judicially and covenantally, they surely did. Hamilton made it clear in Federalist 27 that the oath of allegiance to the Consti- tution superseded all state oaths. That was why he insisted on it. Yet Rushdoony substitutes the language of Church worship when speak- ing of early American politics: “Officers of the federal government, president and congress, worshiped as an 05cial body, but without preference extended to a single church.”45 This was true enough, but it implied a great deal more than denominational neutrality; it im- plied secularism. It led directly to the rise of religious pluralism, in which Christianity receives no notice as the nation’s religion. Today’s secularism is not simply the product of Chief Justice Earl Warren and his court, let alone the theology of Madalyn Murray O’Hair. It was implicit from 1789. It was made official in February, 1860, when the House of Representatives invited the first rabbi to give the invocation, only a few years after the first synagogue was es- tablished in Washington. They invited a New York rabbi, since no 43. He seems to have in mind here C.

This was not the product of nineteenth-century Free- masonry. It was the product of late eighteenth-century Freemasonry. It was an outworking of Article VI, Clause 3. That a President might, as Washington did (and George Bush did two centuries later) swear his non-religious oath of office with his hand on a Masonic Bible, is legally and covenantally irrelevant. (That this same copy of the Bible was used by four other Presidents at their inaugurations is surely symbolically significant. ) 47 An oath, to ‘be judicially binding, must be verbal. It must call down God’s sanctions on the oath-taker. This is what is specifically made illegal by the U.S. constitution. Any implied sanctions are secular, not divine. Without this self-valedictory aspect, a symbolic gesture is not a valid biblical oath. Rushdoony knows this, which is why he has invented the myth of the Levitical and Deuteronomic “almost-oath.” The Presidents have thrown a sop of a symbol to the Christians – one hand on a Bible while taking an explicitly and legally non-Christian oath — and the Christians have accepted this as being somehow pleasing in God’s eyes. Covenants and Sanctions Every covenant has sanctions. Without sanctions, there is no covenant. Rushdoony knows this, which is why he invokes Leviticus 26 and Deuteronomy 28: they set forth God’s sanctions in history. The Constitution is a covenant document. He writes that “the Con- stitution is not only a law but also a contract or covenant.”48 The question is: Whose sanctions are invoked by this covenant docu- ment ? Clearly, autonomous man’s sanctions. Rushdoony knows this. So he has restructured U. S. political theory to create a justifica- tion of this absence of any reference to God’s law or God’s sanctions: “Second, we must remember that the Constitution can make no man 46. Bertram W.

It does not give us a substan- tive morality, but it does reflect a procedural morality.”4g Notice, first, that this is basically the same language he first in- troduced on his interview with Bill Meyers on national television. This essay uses terms that are found in “technical legal discussions; we do not find anything like ~is language in his earlier writings. Perhaps he consulted a law professor. If so, he weakened his theolog- ical case. Law professors are concerned with procedure because of the nature of the adversarial system of American law. Modern legal theory assumes that substantive (righteous) judgment is the result of procedurally rigorous but morally neutral confrontations between lawyers. Contrast this outlook with what Rushdoony wrote in 1975: “In the Anglo-American tradition of jurisprudence, the Biblical rev- elation has been decisive. The purpose of law is to codify and enforce the moral system of Biblical faith. The common law embodied this purpose.”50 Christian constitutional law is codj$ed biblical law, not procedural neutrality. What he refuses to ask is this: What #judicial procedure is not reli- gious~ neutral? It should be an obvious question for Rushdoony; he has made it his standard practice in all other areas of his writings to deny the possibility of religious neutrality in any area of life. If judi- cial procedure is not religious y neutral, then it is either covenant- keeping or covenant-breaking procedure. Covenant-breaking pro- cedure will tend to produce immoral outcomes. It is not so’me neu- tral judicial tool. This should be obvious to anyone who has studied Van Til; it is not obvious to Rushdoony, or even a question to be considered, when he discusses the U.S. Constitution. He adopts the epistemological position of eighteenth-century humanism whenever he discusses the Constitution. Making People Good Second, notice the shift in his argument: the Constitution cannot make anyone good. This is the standard humanist line against all Christian legislation: “You can’t legislate morality!” What Rush- doony has always maintained is that you can’t legislate anything except morality.

BY ]Ztw, cer- tain acts are abolished, and the persons committing those acts either executed or brought into conformity to law.”52 Of course the Constitution cannot make anyone good; the func- tion of biblical civil law is not to make anyone good; it is to suppress public evil. Rushdoony has said this clearly: “It is impossible to sepa- rate morality from law, because civil law is simply one branch of moral law, and morality is the foundation of law. Laws cannot make men good; that is the work of the Holy Spirit. But laws can prevent men from doing evil.”53 Again, while “man can be restrained by strict law and order, he cannot be changed by law; he cannot be saved by law.”54 For 30 years, Rushdoony previously had argued that any other view of civil law is the “works doctrine” of all non-Christian re- ligion: salvation by law. This is humanism’s view, he always insisted: ‘Humanistic law aims at saving man and remaking society. For hu- manism, salvation is an act of state .“5 5 Again, “Man finds salvation through political programs, through legislation, so that salvation is an enactment of the state.”5G What is the Christian alternative? To enforce God’s law and God’s sanctions in history, and on.~ God’s law and God’s sanctions. The second aspect of man under law is that man’s relationship to law be- comes ministerial, not legislative, that is, man does not create law, does not decree what shall be right and wrong simply in terms of his will. Instead, man seeks, in his law-making, to approximate and administer fundamental law, law in terms of God’s law, absolute right and wrong. Neither majority nor minority wishes are of themselves right or wrong; both are subject to judgment in terms of the absolute law of God, and the largest majority can- not make valid and true a law contrary to the word of God. All man’s law- making must be in conformity to the higher law of God, or it is false. 57 51. Rushdoony, The Institutes of Biblical Law (Nutley, New Jersey: Craig Press, 1973), p. 292.

The law is justice, and it is order, godly order, and there can be neither true order nor true law apart from justice, and justice is defined in terms of Scripture and its revelation of God’s law and righteousness. The law cannot be made more than justice. It cannot be made into an instrument of salva- tion without destruction to justice. Salvation is not by law but by the grace of God through Jesus Christ. 5s The issue is justice, not salvation. So, why does he now raise the spurious issue that the Constitution “can make no man nor nation good; it is not a moral code”? This is utter nonsense; eve~ law-order is a moral code. Until he got on national television, this had been Rush- doony’s refrain for 30 years! As he wrote in the Institutes, there is “an absolute moral order to which man must conform.”59 He insisted therefore that “there can be no tolerance in a law-system for another religion. Toleration is a device used to introduce a new law-system as a prelude to a new intolerance .“60 In this sentence, he laid the theological foundation for a biblical critique of the U.S. Constitution as a gigantic religious fraud, a rival covenant, “a device used to in- troduce a new law-system as a prelude to a new intolerance ,“ which it surely was and has become. But he has been blinded for 30 years by his love of the Constitution. In a showdown between his theocratic theology and the U.S. Constitution, he chose the Constitution. Prohibiting Judicial Evil He says that it will do no good for Christians to appeal to the Constitution. “The Constitution can restore nothing, nor can it make the courts or the people just .“61 The courts are the enforcing arm of the Constitution, yet it supposedly cannot make the courts good. Of course it cannot; but a constitution can and must prohibit evil, lawless decisions by lower courts. It must reverse all lower court de- cisions that are not in conformity to the fundamental law of the land. This is the doctrine of judicial review. This is the whole idea of American Constitutional law. Rushdoony knows this. In 1973, he appealed to that crucial covenantal and legal concept: sanctions. He warned Christians that the concept of treason is inescapably religious: 58. Ibid. , p. 144. 59. Rushdoony, Imtitutes, p. 18. 60. Ibid., p. 5. 61.

The law-order of humanism leads only to anarchy. Lacking ab- solutes, a humanistic law-order tolerates everything which denies absolutes while warring against Biblical faith. The only law of humanism is ulti- mately this, that there is no law except self-assertion. It is “Do what thou Wilt. n . . . To tolerate an alien law-order is a very real subsidy of it: it is a warrant for life to that alien law-order, and a sentence of death against the established law-order. 62 The Death Warrant The Framers at the Constitutional Convention issued a death warrant against Christianity, but for tactical reasons, they and their spiritual heirs refused for several generations to deliver it to the in- tended victims. They covered this covenanta.1 death sentence with a lot of platitudes about the hand of Providence, the need for Morality, the grand design of the universe, and similar Masonic shibboleths. The death sentence was officially delivered by the Fourteenth Amendment. It has been carried out with escalating enthusiasm since the 1950’s. But Rushdoony dares not admit this chain of cove- nantal events. He writes as though everything humanistic in Ameri- can life is the product of a conspiracy of New England’s Unitarians and the radical Republicans of the Civil War era. To admit the his- torical truth of 1787-89 would mean that a restoration of so-called “original American Consdtutionalism” would change nothing cove- nantally.

The question must be raised: In terms of the U.S. Constitution, what constitutes treason, Christian- ity or pluralism (secular humanism)? If you want to see the change in Rushdoony’s thinking, consider these observations: [1973: ] The question thus is a basic one: what constitutes treason in a culture? Idolatry j i.e., treason to God, or treason to the state? 63 [1973:] Because for Biblical law the foundation is the one true God, the central offense is therefore treason to that God by idolatry. Every law-order has its concept of treason. . . . Basic to the health of a society is the integrity of its foundation. To allow tampering with its foundation is to allow its total subversion.

Consequently, the entire scheme of this equity of which we are now speaking has been prescribed in it. . . .

For others are not preferred to it when they are more approved, not by a simple comparison, but with regard to the condition of times, place, and nation; or when that law is abrogated which was never enacted for us.

It is an affirmation of neu- trality that cannot possibly exist, if Van Til is correct. Constitutional procedure is the covenantal development of the religious foundation of that covenant: in Church, State, and family. To argue that a system of covenantal procedural sanctions is anything but a judicial devel- opment of the underlying covenantal law-order is to adopt a domestic version of the natural law (equity) of nations, and we know what Rushdoony used to think of that idea! 72 Rushdoony today admits that there is nothing in the U.S. Con- stitution to protect itself from the transformation from substantive (ethical) law to procedural (bureaucratic) law. “The U.S. Constitu- tion gives us no substantive morality, only a procedural one .“ 73 This worldwide legal transformation is the crisis of Western civilization, writes Harvard legal historian Harold J. Berman, 74 yet Rushdoony says that the U.S. Constitution is inherently powerless to do any- thing about it. Saying this of the U.S. Constitution — that it is only a procedural document – is the same as saying that logic is only pro- cedural, or liturgy is only procedural, or Church government is only procedural, or that family government is only procedural. In short, he is saying what Van Til denied: that form can be segregated from content, ethically speaking. Rushdoony wrote in the ln~titutes that “The basic premise of the modern doctrine of toleration is that all re- ligious and moral positions are equally true and equally false.”75 This is exactly the worldview which the Framers wrote into the Con- stitution when they abolished a religious test oath for holding federal office. I cannot avoid the obvious conclusion: if a defense of the U.S. Constitution as being somehow inherently Christian, or in some way fundamentally conformable to Christianity, is the position of the Christian Reconstruction movement, this means the suicide of Christian Reconstructionism.

And for a law- order to forsake its self-protection is both wicked and suicidal.”76 Defending Madison Rushdoony correctly observes that politicians understand that each group votes its conscience andlor its pocketbook; the politicians know that there is no neutrality. Factions are a denial of the myth of neutrality, he argues. 77 This is a correct observation. He calls the politicians hypocrites. This is an unfair accusation. If they are hypo- crites, then anyone who defends the U.S. Constitution while also denying neutrality is equally vulnerable to this accusation of hypo- crisy. In the American political tradition, factions are an institu- tional affirmation of neutrality. Rushdoony knows very well where the theory of the “politics of faction” comes from: James Madison’s Federalist JO. But his love of the Constitution makes him a necessary supporter of Madison. In one of the most startling about-faces in intellectual history — page 68 vs. page 73 — he assures us that Madison did not believe in neutral- ity.rs “First of all, Madison denied the doctrine of neutralism. He denied the Enlightenment faith in the objectivity of reason, which, in Christian terms, he saw as inalienably tied to self-love. Man’s rea- soning is thus not objective reasoning; it is personal reasoning and will thus be governed by ‘the nature of man’ rather than an abstract concept of rationality.”’g This, quite frankly, makes no sense. If you doubt me, read it again. If taken literally, it would lead to a dead end for all public policy, institutional paralysis in the name of Constitu- tional law. If a civil government makes any decision, it must do so in terms of a particular moral and legal framework. It usually does so in the name of the common good. There is no such thing as neutral common good. Madison hated the churches, hated Christianity, and self-consciously devised the Constitution to create multiple factions that would cancel each other out. But he obviously had to make a crucial though unstated assumption: that whatever remains after the 76. Ibid., p. 89. 77. Rushdoony, Nature of the American System, p. 68. 78. Ibid., pp. 73. 79.

The fact that Madison did not appeal to an abstract concept of rationalist y is irrelevant; the Framers, both individually and as a fac- tion, always balanced their appeals to abstract rationality with an appeal to historical experience. This, as Van Til argues, is what cov- enant-breaking men have done from the beginning. This is the old Parmenides-Heraclitus dualism. Madison appealed to reason, expe- rience, common sense, morality, and any other slogan he could get his hands on. “The free system of government we have established is so congenial with reason, with common sense, and with universal feeling, that it must produce approbation and a desire of imitation, as avenues may be found for truth to the knowledge of nations .“ 80 So did his colleagues. There men were politicians, first and foremost. If a slogan would sell the Constitution, good; if an brilliant idea would, excellent; if a convoluted or improbable argument would, fine. It was all grist for their Unitarian mill. Christians should not be de- ceived, especially self-deceived. James Madison was a covenant-breaking genius, and the heart and soul of his genius was his commitment to religious neutralism. He devised a Constitution that for two centuries has fooled even the most perceptive Christian social philosophers of each generation into thinking that Madison was not what he was: a Unitarian theocrat whose goal was to snuff out the civil influence of the Trinitarian churches whenever they did not support his brainchild. For two cen- turies, his demonic plan has worked. Rushdoony’s equating of Enlightenment rationalism with a priori rationalism, and then his denial that the Americans ever affirmed a priori rationalism, is at the heart of his general myth that there was never a serious Enlightenment in colonial America. It is also at the heart of the traditional conservatives’ myth that Burkean conser- vatism was not part of the Enlightenment. Both views are myths. Burke adopted and promoted the social evolutionary worldview of the Scottish Enlightenment. The Scots were all intellectual colleagues. They were all members of the right wing of the Enlightenment, just as F. A. Hayek is. There was no one left on either side of the Atlantic who was publicly preaching the Puritan view of the covenant, meaning 80.

They had all returned to the leeks and onions of Egypt. The point is, in order to make public policy, there must be a con- cept of the common good. Biblically, there are only two choices available: a covenant-keeping common good or a covenant-breaking common good. The best that can be said for a covenant-breaking common good is that it may correspond outwardly to God’s revealed law’s standards for public policy. It is therefore a common grace com- mon good. But as Christianity fades in influence, and as covenant- breakers become more consistent, this element of common grace will necessarily fade. This is what has happened all over the world as Christianity has been replaced by either right wing Enlightenment empiricism-experimentalism or left wing Enlightenment a priorism. It does not make any long-term difference whether the legal system is based on humanistic common law or humanistic Napoleonic law; the end result is humanism. There is no neutrality. The Question of Sovereignty Rushdoony’s rewriting of U. S. history has gone on from the be- ginning. In the Institutes, he says that “The presidential oath of office, and every other oath of office in the United States, was in earlier years recognized precisely as coming under the third command- ment, and, in fact, invoking it. By taking the oath, a man promised to abide by his word and his obligations even as God is faithful to His word. If he failed, by his oath of office, the public official invoked divine judgement and the curse of the law upon himself.”8i This is Presidential mytho-history. Rushdoony’s view of U. S. political history is heavily influenced by a bizarre idea that he picked up in a speech by President John Quincy Adams,” who shared his President father’s Unitarian theol- ogy. So far as I know, no one else has maintained the following inter- pretation: the U.S. Constitution rests on no concept of God because the Framers believed that only God has legal sovereignty. In his brief chapter on “Sovereignty,” Rushdoony writes of American thought in the 1780’s, “Legal sovereignty was definitely denied. . . . “ 83 He says this distrust of legal sovereignty “was both early medieval and Cal- 81.

The thesis is suffi- ciently peculiar that some reference to primary source documenta- tion is mandatory, but none is offered. He refuses to define what he means by qegal sovereignty,” which makes things even more diffi- cult. He cites some historians on Americans’ opposition to the sover- eign State, but it is clear from the context that their hostility was to a centralized, monopolistic sovereignty, which is not the point Rush- doony is trying to make. The question Rushdoony has been attempting for three decades to avoid answering from the historical record is this one: Why did the Framers refuse to include a Trinitarian oath? If the states had such oaths — and they did — and the Patriot party regarded the col- onies as legal, sovereign civil governments under the King, which is the thesis of This Independent Republic, then why not impose the oath requirement nationally? The presence of an oath is basic to any cov- enant, as Rushdoony knows. The question is: Who is the iden- tifiable sovereign in the federal covenant? And the answer of the Framers was clear, “We the People.” Not we the states, but “We the people.” It is right there in the Preamble. We the People Patrick Henry had been invited to attend the Philadelphia con- vention, but he had refused. He recognized what was implicitly being asserted in the Preamble. In the Virginia debate over ratifica- tion in 1788, he spoke out against ratification. He warned against the implications of ‘We the People”: Give me leave to demand, what right had they to say, We the People,” in- stead of We the States”? States are the characteristics, and the soul of a confederation. If the States be not the agents of this compact, it must be one great consolidated national government of the people of all the States. . . . Had the delegates, who were sent to Philadelphia a power to propose a con- solidated government instead of a confederacy? Were they not deputed by States, and not by the people? The assent of the people, in their collective capacity, is not necessary to the formation of a federal government. The people have no right to enter into leagues, alliances, or confederations: they are not the proper agents for this purpose: States and sovereign powers are the only proper agents for this kind of government.

That they exceeded their power is perfectly clear.”84 Rushdoony, for all his praise of Henry’s Christianity, has steadfastly refused to dis- cuss the religious and judicial foundation of Henry’s opposition to ratification. This is not an oversight on Rushdoony’s part. He knows exactly why Henry objected. Henry recognized that the Constitu- tion rested on a revolutionary break from American law. It was a broken covenant. The Constitution was ratified under the presumption of the SOV- ereignty of the people. But this was more than mere presumption: it is right there at the beginning of the document. Here is why there is no Trinitarian oath in the Constitution: the Framers were operating under the legal fiction that the sovereign People, not the God of the Bible, had authorized the new national covenant . 85 ‘We the People” were not the vassals of the Great King in this treaty; ‘We the People” were the great king, and there shall be no other gods beside “We the People.” Thus, the Framers outlawed religious oaths. Outlawed ! Yet this crucial Constitutional provision is rarely mentioned today. The humanist defenders of the Constitution automatically assume it, and the Christian defenders either do not recognize its importance or else do not want to face its obvious implications. Instead, the debate has focused on Congress and the freedom of religion. This provision is not the heart of the Constitutional covenant; it is merely an applica- tion of it. The oath is central in any covenant. On~ Earth~ Sovereign~ It was hardly the case that the Framers had no concept of earthly legal sovereignty. It was that they had on@ a concept of earthly legal sovereign y. They announced a divine right — not of kings, not of leg- islatures, but of the People. The divine right of kings doctrine meant that no one and no institution could appeal any decision of the king; he was exclusive~ sovereign under God. This was exactly what the oath of Article VI, Clause 3 was intended to convey: no appeal. The national government was the final voice of the people, for it operated 84.

This was why the Framers insisted on requiring an oath of allegiance to the Constitution that made illegal any judicial allegiance to God by federal officers. The oath made the federal government sovereign. This is exactly what Hamilton announced in Federalist 27.s6 Yet Rushdoony is still using this bit of mytho-history regarding the idea of sovereignty in the early American period in order to justify his defense of the Constitution. “The Constitution is unique in world history in that there is no mention of sovereignty, because sovereignty was recognized as being an attribute of God.” s ’ Indeed, it truly was ‘ seen as an attribute of God, and the Framers identified this god: the People. The transformation of Rushdoony’s biblical judicial theology of the early 1970’s into a theological defense of judicial neutrality in the late 1980’s was accurately predicted . . . by Rushdoony: “If a doc- trine of authority embodies contradictions within itself, then it is eventually bound to fall apart as the diverse strains war against one another. This has been a continuing part of the various crises of Western civilization. Because the Biblical doctrine of authority has been compromised by Greco-Roman humanism, the tensions of au- thority have been sharp and bitter.”ss No sharper and no more bitter than in the remarkable case of Rushdoony u. Rushdoony. 86. Rushdoony has pointed to an incident late in Hamilton’s career that indicates Christian faith, Hamilton’s cafl to create a Christian political party just before he was killed. He relates this in his taped lecture on Leviticus 8:1-13. What Rushdoony is referring to is Hamilton’s 1802 call for a “Christian Constitu- tional Society.” This society was not to be a separate political party, but a means of challenging atheism in politics generally, especially the Jeffersonians. It was to be a network of political clubs. He also proposed the creation of charitable societies, a Christian welfare program. Hamilton’s biographer Jacob Cooke points out that this concern for Christianity came only after he had lost all political influence nationally. “Perhaps never in all American political history has there been a fall from power so rapid, so complete, so finaf as Hamilton’s in the period from October, 1799, to November, 1800 .“ Cooke, Akxander Hamilton: A Projle (New York: Hill & Wang, 1967), p. 246. While Cooke believes that Hamilton was actually transformed inter- nally, he ties this to this to his loss of politicaf influence. In short, when he had power, Hamilton was not a Christian, and he helped to destroy the remaining Christian civil foundations of the national government. 87.

To read the Constitution as the charter for a secular state is to misread history, and to misread it radically. The Constitution was designed to perpetuate a Christian order.”89 He has never retreated from this position; indeed, he has escalated his commitment to it — so much so, that he has now under- cut the covenantal foundation of The Institutes of Biblical Law. The problem with the U.S. Constitution was and is polytheism. Rushdoony has described the problem of political polytheism: “Modern political orders are polytheistic imperial states, but the churches are not much better. To hold, as the churches do, Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Lutheran, Calvinist, and all others vir- tually, that the law was good for Israel, but that Christians and the church are under grace and without law, or under some higher, newer law, is implicit polytheism .“ 90 But he has always refused to identify the obvious polytheism of the Constitution. Thus, he has had to explain modern political pluralism as a deviation from the Constitution rather than its inevitable product. The ratification of the U.S. Constitution in June of 1788 created a new nation based on a new covenant. It placed the new nation under a ‘higher, newer law.” The nation had broken with its Chris- tian judicial roots by covenanting with a new god, the sovereign Peo- ple. There would be no other God tolerated in the political order. There would be no appeal beyond this sovereign god. That collective god, speaking through the federal government, began its inevitable expansion, predicted by the Antifederalists, most notably Patrick Henry. The secularization of the republic began in earnest. This process has not yet ceased. Nevertheless, the surrender to secular humanism was not an overnight process. The rise of abolitionism, the coming of the Civil War, the advent of Darwinism, the growth of immigration, the spread of the franchise, the development of the public school system, and a host of other social and political influences have all worked to transform the interdenominational American civil religion into a re- 89.

The golden calves may not be on the hilltops, but the theology is the same: reli- gion exists to serve the needs of the State, and the State is sovereign over the material things of this world. “There are many forms of idol worship. The worship of the U.S. Constitution has been a popular form of this ancient practice, especially in conservative Christian circles. The sanctions of the pre-Constitutiona.l colonial covenants are still binding in God’s court. One cannot break covenant with the Great King. He will bring additional negative sanctions unless those origi- nal covenants are renewed. This, however, requires that we break covenant with the present god of this age, the People. The People are under God as legally protected vassals. If this is not acknowledged covenantally and formally, then the common people will eventually find themselves under tyrants as legally unprotected vassals. Anabaptism or Couenantalism Why has Rushdoony steadfastly refused to see this? The easiest explanation is covenantal. He has always refused to acknowledge the ecclesiastical aspects of theocratic civil government. He has correctly seen that the institutional Church should not give orders to the State, but he has never faced the hard question of the suffrage: How can non-Trinitarians be allowed to vote in a theocratic nation? Obvi- ously, they would not be allowed to vote. Those not under the cove- nant cannot be allowed to impose civil sanctions. This raises the question of which covenantal authority, or more to the point, authorities? Who is to determine whether a person is a Christian? There can be only one Bible-based answer: a Trinitarian local assembly or synod. A person can be regarded as a Christian only if he is a member in good standing in a local assembly or pres- bytery. Everyone else is outside a church covenant and therefore cut off from the sacraments and the discipline of excommunication. Judicially speaking, a person who does not have legal access to the sacraments is not a Christian, nor is someone who refuses to take the sacraments.

Those who refuse are outside the Church covenant. Therefore, in a theocratic republic, they would not be entitled to impose civil sanctions. This raises the other question that he has always avoided: the State must identify which churches are Trinitarian and therefore whose members are authorized to vote. A Christian republic in- evitably must face the question analogous to the one today disturb- ing the state of Israel: Who is a Jew? On this dual point – the question of civil sanctions and ecclesias- tical sanctions — Rushdoony has remained conspicuously silent throughout his career, but his actions in recent years indicate that he sides with the Baptists and Anabaptists in American history: Church membership has nothing to do with voting or holding civil office. This conclusion leads him straight into the pluralistic arms of Roger Williams. There is no permanent halfway house between John Win- throp and Roger Williams. There is no permanent halfway cove- nant. There is no neutrality. Instead, there are Church sacraments.

The sign of this denial is his life-long designa- tion of the U.S. Constitution as an implicitly Christian covenant, meaning a halfway national covenant. That was what the Articles of Confed~ration constituted; the Constitution is apostate. 91. Understand, I mean the sacraments as covenant sealing (baptism) and covenant- renewing (Lord’s Supper).

When he observed that the state recognizes only three kinds of legal bodies — associations, founda- tions, and corporations — he found no category for the church among these. And he wholeheartedly agreed with Kuyper who wrote: That same God who instituted the Government and clothed the Gov- ernment with authority as his servant, that same God has, by virtue of his sovereign omnipotence, brought the Church of Christ into this world and distributed her over all nations and peoples. That Church is not the product of human volition but God’s own creation. C onse- quently the Government is not asked if it wishes to tolerate the Church; she exists jure divino (by divine right). “Excellent ,“ said Hoedemaker. “It could not have been said bet- ter.” But then he wanted Kuyper to go one step further by saying that the state must recognize the fact that God has formed the church. The criterion for determining whether a state is christian is this: do the government and the state’s constitution (if we are dealing with a con- stitutional state) grant a public-legal existence to the church as revel- ation of the Body of Christ? Hoedemaker felt that to deprive the church of its public juridical status would be a denial of Christ by the government. L.

Such decisions should be made prayerfully in the light of Scripture and with the counsel of the church. Acts 5:29; 1 Sam. 14:44-45. 14. When justly administered, capital punishment is a scriptural application of civil authority. Rem. 13:4; Gen. 9:6; Acts 25:11; Num. 35:29-34. 15. The Christian, when such action involves no disloyalty to Christ, ought to be involved in the selection of and to vote for civil rulers who fear God, love truth and justice, hate evil, and are pub- licly committed to scriptural principles of civil government. Ex. 18:21; Deut. 16:18, 2 Sam. 23:3; Rem. 13:3, 16. It is sinful for a Christian to take an oath which compromises his supreme allegiance to Jesus Christ. It is also sinful to vote for offi- cials who are required to take an oath which a Christian himself could not take in good conscience. Voting involves the voter in re- sponsibility for any act required of the official as a condition of hold- ing his office. Deut. 10:20; Isa. 45:22-23; 2 John 1:11; 1 Tim. 5:22. 17. The Christian must profess publically and the Church must witness, that Christ is the Ruler of every nation. Whatever the offi- cial action of the civil government of a nation may be, the Christian in his civil actions must always exhibit his loyalty to Christ. The Christian must relinquish every right or privilege of citizenship which involves him in silence about, or denial of the supreme au- thority of Jesus Christ. Matt. 5:13-14; Prov. 3:5-6; Ps. 37:7; Matt. 22:21; John 17:14-15; Mark 13:9. 18. We reject the portion of paragraph 3 after the colon. 1 1.

Both the government of the nation and the government of the visible church are established by God. Though distinct and inde- pendent of each other, they both owe supreme allegiance to Jesus Christ. The governments of church and state differ in sphere of au- thority in that due submission to the government of the visible church is the obligation of members thereof, while due submission to civil government is the obligation of all men. The governments of church and state also have different functions and prerogatives in the advancement of the Kingdom of God. The means of enforcement of the civil government are physical, while those of church government are not. Neither government has the right to invade or assume the authority of the other. They should cooperate to the honor and glory of God, while maintaining their separate jurisdictions. Rem. 13:1; Matt. 22:21; Col. 1:18; Acts 15:10; Ezra 7:10, 25-26; 2 Chron. 26:18-19; Matt. 5:25; 1 Cor. 5:12-13. 20. Though responsible for maintaining conditions favorable to the spread of the Gospel, civil government should never attempt to convert men to Christ by the use of force or by persecution. It should guarantee to all its subjects every human right given by God to men. It should, however, restrain and punish its subjects for those sinful actions which fall under its jurisdiction. 1 Tim. 2:1-4; 1 Pet. 2:13-14; Rem. 13:4; Ezra 7:26; Neh. 13:17-21. 21. No civil government which deprives men of civil or religious liberty, fails to protect human life, or proposes to force men to do violence to the spirit and precepts of the Christian religion or inter- feres unjustly with private ownership of property, can in such mat- ters rightfully expect the submission of its citizens or the blessings of God promised for obedience to Him. Acts 4:17,19,33; Deut. 27:19; Isa. 10:1-2; Ex. 20:15; Isa. 1:23-26; Dan. 6:13; Heb. 11:23. 22. Both the Christian and the Church have a responsibility for witnessing against national sins and for promoting justice. Amos 2:6-8; Amos 5:14-15. 23. The failure of a civil government, through negligence, ignor- ance, or rebellion, to recognize the authority of Jesus Christ does not"},{"pageNumber":728,"pageContent":"Testimony of the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America 715 cancel its just authority. A civil government, though guilty of many sins, still has authority in so far as it furthers some of the scriptural ends of civil government. Matt. 22:21; Rem. 13:1; Rem. 2:14; Acts 23:5; Ex. 22:28. 24. Due submission of all persons, cheerfully rendered, to civil officers and to civil government in general, is pleasing to God. No person, however, is required by God to obey civil authority when such authority demands that the citizen or subject do that which is clearly contrary to the law of God as revealed in the Scriptures. In such cases the duty of the Christian is to obey God rather than men. The Christian has a special obligation to render due submission to civil authority in order to express his loyalty to Jesus Christ, to prove his concern for the welfare of all men, and to bring honor to the name of Christ. 1 Pet. 2:13-14; Rem. 13:5; Acts 5:29; Titus 3:1. 25. The only submission which a Christian may promise to any civil government is due submission in the Lord. Any promise of sub- mission or oath of allegiance beyond this is sinful. If and when the civil government of a nation requires, as a condition of civil service or of holding office, an oath which implies that civil allegiance transcends the swearer’s convictions of conscience and obedience to God, it is the Christian’s duty to refuse such an oath. It is within the corporate power of the Church, acting through its courts, to declare that facts or circumstances which may exist in a specific situation render the taking of a civil oath sinful. Gen. 25:33; Matt. 22:21; Eph. 6:12; Matt 4:10; Deut. 10:20. 26. It is the duty of the Christian to ascertain whether any prescribed oath of allegiance to the civil authority involves accep- tance of unchristian principles stated or implied in its constitution of government. If the oath of allegiance to civil authority explicitly or by clear implication requires support of anti-Christian, atheistic, or secular principles, then the Christian must refuse on these grounds to take the oath of allegiance. Acts 5:29; Acts 4:18-20."},{"pageNumber":729,"pageContent":"716 POLITICAL POLYTHEISM 27. In the matter of taking oaths required by civil authority, the Christian should seek the guidance and support of the Church. 28. It is the duty of the Christian Church to testify to the author- ity of Christ over the nations, against all anti-Christian, atheistic, and secular principles of civil government, and against all sinful oaths of allegiance to civil governments. When the Church by or- derly processes in her own courts determines that the oath of allegiance to a civil government compromises the Christian’s loyalty to Christ or involves the Christian in the support of sinful principles of civil government, the Church must require her members to refuse such sinful oaths. Acts 4:24-29; Eph. 5:11; Rev. 3:15-16; Acts 15:28-29; Rev. 2:13-14. 29. When participating in political elections, the Christian should support and vote only for such men as are publically committed to scriptural principles of civil government. Should the Christian seek civil office by political election, he must openly inform those whose support he seeks of his adherence to Christian principles of civil gov- ernment. 1 Chron. 16:31; 2 Cor. 6:14-18; 2 Chron. 19:6-7; Dan. 2:48; Eph. 4:25. 30. God alone is Lord of the conscience, and the decisions of civil courts cannot determine for the Christian what is morally right and what is sinful. However, since civil government is an institution of God, it is within the legitimate province of the civil courts of a nation to determine what the nation’s laws and required oaths of allegiance mean or do not mean. A decision of a civil court cannot legitimize sinful conduct, but it can place before a Christian a factual situation upon which a moral judgement can be made. It cannot be proper for the Christian to assume that an oath of allegiance implies sinful re- quirements, when the civil courts have explicitly contradicted such implication. Every oath must be understood in the sense intended by the authority requiring the oath. It is for the Christian and the Church to decide whether this sense involves sinful requirements. Matt. 22:21b; Rom 13:5; Eccl. 8:4; 1 Thess. 5:21. 31. We reject any inference that civil government has jurisdiction over conscience."},{"pageNumber":730,"pageContent":"Our mental image of the religious patriot is distorted because modern accounts do treat the political paragraphs as a series of theoretical expositions of Locke, separated from what precedes and follows. When these orations are read as wholes, they immediately reveal that the sociological sections are structural parts of a rhetori- cal pattern. Embedded in their contexts, these are not abstractions but inherent parts of a theology. It was for this reason that they had so energizing an effect upon their religious auditors. The American situation, as the preachers saw it, was not what Paine presented in Common Sense– a community of hard-working, rational creatures being put upon by an irrational tyrant – but was more like the recur- rent predicament of the chosen people in the Bible. As Samuel Cooper declared on October 25, 1780, upon the inauguration of the Constitution of Massachusetts, America was a new Israel, selected to be “a theatre for the display of some of the most astonishing dis- pensations of his Providence.” The Jews originally were a free repub- lic founded on a covenant over which God “in peculiar favor to that people, was pleased to preside.” When they offended Him, He pun- ished them by destroying their republic, subjecting them to a king. Thus while we today need no revelation to inform us that we are all born free and equal and that sovereignty resides in the people – “these are the plain dictates of that reason and common sense with which the common parent has informed the human bosom” — still Scripture also makes these truths explicit. Once this light is allowed to play on the scene, we perceive the shallowness of that view which would treat the religious appeal as a calculated propaganda maneuver. The ministers did not have to “sell” the Revolution to a public sluggish to “buy.” They were spelling out what both they and the people sincerely believed, nor were the y distracted by worries about the probability that Jefferson held all their constructions to be nonsense. A pure rationalism such as his might have declared the independence of these folk, but it could never have inspired them to fight for it.
