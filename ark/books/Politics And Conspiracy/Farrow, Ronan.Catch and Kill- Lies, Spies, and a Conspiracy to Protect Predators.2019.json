It draws on interviews withmore than two hundred sources, as well as hundreds of pages of contracts,emails, and texts, and dozens of hours of audio. It was subjected to the samestandard of fact-checking as the New Yorker stories on which it is based.All of the dialogue in the book is drawn directly from contemporaneous accountsand records. Because this is a story about surveillance, third parties oftenwitnessed or surreptitiously recorded conversations, and I was sometimes able toobtain their testimonials and records. I adhered to legal and ethical standardswhen creating my own recordings.Most of the sources you will meet in these pages have allowed me to use theirfull names. Some, however, remain unable to do so due to fear of legal reprisalor because of threats to their physical safety. In those instances, the codenames used for the sources during the reporting process have been used here. Ireached out to all of the key figures in Catch and Kill prior to publication, tooffer them an opportunity to respond to any allegations being made about them.If they agreed to speak, the narrative reflects their responses. If they didnot, a good faith effort was made to include existing public statements.

It was late 2016, and cold. The place was done up withtchotchkes from the steppes and ceramic depictions of peasant life: grandmas inbabushkas, farmers with sheep.One of the men was Russian, the other Ukrainian, but this was a distinctionwithout a difference: both were children of the disintegrating Soviet Union.They looked to be in their mid-thirties. Roman Khaykin, the Russian, was shortand thin and bald, with a quarrelsome snub nose and dark eyes. Everything elseabout him was pale: eyebrows barely there, face bloodless, bald scalp slick andshining. He was originally from Kislovodsk, which literally translates to “sourwaters.” His eyes darted around the room, ever suspicious.Igor Ostrovskiy, the Ukrainian, was taller and a little fat. He had curly hairthat got unruly when he let it grow. He and his family had fled to the UnitedStates in the early nineties. Like Khaykin, he was always looking for an angle.He was also curious, meddlesome. During high school, he’d suspected that severalclassmates were selling stolen credit card numbers, probed until he proved it,then helped law enforcement disrupt the operation.Khaykin and Ostrovskiy spoke in accented English enlivened with nativeidioms—“Krasavchik!” Khaykin would say, a word derived from “handsome” but inpractice serving as praise for talent or a job well done. Both men were in thebusiness of subterfuge and surveillance. When Ostrovskiy had found himselfbetween private investigation jobs in 2011, he’d googled “Russian privateinvestigators” and emailed Khaykin cold to ask for work. Khaykin had likedOstrovskiy’s chutzpah and started hiring him for surveillance jobs. Then they’dargued about Khaykin’s methods and drifted apart.As plates of kebab arrived, Khaykin explained how far he’d been pushing theenvelope since they’d last worked together. A new and shadowy client had comeinto the picture, an enterprise he wouldn’t name that was utilizing him as asubcontractor. He was doing big business. “I’m into some cool shit,” he said.“Some dark stuff.” He’d adopted some new methods, too. He could get bank recordsand unauthorized credit reports. He had ways of obtaining a phone’s geolocationdata to track unsuspecting targets. He described how much the phone hijinkscost: a few thousand dollars for the usual approach to the problem, with cheaperoptions for gullible marks and more expensive ones for those who proved elusive.Khaykin said he’d already used the tactic successfully, in a case where onefamily member had hired him to find another.Ostrovskiy figured Khaykin was full of shit. But Ostrovskiy needed the work. AndKhaykin, it turned out, needed more manpower to serve his mysterious new patron.Before parting ways, Ostrovskiy asked about the phone tracking again. “Isn’tthat illegal?” he wondered.“Ehhhh,” said Khaykin.On a tiled wall nearby, a blue-and-white evil eye hung on a string, watching."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Art_P1.jpg]toc.xhtml#toc-part001"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter001]TAPE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter001]“What do you mean it’s not airing tomorrow?” My words drifted over the emptyingnewsroom on the fourth floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, inside the Comcastbuilding, which had once been the GE building, which had once been the RCAbuilding. On the other end of the line, Rich McHugh, my producer at NBC News,was talking over what sounded like the bombing of Dresden but was in fact thenatural soundscape of a household with two sets of young twins. “They justcalled, they’re—no, Izzy, you have to share—Jackie, please don’t biteher—Daddy’s on the phone—”“But it’s the strongest story in the series,” I said. “Maybe not the best TV,but the best underlying story—”“They say we’ve gotta move it. It’s fakakt,” he said, missing the last syllable.(McHugh had this habit of trying out Yiddish words. It never went well.)Airing a series of back-to-back investigative spots like the one McHugh and Iwere about to launch required choreography. Each of the stories was long,consuming days in the network’s edit rooms. Rescheduling one was a big deal.“Move it to when?” I asked.On the other end of the line, there was a muffled crash and several successiveshrieks of laughter. “I gotta call you back,” he said.McHugh was a TV veteran who had worked at Fox and MSNBC and, for the better partof a decade, Good Morning America. He was barrel-chested, with ginger hair and aruddy complexion, and wore a lot of gingham work shirts. He had a plainspoken,laconic quality that cut through the passive-aggressive patter of corporatebureaucracy. “He looks like a farmer,” the investigative unit boss who had firstput us together the previous year had said. “For that matter, he talks like afarmer. You two make no sense together.”“Why the assignment, then?” I’d asked.“You’ll be good for one another,” he’d replied, with a shrug.McHugh had seemed skeptical. I didn’t love talking about my family background,but most people were familiar with it: my mother, Mia Farrow, was an actress; myfather, Woody Allen, a director. My childhood had been plastered across thetabloids after he was accused of sexual assault by my seven-year-old sister,Dylan, and began a sexual relationship with another one of my sisters, Soon-Yi,eventually marrying her. There had been a few headlines again when I startedcollege at an unusually young age and when I headed off to Afghanistan andPakistan as a junior State Department official. In 2013, I’d started a four-yeardeal with NBCUniversal, anchoring a midday show on its cable news channel,MSNBC, for the first year of it. I’d dreamed of making the show serious andfact-driven, and by the end, was proud of how I’d used the inauspicious timeslot for taped investigative stories. The show got some bad reviews at thestart, good reviews at the end, and few viewers throughout. Its cancellation waslittle-noticed; for years after, chipper acquaintances would bound up at partiesand tell me that they loved the show and still watched it every day. “That’s sonice of you to say,” I’d tell them.I’d moved over to the network to work as an investigative correspondent. As faras Rich McHugh was concerned, I was a young lightweight with a famous name,looking for something to do because my contract lasted longer than my TV show.This is where I should say the skepticism was mutual, but I just want everyoneto like me.Working with a producer on the road meant a lot of time together on flights andin rental cars. On our first few shoots together, the silence would yawn betweenus as highway guardrails flashed by, or I’d fill it with too much talk aboutmyself, eliciting the occasional grunt.But the pairing was starting to yield strong stories for my Today showinvestigative series and for Nightly News, as well as a reluctant mutualrespect. McHugh was as smart as anyone I’d met in the news business and a sharpeditor of scripts. And we both loved a tough story.After McHugh’s call, I looked at the cable headlines on one of the newsroom’stelevisions, then texted him: “They’re scared of sexual assault?” The story wewere being asked to reschedule was about colleges botching sexual assaultinvestigations on campus. We’d talked to both victims and alleged perpetrators,who were sometimes in tears, and sometimes had their faces obscured in shadow.It was the sort of report that, in the 8:00 a.m. time slot for which it wasdestined, would require Matt Lauer to furrow his brow, express earnest concern,and then transition to a segment about celebrity skin care.McHugh wrote back: “Yes. All Trump and then sex assault.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]It was a Sunday evening in early October 2016. The preceding Friday, theWashington Post had published an article demurely titled “Trump Recorded HavingExtremely Lewd Conversation About Women in 2005.” There was a video accompanyingthe article, the kind you used to call “not safe for work.” In a soliloquycaptured by the celebrity news program Access Hollywood, Donald Trump held forthabout grabbing women “by the pussy.” “I did try and fuck her. She was married,”he had said. “She’s now got the big phony tits and everything.”Trump’s interlocutor had been Billy Bush, the host of Access Hollywood. Bush wasa small man with good hair. You could place him near any celebrity and he wouldproduce a steady stream of forgettable but occasionally weird red-carpet banter.“How do you feel about your butt?” he once asked Jennifer Lopez. And when she,visibly uncomfortable, replied, “Are you kidding me? You did not just ask methat,” he said brightly, “I did!”And so, as Trump described his exploits, Bush chirped and snickered in assent.“Yes! The Donald has scored!”Access Hollywood was an NBCUniversal property. After the Washington Post brokethe story that Friday, NBC platforms raced their own versions on air. WhenAccess broadcast the tape, it excised some of Bush’s more piquant remarks. Somecritics asked when NBC executives became aware of the tape and whether theydeliberately sat on it. Leaked accounts presented differing timelines. On“background” calls to reporters, some NBC executives said the story just hadn’tbeen ready, that it had required further legal review. (Of one such call, aWashington Post writer observed tartly: “The executive was unaware of anyspecific legal issue raised by airing an eleven-year-old recording of apresidential candidate who was apparently aware at the time that he was beingrecorded by a TV program.”) Two NBCUniversal lawyers, Kim Harris and SusanWeiner, had reviewed the tape and signed off on its release, but NBC hadhesitated, and lost one of the most important election stories in a generation.There was another problem: the Today show had just brought Billy Bush into itscast of hosts. Not two months earlier, they’d aired a “Get to Know Billy” video,complete with footage of him getting his chest hair waxed on air.McHugh and I had been editing and legally vetting our series for weeks. But thetrouble was apparent the moment I began promoting the series on social media.“Come to watch the #BillyBush apology, stay to watch #RonanFarrow explain to himwhy an apology is necessary,” one viewer tweeted.“Of course they moved sexual assault,” I texted McHugh an hour later. “BillyBush must be apologizing for the pussy grab convo right within spitting distanceof our airtime.”Billy Bush did not apologize that day. As I waited in the wings at Studio 1A thenext morning, looking over my script, Savannah Guthrie announced: “Pendingfurther review of the matter, NBC News has suspended Billy Bush, the host ofToday’s third hour, for his role in that conversation with Donald Trump.” Andthen it was onward and upward to cooking, and more caffeinated laughter—and mystory on Adderall abuse on college campuses, which had been rushed in to replacethe one about sexual assault.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The years before the release of the Access Hollywood tape had seen thereemergence of sexual assault allegations against the comedian Bill Cosby. InJuly of 2016, the former Fox News personality Gretchen Carlson had filed asexual harassment suit against the head of that network, Roger Ailes. Soon afterthe tape was released, women in at least fifteen cities staged sit-ins andmarches at Trump buildings, chanting about emancipation, carrying signs withreappropriated “pussy” imagery: cats, howling or arching, emblazoned with “PUSSYGRABS BACK.” Four women publicly claimed that Trump had groped or kissed themwithout consent in much the fashion he’d described as routine to Billy Bush. TheTrump campaign denounced them as fabulists. A hashtag, popularized by thecommentator Liz Plank, solicited explanations of why #WomenDontReport. “A(female) criminal attorney said because I’d done a sex scene in a film I wouldnever win against the studio head,” the actress Rose McGowan tweeted. “Becauseit’s been an open secret in Hollywood/Media & they shamed me while adulating myrapist,” she added. “It is time for some goddamned honesty in this world.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter002]BITE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter002]Since the establishment of the first studios, few movie executives had been asdominant, or as domineering, as the one to whom McGowan was referring. HarveyWeinstein cofounded the production-and-distribution companies Miramax and theWeinstein Company, helping to reinvent the model for independent films withmovies like Sex, Lies, and Videotape; Pulp Fiction; and Shakespeare in Love. Hismovies had earned more than three hundred Oscar nominations, and at the annualawards ceremonies he had been thanked more than almost anyone else in moviehistory, ranking just below Steven Spielberg and several places above God. Attimes, even this seemed a fine distinction: Meryl Streep had once jokinglyreferred to Weinstein as God.Weinstein was six feet tall and big. His face was lopsided, one small eye in ahabitual squint. He often wore oversize tee shirts over drooping jeans that gavehim a billowing profile. The son of a diamond cutter, Weinstein was raised inQueens. As a teenager he and his younger brother, Bob, had snuck off to see The400 Blows at an arthouse theater, hoping it was a “sex movie.” Instead, theystumbled into François Truffaut and a burgeoning love of highbrow cinema.Weinstein enrolled at the State University of New York at Buffalo partly becausethe city had multiple movie theaters. When he was eighteen, he and a friendnamed Corky Burger produced a column for the student newspaper, the Spectrum,featuring a character they called “Denny the Hustler,” who menaced women intosubmission. “‘Denny the Hustler’ did not take no for an answer,” the columnread. “His whole approach employs a psychology of command, or in layman’sterms—‘Look, baby, I’m probably the best-looking and most exciting person you’llever want to meet—and if you refuse to dance with me, I’ll probably crack thisbottle of Schmidt’s over your skull.’”Weinstein dropped out of college to start a business with his brother, Bob, andBurger, at first under the banner of Harvey and Corky Productions, whichspecialized in concert promotion. But at a Buffalo theater he acquired,Weinstein also screened the independent and foreign films he’d come to love.Eventually, he and Bob Weinstein started Miramax, named after their parents,Miriam and Max, and began acquiring small foreign films. Weinstein turned out tohave a flair for making the movies into events. They received awards, like thesurprise Palme d’Or win at Cannes for Sex, Lies, and Videotape. In the earlynineties, Disney acquired Miramax. Weinstein spent a decade as the goose thatlaid egg after golden egg. And in the 2000s, when the relationship with Disneyfaltered and the brothers started a new enterprise, the Weinstein Company, theyquickly raised hundreds of millions of dollars in funding. Weinstein hadn’tquite recaptured his glory days, but did win back-to-back Best Picture Oscarsfor The King’s Speech in 2010 and The Artist in 2011. Over the course of hisascent, he married his assistant, got a divorce, and later wed an aspiringactress he’d begun casting in small roles.Weinstein was famous for his bullying, even threatening, style of doingbusiness. He was deimatic, capable of expanding to frighten, like a blowfishinflating itself. He’d draw up to rivals or underlings, nose-to-nose, red-faced.“I was sitting at my desk one day and thought we were hit by an earthquake,”Donna Gigliotti, who shared an Oscar with Weinstein for producing Shakespeare inLove, once told a reporter. “The wall just shook. I stood up. I learned that hehad flung a marble ashtray at the wall.” And then there were stories, mostlywhispers, of a darker kind of violence against women, and of efforts to keep hisvictims quiet. Every few years, a reporter, alerted to the rumors, would sniffaround, to see if the smoke might lead to fire.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]For Weinstein, the months before the 2016 presidential election looked likebusiness as usual. There he was, at a cocktail party for William J. Bratton, theformer New York City police commissioner. There he was, laughing with Jay-Z,announcing a film and television deal with the rapper. And there he was,deepening his long-standing ties to the Democratic Party politicians for whom hehad long been a major fund-raiser.All year, he’d been part of the brain trust around Hillary Clinton. “I’mprobably telling you what you know already, but that needs to be silenced,” heemailed Clinton’s staff, about messaging from Bernie Sanders’s competingcampaign to Latino and African American voters. “This article gives youeverything I discussed with you yesterday,” he said in another message, sendinga column critical of Sanders and pressing for negative campaigning. “About toforward some creative. Took your idea and ran,” Clinton’s campaign managerresponded. By the end of the year, Weinstein had raised hundreds of thousands ofdollars for Clinton.A few days after McGowan’s tweets that October, Weinstein was at the St. JamesTheatre in New York City for a lavish fund-raiser he’d co-produced for Clinton,which put a further $2 million in her campaign’s coffers. The musician SaraBareilles sat bathed in purple light and sang: “your history of silence won’t doyou any good / Did you think it would? / Let your words be anything but empty /Why don’t you tell them the truth?”—which seems too on the nose to be true, butthat’s what happened.Weinstein’s influence had dwindled somewhat in the preceding years, but it wasstill sufficient to sustain public embrace from the elites. As the latest awardsseason kicked off that fall, a Hollywood Reporter movie critic, StephenGalloway, ran an article headlined “Harvey Weinstein, the Comeback Kid,” withthe subhead, “There are a lot of reasons to root for him, especially now.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Around the same time, Weinstein sent an email to his lawyers, including DavidBoies, the high-profile attorney who had represented Al Gore in the 2000presidential election dispute and argued for marriage equality before the U.S.Supreme Court. Boies had represented Weinstein for years. He was in his lateseventies by then, still trim, with a face that had creased, with age, intosomething kind and approachable. “The Black Cube Group from Israel contacted methrough Ehud Barak,” Weinstein wrote. “They r strategists and say your firm haveused them. Gmail me when u get a chance.”Barak was the former prime minister of Israel and chief of the General Staff ofthe Israeli military. Black Cube, the enterprise he’d recommended to Weinstein,was run largely by former officers of Mossad and other Israeli intelligenceagencies. It had branches in Tel Aviv, London, and Paris, and offered itsclients the skills of operatives “highly experienced and trained in Israel’selite military and governmental intelligence units,” according to itsliterature.Later that month, Boies’s firm and Black Cube signed a confidential contract,and Boies’s colleagues wired 100,000 U.S. dollars for an initial period of work.In the documents around the assignment, Weinstein’s identity was oftenconcealed. He was referred to as “the end client” or “Mr. X.” Naming Weinstein,an operative from Black Cube wrote, “will make him extremely angry.”Weinstein seemed excited about the work. During a meeting in late November, hepressed Black Cube to keep going. More money was wired, and the agency put inmotion aggressive operations referred to as “Phase 2A” and “Phase 2B.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Soon after, a reporter named Ben Wallace got a call from a number he didn’trecognize, with a UK country code. Wallace was in his late forties, and worenarrow, professorial glasses. He had published, a few years earlier, TheBillionaire’s Vinegar, a history of the world’s most expensive bottle of wine.More recently, he’d been writing for New York magazine, where he’d spent thepreceding weeks talking to people about the rumors swirling around Weinstein.“You can call me Anna,” said the voice on the other end of the line, in arefined European accent. After graduating from college, Wallace had lived in theCzech Republic and Hungary for a few years. He had a good ear for accents, buthe couldn’t quite place this one. He guessed she might be German.“I received your number through a friend,” the woman continued, explaining thatshe knew he was working on a story about the entertainment industry. Wallacetried to think of what friend could have made such an introduction. Not manypeople knew about his assignment.“I might have something that might be of importance for you,” she continued.When Wallace pressed her for more information, she was coy. The information shehad was sensitive, she said. She needed to see him. He hesitated for a moment.Then he thought, What’s the harm? He was looking for a break in the story. Maybeshe’d be it.The following Monday morning, Wallace sat in a coffee shop in SoHo and tried toget a read on the mystery woman. She looked to be in her mid-thirties, with longblond hair, dark eyes, high cheekbones, and a Roman nose. She wore ConverseChucks and gold jewelry. Anna said she wasn’t comfortable giving her real nameyet. Frightened, she was grappling with whether to come forward. Wallace hadbeen picking up on this theme in his exchanges with other sources. He told hershe could take her time.For their next meeting, not long after, she chose a hotel bar in the sameneighborhood. When Wallace arrived, she smiled at him invitingly, evenseductively. She had already ordered a glass of wine. “I won’t bite,” she said,patting the seat next to her. “Come sit next to me.” Wallace said he had a coldand ordered tea. If they were going to work together, he told her, he needed toknow more. At this, Anna broke down, her face twisting in anguish. She seemed tohold back tears as she began to describe her experiences with Weinstein. Thatshe’d gone through something intimate and upsetting was clear, but she was cageyabout details. She wanted to learn more before she answered all of Wallace’squestions. She asked what had motivated him to take on the assignment and whatkind of impact he sought. As he replied, Anna leaned in, conspicuously extendingher wrist toward him.For Wallace, working on the story was becoming a strange, charged experience.There was a level of noise, of keen outside interest, to which he wasunaccustomed. He was hearing from other journalists, even: Seth Freedman, anEnglishman who’d written for the Guardian, got in touch soon after, suggestinghe’d heard the rumors about what Wallace was working on and wanted to help."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter003]DIRT [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter003]In the first week of November 2016, just before the election, Dylan Howard,editor in chief of the National Enquirer, issued an unusual order to a member ofhis staff. “I need to get everything out of the safe,” he said. “And then weneed to get a shredder down there.” Howard was from southeastern Australia. Hehad a troll-doll tuft of ginger hair over a round face, and wore Coke-bottleglasses and loud ties. That day, he appeared to be in a panic. The Wall StreetJournal had just called the Enquirer for comment about a story involving Howardand David Pecker, the CEO of the Enquirer’s parent company, American Media Inc.The story alleged that AMI had taken on a sensitive assignment at Donald Trump’sbehest, chasing a lead with the objective not of publishing it, but of making itgo away.The staffer opened the safe, removed a set of documents, and tried to wrest itshut. Later, reporters would discuss the safe like it was the warehouse wherethey stored the Ark of the Covenant in Indiana Jones, but it was small and cheapand old. It sat in an office that had belonged, for years, to the magazine’sveteran executive editor, Barry Levine. It had a tendency to get jammed.It took several tries and a FaceTime video call to the staffer’s significantother for advice to get the safe properly closed. Later that day, one employeesaid, a disposal crew collected and carried away a larger than customary volumeof refuse. A Trump-related document from the safe, along with others in theEnquirer’s possession, had been shredded.In June 2016, Howard had compiled a list of the dirt about Trump accumulated inAMI’s archives, dating back decades. After the election, Trump’s lawyer MichaelCohen requested all the tabloid empire’s materials about the new president.There was an internal debate: some were starting to realize that surrendering itall would create a legally problematic paper trail, and resisted. Nevertheless,Howard and senior staff ordered the reporting material that wasn’t already inthe small safe exhumed from storage bins in Florida and sent to AMIheadquarters. When the reporting material arrived, it was placed first in thelittle safe and then, as the political temperature around the magazine’srelationship with the president turned white-hot, in a bigger one in the officeof human resources head Daniel Rotstein. (The HR offices of the Enquirer’sparent company, one person familiar with the company cracked with mock surprise,were not, in fact, in a strip bar.) It was only later, when one of the employeeswho had been skeptical started getting jumpy and went to check, that they foundsomething amiss: the list of Trump dirt didn’t match up with the physical files.Some of the material had gone missing. Howard began swearing to colleagues thatnothing had ever been destroyed, an assertion he maintains to this day.In one sense, destroying documents would be consistent with a baseline ofmalfeasance that had, for years, defined the Enquirer and its parent company.“We are always at the edge of what’s legally permissible,” a senior AMI staffertold me. “It’s very exciting.” Illicitly obtaining medical records was onestandard maneuver. At major hospitals, the Enquirer cultivated moles. One suchmole, who had spirited the records of Britney Spears, Farrah Fawcett, and othersout of UCLA Medical Center, ultimately pleaded guilty to a felony charge.AMI routinely engaged in what employee after employee called“blackmail”—withholding the publication of damaging information in exchange fortips or exclusives. And the employees whispered about an even darker side ofAMI’s operations, including a network of subcontractors who were sometimes paidthrough creative channels to avoid scrutiny, and who sometimes relied on tacticsthat were hands-on and intrusive.In another sense, however, something new seemed to be happening in AMI’s officesin Manhattan’s Financial District. Pecker had known Donald Trump for decades.When a reporter said to Pecker, after the election, that criticism of Trump wasnot synonymous with criticism of AMI, he’d replied, “To me it is. The guy’s apersonal friend of mine.” Over the years, the two had enjoyed an alliance, totheir mutual benefit. Pecker, a graying former accountant from the Bronx with abroad mustache, got proximity to power and Trump’s many perquisites. “Pecker gotto fly on his private jet,” said Maxine Page, who worked at AMI on and off from2002 to 2012, including as an executive editor at one of the company’s websites.Howard, too, enjoyed Trump’s favors. On the eve of the 2017 inauguration, hesent excited texts to friends and colleagues, with pictures of his access to thefestivities.The fruit of the relationship, for Trump, was more consequential. Another formereditor, Jerry George, estimated that Pecker killed perhaps ten fully reportedstories about Trump, and nixed many more potential leads during George’stwenty-eight years at the Enquirer.As Trump mounted his run for office, the alliance appeared to deepen and change.Suddenly, the Enquirer was formally endorsing Trump, and it and other AMIoutlets were blaring sycophantic headlines. “DON’T MESS WITH DONALD TRUMP!” oneissue of the Globe declared. “HOW TRUMP WILL WIN!” added the Enquirer. When theEnquirer tallied the “Twisted Secrets of the Candidates!,” the tabloid’srevelation about Trump was: “he has greater support and popularity than evenhe’s admitted to!” Screaming covers about Hillary Clinton’s supposed treacheryand flagging health became a mainstay. “‘SOCIOPATH’ HILLARY CLINTON’S SECRETPSYCH FILES EXPOSED!” they howled, and “HILLARY: CORRUPT! RACIST! CRIMINAL!” Theexclamation points made the headlines look like budget musical titles. Afavorite subplot was Clinton’s impending death. (She miraculously defied thetabloid’s prognoses and kept right on almost-dying all the way through theelection.) Not long before voters went to the polls, Howard had colleagues pulla stack of the covers for Pecker to present to Trump.During the campaign, Trump associates, including Michael Cohen, called Peckerand Howard. A series of covers about Trump’s competitor in the Republicanprimary, Ted Cruz, which chronicled a wild conspiracy theory about Cruz’s fatherbeing linked to the assassination of JFK, were planted by another Trumpassociate, the political consultant Roger Stone. Howard even made contact withAlex Jones, a maniacal radio personality whose conspiracy theories had helpedlift Trump’s candidacy, and later appeared on Jones’s show. And sometimes, AMIstaffers were told not merely to kill unflattering leads about the magazine’sfavored candidate but to seek out information and lock it up tight in thecompany’s vaults. “This is fucking nonsense,” one of them later told me. “Theoperation became like Pravda.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The pact with Trump wasn’t the only alliance Howard and Pecker nurtured. In2015, AMI had struck a production deal with Harvey Weinstein. Nominally, thedeal empowered AMI, amid declining circulation numbers, to spin off its RadarOnline website into a television show. But the relationship had anotherdimension. That year, Howard and Weinstein drew close. When a model went to thepolice with a claim that Weinstein had groped her, Howard told his staff to stopreporting on the matter—and then, later, explored buying the rights to themodel’s story, in exchange for her signing a nondisclosure agreement. When theactress Ashley Judd claimed a studio head had sexually harassed her, almost butnot quite identifying Weinstein, AMI reporters were asked to pursue negativeitems about her going to rehab. After McGowan’s claim surfaced, one colleague ofHoward’s remembered him saying, “I want dirt on that bitch.”In late 2016, the relationship deepened. In one email, Howard proudly forwardedto Weinstein the latest handiwork of one of AMI’s subcontractors: a secretrecording of a woman whom the subcontractor had enticed to make statementsdamaging to McGowan. “I have something AMAZING,” Howard wrote. The woman had“laid into Rose pretty hard.”“This is the killer,” Weinstein replied. “Especially if my fingerprints r not onthis.”“They are not,” Howard wrote. “And the conversation—between you and I—isRECORDED.” In another email, Howard sent a list of other contacts to be targetedin a similar manner. “Let’s discuss next steps on each,” he wrote.The National Enquirer was a tabloid sewer, a place to which much of America’sugly gossip eventually flowed. When stories were abandoned or successfullyburied at the behest of AMI’s friends in high places, they came to rest in theEnquirer’s archives, in what some staff called “kill files.” As hiscollaboration with Weinstein deepened, Howard had been scrutinizing thishistorical repository. One day that fall, colleagues recalled, he requested thata specific file be pulled, related to an anchor at a TV network."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter004]BUTTON [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter004]Matt Lauer sat with his legs crossed just so: right knee over left, with aslight lean forward, allowing his right hand to grip the top of the same shin.Even in casual conversation, he looked as if he might effortlessly throw to acommercial break. When I tried to emulate Lauer’s relaxed-yet-composed seatingposition on air, I just looked like someone new to yoga.It was December 2016. We were in Lauer’s office on the third floor of 30Rockefeller Plaza. He sat behind his glass-topped desk. I was on the couchopposite. On shelves and credenzas, Emmys loomed. Lauer had worked his way upfrom local television in West Virginia to his current position as one of themost prominent and popular figures in network television. NBC paid him in excessof $20 million a year and ferried him by helicopter to and from his house in theHamptons.“It’s really good stuff,” Lauer was saying, of the most recent story in myinvestigative series. He had his hair buzzed close, which suited him, and tuftysalt-and-pepper facial hair, which suited him less. “That leaking nuclear plant,where was it—”“Washington State,” I said.“Washington State. That’s right. And that government guy sweating bullets.” Heshook his head, chuckled.The story was about the Hanford nuclear facility, where the United Statesgovernment had buried several Olympic swimming pools’ worth of nuclear wasteleft over from the Manhattan Project. Workers were getting sprayed with thatwaste with alarming frequency.“That’s what we need more of on the show,” he said. We’d talked a lot about hisbelief in serious investigative reporting. “Plays well on set. And it rates,” hecontinued. “What have you got coming up?”I glanced at the sheaf of papers I’d brought with me. “There’s one on Dow andShell seeding California farmlands with toxic chemicals.” Lauer noddedappreciatively, sliding on horn-rimmed glasses and turning to his monitor.Emails scrolled by, reflected in the lenses. “There’s a series on addiction, oneon truck safety reforms being blocked by lobbyists,” I continued. “And one aboutsexual harassment in Hollywood.”His eyes snapped back to me. I wasn’t sure which story had caught his attention.“It’s for a series about undercovered stories in Hollywood,” I said.“Pedophilia, racism, harassment…”Lauer was wearing a neatly tailored suit with a gray windowpane motif and astriped navy tie. He smoothed it down and shifted his attention back to me.“They sound terrific.” He was eyeing me appraisingly. “Where do you see yourselfin a few years?” he asked.It had been nearly two years since MSNBC euthanized my cable program. “RonanFarrow Goes from Anchor’s Desk to Cubicle,” a recent Page Six headline hadoffered. Turns out, my desk was in the background shot of MSNBC’s daytime newscoverage. There I was, typing behind Tamron Hall and on the phone behind AliVelshi. I was proud of the work I was doing for Today. But I was struggling tofind a niche. I considered everything, even radio. That fall, I met with SiriusXM Satellite Radio. Melissa Lonner, a vice president there, had departed Today afew years earlier. Trying to sound bullish, I told her that I figured Todaywould be a better platform for investigative reporting than cable anyway. “Yes,”Lonner said, with a tight smile. “I loved it there.” But the truth was, myfuture felt uncertain, and it meant a lot to me that Lauer was giving me thistime.I thought about his question about the future and said, “I’d like to get back toanchoring at some point.”“I know, I know,” he said. “That’s what you think you want.” I opened my mouth.He cut me off. “You’re searching for something.” He slid his glasses off,inspected them. “Maybe you’ll find it. But you’re going to have to figure outyourself. What you really care about.” He smiled. “You excited for next week?”I was scheduled to fill in when he and the other anchors departed for theChristmas holiday.“I am!” I said.“Remember, you’re the new guy on set. Interaction is everything. Write yourOrange Room tags with bait for conversation.” The Orange Room was the part ofToday where we aired slideshows of Facebook posts, for some reason. “Personalizethe scripts. If it were me, you’d mention my kids. You get the idea.” Iscribbled a few notes, thanked him, and began to leave.As I reached the door, he said wryly, “Don’t let us down. I’ll be watching.”“You want this closed?” I asked.“I’ve got it,” he said. He pushed a button on his desk. The door swung shut.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Not long after, I sent a copy of The Teenage Brain: A Neuroscientist’s SurvivalGuide to Raising Adolescents and Young Adults to Lauer’s house in the Hamptons.On air, I followed his advice in earnest. I stood in the Today show plaza andspread holiday cheer, breath clouding in front of me. I sat on the semicircularcouch in Studio 1A with the other pinch hitters for intros and outros, andgripped my shin, and looked not much like Matt Lauer at all.One morning, we closed out the show with a reel of outtakes and bloopers fromthe preceding year. We’d all seen the video: when we’d aired it once before, andthen again at the show’s nondenominational holiday party. When the tape began toplay and the studio lights dimmed, most of the team wandered off or checkedtheir phones. There was just one senior Today employee who remained in front ofthe monitor, transfixed. She was one of the hardest-working people I’dencountered in television. She’d worked her way up from local news to her rolethat day.“I don’t envy you,” I said. “Having to watch this over and over.”“No,” she said, still fixed on the screen. “I love this. This was my dream job.”I was startled to see tears in her eyes.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]A few weeks after my conversation with Matt Lauer, around the corner in the NBCNews executive suite, I sat opposite the executive in charge of the Today show,Noah Oppenheim. That day, the views of Rockefeller Plaza from his corner officewere obscured by fog and drizzle. I was flanked by McHugh and Jackie Levin, thesenior producer overseeing our next investigative miniseries, the one I’d toldLauer about, on Hollywood. “So, what have you got?” asked Oppenheim, leaningback on a couch, and I prepared to give him an update.Oppenheim, like Lauer, supported hard news. When he was tapped to run Today,he’d come to see me before he even had a desk, and told me to deal with onlyhim, not the other executives at the show. He’d put me on the Today show morefrequently and greenlit my increasingly ambitious investigations. When RonanFarrow Daily became Ronan Farrow Rarely, it was Oppenheim who arranged to haveme stay at the network and continue my Today show series. Oppenheim was in hislate thirties, with affable, boyish features and body language that seemedforever in a slouch, waiting for you to lean in before he did. He had a qualityI lacked and envied, which was this: he was insouciant, laid-back, cool. He wasa doe-eyed stoner whose mellow seemed impossible to harsh. We’d laughed abouthis stories of getting high and ordering entire Thai delivery menus and we’dplanned to spend a night in with edibles at some point.Oppenheim was smart, with an Ivy League pedigree. Early in the 2000 presidentialcampaign, MSNBC personality Chris Matthews and his executive producer, PhilGriffin, who would go on to run that cable channel, encountered a snowstormduring a commute from New Hampshire back to New York and stopped off at Harvard.That night, Griffin and a colleague found Oppenheim, a senior who wrote for theHarvard Crimson, drunk in a corner. They ended up offering to put him on TV.“They stopped off at Harvard Square and started talking to some undergraduategirls at a bar,” Oppenheim later told a reporter. “They followed them to alate-night party at the newspaper building and one picked up a copy of the paperand read an article I’d written about the presidential race.”That chance encounter with Oppenheim eventually led him from conservativepunditry to producing on MSNBC, and then to a senior producer role on Today. Buthe always had wider ambitions. He co-authored a series of self-help books calledThe Intellectual Devotional (“Impress your friends by explaining Plato’s Caveallegory, pepper your cocktail party conversation with opera terms,” read thejacket copy) and boasted that Steven Spielberg had given them out as holidaygifts, “so now I can die happy.” In 2008, he left the network and moved hisfamily to Santa Monica to pursue a career in Hollywood. Referring to journalism,he said, “I had an amazing experience through my 20s doing that but had alwaysloved the movie business, and movies, and drama.” He worked briefly for themedia heiress Elisabeth Murdoch’s reality television empire, then transitionedto screenwriting. “I did that,” he said of reality TV, “then got antsy becauseit still wasn’t getting me to my real love: scripted drama.”Oppenheim had enjoyed a charmed ascent in each of his careers. He sent his firstscreenplay, Jackie, a morose biopic about the days between Kennedy’sassassination and funeral, to a studio executive who had been a friend atHarvard. “Less than a week later, I find myself sitting with Steven Spielberg inhis office on the Universal lot,” he later recalled. The movie, which featured alot of dialogue-free long shots of the woman in question pacing around withtear-streaked mascara, had been embraced by critics and, I was finding, less soby the public. “What was that movie he did again?” McHugh had said as we walkedover to the meeting.“Jackie.”“Oof.”Oppenheim had also co-written an adaptation of the young adult postapocalypticadventure The Maze Runner, which made money, and a sequel to the Divergentseries, which did not.The years between Oppenheim’s departure from Rockefeller Plaza and his returnhad been challenging for Today. The anchor Ann Curry, beloved by audiences andnot beloved by Matt Lauer, had been fired. Ratings slipped behind thecompetition, the more caffeinated Good Morning America. The stakes for NBC werehigh: Today was worth half a billion dollars in advertising revenue a year. In2015, NBC brought Oppenheim back to Today to perform a rescue operation.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]In June 2016, I’d gotten a green light from Oppenheim on a series I had dubbed,in the exaggerated manner of morning television, The Dark Side of Hollywood?,but getting support on specific topics had presented some difficulty. Theearliest pitch I sent to the brass focused on allegations of sexual misconductwith minors, including the ones ultimately reported in the Atlantic aboutdirector Bryan Singer, which he has long denied, as well as claims aboutpedophilia raised by the actor Corey Feldman. An interview with Feldman had beensecured: Today’s head of booking, Matt Zimmerman, had cut a deal whereby theformer child star would perform a song and stay on to answer my questions. ButZimmerman had later called to say Oppenheim considered the pedophilia angle “toodark,” and we’d scrapped the plan.The stories I proposed as replacements presented their own obstacles. Levin, thesenior producer, told McHugh and me that a story about celebrities performingfor dictators, referencing Jennifer Lopez’s seven-figure gig for GurbangulyBerdymukhamedov, totalitarian leader of Turkmenistan, was a nonstarter in lightof the network’s relationship with Lopez. No one seemed to even want toacknowledge a story I proposed about racial discrimination in Hollywood.Oppenheim finally said, with a chuckle, “Look, I’m ‘woke’ or whatever, I justdon’t think our viewers want to see Will Smith complain about how hard he hasit.”Network television is a commercial medium. Conversations about the palatabilityof stories are commonplace. You pick your battles, and none of these werebattles worth picking. We’d set aside the Hollywood series for a few months,reviving it late in the year, with an eye toward airing it around Oscar seasonearly the next year.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]As we sat in Oppenheim’s office that January, we mulled more potential topics,including a pitch about plastic surgery. Then I returned to one of my proposalsthat seemed to have withstood the development conversations so far: a storyabout the Hollywood “casting couch”—performers being harassed or propositionedfor transactional sex at work. “We’ve been making steady progress,” I said. I’dalready begun talking to a few actresses who claimed to have stories.“You should look at Rose McGowan, she tweeted something about a studio head,”Oppenheim said.“I hadn’t seen that,” I replied. I pulled out my phone and loaded a Varietyarticle. The actress’s tweets slid by under my thumb. “Maybe she’ll talk,” Isaid. “I’ll look into it.”Oppenheim shrugged hopefully."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter005]KANDAHAR [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter005]A few days later, Harvey Weinstein was in Los Angeles, meeting with operativesfrom Black Cube. The operatives reported that they had been making headway,encircling agreed-upon targets. Weinstein’s lawyers had quickly covered the lastpayment, for Phase 2A, but they had been sitting on an invoice for Phase 2B formore than a month. It took several tense exchanges before another payment wasdelivered and the next, more intense, riskier stage of the operation began.Our reporting at NBC was growing more intense, too. Over the course of January,the Hollywood series took shape. I had begun to report out a story on riggedawards campaigns, along with one about sexist hiring practices behind the cameraand another about Chinese influence on American blockbusters. (The adversariesin Red Dawn turned North Korean in postproduction; doctors in Beijing saved IronMan while sipping Yili brand milk.)The sexual harassment story was proving to be a booking challenge. One actressafter another backed out, often after involving prominent publicists. “It’s justnot a topic we want to talk about,” went the responses. But the calls werekicking up dust, and Harvey Weinstein’s name was coming up in our research againand again.One producer, Dede Nickerson, arrived at 30 Rock for an interview about theChina story. We sat in a bland conference room that you’ve seen on a hundredDatelines, beautified with a potted plant and colored lights. Afterward, asMcHugh and the crew broke down our equipment and Nickerson strode off to thenearest elevator bank, I trailed after her.“I meant to ask one more thing,” I said, catching up to her. “We’re doing astory about sexual harassment in the industry. You used to work for HarveyWeinstein, right?”Nickerson’s smile slackened.“I’m sorry,” she said. “I can’t help you.”We’d reached the elevators.“Sure, okay. If there’s anyone you think I should talk to—”“I have a flight to catch,” she said. As she got in the elevator, she paused andadded, “Just… be careful.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]A few days later, I hunched over a desk in one of the glass cubes set aside forprivate calls on the margins of the newsroom, dialing Rose McGowan, whom I’dreached over Twitter. We’d met once before, in 2010, when I was working at theState Department. Pentagon officials had announced she was visiting and asked ifI’d join them for lunch, like they were looking for a language specialist andfigured I spoke fluent actress. McGowan had met the officials on a recent USOtour. In pictures, there she was, at Kandahar Air Field or in Kabul, in neon,low-cut tees and skinny jeans, long hair blowing in the wind. “I looked like astylized bombshell,” she’d later recall. McGowan was a charismatic screenpresence, exuding a quick wit and an acid sense of humor in a series of earlyperformances—The Doom Generation, Jawbreaker, Scream—that made her an indie filmdarling. But in recent years the parts had been fewer and schlockier. When wemet, her last lead appearance had been in Planet Terror, a B-movie homagedirected by her then-boyfriend Robert Rodriguez, in which she played a strippernamed Cherry Darling with a machine gun for a leg.At that lunch in 2010, McGowan and I hit it off. She whispered quotes from thefilm Anchorman, and I served them back. She knew I’d grown up in a Hollywoodfamily. She talked about acting—the fun roles, and the sexist or exploitativeones, which was most of them. She made it plain that she was tiring of thebusiness and its oppressively narrow view of women. The next day, she emailed:“Whatever I can do in the future, I will make myself available. Please do nothesitate to ask.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]In 2017, McGowan picked up my call from the newsroom. Her counterculture streakwas still evident. She told me Roy Price, the head of Amazon’s nascent movie andtelevision studio, had greenlit a surrealistic show she was creating about acult. She forecast a battle over the patriarchal power structures in Hollywoodand beyond. “Nobody’s covered what Hillary losing means to women,” she said.“The war against women is real. This is ground zero.” She talked, unflinchinglyand far more specifically than in her tweets, about her allegation thatWeinstein had raped her.“Would you name him on camera?” I asked.“I’ll think about it,” she said. She was working on a book, and weighing howmuch to reveal in its pages. But she was open to beginning the process oftelling the story before then, too.The media, McGowan said, had rejected her, and she had rejected the media.“So why talk to me?” I asked.“Because you’ve lived it,” she said. “I saw what you wrote.”About a year earlier, the Hollywood Reporter had put out a laudatory profile ofmy father, Woody Allen, with only a glancing mention of the allegations ofsexual abuse leveled against him by my sister Dylan. The magazine faced intensecriticism for the piece, and Janice Min, the Hollywood Reporter’s editor,decided to face it directly, asking me to write about whether there was merit tothe backlash.The truth is, I’d spent most of my life avoiding my sister’s allegation—and notjust publicly. I did not want to be defined by my parents, or by the worst yearsof my mother’s life, of my sister’s life, of my childhood. Mia Farrow is one ofthe great actors of her generation, and a wonderful mom who sacrificed greatlyfor her kids. And yet so much of her talent and reputation was consumed by themen in her life, and I took from that a desire to stand on my own, to be knownbest for my work, whatever it might be. That left what happened in my childhoodhome frozen in amber, in ancient tabloid coverage and permanentdoubt—unresolved, unresolvable.So I decided to interview my sister about what happened, in detail, for thefirst time. And I dove into the court records and any other documents I couldfind. By the account Dylan gave when she was seven years old and has repeatedprecisely ever since, Allen took her to a crawl space in our family’s home inConnecticut and penetrated her with a finger. She’d already complained to atherapist about Allen touching her inappropriately. (The therapist, hired byAllen, did not disclose the complaints until later, in court.) Immediatelybefore the alleged assault, a babysitter had seen Allen with his face in Dylan’slap. When a pediatrician finally did report the allegation to the authorities,Allen hired what one of his lawyers estimated to be ten or more privatedetectives through a network of attorneys and subcontractors. They trailed lawenforcement officials, looking for evidence of drinking or gambling problems. Aprosecutor in Connecticut, Frank Maco, later described a “campaign to disruptthe investigators,” and colleagues said he was rattled. Maco dropped the effortto charge Allen, attributing the decision to his desire to spare Dylan thetrauma of trial, taking pains to state that he’d had “probable cause” toproceed.I told Min I would write an op-ed. I made no claim to be an impartial arbiter ofmy sister’s story—I cared about her and supported her. But I argued that herclaim fell into a category of credible sexual abuse allegations that were toooften ignored by both the Hollywood trade outlets and the wider news media.“That kind of silence isn’t just wrong. It’s dangerous,” I wrote. “It sends amessage to victims that it’s not worth the anguish of coming forward. It sends amessage about who we are as a society, what we’ll overlook, who we’ll ignore,who matters and who doesn’t.” I hoped it would be my one and only statement onthe matter.“I was asked to say something. I did,” I told McGowan, trying to get off thesubject. “That’s the end of it.”She laughed bitterly. “There’s no end to it.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]I wasn’t the only journalist trying to get to McGowan. Seth Freedman, the sameEnglish writer for the Guardian who’d called Ben Wallace offering to help withhis reporting, had been emailing HarperCollins, the publisher of McGowan’s book.Freedman was persistent, reaching out repeatedly to express support and lobbyfor an interview. When he got on the phone with Lacy Lynch, a literary agentadvising McGowan, he was vague about his reporting. He said he was working witha group of journalists on a story about Hollywood. He wouldn’t say whether therewas a specific publication attached. But Lynch told McGowan she thought thewriter was benign, and that it seemed like an interesting opportunity.Not long after my conversation with McGowan, she and Freedman were on the phone.He told her he was outside the farm his family owned in the English countryside,speaking quietly to avoid waking anyone. “What did you want to talk to meabout?” McGowan asked.“We’re looking to do a snapshot of what life is like in 2016/17 for people inHollywood,” he explained. He broached McGowan’s sharp criticism of Donald Trump,suggesting that there might be an opportunity for “a kind of spinoff piece,”about her activism. It sounded like a lot of resources were being put into hisefforts. He repeatedly mentioned other, unnamed journalists who were helping himgather information.McGowan had seen more than her share of betrayal and abuse, and she was usuallyguarded. But Freedman was warm, candid, even confessional. Several times, hereferenced his wife and their growing family. Slowly, McGowan warmed to him,talked about her life story, at one point cried. As she heaved off plates ofarmor, he grew more specific. “Obviously everything we say is off the record,but I’ve spoken to people who’ve worked at, you know, say, Miramax, who’ve toldme ‘I’m NDA’d’ and they can’t talk about anything that’s happened to them butthey’re desperate to say ‘X person abused me or X person made my life hell.’”“My book is gonna address a lot of these things,” McGowan said.Freedman seemed very interested in her book, and what she planned to say in it.“How can you get the publisher to publish it?” he asked, referring to herallegation.“I actually have a signed document,” she said. “A signed document from the timeof the attack.”But what would the consequences be, he wondered, if she said too much? “Mostpeople I talk to in Hollywood, they say, you know, I’m not allowed to talk aboutit on record,” he said.“Because they’re all too scared,” McGowan replied.“And if they do say it,” Freedman continued, “then they’ll never work again orthey’ll never—” But he didn’t get to say what else. McGowan was talkative bynow, on to her next point.One, two, three times, Freedman wondered who in the media she planned to talk tobefore the book, and how much she planned to tell them. “Who would your idealplatform be right now to tell that message?” he asked. “Does that mean you keepthe name out of the press because you would suffer,” he said, alluding again tothose consequences, “if you put the name out there and then someone came back atyou?”“I don’t know. I’ll see how I feel,” McGowan said.Freedman sounded full of empathy, an ally. “So,” he asked, “what would make youkind of call it quits?”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter006]CONTINENTAL [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter006]“They have been fighting for years on this,” I said. A week after my call withMcGowan, I sat at the anchor’s table in Studio 1A, Today show cameras rolling.I’d just wrapped a segment on the battle between safety advocates and thetrucking industry over whether to require side guards on tractor-trailers, tostop cars from slipping under them. The safety advocates said the move wouldsave lives. The lobbyists said it would be too expensive. “Ronan, great job,”Matt Lauer said, and turned briskly to the next segment. “Really strong,” headded, as he filed off set during the next commercial break, productionassistants swarming, handing him his coat, gloves, script pages. “And goodengagement afterwards, got people talking.”“Thanks,” I said. He stepped closer.“Hey, how are those other stories coming along?”I wasn’t sure which ones he meant. “There’s the big one on the contaminatedCalifornia farmlands. I think you’ll find it interesting.”“Sure, sure,” he said. There was a beat of silence.“And I’ll be on around the Oscars for the Hollywood one I mentioned,” I tried,tentative.He frowned a little. Then his smile snapped back on. “Great,” he said, clappingme on the back. Over his shoulder as he walked toward the exit, he added:“Anything you need, you come to me, okay?”I watched him step into the cold air of the plaza, a burst of shrieks from thefans sounding as he passed through the revolving door.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]It was early February 2017. McHugh and I were ensconced in meetings with thenetwork’s legal and standards departments as they scrutinized every element ofthe upcoming Hollywood stories. Editorial oversight fell to an NBC veteran namedRichard Greenberg, who had recently been appointed interim head of the network’sinvestigative unit. Greenberg wore crumpled tweeds and reading glasses. He hadspent nearly seventeen years at NBC, ten of them as a Dateline producer, severalmore vetting pieces for the standards department. He was quiet, bureaucratic.But he also professed strong moral convictions. In his Dateline producer’s blog,he called sexual abusers “perverts” and “monsters.” After working with ChrisHansen of To Catch a Predator on a story in a Cambodian brothel, Greenbergwrote: “often, when I lie awake in bed at night, I am haunted by the faces ofthe girls we saw who were not rescued and who are still being violated.” Thelawyer vetting the series was a Harvard Law alumnus named Steve Chung, who wasstudiously serious.That week in February, McHugh and I sat with Greenberg in his office near thefourth-floor newsroom and outlined our shooting schedule for the following week,including some interviews to be conducted with the subjects obscured in shadow,as was frequent practice in my investigative work and so many Dateline storiesGreenberg had worked on. He nodded approvingly. “And you’ve talked all thisthrough with Chung?” he asked. I had. Greenberg then swiveled to his computermonitor and pulled up a browser. “I just want to double-check—”He typed in both of my parents’ names and Weinstein’s. “Good idea,” I said.“Hadn’t thought of that.” The results were what we’d expected: like most studioheads, Weinstein had touched movies both of my parents worked on. He’ddistributed several Woody Allen movies in the nineties, and, more recently, afew my mother appeared in during the 2000s. Movie distribution tends to be anarm’s length business: I’d never heard Weinstein’s name from either of them.“Looks good,” Greenberg said, after scrolling through several articles. “Justdouble-checking to make sure there’s no secret axe to grind there. Clearly not.”“Other than caring about the issue, no,” I said. I’d liked Weinstein the onetime I’d met him, at an event hosted by the CBS News anchor Charlie Rose.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]A few days later, I sat in a Santa Monica hotel room. Dennis Rice, a veteranmarketing executive, perspired heavily. Studio lights with cube-shaped shadesthrew him into shadow. Initially, we had planned only to discuss the story onrigged awards campaigns. Then I’d asked him about his time as Harvey Weinstein’spresident of marketing at Miramax in the late ’90s and early 2000s, and he’dgrown nervous. “You have no idea how tough this gets for me if I say anything,”he told me. But Rice sensed there was an opportunity to help with somethingimportant, and agreed to come back for the follow-on interview in front of theharsh lights.“There was money available in the event that there was an indiscretion thatneeded to be taken care of,” he said of his time at Miramax.“What kinds of indiscretions?” I asked.“Bullying, physical abuse, sexual harassment.”He said he’d witnessed, firsthand, his boss “inappropriately touching” youngwomen, and regretted not saying more. “They were paid off,” he said of thewomen. “They were encouraged to not make this a big deal, otherwise their careermay end.” He said he knew of specific cases of retaliation and, when the camerasstopped rolling, glanced around and said, “Find Rosanna Arquette.” The actresshad come to prominence with her leading role in Desperately Seeking Susan. InPulp Fiction, which Weinstein distributed, she’d had a small but memorable partas the heavily pierced wife of a drug dealer. “I don’t know,” Rice said, wipingthe accumulated sweat from his forehead. “Maybe she’ll talk.”Reviewing the footage later, I rewound to an exchange about the culture aroundWeinstein and hit Play again.“And for all of the people around this man who saw this sort of thing going on,”I asked, “did anyone speak up against it?”“No,” he said.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]That evening and in the days that followed, I worked the phones. I wasassembling a growing list of women, often actresses and models but sometimesproducers or assistants, who were rumored to have voiced complaints aboutWeinstein. Certain names kept recurring, like McGowan’s, and that of an Italianactress and director, Asia Argento.I called back Nickerson, the producer who’d been hesitant to talk aboutWeinstein before.“I’m so tired of what happens to women in this industry. I want to help, I do,”she said. “I saw things. And then they paid me off and I signed a piece ofpaper.”“What did you see?”A pause. “He couldn’t control himself. It’s who he is. He’s a predator.”“And you can speak to having witnessed that?”“Yes.”She agreed to go on camera, too. Sitting in shadow at the Encino estate whereshe was staying, she independently recalled a pattern of predation eerilysimilar to the one described by Rice.“I think that happened all the time, the groping,” she said in the interview.“This wasn’t a one-off. This wasn’t a period of time. This was ongoingpredatorial behavior towards women—whether they consented or not.” She said thatit was almost ludicrously embedded in the corporate culture; that there wasessentially a pimp on company payroll with only the thinnest job description tocover for his role procuring women for their boss.“Was it common knowledge that he was being, to use a term you used, ‘predatory’around women?” I asked.“Absolutely,” she said. “Everybody knew.”“FYI, that story is evolving into a pretty serious reporting job on HW,” Itexted Oppenheim. “Both execs are naming him on cam, but one is asking me not toshow actual footage of him saying the name,” I wrote, referring to Rice. “Peopleare pretty freaked out about reprisals.” Oppenheim wrote back: “I can imagine.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The more people I called, the more Rice and Nickerson’s claims were borne out. Iwas also looking for defenses of Weinstein. But those I found rang hollow.Nickerson had named a producer whom she believed to be a victim. I finallytracked her down in Australia, where she’d gone to start a new life. When shetold me that she had nothing to say about Weinstein, there was strain andsadness in her voice that suggested I’d placed her in a difficult situation.A conversation with Donna Gigliotti, the Shakespeare in Love producer, went muchthe same way.“I mean, have I heard things? Maybe. But have I seen things?” she asked.“What did you hear?”An exasperated sigh, as if the question were ludicrous.“The man is not a saint. Trust me, there is no love lost between us. But heisn’t guilty of anything worse than what a million other men in this businessdo.”“Are you saying there’s not a story there?”“I’m saying,” Gigliotti said, “that your time is better spent elsewhere. Othershave looked at this, you know. They all come up empty.”I did not know. But soon enough I was encountering references to other outletsthat had circled the story. Two years earlier, a New York magazine writer,Jennifer Senior, had tweeted: “At some pt, all the women who’ve been afraid tospeak out abt Harvey Weinstein are gonna have to hold hands and jump.” And thenlater: “It’s a despicable open secret.” The comments had generated a few blogitems, then faded away. I sent her a message asking to talk. “I wasn’t reportingon it,” she told me. “David Carr, my office spouse when he was at NYMag, did afeature about him and came back with story after story about what a pig he was.”Carr, the essayist and media reporter, who died in 2015, had recounted to Senioranecdotes about Weinstein flashing and groping women, but never got enough torender them publishable. “Lots of people have been trying to get this story,”Senior told me, and wished me luck, like she was encouraging Don Quixote about awindmill.I called other people close to Carr who added something else: he had becomeparanoid while working on the story. His widow, Jill Rooney Carr, told me thather husband believed that he was being surveilled, though he didn’t know bywhom. “He thought he was being followed,” she recalled. Other than that, Carrappeared to have taken his secrets to the grave.After the interviews with Rice and Nickerson, I met with a friend who worked asan assistant to a prominent NBCUniversal executive and who passed me contactinformation for another round of potential sources. “My question is,” shetexted, “would Today run something like this? Seems kind of heavy for them.”“Noah, the new head of the show,” I wrote back, “he’ll champion it.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The next week, on the morning of February 14, Igor Ostrovskiy, the pudgyUkrainian who’d met with Roman Khaykin, the bald Russian, at Nargis Cafe, sat ina hotel lobby in Midtown Manhattan. Khaykin had dispatched him there, on one ofthe jobs for the mysterious new client. Ostrovskiy pretended to be engrossed inhis phone, while discreetly capturing video of a graying middle-aged man in atrench coat shaking hands with a tall, dark man in a suit. Then he followed thetwo men to the hotel restaurant and sat at a table nearby.The last few days had been busy with these assignments in fancy hotel lobbiesand restaurants, surveilling meetings between operatives sent by the mysteriousclient and what appeared to be unsuspecting marks. Ostrovskiy’s task was“countersurveillance”: he was supposed to make sure the client’s operativesweren’t followed.That day in the hotel restaurant, Ostrovskiy texted a picture of the proceedingsto Khaykin, then ordered a continental breakfast. The food was a perk of theassignment. “Enjoy yourself,” his boss had said. “Have a nice meal.” As juiceand rolls arrived, Ostrovskiy strained to hear the conversation at the nexttable. The men had accents he couldn’t quite place. Eastern European, maybe. Heoverheard snatches of dialogue about far-flung locations: Cyprus; a bank inLuxembourg; something about men in Russia.Mostly, Ostrovskiy spent his days hunting collectors of worker’s compensationwith fake limps or trying to catch straying spouses violating their prenuptialagreements. The suited operatives involved in these new assignments, some ofwhom seemed to have a military bearing, were something else. He swiped throughthe footage of the men and wondered who it was he was watching, and for whom."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter007]PHANTOMS [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter007]I was in a car, threading my way through West Hollywood toward my next shoot,when the announcement came over the wires: Noah Oppenheim had been promoted topresident of NBC News. He was taking on a slate of make-or-break projectsalongside his boss, Andy Lack, who oversaw both NBC News and MSNBC. Their firstorder of business: launching Megyn Kelly, the former Fox News anchor, in a newrole at NBC. Several positive profiles highlighted Oppenheim’s Ivy League lusterand screenwriting career and rapid ascent through the cutthroat world oftelevision. Oppenheim’s and Lack’s predecessors had both been women. DeborahTurness, who preceded Oppenheim, was described in lightly sexist profiles ashaving “rock-chick swagger,” which as far as I could tell just meant shesometimes chose to wear pants. Patricia Fili-Krushel, whom Lack replaced, was anexecutive with a background in human resources and daytime television. The chainof command was now all male, all white: Noah Oppenheim, and above him Andy Lack,and above him Steve Burke, the CEO of NBCUniversal, and Brian Roberts, the CEOof its parent company, Comcast. “I am pretty, pretty, pretty into thisannouncement. Congrats, my friend!” I texted Oppenheim, sucking up a little butalso sincerely meaning it. “Hah—thanks,” he wrote back.I flicked through my contacts, hovered over my sister Dylan’s name, then calledher for the first time in months. “I’m headed into an interview,” I told her.“It’s with a well-known actress. She’s accusing a very powerful person of a veryserious crime.”In family photographs, Dylan, two and a half years my senior, often shelteredbehind me: there we were, in Huggies on the ugly brown couch in the living room;before my first kindergarten play, her in a rabbit onesie, knuckles mid-noogie,grinding into my head; in front of various tourist attractions, laughing,usually hugging.I was surprised she’d picked up. She usually didn’t keep her cell on her. Infrank moments, she’d confessed that ringing phones made her heart race. Men’svoices on the other end of the line, especially, were a challenge. She’d neverheld a job that involved lots of phone calls. Dylan was a talented writer andvisual artist. Her work was rooted in worlds as far from this one as she couldmanage. As kids, we’d invented an elaborate fantasy kingdom, populated withpewter figurines of dragons and fairies. Fantasy remained her escape. She wrotehundreds of pages of minutely described fiction and painted faraway landscapes.These sat in drawers. When I suggested that she build a portfolio or submit amanuscript, she’d freeze, get defensive. I didn’t understand, she’d say.On the phone that day in February, she paused. “And you want my advice?” sheasked, eventually. Her allegation, and the questions that swirled between us asto whether I’d done enough, soon enough, to acknowledge it, had introduced aspace between us that hadn’t been there in the childhood photos.“Yes, I want your advice,” I said.“Well, this is the worst part. The considering. The waiting for the story. Butonce you put your voice out there, it gets a lot easier.” She sighed. “Just tellher to hang tough. It’s like ripping off a Band-Aid.” I thanked her. Anotherpause. “If you get this,” she said, “don’t let it go, okay?”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Rose McGowan lived in the quintessential movie star’s house: a stack of tanmidcentury modern boxes tucked into a grove of cypress trees high in theHollywood Hills. Outside, there was a wide terrace with a hot tub overlooking asweep of Los Angeles. Inside, it was staged as if for resale: no family photos,just art. By the front door there was a salvaged neon sign in the shape of abowler hat that read “THE DERBY: LADIES ENTRANCE.” Just beyond, atop a set ofstairs to the living room, there was a painting of a woman in a cage, engulfedin light. By a white brick fireplace in the living room, a bronze model ofMcGowan’s character from Planet Terror aimed its machine-gun leg.The woman who sat opposite me was not the one I’d met seven years before.McGowan looked tired, a hard tension across her face. She wore a loose beigesweater and little makeup. Her head was shaved, military-style. She’d mostlyabandoned acting in favor of music, sometimes accompanied by surrealperformance-art footage of herself. She’d tried her hand at directing, with ashort film, Dawn, that screened at Sundance in 2014. In the film, a repressedteenage girl circa 1961 is lured by two young men into a secluded area, brainedwith a rock, then shot dead.McGowan had a rough childhood. She’d grown up in the Children of God cult in theItalian countryside, where women had been harsh and men brutal—one, she latertold me, sliced a wart off her finger, without warning, at age four, leaving herstunned and bleeding. For a period of time, as a teenager, she was homeless.When she made it in Hollywood, she thought she had put the risk of exploitationbehind her. She told me that shortly before Weinstein assaulted her, during theSundance Film Festival in 1997, she’d turned to a camera crew following her andsaid, “I think my life is finally getting easier.”In the living room, as cameras rolled, she described how her business managerset the meeting where the alleged assault happened and how it had been abruptlymoved from a hotel restaurant to a hotel suite. She recalled the routine firsthour with the man she then considered only her boss, and his praise for herperformance in one film he’d produced, Scream, and in another she was stillworking on, Phantoms. Then she relived the part that still visibly shook her.“On the way out, it turned into not a meeting,” she said. “It all happens veryfast and very slow. I think any survivor can tell you that… all of a sudden,your life is like ninety degrees in the other direction. It’s—it’s a shock tothe system. And your brain is trying to keep up with what’s going on. All of asudden, you have no clothes on.” McGowan tried to stay composed. “I started tocry. And I didn’t know what was happening,” she recalled. “And I’m very small.This person’s very big. So do that math.”“Was this a sexual assault?” I asked.“Yes,” she said simply.“Was this a rape?”“Yes.”McGowan said she contacted a criminal attorney and considered pressing charges.The attorney told her to shut up. “I’d done a sex scene,” she remembered thelawyer pointing out. “No one was ever gonna believe me.” McGowan decided not topress charges, and brokered a financial settlement instead, signing away herright to sue Weinstein. “That was very painful,” she said. “I thought $100,000was a lot of money at the time because I was a kid.” She considered it, on hispart, “an admission of guilt.”McGowan described a system—of assistants and managers and industry powerbrokers—that she furiously accused of complicity. She said staffers avertedtheir eyes as she walked into the meeting, and out of it. “They wouldn’t look atme,” she said. “They looked down, these men. They wouldn’t look at me in theeyes.” And she remembered her costar in Phantoms, Ben Affleck, seeing hervisibly distraught immediately after the incident, and hearing where she’d justcome from, and replying, “God damn it, I told him to stop doing this.”McGowan believed she’d been “blacklisted” after the incident. “I barely workedin movies ever again. And I was on a great trajectory. And then when I did doanother movie—it got sold to him for distribution,” she said, referring toPlanet Terror.For any survivor, memories haunt. For those with high-profile perpetrators,there’s an added quality of inescapability. “I would open the newspaper,”McGowan told me. “And there’s Gwyneth Paltrow giving him [an] award.” He was“omnipresent.” And then there were the red carpets and press junkets where she’dhave to pose with him, smiling. “I just left my body again,” she said. “I pastedthe smile on my face.” The first time she saw him again after the allegedassault, she threw up in a trash can.On camera, McGowan wasn’t yet saying Weinstein’s name. She was steeling herself,getting ready. But she referred to him during the interview again and again,urging viewers to “connect the dots.”“Did Harvey Weinstein rape you?” I asked. The room went pin-drop silent. McGowanpaused.“I’ve never liked that name,” she said. “I have a hard time saying it.”Off camera, she’d already used his name with me. Partly, she’d said, her concernwas making sure she had a news organization that would go all the way with thestory if she exposed herself to legal jeopardy. I was frank with her: this wouldbe a delicate legal process at NBC. I’d need to be armed with every detail shecould give me.“Have the lawyers watch this,” she said.“Oh, they will be,” I said, with a grim laugh.“Watch it,” she said, looking into the camera, tears in her eyes. “Not just readit. And I hope they’re brave, too. Because I tell you what, it’s happened totheir daughter, their mother, their sister.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter008]GUN [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter008]“The Rose interview is shocking,” I texted Oppenheim.“Wow,” he replied.“Felt like a bomb going off. Plus two Miramax execs on cam saying they sawpattern of sexual harassment. This’ll be fun for legal.”“Geez,” he wrote. “It sure will be.”As we finished our shooting for the Hollywood stories, McHugh and I traded callswith Greenberg, the head of the investigative unit, and Chung, the attorney. Bythen, I’d spoken to two people on McGowan’s management team with whom she’draised her complaint immediately after the meeting with Weinstein. If she waslying, she’d been doing so since that day in 1997.“She does sound a little… flighty,” Greenberg said.McHugh and I were back in the same hotel in Santa Monica, on a sunny day,preparing to interview a Chinese filmmaker. “Well, that’s why we line up a lotof corroboration,” I told Greenberg. “And she said she’ll give us the contractshe has with Weinstein—”“Careful about that,” Greenberg said.“What do you mean?” McHugh asked.“I don’t know that we can be interfering with contracts,” Greenberg said. “Let’sjust be careful if those are being handed over.”McHugh looked frustrated. “We should run this,” he said. “It’s explosive. It’snews.”“I just don’t see it being ready in time for this series,” Greenberg replied.The stories were due to run a week later, just before the Oscars.“I think I can get other women to talk in time for air,” I said.“Give it the time it needs,” Greenberg said. “The other stories can go now, andyou can expand the reporting here.” I got along well with the network’s legaland standards staff. I defended my stories in a, shall we say, caffeinated way.But I was a lawyer myself, and I admired the old-fashioned care that went intoproducing a piece for programs like Nightly News. NBC was a serious place thatvalued the truth, an institution that had leapt from radio, to broadcast, tocable, to the internet—that mattered when it was one of three networks half acentury ago and, in our fractured and fractious era, mattered still. As long aswe were using the time to strengthen the reporting, I didn’t mind a delay.“Okay,” I said. “We’ll hold it.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The reporting expanded like an inkblot. The day after the shoot with McGowan, wewere at the offices of the Hollywood Reporter for an interview with theirjournalist on the awards beat, Scott Feinberg. Harvey Weinstein was inescapablein that conversation, too: he had essentially invented the modern Oscarcampaign. Weinstein ran his campaigns like guerrilla wars. A Miramax publicistonce ghostwrote an op-ed praising the company’s movie Gangs of New York andpassed it off as the work of Robert Wise, the director of The Sound of Music,who was, at the time, eighty-eight. Weinstein orchestrated an elaborate smearcampaign against rival film A Beautiful Mind, planting press items claiming theprotagonist, mathematician John Nash, was gay (and, when that didn’t work, thathe was anti-Semitic). When Pulp Fiction lost a Best Picture Oscar to ForrestGump, he’d publicly threatened to arrive on director Robert Zemeckis’s lawn and“get medieval.”Before leaving the Hollywood Reporter, I met its new editor, Matt Belloni. I’dheard rumors that Janice Min, his predecessor who persuaded me to write theop-ed about the need for tougher coverage of sexual assault allegations, hadpursued the Weinstein allegations for years. When I asked whether the outlet hadcome up with anything, Belloni shook his head. “No one will talk.”But he did have ideas about industry figures who might know of other women withallegations. He suggested I call Gavin Polone, the former agent and manager—a“Ferrari-driving tenpercenter,” as Variety had described him. He’d since becomea successful producer, and developed a reputation as a firebrand. In 2014, he’dwritten a column for the Hollywood Reporter entitled “Bill Cosby and Hollywood’sCulture of Payoffs, Rape and Secrecy.” In it, he’d referenced a set ofallegations against an unnamed studio head who “used his power and money to keepit all quiet.” He accused journalists of avoiding the story because they were“afraid of being sued and more afraid of losing advertising.” No one, it seemed,had taken him up on the challenge.Polone had appeared as an occasional commentator on my MSNBC show. By the end ofthe day, I was on the phone with him. “It needs to be exposed,” he told me. He’dheard about a number of allegations against Weinstein. Some he’d heard directlyfrom accusers, others he’d become aware of secondhand. “The most egregiousexample, the holy grail of this story, is Annabella Sciorra,” he said. “Thiswasn’t harassment. It was rape.” I asked him to see if the women who’d toldtheir stories to him would talk to me. He promised he would.“One more thing,” he said, after I thanked him for his time. “Watch your back.This guy, the people protecting him. They’ve got a lot at stake.”“I’m being careful.”“You don’t understand. I’m saying be ready, in case. I’m saying get a gun.”I laughed. He didn’t.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Sources were scared. Many refused to talk. But others seemed willing. I reachedthe agent of an English actress who McGowan and others had suggested might havea complaint. “She told me the story in detail, as soon as we started workingtogether,” the agent told me. “He took out his penis and chased her around adesk during the shoot. He jumped on top of her, he pinned her down, but she gotaway.” I asked if the actress would talk. “She was very open about it at thetime,” the agent replied. “I don’t see why not.” A day later, he called backwith her phone number and email address: she’d be happy to discuss sitting foran interview.An agent who worked with Rosanna Arquette appeared to know what the request wasabout immediately. “Hard topic for her,” that agent said. “But I know she caresabout the issue. I’m sure she’ll talk.”I had reached Annabella Sciorra on Twitter. I told her it was about somethingsensitive. She seemed apprehensive, a little guarded. But we set a time for acall.I was also chasing the only allegation against Weinstein that had entered thecriminal justice system. In March 2015, Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, aFilipina-Italian model and onetime finalist in the Miss Italy pageant, hademerged from a meeting with Weinstein at his Tribeca offices and gone straightto the police to claim she’d been groped. New York law enforcement had broughtWeinstein in for questioning. The tabloids set about fevered coverage.Then something curious happened: the items about Weinstein were replaced withderogatory ones about Gutierrez. The tabloids reported that, in 2010, whenGutierrez was a young contestant in the Miss Italy pageant, she had attended a“Bunga Bunga” party hosted by Silvio Berlusconi, who was then the Italian primeminister, where he was accused of having sex with prostitutes. The items claimedthat Gutierrez herself was a hooker, with wealthy sugar daddies back in Italy.The day after the alleged incident, she’d attended Finding Neverland, a Broadwaymusical Weinstein produced, the Daily Mail observed. Later, she’d demanded amovie role, Page Six reported. Gutierrez said she’d never been a prostitute,that she’d been brought to Berlusconi’s party as a professional obligation andextricated herself as soon as its seedier dimensions became apparent, and thatshe’d made no demand for a movie role. But her denials were printed as anafterthought, or not at all. The pictures of Gutierrez shifted: there she was,day after day, in lingerie and bikinis. Increasingly, the tabloids seemed tosuggest that she was the predator, ensnaring Weinstein with her feminine wiles.And then, all at once, the charges went away. So did Ambra Gutierrez.But the name of a lawyer who represented Gutierrez had made it into publicreports, and lawyers have phones. “I’m not at liberty to talk about that,” hetold me. “Okay,” I said, having paid just enough attention in law school andmore than enough in real life to know an allusion to a nondisclosure agreementwhen I ran into one. “But can you pass on a message?”Gutierrez texted almost immediately. “Hello, my lawyer said you wanted tocontact me. Just wanted to ask about what,” she wrote.“I’m a reporter with NBC News, and this is for a Today show story I am workingon. I think it’s probably easiest to talk through on the phone, if you’recomfortable with that,” I replied.“Could you be a little more precise on what is about ‘I am working on’?” shewrote.Ambra Gutierrez, it was immediately apparent, was no fool.“It involves a claim being made by another individual—and potentially several ofthem—that may have some similarities to the one you brought, in the NYPDinvestigation in 2015. It could be a great service to others with claims if Icould talk to you.”She agreed to meet the next day.Before meeting with Gutierrez, I started methodically calling people who’d beeninvolved in the case. One of my contacts in the district attorney’s officecalled to say staff there had found Gutierrez credible. “There were… certainthings presented about her past,” the contact said.“What kind of things?”“I can’t get into that. But none of it made anyone here think she was lying. AndI heard we had some evidence.”“What kind of evidence?”“I don’t know exactly.”“Can you look into it?”“Sure. And I’ll just hand in my resignation right after.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter009]MINIONS [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter009]When I arrived at Gramercy Tavern, Gutierrez was already sitting in a backcorner, ramrod straight and perfectly still. “I’m always early,” she said. Thatwasn’t the half of it. She was, I came to find, a formidably organized andstrategic person. Gutierrez was born in Turin, Italy. She’d grown up watchingher Italian father, whom she described as a “Dr. Jekyll–and–Mr. Hyde person,”beat her Filipina mother. When Gutierrez tried to intervene, she was beaten aswell. As an adolescent, she became the caretaker, supporting her mother anddistracting her younger brother from the violence. She had an exaggeratedbeauty, like an anime character: vanishingly slender with improbably large eyes.That day at the restaurant, she seemed nervous. “I want to help,” she said, atremor in her Italian accent. “It’s just I’m in difficult situation.” It wasonly when I said that another woman had gone on camera with a complaint aboutWeinstein, and that still more were considering doing so, that she began to tellher story.In March 2015, Gutierrez’s modeling agent had invited her to a reception atRadio City Music Hall for New York Spring Spectacular, a show that Weinsteinproduced. As usual, Weinstein had rallied industry friends to support the show.He’d talked to Steve Burke, the CEO of NBCUniversal, and Burke had agreed toprovide costumes of characters from the ubiquitous Minions franchise. At thereception, Weinstein stared at Gutierrez openly across the room. He approachedand said hello, telling her and her agent several times that she looked like theactress Mila Kunis. After the event, Gutierrez’s modeling agency emailed her tosay that Weinstein wanted to set up a business meeting as soon as possible.Gutierrez arrived at Weinstein’s office in Tribeca early the next evening withher modeling portfolio. As she and Weinstein sat on a couch reviewing theportfolio, he began staring at her breasts, asking if they were real. Gutierrezsaid that Weinstein then lunged at her, groping her breasts and attempting toput a hand up her skirt while she protested. He finally backed off and told herthat his assistant would give her tickets to Finding Neverland later that night.He said he would meet her at the show.Gutierrez was twenty-two at the time. “Because of trauma in my past,” she toldme, “being touched for me was something that was very big.” After the encounterwith Weinstein, she remembered shaking, stopping by a bathroom, and beginning toweep. She caught a cab to her agent’s office and cried there, too. Then she andthe agent went to the nearest police station. She remembered arriving, andtelling the officers Weinstein’s name, and one saying, “Again?”Weinstein telephoned her later that evening, annoyed that she hadn’t come to theshow. She picked up the call while sitting with investigators from the SpecialVictims Division, who listened in and devised a plan: Gutierrez would agree tosee the show the following day and then meet with Weinstein. She would wear awire and attempt to extract a confession.“It was a scary decision, of course,” she said. “And of course I had a sleeplessnight.” Anyone asked to do something risky to expose something important has tobalance a complicated mix of self-interested and altruistic incentives.Sometimes, in some stories, the two coincide. But in this story, there wasalmost no upside. Gutierrez faced legal and professional annihilation. Shewanted only to stop Weinstein from doing it again. “Everyone told me the guycould close all the doors for me,” she said. “I was willing to risk this for thefact that this guy should not have done this to anyone anymore.”The following day, Gutierrez met Weinstein at the Tribeca Grand Hotel’s ChurchBar, a plush room with golden stars and clouds stenciled on its blue walls. Ateam of undercover officers kept watch. Weinstein was flattering. He said, againand again, how beautiful she was. He told her he’d help her get acting jobs, ifshe would just be his friend, and named several other prominent actresses forwhom, he said, he had done the same. The accent would need work, of course, buthe said he could arrange lessons.Weinstein excused himself to go to the restroom, then returned, demanding withsudden urgency that they go up to his penthouse suite. He said he wanted to takea shower. Gutierrez, frightened that he would touch her again or discover thatshe was wearing a wire, resisted. Undeterred, he tried to bring her upstairsrepeatedly. The first time, she used a tactic the officers had suggested,leaving behind a jacket and insisting they go back downstairs for it. The secondtime, one of the undercover officers, posing as a TMZ photographer, startedpeppering Weinstein with questions, sending him to complain to hotel staff.Gutierrez kept trying, and failing, to extricate herself. Finally, Weinstein gother upstairs, leading her toward his room. By this time, they’d lost theundercover officers. Adding to her problems, her phone, which officers hadinstructed her to keep on and recording in her purse as a backup, was runningout of power.With increasing belligerence, Weinstein demanded that she go into the room.Gutierrez, terrified, pleaded and tried to draw away. In the course of theinteraction, Weinstein copped to groping her the previous day: a full, dramaticconfession, caught on tape. She kept pleading, and he finally relented, and theywent downstairs. Officers, no longer concealing their identities, approachedWeinstein and said the police wanted to speak to him.Had he been charged, Weinstein could have faced a count of sexual abuse in thethird degree, a misdemeanor punishable by up to three months in jail. “We had somuch proof of everything,” Gutierrez told me. “Everyone was telling me,‘Congratulations, we stopped a monster.’” But then the tabloids began to publishtheir stories about Gutierrez’s supposed past as a prostitute. And the office ofManhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. began to raise the same points. WhenMartha Bashford, the head of Vance’s Sex Crimes Unit, questioned Gutierrez, shegrilled her about Berlusconi and her personal sexual history with unusualhostility, according to two law enforcement sources. The district attorney’spress office later told the New York Times that the questioning was “a normal,typical interview” intended to anticipate questions that would be raised in across-examination. The law enforcement sources disagreed. “They went at her likethey were Weinstein’s defense attorneys,” one of them told me. “It was weird,”Gutierrez recalled of the questioning. “I’m, like, ‘What is the connection? Idon’t understand. Just listen to the proof.’”On April 10, 2015, two weeks after Gutierrez reported Weinstein to the police,the district attorney’s office announced that it wasn’t going to press charges.It released a brief statement: “This case was taken seriously from the outset,with a thorough investigation conducted by our Sex Crimes Unit. After analyzingthe available evidence, including multiple interviews with both parties, acriminal charge is not supported.”The NYPD was incensed by the decision—so much so that the department’s SpecialVictims Division launched an internal review of the last ten criminal complaintsin Manhattan stemming from similar allegations of groping or forcible touching.“They didn’t have a quarter of the evidence we had,” still another lawenforcement source said of the other cases. “There were no controlled meets, andonly rarely controlled calls.” Yet, that source said, “all of them resulted inarrests.” The public had never learned of the damning evidence Vance possessed.Law enforcement officials began to whisper that the DA’s office had behavedstrangely. Vance’s staff had been receiving new information about Gutierrez’spast on a regular basis, and hadn’t been disclosing where it was coming from. Itwas, one official told me, as if Weinstein had infiltrated Vance’s officepersonally.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]At the time of the Gutierrez incident, Weinstein’s legal team was stacked withpolitical influence. Former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani was closelyinvolved. “Rudy was always in the office after the Ambra thing,” one WeinsteinCompany employee recalled. “He still had his mind then.” Giuliani worked so manyhours on the Gutierrez matter that a spat arose afterward over billing. Thesefights over invoices were a leitmotif in Weinstein’s business dealings.Several members of Weinstein’s legal team made donations to Vance’s campaigns.One attorney, Elkan Abramowitz, was a partner at the firm that formerly employedVance, and had contributed $26,450 to Vance’s campaigns since 2008. I recognizedAbramowitz’s name. When my sister reiterated her claim that Woody Allen sexuallyassaulted her, Allen dispatched Abramowitz to the morning shows to smile affablyand deny the allegations. That history made my feelings about Abramowitz lesspersonal, not more. This wasn’t about any one victim; this, for Abramowitz andmany other lawyers, was a cottage industry.David Boies had also worked on the Gutierrez imbroglio, and also kept theManhattan district attorney close. He’d been a longtime donor. He would give$10,000 to Vance’s reelection campaign in the months following the decision notto press charges.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]After that decision, Gutierrez was shaken, then worried about her future. “Icouldn’t sleep, I couldn’t eat,” she told me. As Weinstein leaned on his tabloidcontacts to drum up items portraying Gutierrez as a hustler, she felt likehistory was repeating. She believed that the stories from Italy about her havingworked as a prostitute were a product of her having testified in the corruptioncase against Berlusconi. She told me Berlusconi had used his power to smear her.“They said that I was a Bunga Bunga girl, that I was having affairs with sugardaddies,” she said. “Anyone who knows me knows those things are completelyfake.” Slut shaming, it seemed, was a universal language. Several tabloideditors later told me they regretted their coverage of Gutierrez, and felt itlaid uncomfortably bare Weinstein’s transactional relationships in theirindustry.Weinstein particularly exploited his bond with Pecker and Howard at the NationalEnquirer. Weinstein’s employees recalled an uptick in calls from him to Pecker.Howard ordered his staff to stand down on reporting about Gutierrez’s claim,then inquired about purchasing her story in order to bury it. And then there wasthe item the Enquirer ultimately ran, claiming, apparently based on its ownentreaties to Gutierrez, that she was flogging the story on the open market.It was as if “just because I am a lingerie model or whatever, I had to be in thewrong,” Gutierrez said. “I had people telling me, ‘Maybe it was how youdressed.’” (She had dressed in professional office attire to meet Weinstein,with thick tights because of the cold weather.) Her reputation was curdling. “Mywork depends on image, and my image was destroyed,” she said. Casting callsevaporated. Paparazzi laid siege to her apartment. Her brother called from Italyto say reporters had found him at work.When attorneys Gutierrez consulted urged her to accept a settlement, she atfirst resisted. But her resolve began to crack. “I didn’t want to make my familysuffer anymore,” she said. “I was twenty-two years old. I knew if he could movethe press in this way, I couldn’t fight him.” On the morning of April 20, 2015,Gutierrez sat in a law firm office in Midtown Manhattan with a voluminous legalagreement and a pen in front of her. In exchange for a million-dollar payment,she would agree to never again talk publicly about Weinstein or the effort tocharge him. “I didn’t even understand almost what I was doing with all thosepapers,” she told me. “I was really disoriented. My English was very bad. All ofthe words in that agreement were super-difficult to understand. I guess even nowI can’t really comprehend everything.” Across the table, Weinstein’s attorneyfrom Giuliani’s firm, Daniel S. Connolly, was trembling visibly as Gutierrezpicked up the pen. “I saw him shaking and I realized how big this was. But thenI thought I needed to support my mom and brother and how my life was beingdestroyed, and I did it,” she told me.“The moment I did it, I really felt it was wrong.” She knew people would judgeher for taking the money. “A lot of people are not empathetic,” she said. “Theydon’t put themselves in the situation.” After the contract was signed, Gutierrezbecame depressed and developed an eating disorder. Eventually, her brother, whowas concerned, came to the United States. “He knew I was really bad,” she said.He took her to Italy and then the Philippines “to start again.” She told me, “Iwas completely destroyed.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter010]MAMA [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter010]Two years later, Gutierrez shut her eyes at the memory. “Do you have thedocument?” I asked. She opened her eyes, stared at me. “I promise you,” I said,“I will only use anything I learn here today in a way you’re comfortable with.Even if it means giving up the story.” She picked up a white iPhone, beganclicking and scrolling. She pushed the phone across to me, letting me read themillion-dollar nondisclosure agreement.The document was eighteen pages long. It was signed, on the last page, byGutierrez and Weinstein. The lawyers involved in drafting it must have been soconvinced of its enforceability that they never considered the possibility of itemerging. The contract ordered the destruction of all copies of audio recordingsof Weinstein admitting to the groping. Gutierrez agreed to give her phone andany other devices that might have contained evidence to Kroll, aprivate-security firm retained by Weinstein. She also agreed to surrender thepasswords to her email accounts and other forms of digital communication thatcould have been used to spirit out copies. “The Weinstein confidentialityagreement is perhaps the most usurious one I have seen in decades of practice,”one attorney who represented Gutierrez later told me. A sworn statement,pre-signed by Gutierrez, was attached to the agreement, to be released in theevent of any breach. It stated that the behavior Weinstein admitted to in therecording never happened.I looked up from the agreement, and the reporter’s notebook in which I’d beentranscribing notes as quickly as I could. “Ambra. Are all the copies of the tapedestroyed?”Gutierrez folded her hands in her lap and looked at them.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]A moment later, I was walking fast out of the restaurant and toward the subway,dialing Rich McHugh. I told him the story. “It’s real,” I said. “And there’saudio of him admitting to it.”I texted Noah Oppenheim. “I’m now in touch with five women with HW allegations,FYI. I just met with a model who wore a wire for an NYPD investigation in 2015.She’s going to play me the recordings. She wants to talk but she took a payoutwith an NDA—she showed me the document. It’s legit. Signed by HW, a milliondollars.” When he replied hours later, he asked only, “Who’s your producer onthis?” then fell silent.Back at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, McHugh and I sat opposite Rich Greenberg in hisoffice on the fourth floor. “It’s quite a story,” Greenberg said, leaning backin his mesh office chair.“I mean, it’s huge,” said McHugh. “He admits to a crime.”Greenberg swiveled toward his monitor.“Let’s see here…,” he said, typing Gutierrez’s name into Google and switchingover to the Images tab. He scrolled through a few pictures of Gutierrezsprawling seductively in lingerie and said, “Not bad.”“We’re close to a big piece of evidence here,” I said, impatient. “She saysshe’ll play the audio for me.”“Well, let’s see about that,” Greenberg said.“And there’s the contract,” McHugh added.“That part’s complicated,” Greenberg said. “We can’t be making her breachcontract.”“We’re not making her do anything,” I replied.Later that afternoon, I called Chung, the NBC lawyer. “Theoretically, someonecould say we induced her to violate the contract. But that tort is weird. Thereare a lot of conflicting interpretations of what’s required to prove it. Somesay you need to demonstrate the defendant had the sole purpose of violating thecontract, which obviously isn’t your objective,” he said. “I’m sure Rich is justbeing careful.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]I had tried Jonathan a few times over the course of the afternoon but only gotthrough as I ducked out of Rockefeller Plaza at sunset. “Six calls!” he said. “Ithought it was an emergency!” He was stepping out of a meeting. “Five!” Icountered. We’d met shortly after he left his job as a presidentialspeechwriter. In the years we’d been together, he’d drifted, creating ashort-lived sitcom and tweeting a lot. A couple of months earlier, he and hisfriends had started a media company focused on podcasts on the West Coast. Ithad taken off faster than anyone predicted. His trips to New York had becomeshorter and less frequent.“I’m checking,” he was saying.“Do it,” I replied. I waited thirty seconds. “Jonathan!”“Sorry! Forgot you were there.” This happened more than you’d think. These days,our relationship consisted almost exclusively of endless calls. Occasionally,he’d try to pause me, forgetting I wasn’t a podcast.My phone pinged. I looked down to see a string of twenty or thirty Instagrammessage alerts. They came from an account with no profile photo. They read, overand over, “I’m watching you, I’m watching you, I’m watching you.” I swiped themaway. Strange messages were an occupational hazard of being on television.“The crazies love me,” I said to Jonathan, and read him the messages.“He thinks he loves you, but wait until he experiences dating you.”“What does that mean?”“It means I love you?”“Does it?”“Just working on my vows for the ceremony. On the moon. In our gravity boots.”This was a running joke. Jonathan’s mother wanted grandchildren, and not in theage of lunar bases.“This conversation again?” I said, playing along.“Just get someone at NBC to take a look at the threats. Take it seriously,please.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]After that first meeting with Gutierrez, I followed up again with the samecontact in the district attorney’s office. “It’s weird,” the contact said. “Therecording. It’s referenced in the case files. But I don’t think we have it.”This seemed improbable. The DA’s office would, according to standard procedure,have retained any evidence, in case the investigation was ever reopened. I said“thank you” and chalked it up to an insufficiently thorough search.A week after our first conversation, I met with Gutierrez again, at a basementnoodle place near Union Square. She’d arrived from a casting call, in full hairand makeup. It was like conducting an interview in a shampoo commercial. Shetalked about Berlusconi’s corrupt media empire, and how she’d marshaled thestrength to help expose him. With each conversation we had, she sounded morelike she was ready to do it again.Earlier in the day, she’d sent me a picture of an ancient MacBook and explainedthat she’d lost the charging cable. I had found a cable of the right vintageand, as we talked, the laptop charged on a nearby chair. I kept glancing over atit nervously. Finally I asked, as nonchalantly as possible, if she thought ithad enough juice. The restaurant was noisy, so we left and walked around thecorner to a Barnes & Noble. She opened the laptop again. Glancing from one sideto the other, she navigated through a series of subfolders, past modeling photosand innocuous-looking Word documents.“Before the order to give all my phone, my computer,” she said, as she delveddeeper into her hard drive, “I sent recording to myself, to all my emails.”She’d agreed to give Kroll the passwords to all those accounts, and knew they’dfind any she didn’t disclose. But, in order to buy herself a brief window ofopportunity, she’d told them she couldn’t recall one password. Then, as Krollwiped the other accounts, one by one, she’d logged into the one for which shewas supposedly recovering the password, forwarded the audio to a temporary“burner” email, then cleared her sent mail. Finally, she downloaded the files tothis old laptop, which she stuffed in the back of a closet. “I was not sure itworks,” she said. “It was like—” She made a gasping noise and held her breath,as if bracing for the worst. But Kroll didn’t come knocking, and the laptopcollected dust, uncharged, for two years.On the screen in front of her, Gutierrez came to a folder labeled “Mama.” Insidewere audio files titled Mama1, Mama2, and Mama3: the recordings she’d had tofrantically start each time her phone issued a push alert about its dwindlingbattery life during the police sting. She passed me a pair of headphones, and Ilistened. It was all there: the promises of career advancement, the list ofother actresses he had helped, the encounter with the officer Weinstein thoughtwas a TMZ photographer. In the recording, Gutierrez’s panic was palpable. “Idon’t want to,” she said, standing in the hallway outside his room, refusing togo farther as Weinstein’s tone turned menacing. “I want to leave,” she added. “Iwant to go downstairs.” At one point, she asked him why he had groped herbreasts the day before.“Oh, please, I’m sorry, just come on in,” Weinstein replied. “I’m used to that.Come on. Please.”“You’re used to that?” Gutierrez asked, incredulous.“Yes,” Weinstein said. He added, “I won’t do it again.”After almost two minutes of back-and-forth in the hallway, he finally agreed toreturn to the bar.Weinstein wheedled and menaced and bullied and didn’t take no for an answer. Butmore than that, it was a smoking gun. It was inarguable. There he was, admittingnot just to a crime but to a pattern. “I’m used to that.”“Ambra,” I said, slipping off the headphones. “We need to make this public.”I produced a USB drive from my pocket and slid it toward her across thecountertop.“I can’t tell you what to do,” I said. “The decision is yours.”“I know that,” she replied. She closed her eyes, seemed to sway for a moment. “Iwill,” she said. “But not yet.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter011]BLOOM [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter011]The second meeting with Gutierrez made me late for drinks with a formerassistant to Phil Griffin, my old boss at MSNBC. “This is the most importantstory I’ve ever been on,” I texted her. “If I am late it’s because I haveabsolutely no choice.” After journalism, drama and being late were my greatpassions.“No worries hope it’s going well,” she replied tolerantly.I was still apologizing when I arrived at the little French bistro where we’dagreed to meet. When I asked how Griffin was, she said it was funny I shouldmention it—that he’d asked after me, too.Griffin was the one who took a chance on me and brought me inside NBC. He was atalented producer who’d worked his way up through roles at CNN and, later, theToday show and Nightly News. At CNN, he’d focused on sports. He was passionateabout baseball, and gracious about my incomprehension during his impassionedmonologues about it. He talked about a lifelong dream of working for the NewYork Mets, and you got the sense he was only mostly joking. At the helm ofMSNBC, he’d overseen the cable channel’s periods of greatest success, andsurvived its brutal low points. Griffin was the son of a Macy’s executive andgrew up in wealthy suburbs outside New York City and Toledo. Trim and bald andexcitable, he had the carefree bearing of a man who’d mostly gotten his way.In the two years since my show was canceled, our contact had been limited tocordial office run-ins. I wondered if the former assistant was just being politewith the comment about Griffin mentioning me, and why I’d be on his radar if hehad.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Harvey Weinstein had been calling Boies, his attorney, about Rose McGowan sinceshortly after she tweeted the previous fall. But it wasn’t until that springthat Weinstein mentioned NBC.“I’ve heard they’re doing a story,” Weinstein said. He wanted to know if Boieshad heard anything. Boies said he hadn’t. Within days, Weinstein was on thephone again, repeating the question.By the second call with Boies, Weinstein seemed unsatisfied with the lawyer’sanswers. “I know people at NBC,” Weinstein reminded Boies. “I’m gonna find outabout it.”Weinstein had been apprehensively calling his attorneys about news outletspursuing troublesome stories for years. But there was something different thistime: he began telling people around him that he was getting informationdirectly from NBC. Soon, he was relating claims about exactly how much thenetwork had—and the name of the reporter who was working on the story.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Over the following weeks, I kept meeting with Gutierrez at the Union SquareBarnes & Noble. She told me she’d meet with me and Greenberg and NBC’s legaldepartment to play them the audio and show them the contract. But she was stillgrappling with whether to actually hand over the evidence.After one of the meetings, I hesitated again before calling my sister Dylan.“So, you need my advice again,” she said, a teasing note in her voice.I explained the situation: a source, a tape, a contract. Everyone I spoke withwas a potential informant who might relay information back to Weinstein. If Iever fully assembled the story, I’d be laying out the reporting for him andseeking comment. But for now, I was vulnerable, and warnings from sources aboutWeinstein’s tactics had put me on edge. “Who do I turn to on this?” I asked her.“Who do I trust?”She thought for a moment. “You should call Lisa Bloom.”Lisa Bloom was the kind of lawyer who also plays one on television, but sheappeared to use the platform to defend not just her clients but also the idealof protecting survivors of sexual violence who confronted the rich and powerful.She had written and spoken repeatedly in defense of my sister, when few othersdid. “You, your sister and mother have comported yourself with grace and dignitythrough the storm, empowering sexual abuse survivors everywhere,” she’d writtento me once. “The very least I could do was to speak out about Dylan’s obviouscredibility.”Bloom had appeared often on my show, representing accusers of Bill O’Reilly andof Bill Cosby. “Rich and powerful people get a pass. I see this every day in myown practice,” she said in one segment about Cosby. “I represent many victims ofwealthy and successful predators. The first thing they do is go on the attackagainst the victim, try to dredge up anything from her life that they can findto embarrass her.” She’d seen how “women are smeared, or they are threatenedthat they will be smeared.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]When Bloom picked up, I offered to keep our conversation off the record. Shewaved this away. “Please,” she said. She had a warm voice with a slight rasp.“Most of the time, I’ll want to comment, you know that.”“Thanks,” I said. “But I’d appreciate your confidence, anyway.”“Of course,” she said.“I know we’re not under attorney-client privilege, but as a fellow lawyer, Itrust you. If I ask you about a sensitive story, do you feel comfortablepromising not to mention it to anyone until it comes out?”“Absolutely,” she said.I said I was working on a story involving heavy-duty nondisclosure agreementsand asked her view of their enforceability. She said the agreements usually heldup: that they often stipulated financially devastating liquidated damages as apenalty for breach, and contained arbitration clauses that allowed them to beenforced secretly, rather than in court. (Curiously, Gutierrez’s otherwisedraconian agreement had lacked such an arbitration clause.)Some entities, like Fox News, had of late declined to enforce the nondisclosureagreements signed by former employees with sexual harassment complaints. Bloomsaid it all depended on who was doing the enforcing.“It would help if I knew who this was about, Ronan.” She said this very slowly.“And you promise I have your word this will be kept in confidence?”“You have my word,” she said.“It’s about Harvey Weinstein.”I was standing in my apartment, looking out at a wall of warehouse-stylewindows. Through one, a sliver of a ballet studio was visible. A leotard-cladback strained in and out of frame.“I’m going to go to him for comment if it progresses to that point,” Icontinued. “But in the meantime it’s important, for these women, that it not getback to his people.”Another pause. Then Lisa Bloom said, “I understand completely.”Gutierrez and McGowan had both said they needed attorneys. As a reporter, I hadto maintain distance from sources’ legal cases. I’d told both that I couldn’tgive legal advice or directly recommend lawyers. But I could point them topublicly available information about experts in the field. I asked Bloom foradvice on attorneys with experience in cases involving nondisclosure agreements.McGowan would later reach out to one of them.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Harvey Weinstein’s standard approach to getting people on the phone was to barktheir names at the assistants stationed in the anteroom outside his office. Notlong after the calls with Boies about NBC, he shouted two new names: “Get meAndy Lack, now,” he said. “And Phil Griffin.”When Weinstein reached Lack, the studio head and the network head exchangedbrief pleasantries. But Weinstein, sounding anxious, got to the point quickly.“Hey,” he said, “your boy Ronan is doing a story on me. About the nineties andstuff.”My name seemed to register only dimly. Lack suggested Weinstein try Griffin, myold boss at MSNBC. To this, Weinstein launched into an argument about hisinnocence and the folly of the story.“Andy, it was the nineties. You know? Did I go out with an assistant or two thatI shouldn’t have, did I sleep with one or two of them, sure.”Lack said nothing to this.“It was the nineties, Andy,” Weinstein repeated. This seemed, for Weinstein, animportant point of exculpation. And then, with a note of menace: “We all didthat.”There was a pause before Andy Lack said, “Harvey, say no more. We’ll look intoit.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]It was evening when Bloom called again. I was heading home, emerging from asubway stop. “How’s it going?!” she asked. “I was thinking. You know, I actuallyknow David Boies a little. And—and even Harvey a little.”“You didn’t mention this to anyone, did you?” I asked Bloom.“Of course I didn’t! I’m just, you know, I had this idea I could maybe helpconnect you to them.”“Lisa, this is very sensitive, and very early. I promise you, I’ll get in touchwith him when the time comes. Just please, don’t say anything yet. You gave yourword.”“I just think it’s worth considering,” she said.“I’ll let you know if things develop further,” I replied.I was passing by St. Paul the Apostle, the fortress-like Gothic Revival churchnear my apartment. I looked up, then hurried out of its shadow.“I’m here if you need anything, okay?” Bloom said. “Anything at all.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter012]FUNNY [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter012]That week, McHugh and I sat in Greenberg’s office, updating him on theconversations with Gutierrez. I told him about her offer to meet with our legaldepartment and show them the evidence. “Let’s get this scheduled, before shegets cold feet,” I said.Greenberg wouldn’t commit to the meeting. He said we needed the audio in hand,not just played for us. I agreed but said Gutierrez was getting closer tosharing it and argued that the meeting with NBC might help persuade her.Greenberg again raised his concern that looking at contracts might incurliability. “You need to be running all of this by legal,” he said. He keptfiddling with a pen in front of him on the desk.I was reminding him that I’d run every step of the reporting by legal when thephone on his desk rang. He looked at the caller ID, paused.“It’s Harvey Weinstein,” Greenberg said. “He called earlier today.” McHugh and Ilooked at each other. This was news to us. Greenberg said Weinstein had pressedfor details about the story. He’d led with flattery, saying he was a fan ofmine, a fan of the network. Then he’d turned to saber-rattling.“He mentioned he’s retained some lawyers, ” Greenberg said.He flipped through some notes in front of him.“David Boies?” I asked.“He mentioned Boies, but there was someone else as well. Here it is, CharlesHarder.” Harder was the pitbull attorney who, in an invasion of privacy casebankrolled by the billionaire Peter Thiel, had recently prevailed in shuttingdown the gossip news site Gawker.“I told him we couldn’t discuss specifics, of course,” Greenberg continued. “Wedo this by the book. Let him call all he wants.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Our reporting was in limbo. Gutierrez was still deliberating about handing overthe audio. Rosanna Arquette’s agent had stopped returning my calls. The Englishactress confirmed the story her agent had told me, then got cold feet and fellsilent. Ashley Judd, whose comments about an unnamed studio executive hadfeatured echoes of McGowan’s and Gutierrez’s claims—a meeting moved from a hotelrestaurant to a hotel room, a request that she watch him take a shower—hadn’tresponded to my inquiries.One afternoon that March, I found a quiet stretch of cubicles vacated forrenovations and called Annabella Sciorra. In the preceding weeks, others hadmentioned she might have a story. Sciorra, who was raised in Brooklyn by Italianparents, had made a name for herself in movies like The Hand That Rocks theCradle and later received an Emmy nomination for a guest role on The Sopranos.She had a reputation for playing steely, tough characters, but when she pickedup the phone, her voice sounded small and tired. “It was so strange hearing fromyou,” she said of my Twitter inquiry that had prompted the call. “I wasn’t surewhat it was about. But I’m an MSNBC viewer, you know, so I was happy to talk.”I told her I was working on a story about allegations of sexual harassmentagainst Harvey Weinstein, and that two people had suggested she might havesomething to say.“Oh, that,” she said, managing a tinny laugh. “It’s weird, I’ve heard thatbefore. Who told you that?”I told her I couldn’t reveal other sources without their permission. “It couldhelp a lot of people, if you do know anything,” I said. “Even if you can onlytalk anonymously.”On the other end of the call, Sciorra was in her living room in Brooklyn,staring out at the East River. She hesitated, then said, “No. Nothing happened.”Another thin laugh. “I don’t know. I guess I just wasn’t his type.” I thankedher and told her to call me if she remembered anything. “I wish I could help,”she replied. “I’m sorry.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Early that April, I sat at my desk and looked at a text that had just come in.“Hey…,” it read. “It’s Matthew Hiltzik have a quick question for you.” Hiltzikwas a prominent publicist. He was a reliable choice for news personalities andhad, for years, handled Katie Couric’s communications. When I’d despaired at theflood of tabloid items about me and my family several years earlier, I’d brieflyretained his services at MSNBC’s suggestion, and he’d been compassionate.Hiltzik was an equal-opportunity spin doctor. He was closely entwined with boththe Clinton and Trump families. Ivanka Trump was a client of his firm, and twoof his underlings, Hope Hicks and Josh Raffel, had found roles in Trump’s WhiteHouse.Soon, Hiltzik was calling. “Hey, how are you doing?” he said brightly. There wasa hum of voices in the background, like he was stepping out of a party. “I’m atthis event,” he explained. “Hillary’s speaking.”Hiltzik never called without a reason. I stayed vague about how I was. “Jugglinga few shoots,” I told him. “Dealing with a book deadline.” I’d been spending mynights furiously assembling a long-gestating book about the declining role ofdiplomacy in America’s foreign policy.“So it sounds like your other stories are on the back burner a little,” Hiltzikwas saying. “Like I said, Hillary’s here, and Harvey’s here, who I’ve workedwith over the years.”I said nothing.“He just walked in, actually,” Hiltzik continued. “He said to me, ‘Who’s thisRonan guy? He’s asking questions about me? Is he investigating me?’”“Are you representing him?” I asked.“Not exactly. We have a long relationship. He knows I know you, I said I’d dohim a little favor. I told him, ‘Look, calm down, Harvey, Ronan is a good guy.’I said you and I would have a little chat.”“I investigate a lot of leads and I really can’t talk about any of them untilthey’re ready to go.”“Is this for NBC?” Hiltzik asked.“I mean—I’m an investigative correspondent at NBC.”“Is this about Rose McGowan?” he pressed. “Because he says he can clear thatup.” Choosing my words carefully, I told him I always welcomed information.There was muffled shouting in the background. “He’s so funny,” Hiltzik said.“He’s saying all kinds of”—he paused for effect—“ funny things.”Two hours later, Hiltzik texted, “He is sort of hilarious. Gave your message. Heasked me to call u back.” Then Hiltzik was on the phone again, saying ofWeinstein, “He doesn’t always have a normal reaction,” and, “He’s agitated. He’supset.”“I’m sorry to hear that,” I said.“At times people can be aggressive and try to mess with him by suggestingthere’s even a story here. He says the same stories keep coming back, and theconclusion is always that it’s not true, or not true to the degree peoplethink.” He mentioned that The New Yorker and New York magazine had pursued thestory. One of the reporters had “just called everyone in Harvey’s world. Itfreaked him out.” Weinstein had “gotten more sensitive about it.”“What does ‘sensitive’ mean?” I asked.“He’s older now. He’s mellowed a bit. I don’t think he’s going to be takingaction immediately, but—”“Taking action?” I said.“Well, he’s not dumb. He’s going to do something. Look, you have your book tofinish, right? So this is on the back burner for you,” he said. I glanced at thenotes I’d been taking throughout the call. My eyebrows went up when I saw it:Hiltzik had let slip a small but useful lead.Applause sounded on Hiltzik’s end of the line. “What event are you at?” I asked.Hiltzik explained that Hillary Clinton had finished a greenroom conversationwith Weinstein, her old friend and fund-raiser, then stepped onstage to give aspeech at Women in the World.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]I texted Greenberg about Hiltzik immediately. The next day, Greenberg called. Heled with strained small talk about my foreign policy book that suggested he wasramping up to something. Then, he said, “By the way, I met with Noah today, andyou know—we were talking about ten different things, it wasn’t that we met aboutthis topic, but he asked about your favorite story.” He chuckled. “I told himthere’s smoke but I don’t know that there’s fire. We don’t really have a smokinggun. I said, ‘Noah, if you ask me right now, you know, I don’t think we haveit.’”I reminded him that I’d heard audio of Weinstein admitting to an assault andseen his signature on a million-dollar nondisclosure agreement. I pressed onwhether we could schedule that meeting between Gutierrez and our lawyers. “It’snot in the news. I don’t think there’s any rush here,” Greenberg said. “I thinkwhere we stand now is, we give it a rest.”“What does ‘give it a rest’ mean?” I asked.“You know, just—just keep it on the back burner,” Greenberg said. That phraseagain, I thought. “Ronan, you have so many promising things going on. You’ve gota lot of stories in progress, the series is doing well. You know, you don’t haveto necessarily focus on this.”A few minutes later, I was on the phone with McHugh. He was as puzzled as I was.“This feels like somebody called them,” he said. “You hear from Hiltzik andHarvey, then this? It doesn’t feel like a coincidence.”“I’m sure they got calls, and I’m sure they’re standing up to them. Noah willback this.”“Well, our immediate boss doesn’t want you reporting. You’re gonna have todecide if you go along with that.”“We’ll bring them more evidence, they’ll come around,” I said.But when McHugh told Greenberg he was setting aside an afternoon to make callson the Weinstein story, Greenberg said, simply, “I think that can wait.” Thesituation was creating a Catch-22. We needed more evidence, but continuing togather it openly was, suddenly, a liability. “What happens when we need to shootmore interviews?” McHugh asked.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]“We’re in fantastic shape here,” Alan Berger, of Creative Artists Agency—CAA—wassaying. The San Andreas fault could split open and Los Angeles could slip rightinto the Pacific and agents would still be running around reassuring clients howfantastic everything was. “Your Nightly story about the prisons. Phew!” Bergercontinued. He had a warm, avuncular voice, with an accent that knew its wayaround the Long Island Expressway. He was regarded in the business as a steadydealmaker.“You know your contract’s up this fall.”“I know,” I said. I was in my apartment. In the ballet studio across the street,someone was buffing the floor. As the Weinstein story expanded, it crowded outother reporting and career considerations. I’d missed so many deadlines on myforeign policy book that my publisher had finally given up and canceled it, thatvery week.“They love you there,” Berger said, of NBC. “Noah loves you. Everyone sees abigger role for you.”“Well, I’m working on some stories that are making things a little—”“A little what, Ronan?”“I can’t talk about it, Alan. Just let me know if anything seems weird.”“Ronan, you’re killing me,” Berger said, laughing. “Just keep doing what you’redoing. And don’t piss anyone off.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter013]DICK [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter013]I flipped through my notes from the call with Hiltzik and looked at his commentabout New York and The New Yorker magazines. At New York, Carr, with hissuspicions of surveillance and intimidation, had chased the story, but that wasin the early 2000s. Something in Hiltzik’s observation about Weinstein’ssensitivity suggested someone else had tried more recently.I sent another message to Jennifer Senior, the writer who’d worked with Carr.“Can you find out if anyone else at New York was working on the story wediscussed, potentially more recently than David?” I asked. “I keep hearing thatthis might have been the case.”“Yr right,” she wrote back. “Just looked at my email. But I feel uncomfortable,in this case, saying who.” The attempt at the story, it seemed, had endedpoorly. I asked her to pass on a message to the mystery writer.At The New Yorker, Ken Auletta, a writer known for his thorough appraisals ofbusiness and media executives, had profiled Weinstein in 2002. Entitled “Beautyand the Beast,” the piece made no explicit mention of sexual predation, butdwelled on Weinstein’s brutality. He was, Auletta wrote, “spectacularly coarse,and even threatening.” And there was a curious, overheated passage that hintedthat there was more to the story. Auletta noted that Weinstein’s businesspartners “feel ‘raped’—a word often invoked by those dealing with him.” I sent amessage to an acquaintance who worked at The New Yorker and asked for Auletta’semail address.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Auletta was seventy-five. He grew up on Coney Island, raised by a Jewish motherand an Italian father. There was something elegant and old-world about hiscarriage and speech. And he was a careful, experienced reporter. “Of course,there was more to it than we were able to print,” he told me when I called him,from an empty office near the investigative newsroom. Back in 2002, Auletta hadpursued the claims that Weinstein was preying on women, and even asked about theallegations in an on-the-record interview. The two had been sitting inWeinstein’s Tribeca offices. Weinstein stood up, face red, and shouted atAuletta, “Are you trying to get my fucking wife to divorce me?” Auletta stood,too, “fully prepared to beat the shit out of him.” But then Weinstein crumpled,sitting back down and beginning to sob. “He basically said to me, ‘Look I don’talways behave well, but I love my wife.’” Weinstein hadn’t denied theallegations.Auletta hadn’t been able to secure an on-the-record claim like McGowan’s, or apiece of hard evidence like Gutierrez’s tape and contract. But he had spoken toZelda Perkins, an employee of Miramax in London who, alongside a colleague namedRowena Chiu, was involved in a joint sexual harassment settlement withWeinstein. Though Perkins had been too frightened to go on the record, Aulettawas able to use her account as leverage, compelling Weinstein to concede therehad been some kind of settlement in London with her and Chiu. Weinstein evenpresented to The New Yorker the voided check used in the transaction, toestablish that it had been underwritten not by Miramax’s parent company, Disney,but with private money from an account belonging to Weinstein’s brother, Bob.But the checks had been shown to him off the record. When the brothers, alongwith David Boies, met with Auletta and New Yorker editor David Remnick,Weinstein had provided none of the further information they’d hoped might renderthe claims publishable. He’d evinced only furious denials and a barely checkedtemper.Years later, Auletta’s frustration was still palpable. He was like a homicidedetective kept awake at night by the case that got away. “I had a fixation,” hetold me. By the end of his reporting, he said, “I came to believe that he’s apredator, a serial rapist, and to see exposing him as a public service.” He hadtried reviving the story twice over the years, most recently after the Gutierrezincident. But he’d gotten no traction. “If you have any chance of succeedingwhere I failed,” he told me, “keep at it.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Rose McGowan had stayed in touch, urging us to come shoot more with her. Shementioned, in our conversations, that she was finding more support. Lacy Lynch,the literary agent who had passed along the inquiry from Seth Freedman, theempathetic former Guardian writer, was also forwarding other expressions ofsolidarity. The day I spoke to Auletta, one such email arrived, from ReubenCapital Partners, a London-based wealth management firm seeking to enlistMcGowan in a charitable project called Women in Focus. The firm was planning agala dinner at the end of the year and hoped McGowan would give a keynotespeech: “We have taken a keen interest in the work Ms Rose McGowan does for theadvocacy of women’s rights and we believe that the ideals she strives towardsalign closely with those upheld by our new initiative.”“I think it sounds good,” Lynch wrote to McGowan. “Would love to set up a callto learn more.”The email from Reuben Capital Partners was signed by Diana Filip, deputy head ofsustainable and responsible investments.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The following morning, an email that I obtained many months later appeared inHarvey Weinstein’s private Gmail account. “RF Info,” the subject line read.“LEGALLY PRIVILEGED.”“Harvey,” the email read, “Here is a rough overview of the info I have compiledso far on Ronan Farrow.” Several dozen exhibits were attached. In a section ofthe email titled “persons of interest that Farrow is following” was a list ofsome accusers I’d found, and some I hadn’t. The email noted that McHugh and Ihad followed, on social media, a cluster of McGowan’s associates around the dateof our interview, “out of the blue,” and speculated that I’d gotten her to talk.It observed that I was “a fan” of Lisa Bloom, appearing to assess her level ofaccess to me. And it described my attempts to get in touch with Judd, Sciorra,and Arquette. The email analyzed the likelihood that each of them would talk. Itflagged any public statements the women had made about sexual violence as awarning sign.A section titled “Farrow Employment” contained an exhaustive list of coworkerswho might provide access or information. There were the obvious on-airinvestigative correspondents with whom I’d worked, like Cynthia McFadden andStephanie Gosk. But the list also included coworkers who wouldn’t be publiclyidentifiable, like an NBC intern whose desk was adjacent to mine.A biographical section appeared to search for pressure points. It noted what itdescribed as “family drama,” stirred by “his sister Dylan Farrow in heraccusations of rape against their father Woody Allen.” The topic I’d spent yearstrying to outrun was coming back to haunt me.The email was sent by Sara Ness, a private investigator at a firm called PSOPS.Jack Palladino and Sandra Sutherland, a husband-and-wife team, operated thefirm. A rare profile of the two in People magazine compared them to Nick andNora Charles, the detective couple from The Thin Man, minus the glamour. Duringthe 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton hired Palladino to “discreditstories about women claiming to have had relationships with the Arkansasgovernor,” per the Washington Post. By the late nineties, Palladino had earnedthe nickname “the President’s Dick.” He said he never broke the law. But, heproudly noted, “I go right to the boundaries of the envelope.”“Jack is overseas, but I have kept him up to speed on this investigation andwill confer with him this week on the issues/potential strategies you and Idiscussed yesterday,” Ness wrote Weinstein that day in April. She promised thata fuller and more formal dossier was forthcoming. The message made two thingsclear: that the research was meant to complement a larger effort, involvingplayers other than Palladino’s firm; and that the dossier was just an openingsalvo.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Rich McHugh and I kept raising the idea of doing further reporting on theWeinstein story, and Greenberg kept telling us to focus on other things.Greenberg was our boss. The conversations were becoming awkward. But after thecall with Auletta, it was becoming clear that we had secured more hard evidencethan anyone had before, about a story that had stayed buried for decades.“What do we do?” I asked McHugh. We were huddled on the margins of the newsroom.“I don’t know,” he replied. “I think if you go to Greenberg—he told you to putthe story on the back burner…”“He didn’t order us to stop,” I said, wearily. “He said we could meet againabout it.”“Okay,” McHugh said, skeptical.“But maybe it’s strategic to be armed with as much as possible before thatmeeting,” I conceded.“That’s my inclination,” he said. “Let’s just get on with it.”We agreed to shore up our reporting. We’d return with a bulletproof body ofevidence, and ask for forgiveness, not permission. Calls could be done quietly.But we debated how to keep our on-camera interviews going without running afoulof Greenberg.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The next day, McHugh motioned me over to his computer. “We have a green light onshooting for, what, three, four stories?” We were working on several aboutaddiction, and the one about Dow Chemical and Shell seeding California farmlandswith toxic waste. “You think you can schedule these Weinstein interviews aroundthose shoots?” he asked.“Well, yeah. But they’d be marked as Weinstein interviews anyway,” I said.“Not necessarily,” he said. “We add interviews that come up suddenly ontoexisting travel all the time. And we can label them anything we want.”There were limits to how much we could hide the work. The subject of any newinterviews would still be revealed on detailed expense reports. But we couldavoid calling attention to the matter with leadership.On his monitor, McHugh navigated to a networked drive on an NBC server. Hescrolled through a list of directories containing our stories. Then he took theWeinstein files out of a folder titled “MEDIA MOGUL” and dropped them into adifferent one. I looked at the screen and laughed. The folder he’d chosen, namedafter the California waste story, was labeled “POISON VALLEY.”"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Art_P89.jpg]toc.xhtml#toc-part002"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter014]ROOKIE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter014]The men sat at Harvey Weinstein’s usual table near the kitchen in the back ofthe Tribeca Grill. It was April 24. Weinstein was there, and Dylan Howard, ofthe National Enquirer, and an operative from Black Cube. The operative lookedyoung, with dark hair and a heavy accent.Lanny Davis walked in and surveyed the room. Davis was by then in his earlyseventies, a thin man with graying hair and bags under his eyes. He was raisedin Jersey City, his father a dentist, his mother a manager in the dental office.At Yale Law School, Davis had become friends with Hillary Rodham and, later,Bill Clinton. After a failed run for Congress and a few years of legal practice,he’d spun this friendship into a professional role as their most ardent defenderin times of scandal and political peril.Then Davis cashed in, taking on jobs that earned him $1 million to lobby his wayaround Equatorial Guinea’s human rights abuses, or $100,000 a month to downplaya patently rigged election in Ivory Coast. If a passenger disappeared and left asmear of blood on the deck of your cruise ship, or the President criticized yourfootball team’s racist name, Davis was there. Trying to get ahold of Davis lateron, I asked Jonathan, “Who would have Lanny Davis’s number?” He replied, “Idon’t know, Pol Pot?”Weinstein—who had met Davis at an event honoring Hillary Clinton and knew of thecrisis manager’s familiarity with the sexual misconduct allegations against BillClinton—had called that spring to enlist him.At the Tribeca Grill that morning, Davis said they couldn’t talk in front of theBlack Cube operative if Weinstein wanted to maintain attorney-client privilege.“I can’t talk in front of people who aren’t attorneys,” Davis said. “If I’msubpoenaed, I have to tell if someone else is in the room.”Weinstein seemed annoyed by this.“Oh, yes, you can,” he said. “You can maintain privilege if he works for me.”This was an oversimplification of the law. But Weinstein was insistent, andDavis relented.Weinstein ranted. McGowan, he said, was crazy, a liar. He wanted to discreditall the women making what he described as false claims about him.“My advice is don’t do that,” Davis told Weinstein. “Even if you think you’reright.”Weinstein began to bellow. “Why? Why? Why? Why?”“Because it looks awful,” Davis said.Dylan Howard grinned, which he did a lot. The man from Black Cube did not. A fewhours after the meeting at the Tribeca Grill, Dr. Avi Yanus, Black Cube’sdirector and CFO, sent an email to Weinstein’s attorneys at Boies SchillerFlexner, calling the meeting “productive.” He wrote that Weinstein had agreed toa ten-week extension of Black Cube’s operation on his behalf. An invoice wasattached. The email continued: “We are committed as ever to bring you withgame-changing intelligence in this case, and to successfully reach all of ourmain objectives.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]I scoured Auletta’s old profile of Weinstein for sources that might lead me tothe two settlements in London, calling one after another. Donna Gigliotti, theShakespeare in Love producer, had discouraged me when we first spoke. But when Icalled her again, she revealed more. “There are documents out there,” she said.“Where he’s never admitting guilt, but large sums of money are paid. You needthose documents. But the victims are never allowed to keep them.” I asked her ifshe meant, for example, documents related to two women with complaints inLondon. “If you find them,” she said, “maybe I can talk. Until then, I’m afraidI can’t.” She did, however, give me the names of several other former employeeswho had been in the London offices in the same era and might help.I thanked her. She was not optimistic. “Nothing’s stopping Harvey,” she told me.“He will squash this story.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Celebrities hurried out of SUVs, bowed their heads into heavy rain, and filedinto Time magazine’s annual gala dinner celebrating its “100 most influentialpeople” list. I was not on the list. I was, however, soaked.“I’m an aquarium,” I said, walking into the Time Warner Center. “I’m the plot ofChinatown.”My mother shrugged. “Wet’s always in. It’s classic.”The event was heavy on television news figures. I blundered through awkwardconversations with them. Megyn Kelly, tony and sequined and charismatic in a waythat made you feel you were the only person in the room, mentioned herforthcoming NBC show. I congratulated her, then said I was sorry about “theTwitter thing.” I quickly realized my gaffe. Kelly had departed Fox News tailedby supercut videos of her saying things that were, depending on whom you asked,either clumsy or malicious about people of color. “The Twitter thing” was thatI’d called a comment of hers racist. A tendon stood out on Kelly’s neck. “I madea lot of mistakes when I was at your point in my career, too,” she said, smilingtightly. “You’re kind of a rookie reporter.”I stalked off, moistly, to find a bathroom or a drink or anything but moreconversation, and instead found Andy Lack. As we shook hands, he looked at melike he was processing something. Lack had tufts of graying hair and an affablebut appraising smile. At almost seventy, he had enjoyed an eclectic career, witha through line of creative showmanship. Like Oppenheim, he’d dreamed ofHollywood. He’d studied acting at Boston University and, after graduating,landed roles in a Broadway production of Inquest, a play about Julius and EthelRosenberg, and in a few commercials. “He was charming, charismatic,” one personclose to Lack later told me. “His background in theater makes him a uniquecreative mind.” At CBS News in the eighties, his signature achievement was West57th, an edgy and stylish spin on the classic newsmagazine format. During hisfirst stint as an NBC News executive in the nineties, he’d been credited with aturnaround in a time of disarray and declining ratings. Positions at Sony Musicand Bloomberg Television had followed. In 2015, NBC had brought him back toright the ship again.Lack was still giving me that searching look.“Ronan,” I said quickly.“Yes,” he said, finally, as if dredging something heavy up from the bottom of adeep body of water. “Yes, of course.”He said Oppenheim talked about me a lot. I thanked him for getting behindinvestigative stories. I reached for a personal connection. My brother hadrecently purchased Lack’s home in Bronxville, New York.“Apparently you left behind a giant safe they still haven’t drilled open,” Isaid.Lack laughed. “That’s true. There is an old safe.” He said the safe had precededhim, and he hadn’t opened it, either. He shrugged. “Sometimes it’s better toleave things be.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The room began to thin, guests filtering into an adjacent amphitheater fordinner. I found my mother, headed in the same direction. Oppenheim approachedus. “That’s Noah,” I whispered to my mother. “Tell him you liked Jackie.”“But I didn’t like Jackie,” she said.I shot her a withering look.They said their hellos and then Oppenheim pulled me aside.“So Harvey’s here,” he said. “He’s sitting with me at dinner.”I stared at him. I’d been keeping him apprised of every element of thereporting. “You do know I’ve heard a recording of him admitting to a sexualassault,” I said.Oppenheim raised both hands in a defensive gesture. “I believe you!” he said.“It’s not about believing…,” I trailed off. “Don’t mention anything, obviously.”“Of course,” he said.A moment later, I watched as Oppenheim stood at the entrance to theamphitheater, talking to a hulking figure in a baggy black tuxedo. HarveyWeinstein was recovering from knee surgery, leaning on a cane.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The first week of May, Black Cube called Weinstein with a promising update. “Weinformed the client that following our intense efforts, we scheduled a meetingin LA next week, which we believe will lead to the disclosure of high qualityintelligence and hard evidence for the purposes of our work,” Yanus, the BlackCube director, wrote to Weinstein’s lawyers at Boies Schiller. This new phase ofthe project would require a new cash injection as well. A few days later, on May12, Christopher Boies, David Boies’s son and a partner at his firm, oversaw thewiring of another $50,000 to Black Cube.In the preceding days, Lynch, the agent advising Rose McGowan, had brokered theproposed introduction between McGowan and Diana Filip of Reuben CapitalPartners, who had reached out to enlist McGowan in her Women in Focus campaign.“Rose, it’s a great pleasure to connect with you,” Filip wrote.“It is my great pleasure to connect with you as well,” McGowan replied.The day Boies Schiller’s latest payment appeared in Black Cube’s account, Filipand McGowan finally met face-to-face, at the Belvedere, the airy, pastel-coloredMediterranean restaurant at the Peninsula hotel in Beverly Hills. Filip had highcheekbones, a prominent nose, and dirty-blond hair. She had an elegant accentMcGowan couldn’t place. McGowan was skeptical of strangers. But Filip seemed toknow everything about her, and, more than that, to understand her. The actresslet her guard down, just a little."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter015]STATIC [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter015]Jennifer Senior made good on her promise and introduced me to Ben Wallace, theNew York magazine writer behind that publication’s most recent attempt at theWeinstein story. One afternoon that May, I called him as I left RockefellerPlaza. Wallace told me how frustrating the assignment had been. Anything helearned seemed immediately, inexplicably, to get back to Weinstein. “Everyonewas a double agent,” Wallace told me.This seemed to be especially true of several sources who had offered to help.He’d suspected that Anna, the European woman who told him she had a story aboutWeinstein, was hiding something. Some of her questions had felt strange. Annawanted to know not just how many other sources he was working with but who theywere. The information she seemed bent on extracting was out of proportion towhat she was giving. At times, she appeared to press him to make statements thatbetrayed bias. At the hotel bar, when she eventually broke down and recountedher story about Weinstein, it was mild and generalized. She said she andWeinstein had an affair that ended poorly. She wanted revenge. The performancehad a soap-operatic quality. As she dangled her wrist in front of him, Wallacehad a prickly suspicion that she might be secretly recording. He told Anna thathe sympathized but considered consensual affairs to be Weinstein’s own business.Then he left the hotel bar and stopped taking her calls.Wallace had the same feeling that something was off when he received the emailfrom Seth Freedman, the former writer for the Guardian who wanted to help.Freedman wrote that he was “working with a group of international journalists ona large story about the film industry, giving a sense of the present-day cultureof Hollywood and other film capitals.” He claimed to have “come across a greatdeal of information that we can’t include in our pieces, which might be of useto you. I would be very happy to share it with you if you are interested.” Butafter several conversations with Freedman, Wallace still hadn’t gotten anymeaningful information out of him. “He was pumping me for what I had heard andlearned,” Wallace recalled. Suspicious, he cut ties there, too.Weinstein’s associates started calling New York magazine, sometimes threateningto deliver unspecified personal information about Wallace. Weinstein demanded ameeting between his legal team, investigators from Kroll, and the magazine. Theintention, Wallace assumed, was to “come in with dossiers slagging various womenand me.” The magazine declined the meeting. In January of 2017, after threemonths of reporting, Wallace and his editor, Adam Moss, decided to stand down.“At a certain point,” Wallace told me, “the magazine just couldn’t afford tospend indefinite time.”The experience had clearly put him on edge. As Weinstein and his team begancalling New York with an uncanny knowledge of his leads, Wallace purchased apaper shredder and destroyed his notes. “I was more paranoid than ever before,”he told me. “There was much more static and distraction than I’ve encountered onany other story.”Wallace hadn’t gotten any sources on the record or discovered dispositivedocuments or recordings. But he had assembled a list of women with allegations.He rattled off a few names I had heard myself, including that of Asia Argento,the Italian actress whom several former Weinstein colleagues had suggested Ifind. There were also a few sources he had gotten to speak on background,telling their full stories but with their identities obscured—including a formerassistant who had been harassed by Weinstein and complained to HR at hiscompany.“Please,” I said. “Just ask her if she’d talk.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]In the glass that separated the investigative bullpen and the fourth-floorstudio, I sometimes caught glimpses of my reflection. That spring, I’d filledout a little, and gotten some color from all the shooting in Los Angeles. Therewas a feeling of momentum around McHugh and me and our little investigativeseries. We were receiving the kind of television journalism awards you neverhear of in the outside world and enthusiastic appraisals in outlets that covermedia. The head of communications at NBC News, Mark Kornblau, had also worked atthe State Department during my time there. Over coffee as I transitioned from myrole at MSNBC to the network, and in our encounters since, he’d been supportive.Kornblau and his team nurtured the positive coverage, giving quotes or allowingme to do so.The mood seemed to extend to others. An NBC veteran named David Corvo stopped mein the hall. Corvo was the executive producer of Dateline. A small, animated manwith a bushy beard, he’d been working at NBC since the mid-nineties. He wasclose with Lack. “Let’s get together,” Corvo said. “You’re doing exactly thekind of stories we want.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]It was early evening when Ambra Gutierrez and I sat down at a quiet restaurantin the theater district called Brazil Brazil. I’d spent the previous monthtrying to find another way to obtain the recording. Police sources told me thatthey believed Gutierrez. They were convinced they’d had the evidence they neededto charge Weinstein, despite the DA’s decision not to. But none of theconversations had gotten me any closer to the recording.With Gutierrez, I had tried on for size every possible approach that might allowher to pass me her copy. What if she left and went to the bathroom, and I justhappened to have access to the computer? No, she said. She stood to lose toomuch. She was worried about her brother. “I have to get him here, fromPhilippines,” she said. Gutierrez was sounding increasingly skittish.It was Jonathan who, the night before, had suggested another feint towardplausible deniability.“What if you record her recording. Literally hold a microphone to a speaker. Youmake something new. She never transfers anything.”“What does that do?”“It just feels like a step removed, no files ever change hands. Forget it. It’sdumb.”“Wait, it might be good.”“It’s so good.”I laughed.Besides, I didn’t have a better idea. In the restaurant with Gutierrez, I leanedin and made the last-ditch proposal. “There’s no digital paper trail. There’s noflash drive to uncover. And I have a file that didn’t come from your harddrive.”She drew a deep breath. I sat back, watching her, thinking there was no way onearth this would work.“Maybe,” she said. She pulled the old MacBook from her bag. “Okay, maybe isworth a try.”I felt a wash of adrenaline. We both knew the cover would be thin. She wastaking a risk.I thanked her. She nodded and opened the laptop, and I pulled out my phone.“Wait,” she said. “We have problem.”The old MacBook, it came to pass, had no working speakers. I leaned in again,speaking fast. “Ambra, if I go get us an external speaker, will you be here whenI get back?”She glanced around, gave me an uncertain look.“Just give me twenty minutes,” I said.I sprinted from the restaurant and into the crush of West Forty-Sixth Street.Where to go? There would probably be a place with electronics among the smalltourist shops that sell “I Love New York” hats on Broadway, but I didn’t knowexactly where to look. I took out my phone, found the nearest big-boxelectronics store. It was farther, but a surer thing. I shoved through thepre-theater crowd, got to the corner, waved a hand frantically at oncoming cabs.By the time I limped into the store, I was drenched in sweat. I hurried down anescalator and all but screeched to a halt in front of a shelf of what lookedlike several thousand speakers.“Hi, can I help you?” a clerk asked.“I need a speaker,” I gasped.“Well, sir, we’ve got you covered,” he said brightly. “We’ve got your Bluetooth,your Wi-Fi, your USB. You looking for something Alexa-activated? This one’s gota little LED light show.” I stared at him crazily. Fifteen minutes later I wasrunning back into the restaurant, four different overpriced speakers janglingagainst one another. Gutierrez was still there. She shot me a nervous smile.In a garden behind the restaurant, I unboxed one of the speakers. The Bluetoothon the old Mac, mercifully, worked. We agreed that she would play the middle ofthe three files: anything that replicated the breaks between sections wouldbetray that it had derived from her phone copy rather than the presumablyunbroken one taken from her police wire. She drew a deep breath and said, “Ihope the other girls get justice.” We huddled over the laptop. She hit Play andI captured two minutes of a terrified woman struggling to get away from a hotelsuite, and a brutal man not taking no for an answer. “Just come on in,” I heardhim say again. “I’m used to that.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]I needed advice. The next day, I knocked on Tom Brokaw’s office door on thefifth floor of 30 Rock. In my earliest months at NBC, Brokaw had approached meas we stood on line for coffee at a shop in the building’s basement concourse.He’d seen my show, he said. He thought I was trying to do something smarter thanusual for the format.“Thank you, sir,” I’d said. “Means a lot coming from you.”“Tom, please,” he’d responded. “We’re not headmaster and head boy here.”He accepted my invitations to appear on air with me more often than he had to,and his commentary was always eloquent and full of historical insight.Brokaw was in his late seventies then. A few years earlier, he’d been diagnosedwith blood cancer. That day in May, he pottered around his office, showed mepictures of Meredith, his wife of more than fifty years, and told a few storiesabout old Hollywood.“So what can I do for you?” he said finally.I told him I was working on a sensitive story, and that I was concerned that itwasn’t being elevated in the way it needed to be. I mentioned Greenberg’s “backburner” comments.“I know Noah will get behind it,” I said. “I’m just worried about interferencebefore it gets there.”“Well, you have to stick to your guns, Ronan,” he said. “If you back down,you’ll fuck your credibility.” I laughed. Brokaw said he thought it was a goodidea to shore up all the additional leads I could before taking it back to thepowers that be. He said he’d call Andy Lack and Noah Oppenheim when I did so.“Who’s it about, by the way?” he said finally.I hesitated for a moment then told him it was Weinstein. The warmth drained outof the room. “I see,” he said. “Well, I have to disclose, Ronan, that HarveyWeinstein is a friend.”The two had connected when Brokaw was soliciting advice on a documentary aboutveterans, he said. Weinstein had been good to him.Shit, I thought. Is anyone not friends with this guy?“I assume I can still count on your confidence,” I said to Brokaw.“You can,” he said. He showed me out of the office, seeming troubled.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]As I stepped out, my phone rang. It was Lisa Bloom. “Hey!” she said brightly,and then proceeded to make small talk about a model she was representing who hadbeen a victim of revenge porn. “We should get together and talk,” Bloom said. “Icould get you an interview with her.”“Sure,” I said, distracted.“By the way, are you still working on that story about NDAs?”Bloom had said she was acquainted with Weinstein and his team—and, sure, she wasattentive to her brand, and didn’t hate a press conference—but she had moralfiber I felt I could trust. Besides, she was a lawyer. Respecting confidenceswas the bedrock of our profession.“I am,” I said, after a beat.“So it’s going forward,” she said.“I—I’m working on it.”“Have you seen any of the nondisclosure agreements?”I paused again. “I’m aware of some specific agreements, yes.”“How many women are you talking to? Can you tell me who they are?” she asked. “Imay be able to help get you information, if you can share who you’re talkingto.”“I can’t talk about specific sources,” I said. “But there’s a group, and it’sgrowing. And if you have any advice on what I should be doing to insulate themfrom liability, I welcome it.”“Absolutely,” she said.When I checked my phone after we hung up, I saw I’d missed another volley ofInstagram messages from the same mysterious handle. This time, the final messagewas a photograph of a pistol. One of the messages read, “Sometimes you have tohurt the things you love.” I took a handful of screenshots and made a note tomyself to find out whom to talk to at NBC about security."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter016]F.O.H. [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter016]The next time my phone chimed, it was happier news. Ben Wallace, from New Yorkmagazine, was following up. The former assistant he hadn’t quite managed to geton the record would talk to me.The following week, in the closing days of May, I walked into the lobby of aBeverly Hills hotel. I hadn’t looked up what the source looked like, but Irecognized her quickly. She was slender and blond and striking. She cracked anervous grin. “Hey!” she said. “I’m Emily.”Emily Nestor was in her late twenties and held law and business degrees fromPepperdine. She was working for a tech startup but seemed to be searching forsomething more purposeful. She talked about wanting to work in education, maybesomething with underprivileged kids. A few years earlier, she’d harboredambitions in the film business, hoping to produce and perhaps someday run astudio. But an experience she’d had as a temporary assistant had shaken herbelief in the business. The casual, practiced nature of the harassment had madeher worry it was a pattern. And the response when she reported it had left herdisillusioned.I laid out what we had: McGowan and Gutierrez named in the story, and the audio,and the growing number of executives on camera. I was transparent about howprecarious it all was, too.Nestor still looked scared as she told me she’d think about it. She wasfrightened of retaliation. But I could tell that she was too fierce in herconvictions to shy away.A few days later, she was in. She’d go on camera, though she wanted to beunnamed and in shadow to start out, then see how she felt about going further.And she had evidence: messages from Irwin Reiter, a senior executive who hadworked for Weinstein for almost three decades, acknowledging the incident andalluding to its being part of a pattern of predation inside the company. A thirdwoman, and more hard evidence: it felt like the threshold we’d been waiting for.“Once we bring him this,” I told McHugh, “Noah will make sure it gets on air.He’ll have to.”Back home in New York, at a gala dinner at the Museum of the Moving Image, NewYork media elites assembled to honor Lester Holt and Roy Price, the head ofAmazon Studios. Jeffrey Tambor, the actor, who was at the time appearing inAmazon’s Transparent, toasted Price. Noah Oppenheim did the honors for Holt,praising his unflinching coverage of tough stories. Then he returned to his seatat NBC’s table alongside David Corvo, the Dateline producer. Nearby, at Amazon’stable, Harvey Weinstein applauded.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Not long after, Nestor, McHugh, and I sat in a hotel room overlooking aglittering marina in Santa Monica. We were still tiptoeing around our shoots onthe story, making the case bulletproof before we triggered a conversation withour bosses. We had set the date for Nestor’s interview around the margins of atrip to California’s Central Valley for the pollutants story.As we backlit her and her face deepened into shadow, Nestor said she anticipateda “personal and vengeful” response from Weinstein when he saw the story. InDecember 2014, when she was twenty-five, Nestor had worked as a temporary frontdesk assistant at the Weinstein Company in Los Angeles. She was overqualified,but took the job on a lark to get a firsthand view of the entertainmentindustry. On her first day, Nestor said, two employees told her that she wasWeinstein’s “type” physically. When Weinstein arrived at the office, he madecomments about her appearance, referring to her as “the pretty girl.” He askedhow old she was, and then sent his assistants out of the room and made her writedown her telephone number.Weinstein told her to meet him for drinks that night. Nestor invented an excuse.When he insisted, she suggested an early-morning coffee the next day, assumingthat he wouldn’t accept. He told her to meet him at the Peninsula hotel, one ofhis favorite haunts. Friends in the entertainment industry and employees in thecompany had by then warned her about Weinstein’s reputation. “I dressed veryfrumpy,” she recalled.At the meeting, Weinstein offered her career help, then began to boast about hissexual liaisons with other women, including famous actresses. “He said, ‘Youknow, we could have a lot of fun,’” Nestor recalled. “‘I could put you in myLondon office, and you could work there and you could be my girlfriend.’” Shedeclined. He asked to hold her hand; she said no. She recalled Weinsteinremarking, “Oh, the girls always say no. You know, ‘No, no.’ And then they havea beer or two and then they’re throwing themselves at me.” In a tone that Nestordescribed as “very weirdly proud,” Weinstein added “that he’d never had to doanything like Bill Cosby.” She assumed that he meant he’d never drugged a woman.“Textbook sexual harassment” was how Nestor described Weinstein’s behavior. Sherecalled refusing his advances at least a dozen times. “‘No’ did not mean ‘no’to him,” she said.Throughout the meeting, Weinstein interrupted their conversation to yell intohis cell phone, screaming at, of all people, Today show management, enraged thatthey’d canceled a segment with Amy Adams, a star in the Weinstein movie BigEyes, when she refused to answer questions about a recent hack targeting Sonyexecutives. Afterward, Weinstein told Nestor to keep an eye on the news cycle,which he promised would be spun in his favor and against NBC. Later in the day,items critical of NBC’s role in the spat surfaced as promised. Weinstein stoppedby Nestor’s desk to make sure that she’d seen them.Nestor found the ferocity with which Weinstein moved to intimidate a newsorganization unsettling. By that point, she recalled, “I was very afraid of him.And I knew how well-connected he was. And how if I pissed him off then I couldnever have a career in that industry.” Still, she told a friend about theincident, and he alerted the company’s office of human resources. Nestor had aconversation with company officials about the matter but didn’t pursue itfurther after they told her that Weinstein would be informed of anything shetold them. Later, employee after employee would tell me the human resourcesoffice at the company was a sham, a place where complaints went to die.Irwin Reiter, the Weinstein Company’s executive vice president of accounting andfinancial reporting, had reached out to Nestor via LinkedIn. “We view this veryseriously and I personally am very sorry your first day was like this,” Reiterwrote. “Also if there are further unwanted advances, please let us know.” Inlate 2016, just before the presidential election, he’d reached out again,writing, “All this Trump stuff made me think of you.” He described Nestor’sexperience as part of Weinstein’s serial misconduct. “I’ve fought him aboutmistreatment of women 3 weeks before the incident with you. I even wrote him anemail that got me labelled by him as sex police,” he wrote. “The fight I hadwith him about you was epic. I told him if you were my daughter he would havenot made out so well.” Nestor gave me the messages and, eventually, permissionto air them.Nestor left after completing her temporary placement, feeling traumatized. “Iactually decided not to go into entertainment because of this incident,” shetold me. Behind her, the sun was setting over the marina. “Is this the way theworld works?” she wondered. “That men get away with this?”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]As McHugh and I sweated our way through interviews with toxicologists, localofficials, and residents exposed to toxic waste in the Central Valley, thenumber of Miramax and Weinstein Company sources willing to talk grew. At a barin West Hollywood, I met with one former employee who’d worked with Weinsteinclosely. She said that Weinstein’s predation had become enmeshed with hisprofessional life. He would ask her to join for the beginning of meetings withyoung women that, in many cases, had already been moved from day to night andfrom hotel lobbies to hotel rooms. She said that Weinstein’s conduct was brazen.During a meeting with a model, he’d demanded, “Tell her how good of a boyfriendI am.” She said that when she refused to join the meetings with women, Weinsteinwould sometimes fly into a terrifying rage. Once, they’d been in a limo, andhe’d opened the door and slammed it shut again and again, face contorted andbeet-red, shouting, “Fuck you! You were my cover!”Weinstein had assistants keep track of the women. The former employee had themall filed under the same label in her phone: “F.O.H.,” which stood for “Friendof Harvey.” “He’s been systematically doing this for a very long time,” she toldme.She took out an iPhone and navigated to a sentence she’d jotted down in herNotes app a few years earlier. It was something Weinstein whispered—to himself,as far as she could tell—after one of his many shouting sprees. It so unnervedher that she pulled out her phone and tapped it into a memo, word for word:“There are things I’ve done that nobody knows.”That former employee put me on the trail of a handful of others. As June turnedinto July, they began to go on camera. “There was a large volume of these typesof meetings that Harvey would have with aspiring actresses and models,” a formerexecutive named Abby Ex told me, her face in shadow, as cameras rolled in aBeverly Hills hotel room. “He would have them late at night, usually at hotelbars or in hotel rooms. And, in order to make these women feel more comfortable,he would ask a female executive or assistant to start those meetings with him.”She said she refused Weinstein’s demands that she join such meetings, butwatched some of them play out, and witnessed, first-hand, a wider pattern ofphysical and verbal abuse.Ex told me that her lawyer advised her that she could be liable for hundreds ofthousands of dollars in damages for violating the nondisclosure agreementattached to her employment contract. But, she said, “I believe this is moreimportant than keeping a confidentiality agreement.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]After the interviews, I arrived back at Jonathan’s place and sat at his kitchentable, poring over transcripts. He padded out in a science-themed tee shirt withan astronaut on it.“Did you eat?” he asked.“No,” I replied, still staring at the screen.“Let’s go somewhere healthy or disgusting.”“Can’t,” I said. It occurred to me that it had been a while since we’d doneanything together. I took off my glasses, rubbed my eyes. “Sorry. I’m a lot todeal with right now, I know.”He took a seat at the table next to me. “Yeah, all of our conversations areabout sexual harassment now. It’s a blast.”My phone pinged. It was a text notification. Type “Yes” to receive weatheralerts, it said. I stared at it, confused. This was Los Angeles, weather didn’texist here.“You’re texting!” Jonathan was saying. “Hope he’s worth it! Hope he’s worthsaying goodbye to all of this!”“Definitely,” I said, and swiped the message away."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter017]666 [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter017]As Harvey Weinstein’s former employees talked to me, Harvey Weinstein talked toBlack Cube. On June 6, its operatives met with Weinstein and his lawyers atBoies Schiller in New York and delivered an exuberant update. After the meeting,Yanus, the director, checked in with Christopher Boies. “It’s been a greatpleasure meeting with you and your client today and to present you with ourfinal report,” Yanus wrote. “We have been able to successfully achieve theproject’s objectives and meet all three success fee clauses… the most importantof which is to identify who stands behind the negative campaign against theclient.” He attached an invoice for $600,000. The contract with Black Cubestipulated that the “success fees” Yanus mentioned be paid in the event thatWeinstein used the fruit of Black Cube’s labors in litigation or in the media;or should Black Cube “succeed in putting a stop to the negative campaign”against Weinstein; or should its operatives discover the “individual or entitybehind” that campaign.A week later, Yanus checked in again: “Good morning Chris, I was wondering ifyou could give us an update about the status of the payment.” This didn’t get aresponse, either. On June 18, Weinstein met with Black Cube in London and, byYanus’s description in a peevish email sent to Boies shortly afterward,“thoroughly reviewed our findings again and discussed possible future steps tosupport your client’s case, who has again spoken very highly of our work.”As Weinstein sat on the invoice, his rapport with Black Cube strained. Yanuswould call and delicately say, “You haven’t paid us.” On a good day, Weinsteinwould feign ignorance, and get the Weinstein Company’s general counsel on theline. “I didn’t know that,” he’d shout at his company’s lawyer. “Get them paid!”But mostly Weinstein would just shout at Black Cube. “Why am I paying you?You’re supposed to be on this!” he’d say.Things came to a head in conversations in late June. Weinstein questioned ifBlack Cube’s work might have broken the law, leaving him exposed to problemsdown the road. He insisted that the operation “hasn’t solved his problemcompletely,” as a summary email sent by the working-level project manager underYanus explained. Weinstein reminded Black Cube that “other intelligence firmsare involved in solving this crisis—and BC is only one piece of a much largerpuzzle.”Finally, in early July, Boies and Black Cube signed a revised agreement.Weinstein agreed to pay a $190,000 settlement to square away the unpleasantnessabout the success fees. And Black Cube signed on to a new schedule of work,through November of that year, with a new, more targeted set of goals.Internally, privately, the project manager conceded that his operatives “cameshort-handed on certain issues.” In the contentious conversations withWeinstein, they’d promised to do more. They could still solve the problem. Theyjust had to get more aggressive.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Each time McHugh and I acknowledged to our bosses at NBC that we were stillkeeping an eye on the Weinstein story, a new round of warnings about our lack ofproductivity on other fronts surfaced. Soon McHugh was getting new assignmentsto work with other correspondents. Steve Chung, the NBC lawyer who had temperedGreenberg’s hesitations about viewing nondisclosure agreements with, at least, aconcession that there were shades of gray in the case law that might permit anews organization to do so, called to say he was departing the company. “You’llbe in good hands with the rest of the legal team,” he said.There were signs that we were at risk of getting scooped. As I made a last,desperate attempt to get to Ashley Judd, I called the New York Times columnistNicholas Kristof, who had worked on a documentary that featured both me andJudd. I had great respect for Kristof, who wrote about difficult human rightsissues. I thought if anyone had a chance of persuading Judd to talk, it would behim.When I told him I was working on a story about the kinds of women’s rights andhuman rights issues Judd cared about, he said immediately, “The person thisstory is about, does his name begin with an H?” When I said yes, Kristof fellsilent for a moment and then replied, speaking slowly: “I’m not at liberty tocontinue this conversation.” He got off the phone quickly.McHugh and I figured the only possible explanation was a competing New YorkTimes story. I was glad to learn we weren’t alone, but anxious to keep moving.When we told Greenberg, he seemed happy, too, but for different reasons.“Sometimes,” he said, “it’s best to let someone else go first.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]There were signs that not all of the reporting would hold indefinitely. Formonths, Rose McGowan had been all-in. In messages since our interview, she’dwritten, “I can give you more” and “This needs to be a nighttime special. Or along form morning piece. You need to come film more I think.”But that July, her patience seemed to waver. “I’ve thought about it and I’vedecided I don’t want to go forward with the NBC piece,” she told me. My stomachlurched. She wasn’t the only woman named in the story, but her interview wassignificant. I asked her to hear out what I’d uncovered before she made adecision. We agreed to meet again.I made the trek to her house in the Hollywood Hills one more time. She came tothe door wearing a tee shirt, face makeup-free. She looked tired. As we sat inher kitchen and she made coffee, McGowan told me she’d already begun toexperience the costs of speaking out. She said she’d told Price, the AmazonStudios head, that Weinstein had raped her. Not long after, her deal with thestudio was terminated.Meanwhile, she suspected she was being followed. She didn’t know whom she couldtrust. I asked if she had friends and family around. McGowan shrugged. She saidshe had some support. She and Diana Filip, the wealth manager with the women’srights project, had been drawing close. And there had been other supportivejournalists, like Freedman, the former writer for the Guardian.McGowan told me she’d grown leery of NBC, uncomfortable with the delays,concerned about—she paused here—things she’d heard about the people there. Iasked her what she meant and she shook her head and said only, “I just don’twant to be morning TV fodder.” I said that wasn’t the plan; that I did storiesfor Nightly News as well, that this was the kind of story that would goeverywhere, not just in the morning.I told McGowan there were good people at NBC, like Oppenheim, who had a careeras a screenwriter and wouldn’t feel bound by the traditional reticence ofnetwork news. But I said I needed to bring him everything, in the strongestshape it could be, and for that, I needed her. Then I told McGowan about what wehad. I said I’d encountered others with stories about Weinstein—not just rumoror innuendo—and that they’d agreed to speak, partly because they knew she’d comeforward. At this, her eyes filled with tears. “I’ve felt alone for such a longtime,” she said.McGowan said she’d been thinking a lot, writing music. She and I had bonded, thefirst time we met, over songs we’d written. In her house that day, we eachplayed a few demos. As one of hers called “Lonely House” played, she shut hereyes and listened to herself sing:I stand for mindFor women who can’tAnd men too scaredTo beat that beastTo watch him drownMcGowan regained her nerve. She told me we could air the interview. She saidshe’d go on camera again, naming Weinstein more explicitly. And she volunteered,before then, to get on the phone with NBC’s legal department and make it clearto them that she’d named him on the record.A few minutes later, I was on the phone with Oppenheim’s assistant. I told herI’d had a break in the story and would be flying back on a red-eye to see himthe next day. I’d take any opening he had on his calendar.“We have it,” McHugh said. “The clock is ticking.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]In New York the next morning, I took a winding staircase down into the basementunderneath a Bank of America. It was a rare old-fashioned vault, with a circulardoor with bolts around its periphery, and, inside, a corridor of safe-depositboxes. A bank manager pulled out a shallow metal box. It was numbered “666.”We stared at the numbers for a moment.“You know what,” he said, “I’m gonna find us something else.”In a less ominous box, I placed a list of our dozens of sources, and transcriptsof the conversations with them, and a description of the patterns of predationand settlements. I included a flash drive containing the audio from the policesting. On top, I left the note of a person who was tired and genuinely unsurewhat was paranoid and what was practical anymore but, anyway, here it is:If you’re reading this, it’s because I can’t make this information publicmyself. This is the blueprint to assembling a story that could bring a serialpredator to justice. Multiple reporters who have attempted to break this storyhave faced intimidation and threats. I have already received threatening callsfrom intermediaries. Noah Oppenheim at NBC News should be able to access theassociated video footage. Should anything happen to me, please make sure thisinformation is released."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter018]QUIDDITCH [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter018]Noah Oppenheim seemed speechless. I’d handed him a printed list of the reportingelements. “Wow,” he said. “This is a lot to digest.” It was July 12. Outside ofOppenheim’s office window, sunlight fell across Rockefeller Plaza. I explainedthat we had layers of hard evidence and credible sources. Some even knewOppenheim. Abby Ex, one of the former executives who’d gone on camera, hadrecruited him to do an uncredited punch-up on the script for the Ryan Reynoldsvehicle Self/less.“We’re going to take it to Greenberg, run it through the normal channels,” Isaid quickly. “I just wanted you to be aware.”He lifted the top page again, looked at the one underneath. “Of course I’lldefer to Rich, but—” He put the paper down on his lap, sighed. “We’re going tohave to make some decisions.”“Decisions?” I said.“Like, is this really worth it?”He was sitting on a beige couch. On a wall next to him, an array of screensflickered, news tickers racing by. Nearby, a framed diptych showed a game ofQuidditch, rendered in brown and green Magic Marker and signed by Oppenheim’seight-year-old son.“It’s a big story,” I said. “It’s a prominent guy, admitting to seriousmisconduct, on tape.”“Well, first of all,” he said, “I don’t know if that’s, you know, a crime.”“It’s a misdemeanor,” I said. “It’s months in jail, potentially.”“Okay, okay,” he said. “But we’ve gotta decide if it’s newsworthy.”I stared at him.“Look,” he said. “You know who Harvey Weinstein is. I know who Harvey Weinsteinis. But I’m in the industry. I don’t know that normal Americans do.”“Roger Ailes wasn’t a household name, either,” I pointed out. “Weinstein’s morefamous than that. And it’s a system, you know—it’s bigger than him.”“I get it,” he said. “I’m just saying we’re going to have to make the case tothe lawyers that this is worth it. There’s gonna be a lot thrown at us if we dothis.” From Wallace’s paranoiac recollections, I knew that much was true.On my way out, I thanked him and said, “And if an ‘accident’ befalls me…”He laughed, tapped the paper I’d handed him. “I’ll make sure this gets out.”“Thanks. Oh, and don’t do Self/less 2.”“I don’t know,” he deadpanned. “I might need career options after this.”That afternoon, I received another volley of strange Instagram messages, withanother image of a gun. I sent a text to Oppenheim’s assistant, Anna. “Hey,don’t want to elevate this to Noah’s level,” I wrote, “but do we have a goodsecurity person at NBC I could talk to?” I was dealing with some “stalkerissues.” Things that felt “a little more alarming than the usual.”She told me she’d look into it.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]A few hours later, I got another call from Matthew Hiltzik, the public relationsoperative. “Just catching up with people,” he said perkily. “You were on mylist.” Hiltzik had texted a few times since his last call, suggesting we get ameal, asking for updates. It was an uncharacteristic level of interest. On thephone that day, I told him I was still on book deadline and working on severalNBC stories.“So you’re still on the Harvey story?”I looked into the studio nearby. Behind glass frosted with peacock logos, amidday anchor silently mouthed headlines. “I’m working on a few stories,” Irepeated.“Alright!” he said, laughing a little. “I’m here to give you informationwhenever you need it. And I think it’s really good that you’re busy with otherthings.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]I got home that evening a little on edge. In the elevator, I started at agreeting from the boyish neighbor the superintendent always said kind of lookedlike me. Soon after, Jonathan called from a Bank of America on the West Coast,where he was finalizing the paperwork that made him a co-owner of thesafe-deposit box I’d just filled. “Don’t. Lose. The key,” I told him. As wespoke, there was a soft “ping”: another automated message about weather updates.I swiped it away.As I got into bed, a text from Lisa Bloom came in. “Hey Ronan are you stillwriting about NDAs? I have a new issue on my Kardashian case (you may have heardI rep Blac Chyna and K family is raising NDA issue). Anyway I’m coming to NYCtomorrow to do The View. Coffee/lunch Thursday or Friday?”I pushed the phone away and failed to sleep.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]McHugh and I had agreed to meet Greenberg at 8:30 a.m. I was at my cubicle,exhausted, when McHugh arrived.“You look awful,” he said.“Thanks, nice to see you, too.”A few minutes later we were in Greenberg’s cramped office. “You have a lot,” hesaid, paging through the same printed list of elements I’d handed Oppenheim theday before. Then he looked up and asked, “Can I hear the tape?”I slid my phone onto the desk in front of him and hit Play, and we listened asWeinstein said, again, that he was used to that.As Greenberg listened, a determined smile spread across his lips. “Fuck it, lethim sue,” he said, when the audio was done. “If this airs, he’s toast.”We said we were going to proceed with on-camera interviews with a few moresources from Weinstein’s company and draft both a script and a written story forthe web. Greenberg, still seeming a little excited, told us to prepare for ameeting with the legal department. McHugh and I left Greenberg’s office feelingtriumphant.Later, Anna, Oppenheim’s assistant, followed up about the stalkers. “Passingthis along to HR, they deal with this for talent,” she wrote. “Unfortunatelythese things happen more often than you think.” HR, in turn, put me in touchwith Thomas McFadden, a grizzled ex-cop. “Pretty typical stuff,” he said,scrolling through my phone in his tiny office. “Seen it a million times.”“I bet,” I said.“We’ll look into it,” he said. “Mostly, we figure out who’s hassling you, maybewe give ’em a little call, they stop what they’re doing. Once in a blue moonmaybe we call up our friends in law enforcement.”“Thanks,” I said. “I feel like there’s maybe other things happening than justthe crazies. Weird spam texts, this sense like—”“Like you’re being followed?”I laughed. “Well…,” I said.He leaned back, seemed to chew this over. Then he eyed me sympathetically.“You’re under a lot of pressure. Leave it to me and get some rest.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]All that month, McGowan and her new friend, Diana Filip of Reuben CapitalPartners, exchanged emails and calls. Whatever coast McGowan was on, Filipalways seemed to be there. A few days after my meeting with Oppenheim, they hada girls’ night out, at the Peninsula in New York. Prompted by Filip’s gentlequestioning, McGowan spoke frankly about her efforts to go public with her rapeallegation. She even revealed that she’d been talking to a reporter from NBCNews. All the while, Filip sat close, listening intently, sympathy etched on herface.The same day, Sara Ness, the investigator at Jack Palladino’s firm in SanFrancisco, sent another email to Harvey Weinstein. It contained another, moredetailed dossier. Across fifteen pages, the investigators exhaustively retracedmy steps in the preceding months, identifying many of my sources. The dossierconcluded that I’d been in touch with Sciorra, who “HW confirmed” was “apotential adverse source.”The list of reporters, too, had expanded: the dossier mentioned Kim Masters, thepugnacious writer from the Hollywood Reporter, and Nicholas Kristof, and BenWallace. It concluded that Wallace was “possibly helping to direct Farrow.”There was a final new area of focus: a writer for the New York Times named JodiKantor.The dossier identified several of Weinstein’s double agents, who had spoken tome, then reported back to him on my activities. The producer in Australia withthe strain in her voice was one of them. She had “alerted HW to Farrow’scontact,” the document said. “Did not offer any negative info about HW toFarrow.”And there were other, more veiled references to collaborators. The dossier notedthat someone identified only as “LB” had been involved in Weinstein’s effort toferret out information, quietly talking to at least one lawyer an accuserconsulted.“Investigation is continuing,” the dossier concluded.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]We kept encountering sources who threw us off the scent or reported back toWeinstein. But we were also finding more and more who were willing to stand upto him. A former assistant who had been assigned to Weinstein part-time duringhis trips to London, and told me he’d sexually harassed her, initially felttalking wasn’t worth the risk of retribution. Her fears deepened as Weinstein’sassociates began calling her “quite ferociously,” after twenty years of radiosilence. “It’s very unsettling,” she told me. “He is on your tail.” But,paradoxically, the calls had made her want to help. “I didn’t want to talk,” shesaid. “But then, hearing from him, it made me angry. Angry that he still thinkshe can silence people.”The part-time assistant also knew about Zelda Perkins, the woman who had spokenwith Auletta, and about the joint sexual harassment settlement Perkins hadsecured alongside her colleague Rowena Chiu. So did Katrina Wolfe, a formerassistant at Miramax who later became an executive. Wolfe went on camera thatmonth, with her face in shadow. “While working at Miramax I became directlyaware of two female employees of the company who had accused Harvey Weinstein ofsexual assault, and whose cases were settled,” Wolfe told me. It wasn’t hearsay:she’d directly witnessed the planning and execution of the transaction.One night in 1998, Weinstein had barreled into the office, looking for SteveHutensky, a Miramax lawyer dubbed “the Cleaner-Upper” among Weinstein’sunderlings. For forty-five minutes, the two men had huddled, Weinstein’s anxiousvoice audible to staffers nearby. Afterward, Hutensky had ordered assistants topull the personnel files of Perkins, who was then an assistant to DonnaGigliotti, the Shakespeare in Love producer, and Chiu.In the following days and weeks, Weinstein exchanged frantic calls with hisadvisors, including elite New York lawyer Herb Wachtell. (When I was a lawstudent, Wachtell’s firm was the holy grail of summer associateships. I’d beendevastated, in the way only students can be, when it rejected my application. Ihad to slum it at Davis Polk, like an ambulance chaser or President GroverCleveland.) Wachtell and Hutensky had sought an English lawyer forWeinstein—Hutensky requested “the best criminal defense attorney in England”—andthen Weinstein had gotten on a Concorde flight to London to deal with theproblem personally.I was edging closer to rendering the London settlements reportable.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The circle of on-camera interviews kept widening. A few days after the interviewwith Wolfe, I conducted another with a former assistant and producer at theWeinstein Company. He made it clear that the pattern of harassment complaintshadn’t stopped after the nineties. In more recent years, he’d been tasked withbringing young women into the honeypot meetings described by the other formeremployees. Some of the women seemed “not aware of the nature of those meetings”and “were definitely scared,” he said.He was also sometimes troubled by the aftermath of such meetings. “You’d seewomen who would come out of the room and all of a sudden there would be a giantneed to—I don’t wanna say handle the situation, but make sure they felt thatthey were rewarded or compensated professionally for what had just happened,” herecalled. “And those women seemed pretty freaked out.” Weinstein, he said, was“predatory,” and “above the law that applies to most of us and should apply toall of us.”We shot the interview at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills, with McHugh and meand a freelance shooter named Jean-Bernard Rutagarama crammed into a small roomalongside our lights and tripods and cameras.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]That month, Black Cube circulated the latest version of a list of names. Aproject manager reviewed the list at Black Cube’s satellite office inLondon—half a floor in a glass tower on Ropemaker Street, where the art on thewalls featured silhouetted operatives looming over bustling cityscapes. Then theproject manager forwarded the list to a network of contacts around the world.The list contained many of the same names—and in some cases, the samelanguage—from the dossiers generated by Jack Palladino’s firm. But the researchhad grown deeper, too. Now, secondary sources who had corroborated McGowan’s orNestor’s or Gutierrez’s stories were also targets.As the summer wore on, the list grew, with highlights appearing in yellow andthen red to indicate urgency. Some of the names on it were spun out intoseparate profiles. Soon after the interview at the Four Seasons, one suchprofile, marked “JB Rutagarama,” landed in the same in-boxes. A subheadexplained, “Relevance: Cameraman that is working with Ronan Farrow and RichMcHugh on the HW report.” The profile covered Rutagarama’s upbringing in Rwandaand explored “ways to approach him.” Its formatting was distinctive, withheaders in blue italic Times New Roman and English-as-a-second-languagemalapropisms.Among the contacts to whom the Black Cube project manager sent the list, and theprofile of Rutagarama, was Seth Freedman, the former writer for the Guardian."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter019]SPIRAL [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter019]That July, I called back Auletta and told him I had more information about thesettlements in London. I asked if there was anything else he could show me tohelp shore up my reporting. To my surprise, he said, “Actually, yes.” He’d givenall his reporters’ notebooks, printed documents, and tapes to the New YorkPublic Library. The collection remained closed to the public. But he said Icould take a look.The Auletta files were housed in the Reading Room for Rare Books andManuscripts, beyond the great hall. It was a dim chamber with sealed glassshelves and rows of low desks that glowed under reading lights. The librarypossessed more than sixty large cardboard boxes of Auletta’s papers all told.McHugh and I signed in and a librarian brought out the boxes.McHugh and I each took a box and began poring over their contents. Aulettadidn’t have nearly as much as we did. But he had grasped at essential pieces ofthe puzzle. It was strange, seeing notes from fifteen years earlier that coveredsuch similar ground. Even then, Auletta was encountering abandoned reportingjobs. On one page of notes, he had scrawled in doctor-illegible blue cursive:“David Carr: believes sexual harassment.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]In Auletta’s spiral-bound reporter’s notebooks, I found clues that led me toother clues, and which synced up with my emerging picture of what had happenedbetween Weinstein and the two assistants in London.In the late nineties, Perkins had started working as an assistant to Gigliotti.In practice, this meant working for Weinstein much of the time. “From my veryfirst time left alone with Harvey,” she told me later, “I had to deal with himbeing present either in his underpants or totally naked.” He’d try to pull herinto bed. Perkins was petite and blond and looked younger than her years. Butshe also had a sharp personality and was, even then, defiantly assertive.Weinstein never succeeded in his physical advances. The unending fusillade ofattempts, though, exhausted her. And soon, he was wearing her down in otherways. Like so many of Weinstein’s former employees, she found herself cast as afacilitator of sexual liaisons with aspiring actresses and models. “We had tobring girls to him,” she said. “Though I wasn’t aware of it at first, I was ahoneypot.” Weinstein would ask her to buy condoms for him and clean up afterhotel-room meetings with the young women.It was 1998 when Perkins got the green light to hire an assistant of her own,something she hoped would put some distance between her and Weinstein. Shewarned candidates for the job that Weinstein would make sexual advances. Sheeven rejected “very overtly attractive” applicants, “because I knew he’d neverleave them alone. It would never stop.” In the end, she chose Chiu, a“prodigiously bright” Oxford graduate, who would overcome paralyzing fears ofretaliation and make her name public only years later.At the Hotel Excelsior during the Venice Film Festival in September 1998, Chiuemerged from a meeting with Weinstein in his hotel room, shaking and crying,saying he had pushed her against a bed and attempted to assault her. Perkinsconfronted Weinstein, interrupting a lunch meeting with a prominent director onthe hotel terrace. “He stood there and he lied and lied and lied,” Perkinsrecalled. “I said, ‘Harvey, you are lying,’ and he said, ‘I’m not lying; I swearon the lives of my children.’”Chiu was, Perkins said, “shocked and in a traumatized state,” and too frightenedto go to the police. The difficulty of reporting the allegation was deepened bytheir location at the time, Venice’s Lido island. “I didn’t know who I would goto,” Perkins recalled. “The security guard in the hotel?”Perkins did what she could to ensure that Chiu was kept away from Weinstein forthe remainder of the trip. After returning to England, Perkins notifiedGigliotti, who gave her a referral to an employment attorney. Eventually,Perkins and Chiu sent notice that they were resigning from Miramax and pursuinglegal action.Their departure from the company set in motion the frenetic meetings at Miramaxthat Wolfe had described to me. Weinstein and other executives called Perkinsand Chiu again and again. The night she resigned, Perkins received seventeencalls of “increasing desperation” from them. In the messages, Weinstein veeredbetween pleading and menacing. “Please, please, please, please, please, pleasecall me. I’m begging you,” he said in one message.Perkins and Chiu hired lawyers from the London-based firm Simons Muirhead &Burton. Perkins initially pushed back on accepting what she called “blood money”and inquired about going to the police, or to Disney, Miramax’s parent company.But the attorneys seemed intent on foreclosing any outcome except a settlementand a nondisclosure agreement. In the end, she and Chiu accepted a settlement oftwo hundred fifty thousand pounds, to be evenly split between them. Weinstein’sbrother, Bob, cut the check to the women’s law firm, obscuring the transactionfrom Disney and distancing it from Harvey.In an exhausting four-day negotiation process, Perkins prevailed in addingprovisions to the contract that she hoped would change Weinstein’s behavior. Theagreement mandated the appointment of three “handlers,” one an attorney, torespond to sexual harassment allegations at Miramax. The company was obligatedto provide proof that Weinstein was receiving counseling for three years or “aslong as his therapist deems necessary.” The agreement also required Miramax toreport Weinstein’s behavior to Disney and fire him if a subsequent sexualharassment settlement was reached in the following two years.The company implemented the human resources changes, but other parts of theagreement were not enforced. Perkins pressed for months, then gave up. “I wasexhausted. I was humiliated. I couldn’t work in the industry in the UK becausethe stories that were going around about what had happened made it impossible,”she recalled. In the end, she moved to Central America. She’d had enough. “Moneyand power enabled, and the legal system has enabled,” she eventually told me.“Ultimately, the reason Harvey Weinstein followed the route he did is because hewas allowed to, and that’s our fault. As a culture that’s our fault.”Auletta hadn’t captured all of the details of the story, but he’d gotten thebones of it right. I looked at his meticulously organized notes and felt, for amoment, emotional about the dusty boxes and the old secrets they held. I wantedbadly to believe that news didn’t die, even when it was beaten back for so manyyears.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]As I finished both our script for television and a 6,000-word written story forthe NBC News website, the ghosts of reporting attempts past seemed to gather. Inlate July, I finally called Janice Min, the former Hollywood Reporter editor.She was fierce in her belief that the story was real, and doubtful as to whetherit would ever break. Min had come to the Hollywood Reporter from Us Weekly, buther roots were as a crime journalist for the Reporter Dispatch in New York. “Weall knew it was true,” she told me. “But we never got it over the finish line.Everyone was always too afraid to talk.” She said she’d connect me with KimMasters, the writer who’d worked on the story during Min’s time at the magazine.“It’s an impossible story,” Min said, before we got off the phone that day.“It’s the white whale of journalism.”“White Whale,” McHugh texted later that day. “Great frickin’ title.”Masters was invariably described as a veteran media journalist, which she jokedwas a euphemistic way to call her old. She’d worked as a staff writer for theWashington Post and a contributor for Vanity Fair, Time, and Esquire. She toldme she’d heard the rumors about Weinstein “forever.” Once, years earlier, she’deven confronted him about them.“Why are you writing this shit about me?” he’d roared at her at a lunch at thePeninsula in Beverly Hills. “Why do you say that I’m a bully?”“Well, Harvey,” Masters recalled telling him. “I hear you rape women.”“Sometimes you have sex with a woman who’s not your wife, and there’s adisagreement about what’s happened, and you just have to write a check to makeit go away,” Weinstein replied calmly. Hiltzik, the public relations operative,was also there that day. Masters recalled him looking shocked. He’d later denythat he heard her mention rape.Masters wasn’t convinced so much had changed, all those years later. A fewmonths earlier, she’d worked on a story about an accusation of sexual harassmentagainst Roy Price, the Amazon Studios executive who had canned McGowan’s deal,and a figure around whom such claims had long circulated. But the HollywoodReporter, where Masters had written articles for seven years, had passed on thestory. That summer, she was still trying to rescue it, shopping it to BuzzFeedand then to the Daily Beast. Price had hired Charles Harder, the same Gawker-slaying attorney Weinstein was using, to approach the outlets. “One of thesedays,” Masters told me wearily, “the dam is gonna have to break.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]I came back to Ken Auletta and asked him if he’d give an interview. For us,putting a print reporter who’d worked on a story on camera was routine. For him,it felt like an extraordinary step, relitigating old reporting. But when I toldhim what we had, including the audio of Weinstein’s confession, he said he’dmake an exception. We arrived at Auletta’s home on Long Island in the midst of atorrential downpour and hauled in our equipment through the rain. He confirmedthat he’d seen evidence of the London settlements and concluded, as we had, thatWeinstein had routinely purchased women’s silence. And Auletta spoke of hisquixotic returns to the topic over the decades. Running the story was important,he said, “to maybe stop him from doing it again.”Auletta, unprompted, looked at the camera.“Tell Andy Lack, who’s a friend of mine, he should publish this story. He will.”“Okay,” I said.“If NBC, which has the evidence, doesn’t go forward with this story, it’s ascandal.” Our shooter exchanged a nervous glance with McHugh. I told Aulettathat I was sure NBC would run it. “Well, you better hurry,” he replied. “If theTimes is on it—”“I know,” I said. And we both looked out of his living room at the storm.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The same day, Diana Filip followed up with Rose McGowan. “I’m back home, andjust wanted to thank you again for the wonderful evening!” she wrote. “It’salways a pleasure seeing you and spending time with you :). I sincerely hopeI’ll be back soon and that this time we’ll have more time!”And then she came to the point: “I was thinking about Ronan Farrow, who youmentioned during our meeting. I still cannot get his photo out of my head. Seemslike a really impressive and sweet guy. I read a bit about him and was veryimpressed by his work, despite the problematic family connection… I was thinkingthat someone like him could be an interesting and valuable addition to ourproject (not for the conference, but the annual activity through 2018), due tothe fact that he’s a pro-female male,” Filip continued. “Do you think you couldintroduce us, in order to look into this opportunity further?”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter020]CULT [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter020]The script we developed, over the course of late July, was spare and economical.It included the tape, naming Gutierrez with her cooperation, as well asMcGowan’s on-camera, on-the-record interview, and Nestor’s interview with herface in shadow, accompanied by images of her messages from Irwin Reiter,documenting how Weinstein’s behavior was seen as a serial problem within thecompany. The evidence we’d uncovered of the two settlements in London wasincluded, based on multiple firsthand accounts of the negotiations and the checkfrom Bob Weinstein’s account. And there were sound bites from the four formeremployees who had gone on camera.McHugh, in the same period, had stumbled into a subplot. At a hockey game—heplayed a lot, and periodically limped into the office with arcane injuriessustained on the ice—he’d run into a friend in the film industry who had tippedhim off that there was mounting scrutiny of Weinstein’s role on the board ofamfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research. Fellow board members suspectedWeinstein had misused funds destined for the charity. Weinstein was trying toget them to sign nondisclosure agreements.“Feels like 2nd beat,” McHugh texted, “but maybe worth being aggressive?”“I’d pursue quietly,” I replied. “Don’t want to trigger anything that couldadversely impact this first story.”After McHugh sent me his notes on the script, he wrote, “Time to get the realconvo going between you, legal, Rich, and me, and see the real tenor of thisnews org.”“Yup,” I replied.“We make an oddly good combo,” he added. “Not b/c we work well, but because it’sfrustrating i’m sure to someone who is trying to find dirt or disparage usindividually.” Neither of us knew that McHugh’s name—the names, even, of ourcrew members—were by then all over dossiers quietly making their way around theworld.We both had the sense, as we finished the story, that attacks were coming. Wejust didn’t know what form they’d take. “He has a lot to lose, back up againstcorner,” McHugh pointed out. “It’ll be war.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The last week of July, Susan Weiner, the general counsel of NBC News, sat withRich Greenberg, McHugh, and me in Greenberg’s office and paged through thescript and elements list. I’d worked with Weiner before on investigations deemedparticularly troublesome or likely to generate litigation. I’d found her to be agood lawyer, with sound instincts. And she’d been supportive of the reporting,even when I’d picked subjects like a litigious Korean doomsday cult. Before hertwenty-plus years at NBC, Weiner had been deputy general counsel at the New YorkMetropolitan Transportation Authority. She was thin and pale, with a shock offrizzy hair. In the office that day, she peered over her glasses and pursed herlips. “You’ve got a lot,” Weiner said.“Can you play her the tape?” said Greenberg, with undisguised excitement. He’dalready read, and liked, the script. In a meeting with him earlier that day,McHugh had prevailed in arguing for a longer-than-standard script, with an eyetoward airing it on the web. Shorter Today show and Nightly News versions couldeasily be slivered off.As the audio wound down, Weiner’s tight expression dissolved into a half smile.“Wow,” she said.“And the source will meet you, or whomever you want from legal, to show you thecontract with Weinstein’s signature on it,” I said.I asked her if she saw any outstanding legal issues based on her review of thematerial so far, and she said she didn’t. “I think our next step is to seekcomment,” she said. McHugh shot me a relieved look. The news division’s toplawyer and Greenberg, a veteran of its standards department, both wanted toproceed. Greenberg nodded at Weiner. “I want to let Noah know before we do,” hesaid.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Greenberg was still excited, barely suppressing a smile, as he, Weiner, McHugh,and I sat down with Oppenheim in his office later that day. Oppenheim flippedthrough his copy of the script, written story, and elements list. A groovedeepened in his brow.“It’s just a draft script,” I said. “We’ll get it tighter.”“Okay,” he said flatly.“We thought you should hear the audio,” Greenberg said. He seemed to be caughtoff guard by Oppenheim’s lack of enthusiasm. “It’s pretty powerful.”Oppenheim nodded. He was still looking at the pages, not making eye contact.Greenberg nodded at me. I hit Play and held my phone out.“No,” Ambra Gutierrez said, her voice shot through with fear. “I’m notcomfortable.”“I’m used to that,” Harvey Weinstein said again.Oppenheim slouched deeper into the chair, like he was shrinking into himself.There was a yawning silence after the tape finished playing. Apparentlyrealizing that we were waiting for him to say something, Oppenheim produced asound somewhere between a weary sigh and an apathetic “eh” and made a shrugginggesture. “I mean…,” he said, drawing out the word. “I don’t know what thatproves.”“He admits to groping her,” I said.“He’s trying to get rid of her. People say a lot of things when they’re tryingto get rid of a girl like that.”I stared at him. Greenberg and Weiner stared at him.“Look,” he said, annoyance creeping into his voice. “I’m not saying it’s notgross, but I’m still not sure it’s news.”“We have a prominent person admitting to serious misconduct on tape,” I said.“We have multiple-sourced accounts of five instances of misconduct, with twowomen willing to put their name out there, we have multiple former employeessaying this was a pattern, we have his signature on a million-dollar settlementcontract—”He waved a hand at me. “I don’t know if we can show contracts,” he said. McHughand I glanced at each other. We couldn’t figure out why a news organization,which reported contractually protected information routinely in nationalsecurity and business contexts, would suddenly be so concerned about upholdingsettlements related to sexual harassment.“We’re not relying solely on the contracts, obviously,” I said. “But patterns ofsettlements are newsworthy. Look at the Fox story—”“This isn’t Fox,” he said. “I still don’t think Harvey Weinstein’s a name theToday show audience knows.” He looked at the pages again. “And anyway, wherewould we even air it? This looks long.”“We’ve run seven-minute pieces on Today before. I can cut it down to that.”“Maybe Megyn’s show, but that’s going away now,” he said, seeming to ignorethis. Megyn Kelly was concluding a brief stint anchoring a Sunday nightnewsmagazine program.“We can put it on the web,” McHugh suggested.I nodded. “And the written version can go online, too.”Oppenheim turned to Greenberg. “What are you proposing?”“We’d like to reach out to Harvey Weinstein for comment,” Greenberg said.Oppenheim looked at Weiner. She nodded. “I think there’s enough here to proceedwith that call,” she said.Oppenheim looked at the pages in front of him.“No, no, no,” he said. A nervous titter of laughter escaped him. “We can’t callHarvey. I’ve got to take this to Andy.”He rose, pages in hand. The meeting was over.“Thank you. I think it’ll make a big impact, whatever platform we put it on,” Ibabbled, as Oppenheim ushered me out.McHugh shot me a stunned look. Neither of us could make sense of the reaction.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The earlier months of the year had been dominated by the kind of targetsOstrovskiy, the Ukrainian private investigator, was used to: four hours chasinga cheating spouse here, six tailing the wayward teenage son of a nervous motherthere. In return, Khaykin, the bald Russian, would send over the agreed-uponthirty-five bucks an hour, plus expenses. But as the summer unfolded, Khaykinwas issuing assignments that felt different. These jobs gave Ostrovskiy pause.They drove him back to that troublesome tendency to ask questions.Before dawn on July 27, Ostrovskiy headed to the next of those jobs. When hearrived at what looked to be a residential address, he found Khaykin’s car, asilver Nissan Pathfinder. He and Khaykin agreed that they’d split up, Ostrovskiykeeping an eye on the target’s home, Khaykin standing ready to give chase to awork address.Khaykin hadn’t said much about these new assignments. He’d just sent over aseries of screenshots, from some kind of dossier from a client. The screenshotsfeatured addresses, phone numbers, birth dates, biographical information. Theyidentified spouses and other family members. Ostrovskiy’s first thought was thatthey were following some kind of custody dispute, but that explanation fit lessand less as the summer wore on.Ostrovskiy flicked through the screenshots as he hunkered down to keep watch onthe address. The formatting was identical to that of the documents that had madetheir way through the offices on Ropemaker Street in London, with blue italicTimes New Roman headers and shaky English. As he looked at the details, astrange feeling came over him. He wasn’t used to following reporters."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter021]SCANDAL [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter021]On a muggy morning not long after the meeting with Oppenheim, I made my waythrough the sweating crowds, past the tilted cube at Astor Place, toward theEast Village. I’d texted McGowan and she’d agreed to meet. At the Airbnb whereshe was staying, she emerged in pajamas, a half-moon silicone pad under eacheye. She gestured to the absurd room around her, which was princess-pink, withfuzzy pillows everywhere. “I didn’t decorate,” she deadpanned. She was drawn,nervous, even more stressed than when we’d last met. I told her we had strongermaterial than ever, but that her voice was going to be important. I wanted totake her up on her suggestion that we shoot more, and her offer to nameWeinstein to the NBC lawyers.“I don’t trust NBC,” she said.“They’ve been”—I paused—“careful. But I know they’re good people and they’ll doright by the story.”She took a breath, seeming to steel herself. “Okay,” she said. “I’ll do it.”She agreed to shoot a follow-up interview a few days later. She had to goreplace Val Kilmer at Tampa Bay Comic Con first. “That’ll be fun,” I said, as Istepped back out into the heat. “No, it won’t,” she replied.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]I was back at work, in the cafeteria, when my phone rang. It was Greenberg.“Great news,” I said. “I spoke with Rose and—”“Can you talk?” he said.In his small office, Greenberg let me babble through my update on McGowan.“So I know you’ve been asking for an update,” he said. In the two days since themeeting with Oppenheim, I had stopped by Greenberg’s office three times to askif he had any word from Lack.Greenberg took a breath, as if bracing for something. “The story is now underreview by NBCUniversal.” He wrapped his mouth around these last words strangely,like he was quoting a lyric in a foreign language. Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto.“NBCUniversal,” I said. “Not NBC News.”“It’s gone upstairs. I don’t know whether that involves Steve Burke or BrianRoberts,” he said, referring to the top executives at NBCUniversal and itsparent company, Comcast, “but it’s under legal review.” Greenberg was fidgeting,jiggling a knee under the desk. “Maybe once, when we got close to air on a toughstory, I saw a high-level corporate review. But this is very atypical.”“What are they basing this review on?” No one had asked us for additional copiesof material, or for the audio.“I don’t know,” he said absently.An NBCUniversal legal review meant Kim Harris, the general counsel ofNBCUniversal—who had, with Weiner, presided over the “pussy grab” tape imbrogliothe year before. Harris had also, years earlier, recruited me as a summerassociate at Davis Polk.“I’d be happy to send the material to Kim,” I suggested. “I can play her thetape.”“My gosh, no!” Greenberg said, mortified, like I’d proposed an orgy with hisgrandparents or something. “No, no, no! Let’s—we’ll respect the process andremain at arm’s length. I’ll make sure Susan sends them whatever they need.”I wondered what logic we could have for keeping our own lawyers at “arm’slength,” but said, instead, “Well, I’d like to know as much as I can, when Ican. And I’ll keep you updated on the follow-up interview with Rose.”He flinched. “We’re supposed to pause all reporting.”“Rich. It’s been hell keeping Rose hanging in there at all. Now we have morefrom her and you want me to go back to her and cancel?”“Not cancel,” he said, “pause.”“There is an actual interview date set. I would be canceling.”I asked him how long we were supposed to “pause.”“I—I would anticipate that it won’t move fast,” he said. “I mean, I have no ideawhat their process is. But this could take more than a few days.”“Rich. I don’t think anyone in our chain of command wants to be in the position,as a matter of record, of having canceled hard-fought pieces of reporting duringa corporate review by our parent company.”“Things get canceled for all sorts of reasons. Nobody outside the company has toknow why.”“If you tell them what you told me and Rich, it will matter for what happens tothis story,” I said, referring to his “fuck it, let him sue” and his decision togo to Weinstein for comment. It was hard to square that guy with this guy.“This is a Steve Burke decision. It’s an Andy decision,” he replied. His eyesflicked away from mine. “What I say is not gonna matter.” I believed RichGreenberg when he said he cared about journalism. I believed, absent friction,that he would have supported the reporting and pursued the interview withMcGowan. But several colleagues of his said he shied from messy confrontations.“He’s really good as long as he’s not in front of the pack,” one veterancorrespondent later told me. “He doesn’t have the stomach forsomebody’s-gonna-be-mad-at-you investigative reporting.” Few stories got peoplemadder than this one. That day in Greenberg’s office, I remember thinking howsmall he seemed—not defeated so much as comfortable within the narrow bounds ofwhat he could and could not do inside an organization to which he had devotedseventeen years of his life.Exasperated, I told him, “Look, Ken Auletta just turned to the camera and said,Andy Lack, this is a scandal if you don’t run this.”Greenberg’s eyes snapped up. “Do we have that? Is that in the script?”I looked at him, puzzled. “It’s in the transcript.”“Send that to me,” he said.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]As I pushed out of the back doors of 30 Rock and into the summer heat, McHughand I texted, debating what to do. There seemed to be no interest, in theloftiest echelons of the corporation, in hearing the tape or learning the fullextent of the reporting. The only person who might have access to the corporatereview that Greenberg hadn’t discouraged us from reaching out to was Weiner,who, as the top lawyer in the news division, reported to Harris. I’d beguncalling her the moment I emerged from the meeting with Greenberg. An assistant Ireached told me not to stop by. After hours of calls, Weiner emailed to say shewas busy, then leaving for a long weekend.Then there was the dilemma about what to do about the interview with McGowan.“We are shooting with Rose. We are not canceling,” McHugh texted. We both knewpostponing could mean losing the interview entirely. On the other hand, refusingGreenberg’s order to cancel the shoot might mean jeopardizing the increasinglytenuous support for the story within the network.With the legal department not taking our calls, I grappled with whom to turn to.Arriving back at my apartment, I decided to take a risk and call Tom Brokaw.“Tom, I’m going to need to rely on that promise you made,” I said. “About nottalking to the subject of that story we discussed.”“You have my word,” said Brokaw.I told him about the corporate intercession. I ran him through the list ofinterviews and evidence.“This is wrong,” he said. He told me he’d reach out to the network’s leadershipabout it. “You need to talk to Andy. You need to go in and play that tape forhim.”I sent Greenberg the Auletta transcript, as he requested, with the comment abouthow it would be a scandal not to air the story highlighted. Then I forwarded itto Oppenheim.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]A few hours later, the phone rang.“I got your email,” said Oppenheim. “Sooo”—he drew out this word, like anemphatic teenager—“I hope, based on our two-and-a-half-year, or whatever,relationship, that you know you can trust me to do this process right. And thisisn’t about ‘Andy doesn’t want to do this,’ or ‘I don’t want to do this.’ If wecan establish that he’s a—a ‘predator,’ to use your term—”“To be clear, that’s not coming from me. We have documents and sources fromwithin his company making that claim.”“Alright, alright,” he said. “I hear you. If we could establish that he’s,whatever, of course we’d want to get it out. We just need to, um, stress-testthis, and Kim, who I know you’ve known since you were, like, sixteen, is goingto do that and tell us what we can really be bulletproof in saying, what canhold up in court.”I told him that was all well and good as long as reporting wasn’t beinginterrupted. I mentioned the interview we’d scheduled with McGowan.“You just can’t, Ronan,” he replied. “If Kim decides that tortious interferenceor inducement to breach contract are big concerns for us, we can’t be rushingahead with an interview before she makes that call.”“That’s not how this works,” I told him. “We can get it in the can and thendecide to review it later. Airing it is what makes it subject to litigation.”“I don’t know,” he said, defensively. “I’m not a lawyer. If they’re sayingtortious interference, I’ve gotta listen.”“I am a lawyer, Noah. That’s just not a real rationale. Half our politicalreporting wouldn’t be possible if we refused to talk to sources who werebreaching contracts.” It was true: there were few solid cases that supported theidea that news organizations, acting in good faith, could be exposed tosignificant liability in cases like this.“Well, forgive me if I take Kim Harris’s legal advice over yours,” he saidtartly.I tried to think how to underline the stakes while conveying that I was a teamplayer. “My sense is this is gonna come out,” I said, “and the question iswhether it comes out with or without us sitting on the evidence we have.”A long silence. “You’d better be careful,” he said at last. “’Cause I knowyou’re not threatening, but people could think you’re threatening to go public.”I knew what he meant, but the choice of words struck me as odd. Weren’t we inthe business of going public?“But that’s just it,” I said. “I think threatening us is exactly what KenAuletta was doing. And I think that’s why Rich asked me to send him that quote.And why I forwarded it to you. A lot of people know we have this.”“Well,” he said, “we’re not ‘sitting on it,’ we’re reviewing it carefully.”He softened a little, tried something different. “Ronan, you know in my years ofsupporting you, we’ve run a series of stories that could get us sued, and we’vestood by them.”“I trust you’ll do the right thing,” I said. “There have just been some oddsignals.”“We’re just hitting pause while we wrap our arms around this,” he said. “That’sall I’m asking.” On some level, I knew these euphemisms—the “pauses,” thewrapping of arms—to be absurd. Canceling an interview was canceling aninterview. The word doubleplusungood wandered through my mind. But I neededOppenheim’s support to get the story over the finish line.I looked out of the window. Across the street, the lights were off and the dancestudio was in shadow. “I’m glad you called,” I said. “I do trust you.”“Just hang tight,” he said. “No more reporting for a little bit.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 22: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter022]PATHFINDER [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter022]“We were right to keep our mouths shut,” McHugh texted. We decided we’d pushedOppenheim as far as we could. “I’d just sit back, work the phones and whatnot,but let the NBC team be. You’ve said your piece.” But this still left the trickyproposition of the shoot with McGowan and the order to cancel it.“Did Noah say don’t do it?” McHugh wrote.“Yes.”“Quandary.”“It’s tempting to just push it back and risk losing her,” I replied. “Just toavoid the fight with Noah. Think I can freely consult Greenberg on this?”“Not sure any more,” he wrote.We were starting to concede that we might have to take the risk of reschedulingwith McGowan. “I’m not sure another rose intv is critical to our story. But nbchaving our back, in some ways, will be,” McHugh wrote. “I am thinking, maybethere’s a way to push it to LA and buy ourselves a little more time?”I took a deep breath and dialed McGowan. “We were looking at maybe doing a laterdate,” I said, feeling her out. “We could shoot more with you in Los Angeles, goback to your place.”Her voice was small on the other end of the line. “I’m not sure I can do this,”she said. “There’s a lot coming at me.”“Just—just hang in there,” I said. “Please. For the other sources involved. Ipromise you it’s just a little longer.”“I knew NBC wasn’t going to take this seriously.”“They’re taking it seriously. I’m taking it seriously.”“I offered to call the lawyers.”“They—we’re going to do that, they’re just reviewing things,” I said. She didn’tsay anything. “If Tuesday’s all you can do, we’ll do Tuesday,” I said quickly.“Don’t worry about it.”She said we could look at options. But I could hear the uncertainty creepinginto her voice.A few minutes later, Jonathan, on the phone from Los Angeles, was working up alather. He thought I should flout Greenberg’s orders and call Kim Harris. He wasincredulous at the legal arguments Oppenheim had raised. For any layperson witha dim recollection of the term, “tortious interference” was probably best knownas the specious rationale used by CBS News’s parent company to shut down thatnetwork’s tobacco reporting. That day McHugh and Jonathan both made the samecomparison: “Hasn’t anyone in this company seen The Insider?” Jonathan asked,exasperated.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The next morning, I called Kim Harris’s office several times before sheresponded by email. Harris wrote that she’d been traveling for several days. Wecould meet the following week, perhaps. But this would be too late for theMcGowan interview. I pleaded. “Canceling it could mean we don’t get it back,” Ireplied. I offered to pre-brief with Harris and let her dictate my posture inthe interview, as I’d done with Chung before the early interviews. Then I calledWeiner and left her a voicemail making the same points again. “Susan, as amatter of record, I don’t want us to have to be canceling reporting. I knowyou’re both out, but please respond.”As I hung up, Greenberg motioned me into his office. “So,” he said, “I calledHarvey back.”“What did you say?” I asked.“I told him legal is vetting it and nothing’s running for now.” He saidWeinstein had told him he wanted to send a letter to NBC’s legal department, andGreenberg had directed him to Susan Weiner. “He may accuse you of maligning himin conversations,” he added.I laughed. Greenberg stayed serious. “Obviously, I’ve been incredibly carefulnot to malign him beyond asking neutral questions,” I said. “I’ll stand byanything I’ve said or put in writing.”“Just be careful,” Greenberg said.I asked him if he had any word on the McGowan interview, and he said legal wasstill deciding if it could go ahead. I thought of McGowan’s fraying resolve, herreeling at my attempt to cancel.Not long after, word came back. My begging had worked. Legal would allow theinterview to proceed the following week. But the wavering had exacted its toll.As they decided, McGowan texted: “I can’t film. Or be in your segment. I’m sosorry. The legal angle is coming at me and I have no recourse.”Over the following hours, my attempts to bring her back into the fold wentnowhere. “I’m hamstrung,” she said finally. “I can’t talk.” McGowan seemedincreasingly distraught. In the following weeks, her lawyers would follow upwith aggressive cease and desist letters.I walked into Greenberg’s office and told him immediately. “I’m going to try toget her back on board,” I said. He thought for a moment, then shrugged.“Honestly, it makes me less nervous if she’s not in the script,” he said. “Shealways sounded a little—well, you know.”“Emily Nestor was close to going on camera full face. I can go back to her.”“Just wait,” he said.“It’d be calling an existing source.”“Let’s just do this by the book from here. No new reporting for now,” he said,as Oppenheim had.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]I got home from work and my phone chimed: another text asking me to opt intoweather alerts. I swiped it away. Another ping: this time, it was an old schoolfriend calling. I pressed my eyes shut. “I can’t go out, Erin,” I said. ErinFitzgerald had the kind of high-end consulting job that repeated explanationsshed little light on.“No one’s seen you in, like, six months,” she said, over a hum of cocktailconversation. “What’s going on with you?”“You know. On a big story.”“Whatever that means.”“Yeah,” I said.“Well, you’re coming tonight.” And she wouldn’t take no for an answer. I satwith her and another friend on a crowded rooftop in Brooklyn and looked at thecity, and realized I’d barely left my apartment that summer. “I’m on thisassignment where I feel like I’m burning all my bridges one by one,” I said. Sheshrugged. “Here, come!” she said, pulling me over to the parapet. We stood infront of the glittering Manhattan skyline and posed for a picture.The next day, Ostrovskiy began his routine inspection of my social mediaaccounts and those of my friends and relatives. Coming to an Instagram postshowing me and a pretty girl against the Manhattan skyline, he lingered andfelt, for a moment, relieved. I was in town after all.By then, he and Khaykin had begun their latest assignment, but without muchsuccess. They’d billed a few hours following the woman from the New York Times,taking some photographs of her on the subway and then giving up after shedisappeared into the Times building. The client’s attention soon turned to thetelevision reporter with the story that seemed to be in a state of flux.But this was proving to be a challenge, too. Seeing that I was on the Today showone morning, Ostrovskiy and Khaykin disagreed about how best to capitalize onthe opportunity.“Hey, he’s on the show,” Ostrovskiy had said.“Is it worth going? To see if we get him coming out?” Khaykin replied.Ostrovskiy thought about this. Something about it made him uncomfortable. “It’sa really busy area, Rockefeller Center,” he pointed out. “We can’t get there ina car. We don’t have enough people to cover all the entrances and exits.”Not long after, as hot July gave way to a still hotter early August, I left homein the morning and walked right by the silver Nissan Pathfinder parked on thestreet immediately opposite my address. Only later did I register the memory ofthe two men sitting inside: one thin and bald, the other heavyset, with dark,curly hair.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]All that spring and summer, headlines about harassment and abuse had picked uppace : a fresh round of stories about Fox News; more scrutiny about PresidentTrump. I was starting to field inquiries from women’s rights activistssupportive of my reporting on gender discrimination. As Ostrovskiy and Khaykindebated 30 Rockefeller Plaza’s suitability for interception, one of thosemessages landed in my in-box, describing a women’s advocacy program run by awealth management company. It included a request to meet the following week. Iglanced at the email and moved on without responding. “I am very impressed withyour work as a male advocate for gender equality, and believe that you wouldmake an invaluable addition to our activities,” wrote Diana Filip of ReubenCapital Partners."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter023]CANDY [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter023]The first week of August, I arrived at Harris’s office, in a light-filledcorporate suite high in the building. Declining a call from my mother as Iarrived, I texted her, “Going into meeting with parent company lawyer. Say aprayer.” I’d broken rank to contact Harris and she hadn’t added anyone to ouremails. But Greenberg arrived a few minutes later, followed by Weiner.The difference between the two women in the room was elemental, almost atomic.While Weiner was quiet and bureaucratic, Harris possessed outsize charisma. Shehad graduated from the best Ivy League institutions, in the sequence required toachieve maximum prestige. She’d worked in the Obama White House and as a partnerat a top-ranked firm. She was faster on her feet than the company veterans inthe room, and less intent on ceremony. She had big, genial features and a quicksmile. Harris was the deadliest kind of lawyer, one sophisticated enough thatyou didn’t see her doing the work at all.She pulled out a copy of the script and ran through a few small language notes.And then: “I also think we’re open to a tortious interference argument.” I keptmy face composed. I wasn’t about to parse case law with the company’s generalcounsel, but I knew this was bullshit.Still, talking to Harris was generally reassuring. Her order, from a legalstandpoint—separate from the news division’s editorial decision—was not to standdown. She wanted another script, with the edits we’d discussed.A few hours later, on my way out of the building, I ran into Weiner. Outside,rain was pounding at the lobby’s revolving doors. To my surprise, she fixed mewith a meaningful stare, and said, “Keep going.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]As the Weinstein story had expanded to fill more and more of McHugh’s and mydays and nights, I’d struggled to keep my canceled foreign policy book alive andfind it a new publisher. All of the living secretaries of state had agreed to goon the record for the project, and I’d kept racing from our shoots intointerviews with them. Hillary Clinton, who’d known about the book since Idescribed it to her during my time working for her at the State Department, hadagreed early and with enthusiasm. “Thank you, my friend, for your message; it isgreat hearing from you and I am delighted to know that you are close tocompleting your book project,” she wrote that July. The letter was printed onembossed stationery in a curly art deco font, like a New Yorker headline or apiece of set-dressing from BioShock. It was very lovely, and not the sort ofthing that wins Wisconsin. Several rounds of calls and emails had ensued, and aninterview date had been promised that month, ahead of the beginning of apromotional tour for Clinton’s latest memoir.The afternoon of the meeting with Harris, as I pushed through the downpour andinto my building’s front door, a call came in from Nick Merrill, Clinton’sflack. We discussed the book briefly, and then he said, “By the way, we knowabout the big story you’re on.”I sat down on one of the chairs in my building’s lobby. “Well, Nick, I’mprobably working on a lot of stories at any given time.”“You know what I mean,” he said.“I really can’t say anything.”“Well, you know, it’s a concern for us.”I felt a rivulet of rain run down my neck. “Can I ask who said this to you?” Isaid.“Maybe off the record, over drinks,” he replied. “Let’s just say people aretalking.”When I turned the conversation back to the interview with Clinton, he said thatshe was “really busy with the book tour.” I pointed out that this was why we’dscheduled the interview for before the book tour. “Like I said,” he reiterated,as if he hadn’t heard this, “really busy.” Over the ensuing weeks, every attemptto lock a date for the interview yielded another terse note that she’d becomesuddenly unavailable. She’d injured her foot. She was too tired. Clinton,meanwhile, was becoming one of the most easily available interviews in all ofpolitics.Later, Merrill would swear up and down that Clinton’s sudden reticence wascoincidental. Whatever the motivation, it felt ominous—another screw turning,another sign of my life outside the story shrinking. It was hard not to sense apattern forming: each time we came back to our bosses with more reporting, wordof the story seemed to spread farther. McHugh and I both worried aboutprotecting our sources.“If someone’s leaking to Clinton, what’s getting leaked to Harvey?” McHughwondered.“Shit,” I said. “You don’t think they would—”“I don’t know,” he said. “That’s the problem.”As pressure on the story mounted, fissures between McHugh and me widened. Ourexchanges grew terse. After the meeting with Harris, he was miffed he hadn’tbeen included, and seemed to wonder where my loyalties lay. “Just odd that youended up solo,” he said. I explained that I’d been trying to leave the door opento a more candid one-on-one, that I hadn’t known Greenberg would join. “Justdon’t want them isolating us,” McHugh said, warily.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]As I arrived home from work one day early that August, my superintendent, squatand square-jawed and graying, approached me under the building’s awning. He wasannoyed.“You know these guys outside today?” he said, in an Albanian accent.“What guys?” I asked.“Eh, two guys. In car. Smoking by car. All the time.”I looked up and down the block. The street was mostly empty. “Why do you thinkthey were here for me?”He rolled his eyes. “Ronan. Is always you. You move in, address printeverywhere, now I have no peace.”I told him I was sure it was just TMZ guys on a slow day. “If they come back,I’ll bring them coffee and ask them to leave,” I said. He shook his head andlooked at me doubtfully.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]It was clear that we could bring in more reporting if NBC wanted it. “I knowyou’d been considering taking that last step and doing an interview showing yourface,” I told Nestor in a call as the review progressed. “I hate to put this onyou, but it could be important if you do.”“I’m applying for jobs. I’m just not sure,” she said.“I wouldn’t be asking if I didn’t think it might make the difference here.”She thought for a moment. “If it winds up being that important, I’m open to it,”she said. “I’d do it.”Despite the strange signals from our bosses, McHugh and I kept working. Hehelped with research, clicking over to other browser windows as Greenberg walkedby. I stayed up late, calling Weinstein’s former employees around the world. Ineeded the kind of big break that could shatter the halt on reporting.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Leaving home one morning, I spotted something outside that made me stopabruptly: a silver Nissan Pathfinder I felt sure I’d seen before in the samespot. Other residents made their way into the sunlight. My neighbor who looked alittle like me smiled as he passed. I stood there feeling ridiculous. There werea million reasons for two guys to be parked near Columbus Circle a few times aweek, I reminded myself. But I decided I’d have more privacy working from homeanyway, and went back upstairs.It was a minute after noon when the call from Greenberg came in.“How’s the script?” he asked. I’d been revising it according to Harris’sspecifications.“It’s rock-solid,” I said. “And we’re continuing to field any relevant incomingcalls from sources, of course.”“Legal called and they want you to pause reporting,” he said.This again, I thought.“Why?” I asked. “I assumed, since they gave us a green light to go ahead withRose—”“No, we’re paused. How’s your book? Interviews going well?”Greenberg had never shown any interest in my book. We talked about CondoleezzaRice for a few minutes before I said, “Rich, about stopping reporting—”“I gotta go,” he interjected. “I’m flying to see my dad. I’ll be gone allweekend. We can talk next week.”And then he was gone.“Greenberg called,” I texted McHugh. “Legal wants us to stop any new calls. Sobe discreet.”“Oh shit,” he wrote back. “Why?”It didn’t make sense. Discouragement was one thing, but there was no rationale,journalistic or legal, for ordering us to stop reporting. I called Greenbergagain.“Rich, I’m sorry to bother you again, I just need some clarification here. What,exactly, did ‘legal’ say? Who in legal? Why?”“I don’t know, I’m not a lawyer. I really have to go now, I have to catch myflight,” he said quickly. As if to leaven the tone, he added, “Sorry, man.”I was responding when he hung up. The call had lasted all of thirty-sevenseconds.I paced my apartment. I called Harris’s office, said it was urgent, didn’t hearback. My phone chimed: another message from Diana Filip of Reuben CapitalPartners, entreating me to meet about my reporting on gender issues.Leaving home that afternoon, I edged up to the front door, where I’d seen thecar. Nothing there. You look like a damn fool, I thought to myself. But I wasstarting to take precautions. I was memorializing sensitive information inlonghand form. I was moving new documents into the safe-deposit box. Eventually,I’d consult John Tye, a former whistle-blower on government surveillancepractices who founded a nonprofit law office called Whistleblower Aid. He set meup with an iPod Touch with only an encrypted messaging app installed, connectedto the internet through an anonymous Wi-Fi hot spot purchased with cash. Itsnumber was registered to a pseudonym. Mine was “Candy.”“Oh, come on,” I said, incredulous.“I don’t pick the names,” Tye said, all serious.“I sound like a nice Midwestern girl who should not have moved to LA.”“I don’t pick the names.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter024]PAUSE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter024]“I’ve been waiting for this call,” a crisp English accent was saying. AllyCanosa, who’d worked for Weinstein since 2010, immediately confirmed she’d beenaware of the pattern of honeypot meetings. And there was more: “I was sexuallyabused by Harvey Weinstein,” she said. “Repeatedly.” I took a risk, showed mycards, told Canosa exactly what I had.“Oh my God,” she said, beginning to break down. “It’s finally going to comeout.”When I asked if she’d go on camera, she sounded frightened, but open to theidea. “I want to help,” she said. “Let’s talk.” She agreed to meet me in LosAngeles in person. She was available that weekend. When a source offers you abreak like that, you grab it.I started the process of booking a plane ticket, then stopped. It was a Thursdayafternoon. To make it to the meeting with Canosa over the weekend, I’d need tofly out soon. But Greenberg had just issued his latest order to stop reporting,this time invoking the legal department.McHugh again suggested asking for forgiveness, not permission. “If you don’texplain this to anybody, you guarantee this meeting, and you can see her thisweekend and have a talk, and maybe convince her to go on camera. If you tellthem, you let people far more powerful than we are in this scenario dictate whathappens.” But going truly rogue, rather than just keeping under the radar, as wehad that spring, felt like a bridge too far. I called Weiner and told her theinterview was important. Then I sent an email pleading for permission tocontinue reporting.No one replied. “They are prob talking,” McHugh texted. “Try to put it out ofmind.”I waited a day, then booked my ticket to LA.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]It was raining again the next morning, an oppressive gray drizzle. McHugh calledfrom the office early as I threw unfolded clothes into a suitcase. “Didn’t yousay Greenberg was getting on a flight yesterday?” McHugh asked. He was speakingunder his breath.“Yeah,” I said. “He had to get off in a hurry.”“Funny,” he said. “’Cause he’s here.”“Maybe his flight got canceled.”“Maybe.”I was putting the luggage into the trunk of a sedan when Greenberg tried me.Then he texted: “Call me ASAP.”“Hi,” I said. “I’m on the way to the airport.”“What?!” he said. He sounded like he was about to leap out of his skin. “I haveto get Susan on the phone.” Then she joined, speaking slowly and carefully. “Wehave discussed your email about this weekend’s meeting. The company would liketo put a pause on all reporting and contact with sources.”“All contact with sources?” I asked, incredulous. There was a heaviness to theseconversations now, a strange sense that we were not just speaking to each otherbut also turning out, just a bit, to the crowd that might someday scrutinize ourdecisions. I felt this, and then felt it might be self-aggrandizing. But it gaveme a strange kind of authority to push them to say what they hoped to leavebetween the lines.“I don’t understand,” I continued. “Has anyone at any point raised any issuewith the reporting or how I’ve acted?”“No, no,” Greenberg said.“Is there any question about the news value of this woman offering to discuss aserious allegation of sexual abuse by a prominent person?”“That’s, well—that’s above my pay grade,” he managed.“Okay. So where’s this coming from? Is this an order from legal?” I asked.There followed a silence that felt endless.“It’s not—” Weiner began.“You should know this comes directly from Noah,” Greenberg said.“So legal hasn’t made a determination that I should stop reporting?”“Noah has made a determination that we should pause reporting and contact withsources.”“No one has expressed a rationale as to why it would place us in any jeopardy toallow reporting to continue, with full caution and in full consultation withlegal. Did he articulate any reason why?”“Well, if I—if I had to guess, from my standpoint,” Weiner stammered, “I’d sayone might want to review what we, uhh, what we have now before continuing withanything new.” She assembled this sentence like she was reading characters offof a newly unearthed cuneiform tablet.“This isn’t new,” I said stubbornly, referring to the meeting with Canosa. “It’sbeen scheduled.”The phone vibrated—McHugh calling. I declined the call, tapped in a text. “On wGreenberg and Weiner.”“Should I join?” he responded. It felt like a rescue operation.“Maybe poke head in,” I wrote.“In light of what Noah said, we think you should not be meeting with anysources,” Greenberg was saying.McHugh texted to say Greenberg had waved away the attempt to enter his office.No rescue.“I can’t prevent sources from reaching out to me,” I told Greenberg.“We understand that,” he said.I said nothing about whether I would obey the order to cancel the meeting,agreeing instead to keep them apprised of what Canosa told me “if” we had anycontact. I’d never experienced this before: pretending I wasn’t contactingsources, feigning reluctance to hear back from them.“I think she will very possibly agree to go on camera,” I said. “And if shedoes, I’ll feel strongly about proceeding with that.”“We’d—we’d have to go back to Noah on that,” Greenberg said.I got off the call feeling disoriented. I called Jonathan.“This is insane,” he said.“I don’t think I can risk trying to cancel another interview,” I said.“You and Rich McHugh need to start writing each other memos. Detaileddescriptions of all of this, sent in real time. They’re saying incriminatingshit.”I looked out of the car window at a snarl of bumper-to-bumper traffic outsideJFK. “This is all fine for you guys,” Jonathan was saying. “As long as you keepgoing, as long as you keep reporting.”“Easy for you to say,” I told him. “I’m pissing them off with this stuff. I’mgoing to be unemployed soon at this rate.”“Who cares?! Look at what’s happening! No one on these calls wants to own any ofthis, because it’s so obviously bad! It’s like a reverse Murder on the OrientExpress. Everyone wants it dead, nobody wants to stab it!”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Back at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, McHugh, still lingering outside Greenberg’soffice, knocked again.“What’s going on?” McHugh said.“Noah has asked us to pause our reporting while we see what we have and thelegal review takes place,” Greenberg told him.“I just don’t understand that,” McHugh said.Greenberg hadn’t offered any explanations on the phone with me, and he didn’toffer any to McHugh. He rattled off a list of Weinstein’s lawyers—CharlesHarder, David Boies, and, a new name McHugh hadn’t heard in connection withWeinstein before, Lanny Davis. “Not that we’re afraid of any of them,” Greenbergadded. “But for the time being you have to stop any calls about this.” As I had,McHugh said he couldn’t stop incoming calls, and left it at that.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]As I arrived at JFK, Canosa called. She sounded nervous. “You’re still coming totown?” she asked. I stopped for a moment, anxious travelers dragging heavyluggage coursing around me. I thought how easy it would be to tell her no, totake the order from our bosses, to safeguard the relationships with Greenbergand Oppenheim.“Ronan?” she asked again.“Yeah,” I told her. “I’m coming.”From the plane, I put the finishing touches on the script, trading notes withMcHugh about a word choice in my narration or an edit on a sound bite. Evenpared down to the elements the legal department had reviewed and sanctioned, itwas explosive. “I’m used to that,” said Weinstein near the top, as Gutierrez,panicked, tried to escape. “NBC NEWS HAS EXCLUSIVELY OBTAINED AUDIO COLLECTEDDURING THE NYPD STING,” I narrated. Gutierrez was named, her story told indetail, followed by a summary paragraph: “NBC NEWS HAS SPOKEN TO FOUR OTHERWOMEN WHO HAVE WORKED FOR WEINSTEIN AND WHO ALLEGE SEXUAL MISCONDUCT…ALLEGATIONS DATING FROM THE LATE 1990S TO JUST THREE YEARS AGO.” Nestor’sinterview was included, and the messages from Reiter corroborating her claim,and sound bites from the executives, describing firsthand recollections ofmisconduct.I attached to the script a note that I hoped would put our bosses at NBC onnotice about Canosa:Rich,Attached please find the script, revised according to Kim and Susan’s enumeratedconcerns, and your subsequent suggestions, which have been followed veryprecisely.Please note that one additional former assistant has raised a credible firsthand allegation of sexual abuse and claims to have a paper trail relevant to ourreporting. She has expressed a willingness to participate in this story and isdeciding in what capacity.RonanAfter the email went out to Greenberg and Weiner, I felt antsy. I depressed thebutton on my seat and tested the limits of its recline a few times. It felt likewe were standing still while the outside world accelerated. While I was on theflight, HuffPost ran a story about claims that the Fox News host Eric Bollinghad sent lewd texts to coworkers. The story had used entirely anonymoussourcing—something that had never been the case in any draft of ours. The sameafternoon, the Hollywood Reporter announced that Harvey Weinstein, for his“contributions to public discourse and the cultural enlightenment of society,”would be receiving the LA Press Club’s inaugural Truthteller Award."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter025]PUNDIT [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter025]I met Ally Canosa at a restaurant way out on the east end of Sunset Boulevard.She sat perfectly upright, every muscle in her body tensed. Like many of thesources in the Weinstein story, she was pretty in a way that would have beenstriking in most settings, but was just a criterion for employment in Hollywood.Canosa wasn’t sure what to do. She had signed a nondisclosure agreement as acondition of her employment with Weinstein. She was still trying to make it as aproducer, and was terrified of retaliation. Weinstein could render herunemployable. And then there were the hesitations of any survivor of sexualviolence. She’d allowed her wounds to calcify and learned to carry on. Shehadn’t told her father, or her boyfriend. “I don’t want to suffer more. Youknow?” she told me. Once, as she’d worked up the nerve to raise the matter witha therapist, “I saw her at a premier for a Weinstein movie,” Canosa told me. “Ifound out she was a producer on one of Harvey’s movies.”Canosa had met Weinstein the better part of a decade earlier, when she wasworking as an event planner at the West Hollywood branch of the members-onlyclub Soho House. She’d organized an event for the Weinstein Company, and he’dspotted her, stared, and then handed her his business card. At first, Weinsteinalmost stalked Canosa, demanding to meet again and again. When she was “creepedout” and didn’t respond, he forced her hand, demanding a formal meeting throughSoho House, ostensibly to discuss another event.At the Montage hotel, their midday meeting was moved to a hotel suite, andWeinstein laid into her with his familiar promises of career advancementfollowed by sexual overtures. “You should be an actress,” she remembered himsaying. “You have a face.” When he asked, “You’re not gonna kiss me?” she saidno and left, flustered.She kept trying to ignore him, but he was persistent, and she was fearful of theimpact he might have on her career if she spurned him. She agreed to meet again.During dinner at a hotel restaurant, Eva Cassidy’s cover of “Autumn Leaves”drifted over the stereo system. Canosa talked about Cassidy’s life story, andWeinstein proposed developing a biopic about her, with Canosa’s help. After themeal, he grabbed her by the arm, pressed her against a railing on the stepsoutside, and kissed her hard. She was horrified.But afterward, Weinstein “made a big show of being apologetic,” she said. “Wecan just be friends,” she remembered him telling her. “I really wanna make thismovie with you.” He set up a call with a veteran producer of his, and prettysoon they were meeting with rights holders and exchanging script notes.“I called my parents and was like, ‘Oh my God. You would not believe what justhappened. Harvey Weinstein wants me to help him produce a movie about an idea Igave him,’” she recalled. “So naïve. Look, it’s embarrassing just talking aboutit. But at the time I was like, ‘This is all I ever wanted.’”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Canosa took time to get to these points. After our meeting at the restaurant,she said she’d be more comfortable in private, and came to Jonathan’s place inWest Hollywood. It was the start of a trend that would soon see more and moredistraught sources traipsing through his doors. Pundit, the Goldendoodle mymother had given Jonathan, curled up next to Canosa as she continued the story.The first year they’d worked together, Canosa had tried repeatedly to brush offWeinstein’s advances. During one meeting about the Cassidy film, he casuallytold her he needed to go up to his hotel room to get something. “It was likemidafternoon or something. So, I just didn’t think,” she said. When they gotthere, he told her he was going to take a shower. “Would you get in the showerwith me?” he asked.“No,” Canosa told him.“Just get in the shower with me. I don’t even need to—I don’t want to have sexwith you. I just want you to be in the shower with me.”“No,” she said again, and went into the living room. Weinstein announced, fromthe bathroom, that he was going to masturbate anyway, and started doing sothrough the open door as she averted her gaze. She left Weinstein’s hotel room,upset.Another time, Weinstein left a jacket behind at one of their meetings and askedher to hold onto it. In its pockets, she found a pack of syringes that googlingrevealed were a treatment for erectile dysfunction. She reeled at theimplications of him arming himself for sex ahead of their meetings.By then she was working on the film for Weinstein; her professional life hadcome to revolve around him. And they had developed a friendship that was real,if twisted by imbalances of power and by Weinstein’s overtures. At one workdinner with a number of colleagues that summer, he wept over news that Disneywould be selling Miramax. He asked her, yet again, to come to his hotel room.When she refused, he roared at her, “Don’t fucking refuse me when I’m crying.”She relented, and nothing happened. He just sobbed. “I’ve never been happy,” sheremembered him saying. “You’re one of my best friends. You’re so loyal.” Shehoped the declarations of friendship meant he understood her boundaries. She waswrong.“What came next,” she said, beginning to cry, “was he raped me.” The first timehad been after another meeting in a hotel. As they discussed the Cassidyproject, he said a scene in the script reminded him of a classic film, and askedher to come up to his room to watch a clip. Weinstein had by then apologized forhis advances profusely and he was, after all, her boss. “I was like, I canhandle myself,” she said. The only television in Weinstein’s hotel room was inthe bedroom. She sat on the bed and watched the clip, feeling uncomfortable. “Hemade a move, and I told him, ‘No.’ And he made another move, and I told him,‘No,’” she recalled. Weinstein got angry, aggressive. “Don’t be a fuckingidiot,” she remembered him saying. He departed for the restroom and returned afew minutes later wearing only a robe. Then he pushed her onto the bed. “I saidno more than once, and he forced himself on me,” she said. “It wasn’t like I wasscreaming. But I was definitely like, ‘I don’t want to do this.’ And his fullbody weight was on top of me.”Canosa lingered on what she could have done differently. “In my head at thetime, it was like I didn’t put up enough of a fight.” Eventually, she stoppedsaying no. “I was just numb. I wasn’t crying. I was just staring at theceiling.” It was only after she left that she started sobbing and couldn’t stop.Weinstein hadn’t used protection. He had told her, to her great discomfort,months earlier, how he’d gotten a vasectomy. But she was terrified he might havegiven her an STD. She thought of telling her boyfriend but felt too ashamed.“Looking back, I would drag myself kicking and screaming straight to the policeif I could.”As she broke down telling the story, Pundit leapt up, concerned, trying to lickCanosa’s face. She laughed, relieved to have the tension of the momentpunctured. “This is the sweetest dog I think I’ve ever met,” she said.Canosa kept working for Weinstein. “I was in a vulnerable position and I neededmy job,” she told me. Later, when she lost her job at a different productioncompany, she signed a formal contract with the Weinstein Company, working onawards campaigns for The Artist and The Iron Lady.Weinstein’s misconduct continued. Once, he ordered her to accompany him to anappointment with an osteopath and to remain in the room as he stripped naked andreceived treatment for a worsening case of sciatica. Another time, during anattack of the same condition, he demanded that she massage his thighs. Sheremembered him screaming at her when she refused. “What the fuck? Why aren’t yougonna? Why?”“Because I don’t feel comfortable,” she told him. “I’m your employee.”“For fuck’s sake, Ally!” he shouted. “For fuck’s sake, you can massage mythighs!”“I’m just not going to.”“Then fucking get out of here! Fuck you! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!”When she was working on the production of the Netflix series Marco Polo,Weinstein arrived on set in Malaysia and wreaked havoc. At a dinner for thedirectors and producers, he demanded, in front of her coworkers, that she go tohis hotel room. When she tried to go instead to her own room, the barrage oftexts from his assistants started up: “Harvey wants to see you, Harvey wants tosee you.” Sometimes her efforts to evade him failed, and more assaults followed.Later, court documents would itemize “oral sexual conduct or anal sexual conductwith plaintiff by forcible compulsion and/or when plaintiff was incapable ofconsent by reason of being physically helpless.”All around Canosa, there were signs that she wasn’t alone. During that samevisit to the set of Marco Polo, Weinstein went into the dressing room of oneactress for fifteen minutes, “and then she was a ghost of herself for a weekafterwards.” Canosa felt a moral obligation to do something but was terrified byWeinstein’s displays of vindictiveness. “The number of times I’ve seen peoplehave their lives threatened, or their wives threatened, or their reputationthreatened,” she said, shaking her head.I tried to be honest with Canosa about the precariousness of the story, and theimportance of her participation to its future. I said, as I had so many timesthat summer, that the decision was hers; that all I could do was tell her howsincerely I believed talking would make a difference for a lot of people. By theend of our conversations, she was edging tantalizingly close to saying yes togoing on camera."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter026]BOY [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter026]It was early evening and the shadows were lengthening in Harvey Weinstein’soffices on Greenwich Street when the call came in. “Can you get Harvey?” saidGeorge Pataki, the former New York governor. An assistant made the connection.“Hey, Harvey, it’s George. I just want to let you know, Ronan Farrow’s stillworking on the story.”“That’s not what I hear,” Weinstein said.Pataki insisted that multiple women were talking to me. “He’s ready to go withit. It’s supposed to get aired—”“When?” Weinstein asked. “When is it supposed to get aired?”“Two to three weeks,” Pataki said.Nowhere was Weinstein more deeply enmeshed in politics than in New York. Between1999 and that summer in 2017, he and his company had given to at least thirteenNew York politicians or their PACs. He’d covered his bases, mostly withDemocrats but also occasionally with Republicans like Pataki. He’d been generouswith Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, andGovernor Andrew Cuomo.For Weinstein and Pataki, as had been the case with Hillary Clinton, campaigncontributions had helped foster friendship. The former governor was oftenphotographed at the movie mogul’s events. Weinstein helped boost the career ofPataki’s daughter, Allison, an historical novelist. A year before Pataki’s call,Weinstein hosted a book party for her. The year before that, when her husbandsuffered a stroke, Weinstein helped secure the right specialists. AllisonPataki’s book agent, Lacy Lynch, also worked with McGowan. As the summer woreon, Lynch’s name began showing up on Weinstein’s email and call lists.Weinstein had kept up his calls to Boies about the NBC problem. After hisconversation with Lack, he’d continued to reach out to NBC executives, and hadconfidently reported back to people around him that the story was dead. But itwasn’t long before he called Boies back, sounding less certain. “I think NBC isstill working on a story,” he said. He sounded angry. “I’m going to get to thebottom of this.”After hearing from Pataki, Weinstein placed a fresh round of calls to PhilGriffin, Andy Lack, and Noah Oppenheim. He’d shouted the names so often—“Get mePhil, get me Andy, get me Noah”—the assistants had taken to calling them “thetriumvirate.” By that August, Weinstein’s attention was increasingly turning toOppenheim. But Griffin, whom Weinstein told his staff he knew best, had been anobject of early and intense focus, and continued to be a mainstay.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Griffin’s carefree qualities contributed to his considerable charm. They couldalso, however, be a source of discomfort for colleagues. He had a temper, andcursed like a sailor. He was notorious for his hard drinking after work. Whilehe was a senior producer at Nightly News in the nineties, he’d often retireafter work to Hurley’s, a Midtown bar. After a few drinks one night, he toldthree women producers with him that he wanted to go to Times Square.“I want to go see the lights at Times Square! I love to see the lights!” onerecalled Griffin saying.Griffin moved the drinking to a Times Square hotel. Then the group stumbled overto Eighth Avenue, where Griffin urged the women to come with him to see a peepshow. Two of them exchanged uncomfortable glances. He told them to lighten up.In they went, to a circle of darkened booths upstairs, where a window opened anda woman, naked but for her heels, squatted in front of them and asked Griffinfor some cash to continue the show.Griffin looked at the women with what one described as “a flicker of shame.” Hetold the stripper no thanks. The window closed, and the group headed out toexchange awkward goodbyes. For the women, the incident had been gross, butunremarkable: they’d all come up in the business with this kind of behavior frommen.Four colleagues said Griffin was known for making lewd or crass remarks in workemails. In one meeting I’d been in after the television personality MariaMenounos’s vagina had been photographed in a bathing suit wardrobe malfunction,Griffin waved around a printed page bearing a zoomed-in image, smirking. “Wouldyou look at that?” he said, and exhaled hard. “Not bad, not bad.” On a couchnearby, the female employee in the room with us rolled her eyes.Griffin seemed to see the news purely as a business, and evinced for journalismlittle of the fervor he held for sports. When the winds of the industry blew infavor of partisanship, he pushed his anchors toward opinion; when partisanshipwore thin, he was the first to turn to straight news. And when you subjected himto any kind of rigorous discussion of reporting, he’d squint at you and lookconfused.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]But Griffin did become passionate when a business interest was on the line.Once, while I was co-hosting a charity concert called the Global CitizenFestival—a big, earnest, low-rent Live Aid—I interviewed the concert’s headlineact, No Doubt. One of the festival’s goals that year was promoting vaccination,even as the anti-vaxxer movement in the United States was producing adherentsand measles outbreaks. I asked Gwen Stefani if she vaccinated her kids, and howshe felt about the anti-vaxxers. She said she supported vaccines and advisedpeople to talk to their doctors. Mike Wallace at your door this was not. Butback at Rockefeller Plaza, assembling the spot in edit, I got a call from anMSNBC producer working on the concert.“Stefani’s people have reviewed the transcript, and they’d like some edits,” shesaid.“Who sent them a transcript?”“I—I don’t know.”In my in-box was a redlined script, with Stefani’s sound bites rearranged andtrimmed to make it sound like she was ambivalent to negative on the vaccinefront. I told the producer I wouldn’t air it.Pretty soon I was in Griffin’s office with him and another member of his team.“What the fuck?” he asked, exasperated.I looked at the proposed script in front of me.“Phil, I’m not gonna edit sound bites to change their meaning.”“Why not?!” he said, like this was the craziest thing he’d ever heard.“It’s not ethical?” I offered, less as a statement and more as a kind ofreminder, hoping Griffin’s question had been rhetorical and he’d finish thethought. Instead, he leaned back in his chair and directed a “Lord give mestrength” look at his colleague.She tried a gentler tone. “We all know you care a lot about the”—she hesitatedhere, seeming to genuinely struggle to find a nice way to put it—“ journalismwith a capital J, but this is not some sensitive political story.”“It’s a puff piece!” Griffin chimed in. “Come on. What the fuck?”“There are literally kids dying over this issue. She’s a famous person. Sincewhen do we send transcripts of interviews outside the building anyway?”“We don’t know how that happened—” his colleague began.“Who cares?” Griffin interjected, impatient. “You know what happens if we don’tmake these edits? Stefani’s threatening to pull out! That’s straight from hermanager.”“That’s who made these edits?”Griffin blew past the question. “Point is, she pulls out, sponsors start to pullout, the network’s pissed…” The channel’s partnership with the Global CitizenFestival was, Griffin often remarked, bait to entice corporate sponsors. Forweeks, we would run branded segments about Unilever or Caterpillar.“So let’s not air it,” I said.“You have to air it,” said Griffin.“Why?”“It’s part of the deal with the sponsors, with her people—”“We ran this all the way up,” his colleague said, referring to the executivechain of command in the news group. “Your concerns are not shared.”Griffin said he’d tell me what he told another anchor trying to air a toughsegment about net neutrality—the principle that internet providers shouldn’tcharge different rates for different types of data on the internet, which ourparent company was lobbying against. “You wanna work for PBS and have completefreedom and make a hundred thousand bucks a year, be my guest,” he recalledtelling that anchor. “You wanna fight with me on what’s good for the bottomline, I’ll be happy to put your salary numbers out in the press.”I considered quitting. I called Tom Brokaw, who said I under no circumstancescould air sound bites with deceptive edits, and gave me the same warning aboutfucking my credibility that he’d later lay on me during the Weinstein reporting.Then I called Savannah Guthrie, who had a knack for cutting through bullshit.“What about just not airing that part of the interview?” she suggested.“I mean, it was most of the interview,” I said.“Just find something else to air.”It was simple and, in hindsight, obvious advice—don’t air the deceptive part,but don’t self-immolate over a singer’s backstage interview. Picking the rightfights was a lesson I could be slow to learn. In the end, I sat at the anchordesk and aired a five-minute clip of small talk with No Doubt. I felt neitherhella good nor hella bad.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Two years later, as Weinstein continued his calls to the triumvirate ofexecutives, he reached Griffin.“I thought this was done,” Weinstein said.“Harvey, it is,” Griffin responded.“You need to get your boy in line,” he said. He sounded angry.“Harvey,” Griffin said, defensive, “he’s not running it with us.” Later, Griffinwould deny he ever promised the story was killed.It was, by the estimate of multiple staffers in Weinstein’s office, one of atleast fifteen calls between Weinstein and the three NBC executives. And by latesummer, Weinstein’s mood after the calls had again become triumphal. Weinsteintold one of his legal advisors that he’d spoken to executives at the network,and that “they tell me they’re not doing the story.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter027]ALTAR [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter027]The news from the executive suites of NBCUniversal at first seemed good. Earlythat August, Greenberg called to report that legal had signed off on thepared-down version of the script. And from the editorial side, he added, “myview is everything in there is reportable.”“So we seek comment. We go into edit,” I said.“Reportable doesn’t mean it airs. Now it goes to Noah and Andy.”“But surely if legal approved, and you consider it reportable—”“What they decide’s above my pay grade,” he said. “There may be questions thathave nothing to do with what’s reportable. They may have concerns about whetherit’s good TV. You know, you have an incredible print piece, an incredible VanityFair story here.”“I—what?” was all I managed.“You know, it’d make a perfect Vanity Fair story,” he repeated.Later, McHugh and I sat in a conference room and puzzled over the comment.“Maybe he’s right,” he said heavily. “Maybe you save this by taking it tosomewhere else.”“Rich, you know if that happens, you get screwed.” He had produced the hell outof the story, as a television piece. We’d shot, by this point, eight on-camerainterviews. All of that would fall by the wayside in the scenario Greenberg hadlightly proposed. And even if I wanted to take it elsewhere, would it bepossible? The footage was owned by NBCUniversal and, in turn, the ComcastCorporation.“We’re running this here,” I said firmly. “Produced by you.”McHugh said, “Okay,” and sounded less certain.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]It rained ceaselessly that day. In my in-box, inquiries unrelated to theWeinstein story piled up. Diana Filip, the investor with the women’s rightsproject, sent another email, this time through my agents at CAA. The messagesrelated to the story were more anxiety-inducing. One arrived, blunt and short,from Auletta:RonanmHarvey status?kenI made my way down through the bowels of 30 Rock, onto a D train. It wassparsely populated, despite the rain. I saw something, or thought I did, andfroze. There, in profile, seated on my side at the opposite end of the car, wasa bald head that I swore I’d seen in the Nissan. I could make out the same paleface and snub nose. I couldn’t be sure. My most rational self thought, You’reseeing things. But as the train stopped, I felt uncomfortable enough to slip outbefore my station. I pushed onto the crowded platform, looking over my shoulder.Outside, New York was a dreamscape, streets and buildings and people suspendedin mist and rain. I walked fast, stopping at a CVS, scanning to see if Irecognized anyone from the subway car or the platform. When I emerged, the lightwas failing. I came to the familiar fortress-like church near my apartment, andmoved quickly up the steps, and walked through the doors. Where my damp shirthadn’t adhered to my body, rain rolled down the small of my back, my chest, myarms. The nave was smaller than I’d expected from the outside. Under imposingstained-glass windows, an altar loomed. I stood in front of it, feeling out ofplace. By the altar was a seal, in inlaid marble, showing a book and a swordover a diagram of the earth: the coat of arms of Saint Paul. “PRAEDICATORVERITATIS IN VNIVERSO MUNDO.” I had to google the translation later: “A preacherof truth to the whole world.”“We’ve been watching you,” said a heavily accented voice next to me, and Ilurched. It was an older woman with dark hair. Next to her was a younger woman.They looked alarmed at my reaction. “We’ve been watching,” she said again. “Fromthe beginning. Your show. My daughter is a big fan.”“Oh,” I said. “Thank you.” And then, collecting myself, managed a smile and astock joke about low ratings: “You and my mom and no one else.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]I had arrived home when Berger, my agent at CAA, called. “Ronan!” he boomed.“How’s it going?”“I’m fine,” I said.“You’re better than fine, you’re fantastic,” he said. And then, a littlequieter, descending into brisk efficiency, “Look, I don’t know the details ofthis big story—”“Did Noah mention it?” I asked. Berger was agent to both of us, and closer toOppenheim.“Ronan, I don’t know a thing,” he said. He reminded me that my contract wasabout to be up for renewal. “I’m just saying if this is causing you problems,prioritize the stuff that’s working.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]I chewed my lip for a second, then dialed my sister.“So how’s the story?” she asked.“I don’t know how it is, honestly.”“Don’t you have, like, literally a recording of him admitting to it?”“Yeah,” I said.“So—”“I’ve been pushing. I don’t know how much more I can push.”“So you’re going to drop it.”“It’s not that simple. I might have to prioritize other things while I figurethis out.”“I know what it’s like to have people stop fighting for you,” she said quietly.And there was a long silence before we said our goodbyes.It was dark by then. I looked at my phone and found Oppenheim had texted: “Let’stalk tomorrow. When’s good?” I went over to my laptop and opened up a MicrosoftWord document. “OTHER STORIES,” I typed, and then hit Delete a few times andreplaced “OTHER” with “UPCOMING.” I pasted in bullet points for two stories wewere in the midst of shooting, on health care consolidation and opioid-dependentinfants, and a handful of others Oppenheim had liked before, including a “Viceytravelogue” on Facebook’s server farm deep in the permafrost of Luleå, Sweden.“It looks like a Bond villain’s lair,” I had written of the server farm, andother escapist TV pablum followed. Luleå is one of the busiest ports in Swedenand a major hub of its steel industry, but of this I knew nothing. I waspicturing a place big and brisk and empty, where a person could breathe, and youcould see the northern lights.At 30 Rock, McHugh stepped into an elevator, turned to find Weiner standing nextto him, and smiled. But as she said hello back, she flinched and looked at herfeet."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 28: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter028]PAVONINE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter028]During my years at 30 Rock, the third-floor waiting area outside of the newsexecutives’ offices cycled through several arrangements of furniture. ThatAugust, there was a low chair and a little table with a fan of the kind ofmonths-old magazines that tend to ornament waiting rooms. A Time cover,jet-black with blood-red lettering, asked, “Is Truth Dead?” It was an homage toa classic ’60s Time cover that read “Is God Dead?” but not as good. It had beenan impossible task: “Truth” just didn’t fit like “God” did, despite valiantefforts at kerning. I looked at it, then went over to Oppenheim’s assistant,Anna, to make small talk. “Guess you guys are working on something big,” shesaid, and gave me a conspiratorial, mum’s the word smile.When I walked into Oppenheim’s office, he didn’t rise or move to the couch asusual. He looked nervous. “So where’s your head at?” I asked. I had, folded inone hand, the print-out of the alternative stories list. Maybe Berger was right.Maybe I could turn from the terrible topic at hand, leaven things, refocus.Oppenheim shifted in his seat. “Well,” he said, picking up a copy of the script,“we have some anonymous sourcing in here.”“We’re leading with a woman we name, we’re showing her face, we’re hearing hervoice,” I said, referring to Gutierrez.He let out an exasperated breath. “I don’t know how credible she is. I mean, hislawyers are gonna say, they’re in a public place, nothing actually happens—”“But he admits to something having happened before, something serious andspecific.”“We’ve gone over this, he’s trying to get rid of her. And anyway, you say righthere”—he flipped to the relevant section of the script—“she’s got credibilityproblems.”“No,” I said. “We’ve got sources on the force, sources in the DA’s office,saying she was credible.”“It says right here in the approved script!” he said.“Noah, I wrote the script. We’re disclosing the stuff that got thrown at her.But the DA, the cops—”“The DA didn’t go with it! And he’s gonna say, she’s some hooker—”“Okay, so we disclose all of that. And we let the public listen and decide.”He shook his head, looked at the page again.“And it’s—how serious is this stuff, really?” he asked, as he had in each of ourconversations about the story.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]As we spoke, a conversation came back to me, from the year before, during thecampaign. At the NBC cafeteria, I’d sat with Oppenheim, a green juice in frontof me. He’d leaned in, a little more gossipy than usual, and said that women atNBC News had reported harassment by a Trump campaign official on the trail.“That’s a huge story!” I said.“We can’t tell it,” Oppenheim replied, with a shrug. “They don’t want to,anyway.”“Well, surely there’s a way to document it without violating confidences—”“It’s just not gonna happen,” he told me, as if to say, “that’s life,” with thenonchalance and confidence I so admired at the time—so much so that I didn’tgive it, or his wider views on sexual harassment, more thought.During his years as a writer at the Harvard Crimson, Oppenheim had styledhimself as a provocateur. He would pose as an earnest attendee at gatherings offeminist groups, then turn out fiery columns in the Crimson about how thesegroups were full of shit. While columnists don’t always write their ownheadlines, Oppenheim’s pieces had titles like “Reading ‘Clit Notes’” and“Transgender Absurd,” which accurately reflected their content. “There is noquestion that my most impassioned adversaries have been the members of organizedfeminist groups,” he wrote. “The vitriol of their rhetoric has gone unmatched.Of course, so has their hypocrisy. Apparently, it is easy to blame thepatriarchy for all of your woes, and to silence your opponents with accusationsof misogyny, but it is more difficult to actually deny oneself the pleasures ofcavorting with said patriarchy’s handsome sons. I will never forget the fatefulevening when I encountered the leader of one prominent women’s organizationemerging from the anteroom of the Porcellian,” an all-male social club. “Itseems that political dogmatism comes easy, so long as it does not interfere withone’s plans for Saturday night.”After attending a meeting related to the merger of Radcliffe, Harvard’s formerwomen’s college, with the main undergraduate school, young Noah Oppenheim wrote:“Why are women’s meetings any more deserving of protected space than anyoneelse’s?” In a column defending the good old days of same-sex clubs at Harvard,he argued, “To the angry feminists: There is nothing wrong with single-sexinstitutions. Men, just like women, need to themselves. We need a place to letour baser instincts have free reign, to let go of whatever exterior polish weaffect to appease female sensibilities.” He added that “women who fellthreatened by the clubs’ environments should seek tamer pastures. Howeverapparently women enjoy being confined, pumped full of alcohol and preyed upon.They feel desired, not demeaned.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Years had passed and Noah Oppenheim had matured. But, that day in 2017, as Iwatched him shift and gaze down, I had a sense that part of his vulnerability tocriticism of the story was a sincere belief: that this just wasn’t a huge deal,some Hollywood bully, famous in SoHo and Cannes, crossing a line.“Megyn Kelly did that story about women in tech, and we had a couch full ofwomen—” he was telling me.“If what you’re saying is you sincerely just want more, then tell me,” I said.“There’s more we can get in place quickly.”He seemed not to hear this. “The temp is in shadow,” he said.“She’ll go full face. She said she’ll do it if we need it.”He swallowed hard, laughed a little. “Well, I don’t know,” he said. “It dependswhat she has to say.”“We know what she has to say. She has evidence. She has messages from anexecutive within the company—”“Well, I don’t know if we want that, I don’t know—”“And there’s a third woman, as I’ve mentioned, with a rape allegation. Noah,she’s close to going on camera. If what you’re saying is we need more, I willget us more.”“Now, just a second, I don’t know if—we’d have to check with legal before we doanything like that.” He seemed frustrated, like he’d expected this to be easier.His face was going pale and slick, as it had when he listened to the audio.“That’s the problem, Noah,” I said. “Every time we try to get more, you guyspush back.”This seemed to make him angry. “Well, none of this matters,” he said. “We’ve gota much bigger problem.” He smacked onto the desk a printed page, then leanedback.I picked it up. It was a Los Angeles Times article from the early 1990s,describing Weinstein agreeing to distribute Woody Allen’s movies.“Harvey says you’ve got a huge conflict of interest,” Oppenheim said.I looked up from the page. “Harvey says?”Oppenheim’s gaze shifted off to the side again. “You know,” he said. “Harveytold Rich Greenberg. I never talked to Harvey.”“But we knew this,” I said, puzzled. “Greenberg and McHugh and I searched andfound he’d worked with both my parents—he worked with everyone in Hollywood.”“He worked with Woody Allen when he was a pariah!” He was raising his voice now.“A lot of distributors worked with him.”“It doesn’t matter. It’s not just about that, it’s—your sister was sexuallyassaulted. You wrote that Hollywood Reporter piece last year about sexualassault in Hollywood, it caused this splash.”“What are you arguing?” I asked. “That no one with a family member who’s beensexually assaulted can report on sexual assault issues?”He shook his head. “No,” he said. “This goes directly to the heart of your—youragenda!”“Do you think I have an agenda, Noah?” I had the same feeling I’d had in theconversation with Greenberg—that I had to ask direct questions, because it wasthe only way to expose the space between what he was willing to imply and whathe was willing to say.“Of course not!” Oppenheim said. “But I know you. That’s not what this is about,this is about public narrative, and the public narrative is gonna be ‘I letRonan Farrow, who just came out as this—this—sexual assault crusader, hating hisfather—’”“This wasn’t a crusade, it was an assignment. An assignment you gave me!”“I don’t remember that,” he said. “I don’t think I would have done that.”“Well, it’s true. I didn’t pitch this of my own initiative, and I didn’t reportit alone, either. This is something your whole news organization worked on.” Islid the printout back across the desk to him. “We knew he was gonna try tosmear me in some way,” I said. “If this is the best he’s got, honestly, I’mrelieved, and you should be, too.”“I’d be happier,” he said, agitated, “if he’d found video of you fucking in abathroom or something.” The friendship we’d had, which might have made this gayjoke merit an eye roll and a laugh, was giving way to something else, where hewas just a boss and a network head, and I was annoyed by it.“Insane!” Jonathan would later yell at no one in particular. “It’s insane forhim to actually present that article seriously. It’s not serious. It’s not areal objection. It’s fully fucking slimy.” Later, every journalist Iconsulted—Auletta, Brokaw even—would say that there was no conflict, that it wasa non-issue. What Oppenheim was describing was a journalist caring about atopic, not having a conflict with a specific person. Even so, I told him I’d bemore than happy to put a disclosure on the story.An almost pleading look crossed Oppenheim’s face. “I’m not saying there isn’t alot here. This is an incredible”—he searched for the end of the sentence—“anincredible New York magazine piece. And you know, you want to take it to NewYork magazine, go with God. Go with God.” He put up his hands in a gesture ofsurrender.I looked at him like he was crazy for a moment and then asked, “Noah, is thisstory dead or not?” He looked at the script again. Over his shoulder, I saw thedeco architecture of historic Rockefeller Plaza.I thought of my sister. Five years earlier, she’d first told the family shewanted to revive her allegation of sexual assault against Woody Allen. We’dstood in the TV room at our home in Connecticut, with stacks of fading VHStapes.“I don’t see why you can’t just move on,” I told her.“You had that choice!” she said. “I didn’t!”“We have all spent decades trying to put this thing behind us. I’m just nowtrying to launch something serious where people focus on the work. And you wantto—want to reset the clock completely.”“This isn’t about you,” she said. “Don’t you see that?”“No, it’s about you. You’re smart, you’re talented, you have so many otherthings you can do,” I said.“But I can’t. Because it’s always there,” she said, and then she was crying.“You do not need to do this. And you are ruining your life if you do.”“Fuck you,” she said.“I support you. But you just—you have to stop.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Oppenheim was looking up from the page. “I can go back to the group. But rightnow, we can’t run this.”Alan Berger’s creaky voice drifted through my mind. “Prioritize the stuff that’sworking.” I wondered if I had it in me to say “Okay,” to turn to other things,to focus on the future. In hindsight, it’s clear. But in the moment, you don’tknow how important a story is going to be. You don’t know if you’re fightingbecause you’re right, or because of your ego, and your desire to win, and toavoid confirming what everyone thought—that you were young, and inexperienced,and in over your head.I looked at the story list on my lap. I’d been gripping it so hard it wastwisted and moist with sweat. The words “looks like a Bond villain’s lair”peeked up at me. Just beyond my field of vision, the aurora flashed.Oppenheim was studying me. He said there couldn’t be any more work under theaegis of NBC News. He said, “I can’t have you going to any more sources.”I thought of McGowan under the TV lights, saying, “I hope they’re brave, too”;Nestor, falling into shadow, wondering, “Is this the way the world works?”;Gutierrez, listening as Weinstein said, “I’m used to that”; Annabella Sciorratelling me, “I’m sorry.”I looked at Oppenheim hard. “No,” I said.He looked annoyed.“Excuse me?”“No,” I said again. “I’m not going to—whatever you said. Stop contact withsources.” I balled up the page in my hand. “A lot of women have risked a lot toget this out, are still risking a lot—”“This is the problem,” he said, picking up volume. “You’re too close to this.”I considered whether this could be true. Auletta had said he had a “fixation” onthe story. I guessed I did too. But I had also grilled these sources. And I wasskeptical, ready to follow the facts wherever they led. And I was eager to go toWeinstein for comment, which I had not been allowed to do.“Okay. So I’m close to it,” I said. “So I care. We have evidence, Noah. And ifthere’s a chance of exposing this before it happens to anyone again, then Ican’t stop.” I wanted this to sound masculine and assertive, but I could hear myvoice cracking. “If you’re sending me packing, this is your news organization,and that’s your call,” I continued. “But you need to tell me.”“I’m not sending you packing,” he said, but he was looking away again. There wasa long beat, and then he shot me a wan smile. “This was fun. Wish we could goback to California poison water, right?”“Yeah,” I said. “Guess so.” I stood up and thanked him.I walked out of Noah Oppenheim’s office, into the elevator bank and past itsgiant chrome rendering of the NBC crest—a peacock that said, “NBC is in colornow. You can watch it in color. Isn’t that amazing?” And it was. It truly was. Imoved through the cubicles of the Today show newsroom and up the stairs to thefourth floor, with battery acid in my mouth and red parentheses in my palmswhere I had pressed nails into skin."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Art_P193.jpg]toc.xhtml#toc-part003"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter029]FAKAKTA [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter029]“Go with God,” Oppenheim had said. To New York magazine, of all places. (Only inManhattan media circles did heaven mean a middlebrow biweekly.) But how to gowith God when the interviews were locked up on NBC’s servers? I motioned McHughover to an empty office and told him what had just happened with Oppenheim.“This is why this guy continues to get off,” McHugh said. “So they were comingup with this argument with Weinstein’s lawyers, not telling us, waiting todeliver it like a… like a death nail,” he added, mixing metaphors. “They weretrying to get us to wrap up our reporting. That’s why nobody’s particularlyinterested in this recent victim that we’re talking to.” I looked at him,nodded. So this was the end. “It’s a bunch of bullshit,” he said. “What happenedhere at this company. It’s a big story.”“All the reporting,” I said wearily. “They own everything.”He looked at me hard.“Come here.”Back at our cubicles, McHugh glanced around, leaned to open a desk drawer.“Say,” he said, fumbling through a stack of AV paraphernalia and producing asilver rectangle, “you did have the interviews.” He slid across the desk a USBhard drive, with “Poison Valley” written in black Sharpie on one corner.“Rich…,” I said.He shrugged. “Backup.”I laughed. “They’re gonna fire you.”“Let’s be honest, neither of us is going to have a job after this.”I moved in like maybe I was gonna hug him and he waved me off. “Alright,alright. Just don’t let them bury this.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]A few minutes later, I was headed for the safe-deposit box at the bank, walkingquickly. I didn’t want to give Oppenheim the chance to reconsider his suggestionthat I take the story somewhere else. But whom to call? Looking at my phone, Isaw Auletta’s email from the previous day. If there was an outlet that knew thechallenges of going up against Weinstein, it was The New Yorker. I dialedAuletta.“They’re not running it? With what you have? The recording?” he asked. “That’sridiculous.” He told me he’d make some calls and get back to me.I’d been trying to reach Jonathan since after the meeting with Oppenheim. “Callme,” I wrote. Then, pettily: “I’m going through the biggest thing in my life andyou have not been there for me. I’m making critical decisions and I’m makingthem without you, which sucks. I step out of shoots for you, you don’treciprocate.”When he finally called, he was annoyed.“I can’t step out of meetings to these explosions of texts from you, it’sridiculous,” he said.“I’m just dealing with a lot,” I said. “And I feel like I’m doing it alone.”“You’re not alone.”“So come be with me.”“You know I can’t do that. We’re starting a company here, which barely registersfor you—”“There are weird things happening around me,” I said. “I feel like I’m goingcrazy.” We both got off the call in a huff. By then, I was descending into thesubterranean vault. I put the hard drive in the deposit box and watched as itslid back into place with a nails-on-chalkboard squeal.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The next day, Auletta introduced me to David Remnick, the editor of The NewYorker. Remnick and I set a time to talk the following week. “It’s an issue,” hewrote, “about which we have some experience.”At 30 Rock, anxiety pulsed through McHugh’s and my interactions in the newsroom.Greenberg seemed on edge. McHugh cornered him and expressed incredulity aboutthe conflict of interest argument. He reminded Greenberg that we’d looked atindustry connections between Weinstein and my family and determined there wasn’ta conflict of interest.Greenberg said vaguely that they’d find a way forward.“So this is not dead at NBC?” McHugh asked.“Look, I’m not going to debate this,” Greenberg replied.“I’m not debating,” McHugh said. “But I have to say, for the record, Idisagree.”When I saw Greenberg, likewise, I had questions. “This conflict of interestthing,” I said. “Noah said Harvey told you about it.”He found time in between looking panicked to appear sincerely puzzled.“I never talked about that with Harvey,” he said.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]It was early afternoon when Oppenheim texted, asking to meet. “I spent all dayhaving conversations about this,” he snapped, as I arrived in his office. Helooked like he hadn’t slept. “We all think that there’s a potential”—and then,evidently off my look of pirouetting optimism, he repeated—“ potentialsolution.” Whoever decided that the story couldn’t run had now, it seemed,realized the story couldn’t not run, either—at least not the way Oppenheim hadleft it the day before. “We’re going to have one of the most veteran seniorproducers in the company, a Dateline person who’s been here twenty, thirtyyears—we’re going to assign them to retrace everything you’ve done, scrubeverything.”“Who?” I said.“Corvo, who’s unimpeachable, is going to oversee it. He’s picking someone.”I thought of Corvo, the Dateline veteran—a company man, but, as far as I knew, aprincipled one.“If this is genuinely an effort born of wanting to run it, then I welcome it.Vet the hell out of it. The reporting holds up.”“It’s not just the checking,” Oppenheim said. “My view is that the tape andHarvey Weinstein grabbing a lady’s breasts a couple of years ago, that’s notnational news.” I started to talk and he held up a hand. “It’s news somewhere.Do it for the Hollywood Reporter, great, it’s news there. For the Today show, amovie producer grabbing a lady is not news.”He said they wanted more, and I said that was great too. I could take Gutierrezup on her offer to come in, and shoot with Canosa, and reshoot with Nestor.“No, no, no,” he said. “We’re picking this producer to vet things. Everyonewe’re considering is on vacation till Monday. Let’s just hang tight till then,”he said.“Noah, if you want more, I need to be able to go out and get it.”“I know, I know,” he said. “I’m just saying hang tight till Monday.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]“This is fakakt,” McHugh was saying.“Please, Rich, no more Yiddish, and it’s fakakta—”“It calls into question my credibility, which I fucking—”“No, it doesn’t,” I said.“How’s that? We have had a trusted producer vetting every element of this. I’vebeen there the whole time—”“Oh, sorry!” a chirpy young Today show producer said, opening the door. We werein a mailroom near the Today show bullpen. Everything else was full. Theproducer started sorting through mail and futzing with FedEx forms.We stood awkwardly for a moment.“So, life’s good?” I managed.“Yeah,” she said. “Great. You know. Sad the summer’s over.”“Sure,” I said.When the door swung shut behind her, I turned to McHugh. “Rich, I’m not gonnalet them force you out.”“But it is forcing me out,” McHugh continued under his breath. “What the hell isthis?”“Basically it’s a special prosecutor role, and if they wanna shut this thingdown, sure, they can, but it was very promising.”Rich looked at me like I was insane. “They said no, then they realized it’s a PRscandal. And now they’re just gonna rope-a-dope us to death until it’s March andwe’re still talking about this. Basically, ‘we need more, we need more’; they’renot gonna say no to us—It’s okay, come in.”“Sorry!” the producer squeaked, and tiptoed back over to grab some documentshe’d left behind.I smiled tightly, then said to McHugh, “Don’t you think that’s a littleconspiratorial? Maybe they’ll run it.”“Bottom line, it’s trouble that the president of NBC News is talking directlywith Harvey and lying to us about it.” He was sulking. “What are you gonna doabout the meeting with Remnick next week?”I thought about this. “I keep it, and we keep that option waiting in the wings.Potentially propose doing it for both. I don’t know.”“You’ve got to be careful now,” McHugh said, “because, say it does come out inanother publication, and it does look bad for NBC, they could so easily turn onus—”“Hello!” said one of three smiling interns who had just opened the door. “Don’tmind us.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Despite McHugh’s skepticism, I was lifted, as I left Rockefeller Plaza and mademy way through the harsh neons of Times Square, by newfound optimism. “NBC’s abird in the hand. As long as they’re letting you keep reporting, stick withthem,” Jonathan said, on the phone from Los Angeles. “Noah’s in over his head,he’s not malicious.”My feeling that the obstacles of the last month had been a passing fever dreamwas reinforced when Thomas McFadden, from NBC security, got back in touch to sayhe had an update. They’d figured out where at least some of the menacingmessages came from. It turned out I really did have your run-of-the-millstalkers with mental health issues. No grand conspiracies, no one lurkingoutside the apartment, I told myself.Harvey Weinstein’s mood was shifting too. In conversations with those aroundhim, he’d once again gone from jubilant claims that his contacts at NBC hadpromised the story was killed to concern that it hadn’t happened cleanly and Imight still be working. Weinstein knew Boies was friendly with Lack, and askedif the attorney might put in a call to the network head.“I can call Andy and see if he’ll tell me,” was all Boies would say.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]More sources were telling me that they were getting calls from Weinstein or hisassociates that they found unsettling. Katrina Wolfe, who had gone on camera tosay she’d witnessed the London settlement process, nervously told me that she’dgotten a call from a veteran Weinstein producer named Denise Doyle Chambers.Doyle Chambers said that she and another veteran producer, Pam Lubell, were backworking for Weinstein, conducting research for a book. A “fun book,” Lubellwould later say, “on the old times, the heyday, of Miramax.” Weinstein had askedthem to write down all the employees they knew and get in touch with them.Later, how much the two women believed this cover story would be a subject ofpublic speculation. Lubell, anyway, seemed to have convinced herself: she evenput together a book proposal. On its cover, Bob and Harvey Weinstein smiled inblack and white. The graphic above them read: “MIRAMAX: THOSE WERE THE DAYS MYFRIEND, I THOUGHT THEY’D NEVER END.”But the cover story, threadbare to begin with, quickly frayed. In early August,Weinstein called the two women back into the office. “You know what, we’re goingto put a hold on the book,” he said. He asked Doyle Chambers and Lubell to “callsome of your friends from the list and see if they got calls from the press.”On the phone with Wolfe, Doyle Chambers didn’t make much small talk about thegood old days before she came to the point. Weinstein wanted to know if Wolfehad heard from any reporters: if she’d heard, specifically, from me. And hewanted copies of any emails she’d received or sent. Wolfe, rattled, sent mymessages to Doyle Chambers and denied she’d ever responded to them.And there was something else: the names Doyle Chambers and Lubell compiled andcalled were being added to a larger master list. The list was light on insidersfrom the glory days, and heavy on women Weinstein had worked with, andtroublesome reporters. It was color coded: some names highlighted in red,indicating urgency, especially among the women. As Doyle Chambers and Lubellupdated the list based on their calls, they weren’t told that their work wasbeing sent to Black Cube’s offices in Tel Aviv and London, then onward tooperatives around the world, to serve as a basis for their increasingly involvedwork on Weinstein’s behalf.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]At the same time, John Ksar, an agent I worked with at the Harry Walker speakingagency, was fielding inquiries from a wealth management firm in London. Itsrepresentative, Diana Filip, said that she was planning a gala focused onwomen’s representation in the workplace. She wanted a reporter well-versed inthat issue to give a speech, or possibly even several.Ksar had been in the business a long time and was wise to attempts to fish forinformation. But Filip had all her answers lined up. She rattled off theparticulars, including the investors who would be in the room. She said that herfirm was still finalizing its decision. They’d need to meet with me first. “Ihope such a meeting could be arranged sometime in the coming weeks, in fact I’mplanning to be in NY next week so if Mr Farrow is available that might be a goodopportunity,” she wrote in an email. It was the first of several messages sayingthat a meeting had to happen promptly; and eventually, when this failed to gaintraction, that she’d settle for a call with me. For more than a month, theemails from Diana Filip kept coming. Ksar figured she was just really, reallyinto investigative reporting."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter030]BOTTLE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter030]The dawn after my latest meeting with Oppenheim, the private investigatorssettled in outside of my front door. Khaykin was already there when Ostrovskiyambled over from the bagel place around the corner. “Wang anything?” Ostrovskiyhad texted. “No man, Ty,” Khaykin replied. A few minutes later, they assumedtheir positions on the street outside, watching.Immediately after emerging from the meeting with Oppenheim, I’d sent an email toDavid Corvo, and we’d agreed to meet. Inside my apartment, I put on a whitebutton-down shirt, stuffed my notes into a bag, and headed out into the light.At just after eight thirty, the private investigators spotted a young man withfair hair, wearing a white shirt and carrying a knapsack. They scrutinized thefigure. They’d been given reference photos of me and, the day before, hadundertaken additional database searches. A lot of the surveillance business wasguesswork, but this looked like their mark. Ostrovskiy drove, rounding thecorner just after the target, recording on a Panasonic camcorder. “I’m headingto 30 rock for now,” he texted. Khaykin gave chase on foot, descending into theColumbus Circle subway stop, then getting on a downtown train.For the private investigators, long days of surveillance often meant fewopportunities for bathroom breaks. “How far are you?” Ostrovskiy texted his bosslater that day, while sitting in his car awaiting the next emergence of theirtarget. “I need to use a bottle. If you nearby I can wait.” Khaykin was not, itcame to pass, nearby. Ostrovskiy eyed the beverage he’d finished off earlier,resigned himself, picked it up, and went.“Ok all good now,” he texted his boss.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]By the time I made it to Rockefeller Plaza, I’d sweated through the white shirt.Corvo, in his office near the rest of the Dateline team, smiled and asked,“How’s it going?”“I gather we’re going to be working together,” I said.“Oh, that,” he said. “I’ve only gotten the broad strokes.”I ran Corvo through the basics: the audio, the numerous allegations againstHarvey Weinstein that had remained in the script after the legal review,Gutierrez’s unwavering willingness to be named and to lead the story, Nestor’sopenness to showing her face to replace McGowan. His head bobbed genially as helistened. “Sounds compelling,” he said, and smiled.Corvo had dealt with tough stories about sexual assault allegations before. In1999, during Andy Lack’s previous tenure at NBC News, Corvo had overseen thenetwork’s interview with Juanita Broaddrick, who had accused Bill Clinton ofrape twenty-one years earlier. The network had reviewed the interview for alittle more than a month after it was recorded, airing it only after Broaddrick,frustrated, had taken the story to the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post,and the New York Times. “If Dorothy Rabinowitz hadn’t come to interview me, Idon’t think NBC would ever have played it,” Broaddrick later said, referring tothe Wall Street Journal reporter who ultimately broke the story. “I hadabsolutely given up.”I was unaware that Corvo also had a personal history with sexual harassmentissues. In 2007, he’d appeared to fixate on one employee, sending her leeringmessages. “In our renewed effort to avoid misunderstandings,” he wrote, “we haveto get one ‘ground rule’ very clear: whenever you go to the pool, you must letme know. A long distance glimpse, even, will make my day.” On a hot day, he’dadded, “I love warm weather, but are you going to a school event dressed likethat?” Repeatedly, he’d find or create openings to be alone with the woman.Eventually she complained to management. She was promoted into a new role andstayed at the company for years after. Corvo’s ascent within the networkcontinued uninterrupted.I left the meeting with Corvo feeling reassured. The next day, unbeknownst tome, NBC finalized a nearly $1,000,000 separation agreement with Corvo’s accuser.When the Daily Beast later reported on the allegations, the network would saythat the payout had been a mere coincidence, unrelated to her complaint. Theagreement forbade her from ever speaking negatively about her time at NBC.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]A few mornings later, the private investigators were in position on the UpperWest Side again. This time, Ostrovskiy was on duty. “So far haven’t seen him,”he texted his boss. Then he spotted the young man with fair hair again.Ostrovskiy hopped out of his car and followed on foot. He drew close, withintouching distance. Then he frowned, punched a number into his phone.Upstairs in my apartment, I picked up. “Hello?” I said, and heard a briefexclamation in Russian, before the line went dead. In front of Ostrovskiy, theneighbor to whom I bore a passing resemblance walked on, blithely unaware,definitely not taking a call.“Seems like no march,” Ostrovskiy texted Khaykin. “Back at residence now.” Inhis car, he googled for better photos of me. “Found a good ID pic,” he wrote,and sent his boss a picture of me and my sister Dylan, aged four and six,perhaps, in our parents’ arms. “Going off this one we should be good.”“Lol,” replied Khaykin. Later, as if to make sure Ostrovskiy was kidding,Khaykin sent a screenshot from one of the dossiers with the blue Times New Romanheaders, showing my birthday.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The offices of The New Yorker encircled the thirty-eighth floor of One WorldTrade Center, an ouroboros of news and highbrow commentary and tote bags. It wasbright and airy and modern. My meeting with David Remnick was set for midday. AsI walked in, my phone played a scherzo of alerts. A series of new spam texts,this time asking me to opt into or out of some kind of political survey. Iswiped them away as a gangly assistant ushered me into the small conference roomadjoining Remnick’s office.David Remnick would someday be a hundred years old and they’d still call him awunderkind. He’d started as a reporter covering both sports and crime for theWashington Post before becoming the paper’s Moscow correspondent, which had ledto a celebrated book about Russia, and a Pulitzer Prize in his thirties. By thatsummer, he was in his late fifties, gray creeping into his black curls, andstill, there was a boyishness to him. When his wife later mentioned that he wastall, this was somehow news to me. He was the rare man of his stature, physicaland professional, who did not make you feel small. He sat, in jeans and ajacket, in one of the office chairs around the conference room table, bodylanguage relaxed but curious.He’d brought with him a young editor, Deirdre Foley-Mendelssohn, who’d joinedthe magazine earlier that year after stints at Harper’s and the Paris Review.Foley-Mendelssohn was thin and quiet and intense. The evening before, Remnickhad sat in her office and suggested she review Auletta’s old profile ofWeinstein. She’d done more than that, reading widely.As we sat together and I outlined the reporting, I could see Remnick thinkinghard. “And you think you can get more?” he said.“I know I can,” I replied, and told him about the leads NBC was stalling on.He asked if he could hear the tape, and, for the second time that summer, I satin front of leadership at a media outlet and put my phone on a table and hitPlay.Remnick and Foley-Mendelssohn listened. Their reaction was the polar opposite ofOppenheim’s. There was a stunned quiet afterward. “It’s not just the admission,”Foley-Mendelssohn said finally. “It’s the tone, the not taking no for ananswer.”“And NBC is letting you walk away with all this?” Remnick asked. “Who is thisperson at NBC? Oppenheim?”“Oppenheim,” I confirmed.“And he’s a screenwriter, you say?”“He wrote Jackie,” I replied.“That,” Remnick said gravely, “was a bad movie.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Ostrovskiy and a colleague had made a last, fruitless stop outside the New YorkTimes Building that morning. Then Khaykin called to relay fresh orders about me:“Track his cell phone.” Ostrovskiy thought back to Khaykin’s boast, the previousfall, that he was capable of doing that.Shortly after noon, Khaykin started sending screenshots of maps, marked withpin-drops indicating the latitude, longitude, and elevation of a moving target.Maybe Khaykin hadn’t been full of shit after all: the pinpointed locationssynced up exactly with my trip to the meeting with Remnick.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]I was frank with the New Yorker editors about every aspect of the reporting,including my hopes about its future at NBC. “I honestly don’t know what’shappening over there,” I said. “But I work there, and if there’s a chance thislast review is sincere, I have to give it a shot. I owe it to my producerthere.”Remnick made it clear that if NBC either killed the story again or didn’t intendto run its version first, he was interested. There would be more work to do, ofcourse. The more evidence I accumulated, the better. Weinstein and his legalteam, Remnick knew from experience, would be ready for a fight. But for thefirst time that summer, a news outlet was actively encouraging me. Remnick toldme to keep Foley-Mendelssohn apprised as the outstanding pieces of reporting,including the on-camera interview Canosa was contemplating, fell into place.“I’m not expecting you to promise anything yet, but I think there’s enough hereto publish something substantial,” I said.He nodded. “I think there may be.”After the meeting, Remnick went back into his office, and I said my goodbyes toFoley-Mendelssohn. “If they don’t let you continue for some reason,” she said,“call.”As I stepped out into the lobby, perhaps two hundred text messages flooded myphone. “(Survey) Should Trump be impeached?” they read, identically, one afteranother. “Reply to cast your vote. To unsubscribe from our list…” Each came froma different number. I stood, swiping away the texts, finally giving up andresponding to opt out, which seemed not to help.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]“It’s the area near World Trade Center,” Ostrovskiy wrote to Khaykin afterreceiving the maps. “Heading there now.” And then: “Any additional info where toexpect him to come out from?” and “Building at that address? Or he’s outsidepossibly?”“No data,” Khaykin replied.“Ok will look around.”Amid the flurry of survey texts, a message from McHugh came in, asking for anETA. I was due back at NBC. I moved toward the subway, then reconsidered. I’dfelt an odd anxiety since the day I’d wondered whether I was being followed. Imoved out onto the street instead and hailed a cab. As I made my way uptown, Iwent right by the private investigators.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Soon after, McHugh and I sat with the two producers Corvo had assigned to workon his review of the reporting. Both seemed earnestly interested, but it wasalso clear that the decisions about the fate of the story would be made abovetheir pay grade. The meeting was rushed: both producers were in and out ofscreenings of Dateline stories. McHugh and I gave them what reporting materialswe could print quickly, making it clear that there was more, including thesensitive material in the bank vault. They didn’t ask to listen to the tape. Asit turned out, they never would.When we stepped out of the meeting, McHugh had a missed call from a number hedidn’t recognize. It was Lanny Davis, the lawyer and public relations operative.“I understand you’re working with Ronan Farrow on a story about Harvey,” Davissaid. “Is that correct? Is that story still running? When do you plan to runit?”McHugh told him he couldn’t say anything about ongoing reporting. Davis said hewas on vacation and gave McHugh his cell phone number. “I’ve worked with theClintons for many years and now I’m working with Harvey,” Davis said. “And I’mhere to help.” McHugh hurried off the phone and for the rest of the afternoonseemed a little off balance.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]I’d booked a flight to Los Angeles that evening. I hoped I might finallypersuade Canosa to go on camera. Nestor, too, had agreed to meet, to map out apotential full-face interview.As I stepped into the departures terminal at JFK, Canosa called. She soundednervous. “He’s been calling me,” she said. Weinstein seemed to be keeping herclose, telling her how much he valued her loyalty.“If you feel like you can’t do this—”“No,” she said, firmly. Her face would be in shadow, but she would do it. “I’llgive the interview.” We set a time.The most recent rationale Oppenheim had offered for stopping thereporting—waiting for Corvo to assign a producer—had come and gone. McHugh and Ilet NBC know that we’d be proceeding with the interview.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]After our near-miss at the World Trade Center, the private investigators idledin the neighborhood. Khaykin chain-smoked, glancing at his phone, awaitingfurther GPS data that never came. That evening, Ostrovskiy staked out myapartment again, fruitlessly. “Don’t worry about the Ronan time at all,” hetexted his boss. “Seriously I understand the situation and did not expect to getpaid unless we actually found him.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter031]SYZYGY [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter031]Harvey Weinstein was also frustrated by a lack of updates. David Boies placedthe call to Andy Lack as he’d promised Weinstein he would. Boies asked Lackwhether work on the story was ongoing.Lack was reasonable and warm. He stayed quiet for most of the call, as he hadduring the earlier conversation with Weinstein, when the studio head hadsuggested that sleeping with employees was common practice. During his tenure asexecutive producer of West 57th in the late eighties, Lack, who was married atthe time, had pursued sexual relationships with underlings and talent. JaneWallace, one of the show’s correspondents, said that Lack was “almostunrelenting.” When she started work at the show, she said, Lack asked her to goto dinner with him “every day for almost a month,” saying he wanted to celebrateher contract. “If your boss does that, what are you gonna say?” she later toldme. “You know if you say ‘I don’t want to celebrate with you,’ you’re asking fortrouble.” Wallace said that it was “ultimately consensual, but I didn’t just getflirted with. I got worked over.” The relationship eventually soured. Lack, shesaid, became volatile. As she left the show, she recalled him yelling, “You willnever get credit.” Then the network deployed a tactic that the public was barelyconscious of at the time: it offered her a substantial payout to sign a bindingnondisclosure agreement. Wallace accepted. “It wasn’t till I really got out ofthere that I felt the full force of it. Of how disgusted I was,” she told me.“The truth is, if he hadn’t been like that, I would have kept that job. I lovedthat job.”Several other former employees of Lack’s recalled another relationship with ayoung associate producer who worked for him named Jennifer Laird. When therelationship ended, colleagues recalled Lack turning hostile, taking what theysaw as punitive actions. When Laird asked to be reassigned, Lack wouldn’t allowit. He compelled her to work longer hours, and on weekends, and proposed shecancel vacations. Through a spokesperson, Lack denied taking any retaliatoryactions against Laird. Laird confirmed that the relationship had happened, andsaid the aftermath was “extremely uncomfortable.” She told me, “There’s clearlya reason you don’t get involved with your boss.”Lack’s reputation had preceded him in his latest role at NBC. “Why would you dothat?” one executive recalled asking Steve Burke upon learning of his decisionto reinstate Lack. “The reason you have those cultural problems down there—hecreated that!”That day on the phone with Boies, Lack was less quiet when the conversationturned to the story’s fate at NBC. “We’ve told Harvey we’re not doing a story,”Lack said. “If we decide to do a story, we’ll tell him.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]As I flew to Los Angeles the evening after the meeting at The New Yorker,Greenberg called McHugh, sounding frantic. He said Oppenheim had told him to“hit the pause button on this.”“Meaning I can’t report anything else?” McHugh said.“That’s coming from our boss,” Greenberg replied. “That’s an order.”Then, the following morning, Greenberg called me and said the same thing.“Noah’s directive is very clear-cut,” he told me. “We can’t shoot thisinterview. We are pausing.”I was at Jonathan’s place in West Hollywood. He walked over, agape. “To beclear, you’re ordering me to cancel this interview,” I told Greenberg.There was a long silence. “It’s a pause,” he said.“The interview is scheduled. You’re asking me to un-schedule it. How is that apause?”“Ronan,” he said, in a huff now. “You have to stop.”“Do we know how long this pause is?” I asked. “Why exactly is NBC News orderingus to stop reporting?”He sounded at sea.“I—he—Harvey’s lawyers have made the argument that every employee is subject toa nondisclosure agreement,” he said. “And we can’t just go encouraging them tobreach those.”“Rich, that’s just not how legal exposure works. Conducting the interviewdoesn’t—”“This is Noah’s decision,” he said. “I understand if you don’t like it, but Idon’t think any of us is in a position to disagree with it.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]I paced the length of the apartment, debating the situation with Jonathan.Oppenheim’s suggestion that I bring the story to another outlet felt precarious.“He knows this is a scandal when it runs somewhere else, doesn’t he?” Jonathanpointed out. I wanted to keep fighting the ban on reporting. But if I did so,the dynamic might turn openly acrimonious, and the network might try to block mefrom taking the material out the door.Jonathan proposed what I did next. I called Oppenheim and said I’d like to takehim up on the offer to “go with God” to a print outlet, but presented it assomething nonthreatening and friendly. I told him, truthfully, that I hadpreliminary interest from a print editor. I didn’t say which one. I suggestedthat NBC could continue to shoot my interviews and run a television versionafter I broke the story in print.“I don’t want to sort of stand in the way of you proceeding with something. Myinstinct is it sounds like a reasonable proposal,” Oppenheim said. He soundedovercome with relief. “Let me take ten minutes and take a breath, and I’ll comeback to you.”As promised, ten minutes later, he texted saying that sounded fine. I asked if Icould still have an NBC crew in the next interview, with Canosa. I pointed outthat it wouldn’t obligate him to air it, it would just preserve the option.“Unfortunately,” he replied, “We can’t move forward with anything for NBC untilthe review is complete.”Within twenty-four hours, Oppenheim would meet with Corvo and the producersworking under him and halt the review. One of the producers told the group thatNestor was “not ready to be outed.” Nestor, who had already told me she’d go onthe record if I needed it, denied saying anything of the kind. Corvo, at onepoint, argued that the reporting was insufficiently visual and wouldn’t make forgood television.Greenberg then gave McHugh a final order to stop taking calls about the story.“You are to stand down,” he said. McHugh thought of all the times Weinstein hadsuccessfully quashed the story in the past, and replied, “We are letting himwin.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]With no news organization behind the story, I had no one to consult aboutsecurity, and no protection if Weinstein decided to sue me personally. I calledFoley-Mendelssohn. “He’s obviously already threatened NBC,” I said, “I know thestory’s the important thing, but I’m trying to figure out how exposed I amhere.”“Send me everything you have,” she said. “We can start a conversation aboutthis.”“But your gut is I keep these interviews going, without a news outlet behindme?”She considered this.“I don’t know the specific legal risks here. But I don’t think you should cancelthings. You never stop reporting.”Foley-Mendelssohn offered to introduce me to The New Yorker’s lawyer, FabioBertoni. Rendering legal advice, even informal legal advice, to someone themagazine hadn’t taken on as a writer was outside of standard operatingprocedure. But Foley-Mendelssohn sensed how far out on a limb I was.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]As I waited for word from Remnick, I sent Foley-Mendelssohn too many nervoustexts, letting her know I was proceeding with reporting calls, reading the tealeaves of her responses for any trace of further commitment.I did, as promised, hear from Fabio Bertoni. He had previously worked atAmerican Lawyer magazine and HarperCollins, fending off precisely the kind ofthreats to publication that I was confronting. When I explained NBC’s insistenceon halting reporting, supposedly due to concerns about legal exposure, he seemedgenuinely at a loss. “The exposure happens when you run the story,” he said. “Itwould be extremely unusual to see any legal action over unpublished reporting.”When I told him the argument had been tortious interference, he was even moreconfused. He made the same point I’d tried to make in my own conversations withthe network: a significant portion of all political and business reporting wouldbe impossible if news organizations looked askance at talking to employees withnondisclosure agreements. My early experiences at The New Yorker felt like thosevideos where lab animals walk on grass for the first time.“So do I keep going, even knowing he’s actively threatening?” I asked.“Here’s the thing,” Bertoni said. “It’s easy for people to make scary legalthreats. It’s another thing entirely to act on them.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]I’d promised Canosa I’d put her on camera, and I didn’t want to spook her bychanging that plan. And so I set about trying to hire a crew myself.McHugh—ordered not to help with the shoot but still bent on doing so, because hewas just that kind of guy—sent me name after name. The Monday in late Augustchosen for the interview coincided with a rare total eclipse of the sun. Most ofthe freelance crews we contacted were busy shooting the eclipse from idealvantage points in places like Wyoming. For the few still in town, there was afurther wrinkle: almost everyone had worked on Weinstein productions or stood toin the future. I finally found a shooter named Ulli Bonnekamp. Either because heknew I was doing it alone or because he could sense it was a subject matterworth caring about, he gave me a reasonable rate.I asked Canosa if she’d be more comfortable shooting in a hotel room, and shesaid being back at Jonathan’s place, where she’d bonded with the dog, suited herfine. As the syzygy commenced, the crew and I got to work retrofitting the housein West Hollywood. We carted around sandbags and tripods, and taped blackoutcloth over the windows, and generally did not treat Jonathan’s furniture withgreat compassion.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Midafternoon, a text came in from Oppenheim. “Just to reiterate in writing, anyfurther reporting you’re doing, including today’s interview, is not on behalf ofor with the blessing of NBC. That needs to be clear not only to you, but anyoneyou make speak with.”“You know my view,” I wrote back. “But I understand and am honoring this.”When Canosa arrived, I was honest with her about the uncertainty of the story’sfuture. I told her the interview still had value. That I’d go to the mat to makeit public somewhere. She didn’t balk, and that evening, we started rolling. Theinterview was devastating. “He creates the situation in which your silence willbenefit you more than speaking out will,” Canosa said of Weinstein.“And for any news outlet grappling with the decision of whether this is animportant story, whether your allegation is serious enough, credible enough,” Iasked, “what would you say to them?”“If you don’t run with this, if you don’t move forward with this and expose him,you’re on the wrong side of history,” she said. “He’s going to be exposed. Itbenefits you to do it and not wait till he is and everyone knows you weresitting on information that could have prevented other women going through it,for potentially years to come.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 32: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter032]HURRICANE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter032]All through those last weeks of August, what would eventually become a Category4 hurricane bore down on the Gulf of Mexico. As Emily Nestor and I sat down at acoffee shop in Brentwood, scenes of devastation flickered on a television in thecorner. Since Nestor had told me she was open to showing her face if NBC wantedit, she hadn’t evinced any signs of backing down. But I also hadn’t told herthat the story’s institutional support had dissipated, and that going on therecord now meant a print fact-checking process.“I’m asking you if you’ll still put your name on this,” I said. I told her thatI was going to send my draft to The New Yorker, and that the magazine woulddecide whether to take on the story based on it. I told her every name stillcounted.“I’ve had a lot of time to think about this,” she said. I studied the worriedface of this stranger I’d asked to upend her life, then jerked around formonths. She was quiet for a moment, then said, “I’m going to do it.”I raced out of the coffee shop to put the finishing touches on the draft. Hereis how it described the reporting The New Yorker would be considering, that NBCNews had sent away:In the course of a nine month investigation, five women alleged to me directlythat Harvey Weinstein committed multiple acts of sexual harassment and abuse.The allegations range from inappropriate sexual propositions directed atemployees, to groping and touching of the kind confessed to in the NYPD tape, totwo claims of rape. The allegations span nearly twenty years. Many of the womenworked for Weinstein, and all of their claims involved ostensibly professionalmeetings, which they claim Weinstein used to lure them to hotels where theyexperienced unwanted sexual advances. In at least three cases, Weinstein usedlarge financial settlements with strict nondisclosure agreements to preventcriminal proceedings and public revelation.Sixteen former and current executives and assistants at Weinstein’s companiescorroborated those allegations, saying they witnessed unwanted sexual advances,inappropriate touching, and a pattern that included Weinstein using companyresources to set up sexual liaisons of the type described in the allegations.I sent the draft to Foley-Mendelssohn. On a muted TV in Jonathan’s living room,Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Back at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, the calls kept coming in from Weinstein and hisintermediaries. One afternoon, Lanny Davis received a request from Weinsteinmuch like the ones Boies was fielding. Davis was in a meeting betweenWeinstein’s team and the New York Times focused on the allegations thatWeinstein had misused funds raised for amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research.Afterward, Weinstein told Davis, “I just talked to someone at NBC. Would you goover there and find out the status of the story?”“Harvey,” Davis replied, “I told you I’m not involved in this women’s issue.”“All I’m asking is for you to go over and meet someone in the lobby and askwhat’s the status on the story,” Weinstein said.“If I’m gonna do this, I want someone else with me,” Davis replied.At this, Weinstein sounded nervous. “Why do you want that?” he asked.“Because I’m not supposed to be doing this issue, and I want someone to beavailable to confirm exactly the words I used.”Weinstein, a little huffy, said that was fine, and Davis, joined by a WeinsteinCompany employee, headed to 30 Rock. At the marble visitors’ desk, Davis said hewas there for Noah Oppenheim.“Mr. Oppenheim knows I’m coming,” he told the assistant working the desk. Later,NBC would say that Davis ambushed Oppenheim. Of that claim, Davis told me, “Thisis a rare exception to my usual reluctance to use the word ‘lie.’ I’m absolutelycertain someone knew that was a deliberate misrepresentation.”What is not in dispute is that, a few minutes later, Oppenheim came down. TheWeinstein Company employee Davis had brought with him watched from a shortdistance away.“What is the status of the Ronan Farrow story on Harvey?” Davis asked.Oppenheim answered quickly. “Oh, he’s no longer working on the story,” he said.“He’s not working for us.” The way he said it made Davis wonder if I’d beenfired altogether.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]It was September 5 and still hot when I headed back to The New Yorker. In theelevator up, I did a little sign of the cross, almost involuntarily. Remnick andFoley-Mendelssohn, along with Bertoni, the lawyer, Dorothy Wickenden, anexecutive editor, and Natalie Raabe, the magazine’s head of communications, satopposite me at the table in Remnick’s conference room. I had no idea whatRemnick would say.“I think everyone’s aware of the story,” he said. “But why don’t you update us.”I ran through much the same summary from the top of the draft, culminating inhow the interview with Canosa had fallen into place. I mentioned the ongoingpressure on sources, the calls they were getting.“Are these sources willing to stand by what they’ve told you in court?” Bertoniasked. “Can you see if they’ll do that?”I told Bertoni that I’d already put the question to several major sources, andthat they’d said yes.The rhythm of the conversation picked up: Remnick and Bertoni took turns askingquestions about specific pieces of reporting and the evidence that backed themup. Did I have the messages from Reiter, the executive who acknowledged toNestor the pattern of misconduct? I did. Was Gutierrez willing to show us hercontract? She was. Foley-Mendelssohn, by then intimately familiar with thestory, chimed in periodically, reminding them of the existence of a secondarysource here, a document there.Later, several people in that room would reach for the same adjectives todescribe me: sad, desperate, trying to preempt pushback at every turn. It was,one said, like I was defending a dissertation.I thought of the meeting weeks before, when Oppenheim had first killed thestory. I studied the faces across from me, trying to decide how to convey thestakes. Wickenden, a veteran of decades in the magazine business, said gently,“You’ve been working on this a long time, haven’t you?”I thought, again, of Sciorra’s voice; of Gutierrez, flinching as the recordingof Weinstein played; of Nestor, making her decision. “I know there’s a chance oflitigation here,” I said. “I know bringing the story here would mean morereviewing, more fact-checking. I just think there’s enough here that it deservesthat chance.”A silence across the room, a few glances exchanged.“Alright,” said Remnick, without drama, in a scene from a different movie.“You’ll work with Deirdre. No guarantees until this is fact-checked.”Remnick was thoughtful, restrained. He had published Seymour Hersh’s contentiousnational security reporting on Afghanistan and Pakistan, and Lawrence Wright’sinvestigation into the Church of Scientology. But this would be a new andspecific kind of challenge. “We do this straight down the middle,” he said.“Just the facts.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Not long after, at the Loews Regency hotel on Park Avenue, Harvey Weinstein metwith an actress, then retired to a corner with a familiar companion: DylanHoward, of the National Enquirer. By then, Howard and Weinstein were spendingmore time together. Often, Howard told colleagues trying to reach him, “I’m withHarvey.” Howard produced several thick manila folders. He and Weinstein spentthe following hours scrutinizing their contents, heads bowed in hushedconversation. At one point, one of Weinstein’s assistants walked over to the twomen’s table to inform Weinstein that he had an incoming call. Weinsteinscrambled to cover up the documents. “What the fuck are you doing back here?!”he shouted. Howard offered a sympathetic glance. Later he whispered to theassistant, “Not jealous of your job!”Howard’s focus on Weinstein’s opponents had continued. So had his interest inMatt Lauer, a figure the Enquirer had long circled. Since Howard had examinedthe “kill file” of unpublished reporting about Lauer, the Enquirer had run threenegative stories about the Today show anchor. A fourth would arrive shortlyafter the meeting with Weinstein at the Loews Regency. The stories werepreoccupied with Lauer’s infidelity, particularly at work. “NBC Gives SleazyLauer One More Chance,” read one headline. “Hey Matt, That’s Not Your Wife!”read another."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 33: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter033]GOOSE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter033]By then, Weinstein was acting frantically, deploying his usual mix ofintimidation and influence in the media. Howard’s boss, David Pecker of AmericanMedia Inc., had long been a close ally, but started appearing more frequently inWeinstein’s emails. “Dear David, I just tried you,” Weinstein wrote late thatSeptember. “Are you available for a call now?” Pecker responded, “I am in SaudiArabia on business.” Later, Weinstein proposed an alliance to purchase RollingStone magazine for Pecker to add to his media empire and run behind the scenes.Pecker at first demurred, then acceded. “I can reduce costs and bring theprofits to $10mm…. If you want it you can own 52% for $45mm. I would be happy todo all the back office for you and be responsible for the magazine print anddigital operations.”Weinstein amplified his outreach to NBC, too. There were emails and calls toDeborah Turness, Oppenheim’s predecessor, who was now in charge of internationalcontent. Weinstein proposed cutting a deal with Turness around a documentary hewas making about Clinton. “Your Hillary doc series sounds absolutely stunning,”Turness wrote. “I am here and would commit to turning our platforms intodedicated ‘Hillary channels’ for several nights!”Late that month, Weinstein sent an email to Ron Meyer, the veteran head ofUniversal Studios and still, at the time, vice chairman of NBCUniversal. “DearRon,” he wrote. “I wanted to talk to you about Universal doing our home videoand VOD—we’re talking to your guys and I think it’s always good to have a wordfrom the top.” Meyer replied, “I would love to make this work.” Emails from theWeinstein Company’s COO, David Glasser, show the proposed deal coalescing. Aterm sheet was drafted, then submitted to the company’s senior management forapproval. Glasser’s team began discussing the finer points with two homeentertainment executives at NBCUniversal. “I look forward to us being inbusiness together,” Meyer wrote soon after. “As I told you, if there is anythingbut a yes please let me know.” The deal never went ahead.Weinstein had seemed relieved after Lanny Davis’s report back on the meetingwith Oppenheim and Boies’s update after the call with Lack. Weinstein had takenboth as unambiguous confirmation that the story was dropped, and possibly mewith it. But he wanted more. He ordered another round of calls from his legalteam to NBC’s. It wasn’t long before Susan Weiner was on the phone with one ofDavis’s attorneys, using similar language: I was, she said, no longer workingfor NBC News.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]I knew nothing of this. I still had time left in my contract with NBC News and,as far as I knew, was still planning to renew it. The killing of the story hadshaken me, but I still felt loyal to the network, and to my bosses there.Greenberg sounded enthused about expanding my investigative work over theupcoming years. Don Nash, the Today executive producer, proposed an expandedrole for me as the show’s main investigative correspondent.On September 11, after McHugh and I returned from one of our ongoing shoots, fora story about health care, I sat down with Oppenheim again. There was a beat ofsmall talk about his Hollywood projects, including a long-gestating script aboutHarry Houdini. He was mulling possible lead actors. I suggested MichaelFassbender. Oppenheim said, like a screenwriter’s caricature of a Hollywoodagent, that the actor couldn’t open a movie. I murmured something aboutAssassin’s Creed, and finally, it seemed, we’d agreed on something we foundobjectionable in Hollywood.I told Oppenheim about my hopes for the future. He looked at me sympathetically,told me he’d looked into it. “There’s just no room in the budget for youanymore.”“Oh,” I said.He told me that maybe the network could have me back for one-off stories hereand there. “We can’t commit to anything regular,” he said. “Sorry. I tried.”After the meeting, I called Jonathan and told him, “So I’m about to beunemployed. Guess it’s not going to happen. You a media mogul, me on the show…”“You’re not a morning person anyway,” he said.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Back in Los Angeles, at Jonathan’s place, I got a call from a UK number I didn’trecognize. The caller identified himself as Seth Freedman, a frequent writer forthe Guardian. He said he was working “on a kind of collaborative piece withjournalists from other papers on a very kind of soft piece about life in thefilm industry.” The description was off, strangely vague. “We’ve come acrosssome stuff doing our research that we really can’t use,” Freedman continued. “Ijust wondered if what we have could be useful to you, basically.”He asked about McGowan, saying she’d “been very helpful for the piece we’redoing.” Then he offered to connect me with another high-profile source if Icould tell him more about my work.“Someone I spoke to said, ‘Mr. Farrow might be working on something related.’”“And who was it that suggested that this might be a topic of interest for me?”“If you don’t mind, I’d rather not say, not in a kind of hostile way, just thatthe person who’d said ‘Mr. Farrow might be working on it’ doesn’t want to beinvolved himself.”I told Freedman I was open to leads, but couldn’t tell him anything. He wassilent for a beat, unsatisfied. “If someone makes an allegation against someone,libel law in the UK is very strict and no one will publish if you say, ‘Ms. Xsaid this about Mr. Y.’ Unless you’ve got some kind of proof to back it up. Isit different in the States, can you publish ‘This person said that about someoneelse,’ or would you also have to stand it up in some way?” It sounded like awarning. “Without knowing more about the details of your story, I reallycouldn’t advise,” I told him, and politely ended the call. It was one of severalsimilar calls Freedman made that month, based on instructions he received viaemail and WhatsApp, from a project manager at Black Cube.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]About two weeks after my meeting with Oppenheim, Susan Weiner called. “Thereason I’m calling is we have continued to have concerns raised to us about thereporting regarding Mr. Weinstein,” she said. “We thought we had made it clearto you that NBC is not involved in this story in any way.”I told Weiner that, while Oppenheim had made it clear that he couldn’t go first,we were still looking at the possibility of resurrecting the TV version afterthe story broke in print. Greenberg had told McHugh several times that thisprospect wasn’t completely dead.“I can’t speak for Rich and Noah, but my understanding is that NBC has nointerest in ever being a part of this story,” she said. “NBC does not want to bementioned in connection with this at all. And we are being advised that you havebeen identifying yourself as an NBC reporter.”Harvey Weinstein had by then acquired an expansive collection of my introductoryemails to sources. Weiner began reading one of these aloud. “I see here you sayyou’ve reported for NBC News,” she said.“Well, that’s accurate, of course,” I replied. I’d been transparent withsources. Since the story had been picked up by a print publication, I’d saidnothing to suggest NBC had any ongoing involvement. But I’d mentioned my widerwork with the network as a credential. And even after the conversation withOppenheim about the budget, I hoped to continue that work, in the context ofwhatever small, piece-by-piece deal he could offer.“My understanding is your contract is now terminated,” Weiner said. “If you inany way imply that NBC had any involvement in this story, we will be forced topublicly disclose that.”“Susan, we’ve worked together for years,” I said. “You can reassure Noah that Iwon’t say NBC’s working on this, but there’s no need to—”“Obviously we don’t want to publicly discuss your contract status, but we willbe forced to do so if we receive any more complaints about this. Noah wants tomake sure the word ‘NBC’ does not appear in any communications about thisstory.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]In conversations with people around him, Weinstein was ecstatic. “He keptsaying, ‘If I can get a network to kill a story, how hard can a newspaper be?’”recalled one of them. Weinstein seemed to be referring to his trouble at theTimes. “He was triumphant,” added a senior Weinstein Company executive. “It wasthe kind of thing he’d be yelling at us. He’d say, ‘I got them to kill thisfucking story, I’m the only one getting anything done here.’”At around close of business the day before Weiner’s call to me, Weinstein hadsent Oppenheim a warm note, burying the hatchet:From: ““Office, HW”” <HWX X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X XDate: Monday, September 25, 2017 at 4:53 PMTo: NBCUniversal <noahX X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X XSubject: From Harvey WeinsteinDear Noah,I know we’ve been on opposite sides of the fence, but my team and I watchedMegyn Kelly today and thought she was terrific—congratulations, I’m going tosend you a little gift to celebrate. The format is outstanding as well. Ifthere’s anything we can do to help, we have a pretty significant film andtelevision lineup coming up. The WILL & GRACE part was warm andhilarious—really, the whole format was just smart, smart, smart.All my best,HarveyTo this, Oppenheim replied: “Thanks Harvey, appreciate the well-wishes!”Shortly thereafter, Weinstein’s staff received a message in the usual formatkeeping them apprised of mailed gifts: “UPDATE,” it read. “Noah Oppenheimreceived a bottle of Grey Goose.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 34: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter034]LETTER [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter034]All that September, my representatives at CAA had been calling. First AlanBerger, my agent, and Bryan Lourd, his boss and one of the heads of the agency,called to say Weinstein had been hounding them. I told them both that if therewas a story about Weinstein moving ahead, I would meet with him, as early as wasappropriate. When Lourd passed on the message, Weinstein wouldn’t take no for ananswer. As Lourd told the story, Weinstein showed up at the agent’s office inLos Angeles and ranted for more than an hour.“He said he’s far from perfect and has been working on himself for a very longtime now, and felt like he was being painted with an old brush, so to speak,”Lourd said. “Honestly, I kept thinking, I did not volunteer for this. Why isthis happening right now.” Weinstein said he’d hired a lot of lawyers. That hedidn’t want to create problems for me. That a meeting had to happenstraightaway.The next Tuesday, the same day I spoke with Weiner, there was another email fromWeinstein to Lourd demanding to talk immediately, and an update from Lourd inresponse.This guy won’t meet right nowHe did say he will call you soonI think he is absolutely pursuing the storyBThat Friday, Weinstein kept calling Berger and Lourd. Weinstein told Berger hislegal team was at the ready. He specifically mentioned Harder, and Boies, and—Ifelt a jolt when Berger repeated the name to me—Lisa Bloom.A few hours later, copies of a letter started arriving at various offices atCAA. I thought of the scene from Harry Potter where invitations to attendHogwarts start flying in through the fireplace and the letterbox and thewindows. Berger called to read me the letter. It was not an invitation to attendHogwarts. It was Charles Harder conveying Harvey Weinstein’s threat to sue me,based on an arrangement he suggested had been reached with NBC News:Dear Mr. Farrow:This law firm is litigation counsel for The Weinstein Company.We understand that you have interviewed certain people affiliated with TheWeinstein Company and/or its employees and executives (collectively, “TWC”), andhave been reaching out to other persons affiliated with TWC, seeking additionalinterviews, based on the representation to each such person that you are workingon a story for NBCUniversal News Group (“NBC”). NBC has informed us, in writing,that it is no longer working on any story about or relating to TWC (includingits employees and executives), and all such activities have been terminated.Accordingly:1. All interviews that you have conducted or been involved in relating to TWC(including its employees and executives) are the property of NBC and do notbelong to you, nor are you licensed by NBC to use any such interviews.2. Demand is hereby made that you turn over all of your work product relating toTWC (including its employees and executives) to Susan Weiner, Esq., ExecutiveVice President, Deputy General Counsel, NBC Universal, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, NewYork, NY 10112.3. Should NBC license any content to you for any purpose, TWC will hold NBCjointly and severally liable for your unlawful acts, including defamation.4. All interviews that you have conducted or been involved in relating to TWC(including its employees and executives) are now invalid, because they werebased on the representation that the interview was for story by NBC. NBC hasterminated its involvement. Therefore, you have no right to use any suchinterview for any purpose, and should you do so, you would be engaged inmisrepresentation, deception and/or fraud.5. If you are now working with any other news outlet regarding yourinvestigation and story about TWC (including its employees and executives),please provide me with the name and contact information of that news outlet andthe person(s) at that company to whom you report, so that we can place thatcompany on notice of my client’s legal claims against them.6. If you have any intention of publishing or disseminating any story orstatements about TWC (including its employees and executives), now or in thefuture, we demand that you provide my client, in care of this office, a list ofevery single statement that you intend to publish or disseminate about TWC(including its employees and executives), including all statements by you and byany third parties, so that my client can place you on specific notice of anyfalse and defamatory statements, and demand that you cease and desist frompublishing or disseminating any such statements or face a lawsuit for millionsof dollars in damages, and that you give my client at least fifteen (15) days toprovide you with a response before any story or statements are published ordisseminated.7. Cease and desist from any and all further communications with TWC’s currentand former employees and contractors. All such persons have signedconfidentiality agreements, and your past communications, and any futurecommunications, with them constitutes an intentional interference withcontractual relations.Pages of demands that I preserve documents in anticipation of potentiallitigation followed. NBC later denied ever reaching an agreement with Weinsteinand said Harder was misrepresenting their communications.I forwarded the letter to Bertoni. “I don’t want to disregard it, but it strikesme as silly right now,” he said. He thought a copyright claim from NBC on theunderlying contents of the interviews was dubious, and that, in any case, hecouldn’t imagine the network actually following through on the threat. Still,the line about written assurances that reporting had been terminated “was justshocking to me,” he recalled later.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The last time I answered a call from Lisa Bloom that summer, I expressedastonishment.“Lisa, you swore, as an attorney and a friend, that you wouldn’t tell hispeople,” I said.“Ronan,” she replied. “I am his people.”I thought of her calls and texts and voicemails pressing me for information,dangling clients, enticing me to meet about Blac Chyna. Bloom reminded me thatshe’d mentioned she knew Weinstein and Boies. But that was after she made thepromise not to disclose anything I told her. And she hadn’t let on that she wasactually representing Weinstein in the matter she kept asking about.Bloom told me Weinstein had optioned her book, that she’d been in an awkwardposition. “Ronan, you need to come in. I can help. I can talk to David andHarvey. I can make this easier for you.”“Lisa, this is not appropriate,” I said.“I don’t know what women you’re talking to,” she said. “But I can give youinformation about them. If it’s Rose McGowan, we have files on her. I lookedinto her myself when this first came up. She’s crazy.”Collecting myself, I told her, “I welcome any information you think might berelevant for any story I might be working on.” Then I got off the phone. Bloomnever got around to sending the supposed dirt on McGowan."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 35: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter035]MIMIC [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter035]I didn’t accede to Harder’s threat—didn’t even, on Bertoni’s advice, respond toit. I just kept reporting. That month, I finally got Mira Sorvino on the phone.Sorvino, the daughter of actor Paul Sorvino, had come to prominence in thenineties. She’d won an Oscar, in 1995, for Mighty Aphrodite—one of Woody Allen’sfilms Weinstein had distributed and had emphasized in his threats to NBC. Andshe’d been a bona fide movie star for the following year or two, culminating ina leading role in another Weinstein film, Mimic. After that she more or lessdisappeared.In our first call, Sorvino sounded petrified. “I already lost so much of mycareer to this,” she told me. “This” was a pattern of sexual harassment fromWeinstein while they were working together. At the Toronto International FilmFestival in September 1995 to promote Mighty Aphrodite, she found herself in ahotel room with Weinstein. “He started massaging my shoulders, which made mevery uncomfortable, and then tried to get more physical, sort of chasing mearound,” she said. He was trying to kiss her when she scrambled away,improvising ways to ward him off, telling him that it was against her religionto date married men. Then she left the room.A few weeks later, in New York City, her phone rang after midnight. It wasWeinstein, saying that he had new marketing ideas for Mighty Aphrodite andasking to get together. Sorvino offered to meet him at an all-night diner, buthe said he was coming over to her apartment and hung up. “I freaked out,” shetold me. She called a friend and asked him to come over and pose as herboyfriend. The friend hadn’t arrived by the time Weinstein rang her doorbell.“Harvey had managed to bypass my doorman,” she said. “I opened the doorterrified, brandishing my twenty-pound Chihuahua mix in front of me, as thoughthat would do any good.” When she told Weinstein that her new boyfriend was onhis way, he seemed dejected and left.Sorvino said that she felt afraid and intimidated; when she told a femaleemployee at Miramax about the harassment, the woman’s reaction “was shock andhorror that I had mentioned it.” Sorvino recalled “the look on her face, like Iwas suddenly radioactive.”Sorvino was convinced that, after she rejected Weinstein, he’d retaliatedagainst her, blacklisted her, hurt her career. But she acknowledged thedifficulty of ever proving this point. Sorvino appeared in a few more ofWeinstein’s films after Mighty Aphrodite. On Mimic, when Weinstein and hisbrother, Bob, had fired the film’s director, Guillermo del Toro, and recut thefilm against his wishes, she’d objected and fought on del Toro’s behalf. “Ican’t say definitively whether it was the Mimic fight or it was his advances,”she told me, “but it is my strong feeling I was retaliated against for refusingand then reporting this harassment.” Later, her suspicions would be borne out:the director Peter Jackson said that, when he was considering casting Sorvinoand Ashley Judd in The Lord of the Rings, Weinstein had interceded. “I recallMiramax telling us they were a nightmare to work with and we should avoid themat all costs,” Jackson later told a reporter. “At the time, we had no reason toquestion what these guys were telling us. But in hindsight, I realize that thiswas very likely the Miramax smear campaign in full swing.”Sorvino told me that she’d struggled for years with whether to come forward withher story and argued—to me but also, it seemed, to herself—that her experiencewas mild enough that maybe she didn’t have to. But Sorvino’s claim, like theothers that involved unwanted advances but not assault, were pivotal inestablishing Weinstein’s M.O.Sorvino was formidable. She’d graduated magna cum laude from Harvard. And she’dadvocated for charitable causes related to the abuse of women, including as a UNGoodwill Ambassador to Combat Human Trafficking. It was evident, from our firstconversations, that she was undertaking a careful analysis, and that her senseof wider ethical obligations weighed heavily in it.“When you first wrote,” she said, “I had a nightmare, that you showed up with avideo camera and asked about working with Woody.” She was sorry for my sister,she said. I told her—awkwardly, talking too fast, changing the subject—that halfmy friends in the industry had worked with Allen, that it didn’t take away fromher performance, that it was my sister’s issue, not mine, that she shouldn’tworry about it. But I could sense her worrying, and reflecting, just the same.Sorvino decided she’d help and, over the course of several calls, went fully onthe record. But the fear in her voice never left. “When people go up againstpower brokers there is punishment,” she said. I realized her anxieties wentbeyond career considerations. She asked if I had security, if I’d thought aboutthe risk of disappearing, of an “accident” befalling me. I said I was fine, thatI was taking precautions, then wondered what precautions I was actually taking,other than glancing over my shoulder a lot. “You should be careful,” she said.“I’m afraid he has connections beyond just professional ones. Nefariousconnections that could hurt people.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The voices kept tumbling in. After Rosanna Arquette’s representatives went dark,I found her sister, who promised to pass on the request. A few days later,Arquette and I were on the phone. “I knew this day would come,” she said. “Theanxiety that’s in my chest right now—it’s off the charts.” She sat down, triedto collect herself. “I just have this ‘danger, danger’ alarm going on,” she toldme.Arquette told me that, in the early nineties, she’d agreed to meet Weinstein fordinner at the Beverly Hills Hotel to pick up the script for a new film. At thehotel, she was instructed to meet him upstairs, in his room. Arquette recalledthat, when she arrived at the room, Weinstein opened the door wearing a whitebathrobe. He said that his neck was sore and that he needed a massage. She toldhim that she could recommend a good masseuse. “Then he grabbed my hand,” shesaid. “He put it on his neck.” When she yanked her hand away, Weinstein grabbedit again and pulled it toward his penis, which was visible and erect. “My heartwas really racing. I was in a fight-or-flight moment,” she said. She toldWeinstein, “I will never do that.”Weinstein told her that she was making a huge mistake by rejecting him, andnamed an actress and a model who he claimed had given in to his sexual overturesand whose careers he said he had advanced as a result. Arquette said sheresponded, “I’ll never be that girl,” and left. Arquette’s story was importantbecause of how closely it hewed to others I’d heard: professional pretext,meeting moved upstairs, hotel room, request for massage, bathrobe.Arquette shared Sorvino’s conviction that her career had suffered because sherejected Weinstein. “He made things very difficult for me for years,” she said.Her small role in Pulp Fiction did come afterward. But Arquette felt she onlygot the part because of its size and Weinstein’s deference to the director,Quentin Tarantino. This, too, was a leitmotif: Sorvino had suspected that herromantic relationship with Tarantino at the time had shielded her fromretaliation, and that this protection had dissipated when the two split up.Later, Tarantino would say publicly that he could have, should have, done more.Arquette, like Sorvino, had a history of advocating for vulnerable and exploitedpeople. The bigger picture was inescapable for her. She spoke of a cabal thatwas wider and deeper than Weinstein. “This is the big boys’ club, the Hollywoodmafia,” she said. “They protect each other.” Over the course of severalconversations, she agreed to be a part of the story.When I told her Weinstein was already aware of my reporting, Arquette said,“He’s gonna be working very hard to track people down and silence people. Tohurt people. That’s what he does.” She didn’t think the story would ever break.“They’re gonna discredit every woman who comes forward,” she said. “They’ll goafter the girls. And suddenly the victims will be perpetrators.”By then, Black Cube had already circulated another profile. It assessedArquette’s likelihood to talk, mentioning her friendship with McGowan, hersocial media posts about sexual misconduct, and even a family member who hadexperienced abuse.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The day of my first conversation with Arquette, Lacy Lynch, the literary agentworking with McGowan, sent an email to Harvey Weinstein, suggesting they meetup. A week later, Weinstein, Lynch, and Jan Miller, the founder of the agencywhere Lynch worked, sat together at the Lambs Club, a restaurant in midtownManhattan decorated with pictures of old Broadway and Hollywood. Lynch andMiller pitched Weinstein on various literary properties they’d acquired. “I justhad dinner with Lacy Lynch and Jan,” Weinstein wrote afterward to Glasser, hiscompany’s COO. Weinstein described his favorite pitch, a story drawn from a bookLynch had sold about police brutality. “I think this could be great for Jay Z,”Weinstein wrote.That summer, Lynch had been drawing closer to Weinstein. She feared his abilityto retaliate against her clients with ties to him. Later, she would say publiclythat she knew he was interested in her because of her connection to McGowan, andthat she was just playing along. If that was the case, he never caught on. Atthe Lambs Club, Weinstein, Lynch, and Miller talked shop. Then Weinstein offeredthe women tickets to see a performance of Dear Evan Hansen on Broadway.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]In the months since Lynch had introduced them, McGowan and Diana Filip hadcontinued to spend time together. Sometimes they met at hotel bars in LA and NewYork. Other times they took long walks. Once, McGowan brought Filip to theVenice boardwalk. They ate ice cream as they strolled. The potential speakingengagement had been just the beginning. By that fall, Filip was talkingseriously about investing in McGowan’s production company.That September, in Los Angeles, the two met with one of Filip’s colleagues fromReuben Capital Partners. He, like Filip, was attractive, with a refined,indeterminate accent. He introduced himself as Paul Laurent. He was just ascurious about and attentive to McGowan as Filip had been. The three talked aboutthe potential for collaboration and about their shared belief in telling storiesthat would defend and empower women.McGowan was still figuring out how to tell her own story, and Filip was there tohelp. The two discussed how explicitly McGowan was going to identify Weinstein,and under what circumstances. They talked through what McGowan had said to thepress, what she was writing in the book. During one of their emotionalheart-to-hearts, McGowan told Filip that there was no one else in the world shecould trust."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 36: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter036]HUNTER [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter036]For months, sources had been telling me that Asia Argento, the Italian actress,had a story to tell about Weinstein. Argento’s father, Dario, was a directorfamous for his horror films. Argento played a glamorous thief in a crime dramaWeinstein had distributed, B. Monkey, and Hollywood had briefly sized up herpotential as a stock exotic femme fatale type, a role she gamely played in theVin Diesel vehicle XXX. But this proved an imperfect fit. There was an edge toArgento, a hint of something dark and maybe damaged.As with so many others, conversations with her agents and managers haddead-ended. But I had followed Argento on social media and we’d begun “liking”each other’s photos. The day I first spoke to Arquette, Argento and I exchangedmessages too. Soon after, we were on the phone.Argento was terrified, her voice shaking. In a series of long and oftenemotional interviews, she told me that Weinstein assaulted her while they wereworking together. In 1997, she was invited to what she understood to be a partythrown by Miramax at the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc, on the French Riviera. Theinvitation came from Fabrizio Lombardo, the head of Miramax Italy—though severalexecutives and assistants told me that his title was a thin cover for his actualrole, as Weinstein’s “pimp” in Europe. Lombardo denied it then and has since.He also denied what Argento told me next: that Lombardo led her not to a partybut to Weinstein’s hotel room. She recalled Lombardo telling her, “Oh, we gothere too early,” before he left her alone with Weinstein. At first, Weinsteinwas solicitous, praising her work. Then he left the room. When he returned, hewas wearing a bathrobe and holding a bottle of lotion. “He asks me to give amassage. I was like, ‘Look, man, I am no fucking fool,’” Argento told me. “But,looking back, I am a fucking fool.”Argento said that, after she reluctantly agreed to give Weinstein a massage, hepulled her skirt up, forced her legs apart, and performed oral sex on her as sherepeatedly told him to stop. “It wouldn’t stop,” she told me. “It was anightmare.” At some point, she stopped saying no and feigned enjoyment, becauseshe thought it was the only way the assault would end. “I was not willing,” shetold me. “I said, ‘No, no, no.’… It’s twisted. A big, fat man wanting to eatyou. It’s a scary fairy tale.” Argento, who insisted that she wanted to tell herstory in all its complexity, said that she didn’t physically fight him off,something that prompted years of guilt.“The thing with being a victim is I felt responsible,” she said. “Because if Iwere a strong woman, I would have kicked him in the balls and run away. But Ididn’t. And so I felt responsible.” She described the incident as a “horribletrauma.” Afterward, Argento said, “He kept contacting me.” She described it as“almost stalking.” For a few months, Weinstein seemed obsessed, offering herexpensive gifts. What complicated the story, Argento readily allowed, was thatshe eventually yielded to his further advances. “He made it sound like he was myfriend and he really appreciated me.” She had occasional sexual encounters withhim over the course of the ensuing years. The first time, several months afterthe alleged assault, came before the release of B. Monkey. “I felt I had to,”she said. “Because I had the movie coming out and I didn’t want to anger him.”She believed that Weinstein would ruin her career if she didn’t comply. Yearslater, when she was a single mother dealing with childcare, Weinstein offered topay for a nanny. She said that she felt “obliged” to submit to his sexualadvances. She described the encounters as one-sided and “onanistic.”This was the complex reality of sexual assault for so many survivors: these wereoften crimes perpetrated by bosses, family members, people you can’t avoidafterward. Argento told me that she knew the later contact would be used toattack the credibility of her allegation. She offered a variety of explanationsfor why she returned to Weinstein. She was intimidated, worn down by hisstalking. The initial assault made her feel overpowered each time sheencountered Weinstein, even years later. “When I see him, it makes me feellittle and stupid and weak.” She broke down as she struggled to explain. “Afterthe rape,” she said, “he won.”Argento embodied, more than any other source, a collision of complications.After her involvement in my reporting, she reached a financial settlement withan actor, Jimmy Bennett, who alleged she had sex with him when he was seventeen.She stood accused of child abuse. In California, where Bennett said the incidenttook place, it would be illegal, statutory rape. Argento’s attorney laterdisputed Bennett’s account, accusing him of “sexually attacking” Argento andstating that, while the payment was an appeasement gesture, the arrangementdidn’t bar Bennett from disclosing his claim. But the press observed thehypocrisy of Argento’s use of a settlement, given her own claims ofvictimization by someone who so routinely employed them.The later settlement had no bearing on an undeniable truth: Argento’s storyabout Harvey Weinstein checked out, with corroboration from people who had seenthings or been told at the time. Perpetrators of sexual abuse can also besurvivors of it. Any psychologist familiar with sex offenders will tell you,indeed, that they often are. But this idea found little purchase in anenvironment where victims were expected to be saints and otherwise weredisregarded as sinners. The women who spoke that summer were just people.Acknowledging that all did a courageous thing—Argento included—does not excuseany choices made in the years that followed.Even before that later scandal, Argento was a lightning rod. As agonizing as thesocial stigma was for every source in the story, in Italy, as Gutierrez’s casehad illustrated, the cultural context was still more viciously sexist. After herallegation against Weinstein, the Italian press branded Argento a “whore.”In our calls that fall, Argento seemed aware that her reputation was toocheckered, the environment in Italy too savage, for her to survive the process.“I don’t give a fuck about my reputation, I’ve already destroyed that myselfover the years, as a result of many traumatic experiences, including this,” shetold me. “It will definitely destroy my life, my career, everything.” I told herthe choice was hers alone, but that I believed it would help the other women. AsArgento grappled with the decision, her partner, the television personality andchef Anthony Bourdain, interceded repeatedly. He told her to keep going, that itwas worth it, that it would make a difference. Argento decided to go on therecord.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The stories multiplied. Sorvino pointed me to Sophie Dix, an English actresswho, years earlier, told her a horror story. Dix had appeared in theWeinstein-distributed Colin Firth film The Advocate in the early nineties andthen slipped from the spotlight. When I reached her, she was at firstapprehensive. “I’m really scared he’ll come after me,” she wrote at one point.“Maybe I shouldn’t stand up and be counted.” But over the course of half a dozencalls, she told me that Weinstein had invited her to his hotel room to viewfootage from their film, then pushed her onto a bed, tugging her clothes off.She’d fled to a bathroom, hidden for a time, then opened the door to findWeinstein masturbating on the other side of it. She’d been able to escape whenroom service knocked on the door. It was “a classic case” of “someone notunderstanding the word ‘no,’” she told me. “I must have said no a thousandtimes.”Like all of the allegations that made it into the story, Dix’s account wasbacked up by, among other things, people she had told, in detail, at the time.Dix’s friends and colleagues were sympathetic but did nothing. Colin Firth, likeTarantino, would later join the ranks of men in the industry who publiclyapologized for hearing without really listening. Dix told enough people thatWeinstein called her later that year, telling her, “I’m sorry, and is thereanything I can do for you?” She sensed, despite the apology, a note of menace.She got off the phone quickly. Afterward, Dix felt disillusioned about theindustry, began to drift from acting. She was, by the time we spoke, working asa writer and producer. She feared fallout among the industry colleagues she nowdepended upon to get films made. The actress Rachel Weisz was part of acontingent of friends who convinced her it was worth the risk. Dix put her namein the story, too.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Argento, in turn, helped me reach French actress Emma de Caunes. De Caunes toldme how she’d met Weinstein in 2010, at a party at the Cannes Film Festival, and,a few months later, received an invitation to a lunch meeting with him at theRitz, in Paris. In the meeting, Weinstein told de Caunes that he was going to beproducing a movie with a prominent director, that he planned to shoot it inFrance, that it had a strong female role. As in Dix’s story and Canosa’s, therewas an excuse to adjourn to his room: the project, he said, was an adaptation ofa book whose title he could tell her, if only they could go upstairs to retrievehis copy.De Caunes, wise to this, replied that she had to leave, since she was alreadyrunning late for a TV show she was hosting. But Weinstein had pleaded until sheagreed. In the room, he disappeared into a bathroom, leaving the door open. Sheassumed that he was washing his hands, until the shower went on. “I was like,What the fuck, is he taking a shower?”Weinstein came out, naked and with an erection. He demanded that she lie on thebed and told her that many other women had done so before her. “I was verypetrified,” de Caunes said. “But I didn’t want to show him that I was petrified,because I could feel that the more I was freaking out, the more he was excited.”She added, “It was like a hunter with a wild animal. The fear turns him on.” DeCaunes told Weinstein that she was leaving. He panicked. “We haven’t doneanything!” she remembered him saying. “It’s like being in a Walt Disney movie!”De Caunes told me, “I looked at him and I said—it took all my courage, but Isaid, ‘I’ve always hated Walt Disney movies.’ And then I left. I slammed thedoor.” Weinstein called relentlessly over the next few hours, offering de Caunesgifts and repeating his assertion that nothing had happened. A director she wasworking with on the TV show confirmed that she arrived at the studio distraughtand that she recounted what had happened.De Caunes, who was in her early thirties at the time, was already an establishedactress. But she wondered what would happen to younger and more vulnerable womenin the same situation. She, too eventually went on the record—for their sake. “Iknow that everybody—I mean everybody—in Hollywood knows that it’s happening,” deCaunes told me. “He’s not even really hiding. I mean, the way he does it, somany people are involved and see what’s happening. But everyone’s too scared tosay anything.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 37: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter037]HEIST [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter037]Virtually every day, I encountered dead ends. Some accusers declined to talk atall. All summer, I’d pursued Lauren O’Connor, a former literary scout at theWeinstein Company. In 2015, she’d written an internal memo complaining aboutWeinstein’s behavior with employees. He’d been verbally abusive to her, andshe’d learned of his predation. At one point, a young woman had pounded on herhotel-room door, crying, shaking, and eventually recounting a familiar storyabout Weinstein propositioning her for a massage. “I am a 28 year old womantrying to make a living and a career,” O’Connor wrote in the memo. “HarveyWeinstein is a 64 year old, world famous man and this is his company. Thebalance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.” But O’Connor had signed anondisclosure agreement and was still too afraid to talk. Late that September,an intermediary called to say that O’Connor had consulted a lawyer and made herfinal decision. “She is terrified and will not engage. With anyone,” theintermediary told me. O’Connor didn’t want me to use her name.It was a blow. I had her name from documents. But the intermediary had describedO’Connor’s raw panic. I was painfully aware that I was a man writing a storyabout women’s consent, confronting a woman saying she didn’t want her lifeupended in this way. Eventually, she would begin to tell her story publicly. Butat the time, I promised I wouldn’t include her.Then there were those who hesitated. The actress Claire Forlani would later postan open letter on social media about her struggle over whether to describe to meher claim that Weinstein had harassed her. “I told some close men around me andthey all advised me not to speak,” she wrote. “I had already told Ronan I wouldspeak with him but from the advice around me, interestingly the male advicearound me, I didn’t make the call.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]I canvassed Hollywood for more leads. Some of Weinstein’s contacts seemedsincerely to know little about the claims surrounding him. Late that September,I reached Meryl Streep, who had made films with Weinstein for years, includingThe Iron Lady, the Margaret Thatcher biopic that had won Streep her most recentOscar. When we connected, Streep was hosting a fiftieth reunion with schoolfriends. “I am hosting and cooking tearing my hair,” Streep wrote.“Sounds like you’ve been in a maelstrom there,” I said, on the phone. Shereplied, not missing a beat, “a femalestrom.”She hummed along, luminous and buoyant, asking who it was I was reporting on.I told her Harvey Weinstein. Streep gasped. “But he supports such good causes,”she said. Weinstein had always behaved around her. She’d watched and sometimesjoined in his Democratic fund-raising and philanthropy. She knew him to be abully in the edit room. But that was it.“I believe her,” I told Jonathan later.“But you would either way, right?” he replied, considering it a thoughtexercise.“Yeah, I get it.”“Because she’s Meryl—”“Because she’s Meryl Streep. I get it.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Other industry veterans I spoke with sounded a different note. Weinstein’spredation was an open secret, they said, and if they hadn’t seen it, they’dheard about at least some of it. Susan Sarandon, the kind of ethical futuristwho had stubbornly refused to work with accused predators for years, gamelybrainstormed leads. She let out a cackle when I told her what I was up to. “Oh,Ronan,” she said, going into a teasing, singsong delivery. Not mocking, justdelighting at the impending drama about to befall me. “You’re gonna be introuble.”Still others appeared to report back to Weinstein. When I reached the directorBrett Ratner, I implored him to keep the conversation in strict confidence. Itold him there were vulnerable women who might get blowback if Weinstein becameagitated. “Do you feel comfortable not repeating anything I mention, for theirsake?” I asked. Ratner promised he wouldn’t. He said he knew of a woman whomight have a story about Weinstein. But he sounded jittery. Months later, sixwomen would accuse Ratner of sexual harassment in a Los Angeles Timesreport—though he denied several of their claims. He informed Weinstein of myinquiry almost immediately.“Harvey says Brett Ratner called him and now he’s all spun up,” Berger told me,in the this-is-gonna-be-the-death-of-me inflection that by then dominated ourexchanges. Berger had been supportive of the story, if occasionally fretfulabout its effect on my professional prospects. “It’s causing too many speedbumps,” he said. “Either run it or move on.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Weinstein was doing canvassing of his own. As September turned to October, hesought out the figure at the heart of his claims that I had a conflict ofinterest. Weinstein had his assistants place the call. On a movie set in CentralPark, another assistant brought a phone to Woody Allen.Weinstein seemed to want a strategic playbook—for quashing sexual assaultallegations, and for dealing with me. “How did you deal with this?” Weinsteinasked at one point. He wanted to know if Allen would intercede on his behalf.Allen shut down the idea. But he did have knowledge that Weinstein would laterput to use. That week, Weinstein’s credit card receipts show his purchase of abook of interviews with Allen, written by a die-hard fan of his, documenting allof the arguments Allen and his army of private investigators and publicists hadcome up with to smear the credibility of my sister, the district attorney, and ajudge who had suggested she was telling the truth.“Jeez, I’m so sorry,” Allen told Weinstein on the call. “Good luck.”Weinstein was also placing calls to my sources, sometimes frightening them. Theday after I received the legal demand letter from Harder and company, Weinsteincalled Canosa again. It was Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement, but thisseemed not to inform the sentiment of the call. He told her that he knew peoplewere talking. “You’d never do something like that to me,” he said. Unsure ifthis was a question or a threat, Canosa got off the phone shaken. I told Remnicksources were getting jittery, that Weinstein appeared to be redoubling hisefforts to shut people up. “I fast and he threatens,” Remnick replied. “Judaismcomes in many forms.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Late that month, Weinstein met again with his team in the back room of theTribeca Grill. He had been there for some time, huddled with his lawyers,discussing the latest developments in the amfAR story. Then there was a changingof the guard, some of the team members focused on that scandal shifting out asseveral operatives from Black Cube arrived. Their update was triumphant. “We gotsomething good for you,” one of them said, smiling. They’d been mindful of theways they’d fallen short earlier, but this time they’d gone big. They’d obtaineda crucial, elusive piece of property that Weinstein had sought all summer long,and described the elaborate heist that had achieved this.There were three Black Cube operatives present that day: Yanus, the director,was there, and the project manager who worked under him; the third member of theteam was a working-level employee who had been deeply involved in the operation.In a white shirt and blazer, she evinced crisp professionalism. She was blond,with high cheekbones, a strong nose, and an elegant, hard-to-place accent. Shewas introduced, in her meetings with Weinstein, as Anna.Anna was deferential to Yanus and their colleague, letting them direct theconversation. When they turned to her, she explained, with enthusiasm, the manymonths she’d spent gaining an important target’s trust and secretly recordinghours of conversation. Then, as Weinstein’s eyes widened, and he muttered, “Ohmy God, oh my God,” the Black Cube operatives read aloud what they said were thepassages about Weinstein from Rose McGowan’s forthcoming book."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter038]CELEBRITY [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter038]Throughout September, The New Yorker’s work on the story picked up pace andintensity. Foley-Mendelssohn and Remnick and the rest of the team scrutinizedthe accumulating reporting and pored over drafts. I stayed at the World TradeCenter late, making reporting calls. Arriving home near dawn one day, I saw asilver Nissan Pathfinder parked outside and felt a cold jolt of recognition. Istill had no proof that I was being followed, but a jittery suspicion persisted.A few friends had offered to put me up that summer, and mostly theseconversations had ended with a laugh from me and a promise that I was okay. Onlyone of those friends, Sophie, the daughter of a wealthy executive, said she wasaccustomed to security threats and told me to take my suspicions seriously. Shesaid to call her if I needed somewhere safe to stay. Finally, I did.At the end of that month, I packed up my things and moved into what would becomemy safe house: a section of a building in Chelsea where Sophie’s family ownedseveral floors. It was a space to comfortably house everyone you’ve ever met.The rooms were proportioned like airplane hangars—imposing and beautiful andfull of ornate couches you’d be afraid to sit on and objets d’art you’d beafraid to touch.The place had several layers of security: card, physical key, code. I feltsafer. But I still couldn’t shake the paranoia that I was being watched. “I’msaying get a gun,” Polone had said. And I’d laughed. But later, as others saidthe same thing, I started to consider it. At a range in New Jersey, I brushed upon pistols and revolvers. I told myself this was just recreational. But, aiminga Glock 19 downrange, feeling its weight, squeezing the trigger, I felt nervyand flushed, and not much like a guy with a hobby.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The signs that the New York Times was closing in on the story were picking up,too. I’d learned that two respected investigative reporters—Kantor, who’d beenmentioned in the dossiers sent by the private investigators, and MeganTwohey—were leading the paper’s effort. They were formidable, chasing sourcesjust as aggressively as I had. After Arquette and Nestor received calls, I toldthem they should work with whomever they were comfortable with. “In the end it’sgood for us all that multiple people are working on this,” I texted Nestor. Iwas sincerely glad the Times was there to draw some of the heat and ensure thestory saw the light of day, whatever happened to my effort. But privately, I wasalso feeling competitive, with some self-pity mixed in. For six months, the onlysupport I’d had was Noah Oppenheim scrunching his nose and holding journalism atarm’s length, afraid it might get on him. Now, finally, I had The New Yorker,but it might be too late. I had no idea what the Times had. For all I knew, ifit published first, our work at the magazine would be be rendered moot. The armsrace was another source of pressure, another way in which it felt like I wasworking in an airlock, waiting to be blown out into the vacuum.McHugh texted in late September that he was hearing from his sources that theTimes was on the verge of running something. NBC had banned him from takingcalls about the sexual assault allegations, but he had kept at the story aboutamfAR, the AIDS charity. A source had pointed him to a line item buried in thecharity’s tax returns suggesting that $600,000 had been diverted to the AmericanRepertory Theater, which had incubated Finding Neverland, the musical Weinsteinhad later produced on Broadway and had entreated Gutierrez to see after theirfirst encounter. McHugh had sought permission to work on the story. Greenberg,after conversations with Oppenheim, had appeared to allow it. But the permissionhad been hard-fought, and McHugh felt that the network dragged its feetafterward. “They were slow playing it,” he lamented later. He wasn’t surewhether they wanted him to be reporting, or just wanted the appearance of nothaving killed two stories about Weinstein in rapid succession.“Twohey filed her story today,” McHugh wrote to me. We debated about what mightbe in the Times story—whether it was their main story about sexual misconduct atall. “Either way,” McHugh wrote, “it’s showtime soon for Harvey.”Weinstein and Dylan Howard were having a similar conversation that day. The bondbetween the two men continued to grow stronger. “Dear Dylan,” Weinstein wroteafter Twohey filed, “I just wanted to let you know that the New York Times aregoing to be posting their article today.”The next day, there was a Times breaking news alert about Weinstein. I clickedthrough. “It’s all amfAR,” McHugh texted. It was a false alarm.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]“How quickly can you get it out?” asked McHugh. “Get Remnick aware of theWeinstein news swirl. You’ve got the story. Time to get it out.” Auletta,calling in anxiously, applied similar pressure: “Hurry! Meet with him stat, thenget this online.”I badgered Foley-Mendelssohn and then Remnick. He was fiercely competitive, butthe magazine’s priorities were accuracy and caution. “We’re not going to race tobeat anyone,” Remnick told me. The story would be ready when it was ready, afteran intensive fact-checking process. “We’re an ocean liner, not a speedboat. Wealways knew that the Times might scoop us.”Nevertheless, Remnick dug into editing, peppering me with questions as he went(“Where is the Weinstein Co? Why does he stay in hotels all the time?”). When Iwasn’t meeting with or calling sources, I was holed up with Foley-Mendelssohn orwith Remnick, chiseling away at the language of the piece. We debated when toseek comment from Weinstein. “The sooner we speak to him the better,” I wrote tothe editors.Remnick decided, in the interest of fairness and to limit Weinstein’s ability tobadger the women whose names we would be revealing when we sought comment, tocomplete as much of the fact-checking as possible before we called Weinstein.Peter Canby, the magazine’s veteran head of fact-checking, assigned twocheckers, for speed and added scrutiny. For one of the checking roles,Foley-Mendelssohn suggested E. Tammy Kim, a former attorney with a cool andserious disposition. When she was approached about the job, Kim folded her armsand said, unsmiling, “Is this gonna be a celebrity thing or something?” Theother assignment went to Fergus McIntosh, a young Scot who had joined themagazine two years earlier after finishing his studies at Oxford. McIntosh waspolite to a proper British standard and a little shy. On September 27, Kim andMcIntosh began their work on the story, moving fast, putting in grueling hours,calling source after source after source."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 39: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter039]FALLOUT [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter039]In New York City, the rippling heat wavered but did not break. Both my sourcesand Weinstein’s intermediaries who periodically called to sound notes of menacewere spread across time zones—Europe, Australia, China. At all hours, my phonefelt like a ticking bomb. Sleep was becoming an involuntary reflex, a briefmoment when, with a harsh crack like a light switch, I blinked and the shadowshad changed, and I’d been out for an hour, my face embossed with the grain ofwhatever desk at The New Yorker I’d borrowed that night. I hoped Jeffrey Toobinor Dexter Filkins or whichever other reporter wouldn’t have occasion to discoverall this drooling on their mouse pads. When I made it back to Chelsea to liedown, I managed only twilight half-sleep. In the mirrors around the place, Ilooked drawn and pale and thinner than I had at the beginning of the summer,like a consumptive child in an ad for some Victorian-era tonic.As the fact-checkers began calling sources widely, Weinstein picked up histhreats. On the first Monday of October, he sent his first legal letter to TheNew Yorker. “This law firm, along with my co-counsel, David Boise, Esq. of BoiseSchiller Flexner LLP and Lisa Bloom, Esq. of The Bloom Firm, are litigationcounsel for The Weinstein Company,” Charles Harder wrote this time. Thereporting was “defamatory,” he argued. “We demand that you refrain frompublishing this story; provide TWC with a list of all statements about TWC(including its employees and/or executives) that you intend to publish.” Therewas the expected invocation of NBC: “Importantly, NBC News was previouslyworking with Ronan Farrow regarding a potential story about TWC. However, afterreviewing Mr. Farrow’s work, NBC News rejected the story, and terminated theproject. It would be troubling if The New Yorker were to take Mr. Farrow’s workproduct, rejected by NBC News, and publish it—thereby exposing The New Yorker toliability and tremendous damages in connection therewith.”Weinstein’s recent conversation with Woody Allen appeared to inform the letter.Harder devoted several pages to the argument that my sister’s sexual assaultdisqualified me from reporting on Weinstein. “Mr. Farrow is entitled to hisprivate anger,” Harder wrote. “But no publisher should allow those personalfeelings to create and pursue a baseless and defamatory story from his personalanimus.” He went on to quote the book Weinstein had purchased by the Woody Allenbiographer, and to echo Allen’s argument that I’d been brainwashed into findingmy sister’s claim credible.There were other colorful personal arguments. “As a second example, RonanFarrow’s uncle, John Charles Villers-Farrow, was prosecuted, pled guilty andsentenced to ten (10) years in prison for sexually abusing two boys. We have yetto find any evidence that Ronan Farrow has publicly denounced his uncle, and hemight have publicly supported him. Either way, and in light of Mr. Farrow’soutspoken criticism of his estranged father, Mr. Farrow’s actions call intoquestion his credibility and perspective as a journalist.”As far as I could recall, I’d never met that uncle. My understanding was thatthe case against him was credible. My mother and his daughter had both cut himout of their lives. I’d never been asked about my extended family members whoweren’t public figures. Had I been, I wouldn’t have avoided the subject. Whatany of this had to do with the allegations against Weinstein was unclear.I was struck by how closely the arguments in the letter mirrored the talkingpoints Oppenheim had recited to me. And I was reminded of the op-eds andtelevision appearances Bloom had devoted to defending my sister’s credibilityand burnishing her own brand as an advocate for women. I was becoming inured topeople contorting their bodies into the shapes of gears for Harvey Weinstein’smachine. But I still wondered at Bloom’s name at the end of the letter,alongside Harder’s.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The first week of October, Weinstein’s assistants emailed Dylan Howard: “We justtried you, but Harvey wanted to see if you could instead meet him in front ofthe NY Times Building on 8th Ave near 43rd Street. He’s on his way up there noso should be there in about 30 minutes.” Originally, Weinstein had asked hisstaff to make sure Howard joined him and Lisa Bloom for the drive uptown fromthe Weinstein Company offices to the Times. But Bloom and Weinstein had leftwithout Howard, so the Enquirer editor would have to scramble uptown himself,manila folders in hand, containing “basically dirt” on Weinstein’s accusers, bythe recollection of one person involved. Howard later disputed that he ever wentto the Times building. What’s not in dispute is that Weinstein was soon in themeeting, hearing that the Times was preparing to publish its story about sexualmisconduct.When sources reached me with the same message, I was in a cab. I tried Jonathan,then tried him again. He was increasingly busy with work, and I was increasinglyneedy and annoying.“What?!” he snapped, when he finally called back. He was stepping out of anothermeeting.“The Times is running,” I said.“Okay,” he said, a little impatiently. “You knew they might.”“It’s good it’s breaking,” I said. “It’s just—all these months. This whole year.And now I have no job.” I was losing it, actually starting to cry. “I swung toowide. I gambled too much. And maybe I won’t even have a story at the end of it.And I’m letting down all these women—”“Calm down!” Jonathan shouted, snapping me out of it. “All that’s happeningright now is you haven’t slept or eaten in two weeks.”A horn sounded outside.“Are you in a cab?” he asked.“Uh-huh,” I sniffled.“Oh my God. We are going to talk about this, but first you are going to tip thatdriver really well.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]After the letter from Weinstein and Harder came in, Remnick called me into hisoffice, along with Bertoni and Foley-Mendelssohn. Weinstein’s legal argument, inorder of ascending absurdity and descending seriousness, was that anythingnegative about him was defamatory; that reporting on any company that used NDAswas impermissible; that he had cut a deal with NBC; that my sister was sexuallyassaulted; and that there was a child molester in my extended family. (Jonathanhowled with laughter at it. “This letter is adorable,” he said. “I love thisletter.”) But I’d watched a news organization internalize thin arguments before.As I filed into Remnick’s office, part of me was still braced for capitulationor skittishness. He said plainly, “This is the most disgusting letter I’ve evergotten about a story.”Still a little apprehensive, I reminded Remnick that Weinstein was alsothreatening to sue me personally and that I didn’t have a lawyer. “I want to beclear,” he said. “We will defend you legally, no matter how far Harvey Weinsteingoes.” Bertoni responded briefly to Harder: “With regard to your statementsabout the independence and ethics of Mr. Farrow, we find the issues you raise tobe without any merit whatsoever.”As I left work that evening, Remnick called to say that Asia Argento’s partner,Anthony Bourdain, had contacted him. Bourdain had been supportive of Argentospeaking before, but even so, my heart sank: over and over, women who hadwithdrawn from the story had done so after an intervention from a husband, aboyfriend, a father. Outreach from significant others was seldom good news. Butthere are exceptions to every rule: Bourdain said Weinstein’s predation wassickening, that “everyone” had known about it for too long. “I am not areligious man,” he wrote. “But I pray you have the strength to run this story.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The New Yorker team rallied around the reporting, which was proving out, oneallegation after another, under pressure from the fact-checkers. We were stillwaiting until all the claims were fully checked before seeking comment fromWeinstein. But several Weinstein intermediaries had already made contact, theirtone not combative but resigned. One member of his legal team took theextraordinary step of calling the magazine shortly after Harder’s letterarrived, saying that the threats in it had been wrong, inadvisable. “This is nota situation where I’m telling you you’re getting it wrong,” that attorney said.“The allegations of gross improper conduct—a great many of the instances aretrue.”The temperature rose, turning Foley-Mendelssohn’s office into a sweatbox. Sheand I sat bowed over print-outs of the draft, with perspiration beading on ourforeheads. There was impassioned debate over choices of language, Remnickpressing for caution wherever possible. Initially, we’d excluded the term“rape,” fearing it might be distracting or prejudicial. Foley-Mendelssohn andKim, the fact-checker, pushed back. To exclude the word, they argued, would be awhitewash. In the end, Remnick and Bertoni agreed, and the word stayed in.One of those days, I stepped out of the heat and into Remnick’s apartment on theUpper West Side. Outside, at the margin of the building’s limestone facade,there was a tin Fallout Shelter sign. Inside, a double-height living room waslined with books. Remnick’s wife, the former Times reporter Esther Fein, shooedme into the kitchen, insisting I eat. The couple met in the late eighties andwent to Moscow on assignment for rival papers, Remnick for the Washington Post.The family had preserved a section of wall bearing the recorded heights of itstwo sons and one daughter through their years of growth, just like in themovies. In his small home office, Remnick and I fine-tuned the draft. I wasfrazzled and sleep-deprived, and he was generous, even when I was dead wrongabout edits.If this passed for calm, there was a sense that it was before a large storm.Early that first week of October, Kim Masters ran a story for the HollywoodReporter, headlined “Harvey Weinstein Lawyers Battling N.Y. Times, New YorkerOver Potentially Explosive Stories.” Variety ran its version a few minuteslater. The cable news cycle began to chatter. This development had the upside ofemboldening sources. That day, the actress Jessica Barth, who had appeared inthe Ted films with Seth MacFarlane, reached out to tell me that Weinstein hadsexually harassed her during a hotel-room meeting—a story that ultimatelychecked out. But the headlines also made me feel exposed. Whatever happened nextwould take place under stadium lights."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 40: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter040]DINOSAUR [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter040]The world was changing around Harvey Weinstein that October. He looked haggard.Fits of rage were his baseline, but the outbursts that month were more erraticthan usual. Inside the Weinstein Company he grew suspicious. It would later bereported that he’d been monitoring the work communications of Irwin Reiter, whosent Nestor the sympathetic messages and whom Weinstein had branded “the SexPolice.” On October 3, Weinstein had an IT specialist pull up and delete a fileentitled “HW friends” that mapped out the locations and contact information ofdozens of women in cities around the world.On the morning of October 5, Weinstein summoned much of his defense team to hisoffices on Greenwich Street, where a makeshift war room took shape in agreenroom. Bloom was there, and Howard. Pam Lubell and Denise Doyle Chambers,the veteran employees who had been brought back to help assemble the targetlist, were also there, not very confused about the status of their bookproposal. Davis and Harder called in, the assistants placing them onspeakerphone. Weinstein was crazed, shouting at the top of his lungs. The Timesstory hadn’t broken yet, but he had been told it was imminent. He roared nameafter name at Lubell and Doyle Chambers and the assistants, of board members andallies in the entertainment industry who he hoped would defend him after thestories started breaking. Bloom and others pored over printed and digitalpictures that showed ongoing contact between Weinstein and women on the targetlist: McGowan and Judd, on his arm, smiling politely. “He was screaming at us,‘Send these to the board members,’” Lubell later recalled. And she dutifullysent them on.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Farther downtown, I took a seat at a vacant desk at The New Yorker and calledthe Weinstein Company for comment. Sounding nervous, the front desk assistant Ireached said he’d check if Weinstein was available. And then there wasWeinstein’s husky baritone. “Wow!” he said with mock excitement. “What do I owethis occasion to?” The writing about the man before and after seldom lingered onthis quality: he was pretty funny. But this was easy to forget as he veeredswiftly toward fury. Weinstein hung up on me several times that fall, includingon that first day. I told him I wanted to be fair, to include anything he had tosay, then asked if he was comfortable with my recording. He seemed to panic, andwas gone with a click. The pattern repeated that afternoon. But when I got himto talk for a sustained time, he abandoned his initial caution, didn’t put theconversation off the record, just got sharply combative.“How did you identify yourself to all these women?” he demanded.I was caught off balance a little.“Depending on the timing, I accurately described the outlet.” I started to saythat this wouldn’t help us hear him out on the allegations, but he jumped inagain.“Oh, really? Like you’re a reporter at NBC. And what do your friends at NBC haveto say about that now?” I felt a flush rising in my cheeks.“I’m calling because I want to hear you out,” I said.“No. I know what you want. I know you’re scared, and alone, and your bossesabandoned you, and your father—”Remnick was outside at this point, tapping on the glass quietly. He shook hishead, made a “wrap it up” gesture.“I’m happy to talk to you, or whomever you want on your team,” I said.Weinstein laughed. “You couldn’t save someone you love, and now you think youcan save everyone.” He really said this. You’d think he was pointing a detonatorat Aquaman.Weinstein told me to send all my questions to Lisa Bloom. By the end of thecalls, he was charming again, politely thanking me.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]At just after 2:00 p.m., phones chimed and an assistant walked into theWeinstein Company greenroom with the news about the Times. “The article’s up,”the assistant said. “Oh shit,” said Dylan Howard, and asked staffers to printcopies for everyone. As the team read the article, the tension broke. For abrief moment, Weinstein was relieved. It was good news, he told the assembledstaffers, that the story had come out on a Thursday rather than a Sunday, whichhe deemed to be the Times’s preferred real estate for major stories. Then hedeparted to see his wife, Georgina Chapman, who was attending a fashion show forher clothing label, Marchesa. “She said, ‘I’ll stick with you,’” Weinstein toldseveral of the team members when he got back. But he was already turning to thereporting still to come. After the New Yorker story, he said under his breath,“She’s gonna leave me.”Foley-Mendelssohn and I sat opposite Remnick in his office and read the Timesarticle, him on a monitor, the two of us scrolling on our phones. The story waspowerful, with Ashley Judd finally attaching Weinstein’s name to the accountshe’d given Variety two years earlier about unwanted advances from a producer,which finally made sense of the odd call I’d had with Nick Kristof monthsearlier. It also discussed O’Connor’s story about verbal abuse, and Nestor’sabout workplace propositions, though without their involvement.There were no allegations of assault or rape. Lisa Bloom quickly put out astatement, referring to the allegations as, mostly, a matter ofmisunderstanding. “I have explained to him that due to the power differencebetween a major studio head like him and most others in the industry, whateverhis motives, some of his words and behaviors can be perceived as inappropriate,even intimidating.” Weinstein was just an “old dinosaur learning new ways,” sheargued. By the next day’s morning programs, Bloom was working to frame theallegations in the Times piece as mild indiscretions. “You’re using the termsexual harassment, which is a legal term,” she said to George Stephanopoulos.“I’m using the term workplace misconduct. I don’t know if there’s a realsignificant difference, to most people, but sexual harassment is severe andpervasive.” She said that she’d counseled Weinstein sternly against talking inthe office “the way you talk to your guy friends, you know, when you’re goingout for a beer.” Weinstein, in his own statements, said that he “came of age inthe ’60s and ’70s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces weredifferent,” and professed to be on a “journey” to “learn about myself,” with“Lisa Bloom to tutor me.” Weinstein pledged to devote himself to fighting theNational Rifle Association. As far as Bloom and Weinstein were concerned, hewould get therapy, start a foundation for female directors at USC, and thatwould be that.In Remnick’s office, I looked up from the Times story. My phone vibrated on thedesk, a text from Jonathan. “Times ran. They have harassment, not assault,” hewrote. “Race race race.” And then, rapidly, another text from McHugh, making thesame point. The Times, he added, had “less than what we were stopped for.”“It’s very strong work,” Remnick said, looking up from the story.“But they don’t have anywhere near what we have,” Foley-Mendelssohn said, withundisguised relief.“So we keep going,” I ventured.“We do,” Remnick said."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 41: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter041]MEAN [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter041]After declaring his relief at the Times story and its timing, Weinstein issuedwhat was supposed to be a galvanizing message to the staff. “Roll up yoursleeves,” he announced. “We’re going to war.” One assistant responded, “I’mdone, Harvey,” and left. Weinstein said to stop, offered to write a glowingrecommendation. “I looked at him like are you fucking kidding me?” the assistantrecalled.That evening, the Weinstein Company board of directors convened an emergencyconference call. The nine members of the all-male board would be on the line,including Weinstein. For several years, rancor had deepened between a smallgroup of directors seeking to oust Weinstein and a majority of loyalists whoconsidered him indispensable to the company’s success. With painful frequency,stories of abuse by powerful people are also stories of a failure of boardculture. Weinstein and his brother, Bob, held two seats on the board, and thecompany’s charter allowed them to name a third. Over time, Weinstein was able toinstall loyalists in many of the remaining seats, too. By 2015, when Weinstein’scontract was due to be renewed, he essentially controlled six out of nine boardseats, and used that influence to evade accountability. When an adversarialboard member, Lance Maerov, demanded to see Weinstein’s personnel file, Boiesand Weinstein were able to prevail in preventing this, instead enlisting anoutside attorney to render a hazy summary of its contents. Maerov later told aFortune writer that there had been a cover-up.That evening in early October, Weinstein got on the phone with the board. Hedenied everything, then argued that the Times story would blow over. The calldevolved into bitter recrimination between the factions within the board andbetween the Weinstein brothers. “I’ve never heard such mean people all around,”Lubell recalled. “You know, Bob: ‘I’m gonna finish you, Harvey, you’re done!’Harvey: ‘We’re gonna open up the books on you!’”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]In the small hours after the emergency board meeting and on into the followingmorning, Weinstein bombarded his allies with emotional calls and emails. Amongthem were executives at NBC and Comcast. Meyer, the NBCUniversal vice chairman,reached out. (“Dear Ron,” Weinstein responded that morning. “I just got yourmessage, and thank you—I will. I’m on my way to LA. All my best, Harvey.” Thetwo men agreed to talk.)At 1:44 a.m. on October 6, Weinstein sent an email to Brian Roberts, the head ofComcast, Noah Oppenheim’s boss’s boss’s boss, calling in a favor. “Dear Brian,”he wrote. “There comes a moment in everyone’s life when someone needs something,and right now, I could use some support.”In Auletta’s files, I’d found a taped interview with Roberts, in which he’dserved as a rare defender of Weinstein against those who characterized him as abully. “It’s been sort of a joy,” Roberts said of Weinstein’s and hisfriendship, and their time spent hobnobbing in New York and on Martha’sVineyard. “I don’t personally get put off by all these Hollywoodisms,” Robertssaid of Weinstein’s personality. “I look and see a guy who is doing great thingsand built a company.” Roberts called Weinstein a good father, a good person. “Ithink,” Roberts added, “he’s like a teddy bear.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Comcast, NBC’s parent company, was a family business, founded by Roberts’sfather. The company’s articles of incorporation gave Roberts unshakable power:“The Chairman shall be Mr. Brian L. Roberts if he is willing and available toserve…. The CEO shall be Mr. Brian L. Roberts if he is willing and available toserve.” Several executives who worked with Roberts called him mild-mannered orgentle. He was the only person in the corporate chain of command who laterapproached me to apologize, saying that he had daughters and believed in thereporting. But the executives who worked with him also said that Roberts avoidedconflict. On contentious issues, he “doesn’t stand up,” one of them said. “Hewon’t get in the way of Steve doing dirty work”—that is, Steve Burke, who servedunder Roberts as the CEO of NBCUniversal.Burke had a rapport with Weinstein as well. A former member of Weinstein’sstaff—who facilitated Burke’s provision of Minions costumes for theWeinstein-produced show at Radio City Music Hall where the studio head met AmbraGutierrez—described Burke as being “in Weinstein’s pocket.” And the executiveswho worked with Roberts said that Burke was similarly conflict-averse. Onerecalled a case in which another Hollywood power broker and his lawyer began tocall NBC News, demanding that the network not air an interview. The executiverecalled informing Burke that the network intended to proceed with the story,and Burke replying, “Pull it,” adding that the Hollywood power broker “will oweyou his life.”“Steve, oh my God, we will have destroyed the reputation of NBC News,” theexecutive remembered saying. After another member of Burke’s team interceded tomake the same point, Burke agreed to run the story. Prior to his time atNBCUniversal, Burke worked at Disney, with considerable accomplishments in thecompany’s retail and theme park endeavors. But the executives said that he wasless attuned to news media. “I don’t think it’s even about protecting hisfriends, it’s just, ‘This guy is powerful, I’m getting these calls, I don’t needthis problem,’” said the executive who pushed back on Burke’s suggestion thatthey shelve an interview. “He doesn’t know it’s not ethical.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]At NBC News, there were more signs of anxiety about Weinstein. Soon after Twoheypublished her story about the amfAR scandal, McHugh was set to publish what heconsidered a significant follow-up based on his own reporting. At the lastminute, management spiked it. Greenberg, who had for days expressed enthusiasmabout McHugh’s reporting, changed his posture, saying it didn’t sufficientlyadvance the story. It was only after Janice Min, the former Hollywood Reportereditor, tweeted that more Weinstein-related news was languishing at NBC thatGreenberg came back to McHugh and asked if he could revive his work quickly.Oppenheim had said I could finish out the other stories I was still working onfor NBC. But when the next one’s air date arrived, I was told there was no timein the schedule for me to appear on set. Then, when the story was rescheduled, Iwas given the same excuse again. “Noah says Ronan’s not allowed on set,” asenior producer told McHugh. “Did something happen?” Lauer read my introductioninstead.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The night after the Times story ran, CBS News and ABC News prominently coveredthe deepening scandal on their evening programs. Both networks did so again thefollowing morning, airing detailed segments with original interviews. Only NBCdidn’t mention the news that first evening, and only NBC offered no originalreporting the next morning. Instead, Craig Melvin, filling in for Lauer, read ascript that ran less than a minute and was dominated by Weinstein’s rebuttals tothe allegations. That weekend, the pattern repeated: Saturday Night Live, whichhad eagerly riffed on similar stories about Bill O’Reilly, Roger Ailes, andDonald Trump, didn’t mention Weinstein once.Nevertheless, NBC News was quietly shaping the public narrative around thestory. Oppenheim and Kornblau, the head of communications, began talking tomedia reporters. The two executives suggested NBC had only passing involvementin the story. “Oppenheim says Ronan came to him several months ago and said hewanted to pursue sexual harassment, and after about two or three months, neversecured any documentation and never persuaded any women to go on camera,” read amemorandum filed internally within an outlet Oppenheim and Kornblau spoke with.“This was a guy who really didn’t have anything,” Oppenheim said in one of thecalls, “I understand this is very personal for him and he may be emotional aboutit.” Asked if he’d had any contact with Weinstein, Oppenheim laughed and said,“I don’t travel in those circles.”Several people involved later told me that, in those first days after the Timespublished, NBC avoided covering Weinstein at Oppenheim’s direction. “Noahliterally went to them and said, ‘Do not run this story,’” one person recalledof Oppenheim’s conversations with producers at the time. As the storyaccelerated late that week, Oppenheim and a group of senior staff assembled fora routine coverage meeting. “Should we be doing something on this?” one of theproducers present asked. Oppenheim shook his head. “He’ll be fine,” he said ofWeinstein. “He’ll be back in eighteen months. It’s Hollywood.”"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Art_P279.jpg]toc.xhtml#toc-part004"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 42: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter042]EDIFY [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter042]One additional source joined our story after the Times published. A mutualfriend alerted me to an allegation by Lucia Evans, a marketing consultant. Inthe summer of 2004, Weinstein had approached Evans at Cipriani Upstairs, a clubin Manhattan. She was about to start her senior year at Middlebury College andwas, at the time, trying to break into acting. Weinstein got her number and wassoon calling late at night, or having an assistant call her, asking to meet. Shedeclined the late-night advances but said that she would meet with a castingexecutive during the day.When she arrived for the meeting, the building was full of people. She was ledto an office with exercise equipment in it and takeout boxes on the floor.Weinstein was there alone. Evans said that she found him frightening. “Even justhis presence was intimidating,” she told me. In the meeting, Evans recalled, “heimmediately was simultaneously flattering me and demeaning me and making me feelbad about myself.” Weinstein told her that she’d “be great in ProjectRunway”—the show, which Weinstein helped produce, premiered later that year—butonly if she lost weight. He also told her about two scripts, a horror movie anda teen love story, and said one of his associates would discuss them with her.“After that is when he assaulted me,” Evans said. “He forced me to perform oralsex on him.” As she objected, Weinstein took his penis out of his pants andpulled her head down onto it. “I said, over and over, ‘I don’t want to do this,stop, don’t,’” she recalled. “I tried to get away, but maybe I didn’t try hardenough. I didn’t want to kick him or fight him.” In the end, she said, “he’s abig guy. He overpowered me.” She added, “I just sort of gave up. That’s the mosthorrible part of it, and that’s why he’s been able to do this for so long to somany women: people give up, and then they feel like it’s their fault.”She told me that the entire sequence of events had a routine quality. “It feelslike a very streamlined process,” she said. “Female casting director, Harveywants to meet. Everything was designed to make me feel comfortable before ithappened. And then the shame in what happened was also designed to keep mequiet.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]We’d sent a detailed fact-checking memo to Bloom that Friday, and she’d promisedto respond. When we still hadn’t heard back on Saturday, I called. She let it goto voicemail, then texted, “I’m not available today.” When she finally pickedup, I was at Remnick’s place, the two of us huddled over the draft and ourrespective phones. Bloom sounded disconsolate. “What?” she snapped. And then,when I reminded her that Weinstein had asked me to work with her: “I can’t talk!I can’t comment on any of this!” She told me to call Harder, Boies, anyone else.Bloom’s voice gathered into something accusing and injured. She reminded me howpersistently she’d tried to reach me. “For months!” she spat—as if my sharingmore information might have led her to step away from Weinstein. Only Bloom andI had talked and, as far as I could tell, she’d used the occasion to offeropposition research on women, not to solicit information about her client. Ithad been a busy summer for Bloom. She’d also begun representing Roy Price, theAmazon Studios executive, after a harassment allegation against him wasreported—representation she’d end that fall, amid criticism. Forty minutes afterwe got off the phone, Bloom tweeted that she’d resigned. She’d been sendingemails to the Weinstein Company board describing her plans to discredit accusersvirtually until the end.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]With Weinstein’s team in chaos, we decided to go back to the man himself. Overthat weekend and into the following week, I reached him first for less formalcalls, and then for long sessions during which I was joined by Remnick,Foley-Mendelssohn, and Bertoni, and Weinstein by lawyers and crisis advisors.Weinstein had added to his team the public relations firm Sitrick and Company,which handed the assignment to an even-tempered former Los Angeles Timesreporter named Sallie Hofmeister.Large portions of the conversations with Weinstein were placed off the record.But there were also, among the calls, exchanges for which no ground rules wereset, or which Weinstein explicitly placed on the record. At times he soundeddefeated. There could be an almost boyish charm in the small “Hi, Ronan,” at thetop of each call. But more often, there were flashes of the old HarveyWeinstein, arrogant and raging. “Allow me to edify you,” he’d say. “I’m givingyou insights.”Weinstein suggested repeatedly that an interaction wasn’t rape if the woman inquestion came back to him later. That this was at odds with the reality ofsexual assault as it so often transpires within inescapable workplace or familyrelationships—that it was at odds with the law—seemed to escape him. He wasskeptical, too, of the theme of retaliation that ran through the women’s claims.“There’s no retaliating in Hollywood,” he said, calling the concept of powerfulmen intimidating women in the industry a “myth.” And when I wondered how hefigured this was the case, he said that people could simply call up a RonanFarrow or a Jodi Kantor or a Kim Masters and the retaliation would go away. Imarveled at this logic: helping to create a problem, then pointing to theresponse it had generated to claim the problem didn’t exist.In the earlier, less formal calls, there was a sense that Weinstein was stillliving in a parallel reality. He would acknowledge wrongdoing, then characterizehis actions by discussing a time he wrote an offensive comment in a girl’syearbook, or looked at a colleague the wrong way. Each time I reminded him thatwe were reporting multiple allegations of rape, he sounded startled. He’d beenoverwhelmed, he’d say, and hadn’t focused on the fact-checking messages indetail. And this seemed likely enough.Later, as the advisors joined the fray, the response that we ultimately includedin the story came to the fore: a blanket denial of all “non-consensual sex,”with little engagement on the specific allegations. This seemed to reflectWeinstein’s sincere view: he seldom suggested events hadn’t transpired, insteadinsisting that the interactions had been consensual and were being recast yearslater in a spirit of opportunism.He spent an inordinate amount of time attacking the character of women in thestory. “Harvey, I have a question,” Remnick interjected at one point, in allearnestness. “How does this relate to your behavior?” Weinstein seemedcomparatively unconcerned with disputing specific facts. Sometimes, he simplycouldn’t recall them. Once, he launched into a detailed discussion of anallegation not included in the story. He’d mixed up a name we’d given him and asimilar-sounding one from his own memories.Each time I brought up the audio from the police sting, Weinstein would bristle,outraged that a copy had survived. “You have a copy of a tape that was destroyedby the district attorney?” he asked, in disbelief. “The tape that wasdestroyed?” Later, spokespeople in Vance’s office would say they never agreed todestroy evidence. But Weinstein was convinced of it. Hofmeister later called andput the point on the record. Weinstein, she told me, was very concerned that adeal he’d reached was being breached. “There was an agreement between the policeand our—or the DA, I’m not sure who the agreement was with,” she said. “But itwas with our law firm that the tape that the police had would be destroyed.”Weinstein continued to emphasize what he took to be an arrangement with NBCNews. “NBC is pissed,” Weinstein said on several occasions. He wanted to knowwhat I was going to do with the footage I’d shot there. He said that the networkhad promised him it would explore legal remedies against me if I ever used thoserecordings. When these points came up on the group calls, Remnick listenedpatiently, then dismissed the arguments. “NBC is not a consideration here,” hesaid. “This business of NBC is just—you’re gonna find that’s a nonstarter.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]As the calls progressed, Weinstein’s temper flashed and flared. “Emily has anNDA,” he said of Nestor. “Be careful for her. We like her.” Dismayed handlersstepped in and began rapidly talking over him, with limited success. “She’s asweetie and a sweetheart,” he continued. “Doesn’t deserve it.” There werethreats to The New Yorker, as well: to sue, or to leak our fact-checking memo topreempt our story. “Careful,” Weinstein would say. “Guys, careful.”Once, when Hofmeister and the other handlers found themselves unable to stopWeinstein, they appeared to hang up. “We lost you,” Remnick said after theabrupt disconnection.“They didn’t want him to say that,” said Foley-Mendelssohn.“Yeah, that’s good lawyering right there,” Bertoni added, shaking his head indisbelief. “That’s what he’s paying them the big bucks for, to fucking hang upthe phone.”When we got them back on the line a few minutes later, Remnick said, “Sallie?Did a lawyer press the button?”“Are you on the phone?” Hofmeister replied.“I certainly am,” Remnick said.Where Weinstein offered specifics, the draft did evolve to reflect them. And bythe end, even as his anger arced, Weinstein sounded resigned. Several times, heconceded that we’d been fair—and that he “deserved” a lot of it.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]On October 10, Foley-Mendelssohn circulated the final edit of the story at 1:00a.m., and a final copyedit began at 5:00 a.m. By opening of business, the restof the team had signed off, Kim and McIntosh scrutinizing the last smalldetails. Michael Luo, the respected Times alumnus heading The New Yorker’swebsite, oversaw the final details of the web presentation. When I arrived, themagazine’s offices were quiet and flooded with sunlight, like a prism. As MonicaRacic, the magazine’s multimedia editor, stood at her desk, preparing to golive, Foley-Mendelssohn and a few others began to gather, and I moved to take apicture. The idea had been unsmiling documentation, not triumphalism, butRemnick broke it up all the same. “Not our style,” he said, and shooed peopleaway, and departed to get back to the grind.When it was done, I wandered over to one of the office’s windows and looked outat the Hudson. There was a numb feeling; Peggy Lee droning, “Is that all thereis to a fire?” I hoped the women would feel it was worth it; that they’d beenable to protect others. I wondered what would become of me. I had no arrangementwith The New Yorker beyond that first story, and no path forward in television.In the glass, I could make out the dark circles under my own eyes and, beyondthat, the world clear to the glittering horizon. A news chopper hovered over theHudson, watching.My phone chimed, chimed again. I hurried to the nearest computer, pulled up abrowser. From my email in-box and on Twitter and Facebook, the ping, ping, pingof alerts sounded. Message after message arrived, quickening to a constantscroll.Eventually, I’d hear from fellow journalists, including Kantor and Twohey, who’dlabored long and hard over their story. Several reporters said they’d fieldedefforts to intimidate them. One magazine writer who broke a significant storyabout Weinstein showed me the messages and played me the voicemails thateventually graduated to explicit threats of harm to him and his family. The FBIhad gotten involved. He’d run his report anyway.But mostly the messages came from stranger after stranger, saying they, too, hadstories. Some were from women and others from men. Some were searing accounts ofsexual violence and some focused on other species of crime or corruption. Allwhispered of abuses of power and of the systems—in government, media,law—deployed to cover them up.That first day, Melissa Lonner, the former Today show producer who’d met with mewhile she was working at Sirius XM, sent a message I barely noticed: “There aremore Harveys in your midst.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 43: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter043]CABAL [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter043]“Confident we can get new deal done,” Noah Oppenheim texted that day. I’d been aliability inside the building; now I’d be a liability if I left. He called lessthan an hour after the story ran. “I’m glad it worked out,” he said. “Good,good, good!” He continued: “As I’m sure you can imagine, Nightly, MS”—as in,MSNBC—“everyone is sort of calling and saying ‘Hey, how do we reach Ronan? Canwe book him to come on and talk about the article?’ So, I just wanted to seewhere your head was on that.” Oppenheim said they’d give me an NBC title againfor the appearances.“The only reason I would be hesitant about going on NBC is I don’t want to putanyone there or put you in an awkward position. Obviously Harvey made the storybehind the story and the history of it at NBC a big part of his thrust againstme,” I told Oppenheim. “If I’m asked about the history of it at NBC, I don’twant to be in a position where I have to be hiding anything.”Oppenheim and Kornblau were making the issue harder to avoid. By then, severalmedia reporters had called me, claiming that the two executives had beendissembling about the history of the story in background conversations.Stressed, I’d punted the calls to Raabe, The New Yorker’s head ofcommunications, and to Jonathan. While Oppenheim and I spoke, Jake Tapper, ofCNN, had tweeted, “Speaking of media complicity ask yourself why NBC reporterRonan Farrow wrote this for The New Yorker.” Soon, Tapper was on air reading aquote. “An NBC source told the Daily Beast, quote, ‘He brought NBC News earlyreporting on Weinstein that didn’t meet the standard to go forward with thestory. It was nowhere close to what ultimately ran. At that time, he didn’t haveone accuser willing to go on the record or identify themselves. The story hepublished is radically different than what he brought to NBC News.’” Then hefurrowed his brow and said, “That seems like a real lie to me.”When I mentioned not being able to lie if the matter arose on air, Oppenheimlaughed nervously. “I mean, look, unless—unless you’re gonna, like—I mean, itdoesn’t sound like you’re inclined to do it—unless you’re gonna bring up—”“No. No,” I replied. “My honest goal here, Noah, as it has been throughout thisprocess, is to not have anything overshadow the stories of these women.”Oppenheim asked if I’d get over to 30 Rock quickly to shoot a spot for NightlyNews. I sensed I was being sent to deodorize a public relations problem. But thewomen’s claims really did deserve exposure on NBC’s platforms. And the truthwas, I wanted my job back. I told myself that avoiding the story behind thestory wouldn’t be the same as lying about it.A few hours later, my phone pinged: “Ronan, it’s Matt Lauer. Let me be the 567thperson to say congratulations on an amazing piece!”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The arrangement with Oppenheim was a tightrope walk. On other networks, I dodgedquestions, redirecting the conversation toward the women. On NBC programs, Iappeared under shifting titles: contributor or correspondent, investigative ornot, the detritus of hasty resurrection. When I arrived that afternoon to recordthe Nightly News segment, colleagues approached, ashen-faced. A producer whooften worked the police beat, trembling with something like grief, said that hewould have loved the chance to help and that he couldn’t understand what hadhappened. A correspondent texted, “As a survivor of sexual abuse, I feel like weare working for a media cabal akin to the Vatican, willing to cover up sexcrimes.” These were some of the best journalists I knew, the people who had mademe proud to be associated with NBC News. They were fiercely committed to thenetwork’s ideals of truth and transparency. “People who cared about journalismin the building were very discomforted by all this,” a different member of theinvestigative unit later told me. “It’s taken a long time for things to healhere.”It felt strange, not fronting the package McHugh and I had labored over butbeing interviewed by another correspondent, assigned to cover it as news of theday. The spot included material Harris and Weiner had struck from my script,including the legion of employees saying they witnessed misconduct. “Newaccusations are rippling through Hollywood as a recording emerges of anencounter between Weinstein and one of his accusers during a police sting,”Lester Holt intoned on air that evening. “Here’s NBC’s Anne Thompson.” And this,too, was strange: “a recording emerges.” Who could say where it had been before?Not in Noah Oppenheim’s office for five months, surely.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Several hours later, in a greenroom where I’d once greeted guests on my show, Iwatched Rachel Maddow begin her program on a small screen in the corner. Fortwenty minutes, she recounted the recent history of high-profile sexual assaultand harassment stories, lingering on the media’s failures of responsibility. Shetraced the line from Cosby to the Fox News allegations and the conflagrationaround the Access Hollywood tape. “That tape came out a year ago this week,” shesaid pointedly.Coming to Weinstein, Maddow, like everyone else, made much of the recording. Shesat in front of a backdrop that read “I’m used to that” and questioned how itall stayed secret for so long. “These allegations were so widely known andapparently accepted,” she said. The public was “coming to terms with the factthat a large corporate conspiracy was involved in covering this all up.”I felt exhausted and conflicted. Oppenheim’s dangled promise to un-fire me hadactually worked. Despite it all, I still aspired to be an anchor and reporter atNBC News. And I was looking past this moment of attention, of TV hits andtweets, and wondering what I’d actually do next. But there was Maddow, in hermeticulous way, setting up our conversation, and pressing on the doubt I feltabout even being in this building.On set, Maddow sat mascaraed and black-jacketed. She leaned in, both empatheticand wolfish. “Obviously this was a long chase for you,” she said. “You wereworking at NBC News when you started working on this. You ended up publishing itwith The New Yorker—if you can speak to that, I’d love to hear about that.” Andwhen I diverted to other topics, she looked at me hard and said, “Ronan, I havea couple more questions for you about this. I was not supposed to keep you for asecond segment, but I’m overruling everybody.” After a commercial break, shereturned to the themes of complicity and cover-up, and the question: “Why didyou end up reporting this story for The New Yorker and not for NBC News?”I felt Maddow’s gaze, and the harsh lights overhead. For all the warning shotsshe’d given, I hadn’t planned an answer. “Look, you would have to ask NBC andNBC executives about the details of that story,” I said. “I will say that overmany years, many news organizations have circled this story and faced a greatdeal of pressure in doing so. And there are now reports emerging publicly aboutthe kinds of pressure that news organizations face in this.” I explained thatI’d been threatened with a lawsuit personally. That the Times had beenthreatened. That I couldn’t describe any threats others might have faced, butyou could rest assured there was pressure.“NBC says that, you know, you didn’t—that the story wasn’t publishable, that itwasn’t ready to go by the time you brought it to them,” she said, referring toOppenheim’s and Kornblau’s suggestions that I’d pitched the story, come upempty, then gone off to report it elsewhere of my own volition. Maddow pressedan index finger on her Lucite desk. Her real eyebrows arched up and, in thedesk, her reflected ones plunged down: a Cirque du Soleil of skepticism. “Butobviously it was ready to go by the time you got it into The New Yorker.”I’d been clear with Oppenheim that I’d avoid, but wouldn’t lie. “I walked intothe door at The New Yorker with an explosively reportable piece that should havebeen public earlier, and immediately, obviously, The New Yorker recognizedthat,” I said. “It is not accurate to say that it was not reportable. In fact,there were multiple determinations that it was reportable at NBC.”I could feel my promise of keeping the peace slipping away, and my future at thenetwork with it. Maddow gave me a sympathetic look. “I know parts of this story,in terms of the reporting side of it, is not the easiest stuff to talk about andI know you don’t want to make yourself the center of this story,” she said.“That is important,” I said. “These women came forward with incredibly braveallegations. They tore their guts out talking about this and re-traumatizedthemselves because they believed they could protect other women going forward.So, this should not be about me, or the wonderful, important work that JodiKantor did… ultimately, we are there in service of women doing something reallytough, and I hope people hear their voices and focus on that.”I walked off set and burst into tears."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 44: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter044]CHARGER [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter044]The moment she was off air, Maddow got her call. She paced up and down the set,phone pressed to her ear, Griffin’s raised voice audible even at a distance.Then Oppenheim was calling. “So, am I an ex-NBC-contributing—whatever you cameup with?” I joked.“I cannot account for Rachel Maddow’s behavior. And believe me—” Oppenheimbegan. “Look, it is what it is. Here’s what I would say. Unfortunately, it hasobviously set off a firestorm.”Oppenheim sounded nervous. He said that he was being told we had to release astatement saying more forcefully, on the record, that NBC never had the story.He wanted me to sign on to it.Quickly, we were back in the circular arguments from his office, thoughOppenheim had now gone from making the case for why the story shouldn’t run toarguing, in effect, that he hadn’t made that case in the first place.When I asked him if he talked to Weinstein, he said: “I never did!”“Noah, when you presented me with that article about Harvey working with WoodyAllen, you said, ‘Harvey says,’” I reminded him. And at this he groaned,revised, wailed instead: “Harvey Weinstein called me once!”The call stretched on for hours. Mark Kornblau conferenced in and pressed me tosign a Kafkaesque compromise statement that conceded the story had passed alegal and standards review but said it also failed to meet “our standards.” Myhead hurt. Kornblau, it turned out, had a track record of dissembling statementsabout scandals. In 2007, as then–presidential candidate John Edwards’sspokesperson, he spent months stamping out stories that Edwards had fathered achild with Rielle Hunter, a campaign videographer. Kornblau asked Edwards tosign an affidavit denying paternity. When Edwards declined, Hunter later wrotethat “it was the moment when Mark knew the truth.” But Mark Kornblau, whoremained on the campaign until its end a month later, continued to preside overpublic denials, evidently believing Edwards’s thin cover story. Later, whenEdwards was tried for violations of campaign finance law in the course ofcovering up the affair, prosecutors accused Kornblau of concealing the incidentin pretrial interviews. Kornblau said prosecutors just hadn’t asked the rightquestions. Edwards was later acquitted of one criminal count, and a mistrial wasdeclared on the others.At the time, I knew none of this. I still wanted to salvage my future with theexecutives. I told them I couldn’t join a false statement. But I promised themI’d avoid answering further questions like Maddow’s.At one point, my phone died, Oppenheim cut off mid-shout. I was still in thegreenroom at MSNBC. I borrowed a charger and plugged in. As I waited, aprominent on-air personality who hadn’t yet left the office sat with me andremarked casually:“Noah’s a sick fuck, and Andy’s a sick fuck, and they both need to go.”“You mean beyond this?” I asked.“There have been three things that I know of personally.”“The Access tape,” I said. “This…”“And something else. Involving talent here.”My eyes widened. But the phone was alive again, and Oppenheim was calling back.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Under the lights of studio 1A, Matt Lauer eyed me like a lit stick of TNT andoffered the latest reframing of the matter: “You’ve been working this story fora long time, both for NBC News and The New Yorker. I know it has been a long anddifficult process to get these actresses to be identified and go on the recordwith their allegations.” There had been no utopian collaborative effort “bothfor NBC News and The New Yorker.” Within the first days of shooting, we’d had awoman on the record. You can see, on the tape of the segment, my eyebrows dartup. Lauer seemed strange on set that day, restless. When I spoke about thecomplexity of workplace sexual misconduct and retaliation, he shifted in hisseat, then jumped in to read Hofmeister’s statement about Weinstein. As hemoved, a sheen of light slid across his navy blue, impeccably tailored suit.A few hours later, Oppenheim gathered the producers and reporters of theinvestigative unit to “clear the air” and allay “misconceptions.” When hereiterated the claim that the network simply never had the story, McHugh spokeup. “Forgive me, Noah,” he said. “But I have to disagree.” Oppenheim lookedstartled. The meeting turned contentious, the journalists asking one questionafter another. Why hadn’t the network just run the audio? If Oppenheim hadwanted more, why weren’t McHugh and I allowed to seek it? None of the answersseemed to satisfy. “I don’t understand what circumstance would exist as ajournalistic organization where—even if they didn’t believe you had it at thatmoment—they didn’t say, ‘We’re gonna give you more resources, we’re gonna doubledown,’” said one veteran journalist there that day. “It didn’t ever pass thelaugh test for me. And I don’t think it did to the rest of the group.”The next morning, McHugh got a call on his cell from Oppenheim’s assistant.“Noah would like to see you.” Oppenheim said he wanted to address the concernsMcHugh had referenced in front of—he said, with a note of distaste—the wholegroup. “Harvey Weinstein’s lawyers were calling us all through the seven monthsand never once did I say to anyone, ‘Don’t do it,’” Oppenheim said.“I was ordered to stop on the story,” McHugh said. “Ronan and I sensed that NBCwas going down a direction where they were not gonna publish this story.”“I’m the one who launched the fucking story!” Oppenheim said, losing his cool,getting angry. “I’m now being accused widely,” he said, “of being somehowcomplicit in covering up for a rapist. Okay! As the only person here who gaveRonan a job after MSNBC canceled his show, as the person whose idea it was forthe story—”“I’m not accusing you,” McHugh said calmly.But Oppenheim was injured now. That David Remnick had answered plainly thequestions he was fielding seemed particularly galling. (“From the moment hewalked in the doors here, you were determined to get this in print?” a CBSreporter had asked Remnick. “You’re damn right,” he’d replied.) “David Remnickspiked the Ken Auletta story!” Oppenheim shouted at McHugh. “He just did nothingfor the last sixteen years until Ronan walked in his door. It’s a little hard tostomach the self-righteousness from somebody like that who killed their story,didn’t do anything for years and years and years, and is now claiming, ‘I’m justa big hero here because I let Ronan continue reporting.’” But Remnick had let mecontinue reporting. And Oppenheim hadn’t. The meeting was “crazy,” McHugh wouldreflect later. It seemed clear to him that Oppenheim wanted someone on theinside who’d sign on to the dissembling. He weighed up the stakes. This was hisboss’s boss cursing at him. McHugh didn’t have the platform or profile I did.The network’s power to quietly end his ability to make a living was greater, thelikelihood of anyone caring smaller. McHugh had his four girls to worry about,and his contract was up soon.He left the meeting feeling acutely aware that his future was on the line, andwondering how long he could resist these entreaties from the top.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The story left a blast radius, and the NBC executives weren’t the only onescaught in it. Hillary Clinton had said nothing over the weekend between thestories from the Times and The New Yorker, declining inquiries from reporterswhile other politicians issued moralizing statements. Tina Brown, who had editedTalk magazine for Weinstein, began telling the press that she’d warned Clintonteam members about Weinstein’s reputation during the 2008 campaign. The writerand actor Lena Dunham disclosed how, during the 2016 campaign, she’d toldClinton’s staff that the campaign’s reliance on Weinstein as a fund-raiser andevent organizer was a liability. “I just want to let you know that Harvey’s arapist and this is going to come out at some point,” she recalled telling acommunications staffer, one of several she said she warned.After five days, Clinton issued a statement saying she was “shocked andappalled.” I went back to Nick Merrill, her representative who had expressedanxieties about my reporting, and told him that my foreign policy book was aboutto feature interviews with every other living secretary of state and my bestefforts to explain why Clinton had withdrawn. A call with her was hastilyscheduled after all.Woody Allen, who had expressed his sympathies to Weinstein on the phone thepreceding month, expressed sympathies again in public. “No-one ever came to meor told me horror stories with any real seriousness,” he said. “And theywouldn’t, because you are not interested in it. You are interested in makingyour movie.” And then: “The whole Harvey Weinstein thing is very sad foreverybody involved. Tragic for the poor women that were involved, sad for Harveythat [his] life is so messed up.” Later, in response to criticism about thecomments, he said he’d meant Weinstein was “a sad, sick man.” In any case, heemphasized, the important thing was “to avoid ‘a witch hunt atmosphere’ where‘every guy in an office who winks at a woman is suddenly having to call a lawyerto defend himself.’”Streep, who had been so surprised to learn of the allegations when I spoke withher, said as much again. She was fielding criticism, much of it unfair. Aright-wing guerrilla artist posted around Los Angeles an image of Streep andWeinstein huddled together, with a slash of red paint over Streep’s eyes bearingthe words “She knew.” Streep released a statement through her publicist.(Because Hollywood values economy of characters, this was also Woody Allen’spublicist, Leslee Dart, who had overseen his periodic efforts to discredit mysister.) “One thing can be clarified. Not everybody knew,” Streep’s statementsaid. “And if everybody knew, I don’t believe that all the investigativereporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected fordecades to write about it.” I believed that Streep didn’t know. But her optimismwas misplaced: the media had tried, but it had also known, and neglected, somuch."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 45: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter045]NIGHTGOWN [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter045]The women in the story were reacting too. Some were pained, others ecstatic. Alldescribed feeling a weight lifted. McGowan, after her months of ups and downs,thanked me. “You came in with a glorious flaming sword. So fucking well done,”she wrote. “You did a huge service to us all. And you were BRAVE.” McGowan saidthat she’d been staring down Weinstein’s mounting offensive and her ownspiraling legal fees. “I know you’re mad at me and I had to go hard,” sheexplained. “Behind the scenes Harder and Bloom were terrorizing me.”It had been a lonely time for McGowan. She’d let few people in, except for hernew friend “Diana Filip”—“Anna” in the recent meeting with Weinstein. The day mystory broke, she checked in with McGowan:Hi Love,I’ ve been thinking about you a lot these past few days. So crazy, everythingthat’s going on!How are you feeling? It must be a relief and a lot of stress at the same time.you must be getting a lot of messages, I hope that all of them are supportive.Anyway, just wanted to tell you how brave I think you are. I’m so proud of you.I will send an email soon linking you with Paul, so that the two of you canarrange a follow up meeting to discuss the business.XxBy then, multiple sources had described contact from individuals they foundsuspicious. Zelda Perkins, the assistant involved in the London settlements,finally began responding to me, first to insist that she was legally barred fromspeaking about her time with Weinstein, then, over time, to share the full storyof the London settlements. She said she’d also received what felt like not quitea normal reporting inquiry from a writer for the Guardian named Seth Freedman.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Annabella Sciorra sent word the day the story broke, too: “You did an incrediblejob of not only outing him but also conveying the pain that all of those womenwent through and continue to go through,” she wrote. When I called her back, shebegan to explain that she was one of the women who continued to experience pain.During our first call, she’d stared out of her living room window at the EastRiver, and struggled to tell her story. “I was like, ‘This is the moment you’vebeen waiting for your whole life…’” Then, panic had set in. “I was shaking,” sherecalled. “And I just wanted to get off the phone.”The truth, she said, was that she had been struggling to speak about Weinsteinfor more than twenty years. She lived in terror of him; she still slept with abaseball bat by her bed. Weinstein, she said, had violently raped her and, overthe next several years, sexually harassed her repeatedly.In the early nineties, after Sciorra starred in The Night We Never Met, whichWeinstein produced, she said that she became ensconced in “this circle ofMiramax.” There were so many screenings and events and dinners that it was hardto imagine life outside of the Weinstein ecosystem. At one dinner, in New York,she recalled, “Harvey was there, and I got up to leave. And Harvey said, ‘Oh,I’ll drop you off.’ Harvey had dropped me off before, so I didn’t really expectanything out of the ordinary—I expected just to be dropped off.” In the car,Weinstein said goodbye to Sciorra, and she went upstairs to her apartment. Shewas alone and getting ready for bed a few minutes later when she heard a knockon the door. “It wasn’t that late,” she said. “Like, it wasn’t the middle of thenight, so I opened the door a crack to see who it was. And he pushed the dooropen.” Sciorra paused. The story seemed almost physically impossible for her totell. Weinstein “walked in like it was his apartment, like he owned the place,and started unbuttoning his shirt. So it was very clear where he thought thiswas going to go. And I was in a nightgown. I didn’t have much on.” He circledthe apartment; to Sciorra, it appeared that he was checking whether anyone elsewas there.Sciorra told me that listening to Gutierrez’s recording from the sting operation“really triggered me.” She remembered Weinstein employing the same tactics as hecornered her, backing her into her bedroom. “Come here, come on, cut it out,what are you doing, come here,” she remembered him saying. She tried to beassertive. “This is not happening,” she told him. “You’ve got to go. You have toleave. Get out of my apartment.”“He shoved me onto the bed, and he got on top of me.” Sciorra struggled. “Ikicked and I yelled,” she said, but Weinstein locked her arms over her head withone hand and forced sexual intercourse on her. “When he was done, he ejaculatedon my leg, and on my nightgown.” It was a family heirloom, handed down fromrelatives in Italy and embroidered in white cotton. “He said, ‘I have impeccabletiming,’ and then he said, ‘This is for you.’” Sciorra stopped, overcome,hyperventilating. “And then he attempted to perform oral sex on me. And Istruggled, but I had very little strength left in me.” Sciorra said that herbody started to shake violently. “I think, in a way, that’s what made him leave,because it looked like I was having a seizure or something.”The renderings of these stories that were ultimately published in The New Yorkerwere precise and legalistic. They made no attempt at communicating the true,bleak ugliness of listening to a recollection of violent rape like Sciorra’s.Her voice caught. The memory erupted in ragged sobs. You heard Annabella Sciorastruggle to tell her story once, and it stayed inside you forever.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]In the weeks and months that followed the alleged attack, Sciorra didn’t tellanyone about it. She never spoke to the police. “Like most of these women, I wasso ashamed of what happened,” she said. “And I fought. I fought. But still I waslike, Why did I open that door? Who opens the door at that time of night? I wasdefinitely embarrassed by it. I felt disgusting. I felt like I had fucked up.”She grew depressed and lost weight. Her father, unaware of the attack butconcerned for her well-being, urged her to seek help, and she did see atherapist, but, she said, “I don’t even think I told the therapist. It’spathetic.”Sciorra, like so many others, suspected that Weinstein had retaliated. She saidthat she felt the impact on her livelihood almost immediately. “From 1992, Ididn’t work again until 1995,” she said. “I just kept getting this pushback of‘we heard you were difficult; we heard this or that.’ I think that that was theHarvey machine.” The actress Rosie Perez, a friend who was among the first todiscuss Sciorra’s allegations with her, told me, “She was riding high, and thenshe started acting weird and getting reclusive. It made no sense. Why did thiswoman, who was so talented, and riding so high, doing hit after hit, then all ofa sudden fall off the map? It hurts me as a fellow actress to see her career notflourish the way it should have.”Several years later, Sciorra did begin working again, and Weinstein againpursued her with unwanted sexual advances. In 1995, she was in London shootingThe Innocent Sleep, which Weinstein did not produce. According to Sciorra,Weinstein began leaving her messages, demanding that she call him or that theymeet at his hotel. She didn’t know how he’d found her. One night, he showed upat her room and began pounding on the door, she said. “For nights after, Icouldn’t sleep. I piled furniture in front of the door, like in the movies.”Two years later, Sciorra appeared in the crime drama Cop Land as Liz Randone,the wife of a corrupt police officer. She said that she auditioned for the partwithout realizing at first that it was a Miramax film, and she learned thatWeinstein’s company was involved only when she began contract negotiations. InMay 1997, shortly before the film’s release, Sciorra went to the Cannes FilmFestival. When she checked into the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc, in Antibes, a Miramaxassociate told her that Weinstein’s room would be next to hers. “My heart justsank,” Sciorra recalled. Early one morning, while she was still asleep, therewas a knock on the door. Groggy, and thinking she must have forgotten about anearly hair-and-makeup call, she opened the door. “There’s Harvey in hisunderwear, holding a bottle of baby oil in one hand and a tape, a movie, in theother,” she recalled. “And it was horrific, because I’d been there before.”Sciorra said that she ran from Weinstein. “He was closing in really quickly, andI pressed all the call buttons for valet service and room service. I keptpressing all of them until someone showed up.” Weinstein retreated, she said,when hotel staff arrived.Over time, Sciorra opened up to a small number of people. Perez said that sheheard from an acquaintance about Weinstein’s behavior at the hotel in London andquestioned Sciorra about what happened. Sciorra told Perez about the attack inher apartment, and Perez, who was sexually assaulted by a relative during herchildhood, began crying. “I said, ‘Oh, Annabella, you’ve gotta go to thepolice.’ She said, ‘I can’t go to the police. He’s destroying my career.’”Perez said that she urged Sciorra to speak by describing her own experience ofgoing public about her assault. “I told her, ‘I used to tread water for years.It’s fucking exhausting, and maybe speaking out, that’s your lifeboat. Grab onand get out,’” Perez recalled. “I said, ‘Honey, the water never goes away. But,after I went public, it became a puddle and I built a bridge over it, and oneday you’re gonna get there, too.’”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]When Sciorra decided to go on the record, I told Remnick that I had more. Heassigned David Rohde, a veteran war reporter for Reuters and the Times, as anadditional editor. Rohde, who had once been kidnapped by the Taliban, had anangelic face that seemed incapable of arranging itself into expressions ofmalice or deception.That October, he and Foley-Mendelssohn oversaw what became a story about thecomplex struggle each of the women had faced over whether to speak. We includedSciorra’s account, and that of the actress Daryl Hannah, who told me Weinsteinhad sexually harassed her, too. Hannah said that, during the Cannes FilmFestival in the early 2000s, Weinstein had relentlessly pounded on herhotel-room door until she slipped out via an exterior door and spent the nightin her makeup artist’s room. The night after, he’d tried again, and she’d had tobarricade her hotel door with furniture to keep Weinstein out. Several yearslater, while she was in Rome for the premiere of Kill Bill: Volume 2, whichMiramax distributed, he simply showed up in her room. “He had a key,” Hannahtold me. “He came through the living room and into the bedroom. He just burst inlike a raging bull. And I know with every fiber of my being that if my malemakeup artist was not in that room, things would not have gone well. It wasscary.” Weinstein, appearing to cover for the bizarre intrusion, demanded thatshe go downstairs for a party. But when she got there, the room was empty; itwas just Weinstein, asking, “Are your tits real?” and then asking to feel them.“I said, ‘No, you can’t!’ And then he said, ‘At least flash me, then.’ And Isaid, ‘Fuck off, Harvey.’” The next morning, the Miramax private plane leftwithout Hannah on it.Sciorra and Hannah both talked about the forces that keep women quiet. Hannahsaid she’d told anyone who would listen from the get-go. “And it didn’t matter,”she told me. “I think that it doesn’t matter if you’re a well-known actress, itdoesn’t matter if you’re twenty or if you’re forty, it doesn’t matter if youreport or if you don’t, because we are not believed. We are more than notbelieved—we are berated and criticized and blamed.”Sciorra, on the other hand, had been afraid to talk for all the reasonssurvivors of rape so often are: the bludgeoning psychic force of trauma; thefear of retaliation and stigma. “Now when I go to a restaurant or to an event,people are going to know that this happened to me,” Sciorra said. “They’re gonnalook at me and they’re gonna know. I’m an intensely private person, and this isthe most unprivate thing you can do.”But there had been something separate and more specific behind her silence.Weinstein’s vice grip on the media had made it hard to know whom to trust. “I’veknown now for a long time how powerful Harvey became, and how he owned a lot ofjournalists and gossip columnists,” she said.And she couldn’t prove it, but she was convinced Weinstein was spying on her,keeping tabs, sending intermediaries with concealed motives. She conceded itsounded crazy. “I was afraid of you, because I thought it was Harvey checking upon me,” she said. “As I was talking to you, I got scared that it wasn’t reallyyou.” When I asked her if anyone suspicious had contacted her, she strained toremember. There had been a call, she said, from a British reporter that hadunsettled her. “It struck me as BS,” she told me. “And it scared me that Harveywas testing to see if I would talk.” She fished through her texts. There he was,in August, not long after I’d heard from him: “Hi Ms. Sciorra it’s Seth, thejournalist in London…. Might you have time for a very quick call to help withour piece? No more than ten minutes, and it’d be really useful for ourresearch…”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 46: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter046]PRETEXTING [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter046]Seth Freedman cut a colorful profile. He was a small man with wild eyes, a thickbeard, and hair that seemed perpetually askew. He’d been a London stockbroker,then moved to Israel and served in a combat unit in the Israel DefenseForces—IDF—for fifteen months in the 2000s. Later, he turned whistle-blower,taking to the pages of the Guardian to expose his financial firm’s manipulationof wholesale gas prices, eventually getting fired for it. His articles had arambling, jocular quality and were laced with frank references to a drug habit.In 2013, he’d written a novel called Dead Cat Bounce, about a coked-outLondon-based Jewish finance guy who runs away to join the IDF and gets swept upin a world of espionage and crime, all under the guise of being a writer for theGuardian. Freedman wrote like a gangster in a Guy Ritchie movie talks: “Theperfect mojito is a line of coke. See what I’m saying? Rum, lime, sugar,mint—yeah, yeah, yeah, but trust me, it’s the poor man’s Charlie. The scaredman’s snow. The straight man’s chang.”In late October 2017, after the conversation with Sciorra, I followed up onFreedman’s call, saying I wanted to talk. I told him it was time-sensitive. Atumble of WhatsApp messages came back. “Massive congratulations on yourreporting,” he said. “Have been following closely.” He said he’d been workingwith an English paper to get some of the stories out. Later, he’d explain how hepassed recordings he’d made of his conversations with McGowan and anotherWeinstein accuser to the Guardian’s Sunday publication, the Observer, and how itpublished articles based on the interviews. The articles made no mention ofFreedman, and talked around who conducted the interviews, and why.Freedman professed to have shared the recordings out of a sincere desire to helpexpose the truth. And he offered to help with my reporting too. Quickly, he senta screenshot of a document entitled “List of targets.” It was a portion of alist of nearly a hundred names: former Weinstein employees, unfriendlyjournalists, and, most of all, women with allegations. Rose McGowan. ZeldaPerkins. Annabella Sciorra. Many of the sources in my reporting were on it,including several who had expressed uneasy suspicions that they were beingwatched or followed. Priority targets were in red. It was the same list Lubelland Doyle Chambers had helped assemble. In some cases, it was annotated withtheir updates on conversations with targeted individuals.A few hours after we began exchanging messages, I was on the phone withFreedman. At first, he repeated his story about having only journalisticinterest in the matter. “I got tipped off in about November last year thatsomething was gonna happen, and people were looking into a story about HarveyWeinstein,” he said. “At the time, I wanted to just write a piece aboutHollywood, about what life was like there.”But over the course of the conversation, more fine details emerged about the“people” who were “looking into” Weinstein’s accusers. First he referred to thisshadowy group as “them.” “I kind of knew them already, but in an extremelydifferent context,” he said. Then it was “we.” “Initially, we thought this was…the normal kind of business dispute you have with Oligarch 1 against Oligarch 2,the equivalent in Hollywood,” he said. The earliest dossiers he receivedscrutinized Weinstein’s business rivals, including board members at amfAR. Butas the focus turned to McGowan, and Perkins, and Dix, he said, he began to growuncomfortable with his involvement. “It turned out that it was actually aboutsexual assault. We pulled back and we said there’s no way we’re getting involvedwith this. How do we extricate ourselves? Because he’s hired us.”I struggled to make sense of who Seth Freedman was working with on Weinstein’sbehalf. “Are we talking about private investigators working for him or otherjournalists?” I asked.“Yeah, the first, yeah,” he said cautiously. “I was in the Israeli army,” hecontinued. “I know a lot of people involved in Israeli intelligence. That shouldbe enough to give you a guide to who they are without me telling you who theyare.”I tried one more time. “Can you name any of the individuals in this group or thename of the group?”Finally, he said, “They’re called Black Cube.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]For you or me, the term “private detective” might conjure images ofhard-drinking ex-cops working out of rundown offices. But for moneyedcorporations and individuals, the profession has long offered services that lookvery different. Back in the ’70s, a former prosecutor named Jules Kroll foundedhis eponymous firm, catering to law firms and banks, and staffed by former cops,FBI agents, and forensic accountants. The formula, and a generation of copycats,flourished. In the 2000s, Israel became a hotbed for such firms. The country’smandatory military service, and the legendary secrecy and accomplishment of itsintelligence agency, Mossad, created a ready pipeline of trained operatives. TheIsraeli firms began emphasizing less conventional forms of corporate espionage,including “pretexting”: using operatives with false identities.Black Cube perfected the formula. It was founded in 2010 by Dan Zorella and Dr.Avi Yanus, who had been on the emails with Weinstein’s lawyers. Zorella andYanus were both veterans of a secret Israeli intelligence unit. From thebeginning, Black Cube had close connections to Israel’s military andintelligence leadership. Meir Dagan, the legendary former director of Mossad,sat on the company’s advisory board until his death, in 2016. Dagan once pitchedBlack Cube’s services to a tycoon by saying: I can find a personal Mossad foryou.Black Cube’s workforce grew to more than a hundred operatives, speaking thirtylanguages. It opened offices in London and Paris and eventually moved itsheadquarters to a massive space in a gleaming tower in central Tel Aviv, behinda jet-black unmarked door. Inside, there were more unmarked doors, fingerprintreaders sealing many of them. In the company’s reception area, just abouteverything fit a black cube motif, from the plush furnishings to the art on thewalls. In other rooms, agents took pretexting to new extremes. A single deskmight have cubby holes containing twenty different cell phones, each tied to adifferent number and fictional persona. Everyone submitted to routine polygraphsto ensure they weren’t leaking to the press. Even the janitors got tested.The line between Black Cube and Israel’s actual intelligence apparatus could befine. The private agency was “the exclusive supplier to major organizations andgovernment ministries,” one court document revealed. So it was unsurprising thatEhud Barak, the former prime minister, had recommended Black Cube to Weinstein.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]I blanketed Tel Aviv with calls and emails, and soon, a firm that prided itselfon silence was beginning to whisper, up to its very highest levels. There was aformal, bland denial, orchestrated by a freelance Tel Aviv flack named EidoMinkovsky, who flirted and flattered his way through calls. “My wife’s seen yourpictures,” he said. “There’s no way she’s gonna come to New York. She’s notallowed to. I confiscated her visa.”“You’re a sweet talker. I respect that,” I said.“Yeah, that’s my game.”And then there was a series of more revealing calls that I took alongside Rohde,the editor, huddled in his office early each morning to account for the timedifference. These were with two men close to the Black Cube operation, who spokeon condition of anonymity. At first, their party line was denial. They said theagency had only done internet research for Weinstein, and that its operativeshad never contacted women with allegations or reporters. “We never approachedany of these,” said the deeper of the two Israeli-accented voices, belonging tothe more senior of the sources. “I also made sure with my team here, any ofthese you wrote here: Annabella Sciorra, Sophie Dix, Rose McGowan…” And, when Iraised Ben Wallace’s and my suspicions that we’d been targeted: “We don’tgenerally work on journalists as a target.” They “swore” it, said the morejunior man close to the operation, who had a higher, lighter voice. “We’reTalmud Jews!” he continued. “We don’t swear for nothing!” The calls were bothominous and entertaining.They promised to send documents from within the operation that would dispel anyclaims that Black Cube had followed accusers or reporters. “I will send you thedocuments today,” the lower voice said. “We’ll use a onetime email or one of ourservers, we’ll see.”Thirty minutes after we hung up, a message arrived from the encrypted emailservice ProtonMail, with documents attached. Another message followed a fewhours later, from a different email service, Zmail, with more documents. Smartto disperse them across multiple accounts, I thought. “Hello mutual friend,”read the first email. “Attached you’ll find new information concerning the HW&BCaffair. Best, cryptoadmin.”The ProtonMail account it came from bore the name “Sleeper1973.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 47: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter047]RUNNING [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter047]Attached to that email was a complete record of Black Cube’s work for Weinstein.There was the first contract, signed October 28, 2016, and several others thatfollowed, including a July 11, 2017, revision after the squabble over invoices.That last arrangement promised services through November:The primary objectives of the project are:a) Provide intelligence which will help the Client’s efforts to completely stopthe publication of a new negative article in a leading NY newspaper (hereinafter“the Article”);b) Obtain additional content of a book which currently being written andincludes harmful negative information on and about the Client (hereinafter “theBook”).Black Cube promised “a dedicated team of expert intelligence officers that willoperate in the USA and any other necessary country,” including a projectmanager, intelligence analysts, linguists, and “Avatar Operators” specificallyhired to create fake identities on social media, as well as “operations expertswith extensive experience in social engineering.” The agency agreed to hire “aninvestigative journalist, as per the Client request,” who would be required toconduct ten interviews a month for four months and be paid $40,000. The agencywould “promptly report to the Client the results of such interviews by theJournalist.”Black Cube also promised to provide “a full time agent by the name of ‘Anna’(hereinafter ‘the Agent’), who will be based in New York and Los Angeles as perthe Client’s instructions and who will be available full time to assist theClient and his attorneys for the next four months.”The invoices attached were eye-popping: fees that might have totaled up to $1.3million. The contracts were signed by Dr. Avi Yanus, the Black Cube director,and by Boies Schiller. This was an astonishment. Boies’s law firm representedthe New York Times. But here was the esteemed lawyer’s signature, in genteelblue-inked cursive, on a contract to kill the paper’s reporting and obtainMcGowan’s book.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Black Cube stressed that its tactics were vetted by attorneys around the worldand that it kept to the letter of the law. But I was soon hearing from sourcesin the private intelligence world that the agency had a reputation for floutingrules. In 2016, two Black Cube operatives were jailed in Romania forintimidating a prosecutor and hacking her emails. They were later convicted,receiving suspended sentences. “Privacy laws, data laws,” one person directlyinvolved with Black Cube’s operations told me. “It’s impossible to do what theydo without breaking the law.” The head of a competing Israeli privateintelligence firm who’d had dealings with Black Cube told me, “More than fiftypercent of what they do is illegal.” I asked him what to do if I suspected I wasbeing followed, and he said, “Just start running.”As our conversations with the Israelis grew tense, I spent a few nights at myborrowed desks at The New Yorker rather than move around on the streets afterdark.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Within hours of the contracts coming in, I was on the phone with David Boies,the beginning of what would sprawl into days of conversation. At first, hewasn’t sure he wanted to go on the record. He said he was busy with his pro bonowork, including negotiating to get a young American out of jail in Venezuela.And he was concerned that he might be misinterpreted. “As the bad guy says inone of the Mission Impossible films, it’s complicated,” he wrote in one email. Ipuzzled over the choice of quotes. It was from a scene in the third film in thatseries. Billy Crudup, thus far made out to be a good guy, sits down in front ofa bloodied Tom Cruise, tied to a chair in the way heroes have to be at thispoint in the third act, and gives a similarly obligatory speech about how he wasworking for the bad guy. “It’s complicated,” says Crudup. He’s concerned aboutbeing found out. “Did anyone else see it?” he asks of evidence tying him to thevillain, chewing scenery like he’s read the script and knows it’s his lastscene.Boies eventually went on the record. “We should not have been contracting withand paying investigators that we did not select and direct,” he told me. “At thetime, it seemed a reasonable accommodation for a client, but it was not thoughtthrough, and that was my mistake. It was a mistake at the time.” Boies concededthat efforts to profile and undermine reporters were problematic. “In general, Idon’t think it’s appropriate to try to pressure reporters,” he said. “If thatdid happen here, it would not have been appropriate.” And he edged towardsomething like personal regret. “In retrospect, I knew enough in 2015 that Ibelieve I should have been on notice of a problem, and done something about it,”he added, referring to the time frame when Nestor’s and Gutierrez’s allegationssurfaced. “I don’t know what, if anything, happened after 2015, but to theextent it did, I think I have some responsibility. I also think that if peoplehad taken action earlier it would have been better for Mr. Weinstein.”It is to Boies’s credit that he unhesitatingly copped to everything, includingthe agent the contract called Anna and the reporter-for-hire, whom he identifiedas Freedman, the former Guardian writer. When I sent him the signed contractswith Black Cube, he wrote back simply, “Both are my signatures.” The bestcharacters know when it’s time for a confessional speech.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]In Rohde’s office the next morning, we were back on the phone with the two menclose to the Black Cube operation. I thanked them for sending the documents.They sounded cheerful, confident that what they’d sent would exonerate them ofany claims that they’d relied on intrusive human surveillance on Weinstein’sbehalf. “We did not approach any of these women undercover,” the deeper of thetwo voices said again. “We did not approach any of these journalistsundercover.”When I began asking questions about the contract that alluded to those verytactics, they sounded confused. “We never drafted. I can one hundred percenttell you that we never drafted,” the higher voice chimed in.Rohde and I exchanged a puzzled glance. “I’m looking at it. It’s on Black Cube’sstationery, it’s signed by Avi,” I said. “ I’m referring to a document you guyssent me.”“When you say ‘we guys,’ what do you mean by ‘we guys?’” said the deeper voice,cautious, worried.“This was in the binder of documents that you sent to me yesterday. Not thesecond dump from Zmail, but the very first one, from the Sleeper email,” I said.A pin-drop silence.“We did not send you any burner email yesterday,” the deeper voice replied. “Theonly thing we sent you yesterday was from Zmail.”Realization prickled my skin. The men had promised a Black Cube document dumpfrom a discreet account. What was the likelihood that another source wouldintercede with a conflicting and more devastating leak at the exact same time?But two distinct leaks seemed the only possibility. I’d stumbled into a civilwar among spies.I got off the subject of the source of the documents in a hurry, told them thatwe’d already authenticated them with Boies and others. “They are genuine,” Isaid. There was a flash of panic in the deeper voice. “I… I don’t know who sentthat, but we will definitely investigate.” Then, collecting himself, he added:“We should do this friendly, I would say.” I wondered what the alternativelooked like.I fired off an email to the mystery address quickly. “Can you give anyinformation that would help authenticate these documents? Some parties involvedare denying several pieces of this.” A response, immediately: “I’m not surprisedthey denied it, but it is all true. they were trying to get Rose’s book, via agirl named ‘Ana’… a HUMINT agent.”Another set of files was attached: a wide-ranging history of correspondence andancillary documents underpinning and surrounding the contracts. Over time, thesewould check out, too.I leaned back, rubbed a palm over my mouth, thinking.Who are you, Sleeper?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 48: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter048]GASLIGHT [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter048]“We need to find out who he is,” Rohde, and just about everyone else at The NewYorker, pressed. We turned over the question. “Sleeper1973 is possibly a WoodyAllen reference,” I wrote, referring to the film of the same name released thatyear. “Which is certainly cheeky.” Someone with a sense of humor, then.But Sleeper rebuffed my every plea for identifying information, to get on anencrypted call, to meet in person. “I can understand your editors’ concernalthough I’m afraid to reveal my identity. Every online method can be monitoredthese days… its hard for me to trust it wont come back at me,” Sleeper wrote.“I’m sure you know NSO so I’m not interested in taking unnecessary risks.” NSOGroup was an Israeli cyber intelligence firm, famed for its Pegasus software,which could take control of a cell phone and strip-mine it for data. It had beenused to target dissidents and journalists around the world.But Sleeper kept sending information from the encrypted email address, and italways checked out. After McGowan told me she’d spent time with only a fewtrusted contacts in recent months and couldn’t recall anyone who might have beenAnna, the undercover operative, I asked Sleeper for leads. Anotherlightning-quick response: “Regarding Anna, her genuine name is Stella Pen. I’veattached pictures as well. She allegedly got 125 pages of Rose’s book (asappears on BC’s agreement with Boies), and discussed the findings with HWhimself.”Attached were three photos of a statuesque blonde with a prominent nose and highcheekbones.I was in a taxi, the West Side Highway slipping by outside. I texted the photosto McGowan and Ben Wallace.“Oh my God,” McGowan wrote back. “Reuben Capital. Diana Filip. No fucking way.”Wallace remembered her immediately too. “Yes,” he wrote back. “Who is she?”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Black Cube’s work was designed never to be discovered. But, once in a while, anoperative would leave too many prints. In the spring of 2017—as the Trumpadministration and its supporters worked to dismantle the 2015 Iran nucleardeal—a string of peculiar inquiries reached prominent defenders of the deal. Awoman identifying herself as Adriana Gavrilo, of Reuben Capital Partners,emailed Rebecca Kahl, a former program officer at the National DemocraticInstitute and the wife of Obama administration foreign policy advisor ColinKahl. Gavrilo told Kahl that she was launching an initiative on education andrepeatedly asked to meet to discuss the school that Kahl’s daughter attended.Worried that she was “strangely a target of some sort,” Kahl stopped responding.A few weeks later, a woman named Eva Novak, of a London-based film companycalled Shell Productions, emailed Ann Norris, a former State Department officialand the wife of Ben Rhodes, another Obama foreign policy advisor. Novak wantedNorris to consult on a movie that she described as “All the President’s Menmeets The West Wing,” telling the stories of government officials during timesof geopolitical crisis, including “nuclear negotiations with a hostile nation.”Finding Novak’s request “bizarre,” Norris decided not to write back at all.Later, Freedman would leak again, helping me assemble the documents underlyingthe operation: Black Cube profiles of the Obama administration officials,ferreting out damaging information, detailing bogus claims that they worked withIran lobbyists, or were getting kickbacks, and a rumor that one of them had anaffair.There were other examples. During the summer of 2017, a woman who identifiedherself as Diana Ilic, a London-based consultant to a European software mogul,began calling and meeting with critics of AmTrust Financial Services Inc.,pressing them to make statements about their work that could be used againstthem. Not long after, Maja Lazarov of Caesar & Co., a London-based recruitmentagency, began doing the same with employees of West Face Capital, a Canadianasset management firm.Social media accounts tied to these names, and photos taken during the meetings,showed a familiar face, with high cheekbones framed by long blond hair.The marks were left with the same question:Anna, Adriana, Eva, Diana, Maja.Who are you?[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Stella Penn Pechanac was born between two worlds and belonged to none. “I was aBosnian Muslim, and my husband was a Serbian Orthodox,” her mother later said.“And what was our little Steliza?” In childhood photos, the girl was not yetblond but dark: dark hair, dark eyes. She was raised in the faded sprawl ofSarajevo, amid beat-up cars and dilapidated tower blocks. That was before thingsgot bad.Pechanac watched it all turn to ash and blood. War began, Serbian Orthodoxagainst Bosnian Muslim. Sarajevo was roadblocked and cordoned according to sect.At best, during the war, there was the grind of poverty and near starvation.When nothing else could be found, her mother made grass soup. Pechanac wassmart, but there were few opportunities for education. At worst, it was achildhood like Guernica. Sharpshooters on rooftops made the streets a deathtrap. For half a year, the family moved into a bare, closet-sized basement room.When the first bombs fell, Pechanac’s parents gathered up what wounded theycould, and shared the room and the thin mattress in it. “One woman died on it,”Pechanac would later recall with a shrug. After the bombing, the entryway oftheir rundown building flooded with blood. “There were water hoses we used toclean with, and they simply washed all the blood out the door. I remember, sevenyears old.”About a decade before the Weinstein affair, when Pechanac was in her earlytwenties, she and her mother had gone back to Sarajevo to appear in adocumentary about the war and their family’s flight from it. Her mother weptopenly, walking the streets and recalling the bloodshed. Pechanac seemed areluctant participant. She hovered at the margin of shots, chewing gum orsmoking, casting petulant glances at the camera.Eventually, one of the filmmakers cornered the impassive young woman at theentrance to a crumbling building and asked what it was like to relive suchpainful memories. Another shrug. “It makes me mad that she had to go throughthis,” she said, referring to her mother. “But personally, I haven’t feltanything for a long time.”During World War II, Pechanac’s grandmother had hidden and protected Jews. TheState of Israel bestowed upon her the Righteous Among the Nations honorific, anovelty for a Muslim woman. As Sarajevo burned, a Jewish family returned thefavor and helped to exfiltrate the Pechanacs. They settled in Jerusalem andconverted from their Muslim faith to Judaism. Young Stella Pechanac adapted to anew identity and cultural context. “She doesn’t feel inside patriotic like thepeople born in Israel,” said one person who knew her well. “Always in one level,she feel like a stranger.”At eighteen, Pechanac enlisted in the Israeli Air Force. After that, sheenrolled at Nissan Nativ acting school. She dreamed of Hollywood. But she foundonly a few fleeting acting opportunities in plays and music videos. “At all theauditions,” Pechanac later observed, “they all noticed my accent, they allnoticed I was different.”The job at Black Cube presented an ideal compromise. Its operatives were trainedin psyops—psychological operations designed to manipulate targets. Like the bestactors, they were students of body language, of the gentle tics that exposelying and vulnerability. They knew how to read them in others and how to deploythem convincingly themselves. They wore costumes and used technology straightout of spy thrillers: watch-cameras; recording pens. “She went to work in BlackCube,” said the person who knew her well, “’cause she needs to be a character.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]As I presented them with the evidence from Sleeper, the men close to the BlackCube operation dropped their denials. They confirmed, like Boies, that Freedmanwas the journalist in the contract, describing him as an informal adjunct to theteam. They described, in detail, Pechanac’s efforts to insinuate herself intoMcGowan’s life. McGowan had been an easy mark. “She was trusting,” the deepervoice explained. “They became very good friends. I’m sure she’s a bit shocked.”McGowan had told Pechanac that it seemed like everyone in her life was turningout to be secretly connected to Weinstein. She even suspected her lawyers. But,“she, of course, didn’t suspect us.”When I finally told McGowan what I’d learned, she reeled. “It was like the movieGaslight,” she told me. “Everyone lied to me all the time.” For the past year,she said, “I’ve lived inside a mirrored fun house.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 49: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter049]VACUUM [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter049]It wasn’t just Black Cube. The calls led to more calls, and soon a dam wasfracturing and the shadowy underworld of private intelligence spilling itssecrets. There were the conscientious objectors feeding me information abouttheir intelligence agencies. And there were the leaders at those firms,frantically leaking about their competitors in a bid to broaden the focus of myreporting beyond their own activities.Documents and sources illuminated Weinstein’s long relationship with Kroll andDan Karson, the firm’s chairman of Investigations and Disputes for America. Oneformer Weinstein staffer remembered a call in the early 2010s during whichKarson said, of a chauffeur who was involved in a dispute with Weinstein, “Youknow we can put this guy at the bottom of a lake.” The staffer assumed it was afigure of speech but was uncomfortable enough to note it down. Through theyears, Kroll had assisted in Weinstein’s efforts to thwart reporters. SeveralKroll sources said that Weinstein had assigned the firm to dig up unflatteringinformation about David Carr, the late essayist and media reporter, as he hadsuspected. One of the dossiers compiled by Weinstein’s private investigatorsnoted that Carr had never included the allegations of sexual abuse in any of hiscoverage of Weinstein, “due to fear of HW’s retaliation, according to HW.”In 2016 and 2017, Kroll and Karson had worked closely with Weinstein again. Inone October 2016 email, Karson sent Weinstein eleven photographs of McGowan andWeinstein together at events in the years after he allegedly assaulted her.Weinstein’s criminal defense attorney Blair Berk replied that one photo, whichshowed McGowan warmly talking with Weinstein, “is the money shot.” As Wallaceworked on the story, Kroll searched for damaging information about him and AdamMoss, his editor at New York magazine. “No adverse information about Adam Mossso far (no libel/defamation cases, no court records or judgments/liens/UCC,etc.),” Karson wrote in one email. Kroll also sent Weinstein criticism ofWallace’s previous reporting and a detailed description of a UK libel suit filedin response to a book he wrote, which was ultimately settled out of court.PSOPS, the firm founded by Jack Palladino and Sandra Sutherland, had assisted inthe search for damaging information about reporters and accusers. One PSOPSreport on McGowan had sections labeled “Lies/Exaggerations/Contradictions,”“Hypocrisy,” and “Potential Negative Character Wits,” an apparent abbreviationof “witnesses.” A subhead read “Past Lovers.” Palladino sent Weinstein adetailed profile of Moss, noting, “Our research did not yield any promisingavenues for the personal impeachment of Moss.” PSOPS even profiled Wallace’sex-wife, in case she proved “relevant to considerations of our responsestrategy.” The firm’s work on reporters had carried forward through its dossierson me and Jodi Kantor, of the Times, seeking to uncover our sources. (Some ofthe investigators’ observations were more mundane. On Twitter, one documentnoted, “Kantor is NOT following Ronan Farrow.” You can’t have everything.)Weinstein had also worked with K2 Intelligence, a second firm founded by JulesKroll after he sold the firm bearing his name in the 2000s. During the Gutierrezinvestigation, K2 had been retained by Elkan Abramowitz, Weinstein’s attorney.K2 hired Italian private investigators to dig up rumors about Gutierrez’s sexualhistory—the Bunga Bunga parties, the prostitution claims she disputed. Currentand former K2 employees, all of whom had previously worked at the districtattorney’s office, relayed the information about Gutierrez in calls toprosecutors. Lawyers working for Weinstein also presented a dossier of theprivate investigators’ findings to prosecutors in a face-to-face meeting. Two K2employees said that those contacts were part of a “revolving door” culturebetween the DA and high-priced private investigation firms. A spokesperson forVance’s office later said that such interactions with defense attorneys werestandard procedure—and for the wealthy and connected, they were.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The expanding reporting also showed Weinstein’s efforts to enlist journalists inhis campaign to undermine accusers. In caches of Weinstein’s communications, hisalliance with Dylan Howard of the National Enquirer was inescapable. In oneDecember 2016 exchange, Howard sent Weinstein a list of contacts and suggestedthey “discuss next steps on each.” After Weinstein thanked him, Howard describedhis efforts to obtain damaging statements about McGowan from the film producerElizabeth Avellan. Robert Rodriguez, Avellan’s ex-husband and the father of herchildren, had left Avellan to have a relationship with McGowan. Weinsteinfigured Avellan had to be disgruntled.For some of his work on Weinstein’s behalf, Howard turned to a frequentsubcontractor of the National Enquirer, a celebrity photography service calledColeman-Rayner. For the Avellan job, Howard tapped a British reporter who was atthe time a news editor at Coleman-Rayner and who had written celebrity gossipitems for the Sun, the Daily Mail, and the Enquirer itself.When I reached her on the phone, Avellan told me that she remembered theincident well. The reporter “kept calling and calling and calling,” she said,and also contacted others close to her. Avellan finally called back, because “Iwas afraid people might start calling my kids.”Avellan insisted that the call be off the record, and the reporter agreed.Though he was at the time in California, where both parties are legally requiredto consent to recording, he secretly taped her anyway. And so Weinstein andHoward exchanged their excited emails that winter: Howard writing “I havesomething AMAZING… eventually she laid into Rose pretty hard”; Weinsteinreplying, “This is the killer. Especially if my fingerprints r not on this.”Howard assured him there were no prints, and the whole thing had been recorded.I stayed late at The New Yorker, poring over the emails, a vacuum echoingnearby. It was, it would come to pass, just the tip of the iceberg when it cameto the National Enquirer and its work on behalf of prominent men with closelyguarded secrets.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]As we prepared to publish our report about Weinstein’s army of collaborators,panic set in at the institutions named in it. In several calls, Dylan Howardevinced a mix of flattery and menace. “Careful,” he said, as Weinstein had. JuddBurstein, a lawyer working with Howard, followed up with a letter describing thereporting as defamation and libel. When that didn’t prevail, Howard grew angry.He said of me to two colleagues: “I’m going to get him.”Black Cube’s UK-based law firm was sending threats, too, promising to take“appropriate action against you” if we published the Black Cube documents orinformation from them. Inside the agency, Dr. Avi Yanus, the director,contemplated destroying the materials from the Weinstein investigation. “We wishto dispose of every document and information we possess in regards with thisproject,” he wrote in one email. Then he pressed the agency’s lawyers to seek aninjunction to stop The New Yorker from publishing.But we did publish, and the story reverberated like a gunshot. On one programafter another, television personalities expressed disbelief. What did it sayabout the gulf between the powerful and the powerless that wealthy individualscould intimidate, surveil, and conceal on such a vast scale?[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Ostrovskiy, the private investigator, saw the story immediately. He read aboutBlack Cube’s target list, and the journalists on it, and thought back to thejobs of the past summer. He sent the story to Khaykin and asked if he’d seen it.Khaykin replied that they’d have to discuss it in person. A few days later,during a routine stakeout, Ostrovskiy asked again. Khaykin seemed irritated,wanted to get off the subject. But finally, he said, “Now you know who we workfor.”Some time passed before Ostrovskiy had the chance to press the point again. Itwas the dead of night, and the two private investigators were on a boat in thecold waters just north of Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Khaykin loved sailing—he ran asocial media account for sailing enthusiasts. The men were heading back to NewYork after dinner at a waterside restaurant in Atlantic Highlands. Ostrovskiyseized on the chance to bring up Black Cube again.Khaykin fixed his hard eyes on him and said, “To me, this is like doing amitzvah. I’m doing something good for Israel.” Ostrovskiy stared back. It wasnot a mitzvah, and it wasn’t for Israel.“I’m scared, but it’s interesting and it’s exciting,” Ostrovskiy said of theirwork for Black Cube, playing along.“I’m the one who needs to be scared, this whole Weinstein thing was under mylicense,” Khaykin replied. He quickly added: “It was all legal. We never brokethe law.” But he sounded nervous.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]All through the last days of reporting, the men close to the Black Cubeoperation had undertaken a frantic hunt for the source who’d passed me thecontracts and other documents. “We’re investigating everything. All the partiesinvolved, and what was stolen,” the deeper of the two voices said. He mentionedhe was enforcing a new round of polygraphs, and promised to sue anyone hecaught. “We find it hard to believe that a worker would go on a suicide missionlike this,” the higher voice added.“I just want to make sure you are not at risk,” I wrote to Sleeper. “I will doall I can to keep you protected.”A response, quick as usual: “I do appreciate your care… Momentarily, I feelsafe.”Just before we published, I made a last push for the source’s identity. I wrotethat knowing more was a matter of journalistic importance. Sleeper told me onething that made it clear where the documents were coming from—and asked me to doone thing to keep the secret.There was also a note about motive. “I’m an insider who is fed up with BC’sfalse and devious ways of obtaining material illegally,” Sleeper wrote.“Moreover, in this case, I truly believe HW is a sex offender and I’m ashamed asa woman for participating.”I paused, processing this, feeling another moment of hair-prickling realization.That, in the end, is what I can tell you about Sleeper, and the risks she tookto uncover something vast. She was a woman and she’d had enough.“Lets just say that I will never ever give you something that I cant back youfor 100%,” she wrote in one of her final messages to me. “I work in theinformation industry. World of espionage and endless action. Hope we canactually talk about it some day. The project I’m involved in…. out of thisworld, my dear.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 50: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter050]PLAYMATE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter050]The reporting on Dylan Howard and the Enquirer opened up a vein. One afteranother, sources in and around American Media Inc. were calling, saying thatWeinstein wasn’t the only figure with whom the tabloid empire had worked tosuppress stories.Late that November, a lawyer, Carol Heller, wrote to me. There was more, sheexplained, to a report that the Wall Street Journal had published in the fall of2016, about a Playboy model who’d signed over to AMI the exclusive rights to herstory about a purported affair with Donald Trump—a story AMI never published.Heller told me that the woman at the heart of the mystery, a former PlayboyPlaymate of the Year named Karen McDougal, was still “too frightened” to talk.If I could get her and others around the transaction to open up, I might be ableto reveal how the contract with AMI came about, and begin to unravel how theculture of nondisclosure agreements and buried stories extended beyond Hollywoodand into politics.Late that month, I was on the phone with McDougal. She told me the contract withAMI “took my rights away.” It contained a clause that could allow AMI to forceher into a private arbitration process and seek financial damages. McDougal wasstruggling to make ends meet. AMI could wipe her out. “At this point I feel Ican’t talk about anything without getting into trouble,” she told me. Of Trump,she said, “I’m afraid to even mention his name.” But as I gathered moreevidence, including her contract with AMI and accounts of how it came about fromothers involved in the process, McDougal began to share her story.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]McDougal, who grew up in a small town in Michigan and worked as a preschoolteacher before beginning her modeling career, met Trump at a pool party at thePlayboy Mansion. It was June 2006, and he was there to shoot an episode of hisreality show The Apprentice. “Come on over,” he said to a couple of models incorsets and bunny tails. “Wow, beautiful.” The show’s camera operators zoomedand panned like they were nature photographers and breasts were an endangeredspecies. At the time of the party, Trump had been married to the Slovenian modelMelania Knauss for less than two years; their son, Barron, was a few months old.But Trump seemed uninhibited by his new family obligations. McDougal rememberedhim being “all over” her, calling her beautiful. Then he asked for her number.The two began talking frequently and, soon after, met for dinner in a privatebungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. “We talked for a couple hours—then, it was‘ON’! We got naked + had sex,” McDougal wrote in notes about the affair that Ilater obtained. As McDougal got dressed and prepared to leave, Trump offered hermoney. “I looked at him (+ felt sad) + said, No thanks—I’m not ‘that girl.’”Afterward, McDougal “went to see him every time he was in LA (which was a lot).”Over the course of the affair, Trump flew McDougal to public events across thecountry but hid the fact that he paid for her travel. “No paper trails for him,”her notes read. “Every time I flew to meet him, I booked/paid for flight + hotel+ he reimbursed me.” During the relationship, Trump introduced McDougal tomembers of his family and gave her tours of his properties. In Trump Tower,McDougal wrote, Trump pointed out Melania’s separate bedroom. He “said she likedher space,” McDougal wrote.In April 2007, after nine months, McDougal ended the affair. Learning more aboutTrump’s family had brought on a creeping sense of guilt. And Trump’s behaviorchafed against her polite Midwestern sensibility. Once, he called McDougal’smother, who was around his age, “that old hag.” On another occasion, as she andone of her girlfriends joined Trump in his limo on the night of a Miss Universepageant, he started slinging comments about penis size and pressing McDougal’sgirlfriend about her experiences and preferences—asking about “small dicks” and“big dicks” and “black dick.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]A friend of McDougal’s, Johnny Crawford, first proposed selling the story. In2016, as they watched election-season coverage of Trump, Crawford said, “Youknow, if you had a physical relationship with him, that could be worthsomething.” At his urging, McDougal wrote the notes on the affair. She didn’twant to tell her story at first. But when a former friend of hers, fellowPlayboy model Carrie Stevens, started posting about the affair on social media,McDougal figured she should talk before someone else did.Crawford enlisted Jay Grdina, the ex-husband of the porn star Jenna Jameson, tohelp sell the story. Grdina first brokered two meetings between McDougal and JJRendón, a Latin American political operative who was already, by then, denyingmedia reports that he constructed fake bases of support on social media andhacked opponents’ email accounts. When he wasn’t interested, Grdina turned toKeith M. Davidson, an attorney with a track record of selling salacious stories.Davidson got in touch with AMI. Pecker and Howard, in turn, alerted MichaelCohen, Trump’s lawyer. Soon, Trump was on the phone with Pecker, asking forhelp.In June 2016, McDougal and Howard met. Howard then made an offer: initially just$10,000 and then, after Trump won the Republican nomination, considerably morethan that. On August 5, 2016, McDougal signed a limited life-story rightsagreement granting AMI exclusive ownership of her account of any relationshipshe’d had with any “then-married man.” Her retainer with Davidson made explicitthat the man in question was Donald Trump. In exchange, AMI agreed to pay her$150,000. The three men involved in the deal—Davidson, Crawford, and Grdina—took45 percent of the payment as fees, leaving McDougal with a total of $82,500. Theday she signed the contract, McDougal emailed Davidson to express confusion overwhat she was signing up for, and how she’d have to respond to questions fromreporters. “If you deny, you are safe,” Davidson wrote. “We really do need toget this signed and wrapped up…” “I’m the one who took it, so it’s my fault,too,” McDougal told me. “But I didn’t understand the full parameters of it.”As voters went to the polls on Election Day in 2016, Howard and AMI’s generalcounsel were on the phone with McDougal and a law firm representing her,promising to boost McDougal’s career and offering to employ a publicist to helpher handle interviews. That publicist was Matthew Hiltzik, flack to IvankaTrump, who had called me on Weinstein’s behalf—although his services ultimatelywere not used. AMI responded quickly when journalists tried to interviewMcDougal. In May 2017, The New Yorker’s Jeffrey Toobin, who was writing aprofile of David Pecker, asked McDougal for comment about her relationships withAMI and Trump. Howard, working with a different publicist, forwarded McDougal adraft response with the subject line “SEND THIS.” In August 2017, Pecker flewMcDougal to New York and the two had lunch, during which he thanked her for herloyalty.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]In late 2017 and early 2018, as we worked on the story, AMI’s interest inenforcing the contract seemed to increase. On January 30, AMI’s general counselsent an email with the subject line “McDougal contract extension,” proposing arenewal and a new magazine cover to sweeten the deal.That February, our story ran anyway, with McDougal overcoming her fear andagreeing to speak on the record about the matter for the first time. In theyears before, she had become religious and, in turn, fiercely altruistic. “Everygirl who speaks is paving the way for another,” she told me. Her own silence wasabout a consensual affair, but she could help expose a deeper and wider systemof burying stories that was sometimes used to cover up more serious, evencriminal, behavior.The White House called the story “just more fake news.” AMI’s general counselwrote that this report, too, was “false, and defamatory,” and that I’d colludedin “a plot by McDougal and her lawyer to milk AMI for more money.” Howard issuedhis own threats to publicly attack The New Yorker. AMI insisted that it haddeclined to print McDougal’s story because it did not find it credible. It justhadn’t met the Enquirer’s exacting journalistic standards."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 51: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter051]CHUPACABRA [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter051]By the time we published, I’d already heard about another transaction that mightshow that McDougal’s contract was part of a pattern of AMI working to suppressstories for Trump. Friends and colleagues of Dylan Howard contacted me to saythat Howard had boasted that he had evidence that Trump may have fathered achild with his former housekeeper in the late 1980s. Howard “would sometimes saythings when drunk or high. Including telling me they would pay for stories andnot publish, to protect people,” one of the friends told me. “You don’t forgetwhen someone says, ‘Oh, by the way. The maybe-future president has a lovechild.’”In February 2018, I sat down in David Remnick’s office and told him about thestory. “You know what people are going to say when they find out you’rereporting this?” he said, wonderingly. We both laughed. I knew my way around apaternity rumor.There was no evidence that the underlying rumor about the “love child” was true.But that spring, a growing number of documents and sources made clear that AMIreally had bought the rights to the dubious claim, then worked to prevent itsdisclosure.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]In late 2015, Dino Sajudin, a former Trump Tower doorman, had told AMI thestory, along with the names of the supposed mother and child. For weeks,National Enquirer reporters pursued the matter. The tabloid retained two privateinvestigators: Danno Hanks, who ran record searches on the family, and MichaelMancuso, a former criminal investigator, who administered a lie-detector test toSajudin. Several of the reporters doubted Sajudin’s credibility. (His ex-wifewould later call him a fabulist. “He’s seen the chupacabra,” she said. “He’sseen bigfoot.”) But the former doorman passed the polygraph, testifying thathigh-level Trump employees, including Trump’s head of security, MatthewCalamari, had told him the story.Then, David Pecker abuptly ordered the reporters to stop. In November 2015,Sajudin signed an agreement to accept $30,000 for the exclusive rights to theinformation. Soon after, he met with an AMI reporter at a McDonald’s inPennsylvania and signed a further amendment, adding a $1,000,000 penalty if theex-doorman ever disclosed the information without AMI’s permission. The reportertold Sajudin he’d get his money. Sajudin, seeming pleased, said it was going tobe “a very merry Christmas.”As he later did during the McDougal affair, Michael Cohen, Trump’s personalattorney, had monitored the unfolding events closely. “There’s no question itwas done as a favor to continue to protect Trump,” one former AMI employee toldme. “That’s black-and-white.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Later, when journalists sought to report on the rumor, the Enquirer worked tothwart them. In the summer of 2017, two reporters at the Associated Press, JeffHorwitz and Jake Pearson, had reported out and filed a detailed story. As theyneared publication, Howard assembled a muscular legal team and threatened to suethe AP. In July, at AMI’s urging, Sally Buzbee, AP’s executive editor, and hergeneral counsel met with Howard and his team. He’d hired Weinstein’srepresentatives: the lawyers of Boies Schiller and Lanny Davis.The following month, Buzbee announced internally that the story wouldn’t runafter all. “After robust internal discussion, AP news leaders determined thatthe story at the time did not meet AP’s rigorous sourcing requirements,” Buzbeelater said, defending the decision. Several other AP journalists felt thesourcing was robust and expressed shock at the decision. Horwitz left work fordays and had to be persuaded by his bosses to return. For almost a year after,the story stayed dead.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]But the next spring, that was changing. Enquirer sources were beginning to talk.By early March 2018, one was close to sharing a copy of the amendment Sajudinhad signed in late 2015. The source and I met at a rundown Middle Easternrestaurant in Los Angeles, where I spent hours arguing the merits of sharing thedocument. That night, I headed back to Jonathan’s place in West Hollywood, witha printed copy in hand.“When did you realize—” Jonathan said theatrically when I walked in, late.“—I know, I know, that I hate you,” I said. We’d done this before.“We were gonna have dinner,” he said.“Sorry. Ran long.”“You ran long yesterday,” he said, and we proceeded to fight about this. Iwondered how long we could keep going like this, with me absent and consumed andstressed out. Later, with Jonathan bundled off to bed, I stepped out to meet adelivery guy. Directly across the street, a pale thirty-something-year-old manwith dark, stringy hair and stubble was standing next to a car, staring. I wasbeginning to feel that nagging, watched feeling again.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Having dealt with a lifetime of my own curiosity from the press, I didn’t wantto be intrusive. But in order to respect the wishes of the people involved inthe rumor, I had to find out if they wanted to say anything. In mid-March, Iknocked on Sajudin’s door in the woods in rural Pennsylvania. “I don’t talk forfree,” he said, then slammed the door in my face. Emails and calls to thealleged love child—who was now, of course, no longer a child at all—got noresponse. Late that month, I searched California’s Bay Area, trying recentlylisted addresses. I found only one family member, who said, “I’m not supposed totalk to you.” I tried a work address, too. The rumored love child was employedat (seriously) a genetic testing company.Finally, I tried the family’s home in Queens. It was small and faded, withclapboard siding. In a square of grass outside was a little shrine with aplaster Madonna. I stopped by a few times before encountering a middle-aged manI recognized as the husband of the woman who’d allegedly had the affair. He heldup his hands as I approached. “She’s not gonna talk to you or nobody,” he said.He had a straight, uncomplicated inflection and a Latin American accent. He wasconvinced the rumor was untrue. The Enquirer’s transaction had put the family ina difficult situation. “I don’t understand what they had to pay this guy for,”he said. “I’m the dad.”“Got it,” I said, and gave him a condoling look. I told him I was making surethey had the chance to respond if they wanted to. I said I understood how awfulit could feel to have the press circling your family.He nodded. “I understand. You’re Farrow.”“Yeah.”“Oh I know.”And then he was the one with the pitying look.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]By early April, we’d backed up the story with the accounts of six current andformer AMI employees, texts and emails from the time at which AMI struck thedeal, and the amendment Sajudin had signed at the McDonald’s. As it had withMcDougal, the White House denied the affair, and added, “I’d refer you to AMI,”which was one way to respond to a story documenting legally questionablecollaboration with the company in question.Sean Lavery, the boyish Midwesterner assigned to fact-check the story, sent adetailed memo to Howard. Less than thirty minutes later, Radar Online, an AMIwebsite, put out a post acknowledging everything. “Ronan Farrow from The NewYorker,” it read, “is calling our staff, and seems to think this is anotherexample of how The ENQUIRER, by supposedly… killing stories about PresidentTrump is a threat to national security.”Minutes later Howard was emailing. As he had with McDougal, he pled purejournalistic motivation and denied any collaboration with Trump. “You’re aboutto sh*t all over the institution that is The New Yorker,” he wrote to Remnick.“Ronan’s unhealthy obsession with our publication (and me—perhaps it’s mysmile?) puts you at peril.” He added, of me: “he’s about to make for terrificEnquirer fodder.” (Dylan Howard used a lot of italics.)With Howard’s confessional Radar Online post out in the wild, the AP raced torevive its efforts. The AP went live with its resurrected draft, and wepublished our story at The New Yorker, overnight.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Not all of AMI’s efforts on Trump’s behalf panned out. I’d later learn of oneother case in which the company looked into a matter in close concert withTrump’s associates. In early 2016, an anonymous woman—“Katie Johnson” in aninitial legal document, “Jane Doe” in a subsequent one—filed a lawsuit againstTrump. The plaintiff claimed that, in 1994, when she was thirteen years old andnewly arrived in New York City to pursue modeling work, she’d been offered moneyto attend parties hosted by Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire investor, andattended by Trump. Hair-curling allegations of sexual violence followed: thelawsuit contended that the plaintiff and other minors were forced to perform sexacts on Trump and Epstein, culminating in a “savage sexual attack” by Trump;that Trump had threatened the plaintiff and her family with physical harm shouldshe ever speak; and that both Trump and Epstein were told that the girlsinvolved were underage.There was truth in the general context: Epstein was close friends with DonaldTrump. “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump told a reporterin 2002. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautifulwomen as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt aboutit—Jeffrey enjoys his social life.” Miami Herald writer Julie K. Brown laterpublished powerful reporting on widespread allegations that Epstein sexuallyabused minors. In 2019, federal agents arrested him on sex trafficking charges,unraveling a plea deal that had shielded the investor. The lenient agreement hadbeen brokered by Alexander Acosta, a secretary of labor in Trump’s cabinet, whenhe was a prosecutor. He later resigned over the matter. Soon after, Epstein wasfound dead in jail, hanged in an apparent suicide.But, as had been the case with Sajudin’s claims about the love child, theanonymous rape allegation wasn’t backed by convincing evidence. The initialsuit, filed in California, was dismissed on procedural grounds, re-filed in NewYork, then dropped yet again. Norm Lubow, a former producer on The JerrySpringer Show and pusher of several dubious celebrity scandals, helpedorchestrate the lawsuit and acted as the plaintiff’s intermediary in the press.The plaintiff herself was difficult to reach. One attorney who represented hertold me even he sometimes had trouble finding her. Few reporters ever madecontact with her. One, Emily Shugerman, said that the woman’s lawyer canceled aplanned Skype or FaceTime interview several times, then replaced it with a briefphone call. Shugerman emerged as doubtful as most journalists about the storyand the elusive woman at the heart of it. Possibly she was being threatened intoretreat. Or possibly she was an invention of the checkered figures around her.But one additional curiosity was never made public. According to several AMIemployees and one senior associate of Trump’s, Pecker, who was at the time inclose contact with Trump, learned of the lawsuit shortly after it was filed.After that, Howard was on the phone with Cohen, Trump’s personal attorney,assuring him that they would track down the woman with the rape allegation andsee what they could do about her. “Dylan was on the phone with Cohen at allhours” about it, one of the AMI employees recalled. “It became a top priority.”With Cohen monitoring the situation, Howard dispatched an AMI reporter to anaddress associated with one of the initial court filings. But the reporter foundonly a foreclosed home in the sleepy desert community of Twentynine Palms,California. A neighbor said that no one had been there since the previous fall.There was no opportunity to buy this story. Nevertheless, in the early daysafter the anonymous suit, when few media outlets were touching it, AMI ranseveral stories shooting down the claims in the lawsuit. One of the company’sheadlines on the suit quoted Trump calling it “disgusting”; another went with“bogus.”In late 2016, the anonymous woman with the rape allegation resurfaced with newlegal representation. Her new attorney was a professed defender of women, whomHoward would later describe as a “long-time friend”: Lisa Bloom. After helearned that Bloom was working on the case, Howard contacted the attorney towarn her away from it. Eventually, Bloom announced a last-minute cancelation ofa planned press conference with the plaintiff and withdrew the suit for thefinal time.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Other outlets were reporting stories that reinforced the idea of a pact betweenTrump and AMI, too. From early in the reporting on McDougal, I’d heard rumorsthat the porn actress Stormy Daniels had signed a nondisclosure agreementbarring her from talking about a sexual encounter she claimed to have had withTrump. Two months after I started talking to McDougal, the Wall Street Journalreported that Daniels had indeed signed such a contract, arranged directlythrough Michael Cohen. Not included in the Journal’s report was the fact thatDaniels’s lawyer, Keith Davidson, who had previously represented McDougal, hadcalled Dylan Howard about the story first. Howard told Davidson that AMI waspassing on the Daniels matter. Pecker had just extended himself for Trump, andwas growing antsy about the potential for fallout. But Howard directed Davidsonto Michael Cohen, who established a shell company to pay Daniels $130,000 inexchange for her silence. The contract used pseudonyms: Daniels was “PeggyPeterson” and Trump, “David Dennison.”“You know who’s really been fucked?” Davidson later told me. “David Dennison.Who was on my high school hockey team. And he is pissed.”The stories AMI bought and buried during the election, like Sajudin’s andMcDougal’s, along with the ones on which they engaged with Cohen morepreliminarily, like those of Daniels and the anonymous accuser, raised thornylegal and political questions. Trump hadn’t included any of the payments on hisfinancial disclosure forms during the election. As we released our reporting, anonprofit watchdog organization and a left-leaning political group filed formalcomplaints requesting that the Justice Department, the Office of GovernmentEthics, and the Federal Election Commission examine whether the payments toDaniels and McDougal violated federal election law.Legal experts said they might have. The timing, during the election, was goodcircumstantial evidence that AMI’s intent had been to help the campaign; theconversations with Cohen even more so. Media companies have various exemptionsfrom campaign finance law. But that might not apply, the legal experts added,were it established that a media company was acting not in its press capacitybut as an extension of a powerful person’s public relations effort.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]All of the AMI employees I spoke with said that the alliance with Trump haddistorted the place and its business model. “We never printed a word about Trumpwithout his approval,” said Jerry George, the former AMI senior editor. Severalof the employees told me that Pecker had reaped tangible benefits. They saidthat people close to Trump had introduced Pecker to potential sources of fundingfor AMI. In the summer of 2017, Pecker visited the Oval Office and dined at theWhite House with a French businessman known for brokering deals with SaudiArabia. Two months later, the businessman and Pecker met with the Saudi crownprince, Mohammed bin Salman.Some of the employees felt that the most significant reward was AMI’s steadilyaccumulating blackmail power over Trump. Howard bragged to friends that he wasturning down television job offers because he felt his current position, and hisability to hold negative stories over people, gave him more power than anycareer in traditional journalism. “In theory, you would think that Trump has allthe power in that relationship,” Maxine Page, the AMI veteran, told me, “but infact Pecker has the power—he has the power to run these stories. He knows wherethe bodies are buried.” The concern had run through the conversations withMcDougal, too. “Someone in a high position that controls our country, if theycan influence him,” she said of Trump, “it’s a big deal.”The relationship between AMI and Trump was an extreme example of the media’spotential to slip from independent oversight to cocktail party alliances withreporting subjects. But, for AMI, it was also familiar territory. Over theyears, the company had reached deals to shelve reporting around ArnoldSchwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Tiger Woods, Mark Wahlberg, and too manyothers to count. “We had stories and we bought them knowing full well they werenever going to run,” George said.One after another, the AMI employees used the same phrase to describe thispractice of purchasing a story in order to bury it. It was an old term in thetabloid industry: “catch and kill.”"},{"pageContent":"image [images/Art_P349.jpg]toc.xhtml#toc-part005"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 52: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter052]CIRCLE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter052]Dylan Howard had a vindictive streak, ten people who worked with him told me.Former employees would later tell the Associated Press that he “openly describedhis sexual partners in the newsroom, discussed female employees’ sex lives andforced women to watch or listen to pornographic material.” In 2012, in responseto complaints from female colleagues, AMI launched an internal inquiry, led byan outside consultant. The company maintained that the report found no “serious”wrongdoing. Its general counsel confirmed that women had lodged complaints aboutHoward, including one that he’d offered to create a Facebook page for acolleague’s vagina. Maxine Page, the AMI veteran, said she complained on behalfof multiple other women. Liz Crokin, another former reporter, said that aftershe told the outside consultant investigating the matter that Howard harassedher, she believed Howard retaliated against her, assigning her menial tasks andwithholding substantive ones. Howard later denied all allegations of misconductand a spokesperson said the women were “disgruntled.”After my stories, several of Howard’s colleagues said he appeared to be enraged.Two recalled him saying that he was going to “get” me. One warned him that thiswas silly, that the retaliation would be too transparent. Howard was undeterred.For a brief, shining moment, I was an all-caps, sans serif, recurring villain inthe pages of the National Enquirer. A few days after the doorman story broke, afirst comment request arrived, about the uncle I couldn’t recall having met,whom Weinstein had brought up in his legal threat letters: “The NationalEnquirer intends to publish a story reporting Ronan Farrow’s uncle John CharlesVilliers-Farrow was convicted of sexually abusing two 10-year-old boys.” Shortlyafter that, intermediaries began sending messages aggressively soliciting “dickpics.” When I failed to send any, the Enquirer published a complaint that I’drefused. When I responded with anything that seemed flirtatious or frank, Howardran that, too. Howard and his colleagues reached out for comment aboutfabricated yarns, including one implicating me and another journalist, who’dworked on a prominent story critical of AMI, in some sort of Brazilian sex romp.(If only my life were so exciting.)Howard and his associates were calling, emailing. These moves were rote formula.And on the recipient’s side, too, there was a playbook: respond, curry favorwith Howard, trade an item. The other journalist Howard targeted was engagingthe Enquirer through a well-connected lawyer who could have a quietconversation, broker an agreement, ensure that AMI kept the journalist’s nameout. But the other journalist wasn’t working on ongoing reporting on thesubject. I was. Acquiescing to threats from a hostile subject of reporting wasexactly the response that had nearly killed the Weinstein story the year before.I did nothing, and kept reporting.These machinations had been the least elaborate of Howard’s efforts. He hadalso, several AMI employees said, deployed a subcontractor associated withColeman-Rayner—the same infrastructure used to create secret recordings forWeinstein—to surveil Jonathan in Los Angeles. His home had been watched, hismovements followed. Howard would “come in and be like, ‘We’re gonna put a tailon Ronan’s boyfriend,’” one of the employees recalled. And later: “I’ve gotsomeone following him, we’re gonna find out where he’s going.” Howard said theemployees’ assertions were false. In the end, the employees said, Jonathan’sroutine had been so boring the subcontractor surveilling him had given up.“I’m interesting!” Jonathan said, when I told him. “I am a very interestingperson! I went to an escape room!”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]By then, the walls were closing in on AMI. Several outlets, especially the WallStreet Journal, were still digging into the company’s transactions on Trump’sbehalf during the election, and the revelations were spinning up lawenforcement. In April 2018, FBI agents raided Cohen’s hotel and office, lookingfor records related to the payment to McDougal and correspondence between Cohen,Pecker, and Howard. Law enforcement bore down on Pecker and Howard. In responseto my articles, they had denied everything, called the notion of catch and killridiculous, claimed to have had only journalistic intentions. Just a few monthslater, they cut a deal to avoid prosecution for a battery of potential crimes,including violations of campaign finance law, and admitted to everything. In theearly days of Trump’s candidacy, they conceded, Pecker had met with Cohen andanother member of the campaign. “Pecker offered to help deal with negativestories about that presidential candidate’s relationships with women by, amongother things, assisting the campaign in identifying such stories so they couldbe purchased and their publication avoided,” the nonprosecution agreement read.They’d caught, and they’d killed, and the intention had been to swing apresidential election.As part of its agreement with prosecutors, AMI promised to “commit no crimeswhatsoever” for three years. Within the year, the Enquirer was facing questionsas to whether it had breached that clause. Howard threw the full weight of thepublication into chasing a story about Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO ofAmazon, cheating on his wife. This time, Howard secured the dirty pictures hehabitually sought. (Aside from Bezos’s wife and mistress, Dylan Howard appearedto have more interest in the man’s penis than any other person on the planet.)The familiar routine played out: AMI threatened to publish and pressed Bezos tocut a deal. Bezos went on the offensive. “No thank you, Mr. Pecker,” he wrote inan open letter. “Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I’ve decidedto publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost andembarrassment they threaten.”In early 2019, with federal prosecutors circling whether Howard had breached thenonprosecution agreement and AMI swimming in debt, the Enquirer and its sisteroutlets the Globe and the National Examiner were sold for scrap. The purchaser,James Cohen, whose father founded the Hudson News franchise, was mostly known asa collector of art and for throwing his daughter a $1 million bat mitzvah.Questions swirled as to whether Cohen was really financing the agreement himselfor there were others doing so behind the scenes. The New York Post, practicallyexploding with schadenfreude, quoted a source familiar with AMI as saying, “Itlooks like the whole thing could be a big circle.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The walls were closing in on Howard’s ally Harvey Weinstein, too. In the monthsafter the New York Times and New Yorker stories broke, dozens of additionalwomen accused Weinstein of sexual harassment or violence. The number grew tothirty, then sixty, then eighty. Some, including Canosa, filed lawsuits. Lawenforcement in London, Los Angeles, and New York circled. The day after thefirst New Yorker story broke, Sgt. Keri Thompson, a detective from the NYPD ColdCase Squad who had overseen the sting operation in the Gutierrez case yearsearlier, began traveling up and down the Eastern Seaboard to find Lucia Evans,who’d told me that Weinstein sexually assaulted her in his office in 2004. Whenthe detectives found Evans, they told her that if she filed a complaint, itcould help put Weinstein behind bars. Evans wanted to help. But she was scared.She realized, and the detectives conceded, that playing a role in criminalproceedings would be a bruising process. Weinstein’s lawyers would play dirty.They’d throw everything they could at her. “I think everyone’s self-preservationmechanism kicks in when they make a big life decision such as this,” she said.“What is it going to mean to you? How is it going to affect your life, yourfamily, your friends?” After months of sleepless nights, she decided to proceedwith the complaint against Weinstein.Early on the morning of May 25, 2018, a black SUV slid up to the entrance of theNYPD’s First Precinct. As cameras flashed, Thompson and another detective, NickDiGaudio, met Harvey Weinstein at the SUV and led him into the precinct. For theoccasion of his surrender, Weinstein had been styled as a mild-manneredprofessor, in a black blazer and a powder-blue V-neck sweater. Under one arm, hecarried a stack of books about Hollywood and Broadway. Weinstein disappearedinto the building to be booked on charges of rape and a criminal sex act. Whenhe was led out afterward, the books were gone, the hands in cuffs.Weinstein was accompanied by his latest attorney, Benjamin Brafman, and aprivate detective named Herman Weisberg. Weisberg was a former NYPD detectivehimself, and his firm, Sage Intelligence and Security, flaunted that expertisemuch as the Israelis did their former Mossad status. He’d been on the Weinsteinteam for a while—the previous fall, before my story broke, he’d been on theMcGowan beat, arriving at one meeting with Weinstein to announce that he’duncovered a not-yet-public police inquiry into whether she’d been caughtcarrying drugs. “Can we leak that?” Weinstein had said, excited. Formercolleagues called Weisberg a “bloodhound.” He specialized in ferreting out andinterrogating witnesses.For all the symbolism of the perp walk, Weinstein posted $1 million bail thatday and went home. Ankle-braceleted, he was permitted to move between his homesin New York and Connecticut. In the ensuing months, the NYPD case expanded fromtwo women to three, adding a charge of “predatory sexual assault” from MimiHaleyi, a former production assistant who claimed Weinstein sexually assaultedher at his apartment in 2006. But Weinstein’s offensive expanded, too, itstendrils encircling those who agreed to participate in the case and those whoworked on it.In the press and to prosecutors, Brafman raged that Weinstein had friendlymessages from Haleyi, including one seeking a meeting after the alleged assault.And, after Weisberg’s labors, fruitful grounds emerged for discreditingDiGaudio, the detective. A peripheral witness in Lucia Evans’s case claimedshe’d given DiGaudio new details that he then withheld from prosecutors.DiGaudio denied it—but it was all the ammunition Brafman needed. He expressedpublic outrage and accused law enforcement of a conspiracy against Weinstein.DiGaudio was removed from the case. Lucia Evans’s count against Weinstein wasdropped. “Two things can be true,” a source in the district attorney’s officetold me. “You can believe a survivor but consent to dismissal of her countbecause maintaining it would result in a weakening of the other counts, becauseof things that happened in the process.”Brafman attributed the move to bravura private espionage. “Whatever success Imay have in the Weinstein case, Herman has played a substantial part in thoseaccomplishments,” Brafman said, explaining that Weisberg had helped “uncovermaterials” about “several of the important prosecution witnesses.”Soon, the myriad lawsuits were looking like they might resolve cleanly forWeinstein, too. A few months after Evans’s count was dropped, reports began tocirculate that Weinstein and the Weinstein Company’s former board wereconsidering a $44 million blanket settlement to resolve the civil claims.Much remained arrayed against Weinstein. Several remaining criminal counts inNew York awaited trial. Authorities in Los Angeles and London continued to buildcases. Several women with civil claims looked askance at the prospect of abreezy blanket settlement and publicly pledged to keep going with theirlawsuits.As Weinstein prepared for the criminal trial, a small item about him ran in PageSix. In a photo, he leaned over the counter at Cipriani Dolci on the mezzaninelevel of Grand Central. His pink neck bulged out of a loose-fitting black tee.Several inches of boxers showed over sagging jeans. He looked thinner, older,more hunched than before. The item was about the group of dark-suited menhuddled around Weinstein, heads bowed in focused conversation. The copy saidthat one was a private investigator, another a lawyer.However far he had fallen, there was Harvey Weinstein, with his mercenaries,plotting, planning, and bracing for fights to come. For Weinstein and otherslike him, the army of spies was alive and well."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 53: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter053]AXIOM [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter053]It was after the love child story, and summer again, when I stumbled into thefirst clues about Black Cube’s activities following the Weinstein job. I’d justslipped onto a hot, airless subway car when the call came in. The caller ID read“Axiom.” A moment later, I got a text. “I am trying to reach you directly andprivately. It’s regarding a Fry Pan that’s Scratch Resistant. Sometimes I cookand the black coating scares me.”I’d recently posted a social media picture of a frying pan marketed under thelabel “Black Cube.” “Scratch resistant. May use false identities and shellcompanies to extract information,” I’d written. (“Hahaha,” Ambra Gutierrezcommented drily.)As the subway car slipped into a tunnel, I wrote back, “Can you say more aboutwho you are?”“I can say I do surveillance.” And, later, resisting my entreaties for moreinformation: “We will need to meet discreetly and make sure we are notfollowed.”A few days after, I was threading my way through the perspiring crowds of thetheater district. I’d suggested we meet at the Brazilian restaurant where I gotthe recording from Gutierrez. I arrived on time, asked for a table for two, satdown. The phone rang with an encrypted Signal call. “Axiom” appeared on thescreen again.“Don’t order,” said a man’s voice.I looked around again. No one I could see.“You are wearing the messenger bag, light blue shirt, and slightly darkerjeans,” he continued. He told me to leave and walk slowly.“Walk against traffic, please.”I craned my neck around.“Don’t look around,” he continued, a little annoyed. “I’ll be about a half ablock away, so please stop for 1–1.5 minutes at the intersections. I’m going tomake sure no same people show up there from here.”As he took me on a circuitous route through Hell’s Kitchen, I tried to checkagain. “Don’t look, just walk naturally. Against traffic. It’s good, keepgoing.” He told me to stop at a basement Peruvian restaurant that lacked cellreception. “Ask for a table in the back, all the way in the back.”I did as he said. Ten minutes later, a man sat down in front of me. His hair wasdark and curly, and he was a little soft around the middle. He had a thickUkrainian accent.“I’m a concerned party,” said Igor Ostrovskiy. He slid a phone across the table.Motioned for me to swipe through the pictures on it. There was my block, myfront door, my superintendent outside. And there was the Nissan, with two meninside: Ostrovskiy, dark and chubby, and Khaykin, pale and bald, with a fierceglare.Ostrovskiy said that they were with a local private investigation firm licensedin New York. “But the work product, the final reports, Black Cube was puttingtheir name on it.”“Why are you doing this?” I asked.While much of the work the subcontractors did was routine—tracking cheatingspouses or digging for dirt in custody cases that “might not be ethical, butit’s legitimate”—their work for Black Cube was something else. Ostrovskiy toldme about their efforts to track me, in person and through my phone. I thoughtback to the spam texts—the weather updates, and then the blitz of politicalsurveys I got at the World Trade Center. He didn’t know if either was connected,but did say he’d gotten accurate information about my location at roughly thesame time that I’d received the survey texts. “I fear,” Ostrovskiy told me,“that it may be illegal.” He took issue with the tactics used against me. And itwasn’t just me. The subcontractors were still following people for Black Cube.Ostrovskiy wanted to know why.He read me a list of target names, and the dates and times of the operationssurveilling them. At one upscale hotel restaurant after another, thesubcontractors had monitored meetings between Black Cube agents and marks whoappeared to be experts in technology and cybercrime. Several had expertise inaggressive new solutions for hacking and monitoring cell phones—like the Pegasussoftware made by the Israeli cyber intelligence firm NSO Group, which Sleeperhad worried about.Ostrovskiy said that the limited information he possessed was “designed to betraceable back to me.” He was anxious that he was being surveilled. He’d evenswept the area surrounding the restaurant before entering.I was also becoming watchful. I’d asked a colleague to follow a few blocksbehind, then keep an eye on the restaurant. Unjin Lee, a slight Korean Americanwoman who just cleared five feet, wasn’t much for Krav Maga, but she’d spot anytails.Ostrovskiy and I left separately, ten minutes apart. When I got a safe distanceaway, Lee called. A man had appeared to follow the two of us, lagging behind aswe entered, and lingering by the entrance for more than an hour.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Nothing is certain, it turns out, except death and taxes and investigation bythe Southern District of New York. Federal prosecutors there had begun to circleBlack Cube after my story about the spy agency in late 2017, launching aninvestigation out of their Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit. It didn’t takelong before the prosecutors, who were looking at Harvey Weinstein and AMI, too,were hoping to meet with me, not as a reporter but as a witness.The calls and messages from the Southern District started coming in the daysfollowing the McDougal story in February 2018 and didn’t let up in the monthsthat followed. The inquiries came from the Southern District prosecutorsthemselves and from intermediaries, including Preet Bharara, the former U.S.Attorney there. They came to me and to Bertoni, The New Yorker’s lawyer.A law school classmate working in law enforcement had been sending messages,too, asking to catch up. Not long after Ostrovskiy and I first met, I made myway through the heat to dinner at a small restaurant near the World TradeCenter.I was sitting at the bar, sweaty and dowdily suited, when his voice sounded.“Hi, there.”I looked up from my phone. A row of perfect teeth flashed. He was symmetrical toa catalogue-model standard. Even his name was an actor name, a pretend name, thename of the most trustworthy doctor in a 1950s suburb.He slid closer. Another blinding smile. “Been a long time!”Me, feeling shlubby: “I’ve been busy.”“Can’t imagine with what.”He ordered us drinks, then we settled into a booth.It was a lovely dinner, with much “how is so-and-so?” I’d forgotten how much I’dwithdrawn from my own life. Were it not for the aggressive surveillance efforts,I’d have had no social life at all.He’d married, he said.“How’s that?”He shrugged. “Complicated. You?”“Good. He’s great.” A beat of silence. I thought about the long, tense year withJonathan.“But also complicated?” he asked.“Well, long-distance is hard.”He looked at me sympathetically. “You’re under a lot of pressure.”“It’s not so bad now. And you must be, too.”He leaned in. The warmest smile yet, no longer appropriate for catalogues, even.“It doesn’t have to be like this, you know,” he said. I could feel his breathacross the narrow table. “Dealing with all of this. By yourself.”He was adjusting a knife in front of him a little, running a finger up itssilvered length.“Are you talking about—”“You should come in.”“Oh.”“Be a witness. You won’t have to reveal any sources you don’t want to.”I withdrew, sitting up straight. “You know you can’t guarantee that.”“So?” he said. “If you’re a victim, you should talk.”The personal interest seemed benign and separate from the professionalentreaties. But the two dynamics jostled uncomfortably. As we stepped out intothe night and said our goodbyes, he lingered for a moment during a parting hug.“Call me,” he said. “If you change your mind about any of it.” Then he wasflashing the Crest ad smile over his shoulder, walking off into the night.Bertoni and I turned over the dilemma. Working with law enforcement was afraught decision for any journalistic outlet. There were obvious scenarios inwhich journalists should go to the cops, including any tip-off about impendingphysical harm to someone. But there were no easy calls in this case. It wasn’tinconceivable that I’d been a victim of a crime, flowing from the phone trackingor the deceptions designed to elicit reporting material from me. But I wasn’tconfident that there was enough danger to myself or others to merit sitting withprosecutors and answering questions that might quickly turn to sources andreporting I’d pledged to keep secret. Protecting those sources, includingOstrovskiy, had to be my priority. And it wasn’t just about me. Bertoni fearedthat any one conversation with law enforcement would set a dangerous precedentfor The New Yorker. Would we as easily be able to decline inquiries about, say,a government whistle-blower, once we’d already said yes on this story?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 54: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter054]PEGASUS [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter054]At first, Ostrovskiy wouldn’t give me the name of his boss. But there were morethan enough clues. In one of the images he’d shown me, the Nissan’s licenseplates were even visible. I typed in the name I’d come up with and pulled up apromotional video. “I’m the guy out in the field. The action-taker,” a bald manwith a Russian accent said in the video. “My name is Roman Khaykin. And I’m thefounder of InfoTactic Group.”A jaunty techno beat played. Over footage of buttonhole cameras, title cardspromised “the best high-tech surveillance equipment.” Khaykin, doing his bestimpression of James Bond or Ethan Hunt, darted athletically through crowds. Itwas beguilingly cheesy. InfoTactic was small-time, just a handful offreelancers, most of them with day jobs. Still, Khaykin, over the course of thatpast year working for Black Cube, had sought to push the envelope, from thephone tracking to the boasts about his ability to illicitly obtain financialrecords.In the video, Khaykin was deadly serious about his skills. “When I was young andfirst learned how to read,” he said, “I would fascinate my parents with myability to memorize the text of my favorite book—Sherlock Holmes.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Ostrovskiy kept passing along his insights about InfoTactic’s ongoing operationsfor Black Cube. Sometimes I’d go to the appointed location, or send colleagueswho were less likely to be spotted, to keep watch from afar. The pattern wasalways the same: undercover Black Cube agents meeting with cybercrime andtechnology experts in luxe hotels.Ostrovskiy and I would meet, too, at hole-in-the-wall restaurants we’dimmediately depart in favor of jumpy conversations conducted while walking mazyroutes through side streets. Once, we sat in a dim corner of a hotel lobby andspoke for half an hour before he abruptly excused himself, then came backworried, saying we had to move, fast. He suspected two men sitting nearby werefollowing us. They looked like professionals. They’d been watching too closely.We took a cab, and then another cab. He had one taxi stop on the West SideHighway, pull over to the shoulder, and wait for any tails to go by or beexposed for slowing. A year before, I’d have thought the paranoia excessive.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Through the remainder of 2018, I continued my reporting on the world of Israeliprivate intelligence, keeping at Black Cube in the process. Eido Minkovsky, thegenial freelancer who handled the spy agency’s public relations, was a regularcontact. “Ronan, baby,” he’d say, when I called. “Don’t divorce me,” he’d write,responding evasively to my latest reporting inquiry. In January 2019, he agreedto have a drink during one of his regular stops in New York.Several hours before that meeting, Ostrovskiy called. Black Cube had orderedRoman Khaykin and InfoTactic to find a pen capable of secretly recording audio.Ostrovskiy sent a picture of the spy pen they’d found. It was piano-black, witha silver clip: nothing you’d notice if you weren’t looking for it, but it hadfeatures you could track, like a little ring of chrome at a specific height onits barrel.Minkovsky and I had agreed to meet at a wine bar in Hell’s Kitchen. I arrived tofind him lounging in a corner with a Cheshire cat grin. Minkovsky ordered acocktail, led with his usual flattery offensive. Then he announced that he wasgoing to take notes on my reporting questions. He produced, from his jacketpocket, a black pen with a silver clip.“Funny, I have the same one,” I said.His grin faltered. “It’s a special pen,” he said. “From Minkovsky Industries.”I asked Minkovsky if he was recording. He looked injured. He informed Zorella,the Black Cube founder, of any meetings, of course. He had to—he was polygraphedperiodically. But: “Ronan, I would never, ever record.”Later, Minkovsky would maintain that the pen he’d taken out was perfectlyinnocent, and that he wasn’t aware of any other. But on my way out of themeeting that night, I texted Ostrovskiy, “Do you know who that pen was deliveredto?”—and he replied with a string of pictures, all showing Minkovsky, justbefore we met, standing on a corner, accepting delivery of the spy pen.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]A few days later the spy pen appeared to resurface in Black Cube’s latestoperation. A middle-aged man with a neat white beard, who identified himself asMichael Lambert, sat down for lunch with John Scott-Railton, a researcher forthe watchdog group Citizen Lab. Lambert had said he worked for the Paris-basedagricultural technology firm CPW-Consulting, and asked to meet aboutScott-Railton’s doctoral research on using kite-mounted cameras to create maps,which is a thing, apparently.But as food arrived, Lambert’s interests strayed. Citizen Lab, which tracksstate-backed efforts to hack and surveil journalists, had recently reported thatNSO Group’s Pegasus software compromised an iPhone belonging to a friend of thejournalist Jamal Khashoggi, not long before Saudi operatives cut Khashoggi topieces with a bone saw. The investigation had prompted sharp criticism of NSOGroup, which denied that its software was used to target Khashoggi but alsorefused to answer questions about whether the software had been sold to theSaudi government. Lambert wanted to know about Citizen Lab’s work on NSO Group.He asked whether there was any “racist element” to the focus on an Israeligroup. He pressed Scott-Railton about his views on the Holocaust. As they spoke,Lambert took out a black pen with a silver clip and a chrome ring on its barrel.He laid it just so on a legal pad in front of him, tip pointed at Scott-Railton.The script was familiar. In the operations in which Stella Penn Pechanac hadbeen involved, targeting employees of West Face Capital and critics of AmTrustFinancial Services, Black Cube agents had also solicited anti-Semiticstatements. But this time, the mark was wise to it: suspecting subterfuge,Scott-Railton had decked himself out with recording devices. He’d been tapingthe whole time.It was a spy vs. spy confrontation of sorts—and each had brought his own tail asbackup. Raphael Satter, an Associated Press journalist with whom Scott-Railtonhad been working, arrived with a camera and started questioning the man who wasnot named Michael Lambert after all. The Black Cube agent’s cover had beenblown. From a table nearby, Ostrovskiy had been watching and photographing themeeting, too. Khaykin, who had been there earlier and then departed, startedcalling, apoplectic. “Our guy got burned!” he said. “Get to the lobbyimmediately! He needs to get out.”The Black Cube agent ducked out of a service entrance. Ostrovskiy picked up theagent and his luggage, then drove around, trying to shake potential tails. Asthey drove, the agent placed frantic calls, trying to book the first possibleflight out of New York. On his luggage was a tag bearing the name “ALMOG” and ahome address in Israel. This name was real: the agent was AharonAlmog-Assouline, a retired Israeli security official later reported to have beeninvolved in a string of Black Cube operations.Black Cube and NSO Group would later deny any connection to the operationagainst Citizen Lab. But in many of the meetings Ostrovskiy had described to meover the preceding months, Almog-Assouline had been there, appearing to targetfigures who criticized NSO Group and argued that its software was being used tohunt journalists.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Black Cube was furious about the botched operation. The agency ordered thateveryone with knowledge of the matter be polygraphed immediately. Ostrovskiycalled, worried that it was only a matter of time before he was exposed. Hewanted to talk, and not just to a reporter. He had knowledge of espionageoperations, by agents closely linked to a foreign government, on American soil.He had already tried the FBI, only to be passed between skeptical agents whofinally hung up. He asked if I had a better contact in law enforcement. I calledBertoni. He was still adamant about keeping direct engagement with prosecutorsto a minimum. But he agreed that there was nothing wrong with informing a sourceabout how to get to the authorities.The last time I discussed the matter with my old classmate was at anotherrestaurant in the Financial District. I stepped messily out of a downpour. He,neatly dry, flashed another perfect smile and ordered drinks.“You should think about it,” he said again. On the table, his hand was ahairsbreadth from mine. “You don’t have to deal with all this alone.”I turned over how it would feel. Then I withdrew my hand by a few inches. I saidI wouldn’t talk, but I had sources who might. I asked for the right contact togive them.Soon after, I sent Ostrovskiy a name at the Southern District of New York.Ostrovskiy got a lawyer—John Tye, the same whistle-blower attorney Iconsulted—and began the process of volunteering to be a witness."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 55: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter055]MELTING [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter055]At NBC News, the year after the Weinstein story was fraught. In late November2017, Savannah Guthrie, wearing a floral-print black dress fit for a morning TVfuneral, announced that Matt Lauer had been fired overnight. A “detailedcomplaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace”had come in less than forty-eight hours before. She said she was “heartbroken,”calling Lauer “my dear, dear friend” and emphasizing that he was “loved by many,many people here.”Guthrie read a statement from Andy Lack that suggested management was shockedabout Lauer, too. The unnamed colleague had lodged “the first complaint abouthis behavior in the over twenty years he’s been at NBC News.” The network movedquickly to reinforce that idea in the wider press.After the announcement, Oppenheim gathered members of the investigative unit inthe conference room on the fourth floor. He said that, while the behavioralleged by the unnamed colleague was “unacceptable,” the breach was ofprofessional, not criminal, standards of conduct. “Some of the behavior tookplace in the workplace. And Matt Lauer is Matt Lauer,” he said. “So there’sobviously a power differential there.” But, Oppenheim emphasized, the networkemployees who spoke with the unnamed colleague “did not report her using wordslike ‘criminal’ or ‘assault.’” Soon, articles to which NBC’s communications teamcontributed were conveying the same message. When the network collaborated withPeople magazine on a cover story announcing Hoda Kotb as Lauer’sreplacement—“Hoda & Savannah: ‘Our Hearts Were Broken,’” read the headline—thisparty line would become more explicit. “Multiple sources describe the cause fortermination as an affair that violated NBC’s terms of employment,” that articleread. “Sources initially told The Post that Lauer had been accused of sexualassault,” Page Six reported, “but later said it was inappropriate sexualbehavior.” Outlets in contact with NBC at the time said the network made noattempt to alter the characterizations of the matter as an affair.Oppenheim also echoed Lack’s suggestion that the network had been unaware of anycomplaints about Lauer until two days before, when the unnamed colleague cameforward. The statement struck several journalists present as strange. Varietyand the New York Times had both been working on articles accusing Lauer ofserial sexual misconduct for weeks, calling numerous people at the network inthe process. And many in the building had heard of complaints about Lauer longbefore that. At the meeting with Oppenheim, McHugh spoke up again: “Prior toMonday, a lot of us have heard rumors of stuff about Matt… let’s just say that.Prior to Monday, was NBC aware of any allegations of sexual misconduct againstMatt?”“No,” Oppenheim said. “We went back and looked, and, as we said in thestatement, there has not been an allegation made internally in twenty years” in“any place where there would be a record of such a thing.” The qualifyinglanguage was significant: that there would be no formal HR records about afigure of Lauer’s importance was practically an assumption. Weinstein had alsobeen adamant that there were no “formal” records of sexual misconductallegations in his file, either. So had Bill O’Reilly at Fox News. But thatwasn’t the question. McHugh hadn’t asked about formal records—he’d asked whetherNBC had been “aware.” And on this, Oppenheim was less clear. “We all read theNew York Post and walk past supermarket checkout stands and see the NationalEnquirer,” he said. “There’s not a lot you can do with that, especially when theparties involved are saying this is National Enquirer nonsense.”Oppenheim was right: Lauer, AMI’s employees and internal records would laterreveal, had been of great interest to the Enquirer all through 2017 and 2018.One email exchange within the tabloid even contained the résumé of the anonymouscolleague whose accusations precipitated the firing.Not long after, Greenberg called McHugh into his office for what McHughsuspected was an effort to determine whether he was talking to the press. McHughsaid that he was disquieted by what he was learning about NBC’s in-houseproblems, and the bearing they might have had on our Weinstein coverage. “That’swhat people are talking about, they’re all saying that—”“That they were covering up Matt Lauer,” Greenberg said.“Yeah,” McHugh replied.“You really think they were aware of a problem with Matt Lauer?” Greenberg said.McHugh looked him in the eye and said, “I do.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Over the following months, the message that no one at NBC knew about Lauerbecame a steady drumbeat. In May 2018, NBCUniversal announced the final resultsof an internal investigation: “We found no evidence indicating that any NBC Newsor Today show leadership, News HR or others in positions of authority in theNews Division received any complaints about Lauer’s workplace behavior prior toNov. 27, 2017,” the self-report concluded. The network had resisted calls for anindependent investigation, both within the company and in the press. Outsidelawyers were enlisted to review the results after the fact, but the research wasconducted entirely by Kim Harris’s team, including Stephanie Franco, thecompany’s senior vice president for employment law. The day the internal reportwas announced, Oppenheim and Harris called another crisis meeting with theinvestigative unit. The assembled journalists erupted with skeptical questions.McHugh was again among them. “Has NBC ever paid an employee who presentedinformation on Matt to sign a nondisclosure agreement?” he asked. Harrisblinked. “Umm,” she said, “no.”Then he asked if there had been any settlements in the last “six or seven years”with any employees related to harassment in general. More hesitation. “Not thatI’m aware of,” Harris said finally.At one point in the meeting, Harris appeared to grow impatient with thejournalists’ calls for an independent review. “It feels like having an outsidevoice, whether they came to the same conclusions or not, would make it go awayquicker,” said one woman in the room. “It’s so frustrating.”“Well, if the press would stop covering it, it will go away,” Harris said.There was a pause, then still another investigative journalist said, “But we arethe press.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]From the beginning, other outlets were publishing reporting at odds withOppenheim’s and Harris’s characterizations of what the network knew. Hours afterNBC announced Lauer’s termination, Variety asserted that “several women…complained to executives at the network about Lauer’s behavior, which fell ondeaf ears given the lucrative advertising surrounding Today.” The publicationsuggested that the complaints about Lauer were an open secret. He had given onecolleague a sex toy, with an explicit note about how he hoped to use it on her.He’d played “fuck/marry/kill” games on open mics during commercial breaks. Clipsof a similar tenor began to surface, including one of Lauer in 2006, seeming totell Meredith Vieira, “Keep bending over like that. It’s a nice view.” At a 2008private Friars Club roast of Lauer, Katie Couric had performed a DavidLetterman–style top ten list that included a reference to a sex act betweenLauer and Ann Curry, and Jeff Zucker, then the head of NBCUniversal, did a bitabout Lauer’s wife forcing him to sleep on the couch because of hisindiscretions. Donald Trump, then the host of The Celebrity Apprentice, hadattended. “The whole theme was that he does the show and then he has sex withpeople, with employees,” Joe Scarborough said on air. “So was this whisperedbehind closed doors? No. It was shouted from the mountaintops and everybodylaughed about it.”Several junior Today employees said Lauer had been brazen in pursuing sexualencounters with them in the office. Addie Collins, a former productionassistant, told me that Lauer had aggressively, almost obsessively, hit on herin 2000, when she was twenty-four years old. She’d kept many of the notes he’dsent her over work email or in the software used to maintain show rundowns. “NOWYOU’RE KILLING ME… YOU LOOK GREAT TODAY! A BIT TOUGH TO CONCENTRATE,” read atypical one. Because of Lauer’s power in their workplace, Collins told me she’dfound it difficult to decline when he started ordering her to his dressing room,or even, on one occasion, to a bathroom stall, for sexual favors. She’dconsented, but it had made her feel sick, afraid for her job, afraid ofretaliation. Though she couldn’t prove it, she suspected Lauer later contributedto her missing out on professional opportunities.Some of the women claimed their office encounters with Lauer had not beenconsensual. One former NBC employee told the New York Times that, in 2001, Lauersummoned her to his office, then pressed the button on his desk that, like thosein many executive offices at 30 Rock, remotely shut his door. She said she’dfelt helpless as he’d pulled down her pants, bent her over a chair, and had sexwith her. She passed out. Lauer’s assistant took her to a nurse.Over the course of 2018, I’d learn of seven claims of sexual misconduct raisedby women who worked with Lauer. Most of the women could point to documents orother people they’d told to back up their accounts. Several said they had toldcolleagues, and believed the network knew about the problem.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]I was also beginning to learn of a pattern surrounding women with complaints. Inthe years after 2011 or 2012—the time frame in which Harris claimed NBC hadn’tsettled with any employees over harassment issues—the network in fact brokerednondisclosure agreements with at least seven women who experienced allegedharassment or discrimination within the company. The agreements also requiredthe women to waive their right to bring suit. In most cases, the women receivedsubstantial payouts that parties involved in the transactions said weredisproportionate to any conventional compensation for departing the company.When Harris said she was unaware of any harassment settlements, she appeared tobe capitalizing on a technicality: many of the payouts were what the networkreferred to as “enhanced severance,” offered to the women as they left theirjobs. But individuals involved—including on the company’s side—disputed thatcharacterization, saying the agreements were designed to restrain women withallegations from speaking.Several of the women who signed the nondisclosure agreements had complaints thatwere unrelated to Lauer, about other men in leadership positions within NBCNews. Two settlements, reached in the first few years of the period Harrisdescribed, were with women who experienced alleged harassment from two seniorexecutives who subsequently left the company. “Everyone knew why they were letgo, internally,” said one member of NBC’s leadership who was closely involved inthe departure of both men. NBC also brokered the 2017 agreement with the womanwho accused Corvo—the Dateline producer who oversaw the review of the Weinsteinstory—of sexually harassing her.But other pacts called into question the network’s claim that it had knownnothing about women’s allegations against Lauer.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]One on-air personality, who signed a nondisclosure agreement in 2012, said thatNBC sought the deal after she showed colleagues messages that she took to bepropositions, from both Lauer and one of the senior executives who laterdeparted the company. Colleagues recalled both men making lewd remarks about theon-air personality over open mics during broadcasts. “I was like a hanging pieceof meat,” she said. “I would walk into work with a knot in my stomach. I wouldcome home and cry.” After she declined the advances, she felt she received fewerassignments. “I got punished,” she said. “My career took a sharp nosedive.” Shedecided not to make a formal report because she doubted the efficacy of thecompany’s HR department and feared further harm to her career. She did, however,begin to tell colleagues, and to plan her departure from the company.When NBC proposed the agreement as she departed, she recalled her agent saying,“I’ve never seen this before in my life. They want you to sign an NDA,” adding,“You must have something huge on them.” The agent told me that he recalled theexchange too. The contract, which I later reviewed, waived the on-airpersonality’s right to sue. It barred her from making negative statements aboutNBCUniversal, “except as may be required for bona fide news reporting.” It wason NBC News letterhead, signed by her and the executive she said harassed her.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Another settlement with a woman who disclosed a serious allegation about Lauerwithin the company was reached in 2013. A few months after the Lauer storybroke, I took a seat next to Ann Curry, his former co-anchor, at an Italianrestaurant in Greenwich Village. She sat on a bar stool next to me, face gravenwith concern. She told me that complaints about Lauer verbally harassing womenin the office were well known in her day—and that once, in 2010, a colleague hadpulled her into an empty office and broken down, saying Lauer had exposedhimself and propositioned her. “It was as close as you could get to a woman justmelting in front of you in pain,” Curry said.Later, I’d learn the woman’s identity: Melissa Lonner, the Today producer whomet with me after she left to work in radio. As Lonner told the story tocolleagues, she and Lauer had been at a work event at 30 Rock the evening beforeshe broke down in front of Curry. Lauer had asked her to leave the event to seehim in his office, which she took to be a professional inquiry. When theyarrived, he closed the door behind them.She recalled standing expectantly and telling Lauer, “I thought you had tochat.” Lauer told her to sit on his couch and began to make small talk. He jokedabout how much he disliked work cocktail parties like the one they’d justattended. Then, she told the colleagues, he unzipped his pants and exposed hiserect penis.Lonner was separated from her husband but still married. Born in the slums ofBangkok, she’d worked hard to reach her professional role at the time. Sheremembered reeling in response to Lauer’s advance, laughing nervously, trying toextricate herself by cracking a joke about not wanting to be intimate in anoffice where “everyone else has done it.”Lonner recalled Lauer saying that he knew she wanted it, and, in response to thejoke about his office dalliances, that he figured she liked it dirty, and thatthe encounter would “be a first for you.” Then, by her account, he became angry,saying, “Melissa, you’re a fucking tease. This is not good. You led me on.”Sources close to Lauer told me he disputed her account of events, saying that herecalled making a joking lewd gesture but not exposing himself or propositioningher. But Lonner, visibly distraught, began recounting her claim in detail thenext day, and told it consistently in the years after. She begged Curry andanother on-air personality not to report her name, saying she knew Lauer woulddestroy her career. But Curry did tell two senior executives at the company thatthey needed to do something about Lauer. “I told them that they had a problem inhim. That he had a problem with women. That they had to keep an eye on him.” Andthen, as far as Curry ever heard, nothing happened.Lonner told the colleagues that she was miserable afterward. Lauer didn’t talkto her for weeks. Afraid that she’d be fired, she began looking for other jobs.But when she got an offer at CNN, something strange happened: several NBC Newsexecutives called her into their offices for meetings and delivered the samemessage. Each said that Lauer had insisted that she stay. “I don’t know what’sgoing on between you and him,” one told her, “But I need to keep him happy.”She stayed at the network. Several years later, as her contract was about toend, she was fired anyway. She told the colleagues she was never given a reasonwhy. A lawyer she consulted noted that the delayed departure prevented her fromraising harassment claims due to their statutes of limitations. As Lonner leftNBC News, her agent called to report something unusual: in addition to standardnondisclosure and nondisparagement clauses, the network was offering her asix-figure sum in exchange for signing a release of rights. “I’ve never seenthat before,” the agent told her. “You must know where all the skeletons are.”Lonner’s understanding was that the primary intention of the payout was toprevent her from talking to the press.Despite the fact that Lonner was a behind-the-scenes figure, tabloid itemssurfaced about her, claiming she was difficult to work with. Lonner told friendsthat she believed she’d been smeared because of her refusal of Lauer’s overture.When I asked Lonner about NBC, she told me she was unable to comment on her timethere. NBC disputed the idea that Lonner’s payout was related to her complaintabout Lauer. But the network appeared to harbor some awareness of theconnection. In 2018, as a Daily Beast reporter named Lachlan Cartwright pursueda story about NBC’s purported pattern of settlements with sexual harassmentvictims, Stephanie Franco, the senior employment lawyer at NBCUniversal,contacted Lonner’s lawyer to remind her of the existence, and enforceability, ofher pact. NBC’s legal team would later say that the call was in response to aquery from Lonner’s attorney, and provided notice of Lonner’s release of legalclaims, rather than any nondisclosure provision.The settlements continued in the years after. In 2017, the senior member of theToday show team I’d seen crying on set a year before received a seven-figurepayout in exchange for signing a nondisclosure agreement. In communications thatI reviewed surrounding the contract, attorneys emphasized that the promise ofsilence was the primary objective, not an incidental provision. As her contractwith the network ended, she’d raised harassment and discrimination concerns,though the network said that the payout was unrelated to any specific complaint.She had also mentioned Lauer and sexual harassment to one senior vicepresident—though she didn’t share with them the material I later reviewed thatshowed Lauer had left voicemails and sent texts that she saw as passes at her.When he took her responses as a cold shoulder, she felt he’d retaliated againsther, spreading negative rumors in the office."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 56: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter056]ZDOROVIE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter056]The complaint that prompted Lauer’s firing ended in the same way—with a payout,and a nondisclosure agreement. When we first spoke, Brooke Nevils, the unnamedcolleague whose story NBC leadership and the press had deemed a consensualaffair, doubted she’d ever be able to go public. As I stepped out of hard raininto her New York apartment, she kept an eye over my shoulder until she lockedus in. “I just live in terror,” she said. “And after your story about the spies,I got even more scared. I knew who I was up against. And the shady shit theydid.”She was in her early thirties, but with a gangly, adolescent quality. “Tall,awkward, and flat-chested,” she said with a laugh. In her apartment, art andbooks were everywhere. As in a Murakami novel, cats were everywhere. Nevils hadsix, until that morning, when one had to be put down due to kidney failure.She told me this with the affectless delivery of someone who had been throughtoo much. Over the course of the past two years, Nevils had attempted suicide.She’d been hospitalized for post-traumatic stress disorder, descended into heavydrinking, pulled herself back. She’d lost fourteen pounds, and gone to doctorstwenty-one times in a single ten-month period. “I’ve lost everything I caredabout,” she said. “My job. My goals.”Nevils was raised in the suburbs of Chesterfield, Missouri. Grade-school reportcards said she spoke up a lot, smiled a lot, had a sharp sense of humor. Her dadwas a Marine in Vietnam, earned a PhD in marketing, and became a civiliancontractor for the Pentagon. Her mother, a TWA flight attendant, died of a heartattack a little over a year before our meeting. Nevils told me that her motherwas “just that kind of a person that wanted the world to be better.”Nevils had wanted to be a journalist since she was thirteen and learned thatHemingway wrote for the Kansas City Star. “You go into journalism because youbelieve in the truth. That people’s stories matter.” She frowned. Rain drummedat the windows. “I believed we were the good guys.” After college at JohnsHopkins, she interned at a few newspapers. In 2008, she got her dream job as anNBC page—the network’s career development program. Over the following years, sheworked her way up from giving tours to helping with big stories and staffing bigstars.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]In 2014, she was doing just that, working for Meredith Vieira—a personal hero ofhers, on whose career she hoped to model her own. When Vieira got tapped tocover the Olympics in 2014, the two headed off to Sochi, a coastal resort cityin Russia. At the end of one of their long work days, Vieira and Nevils hit thebar at the luxury hotel where the NBC team was staying. They laughed andgossiped over martinis. It was late, midnight maybe, when Lauer walked in andscanned the bar for familiar faces. “I had always been so intimidated by him. Hereally was kind of a bully at work. Had we not been in such a happy mood…” Shetrailed off. But the women were in a happy mood. And they’d been drinking. Shepatted the low seat next to her, invited Lauer to join.Sitting down next to her, Lauer surveyed the martinis and said: “You know, whatI really like is a nice cold vodka.” He ordered shots of Beluga vodka. Nevilshad six. “Na zdorovie!” Lauer cried—literally, to health. When Lauer took outhis iPhone and started snapping pictures, Nevils felt some worry seep into thefun. Lauer was known for jokingly putting after-hours photos of colleagues onair, part of the prankster culture he presided over at Today. Nevils felt drunk,and worried she looked it in the photos.After they parted ways—Lauer to his room, the women to theirs, higher up in thehotel—Vieira grinned and produced Lauer’s official press credential that grantedhim access to the events they were covering. Vieira and Lauer had a teasing,sibling-like rapport. This was the latest in a long history of mutual pranks.The women called Lauer and asked, between fits of tipsy laughter, if he wasmissing anything. Nevils recalled Lauer asking if she had looked for hercredential lately. He had it.Nevils went to Lauer’s room, a massive suite with wide views of the Black Sea,to retrieve her credential. She found him still professionally attired, and thetwo had an uneventful exchange about the credential heist. Nevils noticed hisfancy stationery, with “Matthew Todd Lauer” in raised navy ink, and thoughtabout scrawling “sucks” underneath as another drunk prank, but decided againstit. Lauer was at times formal and high-handed with junior staff like her. She’dbeen watching him on television since she was thirteen years old. She worriedshe’d get in trouble.Nevils went back upstairs and, as she and Vieira said their good nights, textedone to Lauer, too, with a joking reference to the trouble the women were havingdrunkenly fitting their key cards into their doors. A few minutes later, asNevils was brushing her teeth, her work BlackBerry buzzed. A message fromLauer’s work email suggested that she should come back downstairs. She repliedthat she’d only come if she could delete the photos of her looking drunk at thebar. He told her the offer expired in ten minutes. Later, sources close to Lauertold me that he considered her concern about the photos to be a thin pretext,and her messages to be come-ons. Nevils said that she found the idea of flirtingwith Lauer unthinkable. She had intended the messages to be playful, in linewith his rapport with her and Vieira throughout the night. In retrospect, sheconsidered going into a man’s room at night, by herself, unwise. She said thatshe was drunk, didn’t consider the implications deeply, and had no reason tosuspect Lauer would be anything but friendly based on prior experience. “Healways treated me like a little sister,” she said. “I had been to his room manytimes.” She didn’t put herself together before heading down. She was stilldressed for work, in maroon jeans from Uniqlo, a baggy green sweater fromTarget, and one of the Nike Sochi Olympics jackets that had been handed out toNBC staff. She hadn’t shaved her legs for weeks. She said that she assumed she’dbe right back up.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]In her apartment, years later, Nevils tried not to cry, and did so anyway. “I dothis PTSD therapy, right? Every week, a different thing messes me up. I just getso angry how this one thing derailed my life.”When Nevils arrived at his door, Lauer had changed into a tee shirt and boxers.As he pushed her against the door and began to kiss her, she became aware of howdrunk she was. She recalled the room spinning. “I thought I was going to throwup,” she said. “I kept thinking, I’m gonna throw up on Matt Lauer.” She saidthat she felt acutely embarrassed about her baggy clothes and unshaved legs.She recalled Lauer pushing her onto the bed, flipping her over, and asking ifshe liked anal sex. She said that she declined several times, replying, at onepoint, “No, that’s not my thing.” Nevils said that she was still in the midst oftelling him she wasn’t interested when he “just did it.” Lauer, she said, didn’tuse lubricant. The encounter was excruciatingly painful. “It hurt so bad. Iremember thinking, Is this normal?” She told me that she stopped saying no, butwept silently into a pillow.After Lauer finished, Nevils recalled him asking if she liked it.“Yes,” she said, mechanically. She felt humiliated and in pain. She told himthat she needed to delete the drunk photos of her, and he gave her his phone tolet her do so.“Did you tell Meredith anything?” she remembered him asking.“No,” she said.“Don’t,” he told her. Nevils wondered if it was advice or a warning.Back in her room, she threw up. She took off her pants, passed out. When shewoke up, blood was everywhere, soaked through her underwear, soaked through hersheets. “It hurt to walk, it hurt to sit.” She was afraid to google the problemon her work devices. Later, she was afraid to get tested for sexuallytransmitted diseases—what would her boyfriend of five years say? She bled fordays.Nevils said that, regardless of Lauer’s interpretation of their exchanges beforeand after, what transpired in his room was not consensual. “It was nonconsensualin the sense that I was too drunk to consent,” she said. “It was nonconsensualin that I said, multiple times, that I didn’t want to have anal sex.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The next day, Lauer emailed her a joke about her not writing or calling. Nevilstold him everything was fine. She told me that she was terrified she’d angeredhim, a concern that deepened as he appeared to ignore her for the remainder ofthe trip. When she finally worked up the nerve to call him, he said they couldtalk back in New York.On their return, she said that Lauer would ask her to his palatial Upper EastSide apartment, where they had two sexual encounters, and to his office, wherethey had more. Sources close to Lauer emphasized that she sometimes initiatedcontact. What is not in dispute is that Nevils, like several of the women I’dspoken to, had several further sexual encounters with the man she said assaultedher. “This is the thing I blame myself most for,” she said. “It was completelytransactional. It was not a relationship.” Nevils told friends at the time thatshe felt trapped. Lauer’s position of authority—over both her and her boyfriend,whose brother worked for Lauer—made her feel unable to say no. She said that, inthe first weeks after the alleged assault, she attempted to convey that she wascomfortable and even enthusiastic about the encounters. She even tried toconvince herself of the same. She readily admitted that her communications withLauer might have appeared friendly and obliging.But she also said she lived in terror of Lauer jeopardizing her career and thatthe encounters caused anguish and shame that eventually prompted her to break upwith her boyfriend. She said that she successfully avoided the encounters forseveral months. But ultimately, she found she had to interact with Lauer forprofessional reasons. In September 2014, when Vieira was decorating her talkshow set with photos from colleagues, Lauer’s assistant told Nevils to come toLauer to collect his pictures. At 9:30 a.m., in the little secondary office overthe Today show studio where he and I had sometimes met, he pointed at anelectronic photo frame Savannah Guthrie had given him, set on a deep ledge infront of the window. “It’s on there,” he told her. She had to bend over theledge to reach it. She said that, as she shuffled through the photos and emailedthem to herself, he grabbed her hips and fingered her. She told me that she wasjust trying to do her job. “I just went numb. In my internal narrative I failedbecause I didn’t say no.” Nevils bruises easily. Lauer left dark purple markswhere he’d forced her legs open. Crying, she ran to the new guy she’d startedseeing, a producer who was working in the control room that morning, and toldhim what had happened.That November, she volunteered to put together a goodbye video for herex-boyfriend, who was leaving a job at the network. Such videos were a commongesture for departing employees, and usually featured well-wishes from talent.When she asked Lauer for his, he told her to come to his office to record itherself. When she arrived, she said, he told her to go down on him. “I wasreally upset. I felt terrible,” she told me. “I was trying to do this nicething, and I had to give Matt a blow job to get him to film a goodbye video. Ijust felt sick.” She recalled asking, “Why do you do this?” and Lauer replying,“Because it’s fun.”The sexual encounters stopped after that. She said that once, a month later, asshe was grappling with depression and felt fearful about where she stood withhim, she sent him a text asking if he was in New York. He replied saying he wasnot.Nevils told “like a million people” about Lauer. She told her inner circle offriends. She told colleagues and superiors at NBC. As in so many of the storiesI’d reported on, Nevils told some of them a partial story, skipping over somedetails. But she was never inconsistent, and she made the seriousness of whathad happened clear. When she moved to a new job within the company, working as aproducer for Peacock Productions, she reported it to one of her new bossesthere. She felt they should know, in case it became public and she became aliability. This was no secret.And then, for several years, nothing happened. She didn’t know about the patternof harassment allegations within the company, or the payouts and otherappeasements that had concealed them. She didn’t know that control of PeacockProductions, specifically, had once been handed over to Corvo’s accuser.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]“If the Weinstein accusers hadn’t talked to you, I never would have said aword,” Nevils told me. “I saw myself in those stories. And when you see theworst part of your life in the pages of The New Yorker, it changes your life.”As the momentum around the Weinstein story accelerated, colleagues startedasking Nevils questions about Lauer. Over drinks, one Today show colleagueinquired about how much Nevils appeared to have changed. Nevils, previously asconfident and outspoken as her grade-school report cards had projected, hadwithdrawn. She’d passed up work opportunities, fearing her experiences withLauer would come up if she stuck her neck out. She started drinking heavily.After years of orienting her life around long-term committed relationships, shefell in and out of them.Nevils told the Today show colleague everything. “This is not your fault,”Nevils remembered the colleague saying, bursting into tears. “And trust me,you’re not alone.” The colleague had her own experience with Lauer, andprofessional fallout from it afterward. The colleague told Nevils she had totell Vieira. And soon Nevils was at Vieira’s apartment, recounting the wholestory again. “It’s Matt, isn’t it?” Vieira asked, at the outset of theconversation. “I was thinking about it and he was the only one who had enoughpower over you to do that.” Vieira was distraught. She blamed herself for notdoing more to protect Nevils, and feared there were more victims. “Think of allthe other women I’ve gotten jobs there,” Vieira said. Nevils just keptapologizing.Both women knew how far the network would go to shield its top talent. ButNevils felt she had to do something to protect other women. Vieira said if shewas going to do anything, she should file a formal report with NBC’s office ofhuman resources. And that’s how, in November 2017, Nevils found a lawyer, andwound up sitting with him opposite two women from NBCUniversal, telling thewhole story.She asked for, and was promised, anonymity. But she left out nothing. Shedisclosed the ongoing contact afterward but made it clear it was no affair. Shedescribed the incident in detail, making it clear that she’d been too drunk toconsent and that she’d said no to Lauer’s request for anal sex repeatedly. Shewas still early in her process of reliving the trauma—she didn’t use the word“rape” that day. But she described one, unambiguously. Her attorney, AriWilkenfeld, paused the proceedings at one point to reiterate that theinteraction was not consensual. One of the representatives from NBC replied thatthey understood, though later the network would say that it had reached noofficial conclusion on the matter. Stephanie Franco, the NBCUniversal lawyer whohad placed the call reminding Lonner’s attorney of the enforceability of hersettlement, was present for the meeting.At work a few days later, when Nevils learned that Lack and Oppenheim wereemphasizing that the incident hadn’t been “criminal” or an “assault,” she lefther desk, walked to the nearest bathroom, and threw up. Her distress deepened asarticles to which NBC’s communications team contributed began labeling theincident an “affair.” Angry letters began flooding her attorney’s office. “Shameon you for throwing your cunt at a married man,” read one.Nevils’s work life became torture. She was made to sit in the same meetings aseveryone else, discussing the news, and in all of them, colleagues loyal toLauer cast doubt on the claims, and judgment on her. In a Dateline staffmeeting, Lester Holt asked skeptically, “Does the punishment fit the crime?”Soon, colleagues were averting their eyes in the hallways. After the itemscharacterizing the relationship as an affair, her boyfriend at the time becamesharply less supportive, asking her, “How could you?” NBC management had turnedher into a pariah. “You need to know that I was raped,” she told a friend. “AndNBC lied about it.”The network appeared to be doing little to protect Nevils’s identity. Lackannounced that the incident had taken place in Sochi, narrowing the potentialcomplainants to a small group of women on that trip with close proximity toLauer. A member of the communications staff identified Nevils by name inconversations with colleagues. Sources familiar with the matter later said thatKornblau had warned that member of his team not to do so. Wilkenfeld publiclyaccused NBC of outing Nevils. “They know exactly what they’ve done and they needto stop,” he said.Nevils hadn’t initially asked for money. She’d wanted to do right by otherwomen, then carry on with a job she loved. But as public scrutiny of the storyand of Nevils mounted, NBC offered her one year’s salary to depart and sign anondisclosure agreement. Nevils felt her reputation had been damaged. She wasgrappling with losing both the job she loved and the possibility of findingfuture employment. She threatened to sue the network, and a protracted andpunishing negotiation commenced. Sources familiar with the talks said thatlawyers working with the network argued that Nevils’s distress flowed from hermother’s death and was unrelated to the alleged assault. In the end, her lawyertold her not to mention grief to her therapist, fearing NBC might subpoena hertherapy records. The network would later deny that it made the threat or raisedher mother’s death. As the negotiations stretched over the course of 2018,Nevils took medical leave. Eventually, she was hospitalized for post-traumaticstress and alcohol abuse.In the end, NBC wanted the problem gone. It offered Nevils a growing settlementsum—seven figures, finally, in exchange for her silence. The network proposed ascript she would have to read, suggesting that she had left to pursue otherendeavors, that she was treated well, and that NBC News was a positive exampleof how to handle sexual harassment. The sources familiar with the talks saidthat the network initially sought to include a clause that would have preventedNevils from talking to other Lauer accusers, but Nevils pushed back. The networklater denied they’d pressed for the provision.Lawyers closed ranks and pushed Nevils to take the offer, as they had withGutierrez and so many other women. For Comcast, the sum was a rounding error.For Nevils, it was a matter of survival. She surveyed the professional futureshe had lost, and the damage she felt the network had done to her reputation,and felt she didn’t have a choice. NBC took the extraordinary step of having notonly Nevils but also her lawyer and others close to her sign away their right toever speak about the network."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 57: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter057]SPIKE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter057]The allegations about Lauer weren’t the only ones emerging. From the first daysafter the Weinstein story broke, NBC had been buffeted by allegations about menin its upper echelons. Shortly after the first New Yorker story about Weinstein,the network fired Mark Halperin, MSNBC and NBC News’s most prominent politicalanalyst, after five women told CNN he had been harassing or assaulting women inthe workplace—grabbing, exposing himself, rubbing an erection against onewoman—dating back to his days at ABC more than a decade earlier.Days later, NBC fired Matt Zimmerman, the senior vice president of booking atthe Today show and a close confidant of Lauer’s, for sleeping with twounderlings. Less than a month after the Lauer story broke, multiple outletsreported that the network had paid an assistant producer $40,000 in 1999, aftershe raised a verbal harassment allegation against Chris Matthews, one of MSNBC’sbiggest stars.More news followed. There had been the large-scale payout to David Corvo’saccuser during his involvement in the Weinstein story. And there was a morestartling claim that shook me personally: three women had accused Tom Brokaw ofunwanted advances, many years earlier. These weren’t claims of assault. Butcoworkers, at times young ones, beginning their careers, as he was at the apexof his, said he’d propositioned them and that they’d felt frightened. Brokaw wasfurious, heartbroken, denied it all.Practically alone among the prominent figures of NBC News, Brokaw had objectedto the killing of the Weinstein story. He’d told me how he’d protested to thenetwork’s leadership. In one email to me, he called the killing of the story“NBC’s self inflicted wound.” But both things could be true. Tom Brokaw, aprincipled defender of a tough story, had also once been part of a network newsculture that made women feel uncomfortable and unsafe, and left little room foraccountability around its larger-than-life stars.Six, and then twelve, and then dozens of current and former employees gave me asimilar account of a permissive atmosphere when it came to harassment byprominent men at the network. Several of the employees said that they believedthe years-long pattern of settlements had allowed the behavior to continue. Somesaid that the problems had deepened under Andy Lack’s leadership. When Lackbegan his first tenure as president of NBC News, in the nineties, “it was afundamental shift of, all of a sudden, a tolerance for abusive behavior, whetherit was sexually harassing or it was just verbally abusive,” Linda Vester, whoraised the first complaint about Brokaw, told me. “Degrading, humiliating talk,mainly to women. And that became the climate under Andy Lack. It was just—it wasvery stark.”All of the employees said that they were concerned about the effect the patternof complaints and settlements had on the network’s coverage. That knock-oneffect, said Vester, was one of Lack’s trademarks. “He would spike stories aboutwomen,” she told me. “And this happened routinely.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]NBC was embattled. Over the course of 2018, investigative stories in theWashington Post, Esquire, and the Daily Beast described a culture of harassmentat the network. As the Post prepared to report that Ann Curry had told NBCexecutives about Lauer sexually harassing women, Stephanie Franco, the sameNBCUniversal employment attorney who had attended the meeting with Nevils,called Curry. Franco, as Curry recalled the conversation, wanted to know whatshe was telling the press. “It was really a call to try to intimidate me,” Currysaid. “That was my impression.” Dismayed at what she took to be a focus onsilencing her rather than addressing the sexual harassment problem at thenetwork, she became direct. “You need to be taking care of these women,” Currytold Franco. “This is your job. You should be making sure these women areprotected from this guy.”“I try to do that when they let me do it,” Franco said. Later, the internalreport on Lauer would cite the call to Curry as part of its research. Curry saidFranco made no mention of a report, and asked no questions about sexualharassment at the network.Several of the current and former employees recalled other instances in whichthe network appeared to be working to forestall disclosures. In one case, NBChired as a paid contributor a reporter who had, until just before the hiring,been making calls to women at the network, inquiring about harassment. One ofthe women the reporter had contacted texted me: “Coverup.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]No publication had circled the sexual harassment claims at the network, and theallegations against Lauer, more closely than the National Enquirer. Over theyears, the tabloid had pursued Lauer’s accusers. In 2006, when Addie Collins wasworking as a local anchor in West Virginia, she came home to a stakeout: areporter from the Enquirer approached, peppering her with questions about Lauer.After his firing, the tabloid focused on Nevils, whose name was not yet public.It was her résumé that had been attached to internal emails at AMI that I laterreviewed. Soon after she registered her complaint, the Enquirer began callingNevils’s colleagues and, eventually, Nevils herself.In May 2018, after the meeting in which Oppenheim and Harris tried to explainthe internal investigation of Lauer to a skeptical investigative unit, WilliamArkin, one respected member of that unit, called me, troubled. He said that twosources, one connected to Lauer, the other within NBC, had told him thatWeinstein had made it known to the network that he was aware of Lauer’s behaviorand capable of revealing it. Two sources at AMI later told me they’d heard thesame thing. NBC denied any threat was communicated.But there was no doubt that the allegations against Lauer, and NBC’s wider useof nondisclosure agreements with women who experienced harassment, were underthreat of exposure during our reporting. That precarious culture of secrecy madeNBC more vulnerable to Harvey Weinstein’s intimidation and enticement, deliveredthrough lawyers, and intermediaries, and calls to Lack and Griffin and Oppenheimand Roberts and Meyer that the network initially concealed. That pattern ofnondisclosure agreements and ongoing threats to enforce them was playing out asthe network acquiesced to Weinstein’s argument that his own similar pacts wereironclad and couldn’t be reported on. And, as Weinstein huddled with DylanHoward, all these secrets had been under threat. The Enquirer had pulled Lauer’sfile, and called one NBC employee after another with questions about him, andbegun to run articles that threatened the future of the star anchor, who hadbecome synonymous with the network’s value."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 58: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter058]LAUNDER [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter058]Rich McHugh spent the year grappling with fallout from the story, too. In hismeeting with Oppenheim, he’d declined to yield to the network president’scharacterizations of the reporting, and watched Oppenheim grow agitated andcurse at him, and wondered what the implications would be for his future. As hecontinued to speak up in the group meetings, McHugh said, “I was basically puton watch.” HR began to call, offering him a raise to stay and—he felt this,after the meeting with Oppenheim—sign onto the party line. On the other hand,the network reminded him that his contract was about to run out.“No one knows my name,” he told me, sitting at the corner diner near my place onthe Upper West Side. “They can say whatever they want about me. They can keep mefrom getting a job.”“Do what’s best for your girls,” I said.McHugh shook his head. “I don’t know if I can.” Bringing up the family was nouse—it was the man’s conscientiousness about the world his daughters werestepping into that had prompted these fits of principle in the first place.In the end, he decided he couldn’t take the money. “I sat in the meetings whilethey lied to the rest of the people,” McHugh said. “Had to bite my tongue. Andthen decided not to.”A year after he was ordered to stand down on the Weinstein reporting, McHughresigned. Then he gave an interview to the New York Times, saying that thereporting had been killed at “the very highest levels of NBC,” that he’d beenordered to stop taking calls about the story, and that the network had liedabout what happened.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Mark Kornblau and the NBC News public relations machine went apoplectic. Lack,resisting calls for independent review as he had in Lauer’s case, released tothe press another self-report. I sat in one of the glassed-in offices at The NewYorker, and read his memo, and wasn’t sure what to make of it. Later, thenetwork would acknowledge that it had conducted no fact-checking on the memo.Within hours of its release, many of the sources discussed in it had made publicstatements disputing its contents.“Farrow never had a victim or witness willing to be identified,” the memo saidrepeatedly. This was not true of any point in the life span of the story at NBC.“Ambra had always been willing to allow Farrow to identify her by name and usethe recording of her, and I had filmed an interview in silhouette,” Nestor wrotein a furious statement she released to the press shortly after the Lack memowent out. “After Rose McGowan pulled out of the story, realizing that the storywas in peril of not being made public at all, Farrow and I discussed and I hadtentatively offered either to attach my name to the interview in silhouette orpotentially even reshoot the interview with my face visible. However, they werenot interested in this interview.” Gutierrez added: “I was as available to Ronanbefore he left nbc as I was after he left. Nothing about me has ever waivered.”Rose McGowan gave a statement to Megyn Kelly’s program, reiterating that she’dbeen on the record for months.The memo contained a long tract in which Lack and the communications teamattempted to undercut and dismantle the credibility of the sources. Theydismissed Abby Ex’s recollections of Weinstein’s meetings designed for sexualentrapment by saying that “her account was based on suspicion alone.” Ex, too,released a statement saying this wasn’t true. “That is factually incorrect,” shewrote. “Harvey asked ME, many times, to join these meetings, to which I refused.But I was a witness to them, and in fact, was a first-hand witness to physicaland verbal abuse at his hands as well, all of which Ronan has on camera from myinterview.” The memo suggested that Dennis Rice, the marketing executive, hadn’tbeen referring to Weinstein and that my use of his quotes had been misleading.In fact, Rice’s statements had been designed to give him plausible deniabilityin the event that he faced retaliation, and he’d approved of how his quotes wereused. Rice told a reporter that McHugh and I “didn’t take anything out ofcontext. I always knew what I was saying on camera would end up in a story aboutHarvey.” The New Yorker had later used these accounts without incident.Lack’s memo was a “misleading and incorrect account,” Ex wrote, expressingbewilderment at the network’s effort to attack and expose sources withoutconsulting them. “To see this memo leaked to the press with the sources listed,even without our names, and without the full and honest picture of thereporting, feels like the opposite of honest and direct.”The memo copped—for the first time, contradicting earlier communiqués to thepress—to Weinstein’s “numerous” calls and emails to Lack, Griffin, andOppenheim. It painted a portrait of those conversations at odds with the recordsI’d later uncover, and the accounts of those who had stayed on the line whilethey played out. It made no mention of Griffin’s assurances to Weinstein, or ofthe warm rapport implied by a bottle of Grey Goose.Several investigative reporters at the network said they found the memo’s focuson picking apart the work-in-progress reporting baffling. A number of televisionjournalists I consulted agreed that the audio, in and of itself, was worthy ofair. But McHugh and I hadn’t argued that the story was finalized at NBC, or thatit didn’t have room to grow and come to fuller fruition, as it did in just a fewweeks at The New Yorker. The problem, rather, was that we received a hard orderto stop that development. Lack’s memo made no mention of Greenberg ordering meto cancel an interview, blaming Oppenheim. It omitted McHugh being told to standdown, and Oppenheim being the first to suggest sending the reporting out thedoor to a print outlet. “It’s immaterial,” one veteran correspondent recalledtelling Oppenheim and Greenberg, in response to their protestations about howmuch we’d had. “I know what it looks like when we’re trying to bring a story toair and I know what it looks like when we’re not.” The correspondent said that“privately, the internal narrative is, we blew it.”The memo was greeted with similar skepticism in the press. On the network’s ownair, Megyn Kelly questioned NBC’s self-reporting, joining the calls forindependent oversight. Soon she’d be gone, too—fired after another conflagrationover a racially insensitive remark. For the network, the firing had the addedbenefit of cutting off what several sources around Lack said were mountingtensions over Kelly’s focus on Weinstein and Lauer.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The memo was only one in a series of steps designed to rewrite the history ofthe story at the network. NBC also hired Ed Sussman, a “Wikipedia whitewasher,”to unbraid references to Oppenheim, Weinstein, and Lauer on the crowdsourcedencyclopedia. The Lauer matter, Sussman wrote, justifying one edit, “should behandled seperately.” He spun the material in NBC’s favor, sometimes weaving inerrors. In one edit, he proposed that the month between the Weinstein storybeing greenlit and running at The New Yorker be revised to “several months.”Other times, he simply removed all mention of the controversies.“This is one of the most blatant and naked exercises of hard corporate spin thatI have encountered in WP and I have encountered a lot,” one veteran Wikipediaeditor complained. But Sussman often prevailed: he reasserted his changes againand again, with a doggedness that unpaid editors could not match. And hedeployed a network of friendly accounts to launder his changes and make surethey stuck. Several Wikipedia pages, including Oppenheim’s, were stripped ofevidence of the killing of the Weinstein story. It was almost as if it had neverhappened."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 59: [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter059]BLACKLIST [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter059]After the first New Yorker story, I faced a dilemma similar to McHugh’s. For atime, I did as I’d uneasily promised during the argument with Oppenheim andKornblau, and dodged questions about the story’s history at NBC. On CBS, StephenColbert looked at me narrowly as I said I didn’t want the story to be about meand changed the subject. “Part of this story is the story not being told for solong,” he said. “And you experienced the story not being told.”My sister called at the height of the evasive interviews. “You’re covering forthem,” she said.“I’m not lying,” I replied.“No. You’re omitting. It’s dishonest.”The low points between us flickered back to me. I remembered the hard years,after I’d told her to shut up about her own allegation: walking into her roomafter she came back from the hospital; seeing her pull a long sleeve over theladder of blood-red em-dashes on her forearm; saying I was sorry, and that Iwished I could have done more.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]Throughout that fall, the network followed up on Oppenheim’s text dangling a newdeal. “You should counter however aggressively you need,” he added. Griffincalled my agents and said, “I’m his guy. What do we have to do?” Before theclaims about him surfaced, Brokaw emailed after my media appearances to tell me,“You’ve handled this perfectly. Now the future….” He called, saying the networkhad asked him to convince me to come back. “I realize the offer might have to beover the top, but you should consider it. It’s still a great place to dojournalism.” He said he felt confident the network would agree to a statementacknowledging what had gone wrong and a new set of guidelines to preventeditorial interference. I still just wanted my job back. And I believed in thevalues NBC News represented at its best. I convinced myself that maybe thekilling of the Weinstein story was a one-off, not a sign of deeper ills. I saidI’d hear the network out, and told my agents the same.But with McHugh’s refusals to compromise, and with each source who called toallege a pattern of harassment and settlements at the network, it got harder togo along to get along. From the early days after the Weinstein story broke, I’dbeen talking to a group of sources who described serial misconduct at CBS: anexecutive who was said to sleep with underlings and harass and assault others; apattern of payouts to silence women; dozens of employees describing how thecover-up was distorting a news outlet’s priorities. In the end, I didn’t think Icould report out the allegations against Leslie Moonves and the other CBSexecutives while shutting up about the pervasive claims streaming out of 30Rockefeller Plaza.I told my agents to drop negotiations.The reprisal was decisive. With each of the AMI stories over the followingmonths, I was invited to appear on MSNBC and NBC shows at all hours—and then,suddenly, uninvited. On-air personalities called upset, one near tears, to sayI’d been unbooked over their objections, on direct orders from Griffin. A seniorexecutive at the network later said Lack had issued an edict too. “These peopleare insidious,” one anchor wrote. “I’m so angry.” Then the executives werereaching out, saying they knew I had a book coming out—I’d managed to finish theforeign policy book I’d ignored for so long—and they’d be happy to considerhaving me back on air to promote it, if I’d come in and reach a formal agreementabout not rehashing the past. I called Maddow, who listened, and said no onetells her how to run her show. And so it came to pass that, all through the twoyears after the Weinstein story, I appeared on her show, and never again on anyother NBC or MSNBC program. Later, as I finished work on this book, NBC’slitigation department began contacting the publisher, Hachette.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The last conversation I had with Noah Oppenheim in the aftermath of the storywas a call he made. I spoke to him while pacing the strange safe house inChelsea, Jonathan listening in the background. “I’ve become the poster boy forthis,” Oppenheim told me. The backfire from his and Kornblau’s dissemblingstatements to media reporters had flared into the political zeitgeist. On FoxNews a few days earlier, Tucker Carlson had sat in front of a picture ofOppenheim and called for his resignation. “Let’s be clear. NBC is lying,”Carlson said. “Many powerful people knew what Harvey Weinstein was doing and notonly ignored his crimes but actively took his side against his many victims.It’s a long list but at the very top of that list is NBC News.” He appeared torelish the chance to attack a mainstream outlet, Hollywood liberals, and asexual predator all at once. “News executives are not allowed to tell lies,” hesaid, as if he’d never met one.As I paced, Oppenheim said, “You know, I just got a call this morning from NBCGlobal Security saying they need to send a police car to my house because of allthe online death threats.” He sounded angry, not afraid. “I’ve got three youngkids who are wondering why there are cops out front.” I said I was sorry to hearit. I meant it.“Even if you think that NBC was either cowardly or acted inappropriately orwhatever, which you’re entitled to feel, I hope that you would realize the waythis has become personalized and hung on me is not fair or accurate,” he added.“Even if you believe that there is a villain in this, that the villain is notme.”He was agitated, talking over me. Everyone, it seemed, had some culpability forhis predicament except him. When I told him media reporters were telling metheir criticism was a result of Kornblau’s blanketing the press with falseclaims, he wailed: “Kornblau works for Andy! He works for the news group! Hedoesn’t work for me! He doesn’t work for me!” And then: “I can’t tell him whatto do. I can try and I have tried.” When he said he’d never threatened me, Ireminded him that Susan Weiner had explicitly done so, on his orders. Heshouted: “Susan Weiner is Andy’s lawyer! These are not people who work for me!”Later, others involved disputed that characterization of Oppenheim’s authorityas president of NBC News.“You keep saying you’re the one who takes the hit and it wasn’t you. So wheredoes it come from?” I asked finally.“My boss! Okay? I have a boss. I don’t run NBC News exclusively,” he said, thenseemed to catch himself. “You know, everyone was involved in this decision. Youcan speculate what Kim Harris’s motives are, you can speculate what Andy’smotives are, you can speculate what my motives are. All I can tell you is at theend of the day, they felt like, you know, there was a consensus about theorganization’s comfort level moving forward.”He reminded me, twice, that he’d revived my career after my show was canceled.That we’d been friends. He hoped we could get a beer and laugh about it all in afew months. I struggled to understand what he was asking for. Gradually, he letit out. “I’m just making a plea,” he said. “If the opportunity ever does presentitself to you to say that maybe I’m not the villain in all this, I would begrateful.”And there it was, at the end of his arguments: an unwillingness not just to takeresponsibility but to admit that responsibility might, in some place, insomeone’s hands, exist. It was a consensus about the organization’s comfortlevel moving forward that stopped the reporting. It was a consensus about theorganization’s comfort level moving forward that bowed to lawyers and threats;that hemmed and hawed and parsed and shrugged; that sat on multiple credibleallegations of sexual misconduct and disregarded a recorded admission of guilt.That anodyne phrase, that language of indifference without ownership, upheld somuch silence in so many places. It was a consensus about the organization’scomfort level moving forward that protected Harvey Weinstein and men like him;that yawned and gaped and enveloped law firms and PR shops and executive suitesand industries; that swallowed women whole.Noah Oppenheim was not the villain.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]“I do not think you will be getting a beer with Noah Oppenheim in a few months,”Jonathan deadpanned later. It was a sunlit afternoon, back at his place in LosAngeles.“No more morning TV, I guess,” I replied. I was, increasingly, realizing I’d bespending the next year chasing leads about CBS and NBC.“I’ll take care of you, baby,” he said. “I’ll keep you in finery and smoothies.”He hugged me around the middle like a kid hugging a stuffed animal. I laughed,put a hand on his. It had been a long year, for me and for us, but we hung inthere.Later, when I decided some of that reporting would make its way into a book, I’dsend him a draft, and put in a question, right on this page: “Marriage?” On themoon or even here on earth. He read the draft, and found the proposal here, andsaid, “Sure.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]The first time I saw my sister Dylan after the stories began to break, she gaveme a hug, too. We were at her cottage in the countryside, near my mother andseveral other siblings, under a blanket of snow—a universe apart from thetempest of unfolding reporting. Dylan’s two-year-old daughter, looking uncannilylike her mother—wearing one of her mother’s old onesies even—cooed forsomething, waving her arms. My sister handed her a pacifier with a littlestuffed monkey attached to it, and we watched her bound off on wobbly legs.I shuffled through mental images of Dylan and me during our own onesie years,and those that followed: dressed up for school plays, waiting for the bus,constructing a magic kingdom together that no one could touch. I remembered us,as we positioned those pewter kings and dragons, and a grown-up voice sounded,calling her away. Her startled look, too frightened. Her asking, if anything badever happened to her, whether I’d be there. And me making a promise.In the countryside with her daughter running around, she told me she was proudof the reporting. She was grateful for it. And here she trailed off.“No story for you,” I said. When she’d spoken, as a child and again severalyears before all of this, she felt people had looked the other way.“Right,” she replied.It was a time of newfound accountability. But for every story being heard,countless others weren’t. Dylan was frustrated. She, like many of the sourceswho had suffered at the hands of the unaccountably powerful and whose storiesnow filled my in-box, was angry. And not long after, she joined the others—inindustry after industry—and told the world she was frustrated too. She invited aTV crew into the cottage in the countryside, and they made the place as brightas an operating room. A news anchor beckoned her over, and Dylan took a deepbreath, and stepped into the light—and this time, people were listening.[images/Art_sborn.jpg]It was dusk when I filed into David Remnick’s office at The New Yorker. I foundhim flipping through a document. “Oh!” I said, reddening a little. “That was forme.” I’d asked a colleague to print it and leave it for me to pick up. Notes,not a handout. Remnick’s assistant had brought it over to him instead.“It’s interesting,” he said. A sly smile, a little mischief.We took seats near a big window with views of the Hudson. Remnick had beengracious, dispensing advice as I grappled with what to do next. He thought of meas a “TV guy,” perhaps a little too obsessed with seeing my face onscreen. Andmaybe I was. “You don’t want to keep doing this forever, do you?” he asked,gesturing toward the magazine’s offices around us. But I realized I did.I pointed at the notes. The next wave of potential stories. Some were aboutsexual violence. There was the developing reporting around New York AttorneyGeneral Eric Schneiderman, about whom New Yorker writer Jane Mayer and I wouldeventually publish four allegations of physical abuse, prompting him to stepdown. There was the investigation into CBS, which would swell to include twelveclaims of assault and harassment against Leslie Moonves, prompting hisresignation—the first in this new era by a Fortune 500 CEO over such claims—aswell as changes within CBS’s board and news division. Other leads were aboutdifferent forms of corruption: waste and fraud and cover-ups in media andgovernment. Some you have seen, some you have not.He looked at the document again, handed it back to me.“Too much?” I asked. Outside of the window next to us, the sky was changing.Remnick looked at me. “I was going to say we have our work cut out for us.”[images/Art_sborn.jpg]In the months that followed, I wasn’t sure those plans would include the claimsabout harassment at NBC. At the network, everything was in its place: theWikipedia articles had been scrubbed; the self-reports declared definitive. Thepeople who would claim otherwise had been paid, and remained too frightened torisk their nondisclosure agreements. The men of NBC News had put in the lastword about Brooke Nevils, who had an affair, who hadn’t been assaulted, aboutwhom the company had known nothing.Only not quite. In early 2019, I returned to Nevils, and sat in her book-linedliving room again. This time, I brought Lavery, the New Yorker fact-checker.Afternoon light streamed through the windows. Cats, white and black and gray,encircled Nevils. Among them was a new kitten, taking the place of the one she’dlost before.Nevils was leafing through letters her late mother sent her. Meticulous notes,in dreaming, swooping cursive, a mother’s love for her daughter leaping off theyellowing pages. “My dearest darling daughter,” one read. “Each time a doorcloses, another opens.”Nevils felt she’d ruined her life by not shutting up. And she was increasinglyconvinced it was the right thing to do. “All the women before feel I am theirfault,” she said. “And if there were women after me, I feel that is my fault.”She told me she was willing to take another risk—to tell her story again, forthe sake of those women yet to come.As I prepared to leave, she looked me in the eye and repeated her answer to allmy questions about the network. “I am obliged to tell you that I cannotdisparage Andy Lack, or Noah Oppenheim, or any other employee of NBC News.”I nodded. As I watched, a smile just began to turn the edges of her lips.In the end, the courage of women can’t be stamped out. And stories—the big ones,the true ones—can be caught but never killed."},{"pageContent":"image [images/Art_P411.jpg]toc.xhtml#toc-chapter060"},{"pageContent":"Not long after the meeting with Nevils, Igor Ostrovskiy and I reunited at aFrench bistro on the Upper West Side. Sun fell through the window behind himover our little table. He looked exhausted, like he hadn’t slept in days. Iasked him what brought it all on, this crazy high-wire act of leakinginformation to me through the months.“I like to be able to read the news and not think somebody’s holding a gun tothe reporter’s head deciding what they write,” he said. “Coming from a societywhere the news was controlled by those in power, I never, ever want to allowthis to happen to the country that gave me and my wife and my son a chance.”Turns out, his wife had just had a baby. A first-generation American boy.“I happened to be at this intersection where we were following reporters whosestories I read, who I thought were doing something honest and good for society.If somebody wants to attack that, that’s attacking my country. That’s attackingmy home.”I studied him. How strange, this speech, from the man who spent a summerfollowing me, trying to stop my reporting.Once he’d refused to take the polygraph for Black Cube, the InfoTactic jobs hadstopped coming. Now he was hanging out his own shingle, Ostro Intelligence. He’dstill be a private investigator, but there’d be a public service angle, heannounced, proud and earnest, meaning it and wanting me to know he meant it.Maybe he could help groups like Citizen Lab. “Moving forward, I’m going to tryto be more involved with this kind of stuff, to better society, to seek outthese kind of actors, try to expose them,” he said. “You know, the press is asmuch part of our democracy as Congress or the executive branch or the judicialbranch. It has to keep things in check. And when the powerful control the press,or make the press useless, if the people can’t trust the press, the people lose.And the powerful can do what they want.”Ostrovskiy flicked through pictures on his phone, a far-off smile on his face. Amother, flushed and exhausted after birth. A new son coming home. A fatherimagining how good a man he could become for his family. A blue-gray cat withclever, lamplike eyes, peering wonderingly at the new arrival.The cat’s name, by the way, was Spy."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS [toc.xhtml#toc-acknowledgements]Catch and Kill was exhaustively vetted by Sean Lavery, a senior fact-checker atThe New Yorker, who has also worked on many of my investigations for themagazine. Without his steady judgment and lack of work-life balance, this bookwould not have been possible. Noor Ibrahim and Lindsay Gellman, my impeccableresearchers, put in long hours. The brilliant and tireless Unjin Lee managed andassisted that research team, counseled me during stressful low points, andperformed light countersurveillance duties. She is still planning to learn KravMaga.Little, Brown and Company supported this book through a protracted reporting andfact-checking process. Tough stories don’t get told without companies beingwilling to weather the storm. Thank you to Reagan Arthur, my wonderfulpublisher, and Michael Pietsch of Hachette Book Group. Thank you to VanessaMobley, the editor of every writer’s dreams and an unwavering ally in gettingthis book right. Thank you to Sabrina Callahan and Elizabeth Garriga for theirefforts defending the message of this book. I also depended on Mike Noon, ourhardworking production editor, on Janet Byrne, our meticulous copyeditor, and onGregg Kulick, our talented designer, who was collaborative and gracious about mybackseat driving. Liz McNamara of Davis Wright Tremaine and Carol Fein Ross ofHachette further defended the reporting with their legal vetting. And thelegendary Lynn Nesbit, my literary agent and dear friend, stood by me during thelong journey of the Weinstein story and through the writing of this book.I hope Catch and Kill serves as a tribute to other journalists I admire. Withouttheir labors, powerful people would never be held accountable. I am grateful,every day, for the peerless team at The New Yorker that rescued the Weinsteinstory and continues to stand behind one difficult investigation after another.I don’t know how to thank David Remnick. The fact that he did so right by thestories, and by me, changed my outlook on journalism and life. You know thatclip where Oprah Winfrey says of Gayle King, “She is the mother I never had. Sheis the sister everybody would want. She is the friend that everybody deserves. Idon’t know a better person”? That’s David Remnick. Esther Fein, a wonderfuljournalist and David Remnick’s wife, is impossibly kind. DeirdreFoley-Mendelssohn, my editor, is a singular talent with an unerring moralcompass. She is responsible for the voice of our New Yorker stories and somehowfound time to give exacting notes on this book through work and travel and apregnancy. David Rohde is my fearless collaborator. I find unconvincing hisclaims that he is not, as described in these pages, an angel. He and Michael Luohave both been important defenders of the reporting.Fabio Bertoni is a badass lawyer who approached the thorny legal challenges andthreats we faced with integrity and common sense. It’s easy for lawyers to sayno. The best media lawyers give advice on how to get to yes carefully andfairly. Natalie Raabe, The New Yorker’s head of communications, went to thebarricades to defend our stories against some pretty efficient spin machines.There are many others, including Peter Canby, the magazine’s head offact-checking, E. Tammy Kim, the checker who worked so diligently on the firstWeinstein story, along with Fergus McIntosh, who also helped me untangle BlackCube and AMI. Natalie Meade scrutinized follow-up stories. They all ensured thereporting was precise, accurate, and fair. Other senior editors at the magazine,including Pam McCarthy and Dorothy Wickenden, have been kind and generous. RogerAngell graciously, if unknowingly, allowed me to use his desk. I love The NewYorker—and the people there, who inspire me to be a better journalist.Thanks also to my bosses at HBO, including Richard Plepler, Casey Bloys, NancyAbraham, and Lisa Heller, who supported the reporting at every turn and stood byme through long months of book leave.I also owe a debt of gratitude to the many reporters and publications who helpedbreak ground relevant to this book. Thank you to the journalists who pursued theWeinstein story, and then shared their insights with me, when they didn’t knowme and didn’t have to but for their sense of principle. Ken Auletta is a princeamong men and the history of the Weinstein story would be different without hiswork. Ben Wallace was similarly generous. Janice Min and Matt Belloni and KimMasters were too. And admiration to Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, whose powerfulstories made me feel less alone and taught me to type faster.Thank you to the reporters who shed light on the AMI story, including JeffHorwitz and Jake Pearson of the Associated Press and Joe Palazzolo and MichaelRothfeld of the Wall Street Journal. Thank you to Shachar Alterman of Uvda, thedocumentarian Ella Alterman, Adam Ciralsky of Vanity Fair, Raphael Satter of theAssociated Press, John Scott-Railton of Citizen Lab, and Adam Entous, mycolleague at The New Yorker, for their help with the Black Cube reporting.Thank you to those who exposed allegations of abuse at NBC News, including RaminSetoodeh and Elizabeth Wagmeister of Variety, Sarah Ellison of the WashingtonPost, and Lachlan Cartwright of the Daily Beast—who doggedly pursued the patternof settlements.Thank you to the journalists and producers of NBC News who continue to chaseimportant stories and believe in the place’s promise and principles. Before theintercession of executives, the Weinstein story was well supported by RichMcHugh’s and my colleagues. I am so grateful to Anna Schechter, Tracy Connor,William Arkin, Cynthia McFadden, Stephanie Gosk, and many others on theinvestigative unit. Rachel Maddow was a voice of principle. Phoebe Curran, anassociate producer, helped conduct research in the story’s early days.Rich McHugh did the right thing, even when it was the worst thing for himself,every time. Without his fierce ethics and the sense of mission in his bones, notto mention the righteous indignation of his wife Danie, we would have been lost.He’s a hero and he lives in New Jersey.Most importantly, I thank the sources. I am inspired by those who exposedunethical and at times illegal conduct from the inside. Sleeper’s courage brokethrough a wall of lies and helped victims of deception and gaslighting. IgorOstrovskiy put principle and patriotism before self-protection at every turn,first by informing me, and then by agreeing to put his name in this book. Thankyou also to John Tye for supporting him in that process and for being helpful asI navigated my own security concerns. The list of conscientious objectorsincludes many employees of Miramax and the Weinstein Company, of NBC News andAMI, of the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, the NYPD, and the SouthernDistrict of New York. Most of them, I can’t name. A few to whom I owe a debt ofgratitude: Abby Ex, Dede Nickerson, Dennis Rice, and Irwin Reiter.I am especially grateful to the women who risked so much to reveal important anddifficult truths. Rosanna Arquette overcame her fears to help with the Weinsteinstory, then stayed in the fight, urging source after source to come forward. Shehas been indispensable to my follow-up stories about Weinstein, my investigationof CBS, and to other reporting that still hasn’t seen the light of day.Ambra Gutierrez is a source for the ages, with the courage of a jewel thief. Herstory in these pages speaks for itself. Emily Nestor is as compassionate andsteadfast a person as I’ve encountered. Before the story was a sure thing, shestood by it. And she’s continued to stand by it, in the face of continuingattempts to discredit her and the other sources.We are better for the fact that there are too many others to mention them all.But here are some: Ally Canosa, Annabella Sciorra, Asia Argento, Brooke Nevils,Daryl Hannah, Emma de Caunes, Jane Wallace, Jennifer Laird, Jessica Barth, KarenMcDougal, Lauren O’Connor, Lucia Evans, Melissa Lonner, Mira Sorvino, RoseMcGowan, Rowena Chiu, Sophie Dix, and Zelda Perkins.Finally, thank you to my family. My mother, who stood by a survivor of abuse inthe face of smearing and blacklisting and intimidation, constantly inspires meto be a better person. My sister Dylan’s courage kept me going and helped meunderstand the unfathomable—and she provided the interior illustrations in Catchand Kill. My sister Quincy, whose wedding I missed while closing the Weinsteinstory, was so understanding. I’m sorry, Quincy!Jonathan already got a dedication and he’s quoted throughout these pages. Howmuch more attention does he need?"},{"pageContent":"Discover Your Next Great ReadGet sneak peeks, book recommendations, and news about your favorite authors.Tap here to learn more[https://discover.hachettebookgroup.com/?ref=9780316486668&discp=100].Little Brown logo [images/publisher-logo.png]"},{"pageContent":"ABOUT THE AUTHOR [toc.xhtml#toc-personblurb]Ronan Farrow is a contributing writer for The New Yorker, where hisinvestigative reporting has won the Pulitzer Prize for public service, theNational Magazine Award, and the George Polk Award, among other honors.
