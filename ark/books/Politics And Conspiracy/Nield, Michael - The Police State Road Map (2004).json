Bush, State of the Union Address, 29 January 1991. There is a chance for the Presiden t of the United States to use this disaster to carry out what his father - a phrase his father used I think only once, and it hasn't been used since - and that is a new world order- Senator Gary Hart, Council on Foreign Relations meeting, 12 September 2001 Noting that the European Union was coming to a turning point in its existence, the European Council which met in Laeke n, Belgium, on 14 and 15 December 2001 convened the European Convention on the Future of Europe. The Convention was asked to draw up proposals on three subjects: how to bring citizens closer to the European design and European Institutions; how to organi se politics and the European political area in an enlarged Union; and how to develop the Union into a stabilising factor and a model in the new world order. Valéry Gisca rd d’Estaing, President of the Convention, Preface to the Draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, July 2003 Once the legal and technological apparatus of totalitaria nism is establish ed, there exists the very real prospect of a permanent planetary dictatorship where human existence is micro-managed from cloud cuckoo land by a tiny ruling elite who are themselves above the law. - chapter 11,the book you are about to read... A 'new world ord er' is a vi sion long shared by political leaders, industr ialists, and intellectua ls around the world. 'Peace and se curity , freed om, and the rule of law', what a wonder ful idea! Strange then, that they have tried to conceal the reality of their vision from the wider public. For over thirty years, the European project was sold to the British people as little more than a ben ign fr ee-trade agreem ent, despite the fact most of our new laws originate in Bruss els and we are being asked to relinquish most of our independe nce under the European Constitut ion. The same process is underway on the American continent: NAFTA and the Free Trade Area of the Americas are the basis f or supra- nationa l political bureaucra cies base d on the European model.

This is the geo-political skeleton of the New World Order , which its advocate s realize most people would reject. Now that many o f the levers and motors have been asse mbled onto the frame, the nature and funct ion of the Death Star is plain to see. This i s not the birth global liberal democ racy and un iversal human r ights; it is the end of them. 'Global fascism ' or 'global feudalism' are terms often used by its detracto rs. Parliamentary d emocracy, human r ights, economic freed om, and scie ntific integrity are rapidly being replaced with a p rivately con trolled d ictatorship o f bureaucra cy and t echnocracy that sur passes Orwe ll's nightmar ish vision. This is the point at wh ich we enter the world of 'conspir acy', for which the internet is renowned . This a place where mainstream opinion fears to tread, fearing close encounters with flying sauce rs or alien abduct ion. Th is e-book sketc hes the panorama of the grand sch eme unfo lding, examining major trends in politics, international relations, scienc e, and med icine. It contai ns hundreds of references - most of which can be checked at the click of a mous e - which w ill help readers to decide whether this is conspiracy theory or conspiracy fact. Much of the evidence pres ented here appe ars in the mainstream pres s but is rarely supplemented with cont extual anal ysis which would reveal the grand design. All too often, journalists find that Bi g Broth er has his hand o n the ir pen. This has create d a niche for an 'a lternative medi a', largely based on the internet. Form er British Env ironment Minister, Michael Mea cher MP, said that the internet hosts the 'new reality', the forum in which unconv entional questions can be asked. So what does the future have in store? The first part of this book, 'Three Hundred Trillion Doll ars and Co unting', descr ibes how the driving force behind political globalization is financial globalization. The world's super -rich el ite who own and d irect the world's bank s and conglomerate s are creating the first financial global empire through corporate mergers and in ternational economic piracy. T hese kingmakers have financial interests in countries all over the world and work togethe r to creat e the internationa l political struct ures nece ssary for world dom ination. And becau se the med ia focu ses on the stage of the puppet show, few suppo se there might be a hidden aristocrac y pulling the strin gs. The second part, 'The Art of Killing Quietly', identifies what this car tel of financial barons, med ia mogu ls and key political minions are doing, or want to do to us. It concludes that th is de facto elite regard most people on the planet as 'useles s eaters' worthy of execution at the ir wh im. Of cour se, the 'catt le' carryi ng out their plan do so unwittingly. Mass manipulation is the supr eme application of money power since human ity would not knowingly build a prison for itself and hand the key over to a tiny ruling elite. Some have even been persuaded that in order to 'save the planet' we must kill off most of the people. Jacq ues Cousteau said in the UNESCO Courier of November 1991 that, One American burdens the Earth much more than twenty Bang ladeshis.. .. In order to stabilize world populat ion, we must eliminate 350,000 people per day This resembles George Bernard Shaw's summat ion in his Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism, that under socialism you need permission to live, and if you didn't live well you'd be execu ted (in a k indly manner). And so today, i n most policy areas we proc eed on the basis of a manufactu red prem ise handed down from on-high so that the end appears to justify the means.

This is the natural patronage of the credulous by the crooked. The modus operandi of the New Worl d Order is the 'psycholo gical operation', dressing up po licies as some thing e lse, getting the populace to dig their own mass grav e.

Maintaining this international army i s a very expen sive business, so it is important t o understand the sourc e of its funds. 1.1 THE MONEY MAGICIANS I am afraid that the ordinary citizen will not like to be told that the banks can and d o create money... And they who control the credit of the nation direct the policy of Governments and hold in the hollow of their hands the destiny of the people - Reginald McKenna speaking to stockholder s as Chairman of the Board of Midland Bank in Januar y 1924 . (1) G. Edwar d Griffin's book The Creature from Jekyll Island is the sourc e for the following exp lanation (2) - a benchmark publication on the subject of bank ing and the New World Order. Western bank s create money through a fract ional-reserve lending sy stem. Central banks lend money to gove rnments to make up for the deficit in taxat ion receipts. The banks print money out of noth ing and receive interes t bearing governmen t bonds in return. These bonds are called \"secur ities\" because they are backed by the full credit and i ntegrity of taxpayers who pay back the loans through taxat ion. Eventually every pound or dollar borrowed pass es through the current accounts and sav ings accounts oper ated by comm ercial banks. Under the rules of fractional-reser ve bank ing, for the purpose of lending m oney, the comme rcial banker is allowed to print nine m ore pounds or dollars than he holds on deposit, or what ever ratio the central bank decides. He pays saver s a modes t rate of interest and charge s borrowers a much higher rate on up to ten times the amount. H is only costs are his buildings, emp loyees, and book- keeping . The only risk he takes is an acc ounting risk if too many lo ans go into defau lt at onc e. Howev er, if he gets into serious trouble the central bank w ill come running to his aid with more money printed out of noth ing. Looking for the equity in this system is fruitless. Every penny and cent in circulation requires interest payment to the money power s because money is debt. Hundreds of billions of dollars world-wide are paid in interes t every year to men who print money out of noth ing. A frequently asked questio n is, 'wher e does the money come from to pay the interest on the loan?' Quite simply there is none. Inter est payments are serviced 10 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"by payment in kind - through labour. This is a game of musica l chairs where the money keeps on circulating between creditors and de btors. The profits from the banks are used by their share holders to buy good s and service s, passin g the money to the workers to pay back the capital and t he interest . If the game of musical chairs ever stopped there wouldn't be enough money in circulation to repay a penny or cent of interest. But the game is designed to go on forever. Having sa id all this, the bankers are permanently and nece ssarily interpos ed between parties in the market place, a llowing us to trade goods and ser vices for money. But they charg e a high price for their services, as many Th ird World natio ns have found out, and have becom e fantastically wealthy as a result. The problem of this money monop oly is as much a political one as an ec onomic one. On the eve of the 2001 General E lection , Prime Minister Tony Blair was interviewed by the BBC' s leading news presenter , Jeremy Paxman. There was an extraordinary exchange over the question of whet her or not someone can become too rich. (3) In describing th e extent to which money really is power, the rest of this book explains one of the reas ons why Tony Blair did not want to answer that q uestion. PAXMAN: Do you believe t hat an individual can earn too much money? BLAIR: I don't really - it is not - no, it's not a view I have. Do you mean that we should cap someone's incom e? Not really, no. Why? What is the point? You can spend ages trying to stop the highest paid earners earning the money but in an internationa l market like today, you probably would drive them abroad. What does that matter? Surely the impor tant thing is to level up those people that don't have opportunity in our society. PAXMAN: But where is the justice in taxing someone who earns £34,000 a year, which is about enough to cover a mortgage on a one-bedroom flat in outer London, at the same rate as someone who earns £34 million. Where is the justice? BLAIR: The person who earns £34 million, if they're paying the top rate of tax, will pay far more tax on the £34 million than the person on £34,000. PAXMAN: I am asking you about the rate of tax. BLAIR: I know and what I am saying to you is the rate is less importan t in this instanc e than the overall amount of tax that people would pay. You know what would happen, if you go back to the days of high top rates of tax. All that would happen is that those people, who are small in number actually, and you can spend a lot of time getting after the person earning millions of pound a year, and then what you don't do is apply the real energy where it's necessary on things like the children's tax credit, the Working Families Tax Credit, the minimum wage, the New Deal, all the things that have helped people on lower incom es. PAXMAN: But where is the justice in it? BLAIR: When you say where is the justice in that, the justice for me is concentrated on lifting incom es of those that don't have a decent income .

But the lowest income families in this country are benefiting from the government. Their incomes are rising. The fact that you have some people at the top end earning more PAXMAN: ..Benefiting more! BLAIR: If they are earning more, fine, they pay their taxes. PAXMAN: But is it acceptable for gap b etween rich and p oor to widen? BLAIR: It is acceptable for those people on lower incom es to have their incomes raised. It is unacceptable that they are not given the chances. To me, the key thing is not whether the gap between those who, between the person who earns the most in the country and the person that earns the least, whether that gap is. PAXMAN: So it is acceptable for gap to widen between rich and poor? BLAIR: It is not acceptable for poor people not to be given the chances they need in life. PAXMAN: That is not my question. BLAIR: I know it's not your question but it's the way I choose to answer it. If you end up going after those people who are the most wealthy in society, what you actually end up doing is in fact not even helping those at the bottom end.

What I am saying is that my task is PAXMAN: You are not saying no. BLAIR: But I don't think that is the issue PAXMAN: You may not think it is the issue, but it is the question. I s it OK for the gap to get wider ? BLAIR: It may be the question. T he way I choose to answer it is to say the job of government is make sure that those at the bottom get the chances.

BLAIR: Yes, I know what your question is. I am choosing to answer it in my way rather than yours. PAXMAN: But you're not answering it. BLAIR: I am. PAXMAN: You are answering another question.

Because if you end up saying no, actually my task is to stop the person earning a lot of money earning a lot of money, you waste all your time and energy, taking money off the people who are very wealthy when in today's world, they probably would move elsewhere and make their money. What you are not asking me about, which would be a more fruitful line of endeavour, is what are you doing for the poorest people to give them a boost. PAXMAN: Let's talk about tax.

The wealth of the Roths child dynasty in the ninetee nth century was legendary. In building the mightiest private bank the world has ever seen, the Rothschilds amass ed the largest private fortune in the history of capitalism. Since 1919 , the world gold price has been fixed da ily at the office of N.M. Roth schild & Sons in London. Howeve r, before World W ar I the European and American money power s 13 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"had a lready form ed a lasting par tnership. Potentia l compet itors on Wall Street, which included European bank ing hou ses, decided that they could reduce compe tition from the provincial banks and achieve higher profits if only they had a f unctiona l central bank l ike those in Europe and co operated in printing America's money . (4) A central b ank is a pr ivate cartel enforc ed by the police power of govern ment. Created in 1913, the Federal Re serve 'System' was designed to benefit the most powerful New York banks, halting the loss of business to the hundre ds of smaller banks in the south ern and weste rn states. The system appeared to distribute power equally betwee n the twelve regional branches but i n reality, it gave power to the New York branch controlled by T he Money Trust on Wall Street. (5) The Jekyll Island P lan for the Federal Reserve Act was drawn up by the five bi ggest banki ng houses in Europe and Ame rica: Roth schild, Rockefeller, Mor gan, Warburg and Kuhn Loeb. (6) It's chief architect was Paul Warbur g of the German and Sw iss bank ing hou se who mov ed to America only nine years earlier. He brought with him all the experie nce of Europe an central bank ing. His brother Max Warburg was financial adviser to the Kaiser and l ater Director of Germany's central bank , The Reichsbank. (7) Paul Warbur g's Wall Street banking operation was a partnership w ith the Roths childs in Kuhn Loeb & Co.. After working togethe r to create the 'Fed', the members of the cartel devised the acceptanc e market which powere d up their n ewly created money printing press. Through the 1920s the acceptanc e market created over half of all the money printed by the Fed. (8) Since then, the agents of the private comm ercial banks, who sit on the boards of the central ban ks throughout the world, have work ed togeth er to formu late international monetary policy. In 1966 , Bill Clinton's mentor at George town University, Profe ssor Carro ll Quigley, described the system in his book Tragedy and H ope : (9) The substantive financ ial powers of the world were in the hands of these investment bankers... who remained largely behind the scenes in their own unincorporated private ban ks. These formed a system of internat ional co- operation and na tional dominan ce which was more private, more powerful and more secret than that of their agents in the central banks... In addition to these pragm atic goals, the powers of financial capital ism had anoth er far reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financ ial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and t he economy of the world as a whole. T his system was to be controlled in a feudalistic fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at infrequent private meetings and c onferences. The apex of this system was to be the Bank for Internatio nal Settlements in Basle, Switzerland, a private b ank owned and controlled by the world's central banks which were themselves private corporations... The internat ional nature of the cartel was evidence d during the 1920s when the Govern or of the New York Fede ral Res erve Bank, Benja min St rong, worked with Montague Norm an, the Governor of the Bank of England, to assist the economy of Great Britain at the expense of Ame rican investors. Incre asing the U.S. money supp ly contributed to a massiv e speculat ive boom in the stock market and the Wall Street Crash in 1929 .

Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and m anufacturing are afraid of somebody, afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocking, so complete, so pervasive that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnat ion of it. (11) In July 2003 i t was ment ioned in the news that the Rothschild internat ional investment bank ing group is controlled by a pare nt company called Roths child Continuation Holdings A.G., located in Switzerland. Far from being compe ting factions, the English and Fr ench Roth schilds have worked out a dea l merg ing control of their resp ective banking ho uses by forming a new holding com pany, Concordia B.V. . (12) I t is these family run private banks which continue to coordinate central bank policy. On 28 J une 1998, The Washingt on Post published an article about the Bank for Internation al Settlements descr ibing how \"this economic cabal.... this secretive group... the financial powers who control the world's supply of money\" shape the world's economy. (13) The next chapt er asks the question, ' who today really has all the money and where is it invested?'. This i s not possible to answer with satisfactory precision but there are some good indicators that pr ovide much food for thought. Chapter 1 End Not es 1.

The epoch of trusts had ended in The Great Trust. (1) 2.1 THE MILI TARY-INDUS TRIAL COMPLEX The bankers have invested their vast fortune s in every branch of comm erce, cementing monop olies with interlock ing sh areholdings and d irecto rships. In John D. Ro ckefeller's immortal phrase \"comp etition is a sin .\" The establishment of the European-American petrochemical cartel was achieved in 1929 with the marriage of I.G. Farben of Germany to I.C.I. and Shel l Oil of Great Britain, and t o Standard Oil and Du Pont of America. (2) The cartel was formed after I.G. Farben discovered how to make petroleum out of coal. I.G. agreed not to enter the petroleum market so long as Standard Oil did not enter the chemica l industry unless as a partner with Farben. By the beginn ing of WWI I, Farben had bec ome the largest industr ial enterprise in Europe, the largest chemical company in the world , and pa rt of the most power ful cartel in history. Beside s the afore -mentioned comp anies, it had cartel ag reeme nts with 200 0 companies around the world including Ford Motor Co, A lcoa, General Motors, Texaco, Proct or and Gamb le, and v irtually every enterprise that involved chemicals. Hermann Schmitz , president of Bayer A.G and I .G. Farben during WWI I, who also largely directed the Deut sche Bank, he ld a substan tial amount of stock in Standard Oil of New Jersey. (3) G. Edward Griffin's investigation into the canc er industry found that the cartel agreeme nt signed betwee n Standard Oil and Farben on 9 November 1929 involved the exchange of some of Farben's patent rights over the coal- hydrogenation process for $30,000,000 of Standard's stock . The Rockefeller group concealed its Far ben holdings in false fronts and dum my accounts and when Farben' s vast holdings were finally sold i n 1962 , the Rockefellers were the dom inant force in carrying out the transact ion. (4) Paul Warburg, another founding member of the Wall St. bank ing cartel , was also a director of sever al Far ben subsidi aries. (5) A cartel is a groupin g of companies that a re bound together by contract s or agreem ents designed to promot e inter-company cooperation and thereby reduce comp etition betwe en them. Some of thes e agreeme nts may deal with harm less subjects such as industry standar ds and no menclature. But most of them involve the exchange of patent rights, the dividing of regional mar kets, the setting of prices, and agreemen ts not to enter into product comp etition within specif ic 16 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"categ ories. (6) In 1937, Fortune magazine editorialized: By and large, the chemical industry has regulated itself in a mann er that would please even a Soviet Commissar... The indus try...is... the practitioner o f one definite sort of planned economy. In 1973 , the United State s Tariff C ommission obs erved: In the larges t and most sophisticated multinational corporation s, planning and s ubsequent monito ring of plan fulfillment have reached a scope and level of detail that, ironically, resemble more than superficially the natio nal planning procedures of Communist countries. Far from the money power s fighting for free-markets and aga inst governm ent regulation, the exact oppo site is true. G iant cartels use government regu lation and ant i-trust laws to break up sma ller cartels or to prevent competitors entering into the market. The ultimate obje ctive is a feuda l 'comand and con trol' society in which the corp orations use governme nt to diminish ou r freed oms. 2.2 FIVE MONOPOLIES Corpor orate monopolies over water , food, ener gy, med icine, and i nformat ion, are just some man ifestations of The Great Trust today. The explosive growth of three private water utility companies in the last 10 years raises fears that mank ind may b e losing co ntrol of its most vital resource to a handfu l of monopolistic corporations. In Europe and North America, ana lysts predict that w ithin the next 15 y ears these companies will cont rol 65 perc ent to 75 perc ent of what are now public wat erworks. The companies have worked closely with the World Bank and other internatio nal financial institutions to gain a footh old on every continent. A year long investiga tion by t he International Consortium of Inve stigat ive Journalists (ICIJ), a proje ct of the Center for Public Integrity , (7) found that wor ld's three largest water companies - France 's Suez and Vivendi Environneme nt, and Brit ish-based Tham es Water owned by Germany' s RWE AG - have expanded into every region of the world sin ce 1990 . Three other companies, Saur of France, and Un ited Utilities of England wor king i n conju nction with Bechtel of the United State s, have also successfully sec ured major internationa l drinking water contracts. But their size pales in comparison to that of the big three. The water companies are chasin g a bus iness with pot ential annual revenue estimated at anywher e from $400 b illion to $3 trillion. (8) In 2002 , the American retailer Wa l-Mart was the biggest company in the world, with turnover of $219 bi llion ahead of Exxon at $191 bi llion and Gener al Motors at $177 bi llion. Five retailers- Wal-Mart, Safe way, Kroger, Albertson 's and Ahold- take 33% of American groc ery sales. (9) In the U.K. there is even more consolidation: 60-75% of groceries are purchased in the top 5 supermark ets. (10) The oil industry is dom inated by five companies : ( In order of size) ExxonM obil, Royal Dut ch-Shell, British Pe troleum-Amoco, Chevron- Texac o, and TotalF inaElf. Inter estingly the recent Exxon -Mobil merger reunited the two biggest chunks of John D. Ro ckefeller' s Standard Oil monopoly dismant led by the U.S. governm ent 90 y ears ago. Mobil was Standard Oil of New York and Exxon was Standar d Oil of New Jersey.

Recently le gal rulings in Europe clear ly indicate that there is mor e trans- Atlantic con solidation to come. The London Financial Times reported on 21 July 03: The passage into law of the Communications Bill closes a turbulent chapter in the history of UK media...allowed the lifting of the bar on investments in ITV or Channel Five by non-European inter ests, the larges t of which are US m edia conglomerat es... the bill is, by internat ional standar ds, extremely liberal on ownership but highly structured for content regulation, to be applied by Ofcom, the new media regulator. (14) This followed a European Court of Justice ruling in favour of merger s and acquisitions. On 4 J une 2002, the BBC reporte d that t he European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that re strictions by som e European governm ents on foreign owners hip of privatized companies are illegal. The decis ion makes it more difficult for government s to block foreign in vestment in former state-owned firms on natio nal interes t grounds, paving the way for more cross-border take overs and merger s. The decision has also boos ted a planned overhaul o f E.U. takeover law aimed at mak ing it easier for firms to launch cross-border mergers and acquisitions. The reform is an im portant element of E.U. plans to create a single European market for investme nt services by 2005. (15) 2.3 WHO OWNS THE STOCK? A recent article in the London Financial Times indicates why i t is impossible to gain an accurate estimate of the wealth of the trillionaire bank ing elite. Discussing the sale of Evelyn Rothschild's stake in Roth schild Contin uation Holdings, i t states : ..[this] requires agreement on the valuation of privately held assets whose value has never been tested in a public market. Most of these assets are held in a complex network of tax-efficient structures around the world. (16) Queen Elizabeth II's shareholdings remain hidden behind Bank of England Nominee accounts.

This is because her subjects have no way of knowing through a public register of interests where she, as their head of state, chooses to invest her money. Unlike the members of the Commons and n ow the Lords, the Queen does not have to annu ally declare her inter ests and a s a result her subjects cannot question her or know about potential conflicts of inter ests... In fact, the Queen even has an extra mechanism to ensure that h er investmen ts remain secret - a nominee compan y called the Bank of Englan d Nominees . It has been available for decades to all the world's current heads of state to allow them anonymity when buying shares. Therefore, when a compan y publ ishes a share register and the Bank of England Nominee s is listed, it is not possible to gauge whether the Queen, President Bush or even Saddam H ussein is the true shareholder. (17) By this method, the trillionaire maste rs of the universe rema in hidden whilst Forbes magaz ine pose s lower ranking bi llionaires like Bill Gate s and Warren Buffett as the richest men in the world. Retired manage ment cons ultan t Gaylon Ross Sr, author of Who's Who of the Global Elite , has been tipped from a private source that the combined wealth of the Rockefeller family in 1998 was approx imately (U.S.) $11 t rillion and the Rothschilds (U.S .) $100 tri llion. (18) Howev er something o f an i nsider's know ledge of the hidden wealth of the elite is contained in the article, Will the Dollar and America Fall Down on August 19?. .\" on page1 of the 12th July 2001 issue of Russian n ewspaper, Pravda (19) . The newspap er interviewed Tatyan a Koryagina, a senior research fellow in the Institute of Macr oeconomic Researches subordinated to the Russian Ministry of Econo mic Developm ent (Minekon om), on the subje ct of a rece nt conference concerning th e fate of the U.S. ec onomy: Koryagina: The known history of civilization is merely the visible part of the icebe rg. There is a shadow economy, shadow politics and also a shadow history, known to conspirolog ists. There are [unseen] forces acting in the world, unstoppable for [most powerful] countries and even continents . Pravda: Just these forces intend to smash America on Augus t 19? Koryagina: There are international \"super-state\" and \"super-government\" groups. In accordance with tradition, the mystical and religious components play extremely important roles in human history. One must take into account the shadow economy, shadow politics and the religious component, while predicting the development of the present financ ial situat ion. Pravda: Still, I don't understand what could be done to this giant country [the U.S.], whose budg et is calculated in the trillions of dollars. Koryagina: It is possible to do anything to the U.S... whose total debt has reached $26 trillion. Generally, the Western economy is at the boiling point now. Shad ow financial activities of $300 trillion are hang ing over the planet. At any moment, they could fall on any stock exchange and cause panic and crash. The recent crisis in Southeast Asia, which touched Russia, was a rehearsal.

Editing cer tain news out of the press has been just as important as putti ng propaganda in, probab ly more so. Westerners receive relatively little news about the atrocit ies committed in the social ist dictatorships especially in the former Soviet Union and comm unist China wh ich con tinue to this day. The last th ing they want the public to hear on the evening news is the fact that i ts our money which has kept these regimes afloat, or to find out who helped them into power. In 1917 Congre ssman Oscar Callaway told the House that, in 1915 JP Morgan interests and their subsidi ary organizat ions purchas ed the editorial policies of the 25 most important newspape rs in the U.S. By contr olling the policy of the most important, they were able to control the general policy of the whole media. They used this power to turn public opinion in favour of entering the First World War. (21) The Rockefellers took over the Morgan empire, and i n the 1950s they had one of their pharmaceut ical com pany directors and pub lisher of the New York Times , Arthur Hays Sulzberger, app ointed as Director of the Associated Press . They also owned the trend setting magaz ines Time, Life, Fortune, and Newsweek . (22) Laurance Rockefeller was a director of The Reader's Digest, a baromet er of orthodox thinking, especially on the medical issues in which his family had enorm ous financial interests. (23) Forbes Magazine's recent bio' of med ia tyco on, Conrad Black read: 67% ownership in Ravelston Corp., a privately held company, gives him control of a 78% stake in Hollinge r Inc., a publicly traded Canadian holding company with real estate and other investments. Hollinger, in turn, owns 32%of the equity and 73% of he votin g control of Hollinger International, the Big Board media company that owns the news papers. There is also a hefty dose of debt finan cing in this chain . Thus does Black, with a mere $13 million of his own equity money in the till, control $2 billion in media assets. The assets are impressive: Black's 129 news papers include the Chicago Sun- Times, the fifth-largest paper in the U.S.; the Jerus alem Post, with a circulation of 11 0,000; and the London Daily Telegraph, which has 40% of the market for natio nal broadsheet newspapers in the U.K...Directors include such illuminati as Henry Kissinger; former Illinois Governo r James R.

As well as being the largest shareh older in De Beers, Roth schild was also amongst the 'circle of initiates' in the Milner group.This c lique of British aristocrats invented the Round Table movem ent aimed at fostering internationa l governmen t.

The plans for these two groups were drawn up at the 1919 Par is Peac e Conference. The RIIA was largely funded by the Astor family, The Rhode s Trust and cer tain Bri tish banks whilst the CFR was a front for JP Morgan &Co.

Gordon Tether was finally fired after several attempts to pub lish arti cles about Bilderberg in the Lombard Column (10) TRUST ME, I'M A BILDER BERGER Unlike Mr Teth er, Financial Times column ist Mar tin Wolf has been a regular attende e of Bilderberg for years. Only this year di d he publish the fact in the FT , writing an art icle on the conference in Versailles in May 2003. Since the meetings are strictly confident ial, we can only assume that Mr Wolf 's sugg estion of a rift in American and European foreign po licy is the first ever official - and well timed - piece of Bilderberg propaganda.

Its member s are one hundred individuals, at p resent drawn from 52 coun tries and five continents. (12) It was founded in 1968 by Dr Aurelio Peccei on behalf of Fiat and Ol ivetti.

In the United States that wave has been directed at chang ing the bias of American education away from individualism towards socia lism and in ternationalism. The Ford Foundatio n was established in 1936 by Henry Ford of Ford Motor Company. In January 2002 it s asse ts were valued at $13 b illion and to tal grants since 1972 al one total $10.2 billion! (14) The major Rockefeller fam ily foun dations were establ ished by John D. R ockefeller - the Gener al Education Boar d in 1903 endowed with $129 mi llion, and The Rockefeller Foundat ion in 1913 endow ed with $50 m illion. Total grants to date by the Rock efeller Foundation are estimated at $ 2 b illion. (15) The Rockefeller Broth ers Fund was founded in 1940 and by January 2003 i t had g iven away $ 574,466,677. RBF merged with The Charles E. Culpepper Foundation in July 1999. (16) The Carneg ie Endowm ent Fund was establ ished in 1910 with a $10 million endowme nt from Andre w Carneg ie (17) and became a key partner of the Rockefeller and Ford foundations in pursu it of a single aim. That aim becam e apparent to The Congressional Specia l Comm ittee to Investigate Tax-exemp t Foundations, known as the 'Reece Comm ittee', set up in 1952 . To their conc ern, the Committee discov ered that the Rock efeller and Carneg ie group of foundat ions exercised a very significant de gree of control ove r American schools and universities. In 1954 N orman Dodd was the staff director of the comm ittee. He recorded an interview with G. Edwar d Griffin shortly befor e he died in which he described how the Carnegie Endowm ent and the Rockefeller Foundation joined forces after the end of World War I to use the educat ion syste m, and the teachin g of American history in particular, to promot e internationa lism and col lectiv ism. And when Rowan Gaither, President of the Ford Foundation, met with Mr Dodd he made an astonish ing adm ission: Mr. Dodd, all of us who have a hand in the making of policies here have had experience operating under directives, the substance of which is that we shall use our grant- making power so to alter li fe in the United States that it can be comfortably merged with the Soviet Union. (18) 3.3 THE IMF AND WORLD BANK The establishment of the United Nations in 1945, only a year after the IMF and World Bank, is some evidenc e of the parity of political and f inancial globalization. Vladimir Bukov sky, possibly the most famous Soviet dissident after Alexander Solzhenit syn, spent twelve years in Soviet prisons and psy chiatric hospit als due to his oppo sition to commun ism. He gave his opin ion on the U.N. in a recent interview: It was meant to serve the \"progressive c auses\", such as advancement of 26 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"socialism, \"national liberation\", unilateral disarmament of the West, redistribution of wealth from the \"rich North\" to the \"poor South\" or just plain anti-Western propaganda. (19) Whilst the U.N. has pursued that goal through internat ional aid and i nter- governmen tal agencies, its sister financial organizations have been the key drivers for international socialism and the first world financial emp ire. In Septe mber 1963, President Kenn edy addre ssed the annual conference of the IMF/World Bank and descr ibed the intent be hind the creation of thes e institutions: Twenty years ago, when the architects of these institutions met to design an intern ationa l banking structure, the economic life of the world was polarized in overwhelming, and even alarm ing measure on the United States... Sixty percent of the gold reserves of the world were here... There was a need for redistribution of the finan cial resources of the world.. And there was an equal need to organize a flow of capital to the impoverished countries of the world. All this has come about. It did not come about by chance but by conscious and deliberate and responsible planning . (20) Under the Bretton Woods agreements, The World Bank was to make loans to under- develope d countries and the IMF was to promote monetary cooperation between nations by maintaining fixed exchang e rates between their curr encies. Under the IMF quota system, the majority of the donated capital to the IMF come s from Western gove rnmen ts, especially the U.S.. In 1970, the IMF came up with the \"SDR \" schem e for increasing quota capital. Special Drawing Rights, which are merely governm ent promises to pay, increase the quot a by 25%. (21) The IMF now has reserves against which its sister organ ization the World Bank can obta in loans from weste rn comm ercial bank s for develop ing countries. Thes e loans can be obta ined at a very low rate of interest becau se western governmen ts offer to bail out the World Bank with \"callable cap ital\" if it gets into troub le. The callable cap ital is about ten times as much as the quota capital. Over the last fifty years a torrent of Dollars, Po unds, Franc s, Deut sche Mark s and Ye n gushed through the World Bank /IMF directly into the hands of foreign d ictators and used to build the one system dictators knew how to build: Social ism and despo tism. (22) The following chapters show that wha t appeared here to be simple foreign investment,was actua lly laying down the gangp lank for the capta ins of Western industry and f inance to board the ship, loot it, and sail off into the sunse t with most of the Third World's natura l resources and i ndustries. Financ ial globalization has been achie ved through economic piracy masquer ading as international credit. 3.4 CONTROL OVER WESTERN GOVERNMENT Before the bankers could channel billions of dollars to foreign dictators and set up inter-governm ental st ructure s, they need ed Western politicians who were amenab le to their plan. By controlling policy-making groups, education and the media, the bankers have helped to make internationa l socialism more politically accep table than i t otherwise would be. Ther e have also been very significant instances where the financial elite hav e selected and sponsored witting servants for the top jobs in politics to further their globalist aims.

(25) On 19 Septe mber 2000 , an article appe ared in The Daily Tel egraph by Ambro se Evans-Pritchard which pu llled all this together in just a few par agraphs (26) . It began: DECLASSIFIED American government documents show that the US intelligence community ran a campa ign in the Fifties and Sixties to build momentum for a united Europe. It funded and directed the European federalist movement. The documents confirm suspicions voiced at the time that America was working aggressively behind the scenes to push Britain into a European state. One memorandum , dated July 26, 1950, gives instructions for a campaign to promote a fully fledged European parliament . It is signed by Gen William J Donovan, head of the American wartime Office of Strategic Services, precursor of the CIA. The article went on to decribe how the Rockefeller and Ford Foun dations set up an organ ization called the American Committee for a Uni ted Europe in 1948 which was run by CIA chiefs on their beha lf. The docume nts show that AC UE financed the European Movement, the most important fede ralist organisation i n the post-war y ears. In 1958 , for examp le, it provided 53.5 pe r cent of the movemen t's funds. Furthermo re,the European Youth Campaign, an arm of the European Movem ent, was whol ly funded and control led by Washington. The Belgian director, Baron Boel, received monthly payments into a spe cial acco unt. The leaders of the European Movement - Retinger, the visionary R obert Schuman and the former Belgi an prime minister Paul-Henri Spaak - were all treated as hired ha nds by the ir Ame rican spon sors. Also, A memo from the European section, dated June 11, 1965 , advises the vice-p resident of the European Economic Community, Robert Marjolin, to pursue monetary union by stealth. 28 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"It recommends suppressing debate until the point at which \"adoption of such proposals would become virtually inescapable\". What the Telegraph article didn't ment ion was that a ll of the OSS-CIA-ACUE principals involved in the \"European federal ist m oveme nt\" - Donovan, Smit h, and Dulles - were also Council on Fore ign R elations members (27) More evidence of this nature was recently obtai ned from the secret arch ives of the Soviet Union. Prime Min ister Yeltsin outlawe d the Com munist par ty in 1991 but when he was challenged in the courts, he needed evidenc e of its criminal past. He turned to Vladimir Buk ovsky for assistance in finding the evidence in the secret arch ives of the Politburo. In 1992 , Mr Bukov sky was granted acce ss to the archives for half a year, and copied as many docu ments as he could us ing a portab le scanne r and comp uter. Even the very small proportion of docum ents copied revealed much that was embarras sing to both Western and Soviet leaders. Cons equently, these arch ives - including the docum ents which Mr Bukovs ky still has on his comp uter- have been classifie d agai n! His 44 page booklet entitled E.U.S.S.R., publ ished in December 2004 , reveal some truly astonish ing fact s about the collapse of the Soviet Union. (28) By 1987 , Gorbach ev had d ecided that pere stroika i ncluded the conv ergence of the U.S.S.R. and Europe into a \"Commo n European Home\". This idea was supported by Europe' s social democr ats whos e political leaders went in secret to Moscow befor e the dissolu tion of the U.S.S.R . to confirm that the European Commun ity would include most of the Soviet states. Howev er, behind these political leader s were the financial elite, in particular the member s of the Trilateral Comm ission. One of the Politburo docum ents reco rds a meeti ng which took place on 18th January 1989 between Gorbachev and key member s of the Trilateral Comm ission - Rockefeller, Kissinger , Nakas one and Gi scard d'Estaing . They encouraged the Soviets to integrate into the world's economic and fi nancial institutions (GATT, IMF) and al so into the European Comm unity. Giscard announced that ther e would be a European state within twenty years and ask ed Gorbach ev which East Europe an countries would be allowed to join. Kissinger then asked what the Sovie ts thought of the concept of 'Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals'. On 19 Ju ly 1990, Jacq ues Delors, Preside nt of The European Comm ission visited Moscow and con firmed in secret that he wanted the Soviet Union to be part of the future European state. Howev er three months before, his close friend and European co-chairman of the Trilateral Commission, Georg es Berthoin had met with Gorbachev 's European advisor, Vad im Zag ladin. Berthoin was the ambassad or who set out Delor s' views ahead of time. One of the possibl ities Delors asked him to discuss was whether the USA and Japan should also be integrated with Europe and the Soviet Union. This idea reflected the inter- continenta l membership of the Trilateral Commission. As we near our final destination of one world gove rnment and the New World Order, i t's very important to realize who planned the journ ey. Why have the richest and most powerful m en in the world done everything pos sible to conc eal what they have been doing? I f we are on the road to utop ia, why the need for secrecy?

It has been laid down using a two pronged strategy. The first was to finance corrupt and social ist regimes in develop ing countries in order to stifle the growth of domestic free enterprise causing them to becom e depende nt on Western industry and fi nance. The second was a form of international economic piracy, where the World Bank and IM F fired a broadside of debt at T hird Wo rld econom ies, knocking out their eng ine of growth, and a llowing the Western multinationals to climb aboar d and p lunder their nat ional resources and natura l industries. The success of the strategy can be judged on the one hand by l ooking at progres s towards free- market economies and property rights around the world, and the other, the extent to which develop ing coun tries are beholden to Western corpo rations. To reach a mora l conclusion about it, one might also consider the impact of the strategy on human rights, be cause the cartel has financed communist and fascist regimes alike, with absolu tely no qualms about the human cost. The emblem which best represents it is the skull and cros s-bones motif of Yales' famous secret society, The Order of Skull and Bon es. Many member s of the cartel have belonged to it including generations of the Bush family. This emblem is the universal symbol of both and p iracy and lethality, thereby repres enting th e economic poison swallowed by most Third World nat ions. The Order was founded in 1832 by W illiam Russ ell whose family fortun e was built upon the global trade in opium, a substan ce almost as addictive and destruc tive as the drip-feed of Western currency. 4.1 THE HEART OF THE ISSUE: POWER AND PROPERTY RIGHTS There is a st aggering cor relation between private property rights and po litical freed oms. GNP per capita in the U.S. is above $20,000 but in former Easte rn Bloc countries it average s between $730 and $5000 . (1) Whilst governments of lesser developed countries have had acce ss to an un limited supp ly of money from abroad, pr ivate enterprise has been stifled be cause the citizens of thes e countries have been denied acc ess to capital by po liticians. H ernando de Soto 's highly accla imed book The Mystery of Capital (2) documents how much 'dead capital' exists in developing countries. This refers to private property which cannot be used as collateral to obta in loans or buy stock in another business becaus e the owner has not been given adequate property rights by the state. De Soto conclude s: They have houses but not titles; crops but not deeds; businesses but not statutes of incorp oration. It is the unavailability of these essential representations that explains why peopl e who have adapted every other Western invention, from the paper clip to the nuclear reactor, have not been able to produce sufficient capital to make their dome stic capitalism work.

The total value of this dead capital has been calculated to be 9.3 trillion dollars which is forty-six times as much as all the World Bank loans of the past three decade s. 4.2 LESS ONS FROM HIST ORY NAZI GERMANY The Nazis were financed by G erman industries such as Krupp and I.G. Farben and the ir own ers and d irecto rs held key positions in Hitler's governm ent. Howev er, German industry was itself part ly financed by British and Am erican bankers. Much of the capital for the expansion of I.G. Farben came from Wall Stree t, primarily Rockefeller's Natio nal City Bank; Dillon Read & Com pany, also a Rockefeller firm; Morgan 's Equitable Trust Company; Harr is Forb es & Company; and even the predominantly Jewish firm of Kuhn Loeb & Company. In 1928 , Henry Ford merged his German ass ets with those of I.G. Farben. (4) 40% of Ford Motor A.G. of Germany was transferr ed to I.G. Farben and Edsel Fo rd joined the board of Ame rican I.G.. A decade later, in August 1938, Henry Ford received the Grand Cros s of the German Eagle, a Nazi decoration for distinguished foreigner s. (5) During the Allied bomb ing ra ids over Germany, t he factories and o ffices of I.G. Farben were spar ed on instruct ions from the U.S. War Departme nt. RUSSIA Without the intervention of the German government, Round Table leaders and associated Wall Stree t financiers, the Bolshevik re volution wou ld never have succeeded. The popu lar Ker ensky revolut ion wh ich ove r-threw the Tsar occurred in February 1917 . It was relatively moderate in its policies and attempted to accommo date all revolut ionary factio ns including the Bolsh eviks who were the smallest minority. The second revolut ion in October 1917 was a cou p d'etat by the Bolsheviks who had su cceeded in recruiting suffic ient military suppor t with the financial back ing of Round Table and C o. (6) Prom inent American financiers included J.P. Morgan contr olled Guaranty Trust Company and W illiam Boyc e Thompson, a director of the Federal Res erve Bank of New York and le ader of the Red Cross mission to Russia dur ing the revolut ion. (7) British funding came from ban ker and found ing m ember of Round Table, Lord Milner. (8) When private property was outlawed after the revolution, foreign m oney and corpo rations were need ed to prevent the economy and the comm unist regime from collapsing. It has remain ed that way e ver since: A symbiosis of the two power s wher eby Western financial supp ort for Russia's ailing economy has been channeled into the pock ets of the internat ional banke rs via the companies they control. W ith domes tic capitalism out lawed, revolut ionary Rus sia was right from the start a 'captured market' for the Western banke rs. This model has been used in coun try after country througho ut the world. All the banks in Russia wer e nationalized after the revolution ex cept the Petrograd branch of Rock efeller's Nation al City Bank. In 1922 the first Soviet 33 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"internationa l bank , the Rusk ombank , was created by a carte l of Tsarist, German, Swedish, American and Br itish bank ers. In exchange for Russian gold, a ste ady stream of large and l ucrat ive (i.e. no n-compe titive) contracts were award ed to British and Am erican businesses connected to Round Table. (9) Russia' s gold reserves were soon depleted therefore game could only continue with the support of the Western taxpay er. With the end of the U.S. Governm ent's Lend- Lease programme after WWII, which transfused $11 b illion in military aid to the Soviets, the bankers reverted to the core mechanism it has used to build foreign dictatorships: Bank loans. Wes tern (mostly American) taxpayers have bailed out the Soviets with hundreds of billions of dollars. Bef ore the Revolution, the Ukra ine was the bread bask et of Europe. Afterwards Russia could not produc e enough food to feed itself and has relied on millions of tons of subsid ized foo d imports from the West. As Lenin rec ogniz ed, the capitalists would have to make the rope with which th e communists could hang them. (10) The Western military-industrial complex helped to build East ern-Bloc heav y industry, from oil-drilling equipment to chemica l processing plants, a ir-traffic radar syste ms, equipment to produce precis ion bearings, he licopter engines, laser techn ology, truck plants and nuc lear power plants. The German company, Junker s Aircraft , literally creat ed Soviet air power. Ackn owledgin g this apparent contradictio n betwe en geo- politics and i nternational business, Secretary of the Navy, John Lehman, addr essed the graduat ing class at An napolis in 1983: Within weeks, many of you will be looking across just hundreds of feet of water at some of the most modern technology ever invented in Ame rica. Unfortunately, it is on Soviet ships. (11) These facts dem onstrate that the Cold War and p ost-Cold War era concepts are invalid in terms of economics. The same financial system has always operate d. The change of communists to 'social demo crats' after the fall of the Berlin Wall was simply a name chan ge aimed at persuading the Western public to believe that the world is becoming more liberal and demo cratic. I n fact, the bankers now own everything of significance in commun ist and capit alist coun tries alike. It is no coincidence that the purported dem ise of the Soviet Union began at the end of the 1980s to coinc ide with the admi ssion of the Soviet Union i nto the World Bank/ IMF club. According to the World Bank's website: It was only after radical changes had been made in the country's policy in the late 1980s that the Soviet leadership began to show interest in establishing ties with the World Bank and the IMF. The meeting of the Group of Seven in Londo n in 1991 resulted in the admission of the Soviet Union to these international organizations as an associate member. (12) Rather than a change of policy, this was actually putting the same old policy into high gear. Senior oligarchs in the commun ist party and the KGB simply stole the country' s oil and gas industries during the economic chaos of the 1990s. More of Russia' s asse ts are now op en to foreign buye rs. Witness BP's recent deal to merge its Russian o il assets with TN K, a big private oil comp any joint ly own ed by billionaires Mikhail Fridman and V iktor Vekselberg. The BP deal gives the combined company an enterprise value of around $18 b illion. Russia n ow has one of the largest num ber of billionaires in the world and pos sibly the highest billionaire-to-GDP ratio in the world acco rding to Forbes Magazine.

(14) In his book Globalization and its Discontents former World Ban k chief economist, Joseph Stiglitz, desc ribes how the privatization programme in Russia led to a robber baron econom y and a catastrophic decli ne in GDP. Su rprisingly, Stiglitz views this as yet another sorry mistake by an i deologically mot ivated World Bank/ IMF. By 1992 $50 b illion in loans and a id from various west ern sources rained down on the former Soviet state s only to disappear without trace. In 1998 a Group -of -Seven/ IMF meeting authorized a $2 2 billion bailout. In 1999 it was discovered $20 billion had been stolen by Russian offic ials. (15) Amnes ty International currently has a major campa ign for basic human r ights in Russia. Torture is still institutionalized, anyone, even a child, who is taken into police custo dy for questioning is at ri sk of torture and i ll-treatment. Methods of police torture comm only reporte d include beat ings, electric shock s, rape, the use of gas masks to induce near- suffocation, and ty ing detainees in painful posit ions. Up to a million men, women and ch ildren are in prisons and p re-trial detention centre s in the Russian Fede ration, many are held in conditions that amoun t to cruel, inhuman and de grading treatment. C onditions are particularly harsh in the pre-trial detention centres owing to chronic over crowding .

The West essentially promised white leader s in South Africa that they would be allowed to continue pract icing aparthe id if they would stop arming Rhodesia in her war against comm unism. Between 1979 and 19 80, Rhodesia fell into Marxist dictatorship u nder Mugab e and had i ts nam e changed to Zimbabwe. (1) The World Bank prov ided loans to Mugabe up unt il May 2000 . (2) This is not an academic issue since millions face starvation because of Mugab e's Marxist policy of seizing the nation's farms. Om inously, Mugabe has turned to communist China to run farms in Zimbabwe. (3) In the 1980 s the world saw starving ch ildren in Ethiopia, but what they did not realize was that th is was a planned famine. The Marxist regime of Mengist u Haile Mariam un dertook nationalization of agriculture and m assiv e popu lation resettlement program modeled on Stalin and Mao 's starvation programmes in the 1930s and 40s which killed m illions. Me anwhile the World Bank continued to send Mengistu millions of dollars, much of it intended for the ministry of agriculture undertakin g the resettlement progr amme. (4)(5) The Wall St. Journal recently report ed on a study by the The Free Africa Foundation which con cluded that, In country after coun try in Africa, there has been no accountability in the use of World Bank loans... Billions in World Bank loans have been embezzled in Africa and rarely anyone is held accountable and prose cuted. (6) It come s as no surpr ise then that by i ts own ad mission, the World Ban k's purported policy of strength ening African free market economies by lending $50 billion for 'Structural Adju stment programs' and other projects over the past thirty years has been an abj ect failure. That's becaus e their real purpose was the exact opposite: The destruct ion of the property rights and the creation of socialist dictatorships. Wh at else could possibly have happ ened after handing over $50 billion to undemoc ratic gove rnments with no accountability? Given a p olitical system that i s based upon a patronage system and governmen ts run by uniformed bandi ts, the commitment to reform is almost non-existent as genuine economic reform would be politically suicidal. The result is a 'reform charad e,' where \"reforming\" g overnment s take one step forward and three steps backward. (7) The Bank's own reports in the 1980 s reveale d that i t played a major role in natio nalizing the developme nt proc ess throughout the Third World . Regarding these so-called harsh conditio nalities imposed by the structural adjustme nt loans, a 1985 confident ial bank report by leading development experts concluded that 'the SAL' s seemingly hard and a ll-encompassing condit ionality is largely illusory'. 38 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The bank and some proponen ts of foreign a id claim that a wave of privatization swept the Third Wo rld but actu ally 'privatization was almost all talk'. World Bank loans either go directly t o the recip ient governm ent or must be guaranteed by the governm ent. So, by inevitably increasing the politicization of Third Wo rld economies, World Bank aid was the economic tranqu ilizer dart wh ich create d a weaker domestic market for the foreign m ultinationa ls to feed on. (8) LATIN AMERICA By 1982 a lmost every Third Wo rld gov ernment was runn ing behind on its payments and L atin America was no exception. Over the next seven years, multi- billion dollar bailout package s failed to stem the econom ic decline. That's becau se they were used to build cumbersome nationalized industries at the expense of the private sector. For examp le, the west ern banks funded large govern ment run companies such as Petroleo Brasilerio S.A. i n Brazil and Petroleus Mexicano s in Mexico. By 1990 these companies were failing miserably and d ragging the rest of the economy down with them. Braz il was unab le to pro duce enough petrol and Mexico became a food importer. Brazil is now controlled by t he military and governmen t run comp anies consu me 65% of all industrial investment. Exactly the same process brought Argentina's economy to its knees. It had an ex panding middle class until its gove rnment became the recipie nt of massive loans from the World Bank and U .S. comme rcial banks during the 1980s. By 1989 i nflation averaged 5000% and t housan ds of corporate bankruptc ies followed. Governm ent figures show ed that in 2002 , about 100,000 people dropped out of the middle class each week to become the new poor. A country that on ly 10 years earlier had Lati n America's highest standar d of living was now on a level with Jama ica; half of Argentina's 37 mi llion people lived below t he poverty level. The Governm ent had su bsidy programmes for about 2 mi llion malnourish ed Argentines, but m illions more got nothing. Some subsisted by scave nging through garbage. (10) (11) Furthermo re the West has supp lied ph ysical weapons for military governmen ts to spend their free money on. Br itain is the world's second largest arms exporte r after the U.S. wi th 20% market share. (12) A U.S. mi litary training school, the Scho ol of the Americas, has trained many o f the worst human ri ghts violators and d ictators in variou s Latin American countries, including Roberto D'Aubiss on from El Salvador and M anuel Norieg a of Panama . (13) ASIA Joseph Stiglitz's discussion of the role of bankruptcy laws in the 1997 Asian financial crisis reveals how the IMF deliberately undermined domestic property rights. Here the bankers exploited the abse nce of the legal framework for implement ing trustee ships when large numbe rs of firms were going ban krupt. The IMF encouraged the state to get involved in restruct uring the comp anies, i.e. telling them how to run them selves instead of sortin g out who really owns the firm. Countries such as Thailand followed their adv ice and l anguished whilst Korea and M alaysia ignored it and prosp ered.

Li beral democracy and the free market had been strang led. Now for the second play: The sell off. The directive for the sell off came from the World Bank and I MF at the end of the 1980s as shown by World Bank docume nts signed by James Wolfens en and leaked to a BBC invest igative journali st, Greg Palast. T he World Bank flew in their teams who dictated their p lans, an average of 111 conditions in a pre- written documen t, to each nation's finance minister. If he refused he would be denied any further loans and the life blood which had su stained his governme nt would be cut. These condit ions included selling off the natura l reso urces and nat ional industries to foreign mu ltinationals. In the case of Argentina, they requ ired the natio n to give up i ts gas water and o il to Vivend i, Rep sol, Enron and a fe w other multinationals. In 198 8 Jeb Bush made a call to an Argent ine senat or asking h im to sell a gas pipeline to Enron at one fifth of its mark et value. In return, a percentage of the discount would be deposited in the senator's Swiss bank account. The process has been called 'br iberization' rather than privatisation. (15) The Water Baron s report for the Center for Public Integrity dea ls in-depth with the sale of natio nal water supplies. \"Surgery without anesthe sia,\" was how Menem described his policies in 1989 as he set out to mak e Argentina on e of the world's leading models for privatisation . Faced with rampant i nflation - caus ed by the banks and who were suddenly \"re luctant\" to make further loans - Menem won passage of the National Admin istrative Reform Law, which d eclared a stat e of economic emergency and ga ve him the power to privatize public utilities by decree. As a result World Bank money came flowing back to Arge ntina. On 18 Dec. 1990, the World Bank approved a loan ( a bribe) of $300 m illion for \"The new adjustme nt projects in Argentina\" . Non e applauded louder than Santi ago Soldat i, a bus inessm an and clo se Menem ally who would end up as the lead Argentine partner in the privatisation of water. Soldat i later sold hi s interest in the water comp any, mak ing a t idy $10 0 million in the proc ess. In 1993 , the Governm ent granted a 30- year concession to run the water system to Aguas Argentinas a con sortium controlled by two Frenc h corp orate giants, C ompagn ie Générale des Eaux (now Vivendi )and Lyonn aise des Eaux ( now Suez). Soon after, the World Bank declared the Buen os Aires privatisation an overwhelm ing success, and made it a model for privatisation s of water that f ollowed in the Philippines, In donesia, Austral ia and Sout h Africa. (16) The invest igatio n showed that the enormous expansion of these water companies could not ha ve been possible without the World Bank and oth er internationa l financial institutions, such as the IMF, the Inter- American Development Bank, the Asian Developm ent and the Europe an Bank for Reconstruction. In countries such as South Africa, Argentina , Philippines and Indone sia, the World Bank has been advising the leaders to 'commer cialize' their utilities as part of an overal l bank po licy of privatisation and 'free -market' economics. (17) The World Bank calculates that privatisation proj ects in develop ing co untries in 2002 alone totaled (U.S) $24 b illion. (18) Having beco me impatient w ith the sluggish pace of progre ss on this issue, the World Bank launched an internet toolkit for privatisation in developin g coun tries, providing on- line adv ice on how to sell off highway s, water , waste systems, ports, and telecoms industr ies!

Chan cellor Gordon Brown said in a recent speech that \"there should be no principled objection to PFI expanding into new areas, such as the provision of employment and t raining services, the renovation of schools and colleges, major projects or urban regeneration and social housing.(4) The most ironic PPP i nitiative is the 'Strat egic Transfer of the Estate to The Private Sector ' (STEPS) by the Inland Revenue (IRS equivalent).

'Money is power'. Well, to be precise, it's the gap between the rich and poor that counts. The objective of the elite is to maintain the capit alist structur e as it is with one vital difference. Ther e will be no middle class in the New World Orde r. Under public-pri vate partnership, the middle class, free markets, and con sumer choice will be replaced with a neo -feudal society in which the Money Trust dictates to an impoverished popu lace through a supr anation al technocracy. This is international socia lism, run for the benefit of the financial elite who own the economy and con trol the emerging continenta l Politburos. The polite nam e for it is 'The Third Way', but l ess deferential commentators call it 'corporate fascism '. The corporations need government to restrict consum er choice in the market place, al lowing the cartel to determine what we can buy, sell, or even do in our own home s. The 'Third Way' is the path t o utopia for our self- appointed philosopher kings, advocated by the likes of Bill Clinton, T ony Blair, and Gerhard Schroder - their senior political puppe ts. Ther e is no differenc e betwee n ostensib ly right and l eft wi ng political parties about the eventual destinat ion, even if they appear to be travelling at d ifferent speeds towards it. Real power, then, is achieved when the ruling class cont rols the material essentials of life, granting and w ithholding them as if they were privileges, as George Orwell refle cted: From the moment when the machine first m ade its appearance it was clear t o all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and therefore to a great extent for human inequa lity, had disappeared. If the machine were used deliberate ly for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and diseas e could be eliminated within a few generations But it was also clear that an all-around increase in wealth threatened the destruction... of a hierarchical society. In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough t o eat, lived in a house with a bathr oom and a refrigerator, and possessed a motorcar or even an airplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappea red. If it once became general, wealth would confer no distinction. Such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn t o think for themselves; and w hen once they had d one this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minorit y had n o function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance... It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship because a general state of scarcity increases the impor tance of small privileges and th us magn ifies the distinction 48 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"between one group and another... The social atmo sphere is that of a besiege d city, where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty. The differen ce betwe en riches and poverty is often the differen ce betwe en pleasur e and pa in. Orwell concluded this idea in the tortu re episode at the end of 1984. How does one man assert his power over another, Wins ton?' By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and n ot his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation... Progress in our world will be progress towards more pain. (1) In The Creature from Jekyll Island , G. Edwar d Griffin discusses the relationship betwe en 1984 and The Report From Iron Mountain: On the Possibility and De sirability of Peace by Leonard Lewin. It has never been establ ished whether or not this report published in 1966 was written by a U .S. governmen t think tank or if it was an elabor ate political satire. On 26 Novembe r,1967, the report was reviewed in the book section of the Washingt on Post by He rschel McLandress, which was the pen name for Harvard profes sor John Kenneth Galbraith. Galbraith, who also had been a member of the Council on Foreign Relat ions, sa id that he knew firsthand of the report's authenticity becaus e he had been invited to participate in it. Although he was unab le to be part of the official group, he was consulted from time to time and had b een asked to keep the project a secret. Furth ermore, while he doubted the wisdom of letting the public know about the report, he agreed totally with its con clusions. For the purposes of Griffin's comparison, it makes no differen ce whether it is a satire. T he report credits Orwe ll for many of its ideas and i t is a blueprint for what has occurred since. Importantly , it agre ed with Orwe ll's view that poverty is a prerequis ite for a hierarch ical socie ty: The continuance of the war system must be assured, if for no other reason, among others, than to preserve whatever quali ty and degree of poverty a society requires as an incentive , as well as to maintain the stability of its internal organization of power. The econ omic destru ction of the world's middle class is well advanced. Personal debt, bankruptc ies, and unemp loyment are soaring wh ile investments are destr oyed in the stock-market and i ncomes decline. Like Manchurian Candi dates, the Western middle class have played their essential part i n creating the techn o-bureaucrac y of the new feuda lism wh ich w ill enslave them . This chapter describes seven significant m ethods being used to reduce living standards around the world. These are: 1. money supply and taxat ion; 2. free trade; 3.free mov ement of labour; 4. environmental ism; 5. wars; 6. the criminal justice system; and 7. disease. 7.2 MONETARY AND FISCAL POLIC Y Stock cultivates land; stock employs labour . A tax which tended to drive away stock from any particular country, would so far tend to dry up every source of revenue, both to the sovereign and t o the society. 49 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"- Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations THE BURDE N OF TAXATIO N In 1900 the combined national and l ocal tax bur den in the U.S. was a mere 5.7% of income. By year 2000 it reach ed an a ll time high of 33%. (2) The U.K.'s tax burden has grown from 8.5 % of GDP in 1900 to 31% in 1963 and t o a peak of 39% in 1982 . It is now around 38%. (3)(4) The E.U.'s tax b urden now averages 40.5%. (5) The burden of taxatio n on middle income bracket families has grown in line with the overall increas e. In 1958 the medi an two-earner American family ($68,605) paid 17.9% of its income in taxes. In 1998 that percen tage was 37.6 % in 1998. In year 2000 , taxes claimed a greater share of the med ian two- income family's income (39.0 perc ent) than food (8.9 perc ent), clothing (3.9 percent), housing ( 15.9 percent), and t ransportation (6.9 percent), combined. (6) The U.S n ow has the same household taxatio n levels as Britain reach ed at the end of the 1970s and wher e they remain today: between 35 and 40% of household income. (7) HIGH LABO UR TAXE S One of the most confounding ec onom ic trends in the United States during the past 20 years has been the relative stagnat ion of workers' real wage s. One of the primary r easons for flat wages is that t axes and o ther government mandates on employer s have been expand ing steadi ly, crowding out worker take- home pay. Comb ined Federal Inc ome taxes and pay roll taxes increas e the average cost of employing a m anufacturing wo rker by 2 8%. (8) In Europe the situation is even worse, but due to the rigidity of the labour market it has caus ed high unemp loyment rather than dr iving wag es down. I n 1970 , the tax-to-GDP ratio of the E.U. was similar to America but then it grew by 8 perc entage points largely due to an e xpansio n of the welfare state. T he tax hike was largely imposed upon labour. The average effective tax rate on labour is about 10 perce ntage points higher in Europe than in the U.S. wi th the exception of the U.K, Ireland and Portuga l whos e rates are similar. The average effective tax rate imposed on labour in 1997 reach ed 38% compared to 24% in the U.S. This largely accou nts for the high unemp loyment rate. (9) THE HIDDE N TAX: INFLATION Inflation is another form of taxat ion. It is an i ndirect tax there fore it falls as heavi ly on the poor as it does on the rich. In the early stages of inflation, the business class actually benefits from the easy credit . The governm ent cause s inflation by go ing into debt there fore is one of the major collectors of this tax. As described at the beginning of this book, the central b ank prints money for the governmen t to borrow. As John Maynard Keyn es explained: Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscat e, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscat e, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impov erishes many, it actually enriches some...

A substantial part of the confiscat ion is effected by taxation. But the welfare statists were quick to recognize that if they wished to retain political power, the amou nt of taxation had to be limited and t hey had t o resort to programs of massive deficit spending, i.e., they had to borrow money, by issuing government bonds, to finance welfare expenditures on a large scale... The abando nment of the gold standa rd made it possible for the welfare statists to use the banking system as a means to an unlimited expansio n of credit.... As the supply of money (of claims) increases relative to the supply of tangible assets in the economy, prices must eventually rise. Thus the earnings saved by the productive members of the society lose value in terms of goods. When the economy's books are finally balanced , one finds that loss in value represents the goods purchased by the government for welfare or other purposes with the money proceeds of the government bonds financed b y bank credit expansion. - Alan Greenspan, Gold and Economic Freedom, The Objectivist, July 1966 (10) This new money can be expanded up to ten times when it pass es through comm ercial banks theref ore their private borrowers are also tax col lectors as Congre ssman Ron Paul suggests: An astute stock investor or home builder can make millions in the boom phase of the business cycle, while the poor and those dependent on fixed incomes can't keep up with the rising cost of living .(11) The inflationary e ffect of lending is exace rbated when borrowers get into troub le and the debts are \"rolled ov er\", \"re-scheduled\" and e ventually \"bai led out\". A non- performing loan cause s inflation becaus e the freshly pr inted money injected into the economy via the borrowing corp orations and individuals has not been acco mpanied by a suff icient increase in product ion to keep up re payments. There have been some major corpo rate bailouts in the U.S. amount ing to billions of dollars: Penn Centra l railroad and L ockheed in 1970, Commonwe alth Bank of Detroit 1972 , New York City 1975 , Chrys ler 1978 , First Pennsylvan ia Bank of Philadelphia 1979 and Ch icago' s Cont inenta l Illinois in 1982 . All of these were saved from bankr uptcy by Congr ess acting as lender of last w ith the guar antee of freshly pr inted money from the Fed. This is inflationary not just in the final stage where money is sou rced from the Fed but in the first, second and all the other intermediary stages on the way t o default. (12) The main event in the bail-out Supe r Bowl has not been played at home. It's the game between Third World govern ments and the IMF/World Bank . All of these non-performing l oans to foreign governm ents caus e domestic inflation when the new money eventual ly returns to our shores in exch ange for our product s and se rvices. Loans to most Third Wo rld gove rnmen ts started to fail by 1982 . By 1983 thi rd wor ld governments owed $300 billion to bank s and $4 00 billion to west ern gove rnments.

In 1982 i t owed $85 b illion to the banks, an i nflationary loss to the American taxpayer which is being sust ained to this day b y central banks who initially made new loans and eventual ly underwrote almost the entire debt. In 198 2 the IMF organ ized a $4. 5 billion loan from West ern central banks, and in 1989, a fu rther $7.5 billion. This is the roll-over and resch edule play, whos e purpose is to enab le interest payments to conti nue on the original non-performing com mercial loans and prevent them going i nto defau lt and bankrupt ing the comm ercial bank s. Howev er the day of recko ning i nevitably arrives: Mexico could no longer afford even the interest payments. On 31 January 1995 , President Clinton, acting independently of Congre ss, authorized a $50 b illion package of loan g uarantees: $20 b illion from the U.S Exchange Stabilization Fund, $17 .8 billion from the IMF, $10 b illion from the Bank of Internation al Settlements and $3 billion from comm ercial banks. (15) Joseph Stiglitz declared one of the functions of the cent ral bank / IMF/World Bank to be a bank er's welfare system. In relation to the $95 b illion bailout pack age during the 1997 Asian crisis: The money served another function: it enabled the countries to provide dollars to the firms t hat h ad borrowed from western bankers to repay the loan s. It was thus, in part, a bailout to the intern ational banks as much as it was to the country. (16) Whilst the commercial banks profit from the interest rates, which ar e often vastly inflated for debtor governme nts, the Western taxpayer pays off the loans through inflation at home. This system is designed to go on forever, draining the West of its wealt h in order to build socialist dictatorships abro ad and enr ich the banki ng elite. The total foreign debt of low and middle income countries rose from $1.4 trillion in 1990 to $2.3 trillion in 2001. (17) To summarize inflation: There are three bands of thieves who work as a cartel . The central banks acting as lender of last resort have enabled the comm ercial banks and the gove rnment to expand the money supp ly at our cost by increasing g overnment deficit spending , sust aining non- performing loans and bailing out major corp orate failures. Sin ce 1971 when Nixon destr oyed the last remnants of the Gold St andar d, the U.S. national debt has increase d from $408 billion to $6.8 trillion, a 1600% increas e. In 197 1, M3 money supp ly was $776 billion; today it stands at $8 .9 trillion, a 1100% increase. During that ti me the dollar has lost almost 80% of its purchasing power. (18) In addition to all the other state and federal taxes, the hapless taxpayer has paid another 5% per year in inflation. (19) A 1999 U K Parliamentary report shows that i nflation in Britain acce lerated after WWII. The pre-war a nnual inflation rate was about 2.5% and t he post -war rate averaged 6%. Over the whole century, the Pound lost 98.5% of its purchasing power. (20) It is no coincidence that during this period the gap between rich and poo r and the size of governme nt has grown significantly. DEPR ESSIONS: MONETARY AND FISC AL TIGHTENING 52 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" In Globalizat ion and its Discont ents , Joseph Stiglitz desc ribes how the contra ctionary policies of the IMF exac erbated the 1997 east Asia cr isis. In any economic downt urn, there is a standard governm ent respons e: stim ulate demand by either cutting taxes, increase expenditu res, or loosen monetary policy. The IMF pushed exactly the oppo site cours e. By continuing to advo cate contra ctionary policies the IMF caus ed the cont agion to spread from one country to the next as exports decreased. The IMF monetary reme dy was to impose interest rate hikes of more than 25%, throw ing fuel onto the fire. (21) This had the effect of driving even more capital out of the country as it pushed companies towards bank ruptcy. Furthermore it imposed restruc turing i n the banki ng sect or which closed down any ban ks with significant n on-performing lo ans. In Indone sia, s ixteen private banks were closed which cause d a run on the rema ining pr ivate banks and a re treat of capital to the state run banks. The effect on the Indon esian banking syste m and t he economy was disastrou s. (22) Riots followed when welfare, esp ecially food and fue l subsid ies for the poor, were cut back. Busines smen and the ir families were targeted. This exacerbated the retreat of capit al out of the country since riots do not restore business confidence. According t o Greg palast's interviews with Stiglitz, \"IMF riots\" were virtually written into the 111 conditionalities form ulated at the end of the 1980s. One of the IMF condiona lities on Ecuador was to raise the price of cooking gas by 80% at the same time as they were cutting back pensions and l aying off governm ent workers. Poor Ande an Indians came down from the hills and set fire to cars in the capital bringing troops onto the streets. (23) In Argentina, when the bank s put their interest rates up to 21- 70%, the governm ent had to change the law agai nst loan-shark ing becaus e the bank s would have been in breach of it. Stiglitz laments that deepe ning a re cession not only cause s more pain today but a lso more pain tomorrow. An economy which has a de ep recession may grow faster as it recovers, but i t never makes up for lost time. The deeper today's recession , the lower incom e is likely to be twenty years from now. (24) The IMF was not the first to use fiscal tightening as a we apon of economic warfare. In 1920- 21, America went through an agr icultural depre ssion. Th is was caused solely by the monet ary policy of the Governm ent and Fede ral Reserve. The farm ers had borr owed large amounts of money to buy l and at the instance of the governm ent. They had bec ome very prosp erous. Howev er, with an eye on closing down the smaller ban ks in the South West, the Wall St. contr olled Fed decided to drast ically cut credit i n May 1920. Unab le to keep up repayments, thousand s of farmers were bank rupted and b rought down their local banks with them. G. Edward Gr iffin des cribes this episod e as \"Country- Duck Dinner in New York.\" (25) Howeve r, this was just the starte r before the main cours e. At the behes t of the Wall St. Mon ey Trust, the Open Mark et Committee was form ed in 1922 , to coordinate the purchase of Treasury bonds by the twelve regional Reserve banks. From 1923 onwards low in terest rates caused new money to flood into the econ omy causing a massive speculative boom on the stock market. By 1929 , half of retail transactions were on credit . (26) On 9 August 1929, the Fed started selling Treasury bonds in the open market and rever sed its easy credit policy. It raised interest rates on loans to commer cial banks to 6% and the money suppl y rap idly contracted; specu lators who had borrow ed money to purchase shares could no longer keep up repayments to their brokers.

Whilst taxat ion pol icy is overt, a hidden transfer of wealth is achieved by monetary policy- the public endure inflation wh ilst the debtor governmen ts grow in size and t he banke rs grow rich col lecting interest on the loans that caus e it.

(28) Three months befor e, Sir Jame s Goldsmi th, a Br itish billionaire,gave a spee ch to the U.S. se nate in which he warned abou t the effect global free trade would have on Western emp loyment and wage levels. (29) Goldsmith argued that G ATT and the theories on which it is base d were flawed. If implemented, it would impov erish and d estabilize the industrialized wor ld wh ile at the same time cruel ly ravag ing the third wor ld. The principle of global free trade is that any thing can be manufactu red anywhere in the world to be sold anywher e else. That means that t hese new entrant s into the world economy are in direct comp etition w ith the workforc es of developed coun tries. In mo st developed countries, the cost to an average manufact uring comp any of paying its wor kforce is an amo unt equa l to betwee n 25 p ercent and 30 p er cent of sales. If such a company decides to ma intain in its home country only its head office and sa les force, while transferring its product ion to a low-cost area, it will save about 20 percent of sales volume. For every French emp loyee, a company could have recruited 47 V ietname se. Many economists believe that t he growth in service industries will compensate for lost jobs in manufactur ing. Howev er even service industries will be subjected to substantial transfers of employment to low-cost areas. On the other hand , the real cost to consumers of cheap er goods will be that they will lose their jobs, get paid less for their work and ha ve to face higher taxes to cover the socia l cost of increased unemp loyment. According to figures published by the U.S. Depar tment of Labor, s ince 1973 real hourly and weekly earnin gs, in inflation-adjusted dollars, have already dropped resp ectively by 13 .4 54 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"per cent and 19 .2 pe r cent, and that was before the 1995 GATT negotiat ions known as the Uruguay Ro und. If 4 billion people enter the same world market for labour and o ffer their work at a fract ion of the price paid to people in the developed world, it is obvious that such a massive increas e in supp ly will reduce the value of labour. Organ ized labour will lose practically all its negot iating power. Regiona l free trade zones should on ly be establ ished betwe en countries with similar levels of economic developm ent. The 1957 Treaty of Rom e between France, German y, Italy, Belg ium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg created the European Econo mic Commun ity, the largest free market in the world. Within the EEC, there would be no tariffs, no barriers, and a free and com petitive mark et. Trade with natio ns outside the EEC wou ld be subject to a sin gle tar iff. This concept was known as commu nity pref erence. In other words, priority wou ld be given to European jobs and in dustry. About twenty years ago, qu ietly, the techno crats who run Europe started to alter thi s fundamental pr inciple and m ove progres sively towards international free trade. Ever since, unemployment in Europe has swol len despite growth in GNP. The 1992 Treaty of Maastricht enshrines this change and m akes global free trade one of the fundame ntal principles on which the new Europe is to be built. Regarding the economic success of Hong Kong, Sou th Korea and T aiwan , special economic concessions granted by the West combined with the ir cheap and sk illed labour made them succ essful. Over the past thirty years the balance of trade between thes e countries and the West has resulted in a tra nsfer of tens of billions of dollars to them. Howeve r, a ba lance of trade in monetary terms can disguise huge job losses becau se, as Mr Goldsmith noted, he could emp loy 47 Vietnames e for the price of one Frenchman. JOB LOSSES DUE TO NAFTA The U.S. has lost millions of manufactur ing job s due to a grow ing trade deficit over the past three decad es. This trend accelerated when The North Atlantic Fre e Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed by the U.S., Canada and M exico, designed to remove tariff barriers over a fifteen year period. NA FTA eliminated 766 ,030 actual and pot ential U.S. job s between 1994 and 2000 b ecause of the rapid growth in the net U.S. export deficit with Mexico and Canada . The majority of the job losses were in the manufactur ing se ctor so worker s who found jobs in the service sector are paid on average 23% less. Almost all new American jobs being create d are in this sec tor and wages in the manufactur ing sec tor are kept down due to the threat of job relocation overseas. The growth in U.S. trade and t rade deficits has put downward pressu re on the wages of \"unsk illed\" (i.e., non- college-educate d) worker s in the U.S., especially those with no more than a high school degree. This group repres ents 72.7% of the total U.S. workfor ce and includes most middle and l ow wage work ers. A large body of economic resea rch has conclu ded that trade is responsible for at least 15-25% of the growth in wage inequality in the U.S. (U.S. Trade Deficit Review Comm ission 2000 , 110- 18). (30)( 31) In some areas of the U.S. the loss of manufactur ing jobst o Mexico has caused disturbing levels of poverty. Since George Bush won Ohio in the 2000 president ial elect ions, the state has lost one in six of its manufactur ing jobs. A string of local factories have relocated to Mexico in the last two years. Two million of the state 's 11 mi llion popu lation res orted to food char ities in 2002, an increase of more than 18% from 2001.

J obs done by financial analysts, architectu ral draf ters, telemarketer s, accountants, claims adjusters, home loan processors and ot hers at higher levels of the labour food chain are being farmed out to work ers in other countries. \"We're not just talking abou t call-center jobs, but a ll kinds of jobs,\" says Delo itte Consult ing analyst Chr istopher Gentle. \"It doesn't leave any p art of the corp oration untouched.\" Major U.S. companies, including such giants as IBM, Micro soft and Proct er & Gamb le, are leading the pack. Ten s of thousands of jobs already have been shipped out, and ana lysts project that mi llions more will go -- just as the fragile economy attempts a rebound. \"We see it as a threat to America's middle-class work force, in terms of wages and benefits,\" says Marcu s Courtney, president of Washington Alliance of Technology Workers in Seattle. \"The service sector is not immune to the forces of globalization. We're talking about highly skilled, best- paying jobs. It's raising the concern of worker s.\" (34) In the U.K., HSBC Bank just announc ed that it is shipping 4000 back office jobs from the U.K. to Asia. By 2006 , that w ill have increased to 700 0, 13% of its current U.K. wo rkforce. (35) 7.4 OPEN BORDERS Whilst free-trade allows capital to travel to developing co untries in search of cheap labour, la x immigration controls have allowed chea p labour to trave l to the West in searc h of capital. The immigrant popu lation i n the United State s has increas ed to 33 m illion, a five percent increas e in the last two years. The new Census Bureau data sho w that i mmigrants account for 11.8 perce nt of the U.S. population. In California 27% of the population are foreign born. The immigrant popu lation in the U.S. is now larger than the entire popu lation of Canada . (36) 9 million Mexicans make up 30% of thes e foreign born residents. Over a third of them are illegals. (37) BLUE COLLA R WORKERS Through out the economic boom of the 90s, when the unemployment rate got as low as 3.9 perc ent, economist s marve led at the U.S. ec onom y's ability to grow jobs without sparking wage- led inflation. Many speculat ed that the waves of low- paid immigrants had created a \"saf ety valve,\" keeping average wages low enough for the economy to grow without an increase in prices. An article in the Labor Departm ent's \"Monthly Lab or Review\" has laid out just how important those foreign- born workers were for the U.S economy: foreign-born wor kers earned about 75.6 cents for every dollar earned by the native born in 2000 .

Also an e stimated 1,880,000 American workers are displaced from their jobs every year by immigration. (40)( 41) The American food and agr iculture system has become depende nt on foreign- born workers, a substantial number of whom are illegals. Until 15 or 20 years ago, meatpacking p lants in the United States were staffed by highly paid, unionized employees who earned about $18 an hour, adjust ed for inflation. Today, the processing and pack ing pl ants are largely staffed by low-paid non- union wor kers from Mexico and Guatema la. Many of them start at $6 an hour. A few years ago, the Immigration and N aturalization Service estimated that about 25 perc ent of meatpacking wo rkers in the Midwest were probab ly illegals. (42) A governmen t study estimated that near ly 40 percent of farm labourers are illegals. WHITE COLL AR WORKERS Immig ration has also supp ressed wages of white collar work ers because U.S immigration has granted huge num bers of work ing visas. M ore than 10 0,000 American comput er programm ers are unem ployed but when those who are underemployed or working i n other jobs becau se they cannot find programm ing jobs, the total grows to about half a m illion. At the same time, more than 450,000 H-1B visa workers are employed as programmers in the United States.

(51) Howev er this is noth ing compar ed to the prob lem looming from the newly enlarged E.U. The floodgates for cheap labour opened on 1st May 2004 when 10 former Easter n Bloc countries join the E.U. mak ing their 73 mi llion citizens eligible to work anywhere within the EEA. Created in 1992 The European Econo mic Area (EEA) consist s of the 15 memb er states of the European Union (EU) plus Norway, Iceland and L iechtenstein. There is free movement of people, goods and se rvices within the area. So long as nationals of the countries are exercising the ir freedoms under these the various treaties, they are not strictly subject to immigration control, and may work or set up in business without restrict ion. Thes e rights extend also to member s of the househ olds of EEA natio nals acc ompanying them to the U.K. . 13 countries have applied to beco me new member s: 10 of these countries -Cyprus, the Czech Republ ic, Estonia, Hungary , Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Slovak Republic, and S lovenia joined on 1st May 2004 . They are currently known by the term \"acceding countries\". Bulgaria and Ro mania ho pe to do so by 2007, and T urkey is currently negotiat ing its membership. (52) The E.U. estimates that around 335, 000 pe ople will migrate each year from Eastern Europe after the barriers to free movement come down, i ncluding 100,000 workers. This may be a deliberate understate ment of the tidal wave of cheap labour which is about to demol ish wage levels in Western Europe . (53) Anothe r revolution is quietly tak ing pl ace in anot her aspec t of immigration aimed directly at the middle class. The Government has been clamping down on illegal immigration but massiv ely expanding legal migration for skilled wor kers, most noticeably through expanding the work permit scheme to abou t 200,000 people this year. David Blunkett, the Hom e Secretary, has said he is proud to have produc ed the largest work perm it programme of any co untry. These workers will be able to bring the ir fam ilies and , on past form, m ost will be accep ted for settlement after 4-5 ye ars if they so wish. This massive expansion of the work permit schem e theref ore repre sents a major new avenue of immigration. The Governme nt has also set up the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme, which has so far brought in 3,000 of the of the world 's brightest and best. The scheme makes it easie r for foreig n stude nts to carry on workin g in the U.K. after their cours e finishes. No doubt many w ill come from poor countries and w ill accept significantly lower salaries than nat ive work ers.

The authors concluded that, in the past, war has been the only reliable means to ach ieve that goal . Unde r world government, howev er, war wou ld be impossible so the challenge was to find other methods for controll ing popu lations and keeping them loyal to their leader s. It concluded that a suitable subst itute for war wou ld require a new enemy which pose d a frightful threat to survival. Neither the threat nor the enem y had to be real, they merely had to be believab le. Sev eral surro gates for war wer e considere d, including a staged space-alien invasion , but the only one holding real promise was the envir onmental pollution model. This was viewed as the most likely to succeed becaus e firstly, it could be related to observable condit ions such as smog and water pollution - in other word s, it would be based partly on fact and, therefore, believable. Sec ondly, predictions could b e made showing end-of-earth scenarios just as horrible as atom ic warfare . Accuracy in these pred ictions would not be important. Their purpose would be to frighten, not to inform . Not only does the envir onmental pollution model justify expansive and author itarian government, it also requ ires citizens to impover ish themselve s thereby widening the gap between leaders and follower s. Matching the Iron Mountain brief, part of the environme ntal m ovement aims to reduce living standar ds in the West, espe cially in the U.S..

The last chapter of this book prov es that, actually, the elite regard human b eings as Earth's primary contaminant . FINANCING ENVIRONMENTALISM A few years after the Report from Iron Mountain was published in 1966, the envir onmental move ment was hijacked by the bank ing car tel. Instead of staying focused on scient ific study of cons ervatio n, it becam e a catch- all for a radica l political agenda, now spearh eaded by ex-KGB chief Mikhail Gorbachev and h is Western bank er colleague Steph en Rockefeller. (58) Dr Michael Coffman' s fascinat ing article Why Property Rights Matter, details the high-level funding of environmental ism: I n a dazzling display of raw power, foundations with inter locking directorates funded the Nature Conservancy in 1996 to the tune of $203 ,886, 056, or 60 percent of its annua l revenue. Initially the foundat ions banded together under the name Environmental Grantma kers Affinity Group of the Council on Foundations. Under the umbr ella of Rockefeller Fami ly Fund 13 6 foundatio ns formed the Environmental Grantmakers Association (EGA) in 1987 w hich has grown to over 200 b y the end of the twentieth century. Congressman Ric hard Pombo (R-CA ) claimed in 1999 t hat there are \"3,400 full time employees, including leade rs who often make $150,000 or more, as well as a small army of outside contractors such as scientist s, lobbyists, lawyers, and public affairs specialists\" in Washington DC. Citing a 1999 B oston Glob e article, Congressman Pombo said: ...\"foundations invest at least $400 million a year in environmental advocacy and r esearch. The large st environmental grant-maker, Pew Charitab le Trusts, give s more than $35 million annua lly to environme ntal groups \".....When the additional 2,300 foundat ions that donate to environment al activism are considered, plus the billion dollars or so contracted to environ mental organizations by various agencies of the federal government, the Boston Globe [ newspaper] estimates th e total funding for environmental activism to be around f our billion dollars annu ally!\".

Rockefeller Jr. brought the U.N. to Am erica by g ifting $8 m illion for the purchase of the land for the U.N. building in New York. Canad ian multi-billionaire and Rockefeller associate, Maurice Strong, was the first Director of the U.N. Environmental Program (UNEP) created after The Stockholm Confere nce, ('Earth Summ it 1') in 1972. Mr Strong was secretary general of all three Earth Summ its 1972 , 1992, and 19 97.

(66) RURAL CLEANSING Less than 5 p ercent of the U.S. is urban , but urban areas comprise 77.2 percent of the popu lation. The population density in the U.S. is only 77.7 people per square mile, compared to the U.K. which is 629 .4. The reas on the envir onmental lobby has been so succ essful in the U.S. since the 1970's is that the courts have general ly ruled in favour of the primacy of public use when judging property rights. In the spirit of Rousseau, the thrust of the 1972 Use of Land report suppor ted the prem ise that dev elopment rights of private property owners shou ld be censured by the governm ent. Environme ntal pro tection areas would be prote cted \"not by purchas e but through the police power of the federal governmen t.\" The Endangered Species Act was pass ed the following year, a key weapon for restricting pro perty rights. The plundering of rural America has gotten so bad that a Wall Street Journal editorial on 26 Ju ly 2001 , called it \"rura l cleans ing\". The WSJ cites the case in which the federal court forced the Bureau of Reclam ation to cut off irrigation water in April 2001 that unden iably belonged to 1400 farmers in the Klamath Basin Irrig ation Proje ct, a watersh ed straddl ing the California and O regon border. The action t urned their onc e lush green farm land t o swirling dust reminiscent of the Oklahoma dust bowl days of the 1930s Great Depr ession. The suit began in 1988 when two suck er fish we re listed as \"endanger ed\" under the Endangered Specie s Act of 1973 . The coho salmon was later added as a threatene d species. Citing the U.S. Endangered Specie s Act, Oregon District Judge Ann Aiken ruled in Federal Court on April 6, 2001, to give all the water to the endangered species. The decision was the result of a lawsuit brought by the Oregon Natura l Resources Counci l (ONRC).

It is to expunge humans from the countrysid e.\" Just as in the Klamat h basin example, the WSJ determined that, The strategy of these environmental groups is almost always the same: to sue or lobby the government into declaring rural areas off-limits to people who 61 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"live and w ork there. The tools for doing this are the Endangered Species Act and local preservation laws, most of which are so loosely crafted as to allow a wide leeway in their implementat ion. In some cases the owners loose their property outright. More often the environm entalists' g oal is to have restrictions placed on the land that either render it unusable or persuade owners to leave of their own accord. Congre ssman Richard Pom bo laments this attack on America's natura l resou rce-based industries: Federal policies implement ed as a result of environmental advocacy financ ed by private foundat ions are trampling on property rights. They are shutting down the tim ber indus try, the min ing industry and the oil and gas industry . These policies are creating mise ry in rural areas depend ent on resource production. Small comm unities and f amilies in rural areas are reeling, while environm ental groups are collecting rewards of six figure grants from rich, private foundations. Why is this sort of activity subsidized by the taxpayer? The land grab i s also being directed by the federal governm ent. President Clinton used the 1906 Ant iquities Act to set aside tens of millions of acres of federal la nd as natio nal monument s preve nting any comme rcial use. In 1998 h e initiated the Clean Water Actio n Plan wh ich wi thdraws thousan ds of miles of federal roads and a lso imposes buffe r zone s of natural habitat on private land along mi llions of miles of streams and r ivers. (68) Following the 1968 U.N. Confer ence on Man and th e Biosphere, the U.S. governme nt instituted their own program called Th e United States Man and the Biosph ere Progr am-U.S. M AB. There are currently 4 7 biospher e reserv es and 20 W orld Her itage Sites in America, as designated by the U.N.. The counties surrounding the biospher e reserves/World Heritage Sites are \"buffer zones.\" At some point there will be no human act ivity in the biospher es and the buffer zone s are to protect the biospher es wher e there will be limited hum an activ ity. (69) This plan first appeared as part o f The Wildlands Proje ct, a grandiose design t o transform 50% of the U.S. into a b iosphere cleansed of modern industry and pri vate property and the rest into buffer zones. The U.S. Senate came close to endorsin g this plan in 1994 when consid ering rat ifying the U.N. Biodiversity Treaty. At the eleventh hour it was pointed out that the study on which the Treaty was based , the 1994 G lobal Biodiversity Assessment, endorsed the Wildlands Project strategy. (70) The Biodiversity Treaty also propo ses an unacc ountable U.N. Truste eship Council to regulate any human act ivity that presents potentia l harm to biological diversity. With 1.8 million acres Ted Turner, billionaire and r adica l environmental ist, is now the largest land owner in America. Ac cording to Forbes Magazine , Despite his reputation as a die- hard conservationist, the cable pioneer makes plenty of money off his land. He sells bison meat to restaurants (including his own). He opened some of his New Mexico holdings to gas and coal explorat ion. Timber is harvested and sold.

Private land ownership is also a principal instrum ent of accumulation and concentration of wealth and therefore contributes to social injustice.. . Public control of land use is therefore indispensable . \"Smart growth\" advocates seek to pres erve land in a natura l or agricultural state by e ncourag ing individuals to live in denser communit ies that take up smaller tracts of land per housing un it. Such comm unities also encourage residents to rely mo re on walking or public transit than on car s for mobility, and they more closely mi x retail and ot her comme rcial facilities with residential units to foster easy access to jobs and shopping .

At least nineteen state s have state growt h-manage ment laws or task forces to prote ct farm land and open space. Dozen s of cities and counties have adopt ed urban growth boun daries to contain development and prevent the spread of urban ization to outlying and rural areas. Portland Oregon is a m odel for smart growth and since the 1970s it has had the most strin gent planning laws in the U.S..

This report not only app lies th e smart growth principle to future land use, but also to current land use by introducing t he idea of \"amor tization of non-conforming use s. \" This will requ ire the local governme nt to seize property without just compen sation where prope rty owner s fail to adjust the use of their property to fit revised zonin g ordinances or new plans for a pa rticular geographica l area in the community . (73) REGULATING CONSUMPTION One of the key concepts of the sustainab le development agenda is \"Fact or 10\". This theory propo ses expone ntial decrea se in resource use especially in OECD countries which are required to reduce mater ial consumption by 90%. (74) The 1994 st atement of the Factor Ten Club demands and end to private property : The process of dematerialization must invo lve a shift in thinking toward the 'life-cycle' approach, meaning that improvements are in no way limited to products, but can and will have to incorp orate changes in the way products are produced, packaged, transported, sold, used, reused, cascaded, recycled and disposed of... Use-sharing, renting, leasing and borrowing are just a few examples of concepts which result in reduced material flows . It also demands increasing the cost of capital (natural resour ces) in relation to labour us ing taxat ion. (75) Wherea s the first U.N.

From that amount they would then subtract out how much of the Earth's resources they use such as water, ener gy, food, mater ial, heat, etc.. If the net figure is a plus, the person is adding back to the Earth's resources. If it is a negat ive, he is taking awa y from the earth's resources and is therefore a bad g lobal citizen.

As described in chapt er 6, Prince Charles' Prince of Wales Business Leaders Forum (PWBLF) was set up in 1990 to promote Public-Private Partnership . The official website of PWBL F makes specific reference to key role of PPP market regulation in the New World Order: The Internatio nal Busines s Leaders Forum is an internat ional educational charity set up in 1990 to promote responsible busines s practices internation ally that benefit busines s and s ociety, and which help to achieve social, economic and e nvironme ntally sustainable development, particularly in new and e merging market economies .

A tax on carbon is now one of the major proposals of advocat es of global taxat ion (80) and the U.K. governmen t has already anno unced plans to impose satellite vehicle trackin g and road tolls (see chapt er 12). 7.6 WAR AS A MEANS OF PLANNED WASTE The blueprint for the economic destru ction of the U.S through war i s the policy pape r entit led Rebuilding America's Defenses written by the neo- conservative think-tank Proje ct for the New American Century in year 2000 . (81) It recogniz es the need to pursue an indeterminat e series of wars in order to protec t American interests. The U.S. Governm ent has also stated that the War on Terro r may nev er end. In 1984 George Orwell outlined the real Machiavel lian purpose of war: The primary aim of modem warfare... is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standa rd of living... The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour . War is a way of shatt ering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking into the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise b e used to make the masses too comfortable... The Report From Iron Mountain repeats Orwell's conclusio n: The production of weapons of mass destruction has always been associated with economic \"waste.\" The term is pejorative, since it implies a failure of function. But no human activity can properly be considered wasteful if it achieve s its contextual objective... In the case of military \"waste,\" there is indeed a larger social utility. In advan ced modern democratic societie s, the war system... has served as the last great safeguard against the elimination of necessary social classes... The continu ance of the war system must be assured, if for no other reason, among others, than to preserve whatever quality and d egree of poverty a society requires as an incent ive, as well as to maintain the stability of its intern al organizat ion of power. 7.7 CRIMINALIZING SOCIETY OVERALL ECONOMIC COSTS OF CRIME U.S. expenditure on prisons is currently $ 46 b illion a y ear. The overal l cost of crime in terms of lost productiv ity is in excess of $1 trillion per year. (82) Put another way, tota l loss of productiv ity due to crime is 10% of GDP (10.4 tri llion in 2002). Includ ing stole n assets the figure is $1.7 trillion. This has not come abou t by chanc e. Increasing the crime rate has been deliberate policy of the U.S. governmen t over the last two decad es and drug cr ime has been central to it.

Imprison ment is the single largest cause of lost productivi ty, accounting for 30% of the total. THE COCAINE IMPORT AGENCY (CIA) In March 1998, the CIA Insp ector General testif ied that there had e xisted a secret agre ement between the CIA and th e Justice Departm ent, wher ein \"dur ing the years 1982 to 1995, the CIA did not have to report the drug traff icking by i ts assets to the Justice Department.\" (84)( 85) As Michael Levine comment ed, \"..[to]a trained DEA agent this literally means that the CIA had been granted a license to obstru ct justice in our so-called war on drugs; a license that lasted, so the CIA claims, from 1982 to 199 5.\" That understanding rema ined in effect until August of 1995 , when Attorn ey Gener al Janet Reno rescinded the agreeme nt. The CIA collusion with allied drug traff ickers led to the formation of a prote cted narcotics pipeline, resulti ng an increas e in supp ly and d rop in price. Form er DEA agents have repeatedly pointed out that 50%-70% of the cocaine entering the U.S. went via drug car tels that enj oyed CIA prote ction. (86) Despite the exponential growth in spending on the alleged \"drug war\" , illicit drugs are cheaper and purer than they were two decad es ago, and continu e to be readily available. Between 1981 and 1998 , the price of hero in and cocain e dropped shar ply wh ile their levels of purity ros e. DRUG OFFENDERS ACCOUNT FOR THE EXPLODI NG PRISON POPULATION In 2001 the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Cr ime Reports (UCR ) estimated that there were 1,586,900 Stat e and l ocal arrests for drug abuse violations in the U.S. an i ncrease of 200% from the half million in arrest s 1982 when the War on Drugs began. T his acc ounted for 11.5% of all arrests. (87) The War on Drugs has resulted in the arrest, pros ecution and i ncarceration of tens of thousand s of persons each year for crimes associated with the sale, possession and use of illegal drugs. 500 ,000 drug offend ers are in prison, 25% of a two million prison popu lation. (88) In 1986 and 1988 C ongress enacte d mandat ory minimum senten cing laws, which force d judges to deliver fixed senten ces to individuals convicted of a crime, regardle ss of culpability or other mitigating facto rs. The most common mandatory sentences are for 5 and 10 years, and are based on the weight of the drug or the presence of a firearm . Simple poss ession of any quant ity of powder cocaine by fi rst-time offende rs is con sidered a misdemeano r, punishab le by n o more than one year in prison but simple pos session of crack cocaine results in a five-year mandatory sente nce. (89) The average sentence for a fi rst time, non- violent d rug offe nder is longer than the average sentence for rape, ch ild molestation, ban k robbe ry or mans laughter. (90) While the intent was to punish high-level drug offend ers, the laws have had the opposite effect-jailing low-level drug offende rs for unusua lly long sent ences. Enforc ement agencies focus their efforts on those minor actors in the trade who are the most easily arrested, prosecuted, and p enalized, rather than on the middle and hi gh-level crim inals who are drug d ealing's true maste rminds and prof iteers who are able to trade 66 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"information in return for significantly reduced prison sentences. Before the sentencing guideline conc ept took root, howev er, state lawmakers began enacting mandatory minimum pe nalties for drugs. This began in 1973 wi th the passage of the notorious \"Rockefeller drug l aws\" in New York (named after then Gov. Nelson Rockefeller) requ iring mandato ry 15-year prison sente nces for sales of small amo unts of narcot ics. (91) THE PRIS ON ECONOMY By increasing rates of crim e and i ncarce ration, the U.S. Govern ment has not only reduced living standards but has laid the foundat ions for the new coercion economy. The warn ing from past and presen t events is that pri vate corpor ations can meet a subst antial portion of their labour requ ireme nts through slave labour. There's nothin g wrong with putting prisoner s to work prov iding they are genu ine criminals and bas ic human r ights are uphe ld. Howev er, in both Nazi Germany and modern day Ch ina, slave labourers were not crim inals, they were enemies of the state or targets of genocide ; they were ruthlessly abused, tortured and murdered. Private corp orations were glad to use labour under these conditions. For this reaso n, the exponential growth of the U.S. pr ison popu lation accompanied by a d eterioration of civil liberties is caus e for seriou s concern. Also, when prison labour starts to become significant, as it now is in China, that has a negat ive effec t on wage and emp loyment levels. The num ber of inmates in state and fed eral prisons has increased more than six-fold from less than 200 ,000 i n 1970 to 1,440,655 by the end 2002. An additional 665,475 are held in local jails. As of 30 June 2002 , the nation's prison and ja il population exc eeded 2 mi llion for the first time in history. At the end of 2002 , 1 of every 143 Americans was incarcerate d, the highest incarceration rate in the world. The number of perso ns on probat ion and paro le has been growing dramat ically along wi th institutional popu lations. There are now 6.7 million Americans incarcerat ed or on probat ion or paro le, an i ncreas e of more than 265 percent since 1980. (92) In the U.K. the prison population was about 45,000 in 1990. By 2009 it could be as high as 107,000 acco rding to home office pred iction s. (93) The 1979 U .S. Fe deral Prison Industries Enhancement Certification Progr am gave private industry the green light to put st ate and federal pr ison inmates to work. Ma jor companies such as Texas Instruments, Honeyw ell, Hewlett-Packard, Siemen s, Micro soft and Bo eing sub- contract some low-end asse mbly work to prisons. They can pay the same or lower wag es as they would in Mexico but can use the 'made in USA' label. (94) (95) In July 2003 Del l Com puter Corp. was admon ished by an env ironmental group for running a pr imitive recy cling operation that expo sed prisoners to toxic chemica ls. (96) NAZI SLAVE LABOUR The use of slave labour by two major German i ndustr ial giants was scrutinized at the Nuremberg Trials. I.G. Farben had an e stimated 83,000 slaves at its Auschwitz factory and Krupp industr ies use around 75,000 s laves. Howeve r the full scale of slave labour was brought to light in 1999 when The American Jewish Comm ittee prese nted the results of their investigat ions. (97) Awar e of this investigation, major companies emp loyed their own historians to look for skeleton s in their closets. Deut sche Bank 's company historian discovered that it 67 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"helped finance the cons truction of Aus chwitz from which tens of thousand s of slaves were taken. (98) In Februar y 1999 thirteen major corp orations who used slave labour came clean and agreed to set up a compen sation fund for the victims to head off law suits: Allianz AG, BA SF AG, Bayer AG, BMW AG, Da imlerChrysler AG, Deut sche Bank AG, Degu ssa-Hüls AG, Dres dner Bank AG, Frie dr. Krupp AG, Hoes ch-Krupp, Hoech st AG, S iemens AG and Volkswag en AG. In December 1999 , The American Jewish Comm ittee produce d a list of 257 comp anies that used slave labour. Mo re than 50 companies on AJC's initial list of 257 f irms, i ncluding mu lti-nationals Shel l & DEA Oil GmbH, and For d Motor Co, joined the general comp ensat ion fund. Ten days after the list was issued, negotiators agre ed on a fund tota ling $5. 2 billion dollars. Pr ofessor Ulrich He rbert of, Un iversity of Freiburg , an expert on Nazi slave labour points out that the firms identified on the AJC list account for just a fraction of all German companies that used slave or forced labour. Indeed, virtually every industrial company of any size in German y used slave or force d labour. The total number of slaves is estimated at 12 m illion. German historians estimate that of the thousands of com panies that used forced and sl ave labour, more than 500 are still in operation. (99)( 100) The compensation fund i s now called The German Econ omy Foundation Initiative, whos e stated purpose is, ...guaranteeing that all German companies, including foreign affiliates and parent companie s, will be protected against lawsuits relating to the Nazi era and that they will be able to work on international markets under conditions of comprehensive and lasting legal security. (101) CHINA The Laoga i Research Foundation is a non- profit organization dedicat ed to collecting information about China's vast system of forced-labour camps. The foundatio n was started by Hongda Harry Wu , who has written three book s on his experienc es as a Chi nese prisoner for over 19 years. Current ly, there are estimated eight m illion prisoner s in China's slave labour camp system known as 'Laogai'. As a tool of political repression, the Laoga i serve s to silence all voices of political dissent throughout China. Once in the Laoga i, inmates are forced to confess their \"crime s,\" denou nce any anti-Party b eliefs and su bmit to a regime of reedu cation and l abour. Alt hough Chinese law forbids torture and the use of torture to extract confessions, the practice rema ins widespread in the Laoga i. Anyon e in China can be held for up to three years in with no trial or sente ncing procedure of any ki nd. All that is nece ssary is the directive of any offic ial in China's Public Secur ity Bure au. All prisoners in the Laogai are forced to labour. Labour condit ions vary from region to region and camp to camp. There are many report s of prisoners work ing up to 16 to 18 ho urs a day t o meet labour quotas that are enforc ed through withholding of food rations. P risoner s also often labour in highly unsafe conditions including work in mines and wi th toxic chemica ls. Some times conditions are less arduous with more reasonable worki ng hours and more humane treatme nt. Prisoners do not receive payment for their labour or any prof it generate d from the product s they produce. According to docu mented evidence gathere d by the Laoga i Research Foundation and other human rights and med ia organizations, the practice of harvesting the organs of executed prisoners in China began some time in the late 1970s. Organs harvest ed from 68 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"prisoners are used in transplant ope rations for privileged Chinese and for foreigners. According t o the statistics of Amnest y Internation al, China exec utes more prisoner s every year than the rest of the world combined. The deliberate application of forced labour by the Chinese government has spawned an entir ely new field in China's economy: the econ omics of slavery. One theorist clear ly defi ned this policy in the following stateme nt: The fundament al task of our Laogai facilities is punishing and reforming criminals. To define their function concretely, they fulfill tasks in the following three ways: (1) Punishing criminals and put ting them under surveillance; (2) Reforming criminals; (3) organiz ing criminals in labour and p roductio n, thus creating wealth for society. Our Laogai units are both facilities of dictator ship and special enterprises . - Criminal Reform Handbook, PRC Ministry of Justic e, Laogai Bureau,Shaan xi People's Publishers , 1988 (102) Western companies are still using slave labour today on a huge scale by trading with Ch ina. The U.S. imports approximate ly $70 b illion worth of Chinese goods. (103) The impor t of Chinese forced labour- made goods into the U.S. is illegal, according to section 1307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 , which make s it is illegal to import any pr oduct that i s produce d in whole or in part by p rison labour of any ki nd. In 1992, the need to directly confron t the Chinese regard ing this issue becam e apparent, leading to the signing of a docum ent known as the \"Memorandum of Understanding Betwe en the United States of America and the People' s Republic of China on Prohibiting Impor t and E xport Trade in Prison Labor Product s\". In the most recent State Departm ent Report on Human Rights from 1999 , U.S. authorities adm it that the MOU has been \"near ly impossible\" to enforc e and t hat Chinese author ities have been \"uncooperative . When a product is labeled \"Made in China,\" it may h ide the fact that i t was made in the Laogai by Chinese prisoners. Until China reveals the extent of their Laogai productio n, and U.S. companies are willing to release the location of all of their manufactu ring facilities in China, there is no way for the Western consumer to be certain that s/he is not financially contributing to the Laoga i syste m. Examp les include Chrysler's joint venture in China to make Cherok ees called Beijing Jeep Com pany and Volk swage n's joint ve nture in China to make the Santana model ca lled Shan ghai Volkswag en Autom obile Company. The Laoga i foundatio n investigat ion sho wed they were sourcing parts from prison labour. (104) The success of China's prison economy is evidenced by a ll the \"made in China\" toys in our shop s. The China National Toy Association (CNT A) is actua lly a front for People's Armed Police (PAP ) and t he Chinese Army (PLA) Laogai system. (105) 7.8 DISEA SE Spending on health care in the U.S. is projected to rise from 14% of GDP (2000) ($1.42 trillion ), to 17% in 2011 . (106) Total hea lth care expenditure in the E.U. averages 8% of GDP. (107) The pharmaceutica l companies are the major benefic iaries of disease as indicated by the ir market value.

What we are witnessing i s on the one hand i s a form of indenture through illness, a pharmaceutica l feuda lism. As diseas e increas es so does the tariff that society pays to the petro chemical sorc erers who provide symptomatic treat ments and abuse their power over medica l researc h to block any curative or preventative treatment s. However the other Orwellian economic goal of publ ic health policy is to make us poorer. Nothing i llustrates this second point better than the emerge nce of extrem ely disabling new diseases during the 1980s which are described in the final chapter of this book. The economic consequences of Western public health po licy are clear from the statistics of disability, unemplo yment and hea lthcare spending. The percentage of the popu lation who are disabled is similar in Europe and t he U.S.. In the E.U., disability is estimated to affect 10-20% of each country's popu lation and the U.K. and U .S. both have 15% disabled. (108)(109) So much for the medica l 'breakthroughs' of the twent ieth century. In the U.K. 3.8 million disabled people of working age are out of work , 11% of the total 34 m illion of work ing age. In the U.S., 13 m illion disabled people of work ing age are out of work 8.5% of the total 159 mi llion of work ing age. Incomes of house holds with at l east one disabled person are 20-30% lower than the income s of all house holds. For Federal Res erve Bank Chairman Pau l Volcker and Co. who requ ire a substantial decli ne in living standards in the West, these statistics repres ent succ ess not failure of the healthcar e system. CONCLUSION The dream of prosperity for all is dying out aroun d the world. Dev eloping countries which had an expand ing m iddle class in the early 1980s have been ransack ed. Almost 5 billion people on the planet do not have basic property rights enjoyed in the West. At the same time, Westerners are getti ng poorer year by year. In the U.K., the enormous increase in house prices has made home owners hip an i mpossibility for most young people. Chapter 7 End Not es 1. George Orwell, 1984, part 3 chapter 2.

Is there really a pl an for world governmen t of this nature or is this just conspiracy theor y? Vladimir Buk ovsky's classif ied Po litburo docum ents reveal that, in the years leading up t o the collapse of the Soviet Union, Gorbach ev was meeting w ith European socia list leaders and t he international financial elite, discussing the conv ergence of Soviet states with the new European state . Speaking i n private with Argentine President Carlos Menem on 25t h October 1990 , Gorbachev said: One of my aides has written sometime ago that we need to create a world government. People were laughing at him at that time. But now? C. Menem . Some 40 years ago, Peron was speaking of continent alism which would enable us to go for a world government. M. Gorbachev . I believe we should think about enhancing the UN role. It could not realise its potentia l for 40 years and only now did it get such an opportunity. Here is a proto-type of the world government for you. Mr Bukov sky's experience of socialism leads him to believe that t here is no limit to the expans ionist plans of the E.U.. Romano Prodi has already drawn up a map of the sphere of E.U. interests which includes the whole of the Middle East, North Africa and Tu rkey. The dreams of the financial elite and th e Socia list Internationa l are one and the same , because, as Bukovsky reflects, 'no utopia has ever worked in a limited sp ace, be it a village, a to wn, a con tinent or a planet'. Of cours e none of this co uld be done openly, which i s why the Russian s quickly sealed the Politburo arch ives again. It is being acc omplished using th e socia list tactic of incremental ism. The U.N., with its gent le light blue emb lem, is pre sented to the public as an institution of peace and socia l justice, serving as the sheep's clothing for the pack of wolves who sponsor it. Whilst the U.N. is still largely a fig leaf for one- world gove rnment, real political power blocs are being cons tructed on the basis of this cosy 'big idea'. Americans would be well advised to look at the E.U. to appreciate just how cosy this bi g idea isn't .The differences between the Anglo-American political tradition and the principles underp inning the 78 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"European Union were recently summ arized by Ashley Mote, Member of the European Parliament and au thor of Vigilance : A Defence of British Liberty. • Traditionally, in the U.K. and the U.S., the state draws its power from, and is answerable to the people. I n the E.U., the state exist s in its own right and the people answer to it. A significant e xample of this shift of philosophy can be seem in the anno uncement of a new mission statement for Britain's gigantic tax collection and we lfare agency, the Inland Revenue, proud ly displayed on the homepag e at www .inlandrevenue.gov.uk: The Inland Revenue is here to ensure that everyone understands and receives what they are entitled to and understands and pays what they owe, so that everyone contributes to the UK's needs.

What happens if one chooses not to 'contribute' to the U.K.'s need s and w ho defines how one should 'c ontribute'? • In the U.K. and U .S., our rights and fre edoms are our birth right. In the E.U., there are no rights or freedoms , only privileges that can be withdrawn. • In the U.K. and U .S., no man i s above the law. In the E.U., the bureaucrats have given thems elves immunity from pros ecution. • In the U.K. and U .S., the Governm ent can be rep laced by the people every few years. In the E.U., the governing C ommission is not elected by the people or the European Parliament, i t is appo inted by the heads of member states. • In the U.K. and U .S., everything is allowed unless specifically forbidden. I n the E.U. everything is implicitly forbidde n unless the E.U. decides to allow it. These principles are firmly embedded in the political organ ization of the European Union. Although there is not ionally a separation of powers between the Executive and Leg islature, in reality power is firmly in the hands of the Executive. The 25 Co mmissioners who cons titute the government of the E.U. are not Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) but are appointed every five years by a qua lified majority of the heads of each member state in the European Counci l. Although the Parliament has to appr ove the appo intment of the Comm ission, and i t can by two-thirds majority v ote to sack it, it canno t approve or reject the appo intment of individual Com mission ers or sack them individually. A 'motion of censure' has never achieved the nece ssary majority, and i f it ever did, the Parliament would not have the power to appo int a new Comm ission.

Mr Farage had asked fellow MEPs whether they would ‘buy a used car from this man’, when he revealed that M.

Britain has an eq ually impressiv e repres entative in the person of Peter Mandelso n, selecte d by Tony Blair and du ly app ointed in January 2005 as Comm issioner for Trade.

Commission has the exclusive right to draft l egislation mean ing that the Parliament cann ot initiate legislation or repeal i t. The Commission also has the right to 'its own power of decision ' as the 'guard ian of the Treaties' allowing it to issue its own Regulat ions as, f or examp le, to enforc e the Common Agricultural and Fisheries Policies. Un like Directives, Regulat ions immediately beco me law as soon as they have gone through the Europe an Parliament and do not ha ve to be ratified by the national parliaments of member states. Howev er, under the consultat ion proc edure there are major areas of E.U. legislation over which the Europe an Parliament has no power at all. The only legal requirement is that Parliament state s its opinion on propos ed legislation. The E.U.'s fact sheet entitled 'De cision Making i n the European Union' describes this in more depth. ( See http://europa.eu. int/institutions/decision- making/index_ en.htm) There are three main procedures for enacting new EU laws: • codecision; • consultation; • assent. The main difference between them is the way Parliament interact s with the Council [of Ministers]. Under the consultation procedure, P ar li am e nt m e r e l y g i v e s it s o p in io n [emphasis added]; under the codecision procedure, Parliament genuinely shares power with the Council. The European Commission, when proposing a new law, must choose which procedure to follow. The choice will, in principle, depend on the \"lega l basis\" of the proposal.... 80 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":".... The areas covered by the consultation procedure are: • Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters • Revision of the Treaties • Discr imination on grounds of sex, race or ethnic origin, religion or political conviction, disab ility, age or sexual orientat ion • EU citizenship • Agriculture • Visas, asylum, immigration and other policies associated with the free movement of persons • Transport (where it is likely to have a significant impac t on certain regions) • Competition rules • Tax arrangements • Economic policy • \"Enhanced co-operation\" - i.e. the arrangem ent allowing a group of member states to work together in a particular field even if the others do not wish to join in yet. Even where the Comm ission sends legislation t o both the Counci l of Ministers and the Parliament unde r 'codecision' procedure, the volume of Directives and Regulatio ns coming down from the Commission is so large that MEPs do not even have time to read m uch of the legislation. Because they often haven't got a clue what they are voting on, MEP s rely on civil servants to tell them how to vote. Current British MEP Nigel Farage stated that on one occasion , MEP s were required to vote on Directives 450 t imes in one 80-minute session. He freely admitted that it was a farce and he voted as he was told. 1 Again, in a BBC interview he said: For example, I'm told that on 21 July - the second day of this particular session - that I'm going to be asked to vote on up to 500 motions in a morning with my electr onic voting pad. It seems to me that that's just impossible . 2 The Lord's prayer contains 70 wor ds, the Ten Commandments 297, the American Declarat ion of Independence 300 and th e Common Mark et Directive on the export of duck eggs 26,911. Over 23,000 EU l egal acts are in force and around one third of British law now originates in Brus sels . 3 Finally, the European Parliament cannot even be called a t alking sho p. MEPs in the smal ler po litical groups are very lucky if they are given two 90 se cond slots a week to speak in a debate. Inform ed, in-depth discussion, theref ore, does not exist within the European Parliament . 4 In Britain, detailed transcripts are recorded of Parliamentary mat ters and publ ished for all to see (Han sard). In the E.U., few of the proceedings are general ly recorded or even made available for publ ic scrutiny . A search for the word 'minutes' on the useful E.U. dictionary www.EUABC.co m, revealed that, unlike other central banks,The Europe an Centra l Bank refus es to publish the minutes of its meetings. Th e dictionary also introduce s a new world 'comito logy' to describe the work and st udy of the many committees and wo rking groups in the E.U. A Swedish scientist has found approx imately 1350 act ive working groups in the Commission most of which operate without the full oversight of MEPs who cannot even get the lists of names of the participants. 81 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" The corruptio n in the Bruss els bureaucracy is discussed in more depth in chapter 11,'the legal apparatus of totalitarianism'. ELECTRONIC VOTING Recent events in the U.S. demon strate why ele ctronic voting is the modus operandi of the European Parliament and th e future of democracy under global feudal ism: its designed for fraud. Electronic touch screen voting is being rolled out acros s the U.S. using software that d oes not permit any physica l auditing or vote coun ting, perm its casting of multiple votes and can be remote ly acce ssed in order to chan ge the election result. How could the publ ic be persuad ed to accept this? Re member the 2000 electio n: After the debacle in Florida (and actua lly in plenty of other locations aroun d the U.S.), with its hang ing chads and pregnant chads and oth er punch-card problems, Congress pass ed the Help Ame rica Vote Act in 2002 . One of the funct ions of the new law was to prov ide $4 b illion for states to use in updating the ir often antiquated voting equ ipment. W ith fede ral money available, and the cautionary story of Florida as a wa rning, states began turning in drove s to electronic voting mach ines. This is the classical 'proble m- reaction- solution' tactics of the wolf in sheep's clothing. 5 The company at the centre of the contr oversy is Diebold E lection Syst ems Inc. of Ohio who have sold 33 ,000 t ouch screen voting mach ines in the United States. Diebold d onated at least $195,000 t o the Republi can Par ty between 2000 and 2002, and i ts CEO Wa lden O'Dell once pledge d to \"deliver\" Ohio's electoral votes for President Bush. 6 In Georgia dur ing the 2002 e lection s, som e voters using D iebold mach ines tried to vote for one cand idate, bu t the mach ine would instead register a vote for the oppone nt. There were six electo ral upset s in that election, in cluding one in which the incum bent senat or, who was far ahead in the polls, lost by 11 po ints. Diebold had ch anged the software used by the voting m achines seven or eight times, without anyone exam ining it, and then after the elect ion the comp any immediately overwro te the flash memory of all the cards used by those mach ines, so it is now impossib le to know what the vote counts really wer e. 7 Researchers at Johns Hopk ins University and R ice University said they had uncov ered bugs in a Die bold I nc. voting sy stem that could a llow voters and po ll workers to cast multiple ballots, switch others' votes, or shut down an e lection early. Encryption of sensit ive data is absent : Diebold doe sn't encrypt vote totals befor e they are transferre d to the Board of Elections over the Interne t allowing outsiders to reach into the system and ch ange election tallies. A lack of over sight in the developme nt proc ess could a llow progr ammers to create secret \"back doors\" for tampe ring as well. Diebold's sour ce code is kept secret. Vote rs do not get a paper receip t of their vote. 8,9,1 0 This information only cam e to public attention becau se in March 2003, some one hacked into a web- server used by Die bold and copied thou sands of messages post ed to an on line discussion board used internally by D iebold employee s to discuss its vot ing machi nes, as well as actu al code used in the voting mach ines. In August 2003, the docum ents were sent to journal ists and the story became mainstream. 11 Diebold r esponded by threatening legal action for copyright i nfringement demanding that the offending materi al be removed from internet sites. Computer programmers, ISPs and st udents at 20 universities, i ncluding the University of California at Ber keley and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, r eceived ceas e and decist letters. 82 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Unfortunately for Diebo ld, the files are now on servers all over the world .

UK The 1986 Public Order Act , made it a crim inal offence to active ly stir up r acial hatred. The definition of race includes national origins. EU E.U. laws against the nation state began with article 14 of the 1950 Europe an Conventi on for the Protec tion of Human Rights and Fundam ental Freedoms . The latest amendment to the convention, Protoc ol No 12, 4th November 2000 reads: A rticle 1 - General prohibition of discrimination · 1 The enjoyment of any right set forth by law shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status. · 2 No one shall be discriminated against by any public authority on any ground 83 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"such as those mentioned in paragraph 1 .17 [emphasis added] The law is now admi nistere d by the European Comm ission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) set up b y a Co uncil of Europe summit held in Vienna in Octob er 1993 .

The crimes include: public dissemination or distr ibution of tracts, picture s or other material containi ng expressions of racism and xenophobia; directing of a racist or xenophobic group (by \"group\" is meant a structured organization consisting of at least two persons established for a specific period).... 5. Instigating, aiding, abetting or attempting to commit the above offences will also be punishable.....10. Member States will take the necessary measures to imp lement this framework decision by 30 June 2004 . 24 THE AMERICAN UNION The Organization of American States was founded in 1948, and now includes all 35 independent countries of the Americas. Its purpose is the same as the E.U., a federal super- state, though politicians will never adm it to that. 25 Like the E.U. it is not a popu lar idea, a t least in the North ern hemisp here which has most to lose, therefo re opposit ion to it is being made illegal under the guise of protecting human ri ghts. Article 1 of The American Conventio n on Human Rights 1969 , reads: The States Parties to this Convention undertake to respect the rights and freedoms recognized herein and to ensure to all persons subject to their jurisdiction the free and full exercise of those rights and freedoms, without any discrimination for reasons of race,color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, economic status, birth, or any other social condition.26[empha sis added] The 1988 San Salvad or Protocol reads: The State Parties to this Protocol undertake to guarante e the exercise of the rights set forth herein without discrim ination of any kind for reasons related to race, color, sex, language, r eligion, political or other opinions, national or social 84 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"origin, economic status, birth or any other social conditi on.

The Model National Legislation for the Guidance of Govern ments in the Enactment of Further Legislati on Against Racial Discrimination actua lly chan ges the meaning of the word racism to include xenoph obia i n true Orwel lian Newsp eak.

In this Act, racial discrimination shall mean any distinction , exclusion, restriction, preference or omission based on race, colour, descent, nationality or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing, directly or indirectly, th e recognition, equal enjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms recognized in internat ional law.

It's worth interjecting at this point that t he E.U.'s cons titutional affairs committee have been chewing over a draft \"Statute of European Political Parties\". The establishment of state-funded pan- European parties is something that federal ists desp erately wa nt. If a majo rity of MEPs were to decide that a party was not abiding by t heir definition of human r ights and dem ocratic values, it would be debarred. This was precisely the ruse used across the Warsaw Pact. Parties were initially proscribed on grounds of being fascist, a nd, before long, this definition came to app ly to everyone except the communists and t heir Pe asant Party a llies. 29 NATIONAL BOR DERS WILL BE ABO LISHED 36. It is an offence for any official or other servant of the Stat e, or of a public establishment, national enterprise or a legal entity receiving finan cial assistance from the public autho rities, to deny an indi vidual or group of individuals access to a right, privilege or benefit on racial grounds. 37. It is an offence, on racial grounds: (a) To refuse to employ or refrain from employing an individual or group of individuals for a vacant post for which the persons concerned are qualified. According t o The Daily Telegraph , the first judicial ruling equating xenophobia with opposition to world gov ernment has already been made: Is Euro-sceptic dissent xenophobic? I ask the question only half in jest, because the EU institutions have a habit of outdoin g parody. The Advocate General of the European Court of Justice issued an opinion on October 19 - Case C-274/ 99 P - arguing that political criticism of the E.U. can be akin to blasphemy , and can therefore be restricted . He denies it. Read the case for yourself - in Spanish or French; English is not provided. He misuses a blasphem y case, Wingro ve v United Kingdom, as a building block in arguing for repressive powers to limit free speech. 30 The thou ght police are already act ive in Britain. In January 2003 , Robin Page , former pres enter of TV's One Man and his Dog and Daily Tele graph columnist, was questioned by p olice after saying co untry dwellers should enjoy the same rights as blacks, Muslims and h omosexuals. M r Page, was arrest ed on suspic ion of stirring up rac ial hatred after mak ing a spee ch at a p ro-hunting rally in Novembe r which be gan: \"If there is a black, vegetarian, Muslim, asylum-seeking, one-legged, lesbian lo rry driver present...I want the same rights as you.\" 31 8.3 CREATING REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS The political structur e of the U.N global governme nt will be built through regionalism, also known as federalism. Nation states will be brok en down into smaller region s and subsume d by larger internation al power blocs, just as the world was divided into Oceania, Euras ia and East asia in Orwe ll's 1984 , and i nto ten regions in Huxley's Brave New World . The E.U. super -state is almost complete and it is the model for the Organization of American State s.

Article 198 a of The Maas tricht Treaty 1992 32 set up The Comm ittee Of The Regions and since then, the U.K. governmen t has followed this agenda to break down the political structur e of the U.K. so the smaller pie ces can be made accou ntable to Brussels rather than We stminster.

Thes e predictions are widely shared by stude nts of the New World Order. National borders are ultimate ly defined by military compe tence. All of the U.N. edicts and conv entions mean nothin g unless they can be enforced militarily upon recalc itrant nations. The E.U. supe r-state will acquire its nec essary army through incrementalism, sometimes referre d to as the \"ratchet\" system since their is no mechanism for repeal ing E. U. laws. Howeve r the massive geo- political restruc turing need ed to get all nations unde r a wor ld army w ill require some thing quite spectacular. Think-tanks, un iversity gr ants and bri bes are not enough to bring about global governm ent. The league of Nations and t he United Nations were forged from the heat of the first and sec ond world wars. G lobal government will be the fall-out from World War III. There is a three pronged strategy being played out, masquerading as the Global War on Terror. Firstly, America' s super- power status will be destroy ed. This will partly be achie ved in carrying out the second tactic w hich i s to bring unco operative nations, espe cially those in the Middle East , under U.N. contro l. America' s military mi ght will be exhaust ed by invading Third World natio ns and setting up U. N. protectorates. Thirdly, threaten ed or actua l conflict between nuclear powers will persuade all nations to surrend er their military power to the U.N. there by permanently re linquishing their sov ereignty. Th is is why the West has given nuc lear technology to North Korea and C hina. At this point, before hundreds of cities are annihilated ,there will be an emergen cy U.N. confer ence. The agreem ent reached will be to surrend er control all weapons of mass destruct ion to a U.N. agency . The submiss ion of all conventional armed forces to U.N command will follow. Eventua lly all military forces will be U.N. 'Pea ce Keeping' forces, whos e purp ose is to enforc e the U.N. hegemony over rogue states. If this sounds a little fant astic, consid er this: NATO exer cises for enforcing U.N. embargoes on breakaway state s have already b egun. The first exercise of NATO'S Response Force took place between 11th and 26th Sept ember 2003 in Galloway , Sco tland. This was a 'cris is resp onse' operation called 'Exercise Northe rn Lights' in which the mission was enfor cing a U.N. arms embargo on a recently formed country . 36 87 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" A second exer cise took place in Turkey on 20th Nov ember 2003 . According to the NATO website, \"the forces rescued and ev acuat ed the U.N. staff and c ivilians, establ ished an embargo, engaged in count er-terrorist operations and a show of force\". 37 Like American and European politicians, the Russians and C hinese oligarchs are happy t o play the ir par t in this farce because they also dream of international governan ce. Former party bos ses are happy t o assume the new role of 'World Control lers' in the eastern regions of the Brave New World . The neo-conservative governmen t in the Whitehous e, like almost all prev ious administrat ions, is 100% committed to the globalist plan to destroy the independ ence of the U.S.. Once completed, the Donald Rumsfeld-initiated NATO Response Force will put the boot behind the imperial decr ees the Death Star wishes to impose on rebel colo nies. The policy of weakening the U.S. mi litary rea lly began i n earne st under Bush Sr. dur ing the first Gulf War. 300 ,000 of the 700,000 troop s deployed in Gulf War are now seriously i ll with Gulf War Illness. 38 They are being denied cheap and effective medical care for no apparent reason. Former Consultant to the Defense Departm ent, Dr Garth N icolson, estimates that at l east 25,000 have died sin ce the war ended. The others face permanent disability and destitut ion. Major Doug Rokke was the U.S. Army 's depleted uran ium proj ect director in 1994-95 who has since campaigned tirelessly to expos e the devastating hea lth effec ts of DU munitions. The report he has obtained from the U.S. Veter ans Administrat ion states that, by August 2004, it had awarded permanent disability com pensation to almost 280,000 U. S. troops who served in the Gulf region between August 1990 and May 2004 . 39 Meanwhi le, the Veterans Administration refus es to acknowledge that there is a G ulf War Illness, preferring to diagnos e post - traumat ic stres s disorder. 40 The cause of Gulf War Illness is multi-faceted, invariably linked to depleted uran ium mun itions, experimental vaccinat ions and exposure to chemica l and b iological weapon s. All of these facto rs lead back to the Western military-industr ial complex contr olled by the elite, whose ultimate goal is to destroy America militarily and ec onomically. The troops who served in the first Gulf War have almost all been cycle d out of the military, so the poor new recruits currently serving i n Iraq and Afghan istan know little or noth ing of their appal ling fate. The policy see ms to be to give troops a limited operation al lifespan, after which they are killed or incapac itated to make way for the next round of canno n fodder. Meanwhi le hundreds of billions of dollars are being bled from U.S. taxpayers to finance this destruction. As Georg e Orwe ll concluded in 1984 , War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking into the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable... In the next chapter, we'll find out who really benefits from the The War on Terro r, and co njecture who the terrorists really are. Chapter 8 End Not es 1.

The people give thanks to Big Brother for his prote ction and l ook back with nostalgi a on their love affair with civil rights. This is 'problem-reaction- solution' where the sponsors of an undesirab le measure pose it as a solutio n to another prob lem they secretly cre ated. This crude device was descr ibed by Orwe ll in 1984. The Party spon sored Emmanuel Goldstein's terrorist network, 'The Brothe rhood' and pretende d that Oceania was engaged in continua l wars against Eurasi a and Eastasia. The external threat justified the totalitarian syst em; anybody who oppo sed it was an enemy of the state. In the same way today, anybody who support s freedom and opposes war must be a member of Al-Qaeda. It is worth noting a few passag es in 1984 to compare with the current 'War on Terror'.

All subsequent crimes again st the Party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations, sprang directly out of his teaching...

Goldstein was often seen on the telescreen mouth ing h is speciou s claptrap: He was abusing Big Brother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party, he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocating freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought, he was crying hysterically that the revolution had b een betrayed Despite the daily arrest s of members of The Brotherhood, Goldstein himself was never caught : ... although Goldste in was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and a thousand time s a day, on platfor ms, on the telesc reen, in newspape rs, in books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were in spite of all this, his influence never seemed to grow less.... Somewhere or other he was still alive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea, under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps even -- so it was occasionally rumoured -- in some hiding-place in Oceania itself.

A Ministry o f Defen ce D-notice gagging order was issued to stop the press covering the trial of former MI5 agent David Shay ler who was char ged with break ing the Official Secrets Act. The gagg ing order came on the same day that the press reported that the government had pres sured the judge in Shayler's trial to acce pt public interest immunity (PII) certificates requiring the pres s and the public to leave the court if sensitive secu rity and i ntelligence issues were raised. By the evening of 7 th Octobe r, the D-notice had forced the London Guardian to erase an article wh ich or iginally stated : Government officials and law yers persuaded two cabin et ministers to sign the PII certificates after they learned that Mr Shayler intende d to defend himself at the trial. (6) However the Evening Standard s' article containing some of Shay ler's allegations still remains on its website: Shayler will be defending himself during the trial. He is expected to claim that British Secret Service agents paid up to £100,000 to Osama Bin Laden for an assassination attempt on Colonel Gadaffy in 1996 .

Mr Meacher detec ted a strong smel l of 'problem- reaction- solution' in the air: First, it is clear the US autho rities did little or nothing to pre-empt the events of 9/11. It is known that at least 11 countries provided advance warning to the US of the 9/11 attac ks. Two senior Mossad experts were sent to Washingto n in August 2001 to alert the CIA and FB I to a cell of 200 terrorists s aid to be preparing a big operation (Daily Telegraph, September 16 2001). The list they provided included the name s of four of the 9/11 hij ackers, none of whom was arrested. He, like many others, asked the question why when the first hijacking was suspe cted at 8 .20am not a single fighter plane was scrambled to investigate from the US Andr ews airforce base , just 10 m iles from Washi ngton DC, unt il after the third plane had hi t the Pent agon at 9. 38 am. There were standard FAA intercept proce dures for hijacked aircraft. Betwe en Septe mber 2000 and Ju ne 2001 the U.S. m ilitary launched fighter aircraft on 67 oc casions to chase suspic ious aircraft . It is a U.

This is why the elite have been proliferating we apons of mass destruction since the 1980s. The U.S. supporte d Saddam in the Iran/Iraq war b etween 1980 and1988 . Howev er, turning Saddam Hussein into a credib le threat to the West requ ired a helping hand f rom Uncle Sam . Donald Rumsfeld the U.S. Defen se Secretary met Saddam in 1983 to ease the way for U.S. companies to sell Baghdad biological and chemica l weapon s comp onents. (19) In 1994 , the Clinton adm inistrat ion initiated the 'Agre ed Framew ork' with North Korea, committing millions of dollars in aid for its nuc lear programme, allegedly for electric ity generation. In year 2000, Clinton authorized Donald Rumsfeld' s comp any ABB Inc. to build two lightwater nuclear r eactor s in North Korea. In January 2003, George Bush sought $3.5 million of taxpayers money for the same nuclear programme. (20) The U.S. Government claims that lightwater react ors cannot be used for nuclear weapon s production, even though the Congre ssional North Korea Advisory Group co ncluded in 1999 that, If the 1994 A greed Framework is implemented and two LWRs are eventually built and o perated in North Korea, the reactors could produce close to 500 kilograms o f plutonium in spent reactor fuel each year; enough for nearly 100 bombs annua lly if North Korea decides to break its obligations and reprocess the mate rial.( 21) Given that K im Jong- Il is a brutal dictator who has starved millions of his own people to death, t he U.S. Govern ment is building the best enemy money can buy. The result w ill be an es calation of the 'War on Terror'. In 1996 , President Clinton chan ged the law and a llowed advanced U.S. comput er technology to be sold t o foreign m ilitary users. The super- comp uters sold to China and Rus sia were designed for nuclear bomb development, advanced aircraft design , anti- submar ine warfar e sens or development, and radar applications. The se super- comp uters can run Am erican nuclear bomb design software and co des with little or no mo dification.

Interestingly, it occurred on the same day as terrorists bombed the British Embassy and H SBC bank i n Istanbul, killing 27 p eople. (23) In order to justify br inging in foreign troops to comb at domestic \"terrorism\", the U.S. Governme nt will send the Natio nal Guard abroad to fight. In 2003, 174,000 of the 350,000 res erves and nat ional guard were on active duty . (24) Since the 1991 Gulf War, the U.S. Governmen t has increased the number of National Guard and r eserves in foreign operations. During the Vietnam War, on ly 8,700 were deployed but ove r 75,000 Ar my and A ir Guardsmen were called upon to help bring a swi ft end to Desert Storm in 1991. Since that time, the Nationa l Guard has seen the nature of its Fed eral mi ssion change, with more frequent call ups in resp onse to crises in Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, and t he skies over Iraq.

Source: BBC documentar y, George Orwell: A Life In Pictures, 14 June 2003 Whethe r guns cause or prevent crime and need to be controlled for this reason is a con trover sial issue for many people. Howeve r, it is clear from history that c ivilian ownership of firearms is a m ajor deterant to tyrannica l government s. This is why the current move towards gun contr ol in the U.S., suppor ted by the U.N. campa ign aga inst small arms, should be viewed with grave suspicion. Unarmed or disarmed citizens are far m ore likely to be murdered by governmen ts than by common criminals or to die in wars. Gu n control laws are often imposed by gove rnments with murderous intent. Writing in The Arizona Journal of International & Comparative Law No. 3, 483-535 (2000) Stephe n Halbrook argues that German Jews and other German oppon ents of Hitler wer e not destined to be helpless and p assiv e victims. T he 1928 Weimar Law on Firearms and Am munition requ ired the registratio n of most lawfully owned firearms, as do the laws of some American states. The Weimar registration p rogramme prov ided the informat ion wh ich the Nazis need ed to disarm the Jews and ot hers consid ered untrustworthy. In Nove mber 1938 , the Nazis pass ed their own Weapo ns Law wh ich banned Jews from the firearms business and requ ired surrender of all firearms and edg ed weapons. In the same month came The Night of the Brok en Glass (Kristallnacht)- -the infamo us Nazi rampage against Germany's Jews. Aside from the Jews there was almost no resistance in Germany itself, because the Nazis had e njoyed years in which they could enforc e the gun l aws to ensur e that no potential opponent of the regime had the means to resist . Under the Weimar Law , the German police were granted complete discretion to deny license s to criminals or individuals the police deeme d untrustworthy. The Nazi disarmament campaign began as soon as Hitler assume d power in 1933 . Other Europe an countries also had l aws requ iring police records to be kept on persons who possessed firearms. When the Nazis took over Czech oslovak ia and Po land i n 1939, it was a simple matter to identify gun owners. Many of them disappeared in the middle of the night along w ith po litical oppon ents. The invasio n of Belg ium, Holland and Fr ance in May 1940 was accompanied by a la w called Regulatio ns on Arms Possession in the Occupie d Zone which or dered the surrend er of all firearms and munitions on pa in of death. Switzerland was the only cou ntry in Europe, indeed in the world, wher e every man had a m ilitary rifle in his home. Nazi invasion p lans acknowledged the dissuasi ve nature of this armed popu lace. (26) In a rev iew by Dav id B. Kopel of the book entit led Lethal Laws, published by Jews for the Pres ervation of Firearms, Kopel gives a stark warn ing to advocat es of gun contr ol. All of the major tyrannical regimes of the twent ieth cent ury imposed restrict ive gun l aws on the populations befor e they murdered and terrorized them en masse . The countries examined were Ottoman Turkey, USSR, Nazi Germany , China, Guatema la, Uganda , and Cam bodia. The same thing happened in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia at the time the book was written. R.J. Rummel , the world's forem ost scholar of the mass murders of the 20th century and fi nalist for 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, gi ves statist ical dimension to state spon sored murder. Statisti cs of Democide ,1997 , and Death by Govern ment, 1994 , provide data on mass murd er by governments throughout the 20th century. In chapt er 2 of Death by Govern ment he defines the murder of civilians and POW' s by g overnments - in contra st to sold iers dying in combat and 104 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"civilians who are killed unintentionally during war - as \" demo cide \": Democide's necessary and sufficient meaning is that of the intentional government killing of an unarmed or disarmed person or people . [empha sis added] (27) What is the track record of governme nts of undemo cratic coun tries murder ing unarmed citizens? According to table 1.6 in Death By Government, the average estimate of the total numb er of victims of governme nt spon sored mass murder over the twentieth cent ury was 169,202, 000. If the military and civilian deaths caused by war for the whole twentie th century are added, the death total only rises to an e stimated 203,000,000. (28) The more alarming fact about Rummel's statist ics is that the ratio of governmen ts murdering their own citizens to foreign citizens is approx imate ly 3 to 1. Rummel says that o f the 169,202,000 de mocide deaths, 129, 908,000 were domestic killings. The biggest murde r of citizens by their own governme nts took place in Russia and C hina unde r Stalin and Ma o. The Nazis killed mostly foreigners (estimate 20 mi llion) and o nly abou t a mi llion of their own. Acc ording to Rumme l, the People's Republic of China killed a stat istically insignificant number of foreigners but a medi an estimate of 35 m illion of their own between 1945 and 1987 . The USSR killed abou t 54 m illion of their own but only 7 mi llion foreigners 1917 -1987. (29) Equally important to our current predicament is Rummell's obser vation in Power Kills that de mocide is highly and inversely related to democracy and that demo cracies never make war on each other : There is one solution to each and the solution in each case is the same. It is to foster democratic freedom and to democratize coercive power and f orce. That is, mass killing and mass murder carried out by government is a result of indiscriminate, ir responsible power at the center. Or in terms of the title of this book, power kills. (30) The most power ful person and the driving force behind the New World Orde r in the U.S. for the last few decad es has been Davi d Rockefeller. In an a rticle in the New York Times , 10 August 1973 , he was quoted: Whatever the price o f the Chinese Revolution, it has obvious ly succeeded not only in producing more efficient and d edicated admin istration, but also in fostering high morale and community of purpose. The social experiment in China under Chairman Mao's leader ship is one of the most import ant and s uccessful in human history. David Rock efeller st ill heads the CFR and B ilderberg group which are work ing to relinquish Ame rican nationa l sovereignty to the United Nation s. Stephen Rockefeller works with ex- KGB chief Mikhae l Gorbache v to form ulate and promote the radica l U.N. env ironme ntal laws.

A ll of the victims were told that they were being temporari ly relocat ed or anot her lie in order to induce them not to resist.

Since 9/11, there has been a global attack on civil liberties and a race to set up the international technological infrastructur e for a high-tech feuda l society. G overnments acros s the world are promoting the idea that so ciety must militarize itself in order to be free from terror, i.e. abandon mora l conviction s, sweep aside distinction s betwe en foreign and dome stic threats, and e ven the distinction betwe en terrorism and ord inary crime. Wh en a country is at war , their is no atrocity it will not justify in the name of victory . Once the legal and technologica l apparatus of totalitarianism is established, there exists the very real prosp ect of a pe rmanent planetary dictatorship where human existence is micro-managed from cloud cuck oo land by a t iny ru ling elite who are themselve s above the law. 11.1 INTE GRATI ON The European globalists seized upon the Madrid tra in bom bing of 11 March 2004 to push forward key areas of E.U. judicial and se curity integrat ion.

The draft M ental h ealth Bill published in June 2002, included plans to force menta lly ill people living in the community to take their medication and p roposals to detain dangerou s people with severe personality disorders even if they have not committed a crime. (3) 'Seriousp ersonality disorder' has no medica l diagnosis. The Joint House of Common s and Ho use of Lords Committee on Human Rights have serious reservations about some aspe cts of the draft:1)The compulsory detention of people for the protection of other s when the people deta ined have never been char ged with any criminal offence; 2) the breadth of circumstanc es in which a pat ient could be subjected to compulsory, non cons ensual treatment ; 3) that pa rt of current laws wh ich prevent s detention 'by reas on of promiscuity or other immoral conduc t, sexual deviancy or depende nce on drugs or alcohol' has been omitted from the Bill. The committee warn ed that Nazi Germany and t he U.S.S.R. were probab ly not the only countries in which so cially or politically unacceptable behav iour was regarded as a manifestation of a 'disorder of the mind'. (4) In the U.S., Miss ouri dent ist Char les Sell has waited in a federal prison for more than four years for trial on charges of Medicaid fraud . The delay is attributed to the Governm ent's persistent argument that Sel l is not mentally comp etent to stand trial unless he is forcibly drugged. He is, they say, suffering from delusions becau se he thought there was a Governme nt effort to cove r up his personal know ledge of the its culpability in the 1993 de aths at the Branch Davidian land near Waco, Texas. The state has diagnosed Sell as having what i t calls a 'delusional disorder '. As an Ar my Reservist called up to serve as an expert in forensic dentist ry, Dr. Sell was on the scene the day of the tragic fire. Other issues include accusa tions of Dr. Sel l using po litically incorre ct swear words. The Governm ent want s to make him com petent by forcefully giving him powerful medicine. Dr. Sell doesn't want to be medicated since he's had bad r eactions to similar drugs in the past. A lso, one of the medicines that the Governm ent might want to use on him is an experimenta l med icine that could kill him.

(8) 11.3 ABOLITI ON OF JURIES AND ARBIT RARY DETENTIO N UK The 2003 Criminal Justice Act contains three areas of serious conc ern: 1) Removal o f the right to trial by jury in complex fraud case s or wher e the judge and pros ecution believe their is a risk of jury tamper ing 2) abolishing the double jeopardy mak es all acqu ittals conditional; 3) the admissibility of prev ious convict ions, acqu ittals and h earsay evidence. (9)(1 0) This is moving British justice towards a Europe an style inquisitorial system, away from the traditional adversaria l system. These measures are designed to harmon ize the U.K. with the E.U. Corpus Juris proposal put forward in April 1997. CJ will set up a European Public Prosecutor on the continenta l inquisitorial model , who will have over -riding jurisdiction t hrougho ut Europe to instruct national judges to issu e arrest warrants against suspe cts and have them held in custo dy for nine months pending investigati on (or transpor ted to other countries in Europe) with no obligation to produc e pros ecution evidence and no right to a publ ic hear ing duri ng this time. The case s are then to be tried by special courts, consisting of profes sional j udges and exclud ing simple juror s and la y mag istrates. The E.U. public prosecutor is responsib le for both investigat ion and pros ecution of the crimes. Our r ights of habeas corpus establ ished in 1679 and trial by jury established by Magna Carta in 1215 are to be nullified. Furthermore, the European Arrest Warrant removes the need for any f ormal extradition proc edure s for 32 cr imes, some of which are not even crimes in U.K. la w. These include xenopho bia and rac ism which encompas s criticism of the E.U.. The Corpus Juris manua l itself, (Sous la direction de Mireille Delmas- Marty, ISBN 2-7178- 3344- 7, p40 , para 3), i nforms us that: \"[Corpus Juris is] designed to ensur e, in a largely unified European legal area, a fairer, simpler and m ore efficient syst em of repres sion.\" (11)( 12)(13)(14)(15) Under the Anti-Terrori sm, Crime and Security Act 2001 , the Home Secretary could order that a for eign nat ional be deta ined indefinitely on suspic ion that he was either a terrorist or a threat to nat ional secur ity. Howev er, in December 2004 , the law lords ruled that thes e powers contravened the European Convention on Human R ights and ordered the release of twelv e foreign na tiona ls who could otherwise have been deta ined in prison indefinitely. In response, the Governm ent introduc ed the Prevention of Terrorism Bill , which gives the Home Secretary power to impose 'control orders ' on both British and f oreign terror suspe cts. Instead of holding susp ects in prison, the control orde rs could: Impose house arrest or other restriction s on moveme nts, including electronic tagg ing; restrict association and com munication with specif ied people; restrict use of telephon es and t he internet. This overturns 800 years of British le gal history by taking away bot h habeus corpus and tri al by jury, and g iving judicial power s to the Home Secr etary! Unsurprisingly it faces a stormy passag e through both House s of Parliament.

This ostensibly brings the U.S. into line with proc edure s betwee n European coun tries. Parliament was not consulted at al l and the text was not available unt il the end of May . Like the European Arrest Warrant, i t removes the requirement on the U.S. to provide prima facie evidence when requesting the extrad ition of people from the U.K., although that requ irement rema ins when the U.K. makes the request of the U.S.. (17) USA Section 412 of the U.S.A. Patriot Act allows for the indefinite detentio n of non- citizens. The Attorne y General has unprecedented new power to order their detention based on a certification t hat he has reasonable grounds to believe a non-citizen endangers national security . Wor se still, if no other country will accep t them, they can be deta ined indefinitely in the U.S. without trial. In January 2003 , a decis ion by the 4th U .S. Ci rcuit Court of Appe als in Richmond, Va. on the case of Yaser Esam Hamd i, affirmed the Government 's authority to detain indefinitely Ame rican citizens captu red in foreign battles or those who participate in terrorist attacks against U.S. interes ts abroad. (18) The court did not addres s questio ns about U.S. citizens arrested as enemy combatant s in the U.S. Furthermo re, in June 2003, a U .S Federal Court ruled that the Governme nt can keep secret the names of the hundreds of foreigners deta ined since 9/11. (19) The Governm ent has classif ied as an 'enemy combatant', Jose Padilla of Chicago, who was arrest ed at O'Hare Airport on suspic ion of plotting domes tic terrorism after return ing from Pakistan. This unco nstitution al detention still awaits judicial review (20) Judic ial Review of Padilla's case will be void if Ashcr oft's ' Patriot Act II' is passe d because it gives him power to designate U.S. citizens 'enemy combatants' for terrorist activity car ried out in the U.S.. Section 501 (Expatriation of Terro rists) expands the 'enemy combatant ' definition to all American citizens who 'may' have violated any prov ision of section 802 of the first Patrio t Act. Section 101 w ill also designat e individual American terrorists as 'foreig n power s' and again strip them of all rights under the 'enemy combatant ' desig nation. Under section 802 of Patriot Act I, the term `dome stic terrorism' means activities that, `(A) involve acts dangerous to hum an life that ar e a violation of the crim inal laws of the United States or of any State ; `(B) appear to be intended, `(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian popu lation; `(ii) to influence the policy of a governmen t by intimidation or coercion; or `(iii) to affect the conduct of a governmen t by mass destru ction, assas sination, or kidnapping; and `( C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. (21) Not only has the Justice Department stated they can infer from condu ct that some one is not a U.S. citizen but a lso under section 201 of ' Patriot Act II' , it is a crim inal act for any member of the Governmen t or any c itizen to release any i nformation concerning th e incarceration or whereabouts of detainees.

A draft of the bill was leaked to Washingt on D.C. wa tchdog, The Center For Public Integrity, in January 2003 . It caused such a furore that the bill was immediately shelved. Howev er there are three ways the Governm ent might use to get it pass ed: 1) After the next majo r terror attack, it will be rushed into law by pan icked legislators in the same way Patriot Act I was pass ed in the immediate after math of 9/11; 2) the Governmen t will declare martial law and impose the legislation without author ity from Congres s; 3) the bill will be broke n down into pieces and tacke d onto other legislation. On 12 June 2003 the The Guard ian newspap er reporte d that U.S. military officials are making preparat ions for the trial and pos sible exec ution of captiv es held in Guan tanamo Bay, including the cons truction of a death chamber. A building at the detention camp in Cuba for susp ected Al-Qaida me mbers is being renovate d to serve as a cou rtroom for military tribunals, signaling that t he U.S. is moving towards bringing char ges against some of the prisoners. (24) According to The Mail on Sunday: American law professor Jonathan Turley, who has led U.S. civil rights group protests agains t the military tribuna ls planned to hear cases at Guantanamo Bay, said: \"It is not surprising the authorities are building a death row because they have said they plan to try capital cases before these tribunals. \"This camp w as created to execute people . The administration has no inter est in long- term prison sentences for people it regards as hard-core terrorists.\" (25) In June 2004, The Washington Post published on its web site an in terna l White House memo from 1st August 2002, signed by then Assistant Attorn ey General Jay S. Bybee , which argued darkly that tortur ing al-Qaida capt ives \"may be justif ied\" and t hat international laws aga inst torture may be uncon stitut ional if applied to interrogations\" conducted under President Bush. The memo then continued for 50 pages to make the case for the use of torture. The Bybee memo was clearly the basis for the work ing-group report on deta inee interrogat ions presented to Defense Secretary Donald H . Rumsfeld a year later.

The notion that torture is acc eptable is also being heav ily prom oted in the mainstream American med ia. 11.4 EXPA NDING THE DEFIN ITION OF 'TER RORISM' The purpose of creating cr imes of 'domestic terrorism', is to abolish civil rights and to dramat ically increas e the power of government. This th is was forseen in a report published by the U.S. Army War College in July 19 94, ent itled Revolution in Military Affairs and Conflicts Short of War: American leader s popularized a new, more inclusive concept of national security. No distinction--legal or otherwise--w as drawn between internal and external threats. In the interd ependent 21st century world, such a differentiation was dangerously 113 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"nostalgic. The new concept of security also included ecological, public health, electronic, psychological, and economic threats. Illegal immigrant s carrying resistant strains of diseas e were considered every bit as dangerous as enemy soldiers . Actions which damag ed the global ecology, even if they occurred outside the nominal borders of the United States, were seen as security threats which should be stopped by force if necessary. Comput er hackers were enemies. (29) THE UK DEFINITION: The U.K. 2000 Terrorism Act expands the definition of terrorism to include serious damage to property or compute r systems, designed to intimidate a section of the public, and wh ich is carried out for political, religious or ideological reason s. This could i nclude animal rights activism, tree protes ters and even some kinds of industrial actio n. The Home Secr etary is afforded powers to designate and pros cribe 'terrorist' organ izatio ns. This is a very significant power because of the severe pena lties imposed for anyone involved or asso ciated with these groups. Amnest y Internation al have pointed out the potentia l for repre ssive foreign governme nts to press for their political enem ies to be so designat ed. Membership of a proscribed organ izatio n carr ies a ten year prison senten ce. Organ izing or addres sing a meeting which in cludes member s of a pros cribed group is an offen ce under section 12. This even criminalizes independent third parties such as journal ists who arrange private mee tings which include a memb er of proscr ibed group. Se ction 56 cr iminalizes any l evel of activ ity within a prosc ribed group even if it has noth ing to do with terrorism. It carries a maximum sent ence of life imprisonme nt. Section 57 imposes ten years imprisonment for poss essing some thing wh ich could be construe d as being intended for use in terrorist activ ities. Section 44 of the Terrorism Act allows police limited power to stop and search people for articles 'of a kind which could b e used in connection with terrorism'. The impor tant issu es are that the police do not have to demonstrate any grounds for reasonable suspic ion wherea s The Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) allows a cons table stop and search author ity if they are acting on reasonabl e grounds . Secondly if the cons table does find the items in question, and if there is reas onable suspic ion that they will be used for terrorist purposes, they may be seized and re tained. (30) Section 44 notices have been used by police to stop and sear ch protes ters at RAF Fairford during the Iraq war and mo re recently aga inst prote sters at an i nternationa l arms fair in London. (31) THE EU DEFINITION Article 1 of the Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism December 2001 reads: [ offences] which are intent ionally committed by an individual or a group against one or more countries, their institutions or people with the aim of intimidating them and seriously altering or destroying the political, economic or social structures of those countries will be punishable as terrorist offences . Article 4 extends the definition to include 'instigating, aiding, abetti ng or attempt ing to commit a terrorist offence' and Ar ticle 5m ., 'Promoting of, supporting of or participation in a terrorist group.' Explanatory notes state that 114 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Article 3., defining ter rorist offen ces 'could include, for instance, urban violence '. The inclusion in Article 3f. of the 'unlawfu l seizu re of or damage to stat e or governmen t facilities, means of public transport, infrastructure facilities, places of public use, and p roperty' (prop erty cove rs publ ic and pr ivate) could embrace a wide range of demonst ration and p rotests, rang ing from the non-violent Greenham Common protests against a U.S. cru ise missile base in the U.K., to the anti-globalization pr otests in Genoa. The phrase in Article 3h .,'endang ering people, property, animals or the envir onment', could refer, for example, to animal right prote sts. (32) Under Article 5. the prison sent ences imposed are long: 5l., Directing a terrorist group 15 ye ars; and 5m ., promoting of, supporting of or participation in a terrorist group, 7 years. Terrorists will also lose their right to vote. The E.U. anti-terrorism laws are being directed against prote sters at E.U. summ its and other internat ional conferences. Following the arrest and sho oting of protes ters at the E.U. summit in Gothenberg 14-16 June 2001, a Pol ice Coope ration Work ing Party met in Brus sels on 4 July . This was quickly followed by a series of meetings by the E.U. Council's Justice and Home Affairs committee who request ed that member states participate in i) surveil lance of protest groups ii) the plan to create a new database on the Sche ngen Information Syste m (SIS) on prote stors; iii) the plan agreed to bring together para- military po lice units (eg: carabiner i, CRS, Tactica l Support Groups for EU Summ its and i nternation al meetings. (33) THE AMERICAN DEFI NITION Under section 802. of the Patriot Act , the term 'domestic terrorism' means activities that, `(A) involve acts dange rous to human l ife that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any St ate; `(B) appear to be intended,`(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian popu lation; `(ii) to influence the policy of a gov ernme nt by in timidation or coercion; or `(iii) to affect the condu ct of a governme nt by mass destru ction, assa ssination, or kidnapp ing; and '(C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.' Also under section 802, the U.S. Government can bank rupt p olitical organ izations it asserts are involved in domestic terrorism. The government can seize and/or freeze the assets on the mere asse rtion that there is probable cause to believe that the assets were involved in domestic terrorism. The assets are seized before a pe rson is given a hear ing, and oft en without notice. In order to permanently forfeit the asse ts, the Governm ent must go befor e a court, but at a civil hear ing, and it is only requ ired to prove that the asset s were involved in terrorism by a preponde rance of the evidence. Section 806 i s so broadly def ined that i t could in clude anyone who supp orted a terrorist group in any wa y. (34) Section 301- 306 of ' Patriot Act II' (Terrorist Identification Databas e) authoriz es a nat ional database of suspected terrorists and rad ically expands the database to include anyone associated with suspe cted terrorist groups and anyone involved in crimes or having suppor ted any group designated as terrorist . These sections also set up a natio nal DNA database for anyone on probat ion or who has been on probatio n for any cr ime, and orders State governmen ts to collect the DNA for the Federal government. (28) Section 402 is titled \"Prov iding Material Support to Terror ism.\" T he section reads that t here is no requ irement to show that t he individual even had the intent to aid terrorists.

It will track not only suspe cted foreign terrorists but also Americans tied to domestic event s like violence at abortio n clinics. (39) 11.5 SURVEILLANCE LAWS UK The 2001 Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Secu rity Act enables the police and security se rvices to go through personal information he ld by 'pub lic authorities', e.g. medical records, bank stateme nts, school reco rds, Inland Revenu e files, even though no crim e (let alone terrorist offenc e) has been committed or even suspe cted. No judicial oversight i s required and indeed the informat ion can be volunteered by the public bod ies on a spontane ous basis . (40) 'Public auth ority ' is defined by the 1998 Human Ri ghts Act (6)(3) as (a) a court or tribunal, and (b ) any pers on whose funct ions are of a public nature. (41) Section 19 of the 2000 Terrorism Act makes it a criminal offenc e punishable by up to five years in prison, not to disclose to the police information that creat es suspic ion of terrorist activ ity when discove red in the cour se of one's ' trade, profe ssion, business or emp loyment'. (42) On 24 Nov ember 2004, the Governme nt introduce d the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill, which se ts up a an FB I-style Se rious Organi zed Cr imes Agenc y (SOCA). This Bill is still being d ebated, but the Fourth Report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights raises serious conc erns over surveil lance power s granted to the Agency. It confe rs broad power s to SOCA to gather, store and analyse information relating to crime general ly not just serious crim e. It also 116 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"confers broad power s over the kinds of information SOC A gathers, and the disclosure of that i nformat ion both to the Agency, and by the Agenc y to other Governm ent departme nts. These laws reflects a shift in philosophy towards the E.U. Corpus Juris mode l, in which on e is presume d guilty until proven innocent and theref ore dese rving of continuous surveillance. (43) USA Section 358 of the Patriot Act requires that, in addition to law enfor cement, intelligence agencies such as the CIA also receive suspic ious activity reports from financial institutions. The se reports are usua lly about wholly domestic transactions of people in the United States, and do not relate to foreign intelligence information . In addition, Section 358 a llows law enforc ement and intelligence agencies to get easy access to individual credit reports in secret. There is to be no jud icial review and n o not ice to the pers on to whom the records relate. (44) Section 215 allows the FBI to force anyone at all - including docto rs, libraries, books tores, universities, and i nternet service provid ers - to turn ov er records on their clients or custom ers. The FBI does not even have to show a reasonable suspic ion to a judge that the recor ds are related to crim inal activ ity, much less the requ irement for 'probable cause ' that is listed in the Fourth Amendm ent to the Constitut ion. Judic ial oversight of these new power s is essentially non- existent. All the Government needs to do is make the broad assertion that the reque st is related to an on going terrorism or foreign i ntelligence investigat ion. A person or organization forced to turn over record s is proh ibited from disclosing the searc h to anyone. As a result of this gag ord er, the subjects of survei llance never even find out that t heir personal record s have been exam ined by the governmen t. Sect ion 213 ex pands the Government's ability to search private property with a warrant but wi thout notice to the owner. This means that la w enforc ement agents can enter a hous e, apartme nt or office with a se arch warrant when the occu pants are away , sear ch through the ir prope rty, take photograph s, down load files off their comp uter and i n some case s even seize property and not tell them until later. The Patriot Act also change s the law to allow wiretaps and searches without showing p robable cause when 'a significant purpos e' is intelligence gather ing for regu lar dome stic crim inal case s. It also expands the use of warrant less wiretaps to include lists of websites visited and ema il heade rs. (45) Section 106 of ' Patriot Act II' states that Governm ent agents must be given immunity for carrying out warran tless searches of private property. This section throws out the entire Fourth Amendm ent against unreasonable searches and seizures. Section 123 restates that the Government no longer needs warrants and that the investigat ions can be a giant dragnet-style sweep. Section 126 grants the Government the right to mine the entire spec trum of pub lic and private sector informat ion from bank r ecords to educationa l and med ical records. This is the enacting l aw to allow comput ers to break down all walls of privacy. The Government states that they must look at everything to 'determine' if individuals or groups might have a conne ction to terrorist groups. From cradle to grave, a ll Americans will be guilty and nev er proven innocent . Sect ion 301- 306 sets up nat ional database s of suspe cted terrorists complete with DNA sample s. The datab ase will also be used to 'stop other unlawful activ ities'. It will share the information wi th state, lo cal and foreign agencies for the same purposes.

(47) It achieved one of the obje ctives of ' Patriot Act II' by removing the need of the FBI to obta in a wa rrant before condu cting sear ches of third party in formation. Congr essman Ron Paul made a speech against the bill in November: I am referring to the stealth addition of language drastically expanding FBI power s to secretly and without court order snoop into the business and financial transactions of American citize ns. These expanded internal police powers will enable the FBI to demand transaction reco rds from businesses, including auto dealers, travel agents, pawnbrokers and more, without the approval or knowl edge of a judge or grand jury. This was written into the bill at the 11th hour over the obje ctions of members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which would normally have jurisdiction over the FBI. The Judiciary Committee was froze n out of the proce ss. It appears we are witnessing a stealth enactment of the enorm ously unpopular \"Patriot II\" legislation that was first leaked sever al months ago. Perhaps the national outcry when a draft of the Patriot II ac t was leaked has led its supporters to enact it one piece at a time in secret. Whatever the case, this is outrageous and unacceptable.

Sec tion 205 allows top Feder al off icials to keep all their financial dealings secret, and anyone investigat ing them can be conside red a terrorist.

Thus no buildings or offices, filing cabinets, arch ives or bottom drawers belong ing to the E.U., where ver they are located, can be snoo ped, searched or inspect ed EVER. These two exemptions alone place the staff and premises of the E.U., in their official capacit ies, completely above the law.

These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities. – Between Two Ages- America's Role in the Technetronic Era, 1970. Zbigniew Brzezinski,first director of The Trilateral Commissio n 1973-1976 and U.S. Nationa l Security Advisor 1977-1981 . Source:The Rand Corporation website In an interv iew w ith The Times newspaper , the U.K. Information Comm issioner, Richard Thoma s, expressed his con cern that \"we don't sleepwalk into a su rveillance society\". (1) He said that there is a grow ing danger of East German Stasi-style snoo ping if the state gathers too much information abou t individual citizens. He was referring to three projects in particular, which Brzezinski foresaw over thirty years ago: the proposed Identity Card sche me which w ill have personal deta ils and t he fingerprints of everyone in the country ; the popu lation dat abase named the 'Citizen’s Information Project' and p roposals in the Children B ill - currently before Parliament - which would create a database of pers onal informat ion on all children from birth to age 18 and deta ils of their parents. These and man y other measure s and technologies are being introduc ed piecemeal acro ss the globe and justifie d individually. Howev er collectively, they constitute the awesome global network of big brother surveillance planned decad es ago. 12.1 ID CARDS AND BIOMETRIC IDENTIFICATION EURO PE After the establishment of biometric ID syste ms, pressure will begin to build to enact laws that wi ll requ ire citizens to produc e an ID whenev er a government 124 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"official demands it. In the coun tries that already hav e national ID card system s, the police have acqu ired such power s e.g. Franc e, Germany, Belg ium, Greece, Luxembourg, Portuga l, and Sp ain. (2) The European Comm ission has produced two draft Regulat ions (25.9.03) to introduce two sets of biometric data (f ingerprints and fac ial image) on visas and resident permits for third country nationals by 2005 . The biometr ic data and personal d etails on visas will be stored on national and E. U.-wide databases and be acce ssible th rough the Visa Information System (VIS) held on the Schengen Information System (SIS II). The Regulation st ipulates that two biometr ic identifiers must be held on an imbed ded chip in a docum ent. (3) On 13 December 2004, the E.U. General Affairs Counci l agreed to adopt a Regulatio n on mandatory facial images and f ingerpr ints in E.U. passp orts. (4) Once the deta ils have been decided, re placem ent and new passp orts will have to contain faci al images within 18 m onths and f ingerprints within three years. The U.K. has not signed up to this Regulation, but is proceeding with biometric passpo rts and ID cards anyway. UK The Governme nt introduced The Ident ity Cards Bill in Novemb er 2004, enabling the phased introduction of ID cards by 2008. (5) The Home Office website partly justifies the ID card on the grounds of internat ional requirements, stating that Br its will not be able to trave l abroad if we don't have biometric passports and that we might as well have an ID card because the biometr ic passp ort syste m is virtually the same thing!: The Government's decision to proceed with the introduction of a national identity cards scheme is based in part on the fact that we will have to introdu ce more secure personal ident ifiers (biometrics) into our passports and other existing documents in line with internat ional requirements. Right across the world there is a drive to increase docume nt security with biometrics. If our citizens are to continue to enjoy the benefits of international travel, as increasing numb ers of them are doing we cannot be left behind. It is worth remembering that 21 of the 25 EU Member States (all apart from the UK, Ireland, Denmark and Latvia) have identity cards. Already the Internationa l Civil Aviati on Organisation (ICAO) has established standa rds in the use of biomet rics in passports and a biometric British passport will be introdu ced in 2005 that will incorporate a computer chip to store a facial image biometric. The United States is introducing a biometric passport requirement for all visitors going to the US without a visa. The decision to introduc e biomet rics into existing identity documents has therefore alread y been made. Without an identity cards scheme, the majority of the population would be enrolled via existing identity documents like passports anyway. The costs involved in this would be nearly the same as implementing a comprehensive identity cards scheme available to the whole resident population, but without the added benefits.

The National Identification Register. The heart of the system. Claus e 1 of the Bill imposes an obligation on the Secretary of State to establish a central population register containing a wide range of details of every UK citizen and resident aged from 16 years and 3 months. 2. The code. Clause 2 (6) requires that every individual must be given a unique numbe r, to be known as the Nation al Identity Registration Numbe r (NIRN). This numbe r will become the “key” for government and private sector organisations to access information on the registe r and to share that information. 3. Biometrics. Clause 5 (5) requires individuals to submit to fingerp rinting and “other” means of physical ident ification. This is likely to include electronic face scanning and iris recognition. 4. The card. Clause 8 establishes the actual identi ty card, generated from and containing the information in the Register. 5. Legal obligations. Clause 15 establishes a requirement to produce the card in order to obtain public services. 6. Admi nistrative convergence. The number and the card register are used by a variety of agencies and organisat ions as their admin istrative basis. 1 (5) permits the bringing together of all registrat ion numb ers (National Insurance, NHS, etc) used by a person. 7. Cross notification. Agencies w ill be required to notify each other of changes to a person's details. Clause 19 authorises the Secretary of State to disclose details from the register to other agencies without the consent of the individual. 8. New crimes and penalties. The Bill establishes a large n umber of new crimes and offences to ensure that people comply with the ID requirements. NORTH AMERICA A Canad ian parliamentary committee has unexpectedly to ld the Canad ian Parliament that it could f ind no evidence to justify a nat ional ID card sche me. Members almost unan imously declared the proposal a waste of time and resou rces. Governmen t MP Joe Font ana, who chair s the committee, told press that the Comm ittee was still struggling to determine why an ID card was even needed. \"I think the fundam ental question of why do we need to hav e a nat ional ID card has yet to be answer ed,'' he said. (7) It was only a matter of days after the attack of Sep tember 11th before some member s of the U.S. Congre ss proposed the implementat ion of a nat ional ID card system as a way of thwart ing terrorist attacks. The nationa l ID card had been propo sed in the past as a way of stopping illegal immigration. Larry El lison, chairman and CEO of Orac le, made headl ines after 9/11, say ing: \"We need a natio nal ID card with our photograp h and thumbpr int digitized and e mbedded in the ID card\". The prospe ct of massive compute r databases or registries, soft ware data col lection systems, digital fingerprinting, handpr int scan s, facial recognit ion technologies, voice authentication dev ices, electronic retinal scan s, and other 'biometric' survei llance techno logies have sudd enly become realistic options for governmen t identification purposes. (8) Due to popu lar suspic ion of a com pulso ry ID card in the U.S., the federa l Governm ent is introducing the measur e by stealt h. On 16 Apr il 2002 , the Subcommittee Hearing on Standardizing State Driver' s Licenses proposed establ ishing a nat ional identity syst em based on the state driver's licence. The measur es proposed unspecified unique biometr ic identifiers on the new cards.

Homeland Secu rity to design stat e ID cards and dr ivers license s with biometric information such as retinal scans, fingerprints, DNA data and RFI D trackin g technology. Behind thes e proposals is a huge Governme nt spon sored research effort into biometric technology . The Office of Homeland Se curity now has a Be haviora l Research and B iometrics Science and Technology Directorate. It has awarded a three year contract to International Biometric Group LLC for research into the effects of identity determination syst ems and proc esses on internationa l travel, border man agement and ho meland sec urity. (11) The Science and Technology section of the Office of Homeland Security's National Strategy for Homeland Security , July 2002 , states that it wants to develop syste ms that can measur e 'hostile intent' and sen sors that can dete ct immunization status. (12) The section entitled Law contains proposals for increas ed information shari ng, biometr ic identification, and stan dardization of state drivers licence s. (13) Biometrics and smar t-card technologies will play a major role in the ' U.S. Visit ' proje ct, a $1 .5-10 bi llion project under the Dept. Homeland Secur ity, announced in September 2003. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 mandated the system and se t several milestones, including the collectio n of biometr ic information fr om visitors entering the U.S. by air and sea by the end of 2003 . All visitors over the age of 13 w ill now have their fingerprints take n and st ored for 75 to 100 years by the Dept. Homeland Security, which w ill be shared with oth er governm ent departme nts and age ncies, and other governments. The E.U. Regulat ion requiring biometr ic passpo rts has the secondary effect that whenever E.U. citizens travel abroad (not just to the United States), they will again be requ ired to register their fingerpr ints and face - scans with foreign governme nts as their passp orts are verified. As a result, the E.U. is drast ically enlarg ing the U.S. VIS IT programme by turn ing it against its own citizens and then globalising this practice . (14) The Transportation Security Adm inistratio n has a major cont ract in the works called the Transportation Workers Identifi cation Credential . A pilot progr am involving 10 ,000 transportation worker s is evaluating biometric technologies that can be used for governm ent, contract or, and pr ivate-sector workers at transportation facilities. (15) The Biometrics Manag ement Office (BMO) has been set up as a central procur ement agency for the U.S. Dep t. Defe nse. its motto reads, ...ensuring the right person with the right privileges has acces s at the right time to su pport war fighti ng dominance.... Biomet rics are measurable physical characteristics or personal behavioral traits used to recognize the identity, or verify the claimed identity of an individual. We are looking at: facial recognition, fingerprint, hand geome try, iris scan, signature verification, and voice recog nition.

Operat ing on the theory that an in dividual's walk is as unique as a signature, the Pentagon has financed a research project at the Georgia Institute of Technology that has been 80 to 95 pe rcent successful in identifying pe ople.

After the gam e, Tampa Bay police report ed that the techn ology pinpointed 19 people with criminal reco rds out of a crowd of 100,000. (22) Biometrics research has been guided by t he U.S. military over the past decad e. In 1992, th e Nation al Security Age ncy (NSA) initiated the Biometric Consortium , consisting of repre sentatives from six department s of the U.S. Governm ent and each of the Military Ser vices. The NSA initiated the format ion of the Cons ortium as part of its Information Syste ms Security mission, with a goa l to increase the availability of biometric authentication and i dentification to meet the need s of the Dept. Defense and other Fede ral agencies. It is cha ired by an NSA agent and i ts stated obje ctive is to build a con sensus in industry and academia around the requirement s of the NSA: [To] Create standardized testing databa ses, procedures, and protocols for the comm unity and security policy organizations.

Facilitate symposia/wo rkshops to include the participation of academia and p rivate industry. (23) 12.2 COM PUTER DATABASES USA To take advant age of the snooping pro visions in Patriot Acts I and II , a project called 'Total Information Awaren ess Network' was propos ed. Although the Governm ent officially shelv ed the plan in Septe mber 2003 due to public outrage, it will only take another terror attack to bring it back. The contr oversial programme was conc eived by ret ired Adm iral John Poindexter and was run by the Information Awarene ss Office that he headed inside the Defense Advanced Research Proje cts Agenc y (DARPA). The goal was to develop software that could exam ine the comput erized travel, credit , med ical and o ther records of Americans and other s around the world to sear ch for telltale hints of a terrorist attack. Poindex ter's office told cont ractors that he want ed the software to allow U.S. agents to rapidly scan and ana lyze multiple petabytes of information. Just one petabyte of comp uter data could f ill the Library of Congre ss more than 50 t imes.

Homelan d Security launched a Security Planning and I ntegrated Resources for Information Technology (SPIRIT) system that will combine hundreds to thousand s of legacy applications into single computer netwo rks . This will facilitate the creation of a vast federal database encompassing all the large federal agencies. Together, the contra cts for this proj ect are worth about $10 b illion. In the Information Sharing and Syste ms section of The National Strate gy for Homeland Security 2002, the Governm ent says that i t needs to link up all the IT systems of every single agency of the Fede ral governmen t in order to create accur ate terrorist 'watch lists'. More disturb ing still is the paper' s proposal to use data- mining techniq ues to interrogate this database in order to spot 'patterns of crim inal behavio ur' and detain 'susp ected terrorists' before they act. (26)(2 7)(28) The Transpor tation Security Adm inistration's Compute r Assisted Passeng er Prescreening (CAPPS II) syste m, is being developed to scre en travelers, rather like the European Schengen Information Syst em (SIS) that monitors peoples' movemen t aroun d the E.U..

Directive on Privacy and Electro nic Communications (Directive 2002/58/EC) July 2002 allows member state s to pass laws man dating the retention of the traffic and l ocation data o f all communications taking place over mobile phon es, SMS, landline telephones, faxes, e-mails, chat room s, the Intern et, or any ot her electro nic communicat ion device. The retention of the conten ts of the communicat ions are not cove red by the Directive, but t he purpos e is exactly the same as the British propo sals, app lied to 450 mi llion citizens: To keep a log of who you have phoned and when; who you have exchang ed emails with and w hen; who you ha ve sent short messages via mob ile phone to and when; which internet page s you visited and for how long. The Directive reverses the 1997 Telec ommunicat ions Privacy Directive by explicitly allowing E.U. countries to compel ISPs and tele communications companies to record, index, and st ore their subs cribers' communication s data . These requirements can be implemented for purposes vary ing from national security t o criminal investigat ions and prose cution of crim inal offences, all without specific jud icial author ization. (39) The Directive requires reco rds to be kept for up to 24 m onths. (40) The list of data t o be retained by ISP s and teleco ms companies was drawn up b y Europol as revealed in a confidential docum ent obtained by Statewat ch containing the agenda of the Expert Meeting on Cybercrime of 10th Apr il 2002. (41) At the summ it which followed the Madrid bom bing in March 2004, the E.U. accep ted a draft Framework Decision on data re tentio n at the reque st of the U.K., France, Ireland and Swede n. This strengthe ned the 2002 Directive by extending data retention to up to 3 ye ars and w idened its use from specific investigations to \"prevention and detec tion\" of crime.

In the section Information Operation s: A New War Fighting Capapility , the authors sugge st the advantag es of satellite linked implanted brain microchips over other commu nication systems. These will allow the implanted personnel to 'pull a comp uter-generat ed menta l visualization of the desired battlespace anytime, anywhere' .

Mexico's top federal prosecutors and investigator s began receiving chip implants in their arms in November in order to get access to restricted areas inside the attorney general's headqua rters, said Antonio Aceves, general director of Solusat, the company that distributes the [ADS] microchips in Mexico 12.5 RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION (RFID) Katheryn Albrecht of Consu mers Against Supe rmarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering (CA SPIAN) report s: A new consumer goods tracking system called Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is poised to enter all of our lives within five years, with profound implications for consumer privacy. RFID couples radio frequency (RF) identification technology with high ly miniaturized comput ers that enable products to be ident ified and t racked at any point along the supply chain. The system could be applied to almost an y physical item, from ballpoint pens to toothpast e, which would carry their own unique information in the form of an embedded chip. The chip sends out an identification signal allowing it to comm unicate with reader devices and o ther products embedded with similar chips. Analyst s envision a time when the system will be used to identify and track every item produced on the planet. RFID employs a numbering scheme called EPC (for 'electronic product code') which can provide a unique ID for any physical object in the world. The EPC is intended to replace th e UPC bar code used on products today. Unlike the bar code, however, the EPC goes beyond identifying product categories--it actually assigns a unique number to every single item that rolls off a manufacturing line. For example, each pack of cigarette s, individual can of soda, light bulb or package of razor blades produced would be uniquely ident ifiable through its own EPC number. Once assigned, this number is transmitted by a radio frequency ID tag (RFID) in or on the product. These tiny tags, predicted by some to cost less than 1 cent each by 2004 , are 'somewhere between the size of a grain of sand and a speck of dust'. They are to be built directly into food, clothes, drugs, or auto-parts during the manufacturing process. They are not removed from the product when it leaves the store. Receiver or reader devices are used to pick up the signal transmitted by the RFID tag. Proponents envision a pervasive global network of millions of receivers along the entire supply chain -- in airport s, seaports, highways, distr ibution centers, warehouses, retail stores, and in the home. This would allow for seamless, continuo us ident ification and tracking of physical items (and t heir owners) as they move from one place to another, enabling companies to determine the whereabouts of all their products (and o wners) at all times. The ultimate goal is 133 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"for RFID to create a 'physically linked world' in which every item on the planet is numbered, identified, catalo ged, and t racked. Sinc e the Auto-I D Center's founding at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1999, it has moved forward at remarkable speed. The center has attracted funding from some of the largest consumer goods manufacturers in the world, and e ven counts the Department of Defense amon g its sponsors. The European Central Bank is quietly working to embed RFID tags in the fibers of Euro banknotes by 2005 . With corporate sponsors like Wal-Mart, Target, the Food Marketing Institute, Home Depot, and B ritish supermarket chain Tesco, as well as some of the world's larges t consumer goods manufacturers including Procter and Gamble, Phillip Morris, and Coca Cola it may not be long before RFID-based surveillance tags begin appearing in every store-bought item in a consumer's home . (56) Confidential docum ents obta ined by CASP IAN from the AutoID Center show that the industry is fully aware of the massiv e unpopu larity of RFID techn ology but is relying on consu mer apathy to enable them to force it on the public. To reinforce this apathy , the RFID coali tion are hiring PR firms to emphasize the \"inevitability\" of its introduction. (57) Gillette introduced RFID into its pro ducts early in 2003 and combined them with technology to take a pho tograph of anyone who picked up the product off the shelf . Trials of this anti-theft techn ology were undertaken by a Tesco Store in Cambri dge U.K. (58) Tesco, the world's third largest retailer is also one of the world's largest promote rs of RFID techn ology, and has recently purchased 20,000 re aders and a ntennas for 1300 of its stor es. (59) Wal-Mart is the leading promote r of RFID use in Ame rican retailing. Meanw hile the U.S. Defe nse Dept. announced in October 2003 that by January 2005 al l its supp liers must embed passive RFID chips in each individual product where possible . (60) The European Central Bank is moving forwar d with plans to embed RFID tags as thin as a human ha ir into the fibers of Euro bank note s by 20 05, in spite of consumer prote sts. The tags would allow currenc y to record information about each transact ion in which it is pass ed. Governme nts and l aw enfor cement agencies hail the technology as a means of preventing money- launder ing, black- market transactions, and even bribery demands for unmarked bills. Howev er, consumers fear that the techno logy will eliminate the anonym ity that cash affords. (61) LOYALTY CARDS On the horizon, the consu ltants say, i s the day w hen RFID chips would allow shoppe rs to leave the store without checking out at a ll and get the bill on their credit card or store account. Stores acro ss the world already track consu mer purchase s with opt- in loyalty cards. Using R FID to reg ister sales instead of regular chec kouts would force people to use the loyalty card s in order to pay for the good s. Anonymous purchase s will become a thing of the past. Pote ntial for RFID techno logy to be used to pres cribe or proscribe what people can buy can be seen in the proposed \"Fat Tax\" wher eby sales taxes would be imposed on food s considered to cause obesity. The RFID system could be used to stop people purchasing too many o f thes e items. The \"fat tax \" idea is backed by maj or scient ific and env ironmental organizations such as WorldWat ch and The Center for Science in the Public Inter est and scientist s writing in the British Medical Journal .

If you adjust your behaviour then you may f ind your loyalty card comes back on-line. In step with the loyalty card database is the pronou ncement by U.S . Postal Service that they are going to end anonymou s use of the postal service due to the anthrax ma ilings in October 2001. The impetus for this move came directly from a President ial commission, wh ich recommend ed that U SPS introduce send er identification for every item of mail. (65) The investigation of the anthrax mailings by Dr. Leonard Horowitz and Michael R uppert foun d that the Governm ent itself was the likely culprit, showi ng once again how the prob lem-reaction- solution play is being used to man ipulate policy-makers and pub lic opinion into acce pting the police state. (66)( 67) 12.6 CAR AND MOBILE PHONE TRAC KING One of the best kept secrets in auto manufactur ing is the fact that most new cars have black box data recorders in them. Ford and Gener al Motors began phasing them in six years ago and Toy ota and H onda also use them. Ford calls it the 'Electronic Data Recorder'; GM calls it the 'Sen sing Diagnostic Module.' It's a small device that r ecords your speed, the perc entage of thrott le, your RPMs, whether you have your foot on the brake and whether your seat belt is buckled and if you get in an accident , deploys an airbag. (68) The U.K. govern ment is looking at im plement ing a nat ionwide satellite global posit ioning system (GPS ) that not only links the black b ox to a nat ional road toll database but a lso contr ols the spee d of vehic les by linking the black box to thrott le control. When the car enters a 40m ph zone the GPS will prevent the car exceeding th e speed limit. The GPS system could also be used to detect drivers who have not paid vehicle duty or insurance. Most importantly the Government will know exactly where you are at any t ime becau se GPS is accurate within ten metres. The proto type syste m for cars is currently b eing introduced in lorries in Germany and co uld be implemented in the UK by 2006. All vehicles would have to be fitted with the black box techn ology. (69)( 70) The Insti tute for Pub lic Policy Research who supp ort the GPS measure have propo sed that the national road char ge should be £1.30 per mile adding £16 b illion per year to the cost of motoring by 2010 . (71) Mobile phones contain GPS track ing ch ips which can determine the location of users within a few hundred metre s. Under the E.U. data r etention Directive, the data that can be retained includes all data generated by the conv eyance of communicat ions on an e lectronic communications network (\"traff ic data\") as well as data i ndicating the geographic position of a mobi le phone user (location data Art. 2 (b) and ( c) of Dir. 2002/58/EC ). (72) In Octobe r 2004 a new service was 135 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"launched in the U.K. by MobileL ocate, a company which enab les employers to track their emp loyees by their mo bile phone s down to 200 metres. The company says it takes just 10 to 15 sec onds for a manager to mak e a reques t to find a mobile phon e and rec eive a reply. (73) Secret Governme nt plans to turn mobile phone masts into Bi g Bro ther spy stations have been reve aled. The new system called Celldar works by ana lysing radio waves sent out by p hone masts. When these wave s hit an obje ct they are reflected to the mast. By analysing the reflectio ns, a picture can be built of moving obje cts nearby, tracki ng ve hicles and people anywhere in the U.K. us ing the country' s 35,000 masts. The Evening Standard has learned that the Ministry of Defence planned a test in Octob er 2003 b ut an Mo D spokesman said he was unable to comm ent on the project. (74) MoD is hoping to introduce the system as soon as resources allow. Police and se curity services are known to be interested in a variety of possible surv eillance applications. C elldar, is supp osedly aimed at anti-terrorism, def ence, secu rity, and road traf fic manage ment. (75) 12.7 SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS As prev iously di scussed, biometric facial recognition technology already exists. The Orwe llian implications of this are mind-boggling bearing i n mind the millions of CCTV cameras worldwide. The Pentagon is develop ing an u rban survei llance system whos e centerpiec e is groundbreaking co mputer software that is cap able of automatica lly identifying vehicles by size, color, shape, and l icense tag, or drivers and passeng ers by face. (76) In the U.S., trag ic sch ool shootings such as that at Co lumbi ne hav e led to hundreds of scho ols installing survei llance came ras. Some school districts have allowed the local police or head teache r to access the spyware via the internet and mon itor the activities of student s and staff at the click of a mouse. (77)( 78) Researchers are worki ng to give the new equipment 'X-ray v ision' - the capabi lity to 'see' through walls and lo ok into people's home s. In Februar y 2003 , U.S. Fede ral Regulators in relaxed rules on this \"ground- penetrating r adar\" technology allowing industry to develop techn ology which gives clearer images. Time Domain Corp. , based in Huntsville, Ala., demonst rated a \"through- wall motion dete ctor,\" a briefcase-sized, 10- pound device that can be held up to a wall. A pers on movin g behind the wall shows up as a colo rful blob on a sm all display. The detector is intended for use by law enfor cement, firefighters, and the military. (79) The potential military and po lice use of \"through wall survei llance\" technology develope d by Hughes corp. is discuss ed in a report by the Departm ent of Applied Mil itary Science at the Royal M ilitary College of Canada. These devices are already be ing used by po lice in California and Mexico, and are also designed for urban warf are. (80) Similar techn ology is useful f or seeing through cloth ing at a irports and ch eckpoints. (81) In Germany , EAD S (European Aeronautic Defense and Sp ace), the Bavari an Police Helicopter Squadron, and the Bavar ian Interior Ministry are collaborating on Project Autop ol (automatic object reco gnition for police helicopters) to help law enforc ement agencies track illegal residents. Autopol combines automatic target recognition (A TR) techn ology with an i nfrared camera installed in a po lice helicopter . The infrared camera pinpoints warm obje cts such as people, animals, cars, or power lines.

Defense's Inspector General found that the Pentagon couldn't properly acco unt for trillions of dollars in acco unting entries every year.

They are promoting New Age religion becaus e it is more suited to their po litical agendas. 13.1 ELITISM AND THE NEW AGE RELIGION New Age religion propo ses the ascendancy of a ruling elite un-restrained by the mora l strictures of ancient religious texts. Wher eas monoth eistic religions propos e a deit y who is apa rt from the world and judge s man for his actions, N ew Age pantheism propo ses that G od is the collective whole of every entity in the world organized into a spi ritual hierarch y. Evolution and re incarnation underp in a spiritual hierarchy headed by the Masters of Wisd om who can communicate telepath ically with the ir followers. The Masters will bring human ity into the Age of Aquariu s or The New World Order using the ir higher wisdom . These ideas stem from the Theosophical moveme nt foun ded by a Russian woman called Helena Blavatsky born in 1831. The Nazis took Theosophy seriously and H itler based his genocidal theories of master race, or superm en ( \"Ubermen schen\" ) on it. (1) Theosophy hasbe en promoted at the U.N. by The Lucis Trust which enjoy s consultat ive status with its Econ omic and So cial Counci l . (2) The U.N. is regarded by New Agers as the supr eme political instrument of the Hierarchy, wh ich is appropr iate given that the U.N. has always been contr olled by the elite . (3) Not only is panthe ism used to justify the dictatorship of a ruling elite, it also tied in to agendas such as euge nics / bioethics, popu lation cont rol, and r adica l envir onmentalism. Pantheistic Earth wo rship is promot ed at the highest level of the environmental movem ent. As an athe istic pa rallel of the ten commandm ents, the U.N. Earth Charter, a 16 point plan for human ity written by Steph en Rockefeller and M ikhail Gorbachev , has been placed in a 500 pound chest called The Ark of Hope . On page 60 of her book, Manual of the Co-Creators for the Quantam Leap , New Ager Barbara Marx Hubbard st ates that the spiritual elite will have to kill off one half of the popu lation in order to evolve hum anity to the next level: 'We are in char ge of God' s selection proce ss for Planet Earth .

The fiercely guarded, 2,700 acre retreat is the country extension of San F rancisco's all-male ultra- exclusive Bohemian Club to which every Republican President since H erbert Hoover has belonged . With its high-powered clientèle, coveted privac y and cabalistic rituals, the Bohemian Grove has prompted considerable suspicion... The most important events, however are the \"lake side talks\" (past orators: Alexand er Hague and Casper Weinbe rger). This year's speaker was Henry Kissinger on The Challenge of the '80s. (7) In July 2001 , documentary film-maker Alex Jones infiltrated Bohem ian Grove, becoming the first pers on to capture the bizarre occult act ivities of the Bohem ian Club's world leaders on videotape. (8) The centre -piece of the festivities is The Crema tion of Care , literally the torching of human compa ssion. This involves a mock human sacrif ice to the sun god Molo ch, performed in front of a forty- foot tall ston e owl. Alex Jones comm entat es: We were all focused at what was going on across the pond. Sudde nly the owl was lit up by some flood lights and o ut ran a hundr ed priests or so in black, red and g reen robes. Most of them were in black, some in red and a couple in silver or green robes. Then, out came the high priest, who went through all his incantations about the dead (who is dead at the Grove in the past, may their spirits be conjured and brought back there by the \"great owl\"). He praised the owl for about twenty minutes and h e talked about \"goodly Tyre and B abylon\". The priests went on to burn a live a h uman effigy whose cries for mercy were broadca st through a public address system . Pyrotech nics cause d metal crucif ixes around the pond to burst into flames. Religious infanticide was widespread among the ancient people s of the Eastern Mediterranean region, b ut the cult of Moloch is the most docum ented. Baal Moloch (or Molekh) 'The Bull of the Sun' was the sun god of the Phoenecian s (calle d Canaan ites in the Bible). He was conc eived in the form of a calf or an ox, or depicted as a man wi th the head of a bull. In many in stance s the bodies of children were burnt as sacrif ices, perform ed to renew the strength of the sun fire. (9) Canaan i s an anc ient term for the coun try roughly corresponding to what was later historically known as Palestine or The Holy Land , and i n modern political terms, Israel and t he Occupie d Territo ries. The Canaan ites were the Semitic inhabitants of Canaan b efore the Israelites arrived and i t seems that the Israel ites followed the Canaan ite pract ice of sacrificing ch ildren to Molech. The ritual is des cribed in The Old Testame nt 'to pass through the fire' and is strongly condemne d. (10) Tyre was an maj or comm ercial city in the Phoenic ian emp ireand many of its kings were named Baal after the sun god.

According to Reuters, 19 June 2003: Paganism and the ancient art of witchcraft are on the rise in Britain, experts said on Thursday as the summer's most celebrated Pagan f estival approached. Television, the Internet, environmentalism and even feminism have all played a role in the resurgence, they say. Soaring Pagan numbers have churches worrying and c alling for stricter controls on cult TV programs and fi lms that celebrate sorcery like \"Harry Potter,\" \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch... \"Anything that makes teenag e girls feel powerful is bound to go down well,\" joked OBOD's McCabe. Kevin Carlyon, High Priest o f British White Witche s said \"Harry Potter\" in recent years had c ontinued the trend, helping create what he called \"the fastest growing belief system in the world.\" (12) Spon sored by Exxon Mobil, 'Harry Potter Day' 2001, saw American children attendin g pub lic libraries for potion class.

Harry saw his vibrant, blurred outline towering above him, saw a wand withdra wn from a belt... He had no choice... He reared high from the floor and struck once, twice , three times, plunging his fangs deeply into the man's flesh , feeling his ribs splinter beneath his jaws, feeling the warm gush of blood... The man w as yelling in pain... then he fell silent... He slumped backward against the wall... Blood was splatter ing onto the floor... His forehead hurt terribly.

In December 2003, a law was implemented in the U.K. based on a European Union D irective which bans discrimination in the workp lace on the grounds of religion, belief, or sexual orientation . Thousands of religious scho ols, charit ies and organ izations could face legal action i f they refuse to emp loy athe ists or homo sexuals, or sack staff who become Satanist s under propo sed Governm ent regulations.

This will have the effect of stopping religious groups from crit icizing each other, and theref ore expres sing their cor e belief that the irs is the only true religion. It also sets a very dangerous precedent that the state can censor criticism of a set of beliefs. What happens when the state declares that eut hanasia o r another belief of some 'bioethics committee' falls within this prote ction? 13.5 ENFORCING LOVE OF BIG BROTH ER We have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and m an, and b etween man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated . Procreation will be an an nual formality like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our neurologists are at work upon it now.

They are accused of forcing women, mostly from Mold avia, Ukraine and Romania, into prostitution... It is an open secret in the Balkans that people- trafficking rings run through Montenegro to Bosnia and Kosovo, with profi ts from the dirty trade reac hing millions of Euros. The sex-slave routes lead to Ital y and Britain, where at least 1,400 women, mainly from eastern Europe, are tricked into prostitution each year. The trade is highly lucrative for the men who \"own\" them; in London, women can bring in about £100,000 a year for their pimps. (26) Madeleine Rees, the head of the U.N.

A revolt of the plebs would become as unthinkable as an organized insurrection of sheep against the practice of eating mutton. - Bertrand Russell, The Impact of Science on Society With the restraints of moral conv entions and d emocracy dispensed with, the new utop ia offer s the holy grail of all dictators : Control ove r life itself. Yet some of that contr ol has existed for decade s in spite of our notio nally free and demo cratic societie s. Science offers the great advantage that ve ry few people can understand it. Whoe ver pays for its conduc t and i ts presentation in the popular medi a can dictate the consensus on any given issue, simply by asser ting that h is com mittee of experts are the most distinguished. The less well funded and repre sented dissent ers are labeled the danger ous 'quacks ' and 'junk scient ists'. And this is how the petrochemical-pharmaceutical car tel has killed, injured, and steril ized mi llions of people over the last hundred years. The same forces that supporte d Hitler have continued to oper ate covertly ever since. Population co ntrol is multi-facete d. It includes: Reducing the number of people; euge nics; reducing i ntelligence levels; mind contro l; increasing poverty ; and creating f inancial depend ence on the pharmaceutica l industry. Variou s facets of the popu lation contr ol agenda can be served simultaneously by the same device. Facing up to this 21st century holocaust merely requ ires an acknowled gement of the moral posit ion of its ele vated spon sors. Some might be unashamed ly evil but most are Malthusians who believe that the there is no sanctity in human l ife. To 'save the planet' we must kill off most of the people, so said Jacq ues Coust eau in the UNESCO Courier of Nove mber 1991: The damage people cause to the planet is a function of demographics - it is equal to the degree of development . One American burdens the earth much more than twenty Bang ladesh es ... This is a terrible thing to say. In order to stabilize world popula tion, we must eliminate 350,000 people per day. It is a horrible thing to say, but it's just as bad not to say it. (1) Bertrand Russell, one of the twent ieth century 's most eminent philosopher s, said the same in his book, The Impact of Science on Society : At present the population of the world is increasing ... War so far has had no great effect on this increase ... I do not pretend that birth control is the only way in which popula tion can be kept from increasing. There are others ...

(2) Russell also support ed the idea of engin eering human b eings to meet social requirements : Scientif ic societies are as yet in their infancy . . . . It is to be expected that advances in physiology and psychology will give governments much more control over individual mentality than they now have even in totalitarian countries. Fitche laid it down that education should aim at destroying free will, so that, after pupils have left school, they shall be incapable, throughout the rest of their lives, of think ing or acting otherwise than as their schoolmaste rs would have wished . . . . Diet, injections, and injunctions will combine, from a very early age, to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable , and any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impos sible. The Nazis were more scientific than the present rulers of Russia. . . . If they had survived, they would probably have soon taken to scientific breeding. Any nation which adopts this practice will, within a generation, secure great military advantages. The system, one may surmise, will be something like this: except possibly in the governing aristocracy, all but 5 per cent of males and 30 per cent of females will be sterilized. The 30 per cent of females will be expected to spend the years from eighteen to forty in reproduction, in order to secure adequate cannon fodder. As a rule, artificial insemination will be preferred to the natur al method. . . . Gradually, by selective breeding, the congenita l differences between rulers and ruled will increase until they become almost different species. A revolt of the plebs would become as unthinkabl e as an organized insurrection of sheep against the practice of eating mutton. (3) The progressively du mbed down society described in Brave New World is desirab le to those in the ruling class who believe in 'command and contr ol'. Howev er, with the internet serving as a cou nter-weight to official disinformation , we can now afford ourse lves some prote ction against a hea lth catastro phe we might otherwise endure at their hands. 14.1 FUNDING POPULATION CONTROL Displayed on Rockefeller Un iversity's website homepage on 3 December 2003 , was a picture of a crowde d city market with the following capt ion beneath : It took from the beginning of time until 1950 to put the first 2.5 billion people on the planet. Yet in the next half-century, an increase that e xceeds the total populat ion of the world in 1950 wi ll occur, So writes Joel E. Cohen, Ph.D., Dr.P.H., professor and he ad of the Laboratory of Populations at The Rockefeller University and Columbi a University, in a Viewpoint article in the November 14 issue of the journal Science .(4) Limiting popu lation gro wth has been a preoc cupation of the European and American elite througho ut the twentieth century. The Popu lation Coun cil was establ ished in 1952 by John D. Ro ckefeller III. The multi-billion dollar World Wildlife Fund is spon sored by British and Dut ch Royalty and the elite envir onmental think-tank, The Club of Rome, counts several world leader s amongst its members. The U.N.'s popu lation con trol activities receive fund ing from all the major charit able fou ndations, especially the Ford Foun dation and 151 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Rockefeller Foun dation. T ed Turner's $1 bi llion United Natio ns Foundation and the $24 b illion Bill and M elinda Gates Foundation are entirely devo ted to popu lation control activities although they are disguised as public health campaig ns. The United Nat ions Popu lation Fund (UNFPA) is the single largest internationa l source of overt fund ing for popu lation and rep roductive health programme s. Since it began operations in 1969 , the Fund has provided near ly $6 b illion in 'assistan ce' to develop ing countries. (5) The UNFPA only manages one quarter of the world's popu lation control budget for developing cou ntries, which is in excess of $1 b illion per year. (6) The Netherlands, Br itain, and Japan were by far the biggest funders of UNFPA in 2001, providing almost 50% of the total $396 million. (7) Meanwhi le the U.S. Age ncy for International Dev elopment (USAID) gives substantia lly more money to popu lation contr ol programme s than to healthcare and food assist ance. (8) 14.2 AIMS AND METHODS - THE ART OF KILLING QUIETLY The popu lation control agenda is prese nted to the public as a un iversal concern for planetary reso urces and env ironmental p ollution, and t o a lesser degree, socio-economic deprivation, women' s rights, and repr oductive health. Whatev er the truth of these arguments, the point is that p opulation 'co ntrol' is coercive. The policy pape rs on popu lation cont rol contain obj ectives that are so extreme that coer cion would certain ly be needed to meet them. The 1972 benchmark environmental ist pub lication, The Limits To Growth, pred icted planetary melt down by 2 050 un less radical limits to popu lation growth were imposed. In 1974 , this was trans lated into har d U.S. national security po licy by National Security Adviso r, Henry Kissinge r. His lengthy National Security Study Memorandum 200 laid out the aims, timescale, and methods of U.S. foreign policy for limiting the popu lation growth of 'less er developed countries'. (9) Measures were to be taken to keep the world's popu lation growing beyond 8 billion, meaning 500 m illion fewer people by y ear 20 00 and 3 b illion fewer by 2050 . However, many susp ect that th is is nowh ere near the real target of the elite and th eir Malthus ian col laborators, which is to cut the world's current population in half . The American population control think tank , Negative Population G rowth Inc., r ecommended in 1992 that t he popu lation of the U.S. should be 125- 150 mi llion, requiring a 50% cut from its curr ent level. (10) In 1995, the same think-tank publ ished a study recomme nding an 80 % reduction in global population. (11) In NSSM 200, Henry Kissinger stated that no single appr oach would 'solve' the popu lation problem. Multiple and se eming ly unco nnected approaches are also less likely to attract attention. H ere follows a short- list of these approache s. 14.3 ENVIRONMENTALISM The environmental movem ent has been an im portant tool for justifying population reduction. As The Daily Tel egraph recently reported, banning the pestic ide DDT in the early 1970s was a huge victory for the popu lation controlle rs. DDT was introduce d as an in sectic ide in the 1940s and prom ised to eradicate malaria, one of the world's biggest natura l killers. De spite all the scient ific evidence to the contrary, the powerf ul environmental lobby d eclared it dangerous, and so it was banned. As a result , hundreds of millions of lives have been lost to malaria unnecessarily.

(13) 14.4 PUBLI C HEALTH POLICY AND WESTERN MEDICINE THE DRUGS TRUST The pharmace utical industry is a m ulti-trillion dollar business, and h ealthcare spending cons umes a significant proportion of Western GDP. One family in particular has played a key role in the development of the pharmaceutica l industry - The Rockefellers. As describ ed in chapters 2 and 4, the Rockefellers invested in the German chemica l and pharmaceutica l giant, I.G. Farben in the 1930s. Sterl ing Drug, Inc., was the main cog and l argest holding co mpany in the Rockefeller drug empire during the first half of the 20th Century. (14) Today, Rockefeller owned Bristol- Myers Squibb Inc. acco unts for nearly half of the chemo therapy sales in the world .

(25) During ear ly 1970s Lauren ce S. Rockefeller sat on the board of the Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Centre and was trustee of the Sloan Foundation. (26) The Rockefeller University arch ive reveals that the Rockefellers provided substantia l endowm ent for Memorial Sloan-Kettering. The New York Cancer Hospita l, foun ded in 1884, was one of the first hospitals devote d entirely to the research and treatment of cancer . Later known as the General M emorial Hospita l for Cancer and A llied Dise ases (1899- 1916), and t hen as Memorial Hospita l, it was vastly expanded and mode rnized in 1936 as a result of contribut ions by John D. Rock efeller II and the General Educat ion Board. The Sloan foundat ion was founded in 1934 by A lfred P. Sloan Chairman of General Motors. In 1945, the Sloan- Kettering Institute was created to conduct intensive research in oncolo gy. In 1960 the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center was formed to serve as an adm inistrat ive um brella for the hospital and i nstitute. (27) Rockefeller's modernization involved relocating M emorial to a new site just acros s the street from Roc kefeller University . (28) Nelson A. Rockefeller was a Member of Westchester County (NY) Board of Healt h from January 1933 to June 1953. (29) Westchester became home to the Phelps Hospital founded in 1952 with Rockefeller money. With a donat ion of 66 acr es on the Hudson River and $500 ,000 by the Arthur Curtis Jame s Foundation, along w ith a ple dge of $800 ,000 toward the proje ct by John D.

In 1910 , a report was produce d by the American Medical Association t hat changed the cours e of med ical history. Prev iously , American med ical education had been unre gulated and suffere d a bad reputat ion. Seeing an o pportunity, the Carneg ie Foundation offered to produce guidelines and qua lifications for med ical scho ols on behalf of the AMA. The Flexner Report, named after Abraham Flexner of the Carneg ie Foundation, in cluded recomme ndation s to strengthe n courses in pharmacology. Ro ckefeller and Carneg ie then comme nced to pour money into those institutions which conformed to the new requirements. To date, Roc kefeller, Carneg ie, Ford, Sloan, kellogg and ot her foundat ions have showered over a billion dollars on the med ical schools of Ame rica. (36) According t o The Drug Story by Maur ice Bealle, an i nvestigat ion into Rockefeller influence on medicine, the Rockefeller Fou ndation was the single largest contributor to American medical education: Harvard, with its well-publicized medica l school, has received $8,764,433 of Rockefeller's Drug Trust money, Yale got $7,927,800, Johns Hopkins $10,41 8,531, Washingto n University in St. Louis $2,842, 132, New York's Columbia University $5,424, 371, Cornell University $1,709,072, etc., etc .(37) The Rockefellers and the ir alumni have held key positions directing American public health, and were directly involved with the establ ishment of American public health institutions. I n 193 8 Jewish German researchers fleeing Hitler were welcomed at the newly founded National Institutes of Health, built on a pri vate estat e in Beth esda donated by John D. R ockefeller. (38) This is still the home of the NIH today.Nelson A. Rockefeller was Unde r Secretary of Depar tment of Health, Educatio n, and Welfare from June 1953 to January 1955 . Prior to this appointment he was Chairman , Special Committee on Defen se Organ ization from February to Apr il 1953 and afterwards, Consultant to Secretary of Defense on Organ ization of the Depar tment of Defe nse from January to April 1958. Between January 1953 and D ecember 1958 h e was Chairman of the President's Advisory Comm ittee on Government Organ ization. Rockefeller took the HEW job to reorganize the health department to meet the secrecy requirements of U.S. biological, chemical , and nuc lear weap ons programme which requ ired substantia l testing on unwitting American and Canadi an citizens, as described in the section on AIDS below.

(41) THE BUSIN ESS WITH DISE ASE Charges of genocide against the Drugs Trust are appropri ate on three counts: 1) Most pharmaceutica ls do not cure diseases; 2) Pharmaceut icals kill and injure vast numbers of people; 3) Pharm aceuticals are forced upon the publ ic by governmen ts and e ffective alternatives are denied. Given the first two charge s, it might seem impossible for the third to be accomplished in a free society.

In this way we stern publ ic health-care system is the epitome of fascism: The corp orations use governm ent to enforce a cartel at the expense of the public interest. Recent articles in the mainstream media and med ical journals have revealed the tip of the public death-care iceberg. Killing 250, 000 patients a year, doctors are the third leading caus e of death in the U.S. according to the Journal of American Medical Association . (42) A recent editorial in The Lancet (Vol. 359, No. 9313; 2002 ) warned of the corruption of Western med icine by drug companies. The editors of this most esteemed scient ific journal aske d, \"Just how tainted has medicine become [by pharmaceutical industry payoffs]?\" They concluded, \"Heavily, and damag ingly so,\" urging \"doctors who supp ort this culture for the best of intentions\" to \"have the courag e to oppo se practices that br ing the whole of med icine into disrepute.\" (43) Up to half the articles on drugs which appe ar in mainstream med ical journals are written by ghost writers employed by drug companies not the named authors. (44) Congre ssman Dan Burton has been investigat ing vaccines for four years as Chairman of the Dan Burton Committee on Governm ent Reform on The Status of Research into Vaccine Safety and Autism . He believes that con flicts of interest at the Centers for Diseas e Cont rol (CDC) are a pro blem, part icularly on the vaccine advisory pane l: This presents a real paradox when the CDC routinely allows scientists with blatant conflicts of interest to serve on influent ial advisory committees that make recommendations on new vaccines , as well as policy matte rs...

Codex Alimentar ius Comm ission launched a wor ld-wide initiative to restrict access to natura l medic ines. The Codex has been transl ated into har d law by the E.U. (48) In August 2005, T he European Food Supp lements Directive will become law acros s the E.U. including the U.K.. This will remove over 5000 vitamin formulations from U.K. shops and dramat ically cut the dosage of many other s. The Herbal Medicines Directive under consideration by the European Parliament will prevent any new herbal formu las ever coming on to the market and remove any her bal pr oduct which hasn't had a proven track record in the E.U.. The Pharmaceutica ls Directive seeks to expand the scope of the drug classifi cation. In its current wording ev en food or wat er can be included as a substanc e which 'restor es, corre cts, or modifies physiological funct ions'. The banning of over- the-count er natu ral medicine will create a two tier planetary hea lth system as the E.U. laws are imposed in other countries under World Trade Organization 'harm onization' rules which w ill include America. Natural Medicines will be available on prescription onl y for those that can afford to pay for private consu ltations whilst the state -run hea lth-care systems will continue to prescribe phar maceuticals to the public. In this way, the elite will blatantly deny most people access to ground- breaking life-extension herbal and vitamin formu lations that they thems elves will continu e to enjoy. Dr Rath states that 'N o sinister dark men stand behind the unethica l plans of the 'Cod ex Alimentarius\" commission, but unscrupulous share holders and investors of the pharmaceut ical in dustry bank on it'. (49) However, the controlling stake in the pharmaceutica l industry is held by the same tiny caba l that con trols all other major industries. They are committed to planetary de-population as their policy papers show. It is not, therefo re, just about mak ing mo ney. A challenge to the E.U.

Thomas McKeown was Profe ssor of Social Medicine in the University of Birmingham Me dical School between 1950 and 19 78. He is still regarded as a major social philosopher of medicine, and known for his importan t works on epidemiology and the pract ice and purpos e of med icine. His con clusion was that in fectious diseases were declining well before widespread vaccinat ion: The distinguished epidemiologist Thomas McKeown (1912-1988) maintained that reductions in deaths associated with infectious diseas es (air-, water-, and food-borne diseas es) cannot have been brought about by medica l advances, since such diseases were declining long before effective means were available to combat them. A paper published in the premier med ical journal, The Lancet, in January1977 by the Department of Commun ity Medicine, also indicated that vaccinat ions were not resp onsible f or the decli ne in morta lity: Vaccination, beginning on small scale in some places around 1948 and on a national scale in 1957 , did not affect the rate of decline if it be assumed that one attack usually confers immu nity, as in most major communicab le diseases of childhood. ... The steady decline of whooping cough between 1930 and 1957 is predictive of a linear exponential decay characteristic of a general and progressive lessening in the volume and spread of infection among the susceptible population. With this pattern well established before 1957 , there is no evidence that vaccination played a major role in the decline in incidence and mortality in the trend of events An even a more recent editorial stateme nt from the Journal of Pediatrics in December 1999 declared that proper sanitation was largely responsible for the early large declines in infectio us diseas es: . ..the largest historical decrease in morbidity and m ortality caused by infectious diseas e was experienced not with the modern antibiotic and vaccine era, but after the introdu ction of clean water and effective sewer systems. Again, in the August 2001 edition of the American Journal of Infecti on Control , epidemiologists conclude d that , except for the smallpox vaccination, which was introduced in 1798 and made compulsor y in England in 1853 , the overall contribution of medical innovations to the health revolution of the 1800 s is difficult to validate. Diphtheria, tetanu s, and pertussis vaccine arrived on the scene only after disease mortality rates already had been reduced significantly; measles, rubella, and polio vaccines did not become available until the midd le of the 20th century IMMUNE SUPPRESSION 160 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" Because they do not trigger a proper immune response, vaccin ations give live viruses and other live vaccine contam inants a head start in the body . Normally microorganism s have to pass through the mucous membrane s in the mout h and gastro- intestina l tract which are lined with Immunoglobu lin A. I nteraction with IgA triggers a cellular immune response which prece des the antibody/hum oral response. Injected microorg anisms bypass the mucousal /ce llular immune syste m and di rectly trigger the antibody-producing p lasma cells in the bone marrow. Th is is why vaccine manufacture s add i mmune system stimulating 'adjuvants ' such as aluminium, lipopolysac chride and squa lene. Live microorganism s also take advantage of significant im mune supp ression caused by the vaccinat ion itself. Research found that 20% of measles vaccin es recipients have chronic measles infections in their bra ins later in life indicating that live virus vaccines create great er risk of develop ing the diseas e.

On the subject of vaccines he comments: My final conclusio n after forty years or more in this busines s [medicine] is that the unofficial policy of the World Health Organization and the unoffical policy of the 'Save the Children's Fund' and... [other vaccine promoting] organizations is one of murder and genocide... I cannot see any other possible explanat ion... You cannot immunize sick children, m alnouris hed children, and e xpect to get away with it. You'll kill far more children than w ould have died from natural infection.\"It was similar with the measles vaccination. They went through Africa, South America and e lsewhere, and v accinated sick and starving children.. . They thought they were wiping out measles, but most of those susceptible to measles died from some other disease that they developed as a result of being vaccinated. The vaccination reduced their immune levels and a cted like an infection. Many got septicaemia, gastro-enteritis, etc, or made their nutritional status worse and t hey died from malnutrition. So there were very few susceptible infants le ft alive to get measles. It's one way to get good statistics, kill all those that are susceptib le, which is what they literally did .\" (59) American children receive up to forty vaccina tions before the age of two. Dr. H.H. Fudenb erg, world-renown ed immuno logist with hundreds of publications to his credit, made the following comme nts: One vaccine decreases cell-mediated immun ity by 50%, two vaccines by 70%...all triple vaccines (MMR, DTaP) markedly impair cell-mediated immunity, which predisposes to recurrent viral infections. (60) Like HIV, the measles virus is par ticularly immune suppres sing hence the danger of the live virus measle s vaccine.

Microorganism contaminat ion, is a relatively common finding in many comm ercial vaccines. One study in the journal Vaccine in 1986, found that ~6% of commer cial vaccin es tested were contaminated with a tiny bacteria ca lled mycoplasma. M ost U.S.military personnel dep loyed to the Gulf in 1990 received up to 30 vaccinat ions in a two to three day period, som e probably ex perimental and administered without proper informed cons ent. Recent studies by the Institute of Molecular M edicine found that ~40% of veteran s with Gulf War Illness were infected with mycoplasma fermentans. (62) 100% of Gulf War Illness patients who developed the motor neuron disease, amy otrophic lateral sclerosis, tested positive for syste mic mycoplasma infection.

This is believed to be respo nsible for an e pidem ic of cancer s.

Howev er Dr John Martin, an FDA scientist di scover ed in 1972 that these cells were also contaminated, th is time with a cytome galovirus. To date his requests to have the vaccine properly test ed have gone unan swered by the FDA because the manufacturer s can hide behind 'p roprietary interests'.

(69) MERCURY First manufactured in the 1930 s, thimero sal is a mercu ry comp ound containing 49.6% ethy l mercury by wei ght. Since then it has been used in some multi-dose vaccines as a preservative. Autism was relatively uncommo n before 1990 , averag ing ar ound 1 in 10,000 American children. Today it average s 1 in 150. (70) 7 out of 10 aut istic chi ldren have an I.Q below 70 points, low enough to creat e 'learing di fficulties'. Congressman Dan Burto n pred icts that i f current trends continue, there could be 4 mi llion autistic Americans in the next decad e. (71) Researchers believe that when the numb er of vaccines given to children was increased in 1990 , the public health agencies failed to take into acco unt the cumu lative mercury expo sure. A United Press Internati onal investigat ion into the vaccine controversy report ed that, depending on what vaccines a child got during that per iod, a v isit to the doctor during the 1990s may have expos ed some children to 125 times the limit on mercury set by the Environmental Pr otection Agen cy. Since the mid- 1980s the CDC has doub led the number of vaccines children get, up to near ly 40 doses before age 2. (72) On 7 Ju ly 199 9, The American Acad emy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Publ ic Health Service issued a join t statem ent calling for the removal of thimerosal f rom vaccines following a r isk assessment by the FDA. Although manufacturer s did take steps to remove it from many vaccines, there is no requirement for them to do so becau se the CDC will not take action. Dr. Mar k Geier, an e xpert witness on vaccine cases, states that major manu factur ers are still using thimerosal and th at children were being injected with mor e mercury than ever in 2003 . (73) Fluzone by Aventis Pasteur, is provided in multi-dose vials that st ill contain 25mcg of thimero sal, 25 t imes the safe level of mercury sugges ted by the FDA. (74) For this reason, Congressman Dan Burton and Dave Weldon have introduce d Bills to ban th imerosal use in vaccines. The Insitute of Medicine, wh ich ad vises the CDC on this issue, refuse s to acknowledge the dange rs of thimerosal. T his is in spite of Dr Mark Gaier's study published in the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeo ns in April 2003 (75) which con cluded that there is a st rong link betwe en thimerosal exposur e and neurode velopme nt disorders such as autism, spee ch impediments, and attention deficit disorder. Gaier no ted that on e in eight Am erican children requ ires special education due to brain impairment and t hat number is expected to rise to one in five. In February 2000, Dr Thomas Verst raeten of the National Immunization Program of the CDC produced an ana lysis of the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink, a patient recor d database that i ncludes information on children vaccinated who developed neurological disorders. These findings were never made public but they were discussed at a se cret CDC conference held on 7-8th June , 2000 at the Simpsonwood Retreat Center, Norcross, Georgia . This was top level asse mbly of 51 scientist s and phys icians, of which five represented vaccine manufact urers (Glaxosmith kline, Merck, Wye th, North American Vaccine and Aventis Pasteur).

(77) VACCINE ADJUV ANTS Dr Russ ell Blayock is a neur osurgeon and expert on excitotoxins. H e warns that mercury is not the only vaccine additive which can caus e brain damage including auti sm. (78)( 79) Substan ces called adj uvants are added to vaccines in order to stim ulate an im mune resp onse. Thes e include squa lene, aluminium, and lipopolysacc hride. The proble m with cur rent heavy vaccinat ion sche dules is that these substan ces remain in the tissues, continually stimulating the immune syste m. This is particularly bad f or the brain because its immune system cells called mi croglia, once activated, beg in to move about the nervous system, secreting num erous immune chemicals ( called cytokines and chemo kines) and pouring ou t an enormo us amo unt of free radica ls in an ef fort to kill invading organ isms. The problem is, there are no invading organ isms. It has been tricked by the vaccine into believing there are. Unlike the body' s immune system, the microglia also secrete two other chem icals that are very destructive of brain cells and the ir con necting proce sses. These chemica ls, glutamate and qu inolinic acid, are called excitotoxins. They also dramat ically increas e free radical generation in the brain. Studies of patients have shown that levels of these two excitotoxins can rise to very danger ous levels i n the brain following viral and bact erial infections of the brain. High quinolinic acid levels i n the brain are thou ght to be the cause of the dementia se en with HIV infection. A recent study by the world-renowned immunologist Dr. H. Hugh Fudenbe rg, found that adu lts vaccinated year ly for five years in a row with the flu vaccine had a 10- fold increase d risk of develop ing A lzheimer's diseas e. He attri butes this to the mercur y and a luminum i n the vaccine. I nterestingly, both of thes e metals have been shown to activate microglia and i ncreas e excitotoxicity in the brain. VACCINES AND SUDD EN INFAN T DEATH AND SHAKEN BABY SYNDROMES In the early 1970s the medical establ ishment came up with a di agnosis of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and Shak en Baby Syn drome (SBS) to hide the fact that vaccines might be killing thousands of bab ies all over the world every year. After their baby fell victim in 1997 , Alan and Francine Yurko launched The Yurko Proje ct, to expose the real cause of their son' s death .

The Center for Dise ase control acknowled ges that the peak age for SIDS - 2 to 4 months- coincides with the first round of vaccinations.

In the U.S., asthma in children has doubled in the last twent y years coinciding with the doubling of childhood vaccines. (87) In New Zealand there was a 60% increase in juveni le diabetes following a massive hepat itis B vaccinat ion programm e for newb orns. In Finland t he incidence of juvenile diabetes increas ed 147% in children under five after the introduction of three new vaccines for children in the late 1970 s. Then in the late 1980s addition of a live MM R vaccine and an e xperimenta l vaccine (Hib) resulted in anot her 62% increas e in the incidence of juvenile diabete s in children 3 months or older who received the new multiple vaccines. Interestingly, a for mer NIH investigator, Dr. J. B. C lassen, has propo sed that the increase in type 1 juveni le diabetes asso ciated with mu ltiple childhood vaccines may be avoidable by chang ing the regim en by wh ich multiple vaccines are given in childhood. (88) Merck & Co.'s docum entation on the adverse reactions to its Hepatit is B vaccine is published in the Phys ician's Desk Refe rence. Some of the inflammatory and autoim mune diseases listed include Guillain-Barre, multiple scler osis, arthritis, lupus and Steve ns-Johns on's syndrome.

(94) The science of immunology i s extremely complex but vaccinat ion crit ics believe that the fundamental problem w ith vaccines is the injection of foreign substanc es directly into the body. Heavy childhood vaccinat ion sch edules may permanently skew the immune system towards a humoral resp onse. Immune syste ms biased towar ds humora l immunity are asso ciated with autoimmune diseases and al lergies. Autoimmune diseas es can also be cause d by the virus itself as well as by modif ication t o the cellular/humoral ba lance of the immune system. Viruses and other live vaccine contaminants such as mycoplasmas frequently have surface proteins which are similar to those in the human body , particularly in the brain and nervou s system.

Not satisfied with this achievement, in July 2004, President Bush' s 'New Freedom Comm ission on Mental H ealth' recommended screening all American school children for mental illness with a view to possible tre atment with new antidepressants and ant i-psycho tic drugs. George Bush sr. sits on the board of Eli Lilly, which manu factur es Zyprexa, one of the anti-psychotics recommended by the Comm ission. (101)(102) Ritalin is prescribed to about two million American children. It has become the standard way f or teache rs and par ents to deal with unru ly children even to the point where children are being threaten ed with expu lsion or being taken into care if they do not take it. (103) Ritalin is an ideal mind control drug be cause it suppre sses the natur al energy and sp irit of young people often leaving them robotic, l ethargic, de pressed, or withdrawn . It also introduce s the idea at an early age that drugs are an acc eptable way of dealing with so cial prob lems. Europe is not be ing le ft beh ind on the quest for 'soma'. Nearly o ne in four French people are on tranqu illizers, anti depressants, anti psychotics, or other mood -altering pres cription drugs. An average of 40% of men and wom en aged over 70 in France were routinely prescribed at le ast one of this class of depend ence-creating drug , as well as some 4% of all children under nine. (104) As discussed in chapt er 11, the U.K. draft Mental Health Bill creates powers to comp el med ication for a who le range of 'disord ers of the mind.' Prozac and other SSRIs are capable of inducing psycho sis and suicidal depres sion. In the U.K., certain SS RIs have recently bee n banned from being prescribed to children after a string of suicides. The active ingredient in prozac and many other drugs is fluoride, which has been linked t o brain damag e and loss of I.Q. (see Fluorid e below). BRAIN MICROCHIPS The future of mind control and even body control, lies in electronic implants which are currently under development. The U.S. mi litary-directe d resear ch of implantab le microchips and the ir war f ighting app lications was discussed earlier in Chapter 12. Som e recent news articles describe med ical applications of microchips with mind and body control potential.

Russian army Major I. Chernishev writing in the military journal Oriente er of February1997, describes the development of a pysch otronic generat or capable of broadcas ting through telephone lines, TV, radio networks, supp ly pipes, and i ncandes cent lights.

(112) HYDRO GENATED VEGETABLE OIL For decades the public health aut horities persuade d the public that animal fats were bad a nd that t hey should con sume healthier po ly-unsaturated fats found in vegetable oils. The current hysteria regard ing cholest erol stems from research done during the 1940s and 1950s by the manufacturers of the new margari nes and 'healthy' fats made with hydrogenate d vegetable oils. The sugges tion was that cho lesterol (specifically LDL-cholest erol) was responsible for heart diseas e, which was even then beginning to increas e, due to the relatively high-fat die t enjoyed by mo st weste rners. This is not borne out by the facts. Western diets had a lways contained a relatively high proportion of red meat. In 1978 , Dr. Mary Enig also proved that cance r rates were directly re lated to consumption of vegetable oils (including hyd rogenated vegetable oils) and tota l fat intake, but not related to animal fat cons umption. T his research is often ignored by the cholest erol lobby, despite the fact that i t has been confirmed by other researchers. When food manufacturer s heat vegetable oil at very high temperatur es 250- 400 C and usua lly in the pres ence of catalysts, they unde rgo hydrogenation which turns them into saturated fats. The melting po int of the oil is raised, tur ning many prev iously l iquid oils into solids. Shelf -life is increase d, as the result ing oil is less susceptible to degrading over time. All nutritional value in the original oil is lost. T he texture of the resultant solid can be mad e to resemble that of natura l animal fats. Howeve r, during thi s proce ss, 'trans-fats' are formed which are found to caus e significant i ncreas es in blood cholester ol. Most processed food s in supe rmark ets that contain fat wi ll theref ore be laden with these potentia lly lethal trans-fats. (113) Ischaemic heart diseas e (IHD) was virtually unknown until the 1940s, when hydrogenat ed vegetable oils were introduce d. Now it is one of the biggest killer in the Western world.

(115) EXCIT OTOXINS There are a growing number of clinicians and scient ists who are convinced that a group of compo unds called excitoto xins play a crit ical role in the development of several neurolog ical disorder s. , Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills, by neuro- surgeon Dr. Rus sell Blaylock, de scribes how the commo n flavour enhanc ers monosodium glutamate , hydrolyzed vegetable protein , and Aspartam e/Nutrasweet are extre mely neuro -toxic. They literally put holes in the brain, and caus e neurolog ical diseases and cance r, as proven in an e normous body of scient ific res earch. Brain tumours grow rapidly in the pres ence of the concentration of glutamic acid. Fully aware of thes e facts, the public hea lth regulators have allowed hundreds of millions of people to consume excitotoxins for over fifty years. The swee tener Aspartame would nev er have been appro ved by the U.S. Fo od and Drug Administrat ion in 1981 w ithout lobbying by G.D. Searle Inc.( since bought out by M onsanto) head ed by Donald Rumsf eld. The FDA regu lators who approved Aspar tame went on to take jobs in the multi-billion dollar Aspartame industry. In addition to the FDA Comm issioner who left to take up a job with G. D. Searle, four other FDA officials conne cted with the approv al of Aspar tame took positions conn ected with the Aspartame industry betwee n 1979 and 19 82: The Deputy FDA Comm issioner , the Specia l Assistant to the FDA Commissioner, the Associate Director of the Bure au of Foods and Toxicology, and the Attorney involved with the Public Board of Inqu iry. (116) The Food and Drug Adm inistrat ion once listed 92 adverse reactions from 10,000 con sumer complaints and wo uld send the list to all inquirers. In 1996 the FDA stopped taking complaints and now den ies existence of the report. In September 2004 , a $350 million class action lawsuit was filed aga inst Monsanto.

Today, the soyb ean is America' s third largest crop (harve sting 72 million acres in 1998), supp lying more than 50 p ercent of the world's soybe an demand. Most of these beans are made into animal feed and are manufactured into soy oil for use as vegetable oil, margar ine and short ening . For more than 20 years now, the soy industry has concentrat ed on finding alternat ive uses and new markets for soyb eans and soy byproduct s. It can now be found disguised as everything from soy cheese, milk, burgers and hot dogs, to ice cream, yogurt, vegetable oil, baby f ormula and f lour. Thes e are often marketed as low-fat, dairy-free, or as a high-protein , meat substitute for vegetarians . But soy isn't always ment ioned on food labels. Today, 60% of the food on Ame rica's supermark et shelves contain soy derivatives (i.e. soy flour, textured vegetable protein , partially hydroge nated soy bean o il, soy protein isolate).

The total - something like US$80 million annually - support s United Soybean 's programme to strength en the position of soybea ns in the marketplace. Public relations firms help con vert research projects into newsp aper articles and advert ising copy , and l aw firms lobby for favourab le governm ent regulations. I MF money funds soy proce ssing plants in foreign countries, and fr ee trade policies keep soybean abun dance flowing to overseas destinations. T he push for more soy consumption has been relentless and g lobal in its reach. (121) On 25th Octobe r 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Adm inistration (FDA) decided to allow a hea lth claim for product s \"low in saturated fat and cholester ol\" that contain 6 .25 grams of soy protein per serving. The best market ing strategy for a product that is inherently unhealthy is, of course, a hea lth claim. Two senior U.S. government scient ists, Drs. Daniel Doerge and Daniel Shee han of the National Center for Toxicolog ical Research, broke ranks with the FDA, claiming that soy could i ncrease the risk of breast cance r in women, cause brain damage and t hyroid disorders, and cau se sexual abnormalities in infants. They wrote an in ternal protes t letter warning of 28 st udies revealing toxic effects of soy, mostly focu sing o n chem icals in soy known as isoflavone s, which have effects similar to the fema le hormone oestro gen. (122) They pointed to a maj or study of 3,734 Japane se American men which found that soy cons umption was associated with increased brain shr inkage in middle age, in creased cognitive impairment and A lzheimer's disease. (123) Soy has the highest level of glutamic acid of any p lant food, theref ore it has an e xcitotoxic effect on the brain. (124) In May 2003, the U.K. Govern ment's Com mittee on Toxicit y of Chemica ls in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment issued a report on phytoe strogens and hea lth.

(126) A study of babies born to vegetarian mother s, published in the British Journal of Urology in January 2000, indicated just what those changes in baby's development might be. M others who ate a vegetarian di et dur ing pre gnancy had a fivefold greater risk of delivering a b oy with hypospadias, a b irth defect of the penis. The authors of the study sugge sted that the caus e was greater exposur e to phytoest rogens in soy food s popul ar with vegetarians. (127) Early mat uration in girls is frequently a harb inger for problems with the reprodu ctive system later in life, including failure to menstruat e, infertility and breast cancer. (128) In short, soy is certain ly nat ure's contraceptive and may a lso be affecting t he sexual charact eristics and sex ual orientat ion of future generations. It is recognized that t ransexual ity is a me dical condition caus ed by the effect of hormonal aberrat ions on the brain of the developin g foetus.

These are some of the points Dr Hirzy made to the committee: - According to a study by the National Institute of Dental Research , 66 percent of Ame rican children in fluoridated commu nities show the visible sign of over- exposure and fluoride toxicity, dental fluorosis. - In 199 8, the results of a fifty-year fluoridation experiment involving Kingston, New York (un- fluoridated) and Newburg, New York (fluoridated) were published. In summary, there is no overall significant d ifference in rates of denta l decay in children in the two cities, but chi ldren in the fluoridated city show significantly higher rates of dental fluorosis than ch ildren in the un- fluoridated city. -There is epidemiological evidence showing e levated bone cance r in young men related to consu mption of fluoridated drinking water . 173 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"- In 199 0, the results of the Natio nal Toxicology Program canc er bioassay on sodium f luoride were publ ished, the initial findings of which wou ld have ended fluoridation.

He began researching chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/ Myalgic enc ephalomyelitis (ME), but over a number of years he came to the conclusion a who le range of chronic diseases had a comm on cause, and that thi s was most likely a biological warfare agent developed by the U.S. mi litary. Much of the groundwor k had a lready been prepar ed, not least by the book Emerging Viruses: AIDS and Ebola, published in 1996. Harvard Public Health graduate and pract icing d entist, Dr. Leon ard Horowitz docum ented how AIDS was manufactured in the laborator ies of American universities and U .S. m ilitary biological warfare contractor s during the 1960s and 70s. T he programme was secret until 1972 , when it was publ icly named the 'War on Cancer '. Dr. Horowitz's research confirmed the ideas of Californian pharmacolog ist, Dr. Robert Strecker.

Howev er, Emerging Viruses did not addr ess the key quest ion posed by the AIDS dissident s such as Dr. Peter Duesberg: Does HIV really caus e AIDS? Donald Scott's resea rch into the sympt oms of CFS, AI DS and ot her neuro- systemic diseases sugge sts that they are consistent with chronic mycoplasma infection, a strain of tiny bacter ia. Until quite recently, most doctor s hadn't even heard of mycoplasma even though it is docume nted in the scienti fic literature going back a hundred years. Mycoplasm a fermentans was identified by I.G. Farben during WWII and was one of the biological agent s tested on prisoners in the concentration camps. Unlike viruses and conven tiona l bacteria, mycoplasm a are depend ent on the uptake of pre-formed sterols from host cells. This means they can feed off the vital hormone s produced by the endocrine glands. On page 39 of SVCP report no. 9,1972, the project leaders state that, in order to 'activate' retro-viruses (HIV is one), it was first necessary to suppre ss the immune system by, 'physiolog ical alteration of the endo crine balance'. Certa in pestic ides and chemica ls were also noted to hav e this eff ect, which does lend support to the AIDS dissident s belief that tox ic drugs can cause AIDS. Furthermore, on page 287, it is reveale d that the National Institutes for Health contract with Dr. L eonard Hayfi ck of Stan ford University t o procure and st udy mycoplasmas was initiated in 1964, when SVCP began. World expert on mycoplasm a, Dr. Garth Nicolson agrees that they cause immune suppr ession and ther efore enhance the pathogene sis of HIV: Pathogenic Mycoplasma species may influence HIV patho genesis by specific and direct activation or suppression of the immune system. (139) Dr. N icolson' s professional exper tise in Polymerase Chain Reac tion testing also brought him to the conclusion that similarities between the surface compo nents of both organisms enables mycoplasma fermentans to bind to HIV. He was round ly attacked by scienti fic col leagues when he sugg ested that t he HIV -1 envelope gene had been inserted into certain myco plasmas in the laboratory : Mycoplasmas possessing the HIV-1 env gene could allegedly have been engineer ed to make them more invasive and p athogenic and m ore difficult to find. The HIV-1 env gene encodes a surface glyco protein, gp120 , that is involved in virus a ttachment and entry into cells through r eceptors on the cell surface. This could result in opportunistic cell attac hment and p enetration of many types of cells and m ost tissues . (140) The possibi lity that mycoplasma and HIV work togeth er as a 'binary' biological weapon is indicated by the existence of a U.S. Ar my patent on mycoplasma fermentans incognitu s strain , filed by Dr. Shyh-Ching Lo in 1991.

Dr. Lo states: 'the human r etroviruses have not fulfilled Koch's postulates, ie. producing transmiss ible AIDS-like disease s in experimenta l animals'. When the researchers infected human t-cells with HIV in the test tube, they eventual ly recovered from the initial cytocidal effects and rema ined persistently i nfected. Howev er when M. fermentans incognitus was added, th e cells died. Outside of the laborato ry, the army researchers reported that 26 out of 32 pat ients (81.25%) with HIV and showi ng symptoms of AIDS were infected with M. fermentans incognitu s . (142) Dr. Lo concluded that this organism was indeed a very likely co-factor in the progres sion of AIDS. The pate nt also states: Some of these patients who are infect ed with M. fermentans incognitus will be patient s who have been diagnosed as having AIDS or ARC, chronic fatigue syndrome, Wegener's diseases, sarcoidos is, respiratory distress syndrome, Kibuchi's diseas e, autoimmune diseases such as as collagen vascular disease and Lupus and chronic debilitating diseas es such as Alzhe imer's disea se. Dr. N icolson' s research on mycoplasm a has also confirmed the significance of a mycoplasma in a wide range of neuro -systemic degene rative disease s. 100% of Gulf War Illness patients who developed amyo trophic lateral sclerosis tested positive for mycoplasma infection. 7 out of 8 were posit ive for mycoplasma fermentans strain . (143) Overal l ~40% of veterans with Gulf War Illness were infected with mycoplasma fermentans. (144) He also found myco plasma infection in 50% of North Ame rican patients with rheumatoid arthr itis; in 51% of North American patients with CFS; and i n 69% of European patients with CFS. (145)(146) The co-discove rer of HIV, Dr. Luc Montagnier , warns that AIDS research should not neglect the role of cofac tors. In par ticular he emphasizes the need to research the mycoplasma as a virulence factor of HIV: [i]t is a deplorable fact that t o this day, the number of researchers interested in this line of investigation worldwide barely exceeds the numb er of fingers on both hands. (147) The reason why off icial public hea lth policy has ignored the role of the mycoplasma and f ocused on HIV is because mycoplasma is a type of bacteria and therefo re can be treated succ essfully with long-term adm inistrat ion of inexpensive antibiotics such as doxycy cline. The U.S. Army patent reads: M. fermentans incognitus is known to be sensitive to a number of antibiotics, including doxycycline, quinalones such as ciprofloxacin, chloramp henicol and tetracycline. Therefore, effective treatme nt of any of the above implicated diseases should include administration of antibiotics to which M. fermentans incognitus is sensitive. This is this is not a popular idea with the multi-billion dollar AZT industry. PCR testing for mycoplasm a is not offered by the U.K.'s National Hea lth Service, or indeed any p ublic healt h service in the world. Only a ha ndful of specialist research laboratories offer these tests. Dr. N icolson' s work on testing and treating G ulf War Illness victims for mycoplasma infection has been rejected and even sabotaged by the U.S. Def ense Dept.

For U.S. farmers this has meant: 1. Legally-binding agre ements that for ce farmers to purchase expen sive new seeds from the biotech corporations each seas on; 2. Having to buy thes e corp oration s' herb icides (at a cost considerab ly above that of a generic equivalent) for herb icide-tolerant crop s; 3.

The development of so-called `tra itor techno logy' crops on which part icular chemicals w ill have to be applied if the crops' GM characteristics (such as their time of flowerin g or disease resistance ) are to show; 5. The invention of `termin ator technology ' that stops GM plants producing fertile seeds; thus farmers are phys ically prevented from sowing saved seed and have to buy new seed from the biotech firms instead; and 6. Biotech firms buying up se ed companies. This creates monop olies and limits farmers ' choices still further. DuPont and Mo nsanto are now the two largest seed comp anies in the world . As a result of their contr ol of the seed industry, farmers are reporting th at the availability of good non-GM seed varieties is rapidly disappear ing. According t o the UK Soil Associatio n: ' All non- GM farmers in North America are finding it very hard or impossib le to grow GM-free crops. Seeds have becom e almost completely contaminated with GM organ isms (GMOs), good non-GM varieties have become hard to buy, and there is a high risk of crop contaminat ion.' The U.K. Governme nt's official adviser on GM, the Agriculture and Env ironment Biotechnology Com mission (AEBC ), has said it would `be difficult and in some places impossib le to guarantee ' that any Br itish f ood was GM-free if comm ercial growing of GM crops went ahead . In North America, farmers can no longer be certain the seed they plant does not contain GM genes.

The ability to deploy this technology for global depopulation w ithout dete ction must be extremely tempt ing for the Malthus ians since droughts, hurricanes, and fl oods can be blamed on natura l weather variability, solar fl ares, and global warm ing. A study of future military strategy called Airforce 2025 was drawn up by the U.S. Air University in 1996 . (163) In the section entitled Weather as a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weath er in 202 5, the authors state that altering weath er patterns will eventually becom e an \"integral part of U.S. national security po licy with both dome stic and i nternat ional applications\". By 2025 the Air For ce fully expe cts to be able to influence the weather \"on a mesoscale (<200 sq km) or microscale (immediate local area) to ach ieve operationa l capab ilities.\".... \"Achievin g such a highly accurate and reasonably precise weath er-modification capabi lity in the next 30 years will requ ire overcoming some challenging but not insurmoun table technologica l and l egal hurd les,\" the report said.

People have always wanted to cont rol the weather and the ir desire will compe l them to collectiv ely and continuously pursue their goal,\" the report concluded. The military also aim to deny an enemy satellite communication cap abilities by m odifying the Earth's ionosph ere. One of the stated objectives of the U.S. Defe nse Dept.' s High Frequ ency Active Auroral Re search Program (HAARP) is to, 'simu late and control ionosph eric processes that might al ter the performan ce of communicatio ns and survei llance syste ms'. (165) The HAARP ionospheric Research Facil ity was established in Gakona, Al aska on 18th Octob er 1993. HAA RP can beam 3 .6 Gigawatts of high frequen cy radio ener gy from earth based antennae into the ionosph ere. (166) According t o the HAARP website factsheet: Interest in the ionosphe re is not limited to the US: a five -country consortium operates the European Incoherent Scatter Radar site (EISCAT), a premier world- class ionospheric research facility located in northern Norway near Tromsø. Facilities also are located at Jic amarca, Peru; near Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod (\"SURA\") and Apatity, Russia; near Kharkov, Ukraine and in Dushanbe, Tadzhikistan .

However the U.S. patent on HAARP's technology states that i t can serve as a giant ionosph eric heater : In such experiments, certain regions of the ionosphere are heated to chang e the elect ron density and temperature within these region s. This is accomplished by transmitting from earth-based antennae high frequency electr omagne tic radiation at a substantial angle to, not parallel to, the ionosp here's magnetic field to heat the ionosph eric particles primar ily by ohmic heating. The electron temperature of the ionosphere has been raised by hund reds of degrees in these experiments , and electrons with several electron volts of energy have been 183 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"produced in numbe rs sufficient to enhance airglow. (168) The disclosure section of the patent adds: The production of enhanced ion ization will also alter the distribution of atomic and m olecu lar constituents of the atmosphere, most notably through increased atomic nitrog en concentration. The upper atmo sphere is normally rich in atomic oxygen (the dominant atmospheric constituent above 200 k m altitude), but atomic nitrogen is normally relatively rare. This can be expected to manifest itself in increased air glow , among other effects....This invention has a phenomenal variety of possible ramifications and p otential future developm ents. As alluded to earlier, miss ile or aircraft destruction, deflection, or confusion could result, particularly when relativistic particles are employed. Also, large regions of the atmosphere could be lifted to an unexpectedly high altitude so that missiles encounter unexpected and u nplanned drag forces with resultant destruction or deflection of same. Weather modification [empha sis added] is possible by, for example, altering upper atmosphere wind patterns or altering solar absorption patterns by constructing one or more plumes of atmospheric particles which will act as a lens or focusing device . HAARP is clearly one of the weat her mod ificatio n techn ologies known to the authors of 2025 . The world's forem ost independent investigator of HAARP is the author of Angels Don't Play this HAARP , Dr. N ick Begich from Alaska. He explains: HAARP zaps the ionosphere where it is relatively unstable. A point to remember is that the ionosph ere is an active electrical shield protecting the planet from the constant bombardment of high-energy particles from space. This conducting plasma, alon g with Earth's magnetic field, traps the electrical plasma of space and holds it back from going direc tly to the earth's surface, says Charles Yost of Dynamic Systems, Leicester, North Carolina. \"If the ionosphere is greatly disturbed, the atmo sphere below is subsequently disturb ed. \" (169) Dr. Begich also considers the role of weather modification as a weapon of mass destruction: In 1966, Professor Gordon J. F. MacDonald was associate director of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the University of California, Los Angeles, was a member of the President's Science Advisory Committee, and later a member of the President's Council on Environmental Quality. He published papers on the use of environment al-control technologies for military purposes. MacDonald made a revealing comment:\"The key to geophysical warfare is the ident ification of environmental instab ilities to which the addition of a small amount of energy would release vastly greater amounts of energy.\" MacDonald had a number of ideas for using the environment as a weapon system and he contributed to what was, at the time, the dream of a futurist. When he wrote his chapter, \"How To Wreck The Environment\", for the book Unless Peace Comes,he was not kidding around . In it he describes the use of weather manipulation, climate modification, polar ice cap melting or destabilization, ozone depletion techniques , earthqua ke engineering, ocean wave control and brain wave manipulation using the planet's energy fields. He also said that these types of weapons would be developed and, when used, would be virtually undetectable by their victims.

Dennis Kucin ich, Dem ocratic Congre ssman and former head of the Armed Services Oversight Comm ittee, propo sed to the 107th Congres s, The Preservation of Space Act, HR2977 . This called for a ban on space based weapons with specific reference to HAARP in section (c): The term `exotic weapons systems' includes w eapons designed to damag e space or natural ecosystems (such as the ionosphere and upper atmo sphere) or climate, weather, and tectonic systems with the purpose of induc ing damage or destruction upon a target population or region on earth or in space. (172) In the same bill, Dennis Kucinich listed 'chemtrai ls' as one of the space based weapon s to be banned. Th is is a high altitude aircraft spraying programm e in the U.S. and Europe, observed with increasing frequenc y over the past two years. Unlike normal jet engin e condensation trails - which form when hot engine exhaust mom entarily conde nses in the frigid strato sphere like exhaled b reath on a cold day - chemica l trails linger for hours, turning clear skies into milky haze in a proc ess the U.S. Air Force calls \"aer ial obsc uratio n\". What is bein g sprayed isn't clear, on ly the milky streaks acros s the sky often forming gr ids, are evidence of the programme. The U.S. Airforce's Boeing KC- 135s appear to be the main source of chemtrai ls in North America. (173) The Hugbes Aircraft Company hold a patent on a m echan ism for spray ing the atmospher e with aluminium ox ide via jet engine exhaust fumes. (174) Some researchers believe that some of the metals being sprayed, espe cially barium, are designed to interact with the electromagn etic frequencies being generated by HAARP. Finally, in relation to possible mart ial law scenarios and t he recent and b izarre power outages that affected 50 m illion Am ericans and Canad ians in August 2003, and then hit London, Italy and Denm ark a month later, HAARP 's website reads : Ionospheric disturbanc es at high latitudes als o can act to induce large currents in electric power grids; these are thought to cause power outages .

BIOLO GICAL WARFA RE 'Rebuilding Americas Defenses' by the Ame rican think-tank PNAC states that race specific bio weapons could be a 'pol itically useful tool.' Furthermore the epidemiology of the global AIDS pandem ic indicates that the population contro l agenda does have a bias against blacks. 70% of the world's 42 m illion AID S cases are in sub- Saharan Africa. Afr ica makes up on ly 14% of the world's population. 40% of American AIDS victims are black; blacks make up on ly 13% of the Ame rican population. (178) CLONING A cloned human e mbryo does not result from the random union of sperm and egg, but from a proc ess called somatic cell nuclear transfer, in which the nucleus contain ing DNA from a cel l of one individual is put into an egg whose nucleus has been removed. The resulting cloned embryo becomes virtually genetica lly identical to the individual whos e DNA was inserted into the enucleated egg. (179) In Octobe r 2003 ITN news reported that at the University of Kentucky the first cloned human embryo was ready to be implanted into a surr ogate mother for the purpos e of cloning children. (180) EUTHANASIA Polls show that most people favour assiste d suicide, bel ieving in the right to die with dignity. However, other side of the coin i s that the elite want the right to terminate us and t o legalize euthanasia for this purpose. In December 1999 , a senior consultant at a L ondon hospita l voiced concern that t here was a po licy of \"involuntary e uthanasia\" by d epriving elderly patients of food and water. (181) The British charit y Age Concern states that there is a po licy of not resu scitating seriously i ll elderly pat ients. (182) The chilling expos e of euthanasia in the U.S. Forced Exit by We sley J. Smith, reveals how people entering hospital sign \"living wills\" allowing the hospita l not to resu scitate them if they fall into a co ma, only to find they are used by the hospit al to deny patients treatment. (183) In the U.K. docto rs can and do put 'do not resuscitate ' on patients medica l records without their con sent.

In this sci- fi drama , The City of The Master s was home to an unse en elite who occasionally ventured out into the coun tryside in giant three -legged machines to lord it over the techn ologically impove rished populace . Children wou ld be taken up into the Tripods to undergo 'capping', t he surg ical attachment of an e lectrica l circuit to their skul ls. Unlikely as it is that we will open the curtains one morning to find a 30 metre tall metal leg in front of the window, the Tripods contains the essential theme of our curr ent pred icament : The dawn of a new dark ag e of global techno cratic feudali sm. Most human b eings are targeted for exterminat ion and the rema inder wi ll be indentured on the global plantation. The 'sort of charact er' that the author ities consider desirable is the diseas ed, impover ished, infertile, sexles s, dumbed down automaton, whose function in life is merely to enact the Mast ers' business plan. Some of the charact er-altering weaponry alread y at their disposal i ncludes: Media bra inwash ing; wate r fluoridation; vaccin ation; gender altering food s and chemicals; neuroto xic food additives; and psych otropic drugs. Life expectancy is being gradua lly reduc ed by the modern day con centration camp which masquerade s as the public healt hcare syste m. On the horizon are: Implantable microchips; vaccines to alter brain chemistry; genetically mod ified pharmacolog ical food; human c loning; and nanote chnology Under pend ing U .K. legislation, the process of generationa l transfor mation will be monitored on a special children's database . Family life will be replaced by a gigantic we lfare apparatus and state contr olled ch ildcare. Privacy will becom e an alien con cept. Citizens will be permanently l ogged on to the Big Broth er surveillance grid, through the ir implanted microchip , the face scanning CCTV in the stree t, the RFID tracking ch ips in every supe rmark et product, and the biometr ic identification that acc ompanies every transaction. Governm ent will have instant access to all public and pr ivate sector databases. Don't think of getting in your car and h eading for hills. Under current proposals, Big Brothe r will be able to track cars by satel lite and di sable them by remot e control. Think you can escap e to anot her country? Sorry, under world governmen t, there is no 'other coun try'. The Tripods series ended with the heroe s fleeing acros s the Alps with the ir giant thre e-legged oppres sors in hot pursu it. If you want to escape, think about becoming an astro naut. 199 The Police State Road Map (March 2005 Edition) www. policestateplanning.com"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":" How about joining the rebel force s? Well, this may l and you in some serious hot water. L iterally in hot water, becaus e already, the U.S. Government is shipping out 'terrorists' to foreign cou ntries to be tortured.

What about voting the regime out? Vote s cast on electronic voting mach ines will disappear straight down the memory hole. A DIFFERE NT COURSE How did we get into th is mess? Observing that the gap between rich and poor was getting w ider, the BBC' s Jeremy Paxman wondere d whether some one could become too rich. The capitalist system is desti ned to create a financial elite as the big fish get bigger and b igger. The financial barons prov ide the money and organ ization for all the utop ian dreamers who believe in a command and con trol society. But the Devil's greatest trick is to persuad e man th at he does not exist . The ablility of the hidden hand to man ipulate policy depends upon conc ealment. It has been assisted by the widespread apathy towards public affairs, generate d largely by the relative tranqu illity of life in the West over the last sixty years. Howev er, through the internet, it is beco ming much easier to dem onstrate and communicate both the exist ence of the cartel and t he cumu lative toxicity of its var ious activities.
