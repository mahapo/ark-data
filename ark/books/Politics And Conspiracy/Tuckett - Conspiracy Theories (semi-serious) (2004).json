Beliefin conspiracy theories is more than just the belief in an occasional underhand plot. It is a belief system that asserts that world events are being governed in secret by a group of ultrapowerful puppeteers behind the scenes. While little may be done about this sorry state of affairs, at least we can have the satisfaction ofhaving worked out what is going on. Ofcourse, one can argue that obsession with conspiracy theories serves only to demonstrate the lunatic paranoia running rife in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Much talk about conspiracies is dismissed as paranoia and much of it is paranoia. But in reality, history has proved all too well that politicians lie, presidents lie and bureaucrats lie.

It be- comes not only interesting and revealing but an absolute priority to question authority and, more specifically, the authoritarians. Why is it that we can accept that Tony Blair’s smile is as broad as it appears? Or that the American CIA assassinated the president ofChile, but we cannot believe that they would assassinate their own? Why is it that we can accept that gov- ernments would experiment on their citizens with pluto- nium, syphilis and nerve gas, but don’t consider that they would use the AIDS virus? Why did the German populace accept in the first place that Hitler was trustworthy? Conspiracy theories are not new. It is believed that Nero concocted an elaborate tale to shift the blame to the Chris- tians for the burning of Rome. Hitler was a master of such deceit. And, undoubtedly, when conspiracies fail to accu- rately predict world events, this only serves to prove their credibility. Double bluff is refined to an art form. It cannot be denied that controversy has often accom- panied many of the pivotal turning points of Western civi- lization. Many major events, for better or for worse, have occurred as the result of people behind the scenes who have held the keys to the actions ofthe world. Startling dis- coveries, often stretching far back into history, can affect the very way our Western thought processes and behavior patterns are conducted. And that is not to mention such ter- rifying revelations as the Elvis Killed Kennedy conspiracy or the real reason for Santa’s oversized hat.

But is it possible that the war began be- fore this date? Some people point to U.S. government complicity in the events of 9/11, either by not doing enough to prevent it, or—more ominously—by actively planning for it. Whatever the truth may be, there is plenty of conjec- ture that what happened on that day doesn’t add up to the popular version of the events. What is not in dispute is that public support for the War on Terror was far greater after these attacks than it would have been on September 10, 2001. Could it be that the at- tacks were allowed to happen to create public clamor for a war that would otherwise have been inconceivable? Many people have pointed to the possibility that 9/11 was a clone ofPearl Harbor, an attack on the U.S. that was deliberately allowed to take place in order to further the war aims of a president. But a more sinister comparison has been made by those skeptical ofthe motives ofthe Bush administration. They claim that what happened was more akin to Adolf Hitler’s burning of the Reichstag, the German Republic’s parliament, on February 27, 1933. Hitler blamed the fire on 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 3"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"4 Conspiracy Theories Communists plotting against the state. But historians widely accept the view that a member of the Prussian interior ministry set fire to the building deliberately, on Hitler’s orders. Immediately after the fire Hitler announced an emergency decree which suspended the normal civilian rights and liberties of citizens and gave the government enormous authority to impose order. This was the begin- ning of the end for democratic values and the rise of Nazi dictatorship. On October 3, 2001 Congress approved Bush’s Patriot Act, a similar bill which reduced the civil liberties of Americans and allowed the detention without trial of any- one the government deemed a potential “security threat.” Furthermore, the public and political pressure for retalia- tion for the attacks was intense, and neatly tied into the agenda of the “Project for a New American Century.” This was a strategic document put forward by a group of neo- conservatives in September 2000 outlining a new strategy for American global dominance in the twenty-first century. This think tank included Dick Cheney, the vice president; Donald Rumsfeld, secretary of defense; Paul Wolfowitz, his deputy; Jeb Bush, brother of George and governor of Florida; and Lewis Libby, the leader of Bush’s 2000 elec- tion campaign team now working in the White House. The most intriguing part of the document concerns the readjustment ofAmerican forces across the globe. The re- port states that only an incremental approach can be taken to this radical restructuring owing to political and public constraints, unless there was “some catastrophic and cat- alyzing event like a new Pearl Harbor.” Despite all this, however, there is still the question of how such an elaborate attack could have been prepared and executed by the government and its agencies without the media becoming deeply suspicious. The most likely expla- nation is that the attacks were planned by Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda but that U.S. intelligence agencies did not act upon the information they received to adequately prevent them. Evidence of their failure, whether deliberate 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 4"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"9/11 5 or through incompetence, has been widespread following Congressional investigations but without any smoking gun. Furthermore, the CIA and New York City counterterrorism offices were based in Building 7 ofthe World Trade Center and were therefore destroyed, along with any potentially incriminating evidence. The suspicions about intelligence are just part of the growing mistrust about the events that day, which reverber- ated right around the world. On the day of the attacks geo- logical surveys in NewYork recorded the greatest amount ofseismicactivityasoccurringimmediatelybeforetheTwin Towers collapsed, and not when they hit the ground. This has led many people to the conclusion that the towers were blown up with explosives underneath the building and not by the enormous volume of fuel that ignited after the two airliners exploded; a belief reinforced by the way the tow- ers imploded inwards instead of collapsing sideways. The evidence at the Pentagon also raises profound ques- tions. Why was the Pentagon hit on the one side of the building that happened to be empty on the day of the at- tacks owing to refurbishment? Why was there no visible evidence of a destroyed airliner among the debris? Why were no fighter jets scrambled to intercept the hijacked air- craft until after the third plane had hit the Pentagon, de- spite it being a legal requirement in the U.S. for fighter jets to be scrambled whenever a commercial airliner veers sig- nificantly offits flight path? How was so much information known about the hijackers and released to the media by the FBI so soon after the attacks, including details on a pass- port miraculously found among the rubble of the Twin Towers? These question marks raise serious doubts about the of- ficial version of what happened on September 11. Many are cynical of the report published only a year prior to that date; a report which would revolutionize America’s role in the world toward ultimate military, political and social hegemony, but one which would require a catastrophic event.

And questions surrounding the assas- sination arose immediately. Was Booth solely responsible for the assassination? Or was he simply a tool in a much larger conspiracy? The vice president’s role in the whole mystery is unclear to say the least. About seven hours before the assassination ofthe president, Booth stopped at the Washington hotel, res- idence ofAndrew Johnson, the vice president. Learning that neither Johnson nor his private secretary were present, Booth wrote the following note: “Don’t wish to disturb you. Are you at home? J. Wilkes Booth.” Johnson’s private secre- tary testified to the fact that he found the note later in the af- ternoon. So from this can we assume that Johnson and Booth knew each other? Many people thought that Johnson was involved with the assassination, and a special Assassination Committee was established to investigate any evidence linking him to Lincoln’s death. Nothing suspicious was ever found by the committee, yet a belief that he was in some way involved continued for many years. It certainly seems suspicious 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 7"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"8 Conspiracy Theories that Booth should have sought him out so shortly before the assassination. Of course, rather than having been controlled by some- one else, Booth himself could have been in control of a number of coconspirators who were then either hanged or imprisoned at Ft. Jefferson. Booth could have been defend- ing Southern values of slavery and racism. The assassina- tion could have been a rather more dramatic solution than was initially intended. Booth may have intended merely to kidnap the president and to demand prisoners of war in re- turn. The assassination could have been a simple step fur- ther when the kidnapping plans fell through. It would appear, according to a series of letters found in Booth’s possession, that he knew of a plot to blow up the White House. Certainly if this was the case, if the plot had disintegrated, more daring and radical planning would have been necessary in order to carry out the original ob- jectives of the conspirators. In this sense, perhaps the orig- inal plot was far smaller in scale and the whole thing was a reckless afterthought when original plans went wrong. Lincoln had made himself a considerable number of enemies as a result of his financial policies. His Civil War efforts had eaten into his financial resources but he had de- clined high-interest offers of loans from European bankers led by the Rothschilds and had found other ways to fund the war. More importantly, the British bankers opposed Lincoln’s protectionist policies. Some Englishmen in the 1860s believed that “British free trade, industrial monop- oly and human slavery travel together.” Lincoln was thus viewed as a threat to the established order of things and was possibly assassinated as a result. 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 8"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"AIDS A IDS is quite possibly one of the most horrific devel- opments this past century.

The official line has it that the area is a military test- ing range. The only concrete information we have is geographical—we know that it is to the north of Las Ve- gas. Beyond that, we enter into a whole web of cover-up and conspiracy. Few people know what really goes on. Curtained off by a no-fly zone, it seems well-nigh impos- sible to glean any reliable information. The military seems to go to quite excessive measures to prevent any hope of entry.

All this does not seem to point to a conventional firing range. And we just do not know what happens inside the area, because hardly anyone has been inside. All we know is that there is a large airbase which is not recorded on any map. Some intrepid explorers have risked their lives by photo- graphing it from nearby hills and thus we do have photo- graphic evidence of the airfield’s existence. One theory would have it that the area is a research cen- ter for investigating UFOs and for manufacturing the infa- mous black helicopters. Certainly, UFOs would need to be taken somewhere for investigation, such as in the aftermath of the Roswell incident. Of course, the American govern- ment could also be trying to reproduce the technology gleaned from the alien spacecraft here. Cynics can pour cold water on the case ofUFOs, but the case of black helicopters is indisputable. The American government’s most deadly weapons have, for a long time, been kept secret to hide them from the view of potential enemies. Whatever the reason for the ominous black heli- copters, it is quite clear that the public is deliberately kept in the dark about them. An even more disturbing possibility is that some form of alien life is being kept alive in the area, retrieved from their spacecraft. Who knows what happened to the alien bodies after Roswell? If this is the case, it would seem that the authorities are sitting on a time bomb.

Hundreds ofhelicopters have come screeching down over residential areas, so low that they have rattled the win- dows of buildings not to mention the nerves of the people inside. The police did not seem prepared to offer any reassur- ance at all and simply met inquiries with the response that “operations were being performed.” The lighting condi- tions and tall buildings meant that Charlotte was an ideal location for the exercises to be carried out, unlike Fort Bragg, center ofthe U.S. Army’s Special Operations Com- mand. And the fact that the area was thinly populated and commercial meant that the setting was lifelike, without en- dangering civilians and soldiers. Or so the Army said.

Moreover, he was led to believe that there would be serious consequences if their plans were revealed to the public. Despite this, they let him imagine that their work was completely routine, that they would be in and out and no one would even know they were there.

Police Chief Dennis Nowicki of Charlotte-Mecklenburg was only given warn- ing of the disruptions four hours before the start of the on- slaught, and he was lucky to have been given any warning at all. He said “When you’re holding back information, you’re deceiving.” And according to Malachi Greene, one of the city council members, “The city got hoodooed .... It’s a deliberate thing on the part of these guys.” The Charlotte exercises were only one instance in a reg- ular series of urban combat training exercises conducted by the Special Operations Command. Similar exercises have apparently been carried out in Pittsburgh, where nine helicopters and two hundred troops stormed the areas of McKeesport, the Strip District and Brighton Heights. The harsh criticism from officials in the cities victim to the Army’s exercises has not encouraged any willingness among the Special Operations Command to accept the well- being of local communities as something that needs to be taken into consideration. The military has, by law, the right to conduct training exercises as it sees fit.

He says: “There was no way that there was a genuine study. It was only done for a very short time over a very limited area.

Moni- toring domestic calls is sometimes illegal, but with the (legal) development of microwave transmission, a huge number of long distance phone calls are now recorded. • In April 1995, Great Britain opened the world’s first DNA database. By the year 2000, five million Britons will have their genetic codes in the Home Office master computer. Under the current law, the Home Office has no right to anyone’s genetic code unless they are a con- victed criminal. The world of George Orwell’s 1984 does not seem so far off, however, when the system can be expanded to collect records from citizens who not only haven’t been convicted, but who have had no crim- inal dealings at all. • The United States has the world’s most extensive sys- tem of computer databases of personal information on citizens. The information is collected for purposes rang- ing from monitoring criminals to credit reporting to market research.

A somewhat bizarre incident in Japan, which induced nausea and epileptic-type fits in more than seven hundred children, provoked a wide-scale inquiry into the physical effects that television may have and the motives behind the inducement of these physical reactions. It would appear that these convulsions were caused by a specific episode ofa certain hit animation series, which had reached enormous popularity amongst the Japanese youth. A colorful explosion behind one of the popular characters used strobe lighting which seems to have stimulated nerve cells, causing seizures, breathlessness, impaired vision and nausea. It would seem that strobe lighting produces an effect similar to hypnosis and that this was not the first time that screen addicts have suffered from epilepsy-type seizures.

Necessity in- cluded putting a stop to the suspected barbarism of the Druids and the activities of the Christians. The first Chris- tian persecutions occurred during the reign of the emperor Nero who, after the fire of a.d. 64, declared that Christians were responsible for the arson. Persecutions continued in a fairly half-hearted way until the Trojan Dedius came into power in the third century, when authorities acting under the emperor’s orders began a series ofpersecutions through- out the Empire. The number of persecutions began to in- crease, culminating in the reigns of Diocletian in the East and Maximianus in the West, when an Empire-wide man- hunt for Christian blood began. Although most historians claim that the persecutions were simply due to a misunder- standing of the Christian religion, some researchers have suggested a more practical motive. 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 41"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"42 Conspiracy Theories By the late third century, Rome’s political prowess was under constant threat and, in order to be able to fight the competing nations, it urgently needed to control its increas- ingly unruly inhabitants.

The policy had already been put into action but relied on the cooperation of the slaves who participated in the events. During the third century Roman slaves increas- ingly revolted against their often violent destiny, much to the distress of the emperors, who recognized the public need for mass entertainment and so the Roman populace, now lacking an outlet for its pent-up frustrations, began taking to the streets in acts of violence. As a solution, the Christians, whose population in Rome was enormous, were used as unwitting sacrifices for Roman entertainment. In addition, their being burnt alive served to light Roman streets at night, bringing safety and warmth to the city. Wit- nessing the fate ofthe Roman Christians served its purpose of distracting the citizens and stabilizing the populace of Rome. Thus its continued survival was ensured into the third century.

Prior to his death, accusations of blas- phemy, subversion and homosexuality had destroyed his public image; he was also charged with atheism on the ev- idence of his former roommate and fellow dramatist, Thomas Kyd. As a result of his sacrilegious beliefs, some scholars allege that Marlowe was murdered by Francis Walsingham, a Puritan sympathizer and agent of Elizabeth I. Others accuse royalists, in particular the supporters of the Earl of Essex, of his murder. Significantly, Marlowe’s killer eventually received a pardon from the Queen. In the sixteenth century, the punishment for such crimes as Marlowe was accused of included being boiled alive, burnt at the stake, or hanged, drawn and quartered.

Indeed, the fact that the coroner’s inquest and subse- quent burial of the body—in an unmarked grave—were completed within forty-eight hours of the “killing” gives even more credence to this idea.

This complete transection would cause the ar- tery to retract and close down, enabling the blood to clot. To have died this way Dr. Kelly would have had to lose much more blood than the ambulance team reported. Alexander Allan, the forensic toxicologist at the in- quiry, said that the blood level of the drug’s components was less than a third of what is normal for a fatal overdose. Halpin, Frost and Sennett conclude their letter by stating: “We dispute that Dr. Kelly could have died from haemor- rhage or from Co-Proxamol ingestion or from both.” This theory raises the question of the real cause of Dr. Kelly’s death—and, furthermore, why it is not being made known to the public. Dr. Kelly denied that he could have been the BBC’s main source and the Ministry of Defence claimed that no suggestion was made that Dr. Kelly should lose his job over the issue. However, a friend of Dr. Kelly, British diplomat David Broucher, told the Hutton Inquiry that in an e-mail hours before his disappearance, Dr. Kelly hinted at his crisis with lines such as “many dark actors playing games.” In other conversations, Kelly seemed to predict his own death, saying that he would “probably be found dead in the woods” if the British invasion of Iraq was to go ahead. 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 48"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Diana 1: Dodi T he hysteria has died down.

The HAARP project involves detecting and observing electromagnetic activity, which is the catalyst for seismic activity and move- ment amongst the Earth’s tectonic plates. This technology could be harnessed by the military to trigger earthquakes, eitherdeliberately or by accident.The science behind this is so complex that unless those working on it fully compre- hend it they could create an unexpected disaster. Man can already instigate seismic activity through five known techniques: injecting fluids into the earth at extremely high pressures; extracting fluids already under- ground; mining activity and quarrying; testing nuclear weapons; and constructing artificial barriers like dams and reservoirs. Scientists agree that there have been man-made earthquakes already. In Denver during the 1960s there were several earthquakes of varying intensity which coincided with waste disposal schemes that involved injecting waste deep underground. This high pressure injection of waste triggered the release of stored strain energy in the under- ground rock, causing the destruction of several blocks of suburban Denver. The exploitation of the HAARP technology could prove vital for the Pentagon. In the future if they wanted to create instability in a region, instead ofusing conventional military capability, they could manipulate an area using geophys- ical w eapons.

A system called ECHELON had been developed fol- lowing an agreement known as the UKUSA treaty, signed in 1947, between the governments ofthe United States, the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. This alliance aimed to create a global intelligence net- work with a vast pool ofinformation for analysis by the se- curity services of the treaty’s signatories. Although it is illegal for the British and American security services to spy on their respective citizens and companies, the mem- bers of the alliance managed to neatly sidestep national laws by spying on each other. So, for example, if MI6 wanted to spy on a suspect individual in London, rather than go through the lengthy process of applying for a war- rant, they could simply get their American counterparts to do it for them, and then share the information. The system was designed by America’s National Secu- rity Agency, who have access to all of the information, however, the other members may only view the certain sectors of the collected intelligence relevant to their partic- ular spheres ofinfluence. The centerpiece ofthe whole op- eration is the ECHELON dictionary, a vast resource of keywords, including names, subjects, locations, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses. The millions of daily com- munications around the world are automatically scanned to pick up recognized words, phrases, numbers and ad- dresses.

Operation Foxley, as it is called, has, for the first time, been released to the Public Record Office in Kew, West London.

These propositions ranged from plans for individual attack (for which a potential assassin had even been targeted) to a full-blown SAS bombing on Hitler’s mountain hideaway. Other possible approaches for the action included bringing Rudolph Hess, Hitler’s deputy, to England, hypnotizing him and sending him back to Germany to kill SS chief Heinrich Himmler. Plans started with investigating Hitler’s daily routine down to the smallest possible details, so that the best strat- egy could be planned. Poisoning his tea was one possibility considered, using a chemical called “I” with a delayed ac- tion that would give an attacker the time to flee. Hitler be- ing extremely fond of apple juice, it was also suggested 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 86"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"that “I” could be added to this, as it would not change ei- ther its taste or appearance. It was considered that the best opportunity for attack was mid-afternoon, as Hitler walked to his teahouse in his hideaway in the Bavarian Alps. The assassins would be dis- guised in German military uniforms and would carry high- explosive grenades for self-protection. This would involve getting through a wire fence and avoiding German dog controls. Another possibly less direct method on the part of the SOE was to circulate details of the sexual antics of the top Nazis in an attempt to wreak havoc behind the enemy lines. The theory was that if the concentration camp atroc- ities were not enough to shock the enemy, perhaps more graphically sexual horror stories would galvanize them into some kind of action. Tidbits of gossip were circulated to give the German public the impression that their leaders were involved in ongoing orgies. The Nazi Party chief in Munich, Christian Weber, was attacked particularly fero- ciously here. He was reputed to be famous for parties in which a naked girl would be strapped to a roulette wheel. The wheel was placed on a table and the Nazi officials sat around it. Once the wheel stopped, the gentleman sitting opposite would prove his virility to the assembled com- pany. “A good time was had by all,” apparently, but this view skirts the issue of the girl’s unconsciousness by the end of the session. Some senior figures in the Special Operations Execu- tive, however, believed that Hitler’s capacity for tactical in- eptitude in his war effort meant that he was in fact better alive than he was dead. The danger if he was killed would be that, far from acting as a catalyst to the end of the war, the whole German war strategy would in fact be improved. There was also the danger that once dead the German dic- tator would be worshipped by his public and be canonized into a martyr’s role.

But con- spiracy theorists have prioritized the whole Rabin investi- gation, and the world has started to wonder ifthe suggestion ofa government plot may have a more concrete foundation than mere speculation. Two years after the death of Rabin, Hatzofeh, a right- wing newspaper, published a story highlighting a conspir- acy theory being put forward on the Internet by a man named Uzi Barkan. At the same time, the government re- leased previously unpublished findings of a commission that investigated the assassination. Government officials who have read the report say that the document reveals that an agent of the government security service, Shin Bet, urged the killer to shoot Rabin. Once the document had been released, Netanyahu’s government was demanding further investigations into the parts of the report that were as yet unavailable.

It would seem that Raviv had befriended Yigal Amir this way several years before, and then persuaded him to act as an assassin. He was the power behind the extremist right-wing group, Eyal, which was notorious for attracting political criminals, and it later transpired that he was paid by the government security ser- vice to provoke action amongst ultranationalists. Whether Raviv was or wasn’t behind the crime, the fact that he knew Amir at all is suspicious and the fact that he may have acted as some kind of mentor to him in the past would sug- gest that his action is criminal in that he did nothing to stop Amir’s plans once he was aware of his intentions to assas- sinate Rabin. Investigations into the murder are being hampered by those government officials who claim that the inconsisten- cies surrounding the murder are nothing unusual and that it is almost impossible to find a crime where the facts are all clearly defined and laid-out.

If a conspiracy of such mammoth proportions was being mounted, then hiring such an unprofessional assassin would have been an unusual and unlikely move. Unless, of course, this very unlikeliness was intended to serve as a bluff and cunning cover.

But was the disaster a simple naval accident or was there a more sinister explanation for what happened 60 feet below freez- ing Russian waters? The five-year-old double-hulled Oscar II-class subma- rine was part of a fifty-strong fleet of warships involved in Russian naval exercises off Russia’s northern coastline. But it was two large explosions on board that triggered dis- aster for the crew. The cause of those explosions remains highly contentious, however. Theories include a collision with the seabed, with a British or American submarine straying into Russian territorial waters, an icebreaker or cargo ship, an old World War II mine, or an act of deliber- ate sabotage. It was claimed by Dmytro Korchynskyy, head ofthe nationalist Ukrainian Political Association, that the Kursk was targeted by Chechen separatists.

But it may be that the true cause lies outside ofRussia al- together. Despite the end ofthe Cold War, British and Amer- ican submarines have continued to play cat-and-mouse games with their Russian counterparts under the Atlantic Ocean. Naval crews on rival submarines often shadow each other’s movements in these “games,” but sometimes colli- sions can occur, with eleven occurrences since 1967 in the Barents Sea alone. Anonymous sources from inside the Min- istry ofDefense say that a British submarine may have been involved but even if this were true the British government would never admit to it publicly. Intriguingly, on the day of the disaster the Russian national press agency, Interfax, re- ported that unidentified military sources had said that an object resembling part of a “foreign submarine tower” had been discovered 330 meters from the Kursk on the seabed. The same sources said the most likely explanation for the sinking was collision with another submarine, “most likely British.” However, this was vehemently denied by both the British and Russian defense ministries. Senior Russian naval officers have their own version of what happened. They also believe a collision was the source of the disaster, but with an American submarine. They claim that two American submarines were conducting spy operations, and have produced satellite photographs of an American submarine docked in the Norwegian naval base of Bergen, at a time just after the Kursk sank. The Russian navy insist this proves the submarine had surfaced for repairs resulting from the impact. Submarines are de- signed specifically to spend long periods underwater with- out the need to dock for supplies, proving, as the Russians see it, the case that it had docked for repairs.

The most tantalizing explanation, though, is that one of the torpedoes on board the Kursk dramatically exploded, causing the devastating blast that was detected as far away as Alaska, and measured 4.2 on the Richter scale. Theories abound that a top secret ultra high-speed torpedo named Skhval was being covertly tested, a torpedo said to outper- form any torpedo in the NATO arsenal, claims which would heighten Russian secrecy concerns and for Ameri- can spying operations. Contradictory claims have also emerged with the re- lease of secret British government documents involving a submarine accident off the English coastline in 1955. This involved the use of high test peroxide to supply the tor- pedo’s engine which is thought to have caused an explo- sion. It was this danger which led to the technology being disbanded by the British but, perplexingly, may have con- tinued to be used by Russia and have been the major con- tributor to the Kursk tragedy. The Communist newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda in 2001 suggested a cover-up by the Russian admiralty. It claimed a message was sent from the submarine to land- based commanders before the blast, saying, “We have a malfunctioning torpedo. Request permission to fire it.” By denying this version, the Russian authorities conveniently detach blame from themselves, and from President Vladimir Putin, who was criticized for not cutting short his holiday during the crisis. To add to this sense of connivance, when the Kursk was raised from the seabed the Russian govern- ment said it believed that it was far too dangerous to raise the torpedo compartment with it, which contained live warheads and had to be separated to aid the lifting procedure. This averted any potential criticism ofwhat may have been found in the torpedo chambers, thus saving the reputation of Rus- sia’s embattled armed forces.

The truth seems more than slightly elusive. Questions of whether it really was a suicide are closely tied with the issues of whether his al- legedly estranged wife, Courtney Love, was involved in any conspiracy. The further one delves into the mystery, the fewer ends seem to tie up. What seems strangest of all is the suicide note left by Cobain directly prior to his dramatic exit scene, given that the tone really was not suicidal, with statements such as “I have it good, very good, and I’m grateful.” The entire note was written in the present tense and seems to be a far cry from the final words of a man about to kill himself. According to psychologists at the rehabilitation center Cobain had visited only the week before, as well as close friends, no one had suspected that he was suicidal, which in the light of his Rome “suicide attempt” a few months earlier seems suspicious. Kurt had written Courtney a note after that incident which included one line which she said was “very definitely suicidal.” “Dr. Baker says I would have 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 117"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"118 Conspiracy Theories to choose between life and death,” Kurt had written. “I’m choosing death.” There is the theory that Cobain was quite simply terri- fied for his life after walking out on a $9.5 million contract to headline Lollapalooza and that this inspired him to com- mit suicide. And the fact that the shotgun was loaded with three shells when the fatal deed was done could have been part of a plan to make his suicide look like murder. Strangest of all, police failed to find any fingerprints at all on the gun. Of course, perhaps Kurt had carefully cov- ered his traces and wiped the gun down, but such behavior is not what one expects from someone on the verge of sui- cide, and in any case, if it really was suicide, why the need for the big cover-up? It is not to be denied that murdering the father of your child is fairly uncommon and the fact that Courtney and Kurt were not getting on well before his death would seem little justification for cold-blooded killing. However, she could have had several other possible motives. In January 1994 Cobain told Rolling Stone that he might well be di- vorcing Courtney. Apparently divorce papers had already been drawn up by the time of his death. And shortly before the death itself, Courtney had apparently instructed one of her lawyers to get the “meanest, most vicious divorce lawyer” she could find. Kurt had also hinted that he wanted Courtney taken out of his will, in which case she would have gained a lot more financially from a suicide before the will could be changed than from a divorce. IfKurt were to die, sales for Kurt’s band Nirvana would rocket. And Courtney would benefit financially. The official line is that Kurt committed suicide. In the days and weeks following his death, fans began killing themselves in empathy with their fallen hero. In light of this suicide rush, the backlash would be devastating if po- lice reversed their original judgment and opened a murder investigation. 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 118"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Lennon’s Assassination J ohn Lennon was shot on December 8, 1980 outside the Dakota in New York by Mark David Chapman, aged twenty-five.

It seems quite without doubt that in setting up the CIA, an organization was established comprising en- tirely ofLunarians. Lunarians have infiltrated other sectors of the American government and now hold high positions of state as well as in the army and the navy. Of course, opponents to the theory will point out that man has traveled to the moon and has sent many robot probes to carry out extensive research. But it would have been quite simple for the Lunarians to have intercepted the robot probes and given them false data. And suppose the as- tronauts were brainwashed with the same information that had been fed to the robot probes? The Lunarians would have had plenty of time to see us coming. The moon is plenty big enough to provide temporary hiding places. The big question is what the Lunarians’ next step will be. Once they have infiltrated all the media organizations, world domination will not be far away. Perhaps we should have listened harder to Freud.

On March 10, 1966, three men were convicted of murder in the first degree. One, Talmadge Hayer, a member of the Nation of Islam, confessed he was one of the gunmen, but insisted that the other two, Thomas 15X Johnson and Norman 3X Butler, were innocent. The general feeling was that the Nation was behind the killing because Elijah Muhammad, the Nation’s leader, had made it publicly known that he resented Malcolm’s de- fection from the Nation and feared that he would reveal Nation secrets. One damaging secret was the allegation that the Nation had met with the American Nazi Party and the Ku Klux Klan and accepted money from racist whites—all of whom agreed with the Nation’s policy of racial separation. Another secret was that Elijah Muham- mad had fathered numerous “divine babies” with half a dozen teenaged Nation secretaries. There are other theories about the assassination, too.

Did people from Earth actually travel to the moon? Those who witnessed Neil Armstrong’s landing on the moon wondered at the time if something fishy was going on, if in fact the event ever really hap- pened, if the entire thing was a cover-up presented by NASA, filmed using cinematic tricks. Questions became more pressing with the release of the film Capricorn One, produced by Warner Brothers in 1978, which went so far as to record on screen how some of the effects might have been accomplished. This showed a trip to Mars, cleverly faked so that the public believed what was happening. But people started to wonder whether this was no more than a representation of what had hap- pened with the moon shots of the late ’60s and early ’70s. In reality the possibility of a conspiracy is probably un- likely. In the technological climate as it then was, it would, ironically, have been easier to send a man to the moon and film him there than to attempt to reproduce the moon’s envi- ronment on Earth. Even more modern films like Apollo 13 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 128"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"had considerable difficulties in simulating weightlessness for shots of up to twenty seconds. The lengthy film mate- rial that was returned from the moon cannot easily be ex- plained if it was a fake.

But this does not mean that everything we receive from NASA is exactly as it is portrayed. Even if man did travel to the moon, did they find objects and structures that were never revealed to the public? Did they travel with ulterior motives? These theories are harder to disprove, and to know that we are only receiving information as it is filtered through the NASA censors is disquieting to say the least.

After Earth, Mars is the most habit- able planet in our solar system, and, despite now having freezing temperatures of around minus 50 degrees, re- search has shown that once upon a time, the planet enjoyed a similar climate to our own. Studies suggest that all chances of inhabiting Mars were destroyed by a massive onslaught of comets and/or asteroids. The planet’s surface is covered with craters as a testimony to this. But recently photographs of possible microscopic fos- sils of bacterialike organisms found in Martian meteorites have been unveiled. Life must have, at one time, existed. And, while, at this stage we are not talking about little green men, startling evidence has shown that intelligent life almost definitely set foot on Mars at some stage in the past. Photographs of remarkable pyramid structures have come back from the planet, structures that seem not only to be artificially constructed, but, moreover, bear a similar “face” to that of the Great Sphinx at Giza.

Or else, perhaps even more disturbingly, that an ancient civilization came over from Mars and, in turn, built the pyramids here. Neither can we rule out the possibility that the pyramids were actually created by a civilization whose roots we cannot hope to understand, coming from outside our solar system, a civilization that came into our galaxy and left the pyramids as their trademark. But what could the builders of these mysterious monu- ments have been trying to say? What silent message are we witness to as we regard the vast testimony to a past genera- tion? Are the pyramids merely the proof of a prehistory so ancient that our minds cannot comprehend it, or could they be spelling out some kind of warning? And if they have come from a civilization beyond our own solar system, it is possible that the threat they pose may be imminent. A popular question raised by conspiracy theorists is whether or not investigations on our Earth were carried out in a similar way to our investigations on Mars. In the long term, scientists have plans for a series of experiments whereby, by means ofthe transportation ofsimple bacteria onto Mars, life could be introduced onto the planet. No- body can disprove the theory that life on Earth was started in the same way. A more advanced and older civilization than our own could have deliberately manufactured the way we live. If this was the case, further questions are prompted regarding the Martians’ purpose or fate for us. Are we, for example, the playthings of some mammoth in- tergalactic conspiracy? Theorists also voice concerns that there are a select few here on Earth who know more than they are willing to share.

Suspicions of conspiracy in the as- sassination immediately arose because of the improbable circumstances surrounding Ray. How could a blatantly petty and inexperienced thief (his criminal career was typified by such offences as taxicab holdups and small corner-shop robberies, for which he usually got caught) pull off a com- plicated crime such as a celebrity assassination and make his way to London via Atlanta, Toronto and Portugal? How could he afford the travel expenses, much less plan the convoluted escape in advance? Congressional investigators estimated that Ray spent at least $9,607 between his prison escape and his London arrest, an amount roughly equal to $38,000 by current values. And how could he concoct such an elaborate scheme, yet still be careless enough to leave the murder weapon at the scene of the crime with his fin- gerprint on it? Days before he pleaded guilty, Ray expressed misgiv- ings in a letter to his lawyer, Percy Foreman: “On this 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 136"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"guilty plea, it seems to me that I am taking all the blame, which is all right with me.” In another passage, Ray said, “It was my stupidity which got me into this.” Memphis plastic surgeon Dr. McCarthy DeMere, who served as Ray’s physician at the jail, testified before Congress in 1978 that he once asked Ray. “Did you really do it?” “Well, let’s put it this way: I wasn’t in it by myself,” and that’s all he would say to me,” DeMere testified before Congress in 1978. Ray recounted his guilty plea just days after he entered it, say- ing that he had been talked into committing the crime. He was set up, he said, by a mystery man named “Raoul,” who had recruited Ray into a smuggling enterprise. Early in 1996 a woman named Glenda Grabow came forward saying she had been carrying a secret for years. She knew Raoul. Her claim is detailed in a book by Dr.William F. Pepper, who tracked the man and said the elu- sive Raoul now lives somewhere in the Northeast. But he is originally from Portugal, one of Ray’s destinations on his travels between the assassination and his capture. “Raoul” was a weapons smuggler, said Grabow, and she claims to have seen him off-loading and assembling illegal guns. Ray has said that he ran guns into Canada and Mexico for Raoul.

Usually connected to UFO activity, the MIB seem to have developed a pattern whereby they will appear after any kind of extraterrestrial encounter and ter- rorize those unfortunate enough to have had such an en- counter in the first place. The archetypal Men in Black are given away by the trademark of their black suits, and tend to travel in pairs in black cars, although they have been known to use the infamous black helicopter. Witnesses claim that they often look foreign, are abnormally tall and sometimes have no fingernails. Their spoken English is frequently labored and spoken in an indistinguishable ac- cent, seemingly without having to move their lips. Jenny Randles records in her book Investigating the Truth Behind the MIB multiple cases of MIB activity. The case of Shirley Greenfield, for example, victim of an alien abduction, is explored in the light of the MIB visitation that occurred shortly afterwards. According to Randles, nine days after the abduction two men appeared at the Greenfields’ home demanding to speak to Shirley and threatening to return later if they were denied entrance. 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 138"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"The men apparently held a curious power over the Green- fields and displayed distinctly eccentric behavior. Not ad- dressing each other by name, they simply called each other “Commander” and refused to say where they were from, simply refuting Mr. Greenfield’s assumptions that they were journalists. While they were talking, they appeared to be tape-recording the conversation using a square-shaped box, but one that was totally opaque, with no microphone, and one whose tape did not need to be changed at any point during the proceedings. Randles goes on to show how they grilled Shirley aggressively about her abduction and issued her with a strict warning at the end of the conversation that she must not relay it to anyone. Wheedling everything that had happened out of her, the only thing that Shirley seemed reluctant to tell them was about the physical marks that the abduction had left on her upper arms. However, over the course of the next week, Shirley was plagued by telephone calls from the “Commander,” persistently asking her about physical evidence of what had happened. When Shirley finally confessed that yes, she did have physical marks to prove what had happened, the interrogator seemed relieved and the telephone calls stopped. The big question regarding the MIB is who are they? Are they a part of a government conspiracy to silence the victims of UFO activity? Is there an extra dimension that such activity has unearthed but one that the government is anxious not to reveal? Could this be a manifestation of the government’s conspiracy with an extraterrestrial race, a conspiracy involving human abduction for medical experi- ment in exchange for technological know-how? Or is the mystery of the MIB more frightening still, and could they be from a power or a force of which we are completely un- aware? One thing seems certain: they are prepared to go to any lengths to keep their identity undercover. One can well ask what their motives are in doing this, and it would seem that if there were a logical, rational explanation, it would be out in the open.

Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is 666.

One of these nations—the European Union—is already formed and developing, with a single currency, which re- cently came into play in most ofits participating countries.

Two ofthese inmates, the report went on, may have died as the result of medical treatment. No official inquiries were made. But what was the medical treatment that may have caused their deaths? The Medical Facility suggests that they may well have been the result of mind-control tests. Those subject to the mind-control experiments would of- ten be prisoners for completely random, often petty crimes. They would be given indefinite sentences, freedom being dependent on how well the experiments went. One individ- ual, for example, arrested for joy-riding and given a two year sentence, was subject to experiments and, yielding useful re- sults, was held for eighteen years.

Perhaps it is not altogether surprising that the Depart- ment of Health, Education and Welfare and the U.S. government would rather keep these experiments hushed, especially given their similarity to medical experiments carried out in Nazi concentration camps.

Conspiracy theories were mooted immedi- ately. Questions of who had killed possibly the greatest musician ever to have lived have intrigued historians over the years attempting to unravel the threads of the mystery surrounding such a premature death. One theory is that Antonio Salieri, the long-time arch rival of Mozart, killed him. Indeed, towards the end of his own life, Salieri seems to have lost his reason and at- tempted suicide. From that moment until his own death, rumor had it that he had in fact confessed to the murder of Mozart. However, what could Salieri actually have gained from Mozart’s death? Although Mozart was by far the su- perior composer of the two, in material terms Salieri actu- ally had the better paid job as Imperial Kappellmeister, a post which, no doubt, Mozart would have dearly loved. “ 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 144"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Not only did he have a better salary, but also more oppor- tunities for creativity in terms of having the freedom to compose, and at the time Salieri’s operas had at least as fine a reputation as Mozart’s. Materially, it would seem that Mozart should have had a stronger urge to kill Salieri. As the film Amadeus would have it, Salieri’s wrath against his rival could have been inspired purely out ofjealousy that while he toiled away laboriously to produce his art, which was, in the end, no more than second-rate, Mozart worked apparently effortlessly, achieving what was quite indis- putably the work of genius. Others would point the finger at the Freemasons, with whom Mozart had become involved in his youth. Die Zauberflote is essentially a Masonic opera, and shows the artist’s struggle against Christianity, and in particular the Catholic Church. But at the same time, the Masonic content of the opera is constantly put to question. Mozart did not take Masonic word as law. He came from an un- questionably Christian tradition and moreover, a Christian chorale may be heard in the duet of the armed men in the opera. Sarastro, the archetypal Masonic figure, is not good through and through and appears as a kidnapper. Apparently Mozart had planned to establish a new order, rival to the Freemasons, going by the name of “Die Grotte,” suggest- ing that his relationship with the Masons themselves was not entirely happy. Apparently he had taken his clarinettist friend (and sometime Mason) Anton Stadler into his confi- dence and had consequently been betrayed by him. As a fi- nal possible point of evidence, it would seem strange that the Masons made no financial contribution towards his funeral expenses and were prepared to let Mozart be buried in a pauper’s grave.

Delphi lies on the slopes of Mount Parnassus in Greece, and the town, once called Kastri, used to lie above the ruins of the sacred compound and was relocated in the 1890s when serious excavation began at the ruins. Greek myth has it that Zeus sent out two eagles, one to the east and one to the west, to find the center of the Earth. When they then met at Delphi, this indicated where this central point must be. The “omphalos” is a cone-shaped stone and in previous times stood in front of the Temple to mark the “navel” of the Earth. About 1500 b.c. , Mycenaeans settled there and contin- ued the maintenance of the shrine to Gaea, Mother Earth. The Delphic wise women had already gained fame by then. The shrine prospered until five hundred years later when Apollo came down from the north and killed Python, who had been guarding his mother’s shrine. Apollo claimed the shrine for himself, and, rid of Gaea’s sybils, installed his own oracles. 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 154"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Centuries before the birth of Christ, faithful travelers were making their way to Delphi to ask for advice from the famous Oracle. Cities considered these trips as an absolute priority and gave generously to help with the funding. For more than six centuries, until the shrine was destroyed by the Christian emperor Arcadius in a.d. 398, Delphi was the center of the spiritual world. Yet was this a threat to other religions? In the patriar- chal climate as it then was, could people cope with the idea of the worship of a goddess? Could a goddess be seen to have the capacity to represent all wisdom? The snake was a powerful symbol of the goddess, and for thousands of years it was greatly respected. Eventually, however, suc- ceeding religions used the snake to represent temptation and therefore something inherently evil. The biblical story of the serpent in the Garden of Eden is an obvious exam- ple. Could that story have been written to discourage peo- ple from following the advice of the older religion and its leaders? It is a theory that can never be proven one way or the other, but one that is certainly plausible. The Oracle’s power and influence being what it was, it certainly would have posed a threat to religions to come.

From the Illuminati to the Bilderbergs, se- cret Masonic-style cliques have been rumored to be con- trolling or seeking to control the direction of world events. The Order of Skull and Bones is a secret society based at Yale University in the United States for the males of prominent families. Its most famous former members al- legedly include U.S. President George W. Bush and his fa- ther, former president George H. W. Bush. The group’s activities are not known publicly but rumors abound of clandestine plots to reshape the global order and to influ- ence political figures and institutions. Former members have gone on to become senators, Supreme Court Justices and ambassadors, as well as three becoming president. The famous names who are said to have been through the soci- ety include the Rockefellers, Pillsburys, Tafts and, as pre- viously mentioned, the Bushes. Initially the society was formed to benefit members when they left college, in a similar manner to the Freema- sons. But former Bones members have been accused of 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 156"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"forming a secret government under the guise of intelli- gence operations, sometimes working against the interests of the president and sometimes carrying out operations in his name. Some of the most famous American scandals have the fingerprints of Bones alumni all over them, from the assassination of JFK to Watergate and the Iran-Contra scandal. The person who some claim to have had a hand in all of these events is George H. W. Bush. During the JFK assassination and the Watergate break-in, Bush was work- ing for the CIA, and during Iran-Contra he was vice presi- dent. The influence offormer members ofthis secret society upon American political life takes President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s warnings about the corruption of power within the military-industrial complex to whole new levels. It was Eisenhower himselfwho created this “secret govern- ment” under the guise of intelligence operations, a group that conducts its activities in secret for “national security.” He appointed Gordon Gray the task of hiding these activi- ties. Gray’s son, C. Bowden, was George H. W. Bush’s “soul mate” and “protector of the president, come what may.” His job was to ensure that Bush was not implicated in the group’s activities if any of this became public. Allegations against this secret group include drug trafficking under the veil of the war on drugs, and financing Communism and Hitler’s regime. But one of the most intriguing aspects is that the two major candidates in the 2004 U.S. presidential election, George W. Bush and John Kerry, are both former Bones members. Conspiracies abound that both men are in the pockets ofthe Bones guiding fathers, so that whoever wins will be able to conduct the clandestine policies of the soci- ety for another four years. Furthermore, John Kerry’s wife, Teresa, was previously married to John Heinz, another Yale and Skull and Bones alumni member. Heinz was also an outspoken liberal, often voicing views that were not com- patible with those of the government. More interestingly, he was part of the commission that looked into the Iran- Contra scandal along with John Tower.

Moreover, George Harrison is wear- ing clothes that clearly resemble an undertaker.

Never shy to voice his opinions, the liberal Demo- crat was a well-publicized opponent of George Bush’s war resolution, the only senator, in fact, to vote against it. Investigators concluded that none ofthe typical causes of a small plane accident—engine failure, icing, pilot error— caused the plane to crash. And while weather conditions were less than ideal, with some ice and freezing rain, visi- bility was well above the minimum required, between two and two and a half miles.

Without this attack and without American involvement in Western Europe, the shape of the postwar world may well have been entirely different. But was the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 really a surprise? There is plenty of documented evidence suggesting that President Franklin D. Roosevelt knew about the planned attack and kept it secret to promote his war-time ambitions. Roosevelt was keen to involve America in the war in Western Europe but was restrained by public opin- ion, which ran at 88 percent against joining the Allies. In addition, he had promised during his reelection campaign: “I have said this before, but I shall say it again and again and again: Your boys are not going to be sent into any for- eign wars.” But in private he planned for American troops to go to war to help fight for freedom. In the months and years leading up to the attack Amer- ica had continuously provoked Japan by freezing her as- sets, halting exports, employing an embargo and refusing 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 163"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"access to the Panama Canal for Japanese ships. In his war diary of October 16, 1941, Secretary of War Henry Stim- son wrote: “We face the delicate question ofthe diplomatic fencing to be done so as to be sure Japan is put into the wrong and makes the first bad move—overt move.” A month later he wrote, “The question was how we should maneuver them [the Japanese] into the position of firing the first shot.” In order to prepare for the attack, or more accurately to not prepare for it, the commanders at Pearl Harbor were not made aware of the vital intelligence being gleaned in Washington. Ofmost importance was Washington’s ability to crack Japan’s secret diplomatic code, known as “Pur- ple.” This highly encrypted code was cracked by American signals intelligence in 1940 and was swiftly used to read Japanese diplomatic communications. Copies of this intel- ligence were not passed to commanders at Pearl Harbor, however, despite its obvious vulnerability to attack and complaints from the armed forces based there. An inter- ception made on November 11 warned, “The situation is nearing a climax, and the time is getting short.” Equally, when the Japanese naval fleet approached Hawaii, it has always been claimed that it had complete ra- dio silence, making it undetectable. But the following inter- ception was made from a dispatch from Admiral Yamamoto to the Japanese First Air Fleet on November 26, 1941: “The task force, keeping its movement strictly secret and maintaining close guard against submarines and aircraft, shall advance into Hawaiian waters, and upon the very open- ing of hostilities shall attack the main force of the United States fleet and deal it a mortal blow. The first air raid is planned for the dawn of x-day. Exact date to be given by later order.” These clear warnings were never acted upon by the U.S. Navy, in a chain ofcommand that led ultimately to the president. Despite repeated warnings from Dutch, Ko- rean and British agents about a possible attack, the U.S. gov- ernment showed either incredible ineptitude or deliberately overlooked the threat. 164 Conspiracy Theories 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 164"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Furthermore, all merchant shipping in the Western Pa- cific was halted on the day of the attack, presumably to avoid the Japanese fleet being spotted and the alarm being raised, which would thus ruin FDR’s careful plan.

The Commission that looked into the attacks was com- posed of cronies loyal to Roosevelt, who decided that the attacks were a “dereliction of duty” by the Hawaiian commanders—the same commanders to whom Washington had denied intelligence briefings. With public anger directed toward them and toward Japan, the real culprits were allowed to proceed with their previously unpopular war plan.

At first glance, De Stijl may have appeared to be an artistic movement centered around the creation of art generated for all people regard- less of background and the acceptance of art by the masses, many of whom remained skeptical of modern styles. But behind this seemingly benign and philanthropic concept of art, the painters were actually putting across hidden mes- sages meant to influence the minds of their viewers. Of these painters, Mondrian proved the most subversive and potentially dangerous. Mondrian carefully arranged lines and blocks of colors to produce a style that he felt communicated the most fun- damental and universal elements ofthe visual world. In do- ing so, he created small patterns, barely perceptible to the naked eye, which would play with the audience’s sense of vision. At the intersection of the black lines, gray dots would appear to the viewer. The lines, juxtaposed against a white background and blocks of primary color, gave the paintings a three-dimensional illusion and appeared to move 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 166"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"forwards and backwards in space. In addition, several viewers noticed that the lines would stop just short of the edge of the canvas. It was in these areas of his works that Mondrian placed his hidden messages, directing the viewer towards a sense of peace and harmony. Over time, Mondrian programmed the viewer to accept messages of a new world order, which would promote a peaceful, classless society based on images of harmony and inner contentment. As he grew older, Mondrian in- creased the complexity of his works while holding on to the same fundamental artistic practices. However, some theorists express concerns that Mondrian used his paint- ings to exert a darker influence over the masses his work is aimed at. If this is true, Mondrian may well have harbored aspirations to brainwash an entire society.

The Italians spared no expense in maintaining their cultural prowess and spent enormous amounts of money decorating their churches and cathe- drals, which were often the central points of Italian cities. Pisa was no exception. The city’s power reached its peak directly after the turn of the first millennium, and the citi- zens put all their energies into erecting an intricate display of church buildings, starting with the cathedral and contin- uing with the baptistry. The buildings used the finest mate- rials and craftsmen available and were widely acclaimed for their beauty. But such success, both on the cultural and financial levels, obviously bred a certain amount of resent- ment among Pisa’s enemies, particularly among the Vene- tians who liked to see themselves as the leading forces of Southern Europe. Their jealousy grew and grew so that they started to fab- ricate elaborate plots against the city. During the construc- tion of the Campanile (or bell tower) at Pisa, Venetian vandals weakened the foundation so that after the completion 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 168"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"of a few stories the tower began to tip.

Pope Pius IX, then in power, compensated for his loss of earthly land and power by ordering the Vatican Council to pass the doctrine of unquestionable papal infallibility. Pope Pius XI received the equivalent of£40 million and a restoration of what was, effectively, a spell of power in the Vatican City. Both he and his successors were to exploit and manipulate this arrangement entirely to their own ad- vantage. One means of doing this was in the creation of a Vatican Bank, which was quite beyond the reach of any le- gal organization, secular or sacred. It was thus ideal for evading tax and engaging in underhand financial activities. Under the doctrine established by the Vatican Council I, the Pope’s word, however corrupt, was law and any deviation was false. Once the Vatican Council II was in place, it faced severe opposition from conservatives within the Catholic ranks. As long as the Pope’s word was law, there was no threat to the established order of things. Once free thought 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 170"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"was encouraged, the whole infrastructure of the Vatican was under threat. And once the structure ofthe Vatican was under threat, it was not simply an issue ofdiscussing reforms to the liturgy and the pros and cons of artificial birth control, but far more importantly, the financial advantages enjoyed by the members of the Vatican. The conservatives and reformers reached more and more of an impasse after the death of John XXIII in 1963, and this resulted in the election of Paul VI who agonized over the morality of artificial birth control. The liberalism ofVatican Council II was certainly not welcomed with open arms on a universal level. Old ways were safe and many looked back at the more rigid doctrine of the pre–John XXIII era with nostalgia. Pope John Paul I’s modest and self-effacing demeanor appealed to the conservatives who saw him as a perfect compromise candidate, whom they could effectively con- trol. And yet, once elected, the new Pope began to display a charisma that had been hidden by his former reserve. He devoted himself entirely to revolutionizing the papacy and to returning it to its spiritual origins. He refused to be sucked into the empty ritual of his predecessors and re- fused to follow the scripts prepared for him by the conser- vatives at his press conferences. The conservative factions began to despair, especially after he began to express posi- tive views on contraception. The final straw came when the newly elected Pope started to delve into the Vatican Bank’s dealings. Uncovering a whole network of corruption involving the Mafia, bribery and extortion, John Paul called Cardinal Villott, the leader of the powerful conservative Curia, to his study to discuss certain changes that he intended to put into action. Several people were going to be forced to “re- sign.” Among these were the head of the Vatican Bank and several members of the Curia, including Villott himself. Moreover, Villott was told, the Pope would also call a meeting with an American delegation to discuss a recon- sideration of the Church’s position on birth control.

Returning a while later, she found the Pope sitting in bed with an awful grimace on his face, the papers still in his hand. Beside him lay a bottle ofpills for his blood pres- sure, and vomit covered the sheets. Her first port of call was Villott. Villott did not even check the news but sum- moned the doctor immediately. Having done so, he made haste to the Pope’s rooms and gathered the bottle of pills along with the precious papers. That was the last that was seen of either item. There is still no public death certificate for the Pope. Al- though Italian law requires a period of at least twenty-four hours before a body may be embalmed, Villott made sure that the Pope’s body was embalmed within twelve hours. And while the convention for embalming a body dictates that the blood and internal organs be removed, the Pope’s corpse was left as it was. Hence no one was able to verify whether the body had been poisoned or not. 172 Conspiracy Theories 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 172"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Pope John Paul II O n May 13, 1981 antipapal violence became even more overt as Pope John Paul II was shot and very nearly killed in St. Peter’s Square.

The raised letters in the second parchment spelled out a coherent message: to dagobert ii and to sion belongs this treasure and he is there dead. Although unsure about its meaning, Saunière realized that he had stumbled across something of importance and immediately went to Paris. Saunière spent three weeks there. What happened is unknown, but we do know that he, a provincial country priest, was welcomed into the most distinguished ecclesiastical circles. It was after this trip that the mystery started to thicken. Lincoln shows that, for a start, Saunière’s expenditure seemed to go far beyond his means. By the end of his life in 1917, it is calculated that he had spent millions of francs, often in seemingly bizarre ways. The church was redecorated, but redecorated in the most unconventional way, so that above the doorway, a Latin inscription bore the message: terribilis est locus iste (this place is terri- ble) and the garish frescoes on the church walls all seemed to deviate from biblical teaching. In the Ninth Station of the Cross, for example, which shows Jesus’ body being carried into the tomb, there is a background ofa full moon. What message was being put across here? The Bible would have it that Jesus’burial occurred during the afternoon, so is this simply an interpretation that the burial actually hap- pened at nightfall? Or is it a representation of the body be- ing carried into the tomb at all? Could it be in fact the depiction of Jesus being carried out of rather than into the tomb? Saunière’s life became more and more mysterious. His entry into the upper ranks of Parisian society seemed in- congruous to say the least, but this did not pose as many questions as the Church’s intense interest in his findings, or his subsequent exemption from the Vatican. Rumor has it that on being called to give last rites to Saunière, the neigh- boring parish priest fled from Saunière’s sickroom, visibly distraught, and refused to perform the ceremony. Accord- ing to one witness he never smiled again. And why should 182 Conspiracy Theories 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 182"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"his housekeeper, Marie Denarnaud, who became his life- time companion, have referred to a “secret” that would give her not only wealth but also power? It could have been that Saunière had stumbled across a huge sum of money somewhere in the proceedings. But Henry Lincoln explores the possibility that he had come across something far more explosive, indeed dangerous. Could it be that he had come across knowledge that would affect the entire Western vision and history? Could his money have been part of a vast ecclesiastical blackmail? Or even a payment for silence? Whatever the answer, the Vatican appeared to be afraid of him throughout his life- time, and waited on his every command. Whether he was blackmailing them we do not know, but he did appear to have an influence that extended far beyond the provincial backwater ofRennes-le-Château. On his deathbed he passed the secret to his housekeeper. She took the secret to her grave. The mystery continues.

His hy- pothesis revolves around the fact that Jesus was in fact married. There is no explicit statement in the Gospels to support this, but ifhe was claiming the status ofRabbi, this would almost be a prerequisite. Jewish law stated quite cat- egorically that an unmarried man may not be a teacher. Moreover, the account ofthe Wedding ofCana raises ques- tions as to whether this ceremony was in fact Jesus’ own wedding. The presence of Mary, the mother of Jesus, for a start. And the repeated references to the bridegroom ad- dressed to Jesus. One could conclude that Jesus and the bridegroom are the same person. Lincoln goes on to show how ifhe was married, biblical evidence would seem either to point to Mary Magdalene, whose role throughout the Gospels seems deliberately am- biguous, or to Mary of Bethany as being his wife. There is also the suggestion that the two Marys were actually the 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 184"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"same person. As Lincoln points out, the medieval Church and popular tradition definitely regarded them as such. One woman, recurring throughout the Gospels under dif- ferent names and performing different roles, could have been the wife of Jesus. And if Jesus was married, could this have been a mar- riage to establish a dynasty, a dynasty that would have threatened the entire Roman order? The question of whether Jesus did father children is, again, far from explicit in the Gospels, but, following Lin- coln’s argument, one can question the status of Barrabus. If Jesus had had a son, it is indeed likely that he would be called “Jesus bar Rabbi,” “Jesus, son of the Rabbi.” Alter- natively, “Jesus bar Abba,” “Jesus the son of the father” might again refer to Jesus’son, ifhe were indeed the Heav- enly Father. And the whole issue of the Crucifixion is again fraught with ambiguity, as Lincoln shows. Crucifixion was a Ro- man practice and was reserved exclusively for those who had committed crimes against the empire. This would sug- gest that he must have done something to provoke the wrath of the Roman empire, rather than the Jewish law. Moreover, victims of crucifixion usually took over a week to die, and yet Jesus’death seems to have been well-timed to fit in with Old Testament prophecy. And according to Roman law, a crucified man was denied burial and simply left on the cross to rot. If Jesus did not die on the cross, what happened to him and where did he go? Did the resurrection ever actually take place, or was this all part of the grand escape on the part of Jesus? According to certain Eastern legends, he lived until he was well into his seventies, and, Lincoln ar- gues, the documents found by Saunière at Rennes-le- Château contained “incontrovertible proof that Jesus was still alive in a.d. 45. And quite apart from what happened to him, what happened to his family? Ifhe was indeed mar- ried with children, escape would have been as imperative for them as it was for him. Lincoln goes on to ask whether Rennes-Le-Ch â teau 2: The Church 185 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 185"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"they could have escaped into the South of France. Could Jesus’ mummified body even be somewhere near Rennes- le-Château? And could they have brought the dynasty of Jesus into France? Was Jesus’familial descendency in fact no more miraculous than any of the rest of us? Obviously, one cannot point at any one individual as a direct descen- dent of Jesus, but if this is the case, it would seem that the entire values and thinking of the Western world would be severely challenged. Saunière’s secret was well-kept. But did he unearth a huge cover-up on the part of the Church, obscured by leg- end, and lost in time? One can see why the Church at the end of the nineteenth century was so anxious that he should not speak out. 186 Conspiracy Theories 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 186"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Robert Maxwell T he web of intrigue that surrounded Robert Maxwell throughout his life only began to unravel after his death in November 1991. While soaking up the sun aboard his yacht in the Canary Islands, he mysteriously vanished overboard, just as revelations about his dubious financial dealings began to emerge. The former Mirror Group chair- man and pension thief was allegedly involved in a $40 bil- lion money-laundering operation with the Russian Mafia and a group of Chinese Triads. He was also close to con- spirators in the coup against Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991, and was on the periphery of the Iran- Contra affair. At the same time, he moved with ease among the world’s powerbrokers and had access to the most secre- tive places in the world, including the Oval Office and the Kremlin. Given his controversial and dangerous back- ground, it is hardly surprising that his death, to this day, is shrouded in mystery. Numerous conspiracy theories exist about Maxwell’s “assassination,” many of which tend to mix the fanciful with the factual. The most popular school ofthought claims that he died due to his close association with Mossad, the 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 187"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Israeli Secret Service. It is alleged that Mossad agents chose to eliminate Maxwell because he was threatening to expose Israeli state secrets. Indeed, the death has all the hallmarks of a Mossad operation. According to supporters of the Mossad theory, Israeli agents boarded Maxwell’s yacht, the Lady Ghislaine, under the cover of darkness and plunged a needle filled with a lethal nerve serum into his neck. They then lowered his body into the sea to make his death seem like a suicide. As well as working for Israel, Maxwell was a conduit for the Communist Secret Services, setting up countless compa- nies on behalfofformer members ofthe KGB, East German Stasi and Bulgarian government. It is also suspected that Eastern European crime bosses and governments swallowed up billions of Maxwell’s laundered money after his death. Such information only fuels speculation that Maxwell’s death was not a suicide but the clinical work of assassins. 188 Conspiracy Theories 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 188"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Roswell W hat really happened at Roswell? No other UFO in- cident has attracted as much attention as the event here in 1947. The proponents’case is that at least one, pos- sibly two, flying saucers crashed in New Mexico during July of that year and that a rancher named Mac Brazel found some of the debris from the crash. The alien wreck- age and the bodies of its inhabitants were retrieved imme- diately and taken away for further investigation. No one knows what happened to them, but no one seemed very keen to divulge any information, suggesting that whatever had been discovered was quite possibly of enormous dan- ger to our civilization. The whole case lay forgotten until 1978 when Stanton Friedman and William L. Moore rediscovered the Roswell reports and pieced together irrefutable evidence that Brazel had indeed found parts ofan alien spacecraft. They worked out a flight path for the UFO: that it came from somewhere southeast of Roswell, suffered some kind of damage or ac- cident over Brazel’s ranch where it shed some debris, then veered west to crash in the desert in the region of St. Agustin. It was made very clear to them, however, that the 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 189"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"U.S. authorities would be no more forthcoming than they had been thirty years earlier.

Then, says The Roswell Incident (Friedmann and Moore, 1980), it came out with this curt message: attention albuquerque: do not transmit. repeat do not transmit this message. stop communication immediately. The sender was not identified. Someone does not want the truth of the incident to be revealed. And so, we can ask, was the crashed object really an alien craft? Or could there be a very dark and dreadful secret behind what really went on? Of course, the object could have been a balloon, either a weather balloon or the test launch of a balloon in the top se- cret Project Mogul. According to surviving project members of Mogul, a large number of these balloons could certainly have crashed onto Brazel’s ranch, and their remains would fit his description of what he found. Mogul’s classified pur- pose was to try and develop a way to monitor possible Soviet nuclear waves, and no other means of investigating the nu- clear activities of a closed country like the USSR was yet available. The project was given a high priority. And yet the whole Roswell mystery could be no more than a military failure to tell a balloon from an alien flying saucer. However, there are more unnerving possibilities. Sup- pose the balloon was the top-secret device that was going to win the Cold War for the U.S. Suppose it crashed on its first flight, and suppose a serious investigation would reveal that it was hopeless with no future and only went ahead because of a network of corrupt government con- tracts and dealings. Or suppose that there is a still more murky Roswell secret, such as a tethered balloon carrying a nuclear device designed to explode at high altitude.

This would be the kind of event that people would go to any length to hide, even by creating elaborate UFO contact stories once the investigations started. In 1948, the year after the Roswell incident, Newman, a British writer, produced a book whose theme was uncom- fortably close to the events of the year before. It told of a faked UFO crash by leading world scientists whose aim it was to force world disarmament. Some believe Newman alluded to the events of the previous year, and if so, this would suggest that what happened at Roswell may have carried a political agenda—or even that the incident was spelling out some kind of warning.

A book published in the United States in 2002 claims that “for sixty years an unprece- dented conspiracy has existed at the highest levels of the British Establishment to prevent the truth about Rudolf Hess and his fateful flight to Scotland in May 1941 from surfacing into the public domain.” Hess was the Deputy Führer and first in line to succeed Adolf Hitler. In 1941 he flew to Britain, unarmed, and landed in Scotland, where he was promptly arrested. He has popularly been portrayed as a lunatic on a one-man mission. The book alleges that he actually arrived in Scot- land with the full knowledge and support of Hitler, acting as his personal envoy. It is argued that he was to meet a member of the royal family to organize a peace treaty be- tween Britain and Germany. Hitler was thought to want to avoid conflict with Britain if he could because he under- stood how difficult it would be to conquer the island, with simultaneous Eastern and Western fronts an enormous drain 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:00 AM Page 192"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"on his military machine, settling for continental Europe as the limit of his imperialist ambitions. When Winston Churchill got wind of this plan, how- ever, he was determined to prevent its success. Churchill had been an impassioned critic of Hitler, and his disgust of the German appeasers within Britain had instilled a bel- ligerent streak within him towards Nazi Germany, which he viewed as a scourge on the face of Europe he was deter- mined to defeat. He instructed the army to imprison Hess as soon as he arrived on British soil. In a further twist, it is claimed that Hess used an anony- mous double. Whilst the fake Hess was kept in a Welsh prison, the real one was still in Scotland. This prevented any rescue attempts on him by German special forces. In an attempt to undermine Churchill, the Duke of Kent— part ofthe establishment keen on a peace deal with Hitler— flew to Iceland for a break. On his journey he stopped off in Scotland to collect the real Hess and take him to Sweden to initiate a peace plan. Intriguingly, the plane crashed on leaving Scotland and those on board were killed instantly. The motive for those in the aristocracy was simple. They viewed the Nazi threat as being much less important than the threat from the Soviet Union. They thought that ifthey could enable Hitler to concentrate all his efforts on the Eastern Front he would have greater success in defeating Stalin’s empire. This would leave both the Soviets and the Germans severely weakened, with a power and territorial vacuum in Western Europe ready to be exploited by the British. With the Duke of Kent’s plan foiled, it was simply left for the fake Hess to take the stand at the Nuremberg trials, where Hermann Goering claimed: “Hess? Which Hess? The Hess you have here? Our Hess? Your Hess?” Despite this, the government and establishment of the time man- aged to conceal this elaborate plan and counter-plan amidst the euphoria of the Allies’ war victory, when people pre- ferred to look forward towards a more optimistic future.

For two decades, the disappearance of the celebrated Derby winner has been shrouded in a fog of mystery and conspir- acy theories. On February 8, 1983, armed men burst into Shergar’s stable in Ballymany, County Kildare, and forced head groom Jim Fitzgerald to load the horse onto a vehicle, which was then towed away. Shergar was never seen again. Days later, Fitzgerald received an anonymous ransom de- mand of £2 million for the safe return of the champion wonder horse. But Shergar’s primary owner, the Aga Khan, refused to give in for fear of setting a precedent in the sport. Shergar’s vet, Stan Cosgrove, believes the kidnap- pers made the mistake ofthinking that the Aga Khan was the sole owner of the horse and would be only too willing to part with his millions.

But whether the incident was a mere accident or the result of something far more disquieting, there were plenty of coin- cidences involved for cynics to create a circumstantial case for the latter.

One of the six crewmembers on board was Colonel Ilan Ra- mon, Israel’s first-ever astronaut. Ramon was a former Is- raeli Air Force pilot, who participated in the bombing of Iraq’s Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981. The crash took place against the backdrop of the military build-up of U.S. and coalition forces in anticipation ofthe Iraq War and increas- ing hostility in the Middle East to the United States and the 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:01 AM Page 204"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"enemies of the Arab world, primarily Israel. With fierce Arab condemnation of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and as they see it the persecution of the Palestinian people, the irony of the crash location, Palestine, Texas, seems too much of a coincidence for some. For those who like to create or uncover anti-Zionist conspiracies, these facts seem to point to only one thing: divine intervention. Palestinian terrorist organizations de- scribed it as “punishment from Allah.” Many of those who believe in a connection are active Holocaust-deniers, and they seized on the fact that Colonel Ramon’s parents were both Holocaust survivors and that Ramon took aboard with him Holocaust-related items and literature. Others point to the U.S. government and believe it is a self-inflicted disaster, a “textbook psychological warfare operation” designed to create public anger against Iraq and the wider Arab world to prepare people psychologically to support the Iraq War. Even without explicit confirmation from the government, the tacit link would be enough to in- crease support for a controversial conflict. A similar plan to this, entitled the “Northwoods” plan, was developed in the 1960s. It was drawn up by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and aimed to blame Cuba if anything went wrong during the mission to launch John Glenn as the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. Apocryphal stories also emerged suggesting Colonel Ramon was conducting secret experiments on the shuttle mission on behalf of Israel’s Institute of Biological Re- search, looking at ways of combating Saddam Hussein’s potential weapons of mass destruction threat. It was al- leged Ramon was using covert cameras to survey desert dust and wind-drifts emanating from Iraq’s deserts, pro- viding intelligence that would assist in repelling possible future attacks; but the likelihood of this seems remote.

Recent evidence suggests that the Egyptian Pharaohs, scheming to create a lasting and powerful display of Egypt- ian ingenuity, created the structures for the express purpose ofconfusing future civilizations as to just exactly how they were built. With theories of vast slave pools, unknown an- cient technology and even alien assistance, the mystery of Egypt and the mystery of the pyramids will likely live on far into human history. However, startling new evidence has suggested that perhaps the monuments were not built by the Egyptians at all. The Great Sphinx of Giza is one of the world’s oldest mysteries. It is probably the greatest relic of a distant past, but one that asks more questions than it answers and one 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:01 AM Page 208"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"that could potentially reveal information that could throw new light on our entire civilization. The Sphinx is not built out ofquarried rock like the pyr- amids and temples that it guards, but rather out of the un- broken foundation. It has a man’s (or arguably a woman’s) head and the body ofa lion. It is 66 feet high, 240 feet long and has the most extraordinary expression looking out of this world into infinity. Most Egyptologists, and most Egyptians for that matter, believe that the Sphinx was built in around 2500 b.c. in the time of the pharaoh Chephren (or Khafre), who is identified with the Second Pyramid at Giza. Yet recent research has shown that this theory is little more than legend, but a theory that is well worth upholding on the Egyptians’part, for the monumental edifice has be- come a symbol of their kingdom. John A. West had visited the statue many times, and it had always seemed to him to be something apart, some- thing far older than known civilization. Reading a book on Egypt by the French author and mathematician Schwaller de Lubicz, he came across the theory that there were signs of water erosion on the body of the Sphinx. West realized that the weathering patterns on the Sphinx were not hori- zontal as seen on other monuments at Giza, but vertical. Horizontal weathering is the result of prolonged exposure to strong winds and sandstorms. There have been plenty of these in the arid area of the Sahara, but could water have caused the vertical weathering on the Sphinx? Water from where? In 1991 Dr. Robert Schoch, a prominent geologist and professor from Boston University, examined the weather- ing on the Sphinx and concluded that the patterns must have been caused by torrential rain, concluding that the Sphinx must have been built in an era when such rains were common in this area, and that the other monuments must have come many years later. This would suggest that the Sphinx was built before the most ancient of Egyptians, before the very first dynasties thousands of years before Sphinx and the Great Pyramids 209 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:01 AM Page 209"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Christ, before, in fact, recorded history. And this unravels quite staggering possibilities. The Sphinx is quite possibly the most remarkable mon- ument in the world. It is quite unlike anything either the ancient Egyptians or even our modern culture could build. It seems to belong to an ancient culture, and one which must have had far greater knowledge than ours. Its face is surprisingly modern and its expression is one of such wis- dom and profundity that it suggests a knowledge far be- yond our puny mortal efforts. We can only surmise at what secret the Sphinx guards, but whatever it is, the Egyptians do not want it revealed. The pharaonic head of the Sphinx is out of proportion with the body. Could it have originally been a leonine head, carved twelve thousand years ago to mark the Age of Leo, which was then rediscovered just four thousand years ago by the Egyptians and recarved at that point in honor of their pharaoh? A series of surveys have also indicated the existence of several tunnels under the Great Sphinx itself, leading to an unexplored chamber about twenty-five feet beneath the great paws of the statue. We can only surmise as to what the contents of this chamber might be, but the possibilities are endless. The remnants of an ancient civilization could be stored here. And if this ancient civilization was capable of building the Sphinx, revelation of its other capabilities could be extremely enlightening. Perhaps therein lies the riddle of the Sphinx.

A series of experiments in California attempted to research something of this intelli- gence. The first experiment placed a nut in the same posi- tion over a number of days, testing the squirrel’s spatial memory. The second experiment, however, was more com- plicated, changing the route to the nut so that the squirrel had alternative routes. And the squirrels demonstrated that they were not relying on merely retracing their steps.

He thus had to be removed from the political scene. Stalin arranged for Kirov’s mur- der and placed the blame on the Zinoviev faction. Stalin was a cunning conspirator and foresaw the wave of official adulation for Kirov. Robert Tucker writes in Stalin in Power that “The instant Kirov cult was blended into the Stalin cult, which took on an added lustre, Kirov became ‘Comrade Stalin’s best comrade-in-arms and friend.’Stalin was shown in the honor guard with Kirov in old photos and as the first mourner at the Red Square funeral.” But this single murder was part of a much larger con- spiracy whose aims were far broader than the removal of a single political competitor. Tucker writes: “For the con- spirator from above, the prime purpose of Kirov’s murder was to make possible an official finding that Soviet Russia was beset by a conspiracy that had done away with Kirov as part of a much larger plan of terrorist action against the regime.” In this way, Stalin had the excuse to begin the Great Purge, which claimed millions of innocent lives. 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:01 AM Page 213"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Even before the murder, Stalin had decreed a statute al- lowing the newly created Special Board to have the final word on “persons deemed socially dangerous.” This al- lowed for the loosest ofinterpretations of“socially danger- ous,” which could be taken as anything that went against the will of Stalin. Just as Hitler was quite prepared to per- suade the public that his mass genocide was for their own good, so Stalin had no qualms in making out that his pro- gram was one of social awareness and justice. 214 Conspiracy Theories 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:01 AM Page 214"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Stargate T he civilization of ancient Egypt has provided inter- est and intrigue across the world for centuries, but it has also generated enormous fascination with conspiracy theorists.

Many books have been written about the origins of these structures in recent years, some involving extrater- restrials and visitors from other dimensions. Popular the- ories suggest that the Egyptian civilization was created or assisted by superior technology from outer space. But one of the most interesting theories currently put forward contradicts all of these and believes the explanation is to be found here on Earth. The Stargate Conspiracy by Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince claims that conspiracy theories about a mythical Stargate are all part of a greater but less documented conspiracy themselves.

Which authors are involved in promulgating this idea is not entirely clear, but as these beliefs have reached the public domain, those with fanciful minds have unwittingly helped to spread the idea further, lending it unwarranted credibility. These ideas are not new. In his book The Controllers: A New Hypothesis of Alien Abduction, Martin Cannon discusses his belief that reported alien abductions are in fact planned kidnappings by the security services, includ- ing MI6, the CIA and the National Security Agency in the United States. These people are then used for experi- ments in mind control and other clandestine technologies. When these incidents of abduction are reported they are never taken seriously by the mainstream media. Those making the claims are simply brushed aside or consid- ered lunatics. There is a long history of the intelligence services and the military divulging false information concerning extra- terrestrials to preserve the fascination for aliens among the general public. Anonymous tip-offs concerning the activi- ties at Area 51 have been given to journalists to create a fabricated frenzy. It always suits agencies like the CIA to create a culture ofdependency among citizens, enabling the government to press ahead with its own autocratic agenda unhindered.

Whenever conspiracy theories are discussed they are often linked to political events, whether by partisan trou- blemakers or well-intentioned truth-seekers. George W. Bush and his party were accused of using subliminal mes- sages during his 2000 election campaign in Florida. In a Republican ad criticizing Democratic candidate Al Gore’s prescription drug proposal the word “rats” appears briefly on screen over the words “The Gore Prescription Plan.” The letters then form part of the next message, which is “Bureaucrats decide.” Owing to the extremely fractious nature of the 2000 election race, and the events in Florida especially, accusing fingers were pointed towards the Bush campaign team.

The topic of subliminal advertising is a contentious one. Arguments rage among academics about whether it even exists. Subliminal messages often focus on society’s taboos. According to Dr. Wilson Bryan Key, topics such as sex, death, incest, homosexuality and pagan symbols are all used by advertising companies to get a secret message into a viewer’s mind without them realizing it consciously. The advertising agencies claim that any hidden symbols are pure coincidence, by mistake, or the result of individ- ual artists going beyond their remit. In his research, how- ever, Key says advertising agencies spend thousands of dollars and hundreds ofdesign hours making sure their ads are pitched perfectly to their intended target, right down to using death symbols, screaming faces, images of animals and of sexual gratification. With no laws to prevent this kind of activity, there is lit- tle to stop advertising agencies resorting to the use of sub- liminal messages. It is very disturbing indeed to consider the power advertisers have to conspire to change society’s behavior in ways we wouldn’t even be aware of.

In 1932 Franklin Roosevelt won over Herbert Hoover in the presidential elections and embarked on the huge social reform intended to repair the nation.

We know that the large sheet bearing the imprint of a man is at least several hundred years old and may be as old as two thousand.

It bears marks along the forehead, which one could presume came from the crown of thorns, flogging wounds and even a cut to the right of his chest.

One theory goes that Leonardo da Vinci had the technological knowledge to create a photographic image, and that in fact the image of the shroud is a photographic self-portrait of Leonardo himself.

However, arguments against this would say that the paint could have rubbed off the paintings that the shroud covered in attempts to sanctify them.

One piece of evidence pointing to a forgery is that the nail wounds are in the palms ofthe hands, as was tradition- ally believed to be the case with Jesus. Historical evidence ofcrucifixions points to this being a physical impossibility, however: a nail through the palm could not support the body’s weight—it would tear through the bones and mus- cles. Crucifixion was only possible by placing the nail through the wrist, which had a strong enough bone struc ture. If Jesus’ shroud is a fabrication, then it followed tradition rather than scientific fact. While it may be a clever fake, the origins of the shroud are ambiguous. Because even if it had been fabricated in the Middle Ages as the ultimate relic, the precision of the image is astounding. And this cannot explain away the blood stains. One theory would have it that the shroud is not only what it claims to be but that it is more than this in being none other than The Holy Grail of myth. Another theorist puts forward the view that the imprint ofthe man is not actually Jesus but one of the Knights Templar, one of the legendary guardians of the Grail.

Moreover, William Cooper, an alleged former intelligence officer in the U.S. government, has claimed that if the secret should get out, MJ-12 has a plan to round up all sorts ofpeople and send them offto concentration camps. Appar- ently this was the real reason behind the JFK assassination, as Kennedy had apparently known about the conspiracy and was about to make an announcement to the nation. 2. Illuminati. The whole institution of the Illuminati is sur- rounded in mystery, not least of all because no one really knows what it is made up of. We do know that there are many different Illuminati groups, all with different kinds of secret knowledge, which take over all kinds oforganizations ranging from top chain supermarkets to radio and television broadcasting agencies to Mrs. Boggins’tea shop round the corner. For the last several hun- dred years, they have been condemned by governments and reli- gions as being linked to conspiracies for a one-world government. The plan for worldwide control was formulated over two hundred years ago by a group of leading European bankers made up of a dozen or so rich families, led by money lenders and industrialists. It was initiated in Bavaria by a professor Who Will Take Over the World? 237 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:01 AM Page 237"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"named Adam Weishaupt. His theories revolved around the ideal of utopic democracy which, he felt, could only be achieved by means of a one-world government. The conspiracy has infil- trated much of the history of the Western world, and includes the Bilderbergers, the Club of Rome, the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. The Illuminati have always been closely linked to the Freemasons and, indeed, the start of the cult involved domination of the upper ranks of Con- tinental Freemasonry. The Illuminati still attempt to recruit students with exceptional mental ability coming from affluent backgrounds. They then con- vince them that men of above-average intelligence have the right to rule the world simply because the masses do not know what is good for them, physically, economically or spiritually. Their aims, however, are no longer quite so philanthropic. Mrs. Boggins’ tea shop down the road may look innocuous enough, but remember that she could be one of THEM. Their su- perior technological knowhow means that they have more than enough expertise to carry out their projects for absolute domina- tion. Their primary aims are the complete extinction of indepen- dence and the establishment of mindless obedience to the party line. To keep themselves amused, they commit petty crimes (just think what could have gone into Mrs. Boggins’tea which she sets before you) to cause as much confusion as possible. Their plan is for a one-world government to be made up of a key dictator with his government of a few billionaires, Commu- nists and scientists who have shown loyalty to the cause. The rest of us are to be completely enslaved to this elite. 3. Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein has been quite pos- sibly the most dangerous threat to the planet’s stability and safety since Hitler. Allied bombings of Baghdad were not enough to si- lence him and conflict continued, eventually culminating in a sec- ond war in the Gulf. It was clear that this tyrannical leader, who has imposed a reign of terror on his subjects and has been an ongoing threat to the rest ofthe world, needed to be stopped. Rumors ofconspiracy plots have been in the air ever since the troubles began, and, it is 238 Conspiracy Theories 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:01 AM Page 238"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"hinted, weapons have been developed and perfected so that a sin- gle shot can now be fired accurately from several miles away. But Saddam—who was supposedly captured in December 2003—is no fool. He is quite aware that he is unpopular, and he has always been aware of the threat to his personal safety. So he would go nowhere without a bodyguard. He had servants to taste his food. He mastered the art of self-defense in all walks of life; and this includes having a series of doubles. Some might even call them clones. Saddam’s clones serve their purpose, and the implications of having them are potentially quite enormous. The obvious ques- tion is: Is it really Saddam Hussein being held in coalition cus- tody? If Saddam Hussein is actually a committee, it is of little consequence whether the original one is captured or free, alive or dead.

Babylon developed into one of these cities, reaching its economic and cultural peak under Nebuchadnezzar, the famous conqueror of Judea in the Bible. Early in its history, however, Babylon was but one of a multitude of small towns whose very upkeep was threat- ened by constant invasions. Wellawareoftheirsituation,theleadersofthecitycame up with a brilliant idea to elevate Babylon to power. Realiz- ing that sex would probably attract and sell better and faster than any politics or religion, and probably on a much more long-term basis, they established the legend of the Whore ofBabylon, a mythical figure who would come to represent the royally encouraged enterprise ofprostitution. Babylon’s king and leaders actively encouraged the spread of myths telling of orgies and debauchery on a mammoth level. Soon, Babylon’s reputation as a city of pleasure spread far and wide as men seeking instant gratifi- cation and fulfillment came to the city in hordes, which subsequently resulted in increased tourism and commerce. 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:01 AM Page 240"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"This newly discovered wealth enabled the city to grow and prosper. Even as late as the fourth century b.c. , Alexander the Great, attracted to the temptations of the city, camped his army within the walls of Babylon to spend the winter.

The fate of the poor aforementioned animal seemed to be set in stone when he finally passed away after years of faithful service to the zoo. Distress failed to describe the emotions of the children who had traveled from all corners of the country to see poor old Zack. And so, decided the authorities, action had to be taken. The expressions on the faces of the hordes of distraught children who had rushed so expectantly to Zack’s cage was just too much to bear. An artful disguise was undertaken. A horse was imported from the adjoining cage and was painted black and white. And no one noticed. The delight of the children knew no bounds. Zack was back. This project was not without its complications, however— not least of all that Zack had to be repainted every week, and every two hours if it rained. But this seems of little consequence, seeing as rumor was threatening closure of the zoo. And if it took standing in the rain painting a horse black and white to avoid redundancy, the zoo workers were quite happy to undertake the task. 26446_ch01.qxd 6/27/05 11:01 AM Page 242"}]
