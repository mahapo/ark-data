[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"PREFACE Mayer Amschel Rothschild, the founder of the Rothschild fortune, at the time of his death in 1812, cr eated a trust of his estate, by will, for the elevation of the Jewish race and the estab- lishment of a Jewish World Empi re. The cardinal principles of the trust were secrecy, that the es tate should be ke pt intact as a unit, that the heirs and their heirs should have only a communal interest in it, and that the estate as a whole shou ld be governed by the eldest son of the eldest so n unless a majority of the heirs determined otherwise. The estate has been preserve d and managed since his death as a unit in pursuance of the pr ovisions of his will. There are now several hundred heir s, for the family is a prolific one, but the estate is communal and still under the mana gement of one head. So far as known, the provis ions of the wills of the mem- bers of the family still contain in substance the directions of the founder of the fortune. History affords but meager info rmation regarding the rulers of this fortune and th e extent of it, becaus e of their secretive methods. No inventory has ever been filed and no division has ever been sough t by any heir. Most of the histories of the Rothschild family are either Jewish or strongly pro-Jewis h. While they are extravagant in praise of the virtues of the different members of the Roths- child family, they are rather meag er in facts. The facts herein related have been gleaned from many sources and are based on information believed to be reliable. We do not know the ex tent of the founder 's fortune at the time of his death in 1812, nor do we know the present magnitude of it, but apparently it represen ts about one-half of the wealth of the world. This huge fortune has been devoted with great shrewdness and energy to the purpose of ex ploiting the Gentiles in all the countries of the globe. The me thods employed are the manipu- lation of currencies, speculatio ns on the excha nges, and wars. The Rothschilds by these operations profit enormously because they have the power by virtue of their immense wealth and po- "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"litical power, to put prices up or down at pleasure. It is for these reasons that we have had most of our wars and depressions. The protocols and th e communists code, which are identi- cal in purpose a nd intent, represent their plan for the conquest of the world. Both of these code s were published subsequent to Mayer Amschel's death, but some of the protocols appear to have been in existe nce prior thereto. Th ey, however, represent his principles as shown by all that we know of him. This book is not written in a spirit of anti-Semitism, for I have Jewish friends th at I do not wish to injure. It is written in the hope that it may be helpful in solving our Jewish prob- lem peaceably and by appropriate legislation. To the extent that the remedies herein suggested ma y contribute to that end they will be helpful to the Jews as well as to the balance of us, for it is certain that the people of this country will never meekly sub- mit to slavery. In writing and publishing this book I am inspired by no other motive than to render a serv ice to my country. I realize that I am taking some risk in doing so—at least th at of perse- cution.

The Protocols \"For ages past the sons of Israel, despised and persecuted, have been working to open up a path to power. They are hit- ting the mark. They control the economic life of the accursed Christians; their influence preponderates over politicians and over manners.\"-—From \"Funeral Oration of Rabbi Reichhorn.\" Professor Serge Nilus of Russi a published the Jewish \"Pro- tocols\" in 1905. They purport to represent the minutes of secret meetings of the leading men of the Jewish race, and to set forth their plans for acquiring the'wealth of the peoples of the world, for the overthrow of all governments, and for the creation of the Kingdom of the Jews with a Jewish king. It is stated in the in- troduction of the booklet that the protocols means \"minutes of the proceedings of th e Learned Elders of Zion and that these protocols give the substance of addresses delivered to the inner- most circles of th e rulers of Zion.\" It is also stated that \"the presumption is strong that the protocols were issued or re-issu ed at the first Zionist Congress held at Basle (Switzerland) in 1897 under the presidency of the father of modern Zion ism, the late Theodore Herzl.\" It is also stated that the names of the pr esent elders are a profound se- cret, that they are the \"Hidden Hand\" that rules the world, and that they probably consist of \"three hundred men, each of whom knows all of the others, govern the fate of the European conti- nent, and they elect their succe ssors from their entourage.\" (Quoting the late Walter Rathna u, a Jew of Germany, as au- thority.) The \"Learned Elders of Zion\" was probably a religious order in the beginning, as indicated by the name. But if such was the original foundation of the order, its charac ter, and like- wise its name, has since been ch anged. It is now purely a politi- cal racial organization and its present name is the \"Council of the Jewish Agency.\" It is likely that the name was changed on account of the exposure by Nilus. This order must be distinguish ed from \"Elders of the Syna- gogue\" and \"Elders of Israel,\" wh ich are purely religious or- ganizations. It must also be distinguished from the \"Zionist"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Congress\" and \"Zionist Genera l Council.\" These two latter or- ganizations are semi-re ligious and semi-po litical and they are also semi-secret and semi-public. They are composed wholly of members of the Zionist church, but not all Jews by any means are church-men. It is also to be distinguished from the ancient Jewish Sy- marium or San Hedrin which was the supreme judicial and ad- ministrative authority during th e reign of the Roman Herod, when Christ was crucified. It was composed of their \"Chief Priests, rulers, scribes, and El ders.\" and was at that time the supreme judicial and poli tical Jewish authority. A recent convention of the \"Zionist Congress\" was held in Zurich, Switzerland, for the pur pose of considering the parti- tion of Palestine, which was attended by 480 delegates, from all countries. It appears from the pr oceedings of this convention that Professor Chaim Weinzmann, formerly of Russia but now of England, was re-elected as president of this international con- gress ; that Rabbi Wise of New Yo rk is president of the American branch; that an exec utive committee of el even was appointed with full authority to act; that the \"Zionist General Council\" was increased from 54 to 70, th e additional members being ap- pointed by the convention. It appears also from the procee dings of this convention that it defined the policy of the Zionist Church toward the partition of Palestine, subject to the appr oval of the \"Council of the Jew- ish Agency\" the final authority—the present \"Learned Elders of Zion,\" the secret three hund red, the \"Hidden Hand.\" It ap- pears also that th e Royal Commission of the British Govern- ment made its report regardi ng the partition of Palestine to Lord Rothschild as a member of the \"Council of the Jewish Agency\" and not to Professor Weinzmann as the head of the \"Zionist Congress.\" It appears also that the reason therefor is the fact that the \"Council of th e Jewish Agency\" is the author- ized agency of the Jewish r ace—sectarian and non-sectarian. Thus the supreme authority of this \"Jewish Agency\" is of- ficially recognized by both the British Government and the Zion- ist Congress, alt hough the latter is compos ed of regularly elect- ed delegates from all countries of the world. What is it? Who are its present members? By what authority does it act? What are its purposes? And why all of this secrecy if its purposes are honest and legitimate? "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"We cannot know much about this order because of its secret character and its secr et methods. We know that Lord Rothschild was until his recent death a memb er of it, and th at Lord Mel- chett of England is now said to be its chairman. We may as- sume that the Rothschild family have dominated it since the time of Amschel Rothschild. It is the government of the financial power of the Jewish race that rules the world, including Amer- ica. It is the cabal of the lead ing Jewish bankers and politicians who were formerly called the \"Elders of Zion\" and now the \"Council of the Jewish Agency.\" Whatever may have been the original character and purposes of the \"Learned Elders of Zion\" there can be no doubt about the fact that there was such an organization, that it now exists in some form, and that it is seek ing to carry out the program set out in the protocols and according to the plan of the protocols. There is no other explanation of the secret \"Council of the Jew- ish Agency\" and its achievements. There is no other explanation of the Versailles peace treaty, th e League of Nations, the Bank of International Settlements, the International Labor Board, the deliberate impoverishment of the people of the world by the manipulations of the Elders, and for the present wars and past wars. This is all a definite progr am with a defini te purpose, and that program and purpose are trul y set out with brutal frank- ness in the protocols."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"10 II. The Protocols Are Authentic \" 'Per me reges requant.' 'It is through me that kings reign.' And it was said by the prophets that we were chosen by God himself to rule over the whole earth. God has endowed us with genius that we may he equal to our task.\"—From Protocol 5. The Jews, of course, deny the au thenticity of the Protocols. It is natural that they should do so. To adm it it would be to de- feat the purposes of their scheme. Moreover, the plan itself calls for such secrecy and duplicity. The program is so cruel, so inhuman, so diabolical, and the objects to be accomplis hed appear so fantas tic and remote that it is difficult to beli eve that this program still obtains. It should, however, be remembered that since the publications of the proto- cols a great and powerful nation, Russia, has been conquered by a handful of Jews; that Kuhn, Loeb & Co., Paul Warburg, and other Jews, financed the coup de etat by which the Jews secured control of the Russian government; and that the cruel and in- human methods set out in the pr otocols were followed mercilessly in Russia by its Jewish governme nt. It should be also remem- bered that the Jewish Second and Third Internationals of Russia are now actively organizing the forces of communism in every country of the worl d, including our own. There are more Jews in Americ a today than there were in Russia when the government was overthrown, and they are much more powerful an d aggressive. It is estimated that there are now 80 times more communists in America than there were in Russia at that time. The same methods that were employed for the overthrow of the Czarist regime are being pursued here, viz: political corr uption and class hatred. As cruel and inhuman and incred ible as are the protocols, they are no more so than the Talmud, whose authenticity the Jews admit. In fact the spirit and philosophy of the protocols permeate the Talmud, and vice versa. They are both founded upon the false premise that the Je ws are a superi or people and that they are the \"chosen\" people. They both breathe the same hatred and contempt for the Christian Gen tile whom they call the 'goyim.' They both not only justify but advocate the exploit- ation and enslavement of the despised 'goyim.' "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"11 The Talmud is the law and gospel of the Jews. It is their bible and civil law as defined and interpreted by their chief priests and Rabbis. \"It must be admitted by every critical student of history that the Talmud has not merely been the means of keeping alive the religious idea among the Jews, but has formed their strongest bond of union.\"* It is not the Talmud but the rabbi that has kept alive the racial and religious solidarity and bigotry and intolerance of the Jews. The following brief quotatio ns from \"The Talmud Un- masked\"** are examples of it: \"The life of a Goi and all his powers belong to a Jew.\" (A. Rohl. Die Polem. p. 20).\" (P. 71). \"In Choschen Ham. (266.1) it says: 'A Jew may keep anything he finds which belongs to the Akum, for it is written: Return to thy brethren what is lost (Deuter. XXII, 3). For he who returns lost property (to Christians) sins against the Law by increasing the power of the transgressors of the Law.\"' (P. 72). \"In Midrasch Talpioth (fol. 225d) it says: 'God created them in the form of men for the glory of Israel. But Akum were created for the sole end of ministering unto them (the Jews) day and night. Nor can they ever be relieved of this service. It is becoming to the so n of a king (an Israelite) that animals in their natural form, and animals in the form of hu- man beings should minister unto him'.\" (P. 50). \"And in Eben Haezer (44, 8) : 'If a Jew enters into mar- riage with an Akum (Christian), or with his servant, the mar- riage is null. For they are not capable of entering into mat- rimony. Likewise if an Akum or a servant enter into matri- mony with a Jew, the marriage is null'.\" (P. 51). Many of these dicta are ancient but have never been repud- iated or repealed and th e spirit of them still prevails. They still constitute the law for the Jews, both civil and ecclesiastical. The Talmud is made up of the decisi ons and interpretations of the rabbis, in the same manner th at our common law has been formed by our judges and commentators. No matter how ancient the dictum, it is the law until overruled by a contrary one. *Encyclopedia Britannica, Vol. 23, p. 38. **\"The Talmud Unmasked\" by Rev. I. B. Prainatis, Copy- righted by Col. E. N. Sanctuary, 156 Fifth Avenue, New York, N. Y."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"12 The Jewish Encyclopedia, Vo l 4, p. 294-296, defines the rabbis' function s as follows: \"Rabbi (my master); function to teach the scriptures and the oral and traditional laws . . . In the Jewish religion the rabbi is no priest, no apostle, he has no hierarchical authority. He is a teacher, one who unfolds and explains religion, teaches the young in the school, the old from the pulpit, and both by his writings.\" The reader should observe the intermingling of their civil and religious laws. Both appear to be based on th eir interpreta- tion of the old testament (see reference to Deuter. XXII, 3 above). They are so confused that it is impossible to determine where their religion ends and their civil law begins. It is clear, however, that both in a civil and religious sense they regard themselves as a \"chosen\" people, a superior race who are entitled to ru le us (the 'goyim') , and are entitled to our services and to everything we have. We Gentiles were cre- ated for the purpose of serving them, of being their slaves. Al- though in the form of \"human bei ngs\" we are no better than ani- mals. We are not worthy of marr ying one of them, either man or woman, and if we do, such marriage is illegal and void. They have adhered to this law rather religiously throughout the ages and in all countries. The author sums up their estimate of us (the goyim) as follows: \"They are idolaters, the worst kind of people, much worse than the Turks, murderers, forn icators, impure animals, like dirt, unworthy to be called men, beasts in human form, worthy of the name of beasts, cows, asses, pigs, dogs, worse than dogs; that they propagate after the ma nner of beasts, that they have a diabolic origin, that their souls come from the devil and re- turn to the devil in hell after death; and that even the body of a dead Christian is nothing different from that of an ani- mal.\"* The following are samples of th eir estimate of Christians and of our Savior, Jesus Christ: \"In Hilkhoth Akum\" (X, 1) it says: 'Do not eat with idol- aters, nor permit them to worship their idols; for it is written: Make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them (Deu- ter. ch. 7 ) ; 2 ) . Either turn them away from their idols or kill them.' *The Talmud Unmasked. P. 46."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"13 \"Ibidem (X, 7) : 'In places where Jews are strong, no idolater must be allowed to remain'.\"** \"The book Zohar, III (282) tells us that Jesus died like a beast and was buried in that 'dirt heap . . . where they throw the dead bodies of dogs and asses, and where the sons of Esau (the Christians) and of Ismael (the Turks), also Jesus and Mahommad, uncircumcized and unclean like dead dogs, are buried.\"*** The author sums up their verdict as follows: \"The Talmud teaches that Jesus Christ was illegitimate arid was conceived during menstruation; that he had the soul of Esau; that he was a fool, a conjurer, a seducer; that he was crucified, buried in hell and set up as an idol ev er since by his followers.\" (P. 30). They call this a religion and they insist on their privilege to worship God as th ey choose, and they decry our intolerance and bigotry. The Christian religi on is based upon love and char- ity and repentance and the forg iveness of sin. There is no charity, no love, no repentance he re; there is not hing but pride, intolerance, and hatred. The Christian religion is everything the Talmud is not, and the Talmud is everything the Christian religion is not; it and its devotees are the anti-Christ. We have the spectacle now of a Jewish rabbi, a Catholic priest and a Protestant preacher going about over the country at Jewish expense preaching tolerance; a virtue that is utterly foreig n to the Jewish religion and the Jewish character. The chief priests and rabbis who wrote the various and numerous dissertations set forth in the Talmud could have writ- ten the protocols. They are of kindred nature and expression; they are made of the same cloth and patterned in the same fash- ion. We prefer to think that the Talmud and the pr otocols mis- represent the viewpoint of the Jews that we know and with whom we come in daily contact, a nd that may be true of many of them. However that may be, we k now that the Jews hold them- selves as a race apart and that they adhere reli giously to their ancient racial customs and ritu als and organizations.

These and similar proclamations as set forth in the Talmud, constitute the \"bond\" that has held the race together. They ex- plain the fact that the Jew does not assimilate with other races. They are based on the false assumption that the Jews are a \"chosen\" and superior people. The Talmud is mistaken. The Jews are not a \"chosen\" or a superior people. God never ma de any such mistake as that. The history of the race is not one of achievement of anything except money. It is one of chiselling and of defrauding the peo- ples of the various countries in which they have resided, which has often been followed by their own alleged persecution. In this life we usually reap what we sow, or in common parlance, \"get what is coming to us.\" The history of Judaism is proof of the truth of this proverb. It may be conceded that the Jew is more shrewd and cun- ning, and a better trader and ma nipulator of money than the Gentile—but that represents the limit of his superiority and achievements. The Jew has contributed but little to science, invention, art, to the wealth of nations, or to the advancement of civilization. I hope that I am not intolerant and anti-Semit ic, but I con- fess that I have no patience with a religion that denounces Christ as a bastard, an imposter and a cheat, and that glories in his crucifixion; and I am against a race that holds me as an inferior being and seeks to enslave me. I ne vertheless wish to be fair and just, as well as candid and plai n-spoken, in my discussion of the subject. I can make allowance for the fa ct that the Jews feel, and probably righteously s o, an ancient grievance against the Gen- tiles because of past oppressions, which is kept alive by their rabbis and Learned Elders and their protocols and Talmud. But it is high time for them to get over it, to forget their vengeance and to abandon their am bitious designs, par ticularly here in America where we do not want to harm them, and wish to accord them all of the rights and privileges we enjoy. The renegade Gentiles who coope rate with them in further- ing their villainous sc heme, viz., to enslave the peoples of the world, are no better than the Jews.

The Jews Defense \"For what purpose then have we invented this whole pol- icy and insinuated it into the minds of the goys without giving them any chance to examine its underlying meaning? For what, indeed, if not in order to obtain in a roundabout way what is for our scattered tribe unattainable by the direct road? It is this which has served as the basis for our organiza- tion of secret masonry which is not known to, and aims which are not even so much as suspected by these goy cattle, attracted by us into the \"show\" army of masonic lodges in order to throw dust in the eyes of their fellows.\"—From Protocol 11. The Liberty Magazine (Feb. 10 and 17, 1940) published two articles under th e heading \"The Jews and Free Masonry— Exploding the Myth of a World Conspiracy,\" wr itten by Louis B. Davidson and Frederic L. Co llins. These articles represent the flimsy and threadbare defens e of the Jews that has been published from time to time in various forms. They purport to contain a synopsis of the testim ony given in the trial at Berne, Switzerland, where the trial co urt found the defendant book- sellers guilty and declared the pr otocols to be \"forgery, plagiar- ism, and obscene literature.\" There is some historical truth in this story, mixed as it is with much that is false, but the conclusions based upon this admixture are wholly false. It is true as they assert, that \"there is no international organization of Free-masonry, and the or- ganization of each natio n is independent of all others.\" The continental masonry is composed wholly of Jews and hybrids. While the Jews are permitted to be masons in America (Cath- olics are excluded), th ey do not dominate th e order and it is not a racial one and is not communis tic. It is a non-political fra- ternal benevolent organization, wh ile continental masonry is a political, malevolent one. No one claims, except the authors of these articles, that \"the noble order of Freemasons should be drawn into this cam- paign or calumny,\" or \"links free masonry w ith world Jewry in a mythical conspira cy to rule the world. \" It is admitted, as these authors allege, that the \"Illuminati\" founded by the Jew Adam Weishaupt was a branch of the continental masons and that \"the chief aim of this orga nization . . . was the destruction of all forms of religion, governme nt, property, marriage, and all "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"17 civil rights,\" which is likewise the present chief aim of the \"Learned Elders of Zion,\" and of the Jewish communist party. It is also admitted, as they allege, that the Illuminati \"played a major role in bringing on the bloody days of 1789 (French Revolution), that it was founded and reputedly financed by Jews,\" and that the \"great Hous e of Rothschild was then just rising to the financia l heights.\" There is evidence that it was in fact financed by the \"great House of Rothsc hild;\" and the French revolution was in fact br ought about by th e Jews. It was the final act that fre ed the Jews from th eir political and civil disabilities in France. It is also true, as they allege, that the \"Kerensky govern- ment in 1917 confiscat ed the entire issue (of the protocols) ex- cept one volume which had been sent to th e British museum. It is said that the Jew Kerensky no t only destroyed al l of the cop- ies to be found in Russia but th at every Gentile found in pos- session of one was murdered. What str onger proof of guilt could there be? Men do not fear li es and forgeries; it is the truth that the guilty al ways want to suppress. The copy that was sent to th e British Museum was trans- lated by Victor Marsden, a repr esentative of the London Morn- ing Post, who had previously resi ded in Russia for many years. It is true, as they allege, that the protocols have been translated into French, Italian, Arabic, German, Japanese and Scandina- vian languages. It is said that their circulation is second only to that of the bible. I have no means of knowing wh ether the protocols are re- sponsible for the pogroms in Russia , as detailed in the articles mentioned. They have undoubtedl y created a profound impres- sion throughout the world, which is evidence that people believe them despite the Jewish control of the press, and their ridicule and their denials. \"Are they authentic? Shouted the alarmed editor of the (Jewish owned) London Times in May 1920,\" according to these authors. \"What malevolent soci ety made these schemes and is now triumphing over their rea lization? Are they forged? From where does the weird gift of prophecy spring that partly has come true and is partly to be realized? . . . Have we es- caped a German peace by strain ing all our national resources only to submit to a Jewish peace?\" (Which is precisely what hap- ened). The above quotation is fro m the Liberty article. They do"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"18 not tell us what the Jewish owners did to this \"alarmed editor.\" They probably crucified him. It is not true that Nilus was a \"briefle ss avocat\" in Russia and it is not true that he wrote the protocols to \"find favor with the Grand Duchess Elizabeth.\" Ev en the authors of the Liberty articles do not vouch for this fa ntastic story. Why then men- tion it? On the contrary, Nilus was a reputable educator and author of unimpeachable integr ity. He believed that the \"Hid- den Hand\" was the author of the protocols, and such was also the belief of Victor Marsden the translator, and such is also the belief of millions of people in all countries. Assuming that the authors have correctly quoted the various paragraphs from \"Maurice Joly 's Dialogues in Hell,\" it must be admitted that there is evident plagiarism by the real author of the protocols. But that does not prove that Nilus was the pla- giarist. If the \"dialogues in he ll\" truly represented the hellish plans of the Elders it is but natural that th ey should adopt them and use them. In that case they are the plagiarists. The weakest part of the whol e argument is the statement of the evidence upon which the Bern e trial court predicated its judgment. It is in substance as follows: The Princess Catherine Radziwill testified that she knew \"the Paris agent of the Rus- sian secret police and that she knew Golovinsky, very well;\" that Golovinsky had access to Joly's Dialogues, that he \"came to her home with parts of the script whic h he showed and read to her; . . . that his job was to prove to the Czar that the Jews had formed an international plot to conquer the world.\" She was asked, \"Could you desc ribe Golovinsky's draft?\" She replied, \"Yes, as he kept reading passages to me I became familiar with the entire script. He later showed me the com- pleted manuscript. It was identic al with the Protocols of Zion, which I later saw in the various Nilus editions. It was written in French in a variety of ha ndwritings. It was on yellowish paper; there was a big circular bl ue ink blot on the first page.\" \"This description was confirmed by the Count du Chayla, who described the text as unidi omatic and showing every sign of having been written by a fore igner on cheap yellowish paper —and said that on the first page was a circular ink blot.\" It should be remembered that this trial wa s in 1935, just thirty years after th e publication of the pr otocols in 1905. It must be conceded that these two witnesses who were able to re- "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"19 member the contents of a lengthy document that did not con- cern them, and an ink spot thereon, for such a long period of time, had most remarkable memo ries. It is obv iously manu- factured testimony, but if all they said were true it does not prove that Nilus forged the protoc ols or that they are spurious. The decision of the Bern tr ial court was re versed by the appellate court, which the said Liberty authors failed to mention. This reversal is not surprising in view of the utter lack of com- petent and credible evidence. It should be also remembered that the Jews selected their own court in which to file their suit. It is a cinch that they selected a Jewish or pro-Jewish one. They wanted to be able to proclaim to the world, as they do, that the courts have adjudged that the protocols are spurious. In passing judgment on the Jews and their denials, it should always be remembered that the Talmud enjoins them to deceive the Christians, to lie to them a nd to cheat them. It is their law and their religion, and it is the part of it that many of them ob- serve industriously and enthusiastically. We \"goyim\" are as dumb and gullible as they believe us to be if we accept such flimsy explanations at par. The succeeding chapters of this book will prove conclusive- ly that the \"Learned Elders of Zion\"—the present Council of the Jewish Agency are now ceas elessly and rele ntlessly pursu- ing their ancient plan to enslave the people of the world and to establish their world empire. There can be no proof of such a secret conspiracy other than by its fruits. There can be no expla- nation of current events or of the worlds history for the past 150 years except the machinations of the financial power that has governed it during that period of time. It will be hereafter proven with reasonable certainty that the protocols contain the law of the Rothschild money power that now rules every country of the world, including our own. The protocols are the \"law of our bank\" to which Rabbi Reich- horn referred in his funeral oration (see Appendix II). They are the law of the Bank of England, the Bank of France, the New York Federal Reserve Bank, the Washington Federal Re- serve Board, J. P. Morgan & Co., and Kuhn, Loeb & Co., and of N. M.

Mayer Amschel Rothschild First King of the Jews \"The King of the Jews will be the real Pope of the Uni- verse, the patriarch of an international church.\" —From Protocol 17. MAYER AMSCHEL ROTHSCHILD, 1—1790-1812. Mayer Amschel was born in 1743 and died Sept. 29, 1812. He married Gutter Schnaper in 1770. They had a large family consisting of five sons and five daughters. He was educated as a rabbi and in his early life was both a rabbi and a junk and coin dealer. He became a money lender and in that connection acted as agent for William IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel. There is much obscurity in th e history of th e Rothschild family, due to the fact that th eir operations are always secret and the historians are either Semitic or anti-Semitic, the ma- jority being Semitic. The conclusions here presented are based principally on Jewish or pro-Jewish history. I shall quote lib- erally from the Jewish Encyclopedia because it was, as stated in its preface, \"prepared by mo re than 400 scholars and special- ists\" all of whom were Jews.* It was published in 1905 and re-published in 1909. While it is a partisan history, it is on the whole, accurate in its statements of fact—it at least presents the Jew version of the facts. The authority mentioned says: \"In a latter connection (money lender) he became an agent of William IX, Landgrave cf Hesse-Cassel, who on his fa- ther's death in 1785 had inherited the largest private fortune in Europe (estimated at $40,000,000) derived mainly from the hire of troops to the British government for the putting down of the revolution in the United States . . . After the battle qf June in 1806 the Landgrave fled to Denmark, leaving 600,000 pounds (about $3,000,000) with Mayer Rothschild for safe keeping.\" It states further: \"According to legend this money was hidden away in wine casks and escaping the search of Napoleon's soldiers when they entered Frankfort, was restored intact in the same casks in 1814 when the elector returned to the electorate. The facts are somewhat less romantic and more business-like.\" *Jewish Ency. Vol. X, p. 499 et seq."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"22 The facts are entirely \"less ro mantic and more business- like,\" (from the Jewish standp oint). Mayer Amschel Roths- child embezzled the money. This money was tainted from its very origin. It was paid by the British government to the Land- grave for the services of his soldiers, used to suppress the Amer- ican revolution, and the soldiers were morally ent itled to it. It was first embezzled by William of Hesse and then by Mayer Amschel. This twice-stolen money is the foundation of the huge Rothschild fortune. It has ever since been true to its origin. There is not an honestly acquire d dollar in the hundreds of bil- lions now possessed by the Rothschild family. Instead of putting the money in wine casks, Mayer Roths- child sent the entire sum, with his son Natha n, to London, and then and there established the London branch of the family. \"Nathan . . . invested it in 800,000,000 pounds of gold from the East India Company, knowing that it would be need- ed for Wellington's peninsula campaign. He made no less than four profits: (1) on the sale of Wellington's paper (which he bought at 50c on the dollar and collected at par); (2) on the sale of gold to Wellington; (3) on its re-purchase; and (4) on forwarding it to Portugal. This was the beginning of the great fortune.\" (p. 494). This was indeed much \"less romantic and more business- like.\" With this vast sum of mo ney, branches of the House of Rothschild were established in Berlin, Paris, Vienna and Na- ples, with one of the brothers in charge of each of them. AH of these houses were exceedingly prosperous, particularly the Lon- don and Paris branches. The founder of this huge fortune, Mayer Amschel Roths- child, established four fundament al principles for its govern- ment, which the sons and their descendents have observed, viz: (1) The eldest son of the eldest son to be the head and ruler of the fortune. He became the head by virtue of his sen- iority unless the majo rity of the members of the family decided otherwise. There have been only two exceptions to this rule so far as revealed by history, and that was the appointment of Na- than, the third son of Mayer Amsc hel, as its head, and later the appointment of James the fifth so n. By reason of his achieve- ments Nathan was appointed the head of the fortune upon Mayer Amschel's death in 1812. (2) The inter-marriage of cousins. This was for the pur-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"pose of preserving the family fortune intact and in the family. This rule has not been strictly observed, particularly by the female members of the family, du e no doubt partially to rebel- lion on the part of some members of the family and partially to the fact that other Jews have become very rich and by rea- son of marriage the family fortune has been enhanced rather than depleted. \"The number of marriages between cousins in the late his- tory of the family is remarkable ... Of 58 marriages, 29, or exactly one-half, have been between first cousins. It is note- worthy that these marriages have been fertile and that most of the children have been girls, which is what is anticipated by biological science.\" (3) The unity of the family fortune and its concealment. No copy of Mayer Amschel's will has been publis hed by any of the historians of the family. All that we are permitted to know about it is what the historians say of it, by the record of the family and by the reference to it in the will of on e of his grand- sons, Anselm, of Vienna. It contains the following provision: \"In accordance with the exhortations of my father, the grandfather who so sincerely loved them (Anselm's children), as contained in Clause 15 of his will, may they and their des- cendants remain constantly tr ue to their ancestral Jewish faith. \"I forbid them most explicitly, in any circumstances whatever, to have any public inventory made by the courts, or otherwise, of my estate . . . Also I forbid any legal action, and any publication of the value of the inheritance . . . Any- one who disregards these provisions and takes any kind of ac- tion which conflicts with them shall immediately be regarded as having disputed the will, and shall suffer the penalties for so doing.\"* (4) A perpetual family partners hip. At the time of Mayer Amschel's death, his entire estate was in the form of a partner- ship composed of himself and hi s five sons, each having an equal interest, under the firm name of M. A. Rothschild & Sons. Both the partnership agreement and Mayer Amschel's will provided that the partners and their male descendants should forever constitute the firm and manage it. The will provided also that the female members of the family and their heir s and husbands should have no part in the management of the firm and that they should receive their interest in the estate subject to the manage- ment of the male members; and th at if any of th em should con- *The Reign of the House of Rothschild, p. 405."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"24 test this arrangement that they would lose their interest in the estate. Later, Nathan organized the L ondon firm of N. M. Roths- child & Sons on the sa me plan. This firm was probably owned in equal proportions by him and his brothers and governed in the same manner as the parent partnership. Originally the partnership ag reement provided that no im- portant decision should be made without the approval of all the partners. As the fortune grew in magnitude it became im- practical to hold partners c onferences upon its numerous under- takings. It is probable that Nathan's firm was organized in part to meet that situation and for the purpose of separating the activities of the London house fr om those of the continental houses. It was probably Mayer Amsche l's purpose in the beginning to establish a Jewish dynasty w ith his male descendants as rulers. Whether that was his purpose or not, it was the effect of his will. He established the kingdom of the Jews that has since been governed by his male descendants. Wherever a Jew is located, whatever nationality he may claim, he is a subject of this kingdom; his allegiance and duty to it supersedes his allegi- ance and duty to the coun try in which he dwells. If a conflict develops between the government of his adopted country and his racial government, the Jew will always be found on the side of his race. He may not know the pe rsonnel of his racial government, its decisions may be unwritten, but they will reach him in some form, through his rabbis and through secret societies, and he is always obedient to them. That fact furnishes the explanation of all this Jewi sh war propaganda which is sup- ported blindly and withou t dissent by all Jews. At the time of Mayer Amsche l's death he was by far the richest man in the world or that had ever lived. The magnitude of his fortune at that time is unknown. It was growing by leaps and bounds at such a rapid rate that it probably could not be estimated. He knew the power of money and the wisdom of secrecy. He believed with religious fervor that the Jews were the \"chosen people\" and that God had promised them that they should rule the world. We cannot know whether at th at time he had in contem- plation a Jewish world empire. Apparently this was a later development. There is good reason to believe that this ambitious enterprise was initiated by Theo dore Herzl a short time before "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"25 the publication of the protocols in 1905. Herzl was an active, am- bitious Jewish rabbi-po litician and an intens e hater of the Gen- tiles. He was given credit for organizing modern Zionism at a conference of the leaders of the Hebrew race in Basle, Switzer- land, in 1897. It is thought that at that time and at that meeting some of the protocols were adop ted as precepts for the estab- lishment of the contemplated Jewish empire. Herzl probably organized two important Jewish organiza- tions: (1) a secret super-organi zation to be composed of 300 men whose identity should be ke pt secret and who would con- stitute the super-government for the Jewish race; (2) a popular religious organization to be comp osed of 450 delegates selected by the rabbis and the Hebrew churches. At that time the Rothschild estate had grown to enormous proportions but the family had gr own soft with luxury and had deteriorated by inbreeding. Moreover the fortune at that time had already effected the emancipation of the Jews and estab- lished the Rothschild kingdom. Apparently it then had the power under efficient management to establish a Jewish empire. Apparently also the management of the vast political power of the estate needed to be reinforced with outside blood. It is likely that at that time and thro ugh Herzl's activities, the Secret Committee of 300 was established for the management of the political power of the huge estate with the consent of the Roths- childs. It is known that Theodor e Herzl was an intimate personal friend of Lord Rothschild, II. The protocols themselves, or the gist of them, appear to have existed for a long period of time prior to their publication in 1905. In fact the intent and purp ose of them are in substance contained in the Talmud. They we re also in substance stated in 1869 in the Funeral Oration of Rabbi Reichhorn (set out in Appendix II). They evince a clear conception of the weakness of Gentile governments and inst itutions, and the best method to attack and destroy them. They set out the most effective method of establishing a dictatorsh ip of the proletariat, which is the first step toward world empire. The protocols themselves describe in great detail the powers of the King-Despot of their propo sed empire, and the objectives of such empire. Stated briefly they are the absorption of the wealth of the Gentiles and their slavery, both politically and economically. They have already accomplished the debt slavery of the goyim; their present objective is his political slavery."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"26 V. The Rothschild Dynasty \"Our power in the present tottering condition of all forms of power will be more invincible than any other, because it will remain invisible until the moment when it has gained such strength that no cunning can any longer undermine it.\"— From Protocol I. King Amschel Rothschild I, was succeeded upon his death by his third son, Nathan, of L ondon, on account of his uncanny and unscrupulous financial ability , and because of his achieve- ments. He had, prior to Amschel's death, established the pri- vate banking house of N. M. Rothschild & Sons, and added enormously to the family fortune. It appears that the elder brother, Mayer Amschel, jr., who continued in charge of the Frankfort branch, recognized the superior qualifications of Nathan and was willing to waive his right by virtue of primo geniture. Nathan was therefore c hosen by the four brothers as his father's successor. KING NATHAN ROTHSCHILD II.—1812-1836. Nathan married the sister-i n-law of Moses Montefiore, \"thus coming into association with the heads of the Sephardic community then ruling the financial worl d of Lond on through their connection with Amsterdam. \"* Nathan is described by the historian John Reeves, a Roth schild partisan, as being a very shrewd, unscrupulous and uncouth man, and exceedingly close-fisted. He says that \"he never paid his employees a far- thing more than was necessary for their bare subsistence or at least not a farthing more than they could compel him to pay.\"** The Jew, Benjamin Disraeli, in his novel \"Coningsby,\" denominates Nathan and also hi s son Lionel as \"Sidonia.\" He says of the elder \"Sidonia\": \"He arrived here (London) af ter the peace of Paris with his large capital. He staked all that he was worth on the Waterloo loan and the event made him one of the greatest capitalists in Europe . . . He reaped the due reward of his sagacity. Europe did require money and Sidonia was ready to lend it to Europe. France wanted some, Austria more, Prus- sia a little, Russia a few millions ; Sidonia could furnish them all. The only country which he avoided was Spain; he was too well acquainted with its resources.\" *Jewish Ency., Vol. X, p. 494. **\"The Rothschilds,—Financial Rulers of Nations.\""},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"27 Disraeli says of him further: \"He established a brother or a near relative in whom he could confide, in most of the principal capitals. He was lord and master of the money markets of the world and of course virtually lord and master of everything else. He lit- erally held the revenues of southern Italy in pawn, and mon- archa and ministers of all countries courted his advice and were guided by his suggestions.\" John Reeves, in his book \"The Rothschilds,\" says: \"One cause of his (Nathan's) success was the secrecy with which he shrouded, and the tortuous policy with which he mis- led those who watched him the keenest.\" (P. 189). And this principle, it may be added, has governed the management of the Rothschild fortune from its beginning to this hour. The historian Reeves descri bes vividly how upon Nathan's return from near the battle of Waterloo (t he Jews are usually observers of battles, not participants), he went post haste to the English Channel and there hired a boat at excessive cost and crossed the English ch annel in stormy weather, and from there rushed to the London stock exchange, appearing muddy and dejected, where he passed out the word that Wellington had been defeated at Waterloo, and re inforced this by ostentatiously dumping stocks on the market. Th is created a great panic upon the exchange and ever ybody dumped their stocks at sacrifice prices. In the meantime Nathan, through his agents, was se- cretly buying them. There were no telegraphs or telephones or radios or fast posts in those days. It was several days before the news reached London that Wellington had won the battle of Waterloo. There was then great rejoic ing and the stock ma rket rebounded and stocks went to unprecedented heights, when Nathan unloaded his stocks. This is precisely the method that the Rothschilds have fol- lowed since, and is one of the methods by which they have amassed their huge fortune. \"Nat han boasted that he had multi- plied their capital 2500 times in the course of five years.\"* If this is true, it means that at that ti me (about 1820) the capital of the English branch had been increased from $3,000,000 to about $ 7,500,000,000. *\"The Rothschilds, Financial Rulers of Nations,\" p. 167."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"28 Nathan established the private banking firm of N. M. Roths- child & Sons in London, with branch es in Paris, Berlin, Vienna and Naples. This firm operates on the exchanges, underwrites government and other loans; it is the agent and manager of banks, railways, steel, munitions , and other corporations. It has branches under many names. In America it is represented by Kuhn, Loeb & Co., and formerly by August Belmont & Co. It is probable also that J. P. Morgan & Co., Seligman & Co., Speyer & Co., Lehman & Co., and other private Jewish banks are its under-cover branches. Lionel Rothschild, the eldest son of Nathan, succeeded him as the head and managing partner of N. M. Rothschild & Sons. He is described by his fellow tribesman, Disraeli, as follows: \"He perceived himself a lone being, alike without cares and without duties; his religion walled him out from the pur- suits of a citizen . . . He was a man without affections . . . The only human quality that interested 'Sidonia' was intellect . . . No minister of state had such communication with secret agents and political spies as Sidonia; he held relations with all the clever outcasts of the world. The catalogue of his acquaint- ance in the shape of Greeks, Ar menians, Moors, secret Jews, Tartars, gypsies, wandering Poles and Carbonari, would throw a curious light on those subterranean agencies of which the world in general knows so little, but which exercise so great an influence on public events.\"** The Jewish Encyclopedia states: \"Lionel was the friend and counselor of the Prince Con- sort and of Disraeli, whose Sidonia in \"Coningsby\" is an ideal portrait of him . . . that he brought about in 1858 the enact- ment of the disabilities bill which permitted the Jews to hold office in England . . . \"He advanced the British government the money for the Irish famine loan (about $40,000,000) and also for the Crim- ean war (about $80,000,000), and that for twenty years he acted as agent for the Russian government. \"He had a large share in th e successful funding of the United States national debt, provided the funds for the imme- diate purchase of the Suez Canal shares; he was also active in facilitating the payment of the French indemnity to Ger- many, in directing the finances of the Austrian Empire, and the Egyptian loan of 8,500,000 pounds.

He ran and was elected a second ti me, with the same result. Upon his third election the oath was wa ived as to the New Testament and he was sworn in on the Old Testament. He was the first Jew to hold office in England. Thus began the pollution and deterioration of the British Government. Lionel's eldest son, Nathan Ma yer (Lord Rothschild 1st) succeeded him as head of N. M. Rothschild & Sons on his death in 1879. The Jewish En cyclopedia states that: \"In 1885 he (Nathan) was raised to the peerage and was the first Jew to take his seat in the House of Lords, an event which was regarded as completing the emancipation of the Jews . . . Lord Rothschild is a governor of the Bank of Eng- land and a presiding officer of many great corporations . . . In 1902 he was appointed a member of the Royal Commission on Alien Immigration, an office that brought him in touch with the late Theodore Herzl.\"* Nathan's promotion from the House of Commons to the peerage was recommended by Pr ime Minister Wm. E. Glad- stone and Lord Grenville. Queen Victoria at first objected on the ground that \"to make a Jew a peer is a step she could not consent to; it would be ill-ta ken and would do the government great harm.\"** Unfortunately, she yielded against her woman's intuition and her sound judgment. This was the beginning of the trans- formation of the British House of Lords from a Gentile landed aristocracy to a Jewish plutocra cy, and of the government from a Gentile to a Jewish government. It is reported that there are now sixty Jews in the House of Lords without counting the hybrids that should in fact be included. The intermarriage of the impoverished landed aristocrats with rich Jewesses has pollute d the bloodstream of the British aristocracy and to that extent weakened the government. While *Jewish Ency.

The Jew and the hybrid infest the House of Commons as well as the House of Lords. Many of the members of that body are Jewish owners of large estates elected by the tenants of such estates, as was Lionel. The pr esent decadent British Empire and government (Churchill, Eden, Cooper, et al.) are due pri- marily to the Jew and Jewish blood pollution. It is a Jewish government. The protocols were published by Nilus in 1905 but they themselves bear no date. They purport to be minutes of many meetings, some of which no d oubt occurred long prior to 1905. Theodore Herzl is thou ght to be the author of one or more of them, which were promulgated at the Basle meeting of the Elders of Zion (Council of the Jewish Agency). Whether this is true or not , the protocols represent the moral and political philosophy of the rulers of the Rothschild fortune. Mayer Amschel Rothschild hated the Gentiles with an intense religious hatr ed, and that hatred has been handed down from generation to generation. It is a hatred that demands ven- geance upon the Gentile race—\"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\" It is shown in every paragraph, every sentence and every word in the three codes of the family, viz., the Talmud, the protocols, and the code of the communists. Perhaps in the beginning it was justified, for the age in which Mayer Amschel lived was a cruel age and the Jews were undoubtedly despised and oppressed by the various peoples among whom they lived; this was particularly tr ue of the Ger- man and Russian peoples and govern ments. This hatred of the Gentile is still kept alive by the Council of the Jewish Agency, their protocols, and the rabbis and their Talmud. Nathan Mayer Rothsc hild died in 1915 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Lionel Walter, the second Lord Rothschild, as the head of the banking firm N. M. Rothschild & Sons. He appears to have been a member of the Council of the Jewish Agency. He died in 1937 and was succeeded as head of the London branch of the banking firm by his el dest son, Nathan Mayer Victor (third Lord Rothsc hild) who is th e present gold agent of the Bank of England.

KING ROTHSCHILD, III (B aron James), 1836-1868. Upon Nathan's death in 1836 the sceptre and the line of descent passed from Nathan's el dest son Lionel, head of the London house, to James Rothschil d, fifth son of Amschel, head of the Paris House. This despite the fact that Lionel was then 28 years old, had married in orthodox fashion his first cousin Carlotta, the daughter of his uncl e Solomon, was the manager of the richest banking branch of th e family, and was the ablest of them all. All of the Jewish hist orians agree that this change was made but none of th em assign any reason. Count Cherep-Spiridovich stat es the reason as follows: \"James Rothschild, born in 1792, misruled from 1836 until 1868. He married ugly Betty, the daughter of his bro- ther Solomon of Vienna. Because of the \"crime\" of Nathan the latter's son Lionel was deprived of the World's Throne. James became Rothschild III, Th us decided Amschel (Anselm) Salomon, and Karl Rothschild, who all gathered in July 1836 at Frankfort in order to judge and presumably to execute Nathan, possibly the only Rothschild, who through total lack of principle, wished to become a Christian, only that he could the easier deceive and enslave the English people.\"* All of the Jewish authorities agree that there was a gen- oral family reunion and a great banquet in Paris on the occasion of the marriage of Lionel; that Nathan was taken violently ill and seized with spasms indica ting poisoning; that the doctors were unable to diagnose the trou ble and that he died within a few hours. Whether he was poiso ned or not, the kingship of the Rothschild fortune passed from Nathan's heirs to his brother James and his heirs. History reveals but little about the reign of James. He appears to have been a cold, cr uel, shrewd, unscrupulous man who contributed materially to th e wealth of the Paris House. His personal wealth at the time of his death was estimated at 45,000,000 pounds,—or more than $200,000,000,—but this was only an estimate, since no invent ory of his estate was filed. KING ROTHSCHILD, IV., (Bar on Alphonse D.) 1868 to ------- . The most recent history of the Rothschild family is that of the Jewish Cecil Roth, published in 1939.

Therefore we can know but little about the reign of this monarch. John Reeves, in his book published in 1887, said: \"The present head of the firm in Paris is Baron Alphonse D. Rothschild, the eldest son of Baron James. He inherits much of his father's financial talent and is acknowledged by the rest of his relatives as the shrewdest and most able man of business among them. He is the head of the family not only on account of his ability but on account of his seniority, as he is the oldest of Mayer Amschel's grandsons.\"* KING ROTHSCHILD V or VI (Jeroboam Rothschild, alias Georges Mandel). The reign of this monarch is current and therefore nothing is known of it except what is revealed by current literature. We do not know when it began or whether he succeeded Alphonse, or whether there is an intervening ancestor, but he appears to be the present head of the Paris House, and King of the Roths- child fortune, and it appears that such was his position and power in 1918, when the Versa illes Peace Treaty was written. There is here presented a picture of him and his puppet Paul Reynaud, Premier of France, reproduced from the May 27, 1940, issue of \"Time Magazine,\" a Jewish publication. His countenance reveals his character. He appears to be a crafty, cruel, greedy, mean man, with not a single re deeming virtue, He is the product of four generations of treachery and in- breeding, and a true de scendant of \"ugly Betty.\" We can now better understand the infamous p eace treaty, the Brussels Finan- cial Conference, the depres sions of 1920, 1930 and 1937, the election of Franklin D. Rooseve lt, the New Deal, and the present World War. We do not know why he changed his name from Jeroboam Rothschild to Georges Mandel unless it was for the same reason that other Jews change their na mes, viz: to deceive. But why should he want to deceiv e unless it is to con ceal the fact that he is the present ruler of the welfare of all of the people of the world? We can understand why Isidore Isokowitz would change his name to Eddie Cantor. But the name Rothschild is eminently respectable and carries more we ight than Mandel.

The Wealth of the Rothschild Family \"Gold always has been and always will be the irresistible power. Handled by expert hands it always will be the most useful lever for those who possess it, and the object of envy for those who do not.\"—From \"Funeral Oration of Rabbi Reichhorn.\" According to the boast of Nathan Rothsc hild he increased the family fortune fr om $3,000,000 to ab out $7,500,000,000 within five years time, which wo uld be in abou t 1820. In 1848 the Paris house was reckoned at 600,000,000 francs as against 362,000,000 for all of the other Paris bankers. We have no historical information as to the wealth of the Berlin, Vienna and Naples branches. We do, how ever, know that they were strong enough to dominate the mone y markets of those capitals. At the rate of speed that Nathan traveled, viz., an increase of 500% a year, the fortune of the London branch alone would have been more than $100,000, 000,000 by 1840. It is not likely, however, that he continued to mu ltiply the family fortune 500% a year, but it is probab le that he continued to increase it at the rate of 10% or more, annually. At this rate it would have amounted to approximately $2 0,000,000,000 by 1 840, just 100 years ago. The imagination can scarcely conceive the immensity and power of such a fortune. The th ree greatest American fortunes have been the Rockefeller, Carn egie, and Ford, which together would not exceed $2,000,000,000. If those fortunes should be loaned at 5% compoun d interest the mere accumulation of int- erest would in the cour se of time, and not a very long time at that, consume the wealth of the world. But compound interest is only a small element of the Ro thschild fortune; it has been de- veloped by speculation on the exchanges preceding and fol- lowing wars and depressions as well as by the accumulation of interest. We can take pencil and paper and figure accurately the increase of $20,000,0 00,000 at 5% compoun d interest in 100 years time, but it is impossible to even approximate the profits from the manipulation of the exchanges. The Roths- childs, during that entire period of 100 years, have been active manipulators of every important stock and commodity exchange of the world."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"36 By virtue of their immense financial power they have been able to raise or lower prices at will, to create a boom or bring on a depression, to buy when stocks and commodities are cheap, and to sell when they are high. It is by these crooked manipu- lations that they and the memb ers of their race have acquired the greater part of the wealth of the world. The authority mentioned* repo rts that from 1817 to 1848 they made loans to various countries, aggregating 654,487,200 pounds. It reports also that they financed both Napoleon and the allies during the Napoleonic wars, and that they financed the American wars. \"But in the two great wars Jewish financiers played a considerable role owing doubtless to their European connec- tions. Hamym Solomon in the revolutionary war, while Selig- man Brothers and Speyer & Company financed the North and and Messrs. Erlanger the South in the great civil war. More recently, in the great development of railway finance the firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Company have taken a prominent part.\" It will shock the American pe ople to lear n that Hamyn Solomon whom we have regarded as a revolutionary hero, was the agent of Rothschild, and that Rothschild financed both sides of the American revolution and th e civil war. This is true to form. They acknowledge allegian ce to no country; they are out for the money, and it matters not how or where they get it; they wish to destroy all governments in orde r to establish their own, and their method is to promote and finance wars. It was stated by the Russian Major General, Count Cherep- Spiridovich, that the Rothschild family fortune in 1925 was $300,000,000,000, and that they made $100,000,000,000 of that sum out of the late world wa r, now called World War I.** This appears to be a very co nservative estimate. We have had a number of minor wars si nce that (late and two major depressions, viz., the disaster of 1929-1930 and the Roosevelt debacle of 1937, as a result of whic h stocks have fluctuated vio- lently in value. It is likely that the Rothschild family fortune is now in the neighborhood of $5 00,000,000,000, which is about twice the value of the wealth of all the people of the United States. The aggregate wealth of the present se veral hundred mem- bers of the family is only a matter of conjecture fo r it is kept as a sacred, profound secret.

It is the history of the Rothschild family that all of its mem- bers conceal their wealth in every possible way. This is done not only in pursu ance of the will of the founder of the fortune, but also to enable them to accomp lish their purposes as set forth in the protocols. It is estimated that the Jews have absorbed four-fifths of the wealth of Germany, Austria, Poland, and Czecho Slovakia, and more than one-half of that of England, France, and Italy. They practically own the banks, railways, steel and munition plants of these countries, to sa y nothing of the Press and other minor industries. They undoubtedly own approxima tely one-half of the wealth of America. With one or two possible ex ceptions they own the huge New York banks (which im plies the control of the New York Federal Reserve Bank), the insurance companies, the rail- roads, 70% of the steel and munition industries, 80% of the metropolitan press, the news and advertising agencies, the cin- ema, and 80% of the radio broadcasting companies. Wherever there is a monopoly a Jew will lik ely be found in control of it. J. P. Morgan & Company, with assets of $640,000,000, about one-half of which is cash and the other one-half tax exempt bonds, has always been regarded as a Gentile firm that was prac- tically owned and controlled by the Morgan family. The recent testimony taken by the Temporary National Economic Commit- tee discloses* the fact that J. P. Morgan only holds 9.1% int- erest in that firm; it also discloses that H. B. Davison had only 1.2%, George Whitney 1.9%, and that the other partners had interests of from 1/10 of 1% up to 6.1%, with the exception of the Chas. W. Steele Estate an d Thos. W. Lamont who held 36.6% and 34.2% respectively. J. P. Morgan is a man of great wealth; Thos. W. Lamont has never been regarded as a very rich man, and Chas. W. Steele was unknown to the public. In proportion to their interest in the Morgan firm they are du e to be more than three times as wealthy as J. P. Morgan. It is not likely that Lamont and Steele own in their own right the percentages as shown. It is probable that these respective inte rests are held in trust for the *\"Verbatim Record of the Proceedings of the Temporary Na- tional Economic Committee,\" Vol. X, No. 9, p. 262, Washing- ton, D.

Morgan & Company is but a Roths- child \"front.\" If true, it explai ns the fact that there is never any competition between Morg an & Company and Kuhn, Loeb & Company; on the other hand, there is always the closest co- operation. It is a circumstance worthy of note that the Temporary Na- tional Economic Committee has not investigated the firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Company and that th is firm was not investigated by the former senate investigating committee. Is it only an ac- cidental circumstance that Kuhn, Loeb & Co. are always left out of the investigations? This firm is the author of most of the devilment and we are entitled to know about its secret operations, such as the financing of Lenin and Trotzsky. The firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Co mpany is reported to be a Rothschild firm, owned \"lock, stock and barrel\" by the Roths- child interest. An investigation of this firm will no doubt re- veal that fact; it will no doubt reveal the further fact that its capital is largely cash and tax exempt bonds. The Rothschilds appear to be willing, in order to appease the public demands for information, to sacrifice the bank wherein they have only a 70% interest, and to make it the \" goat\" for public investigations. It appears from the former senate committee investigation that neither J. P. Morgan nor Thos. W. Lamont pay any income taxes. They adopt the scheme of selling securities at a loss just before the first of January to fr iends or relative s, which losses are offset against their profits, with the result th at they have no profits. It is likely that the me mbers of the Kuhn-Loeb firm do likewise. With the Gentiles payi ng income taxes and the Jews owning tax exempt bonds and dodging them, it will not be long until they absorb the greater part of the wealth of the country— if they have not already done so. There are many other rich Jews in addition to the Roths- childs, but the huge Rothschild fortune represents the greater part of the wealth of all the Jews of the world. The authority mentioned says: \"The Rothschilds were not without competitors; other Jewish families, the Lazards, Sterns, Speyers, and Seligmans adopted the Rothschild plan.\"* The \"Rothschild plan\" referred to was to establish private branch banks in the capitals of Europe and America with some *Jewish Ency.

The Mighty Rothschild Power \"Therefore we must not stop at bribery, deceit and treach- ery when they should serve towards the attainment of our end. In politics one must know how to seize the property of others without hesitation if by it we secure submission and sov- ereignty.\"—From Protocol 2. The first manifestation of the power of this concentrated wealth was to free the Jews from the bondage in which they had been held by the vari ous governments of Europe. When Wil- liam of Hesse placed his money in the hands of Mayer Amschel Rothschild the Jews were without the privilege of citizenship in Germany and all other countries, and were subject to all man- ner of burdensome taxes. It is said that they were the unofficial tax gatherers for the British king s during the rei gn of the Nor- man monarchy—the Jews squeezed the people and the kings squeezed the Jews. The historian Reeves graphically states the achievements of the Rothschild fortune as follows : \"Little could Mayer Amschel have anticipated *** that his sons would in after years co me to exercise such an un- bounded sway that the peace of nations would depend upon their nod; that the powerful control they exercised on the European money markets would enable them to pose as the arbiters of peace and war, sin ce they could at their pleasure withhold or furnish the pecuniary means required to carry on a campaign. \"But this, incredible as it may seem, was what their vast influence, combined with their enormous wealth and unlimited credit, enabled them to do, for no firms existed strong enough to oppose them for any length of time, or rash enough to take up a business which the Rothsc hilds had refused. To reach this exalted position Mayer Amschel and his sons required the co-operation of the States, but, when once he had climbed over their backs and reached the height of his ambition, he was independent of all aid and could act with the greatest freedom, whilst the States remained in a suppliant attitude at his feet.\"** This power brought about the establishment of the gold standard, first in the British Empire and then in other coun- tries, as stated in a succeedi ng chapter of this volume. They acquired the controlling interest in the Bank of England for which the late Lord Rothschild acted as gold agent and gover- **\"The Rothschilds,\" by John Reeves, p. 104-105."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"nor. The Bank of England is one of their many \"fronts.\" They no doubt have the control ling interest in most of the other cen- tral banks of issue. In strict keeping with the s ecrecy, which has been one of the cardinal principles of the Ro thschild rulers from the begin- ning, the Bank of En gland refuses to reveal its stockholders. There have been many investigations which have sought to gain this information, among others a direct order of Parliament, but it has never been disclosed. It is my information that the ownership of the other banks of i ssue of Europe is also kept a profound secret. They sent one of the Rothschi ld agents, Paul Warburg, as their representative to America just prior to World War I, to change our banking systems. Th ey knew that we would acquire the greater part of the gold of the world in payment of our ex- ports and they wanted to steriliz e this gold in order to control our economy and that of other c ountries. Under the pretense of organizing a credit expanding system to meet the demands of commerce, they in fact organized a credit contracting system to hold it in leash and to increa se the power and value of money. Through their ownership and co ntrol of their Morgan & Co., and Kuhn, Loeb & Co., private banks, they own and control the principal New York national banks and trust companies, and through them own and control the New York Federal Re- serve Bank. This branch of th e Federal Reserve System accord- ing to a recent statement has resources of $10,035,211,000 as against the resources of the other eleven F. R. banks of $11,- 744,034,000. It has gold certificat es of $8,934,442,00 0 as against the gold certificates of the othe r eleven F. R. banks of $10,- 094,036,000. According to pro-Jewish Senato r Carter Glass this gold be- longs to the certificate holders. It should be obs erved that the United States government issued gold certificates for the gold held by foreigners and the Reserve banks but did not issue such certificates for gold held by other banks or individuals; they received Federal Reserve Bank no tes which are withdrawable and subject to cancellation at the pleasure of the Federal Re- serve management. The explanation is simple: Such certificates if issued to individuals and banks generally in the United States would be in circulation and therefore enhance the value of property and"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"42 service and would cheapen money, but the certificates issued to the Federal Reserve Banks are lock ed in their vaults and there- by kept out of circulation, and the certificates issued to foreign- ers are sent out of the country. The Rothschilds, through the Sassoons (one of the female branches of their family), own and control the banks of China and India. They also own, c ontrol and operate the immensely profitable, illicit opium trade. A number of rich Catholics undertook to organize a com- petitor bank to rival the Rothsc hild power. I have been unable to discover when this enterprise was launched, but it was some- time about 1830. The Rothschilds crushed it. The Jewish En- cyclopedia admits that \"Following the failure of the Catholic bank, Union Gen- erals, leaving the Rothschilds still more absolutely the undis- puted leaders of French finance, but leaving also a legacy of hatred which had much influence on the growth of the anti- Semitic movement in France.\"* It says further: \"It is a somewhat curious sequel to the attempt to set up a Catholic competitor to the Rothschilds that at the present time (1905) the latter are the guardians of the papal treas- ure.\"** If this latter statement is tr ue the Rothschilds control in addition to their own fortune the immense liquid resource of the Catholic Church, which is se cond only to the Rothschilds' in wealth and power. It is proba bly not literally true since the private banking firm did not do commercial banking. It is likely that the papal treasure is depos ited with the Bank of England or some other bank \"front,\" but even so it contributes to the Rothschild power. It should be observed from the above quotation that the Rothschilds brought on a major depression which provoked an- ti-Semitism. I identify this as the catast rophe of 1839-1840, known as the \"hungry forties,\" wh ich our American historians have wrongfully ascribed to the veto of the charter of the Sec- ond Bank of the United States by Andrew J ackson in 1836. The next major depression in this country and throughout the world was in 187 3—\"the crime of '73.\" This wa s brought about by the demonetization of si lver. The Rothschilds had al- ready brought about the demonetization of silver in Germany ** Jewish Ency. Vol. 2, p. 497."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"as a part of their plan to \"fac ilitate the payment of the French indemnity to Germany,\" but it was necessary to the perfection of this plan that the gold standard be established in America. Through bribery, they caused to be clandestinely inserted a clause in the Coinage Act of 1873 that demonetized silver. The next major depression in America and th roughout the world was the panic of 1893 wh ich was brought about by the competition between th e Jewish House of Rothschild and the Jewish rival firm of Baring Br others. The ruler of the Roths- childs determined to crush th e Baring firm. The Jewish Ency- clopedia says of this operation: \"Similarly it is stated that the financial crisis of Germany and Austria (and America and th e world) was also a source of anti-Semitism because the shrewdness of the Jewish bankers had forseen the crash and they were enabled to evade it.\"* The Jews are always able to foresee and evade these depres- sions because they create them. Th ey not only evade these crises but they sell th eir securities in advance of them an d buy them back when values have been de stroyed, at a fraction of their former worth, and thereby make immense profits. It is by the repetition of this process from pa nic to panic that they have so rapidly acquired the wea lth of the world. Th e Jews do not lose on a panic, for the word is passe d down when it is to happen. They usually profit by it; a panic is their rich harvest. The next major panic was that of 1907 which the Roths- child controlled banks created by refusing to pay their custo- mers and their bank correspon dents the money due them and which was held on deposit. They simply coldly and brutally said to the other bankers having depos its with them: We cannot and will not pay you your money, and you must take care of your own customers the best way you can. This resulted in all the banks throughout the country cl amping down on their customers and refusing to pay them their m oney, which in turn resulted in checking all commercial enterprise s and a great fall in the wage and price level and a disastrous panic. It resulted also in the peopl e and the bankers getting to- gether for the purpose of organi zing a currency and credit ex- panding system to prevent a r ecurrence of such a panic. And worst of all the outcome was that the Rothschilds organized this system for us and created one that they coul d manipulate in *Vol. 2, p. 493."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"44 bringing about future panics a nd through which th ey could fix and regulate the wage and price level. That system has been re- sponsible for the depressions of 1 920, 1930 and the present Roose- velt depression of 1937 (still w ith us now, in 1940) which re- sulted in the \"New Deal\" and general bankruptcy. We have had these depressions so frequently and regularly that we have come to regard them as natural phenomena. There are economists who a ttempted to predict them. They usually occur about every ten years, but F. D. Roosevelt was a little im- patient to put over his \"New Deal\" and his communistic pro- gram, and he brought the last one on us ahead of time in order to complete the job which he star ted in 1933. They have all been manipulated, and for the same pur pose, viz., thievery and rob- bery and to establish the Kingdom of Judah throughout the world. As cruel and destructive as these panics are, they are not as bad as war. The Rothschild power was responsible for World War I and for the presen t world war, as will be shown later in this volume. They have been responsible fo r most of the wars that have occurred within the la st 150 years. Th ey usually fi- nance both sides of these wars, not becaus e they are interested in either side winning but because wars are demoralizing and destructive to the Gentiles and because they bring the Jews nearer their ultimate goal, viz., rulers of the world. Wars are their shortest and quickest route to the throne. The accumulation of compound intere st is entirely too slow for them. The robbery of the peop le through thei r manipulation of money and credit, as effective as it is, is also too slow. War, with all of its attendant human mi sery, is their su rest and best route—and so we have wars and will continue to have them so long as this power dominates the world. In 1844 \"Sidonia\" (Rothschild) said, in \"Coningsby\": \"No penal laws, no physical tortures, can effect that a superior race should be absorbed in an inferior, or be destroyed by it. The mixed persecuting races disappear; the pure per- secuted race remains . . . \"The first Jesuits were Jews; that mysterious Russian di- plomacy which so alarms Western Europe is organized and principally carried on by Jews; that mighty revolution which is at this moment preparing in Germany ... is entirely de- veloping under the auspices of Jews, who almost monopolize the professorial chairs of Germany.\""},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"45 \"Sidonia\" further says: \"I had on my arrival (at St. Petersburg) an interview with the Russian Minister of Finance, Count Cancrin; I be- held the son of a Lithuanian Jew . . . I had an audience on my arrival at Madrid with the Spanish minister; I beheld one like myself, the son of a Nuovo Christiano, a Jew of Aragon. In consequence of what transpir ed at Madrid I went straight to consult the President of th e French Council; I beheld the son of a French Jew . . . We fixed on Prussia . . . Count Arnim entered the cabinet, and I beheld a Prussian Jew. So you see, my dear Coningsby, that the world is governed by very different personages to what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes.\"** If Sidonia should now, in 19 40, make the rounds of the capitals of Europe, he would find a considerable change in the situation. He would fi nd the Jews struggling to maintain their political power and their sacrosan ct gold standard, using Gen- tile \"fronts\" and Gen tile armies and navi es for that purpose. He would find that Hitler had driven the Jews from the cap- itols of Germany, Austria, C zecho Slovakia, Poland, Denmark, Norway, Holland, Belgium, France, and Roumania—and that he was engaged in a struggle to drive them from England. He would find that Mussolini had driven them from Italy, Albania, and Ethiopia. But he would still fi nd them at th e helm of the British Government-—and I regret to say the United States Gov- ernment also. A country engaged in war must buy from other countries many products required for its prosecution. That requires money that is acceptable to the seller, which has heretofore meant gold, because the moneys of the prin cipal exporting countries have been based on gold. It has theref ore been necessary to apply to the Rothschilds for this firm has, until recent years, been in con- trol of the gold of the world, ei ther directly or through their banks. They have th erefore had the power to make or unmake wars. It is the universal gold standard coupled with their uni- versal press ownership and coupl ed with the se crecy of their operations that have made them masters of the world. **\"Coningsby\" by Benjamin Disraeli, p. 207-209."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"VIII. The \"Kept\" Press \"In the hands of the States of today there is a great force that creates the movement of th ought in the people, and that is the Press.

It is in the Press that the triumph of freedom of speech finds its incarnation. But the goyim States have not known how to make use of this force; and it has fallen into our hands. Through the Press we have gained the power to influ- ence while remaining ourselves in the shade; thanks to the Press we have got the gold in our hands, notwithstanding that we have had to gather it out of oceans of blood and tears. But it has paid us, though we have sacrificed many of our people. Each victim on our side is worth in the sight of God a thous- and goyim.\"—From Protocol 2. It is true that the Press in the \"goyim States\" has fallen into the hands of the Jews; it is also tr ue that thro ugh the Press the Jews have \"gained the power to influence while remaining in the shade.\" It is also true that they have \"got the gold\" in their hands and that they have \"had to gather it out of oceans of blood and tears\"—but not their blood and tears; they have gath- ered it from the \"blood and tears\" of the gullible and despised goyim. The only method by which they could have gained this gold, through the Pres s and through \"blood and tears\" is by creating wars, which the Press ha ve helped creat e through their propaganda. It is difficult to prove to what extent the Jews are directly interested in the Press, for they conceal it. They are reputed to own 100% of the metropolita n newspapers of both England and France, and likewi se 100% of the ne ws and advertising agencies and the cinema of these two countries. In America the ownership is not so complete. It is estimated that the Jews own 80 % of the metropolitan press and 100% of the news and advertising agencies and cinema. Fortunately, their ownership of the small da ily papers and country papers appears to be negligible; their influence with these papers is through their news agencies fro m which the country press ob- tain news, and their advertisin g agencies thro ugh which they obtain advertisements.

They acquired the very in formative and useful \"Literary Digest\" and junked it, and instead gave us the jazzy \"Time\" and \"Life.\" They are reputed to have acquired the \"Saturday Even- ing Post\" and perverted its hi gh standards and principles. The Post was founded by Benjamin Franklin and it has always been free and independent and bold in its editorial ex- pression. It was an outstanding critic of the New Deal and the perversion of the government by the Roosevelt Administration, but it has been silenced by its present Jew owners; they have put it to sleep permanently. Ther e is not now in this broad land of ours a single periodical or metropolitan newspaper that stands for constitutional government as it has been handed down to us by our ancestors. The Press has degenerated u nder Jewish control and in- fluence into lying propaganda agencies whose chief mission ap- pears to be to deceive and to befuddle the people. In Protocol 12 the Elders of Zion say of the Press: \"Not a single announcement will reach the public without our control. Even now this is already being attained by us inasmuch as all news items are received by a few agencies, in whose offices they are focused from all parts of the world. These agencies will then be alr eady entirely ours and will give publicity only to what we dictate to them.\" It is literally true that all \"news items are received by a few agencies.\" It is also true that these agencies are \"entirely ours.\" It is also true that they only give publicity to \"what we dictate to them.\" It is also true that all of the news that reaches us is under their control. This protocol was promulgated prior to 1905. The situa- tion there described is precisely the cpndition that now prevails. We are getting only such war news as they choose to give us, and they choose to give us only th at which will favor England be- cause they (the Jews) are waging this war through Britain for the Jews and their restoration of Poland and C zecho Slovakia and for the maintenance of their gold standard and their power.

There is reason to believe that the people of the British Em- pire, like the people of America, don't want war but it is the Jews and their Press that are demanding it, a nd through their control of the government are waging it. In the Funeral Oration of Rabbi Reichhorn pronounced in Prague in 1869 over the tomb of Grand Rabbi Simeon-ben- Ihuda, he said: \"The other great power is The Press. By repeating with- out cessation certain ideas, the Press succeeds in the end in having them accepted as actualities. The Theatre renders us analogous services. Everywhere the Press and the Theatre obey our orders.\" That furnishes an explanation of all of this war propa- ganda to which we are now being subjected. It will be observed that by repeating a falsehood from time to time they say it will be \"in the end accepted as an actuality.\" We constantly have before us the proof of that statement. Every member of the Congre ss who has any knowledge of the money question knows that the only remedy for the existing depression is what the Jews an d their columnists and \"kept\" Press call inflation; they know th at inflation means high prices and wages and cheap money, but th ere is not one of them who will dare publicly announce that he stands for inflation—not one. On the other hand he will hold his hands up in holy horror against it, will talk about its abuses in Germany, France, etc. Why? Simply because the Jews have held inflation up to scorn so often and ridiculed it so repeatedly that it has become anathema, and it is accepted as an \"actuality\" that any sort of inflation would be a great misfortune; this, despite the fact that they know there can be no relief from deflation without it. It is fear of the Jew press. Why have the Jews acquired the Press and other publicity agencies in America and other co untries unless it is for the pur- poses as stated in the protocols?

He can' t get to first base without it.

The result is al so that con- gress and the President are subser vient to Jewish control. The result is also that no politician w ill dare criticize the Jewish race, and that all with one accord praise it and de nounce racial preju- dice.

I will shake down corruption from its height, and bury it beneath the ruins of the abuses it was meant to shelter.\" In Protocol 7 attached as an Appendix, they say, \"We must compel the governments of the goyim to take action in the direc- tion favoured by our widely conc eived plan, already approaching the desired consummation,\" by th at \"great power, the press, which with a few exceptions that may be disregarded, is already entirely in our hands.\" That is precisely what they are now do- ing. They are seeking to compel all governments to join in their \"widely conceived plan\" of a universal war. Through the \"oceans of blood and tears\" of such a war they will again gather much gold and may seize polit ical power and establish their \"King- Despot of the blood of Zion.\" We have the evidence here before our very eyes and yet we refuse to see and recognize it, and the danger of it.

They say they have acquired it \"to compel the governments of the g oyim in the direction favoured by our widely conceive d plan;\" and they ar e using it for that purpose. They say that through it and through \"oceans of blood and tears\" they have acquired the gold of the world, and that is true.

The columnist, Boake Carter, stated in one of his syndi- cated articles that \"recently a considerable block of stock was opened to public sale by the Ch icago Daily News (Col. Knox's paper). Among the largest buyers was Kuhn, Loeb & Co.\" This reveals one of the methods by whic h the Jews have obtained con- trol of the press. The Jews also own the International Paper Co., which extends credit to many newspapers and owns the stock and bonds of many of them. Whenev er a leading newspaper gets in financial distress or comes on the market, the Jews grab it up. It is a significant fact that every Jew columnist is for war against Germany and every Gentile columnist is against it; it is also significant that every Jew congressman is for war, and the Gentile congressmen are pr actically unanimously against it; it is also significant that the city Jew press is for war and the country Gentile press against it. We Gentiles have not yet forgotten the ingratitude shown us by the Allies following World War I. They said that we did not win it, that they did. They said also that they were fighting for us and that we should bear the ex penses of the war and they re- fused to pay the loans made them since the war, on that flimsy *R. E.

Well, now \"Uncle Shylock\"—or at least the Gentile pa rt of him—wants to decline to underwrite the present war. He disclaims all interest in it or resp onsibility for it.

It may be true, as the Jews cl aim, that they originated ma- sonry. There are many signs and symbols of masonry, as we Americans know it, that indicate it, but our masonry, as has heretofore been pointe d out, is entirely separate and different from theirs; theirs is a secret clannish political agency to pre- serve their solidarity, to act as a unit, and to carry into effect the orders of their rulers. The B'nai B'rith appears to ha ve been founded in America and to be the American branch of the Jewish continental ma- sons; there is no occasion here for another openly avowed be- nevolent masonic order since the Jews are permitted to join the American masons. \"What is the B'nai B'rith?\" \"An international secret Jewish 'masonic order' known among the tribes as 'Sons of the Covenant' (circumcision), of which Henry Monsky of Chicago is President. It was founded in New York in 1843.

The Nihilists of Russ ia was reputed to be another branch through which they murder ed the Czars of Russia and the rulers of other countries. It was probably the Continen tal Masons who selected Her- schel Grynszpan to murder Von Rath, the German attache in France, for the Jews have made a hero of him; they have throughout the world applauded this dastardly act, raised huge sums of money and employed ma ny lawyers for his defense. The Jewish French government never arraigned him for trial but the present government will like ly do so. He proposed to vol- unteer to fight for France, whic h was headlined in the Jewish press all over the world. Adolf Hitler accepted this political assassination as being a racial murder in pursuance of their racial plans and accordingly imposed a fine of $400,000,000 on the Jewish race in Germany. It is estimated that when th e Jews obtained control of the Russian government they put to death 3,000,000 of the best and most important Gentile citizens of the Russian Empire, and later starved to death more than 20, 000,000 of them. When the Jew Bela Kuhn (Aaron Cohn) obtained control of the Hungarian gov- ernment, his first act was to murder 20,000 of the leading Gen- tiles of that coun try. It is reported that 700,000 Hungarians were killed during his 133 days of rule of Hungary and imme- diately preceeding and following it.* The same thing occurred in Germany. Adolf Hitler is au- thority for the statement that between 4,000 and 5,000 of the best people of Germany were pr omptly executed when the Jews obtained control of the government. This is all in pursuance of their protocols and their Tal- mud and their communist code. Their Talmud teaches them that \"the life of a goi and all his physical powers belong to a Jew,\" and their protocols tell them that death is the \"inevitable end for all and that it is better to bring that end nearer to those who hinder our affairs than to ourselves—the founders of this affair.\" The Jews are descended from a nomadic Asiatic people who banded themselves together like packs of wolves, and roamed the plains of Palestine, Persia , Arabia and adjoining countries, and pillaged the people of those countries.

The present Jew is the product of his ancestors; he has in- herited many of their characteristics. His civilization is but veneer, and a thin one at that. He ill-conceals his vanity and egotism and deceitfulness and cruelty and grasping nature. Murder is difficult to prove at best, and it is impossible when it is done in such manner that \"none save the brotherhood can even have a suspicion of it—not even the victims of our death sentence; they all die when requir ed, as if from a normal kind of illness.\" This can explain th e alleged murder of President Harding; and also the alleged mu rder of the late, blind Senator Schall of Minnesota who was an able and outstanding critic of the present Jew administration and \"Jew Deal.\" He was run over on the street by a \"hit and run\" driver whos e identity has never been discovered. It may also explain the alleged assassina- tion of Senator Bronson Cutting w ho was also an able critic of the \"New Deal,\" and likewise gu ilty of \"hinderi ng our affairs.\" He was killed in a plane crash. It was stated at the time that the plane had been tampered with and that an investigation would be made, but that was the end of it. We have had a singular fa tality among our Presidents.

Jules Guitau, nationa lity unknown; McKinney by the Jew Leon Czolgosz; and probably Harding. During the years since the civil war the Jews have financed the campaigns of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt, and have consequently contributed very largely to the election of two of the three democratic presidents since the war. The Jews have not so far as known, financed and brought about the election of any of the republican presidents except Hoover,—and perhaps Coolidge who had his Je w sponsor, Stearn. Of the other five elected republican presidents three of them were murdered; a strange fatality of the non-Je wish republican presidents.

There is, however, at least one murder of a promin ent senator who \"hindered their affairs\" that is definitely k nown—viz., the late Senator Huey Long of Louisiana who was shot down in the Louisiana State House. His friend, Governor A llen, who succeeded him and who was investigating his death, himself died \"as from a normal kind of illness\"—suddenly and mysteriously. We also know that prior to Senator Long's de ath the Jew- ish federal governmen t refused federal aid to the people of Louisiana, for relief or in a ny other form. Immediately after he was murdered the federal treasury was opened up and money flowed into Louisiana. It ha s been aptly called \"the second Louisiana purchase.\" At the time of Senator Long's murder a number of federal indictments were pend ing against Sol Weiss, his Jew treasurer, and other leaders in the Long po litical machine; soon after his death these indictments were di smissed. These men were evi- dently promised security and fe lt secure, because their miscon- duct afterward became so flagrant that they were re-indicted and have recently been tried and convicted. It has been frequent ly stated in the press that the killing of Senator Long was an \"inside job.\" It is probable that the dis- missal of these indictments and his murder were arranged be- forehand. He was killed by a man by the name of Weiss, sup- posedly a Jew and a relative of Sol Weiss, his treasurer. Henry Ford first opened the eyes of the people of America to the Jew menace. He caused to be published three volumes en- titled \"The International Jew,\" which revealed the fact that the Jews are the real financial power that controls America. He also published \"The Dearborn Independent,\" wh ich was esti- mated to have a circulation of almost a million, and which in- formed its readers about the machinations of the Jews. Among other things, it atta cked the Jew Aaron Sh apiro because of his graft in connection with the orga nization of the farmer co-op- eratives. Shapiro filed suit agains t Mr. Ford for libel for sev- eral million dollars, his attorneys being the Jew firm of Unter- meyer & Marshall, New York lawyers for the Rothschild int- erest. Late one night while returning home from his office, a \"hit and run\" driver sideswiped Mr. Ford's car and forced it down a steep embankment and he was se riously but not fatally injured. "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"58 Shortly thereafter he evidently compromised with the Jews on the basis of discontinuing the publication of The Dearborn Inde- pendent.

We can not know whether Mr. Ford sa ved his life by this settlement but we do know that he saved hi mself from a lot of Jewish per- secution. Martin Luther is credited with saying that the Jews are \"liars, thieves, and murderers.\" They are taught to be by both their Talmud and their protocols. It is a terrific indictment against the Jewish race. It is undoubtedly true of the \"Learned Elders of Zion.\" We prefer to be lieve that the Jews with whom we come in daily contact are diff erent. But we can not close our eyes to the disagreeable fact that this indictment is confirmed by the Talmud, the protocols and th e history of the Jewish race. We have just witnessed another tragic death of a great American Senator who \"hindere d our affairs,\" viz: Senator Lundeen of Minnesota. He was mu rdered in the same way they murdered Senator Cutting. They were both travelling in air- planes out of Washington, and in both cases the plane developed engine trouble a short distance out of the city. There were other passengers on both planes (24 on the last) but that small cir- cumstance was a matter of no consequence to the murderers. These are murders that appear to be from a \"normal kind of accident,\" and they are well hi dden, for there wa s no one left in either case to tell the story. They are not \"normal\" for the Cutting and Lundeen plane crashes are the only accidents of that character that have occurred in the fifteen years of passenger air travel. There are not many senators of the Lundeen type left. Four of them have met violent deaths, viz: Senators Long, Schall, Cutting, and now Senator Lundeen. And one has been \"purged\" by the lavish use of money, viz: Senator Holt of West Virginia."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"59 X. World War I \"We shall force the Christians into wars by exploiting their pride and their stupidity. They will massacre each other and clear the ground for us .\"—From Funeral Oration of Rabbi Reichhorn. Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany wa s a very vain man who loved publicity and imagined himself an autocrat, but in fact he was only a figurehead, as King George VI of England now is, and as most of the European monarchs are now and were at that time. The Jews encouraged him in this delusion and fed his vanity, while they operated his government. The important ministers of Germany—those that really ran the government—were all Jews. Bethmann Holweg, chan- cellor and spokesman, was a descendant of the Rothschilds, Wal- ter Rathneau, treasurer, and Felix Warburg, head of the spy system, together with five othe r members of the Kaiser's cab- inet, were Jews. The Jews in 1914 were more comp letely in con- trol of the governments of Europe than they were in 1844 when Disraeli's \"Sidonia\" (Rothschild ) visited the va rious capitals of Europe. Sidonia then with wo rds of prophecy visioned the world war: \"That mighty revolution which is at this moment prepar- ing in Germany ... is entirely developing under the auspices of Jews who almost monopolize the professorial chairs of Germany.\" It was, however, a world war that the Jews developed, and not a mere revolution. The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand and his wife was given as the excu se for it but that was not the cause; it was only a pretext. Th ere was no redress or attempted redress of this assassination; th e Duke and Duchess were soon forgotten. The real cause of the war was Jewish ambition and avarice; it had been planned for a long period of time; they merely seized upon this circumstance to fool the gullible goyim. We are all presumed to intend the consequences of our acts. We judge the cause by the effect . The effect of the war was the League of Nations, the estab lishment of the gold standard throughout the world, and Palestin e for the Jews. This would probably have been th e effect of the war if Germany had won, for the Jews even in that cas e would have written the peace treaty just as they did at the conclusion of the victory of the "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"60 Allies. The accomplishment of th ese three things was the pur- pose of World War I—and, with th e exception of Palestine, is the purpose of World War II. These things did not just happen by accident; they were all pre-arranged. The cunning of the Jew is uncanny. It is the result of centuries of imag ined superiority and suppression and scheming and nursed vengeance. The war-plotters knew in adva nce that practically all of Europe would be engulfed in Wo rld War I. They probably reck- oned that they would inveigle America into it. They did not care who won. They knew that th ey would write the peace treaty and gather in the spoils. The German government sought to alienate Russia from the Allies during World War I, and accomplished it through the Jews. The German Jew government furnished a trai n and trans- portation for Lenin and his gang through Germany to Moscow, and the Jews financed the enterprise. Among the Jews that put up the money were Paul Warbur g, governor of our Federal Re- serve System, and the Rothschild firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. These gentlemen now deny it. When thei r rascality is discovered the Jews always \"deny the allegation and defy the allegator.\" Father Coughlin made this charge in one of his radio ad- dresses and it was challenged by Kuhn, Loeb & Co. In a book entitled \"An Answer to Father Coughlin's Cr itics\" the truth of this charge has been estab lished beyond any reasonable doubt. This book further establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the Jews not only overthrew the Czarist government in Russia, but that they executed the Czar and his family, and established their own government in place of it. Of the 25 leaders of that revolution all of them were Jews except Lenin whose mother and wife are reputed to have been Jewesses—this would make him a hybrid and a \"Jew-in-law.\" The following are the names of the Jewish leaders of the Rus- sian revolution as appears from the American Official Services Report, Section III: Assumed Name Real Name Nationality Lenin Oulianow (Ulianoff) Russian* Trotsky (Trotzky) Bronstein Jewish Steckloff Nakhames  Jewish  *The present writer wishes to add that some authors are con- vinced that Lenin's mother was a Jewess."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"61 Martoff Zederbaum Jewish Zinovieff A p felbau m Jewish Kameneff Rosenfel d Jewish Dan Gourevitch ( Yurewitsch ) Jewish Ganetzk y Furstenber g J ewish Parvus Hel p fand Jewish Uritzk y Padomilsk y Jewish Larin  Lur g eJewish Bohrin N athansohn Jewish Martinoff Ziba r Jewish Bo g danoff Zilberstein Jewish Garin Garfeld Jewish Suchanoff Gime l Jewish Kairmelff Goldmann Jewish Sa g r ersk y Krochmann Jewish Kiazanoff Goldenbach Jewish Solutzeff Bleichmann Jewish Piatnitzk y Ziwin Jewish Axelro d Orthodo x Jewish Glasunoff Sehultze Jewish Zuriesain Weinstein Jewish La p insk y Lo e wensohn Jewish It appears that the Jews deceive the Russians as to their identity by adopting Russian name s, in the same way they de- ceive us by adopting English names. The Jewish Russian revoluti on occurred in 1917 when we were in World War I and Russia was our ally. Paul Warburg, Jacob Schiff and other members of the firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Co., were naturalized citizens of the United States and there- fore subject to prosecution for treason. They were guilty of high treason but the power of the Jew in our government at that time and since, was and is such that they have escaped the con- sequences of their crime. On the other hand, despite this treason- able conduct the Jews were given Palestine upon President Wil- son's insistence. It has taken 22 years to find out the whole story of our be- trayal into World War I. We are indebted to Senator Gerald P. Nye of North Dakota for diggi ng into the records and bring- ing to light the Balfour-Lansing correspondence by which Presi- dent Wilson is shown to have agreed to enter the war long prior to the sinking of the Lusitania. This correspondence , however, did not di sclose the real reason for our ac tion, the motive for Pres ident Wilson's change of front and how the change wa s brought about. In his tire- less effort to keep this countr y out of war, Senator Nye dis- "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"62 covered and revealed the truth, and the real reason for Presi- dent Wilson's change of front. Prior to these reve lations we thought we entered the war because of the sinking of the Lus itania and the violation of our rights as a neutral. That was the reason assigned by President Wilson in his dramatic message to Congress, but it was not the real reason, as conclusively shown by the Balfour-Lansing cor- respondence. It was only a pretext to secure the support of Con- gress and the people. There can be no doubt about the fact that prior to President Wilson's second election in 1916 he \"kept us ou t of the war.\" There can likewise be no doubt a bout the fact that he was re- elected upon that slogan. Why di d he change his position soon after his election? Why did he make an agreement with the British government to help the Allies? That has been, until now, an unexplained mystery The answer is, the Jew and Palestine. \"Believe it or not,\" President Wilson sacrificed 50,000 of the flower of our youth, caused 200,000 more to be ma imed and crippled, and gave $50,000,000,000 of our wealth, in order to restor e Palestine to the Jews—a small barren country that probably could have been bought for a billion dollars or le ss. Worse than that, he took us into the war for the purpose of treacherously taking the homeland from one of our own Allies, the Arabs, who were fighting side by side with our soldiers. Ne ver have a brave, confiding people been so treacherously double-crossed. In a speech in the Senate on April 25th, 1939,* Senator Nye said: \"There has been published a series of works under the title \"The Next War.' One of the volumes in this series is entitled 'Propaganda in the Next War.' This particular volume was written by one Sidney Rogerson. I have been unable to obtain any trace of his background or of his connections; but the editor-in-chief of all these work s, including\" the one entitled 'Propaganda for the Next War,' is a man whose name is rec- ognized the world over as an authority in Great Britain. He is none other than Capt. Liddell Hart, associated with the London Times, a writer and a military authority in Europe.\" The following are quotations from this authority: \"For some time the issue as to which side the United States would take hung in the balance, and the final result *See Congressional Record, 76th Congress, Vol. 84, No. 82, pages 6597-6604."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"63 was a credit to our propaganda (meaning the British propa- ganda) . . . \"There remain the Jews. It has been estimated that of the world Jew population of approximately 15,000,000, no fewer than 5,000,000 are in th e United States; 25% of the in- habitants of New York are Jews. During the Great War we bought off this huge American Jewish public by the promise of the Jewish National Home in Palestine, held by Ludendorff to be the master stroke of allied propaganda, as it enabled us not only to appeal to Jews in America but to Jews in Ger- many as well.\" They \"bought off th e huge American Je wish public\" with the promise of Palestine, and with them they bought the pow- erful metropolitan Jewish press and the Wilson Administra- tion. That is not my language, nor is it my assert ion; it is the language and the statement of fa ct of an eminent British au- thority writing for the benefit of the British public, and particu- larly for the British propagandist s of the \"next war\"—now in progress. He says of this Pr opaganda for the Next War, that we (the American people) have been \"fed up\" on atrocities and that this form of attack will not work next time and that they must adopt new methods. He says that we ar e an emotional, gullible people and that despite the fact that th ere is now some prejudice against the British Government because of its refusal to pay its debt to us, that we can again be worked provided the proper approach is used. He suggests the following: \"To persuade her (the United States) to take our part will be much more difficult, so difficult as to be unlikely to succeed. It will need a definite threat to America, a threat, moreover, which will have to be brought home by propaganda to every citizen, befo re the Republic will again take arms in an external quarrel . . . \"The position will naturally be considerably eased if Japan were involved, and this might and probably would bring America in without further ado. At any rate, it would be a natural and obvious object of our propagandists to achieve this, just as during the Great War they succeeded in em- broiling the United States with Germany. \"Fortunately with America, our propaganda is on firm ground. We can be entirely sincere, as our main plank will be the old democratic one. We must clearly enunciate our belief in the democratic form of government and our firm resolve to adhere to it. Our minor propaganda will aim at attaching the support of important sections, such as the Jews, probably by the declaration of a clear-cut policy in Pales-"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"tine, and of our intention, if victorious, to put an end to anti- Semitic persecutions; and of the Roman Catholic community in similar terms ... \"In the realm of the moving picture industry we may be able to depend on the natural bias of the United States film manufacturers in favor of Great Britain as opposed to Ger- many, Japan, or Italy, and on their command of the machin- ery of international film distri bution. This will be an asset both with the stock entertainment picture and the news reels.\" So their plan was to line up the Jews and \"Catholic com- munity\" by \"promising\" if victorious to \"put an end to anti- Semitic persecutions; and of the Roman Catholic community in similar terms.\" The Jews, the Je w press, the Jew cinemas, and the Jew President and his Jew administration, are already lined up; no promises or propaganda were needed for that purpose. But the protestant American has been badly burned, he has had enough of their wars, and it will be difficult to get him into another one by talk and propaganda—which they realize. They propose to appeal to hi s prejudices and fears by getting Japan in on the other side. The British Governme nt will prob- ably adopt this course and provoke Japan to war in order to obtain the more powerful s upport of the United States The President has dispatched the fleet to the Pacific Ocean. This is for the purpose of war with Japan: It can be for no other purpose. If Japan will only torpedo one of these boats, the Jewish press, the Jewish radio, and the Jewish cinema will do the rest. The Jew Admiral Taussig stated to a Congressional In- vestigating Committee that \"war with Japan is inevitable.\" The worst of it is that thes e slick Jew wa r-makers will probably themselves torpedo the boat and blame the Japs through their press, cinema, etc., and the result will be the same. We may fight, and investigate later, and may again learn the truth twenty years afterward. They also propose to appeal to us protestants on the \"old democratic plank\" that they are democracies and \"believe in the democratic form of government and our firm resolve to ad- here to it.\" To hell with such democracies!

The French Empire, with a Rothschild in her cabinet, and governed ordinarily by a bunch of Jews,—was also acquired by conquest, and is the third largest area in the world. The Jewish influence now governs the British Empire. They have many representa tives in the House of Commons through the Labor party. In th e House of Lords they predominate thru their purchase of tit les and intermarriag e with the nobility. Formerly a King selected and ap pointed his lords and nobles from his brave warriors and land ed aristocracy; now he sells these titles to his rich subjects who are principally Jews, and this is a source of considerable revenue to the Crown. The pres- ent heads of the Briti sh cabinet, viz., C hurchill, Eden, Cooper, et al., are all strongly pro-Jewish and are all intense haters of Hitler because he is anti-Semitic. America is not a democracy and never has been, and God forbid that it ever shall be. It is a republic whose powers are clearly defined by the Constitution. Referring to the propaganda by the British and German governments during th e first world war, the writer correctly observes: \"I repeat it is unt hinkable that such a dog-fight be- tween non-Americans will again be permitted in the United States.\" It is indeed \"unthi nkable,\" but such propaganda is nevertheless being carried on right now by the Jews in the newspapers and cinemas and over their radios . It should be suppressed even if we must close them all up. Senator Nye said of this book: \"I understand that this particular volume, Propaganda in the Next War, published last fall and placed in circulation, in- stead of having its circulation en larged, now is suffering at the hands of those who desire to re tire it from circulation. A few days ago I came on the floor of the Senate with the volume it- self. I am sorry I have not it with me today. I am told that it is the only copy of Propaganda in the Next War available in the United States. It can be had; I can borrow it again if there is cccasion and need for it in the Senate; but it is no longer easy to obtain. I wish the entire work might be read by every Member of the Senate.\" Apparently it is a semi-official book of the British govern- ment. The destruction of these copies of the book was probably by order of her Jew Secretary of War, Hore-Bel isha, or other Jewish \"Elders,\" following an ancient Jewish custom. That is what they did to the protocols and to Pinckney's diary and probably also to the Am erican Official Services Report mentioned above."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"66 XI. League of Nations \"By all these means we sha ll so wear down the goyim that they will be compelled to offer us international power of a nature that by its position will enable us without any violence gradually to absorb all the Stat e forces of the world and to form a Super-Government. In place of the rulers of today we shall set up a bogey which w ill be called the Super-Govern- ment Administration.\"—From Protocol 5. When World War I ended, the Rothschilds and their agents were there to administer upon the wreckage. \"E lder\" Bernard Baruch, who succeeded E. M. House as President Wilson's ad- visor, induced the Pres ident, contrary to all precedent and the advice of his cabinet, to attend the peace conference in France in person. \"Elder\" Baruch was, du ring the entire period of the war, Chairman of the War Industries Board which was invested with despotic author ity over the production a nd sale of every- thing. In his memoirs, Ike Hoover, Chief Usher at the White House during ten administrations , including the Wilson admin- istration, said: \"The President and Mrs. Wilson went to the country place rented by Mr. Baruch for lunch today (Sunday) and all of us scattered. The strange part is that each went alone, as if dodging the others. The fact is that we are all tired of looking at one another. At dinner time we had a good laugh when I charged them all with being bored with the others, and all manfully agreed.\"—Saturday Evening Post, July 7, 1934. Why should this wily Jewish ga mbler rent a house and make his headquarters near Versaill es during the peace conference, which gave birth to the League of Nations,? What interest had he in the League of Nations? The terms of the peace treaty and the League of Nations were ostensibly agreed upon an d fixed by Woodrow Wilson rep- resenting the United States Gove rnment, Lloyd George repre- senting the British Empire, and Georges Clemenceau represent- ing the French Empire,—but they we re in fact largely the work of men behind the scenes, viz., the \"King-Despot of the blood of Zion\" and his agents representing the Jewish race and money power. It is obvious that Baruch was then and is now the politi- cal representative of the Rothschilds in America. Ile was then President Wilson's adviser. "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"67 The Jew mentor of David Lloyd-George was Sir Philip A. G. D. Sassoon, Bart., a direct descendant of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, and a member of the British Privy Council. He served Lloyd-George during the peace conference as private secretary which enabled him to \"s it in\" on the se cret delibera- tions of the conferee s.** Jereboam Rothsc hild (Mandel) ap- pears to have held a similar position with Clemenceau. Baruch's position with Wilson was that of an intimate friend and adviser. I quote the magazine \"Time\" as authority for the statement that Georges Mandel, (Jeroboa m Rothschild), until recently France's Minister of the Interi or, was Clemenceau's \"right bower.\" It says: \"To the vital Ministry of the Interior, Premier Reynaud appointed energetic, 54-year-old Georges Mandel, till then Min- ister of Colonies. This was no new job for the sharp-nosed, stocky little Clemencist, who as the Tiger's chef de cabinet during the last war ran the country's domestic affairs and kept up civilian morale. Born Jer oboam Rothschild, Mandel has often been called Fran ce's Disraeli, is a super-politician in a country of politicians, lately showed in the Colonial (and Post Office) Ministry that he had lost none of the drive and admin- istrative flare that made him indispensable to Clemenceau. He was so close to the Premier that the Rabelaisian Tiger once quipped: \"Quand je pete, Mandel pue.\"* We can now properly appraise this treacherous, criminal peace treaty, out of which has gr own the present war. It was not Wilson who betrayed the German government by the promise of his Fourteen Points, nor Lloyd George who was false to the promises made the Arabs to induce them to enter the war. It was Jeroboam Rothschild, Sir Philip Sassoon, and Bernard Baruch. Wilson, Lloy d George and Clemen ceau are culpable only to the extent that they ac ted in obedience to a power that they did not dare oppose. These three Jews, representi ng the money power of the Rothschild family, determined the essential provisions of the infamous peace treaty. They established the International Labor Board; they made provision fo r the Reparations Commission and the Brussels Financial Conference; they gave Palestine to the Jews; and established without our membership the League of Nations and the World Court. It was our refusal to join that **Congressional Record, Aug. 21, 1940, p. 16368. *\"Time,\" May 27, 1940, p. 34."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"68 prevented the consummation of their grandiose elaborate ma- chine for the govern ment of the world. These three Jews are responsible for the abandonment of President Wilson's fourteen point s and for the flagrant viola- tion of the promises upon whic h Germany laid down her arms. If President Wilson's pledges ha d been observed we would have no World War II. Perhaps if we had joined the League of Na- tions there would be none, for we would be the subjects of this \"King-Despot\" who would rule us with an iron hand. They then and there sowed the seeds that have germinated into the present war. Jeroboam Rothschild (Mandel) was a member of the Rey- naud cabinet and resigned with him and fled with him when France refused to be \"merged\" into the British Empire but decided instead to surr ender. The people of France now appear to realize, according to the press reports, that they are the vic- tims of these warmongers. It will be recalled that on hi s return to America President Wilson started upon a speaking t our to convert the American people to the League of Nations and that it was during this cam- paign that, fortunatel y for America, he had his break down; otherwise he might have put it ov er. It should also be recalled that due to the opposi tion of Senators Bo rah, Johnson, Lodge, Reed, and other stalwart American s, this grandiose scheme was defeated. It should al so be recalled with pride that there was enough Americanism left in the Senate, led by Borah and John- son and Huey Long, to defeat our entry into the League of Na- tions through its back door, the so-called \"World Court,\" during the Hoover administration and ag ain during the Roosevelt ad- ministration, despite the powerful pressure brought to bear on the Senate by both of these presidents. The League of Nations scheme did not originate with Presi- dent Wilson. He made no such claim. Its precise origin is unknown, but the Jews claim cred it for it. It is no doubt their baby, for it has all the ear-m arks of their craftiness. Its pretended purposes was to form a league or coalition of all the nations of the earth for th e purpose of preventing future wars, but that was not its real purpose. It was a slick scheme to establish a Super-Government to which all the nations of the earth would be subordinate and subservient. There was no authority under our constituti on for our gov-"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"69 eminent to become a party to it, even though its purpose had been a worthy one. That small detail, however, \"cut no ice\" with the \"Elders\" and apparently none with President Wilson. The London Daily Mail said of it that it is \"the most elaborate sham which history has yet perpetrate d.\" It has now discharged all of its employees and closed up its shop. The peace conference appoin ted Gustav Cassel, a noted monetary authority of Stockho lm, Sweden, to advise them, which he did. He wrote for that purpose two memoranda (pub- lished in his book entitled \"Wor ld's Monetary Problems,\") in which he set forth logically and conclusively that it was abso- lutely necessary to maintain high prices and wages and cheap money in order to enable the people and nations of the world to pay their debts. He showed convin cingly that the restoration of the gold standard wa s impossible, that it would bankrupt the people and governments of all countries, create great distress and unrest and probably lead to war. In the face of the solemn warning prepared especially for the Brussels Financial Conference, this conference decreed the return of the gold st andard, with its chea p prices and wages. Professor Cassel told in words of prophecy precisely the results that have since happened. The sh rewd monetary experts of the Brussels Conference knew what would happen without such ad- vice and they intended the very consequences that followed and that now prevail. Under the pretense of writing a peace treaty with Germany this peace conference establishe d Palestine as a home for the Jews and invested th e British Government with a mandate for the government of the country. The Jews have been at war with the Arabs since and the situation has become so intolerable that the British Gove rnment sought to divide the country be- tween the Jews and Ar abs and to surrender its responsibility, which pleased neither Jew nor Arab. The Arabs want all of Palestin e because it belongs to them and the Jews want it all, alt hough they have not settled it and do not expect to do so. Less than 500,000 Jews have moved there during the twenty-two years since the establishment of this al- leged Jewish home. Many of them, after locating there, have moved to America and other countr ies. More Jews have migrat- ed to America during that period th an have settled in Palestine. America is now the \"Palestine\" of the Jews. They don't want "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"70 to be farmers and craftsmen;—that is not their ticket. They prefer that the \"Goyim\" do the work, and themselves to live among them and trade with them and manipulate their currency systems. The establishment of this \"J ewish home\" was not involved as an issue in the world war or in the peace treaty with Ger- many. The Arabs were our allies and they fought side by side with the soldiers of the allies. It was cold blooded, indefensible robbery perpetrated at the instance of the \"Elders\" by Lloyd George and Woodrow Wilson and Georges Clemenceau. There would have been some just ification for it if the Brit- ish Government had acquired the lands of the Arabs with their consent, paying for them and buying land s sufficient for the whole Jewish race an d had thereafter forced all the Jews from all countries to migrate there; that would have done more to- ward preserving the peace of th e world than all of their man- dates, the Brussels Financial Conference, the International La- bor Board, and th e League of Nations combined. The worst of it is that the es tablishment of this \"Jewish home\" was cold blooded treachery to the Arab Government and people. The Arabs claim that they were induced to enter the war on the side of th e allies by the promis e that what is known as the Balfour Declaration woul d be rescinded and that the Arabians would not be molested in the peaceable ownership and possession of their country. This contention is not denied by the British Government, but the ex cuse is made that Woodrow Wilson insisted that the Jews be given this home and that Lloyd George consented as a matter of policy and in order to get some other things in the peace treaty that he desired. Palestine is now properly called th e \"twice promised land.\" It is likely that Germany also promised it in c onsideration of th e Russian deal. The defenseless Arabs were treacherously ravished by their comrades in arms. If the Jews want this or any other home, let them buy it. That is the honest way to get it, and they have plenty of money for that purpos e. Palestine doe s not belong to them because their ancestors lived there more than fifteen hun- dred years ago. The most of th em have no sentiment about it, for sentiment is not a Jewish ch aracteristic;—wi th them it is always strictly business. In any event, this home of the Jews was not involved in a peace settlement with Germany; nor was the establishment of "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"71 an International Labor Board to regulate the wages and condi- tions of labor; nor was the restoration of the gold standard; nor was the League of Nations. Th ese are not international sub- jects, but they are local to eac h country. It is the province of each and all of the countries of the world to define their own national policies regarding each and all of these important mat- ters. They were all projected into the peace treaty by the Jews.\" "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"XII. Gold \"With gold we can buy the most rebellious consciences, can fix the rate of all values, the current price of all products, can subsidize all State loans, and thereafter hold the states at our mercy.\"—From Funeral Oration of Rabbi Reichhorn. \"You are aware that the gold standard has been the ruin of the States which adopted it, for it has not been able to sat- isfy the demands for money, the more so that we have removed gold from circulation as far as possible.\"—From Protocol 20. The fixed policy of the management of the Rothschild for- tune is and has always been, mo nopoly. They brook no opposition and they fix the tolls of whatever business they engage in. In the beginning their operations we re confined to government loans, not only for the profit i nvolved but for the political power that it gave them. As the fortun e grew their fiel d of operations expanded until it embraced ever ything. Originally, the Roths- childs had competition for these government loans and conse- quently were not always able to fi x the rate of discount, but this opposition was soon crushed or absorbed. Among their early competitors was the Bank of England, which was chartered in 1694 for the purpose of financing the British Government. In consideration of a loan of 1,200,000 pounds the British government granted the Bank of England the exclusive privilege of issuing currency in the City of Lon- don and within a radius of 65 mi les thereof. Orig inally it was granted an annuity of 100,000 pounds a year for handling the government's business, and its property and operations were exempted from taxation. Adam Smith says of the Bank of England: \"She acts not only as an ordinary bank, but as a great engine of state. She receives and pays the greater part of the annuities which are due to the creditors of the public; she circulates Exchequer bills; and she advances to the Govern- ment the annual amount of the land and malt taxes which are frequently not paid till some years thereafter.\" These functions were in line with the operations of the Rothschilds and consequently they coveted the bank. There is no record of when they acquired it or how much they paid for it, for that is not the Rothschild way; it is one of their secrets. It was probably acquired by Nathan during the hey-day of his "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"73 activity, sometime around 1830 and as a result of an assault that he himself made on it. Pretending a grievance, Nathan Rothschild bought up its outstanding notes and personally presented them to the bank for payment day after day, and recei ved coin in payment therefor until he practically exhausted the bank's supply. The manage- ment of the bank capitulated. From that time until this day the Bank of England has been one of the most effective agencies of the Rothschilds in promoting their plans. The charter of the bank was amended eight times during the period from 1694 to 1844 when the Peel amendment was adopted; it has never been changed since. The original govern- ment loan of 1,200,000 pounds, instead of being paid, was in- creased from time to time until it had reached the sum of 11,- 015,000 pounds in 1844, when the Peel amendment was adopted. This amendment provided in substance that the Bank of England might issue its currency notes up to 15 million pounds upon its general assets, and that all currency i ssued in excess of this sum must be secured by an equal amount of gold coin or bullion; it also provided that other banks of issue should thereafter increase the amount of their currency notes, and then as their charters expired th e privilege of issuing curreny should be cancelled. The Peel amendment had far-reaching consequences apparent upon its face: (1) It demonetized silver, which theretofore circulated in England and throughout the world money; (2) it gave the Bank of England a monopoly of the rency of the British Empire; (3) it established the gold vertible note on the basis of a 100% gold coverage ; (4) it made the Bank of England the clear ing house of the British Empire and established the Br itish pound as world cu rrency; (5) it gave the management of the bank the po wer to fix and regulate prices and wages throughout the British Empire and to materially in- fluence them throughout the world. The Encyclopedia Britannica* states regarding the Peel amendment: \"It was indispensable, in attempting to obviate the defects inherent in our currency, to pr oceed cautiously, to respect, as far as possible, existing interests, and to avoid taking any step that might excite the fears or suspicions of the public; but the *Vol. III, p. 323."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"74 measures . . . were so skilfully contrived as to provoke little opposition, at the same time that they effected most important and highly beneficial changes\" Sir Robert Peel was then Prim e Minister of Great Britain and no doubt favored the amendment to the bank's charter which bears his name, but it was his bill only in the sense that the Fed- eral Reserve Act is President Wilson's bill. The apostate Jew Benjamin Disraeli was then at the head of the opposition party whihc overthrew the Peel ministry in 1848. Disraeli was sub- sequently Prime Minister of England. Disraeli was then the intimate friend of Lionel Rothschild whose family at that time ow ned and controll ed the Bank of England and the greater part of the gold of the world. It will be noted that the authority menti oned states that the act and its adoption \"were so skillfully contri ved as to provo ke little oppo- sition.\" Evidently it had the support of the leaders of both political parties, and evidentl y it was not understood by the members of parliament and by th e people genera lly, and evi- dently Disraeli had much to do w ith it, if he was not in fact its author. It is a singular fact that the bill was put over by the Roths- child agents in precisely the same manner that they put over the Federal Reserve Act. The setting for it was the same, viz: the catastrophe of 1840, which the Rothschilds precipitated;—the Federal Reserve Act grew out of the panic of 1907, which the Rothschilds also precipitated. It was similar in its obscure mean- ing to our Federal Re serve Act. It was put over as a result of a coalition of both political partie s,—as was our Federal Reserve Act. It gave the Rothschild management complete dominion over the welfare of the British Empi re and our Federal Reserve Act gave it to them over the people of America. It is worthy of note that the Peel amendment was adopted during the same year that Disraeli published his book \"Conings- by,\" which was intended to exalt the Rothschilds and the Jews. Disraeli then said of Lionel Rothschild: \"He was lord and mas- ter of the money mark ets of the world, and of course virtually the lord and master of everything else.\" The so-called Peel amendmen t enormously magnified the Rothschild power. If there was any question about the head of the Rothschild fortune being \"l ord and master of everything else\" prior to 1844, there can be none about his power since. This amendment made him the absolute \"lord and master of "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"75 everything\" since 1844,—and that was the secret purpose of its real authors. The gold standard was designed to limit the volume of cur- rency in order to enhance the power and value of gold and its owners. The currency cannot expand beyond the quantity of gold in circulation and it theref ore presents an absolute artifi- cial limit to the expansion of currency and credit and of busi- ness, which is based thereon. As a result the currency systems based on it always break down when there is an unusual demand for currency and credit created by war. All the nations of the world were compelled to aband on the gold standard during World War I, and consequently the Roth schild interest sought to re- store it immediately thereafter. The conferees at the peace conf erence, Lloyd George, Clem- enceau and President Wilson, crea ted two subordinate commit- tees to work out the details of their schemes:—one called the Economic Section and the other th e Financial Committee. Presi- dent Wilson appointed \"Elder\" Ba ruch as the American repre- sentative on the Economic Section and Thos. W. Lamont, a partner of J. P. Morg an & Co., as our representa tive on the Financial Committee; both of them Rothschild agents. The committee of the Economic Section held its session at or about the time of the Versaill es Conference but the Financial Conference was held later at Br ussels. The Economic Section's committee fixed the German repa rations at $12,000,000,000 in flagrant violation of the terms of surrender as proclaimed in President Wilson's fourteen points. The Brussels Financial Conferen ce in the face of the official advice of Professor Cassel decreed that the world should return to the gold standard. This necess arily meant that all monies, in- cluding the dollar, would be greatly enhanced in value, and prices and wages would be reduced accordingly. The dollar has in fact been enhanced from two- to three-fold, and prices and wages and values have been reduced to the same extent. It also neces- sarily meant that it would be impossible for Germany to pay the reparations fixed by the Economic S ection, and for the Allies to pay the monies borrowed from America. Following the decision of the Financial Conference, the \"Elders\" sent Professor Kemmerer and their other lackeys to the principal countries of the world to reorganize their financial "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"76 systems upon a gold basis. They even established the gold stand- ard in poor old defenseless China that had always been on a silver basis and with a limited currency volume of only about $2.50 per capita of silver and a negligible quantity of gold, with the result that millions of Chin ese perished from starvation. The victorious Allies turned Germany over to the tender mercies of the Jews. After having fixed the German reparations at an impossible figure under the gold standard, they drove an- other nail in the coffin of prostr ate Germany in order to make assurance doubly sure. They not only re-established the currency of Germany upon a gold basis but they imposed upon the Ger- man people our infamous Federal Reserve System, calling it the \"Dawes Plan,\" by which they gave the Elders the power to con- trol the volume of currency and credit and the level of prices and wages. They likewise made it impo ssible for our Al lies, Britain, France and other countries, to repay the loans we made them. It was probably never intended that they should be repaid. Elder Baruch is primarily responsible for them for at the time they were made he was President Wilson's right hand man and was directing his foreign policy. There is no authority in our con- stitution for loans or gifts to the Allies. They were made in utter and flagrant violation of law. They were made for the purpose of enabling foreign countries to remain on the gold standard and pay their debts to the Rothschilds. Thus, for the pretended purpose s of writing a peace treaty that would establish permanent peace among the nations of the world and of collecting German reparations, the \"Elders\" par- tially established their League of Nations and their International Labor Bureau, and re-establishe d the gold standard,—but for only a brief period. All countries have since been compelled to abandon the gold standard, but this was not done until after it ha d impoverished the people of the world and impair ed their morale. The people in their despair have overthrown their governments and created dictatorships and semi-distators hips; nations are at war with each other; and a general war is on. This is all precisely ac- cording to the program of the Elders as set out in their pro- tocols. Thos. W. Lamont knew that th e return to the gold stand- ard would be the ruin of all of the States that attempted it, for "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"77 that result was clea rly pointed out to him by the report to the Brussels Financial Co nference of his specia list, Professor Gus- tav Cassel of Sweden. He no doubt knew it apart from this re- port, but this report made it clear and certain. Professor Cassel was appointed to advise the committee and he did advise them that the restoration of the gold stand- ard would make it impossible for all of the nation s of the world to pay their respective debts; th at it meant bankr uptcy and ruin for all of them. He made an unanswerable argument in sup- port of his thesis a nd yet Mr. Lamont and his fellow conspira- tors decreed that the world should pay its debts and base its values upon Rothschild ow ned and manipulated gold. There could be but one purpose in view and that was to de- stroy all of the States of the world, for th at was the necessary effect and it was the known e ffect. Their purposes were poverty and suffering and unrest and communism and war, for these were the necessary and known results. It was for the purpose of destroying all govern ments and establishing their Jewish world empire with their \"King-Despot of the Blood of Zion\" as emper- or, for that is the plan of their protocols. The present war has now develo ped into a struggle for the preservation of the gold stan dard. In the beginning Hitler sought only the rest oration of pre-war Ge rmany, but it has now passed that stage. It appears to be his present purpose to de- stroy the Jewish Empire which is so interwoven with the British Empire that the two apparently must go down together. The hybrid Churchill is ready to sacrif ice the last Englishman to pre- serve the Jewish Empire;—the British empire is only an inciden- tal consideration. With victory within his grasp Hitler proposed to negotiate a peace on the ba sis of preservi ng the British Em- pire, which Churchill rejected. It is the Jewish Empire that is of such deep concern to our hybrid President. He appears to be willing to sacr ifice the youth and wealth of this nation to pres edve it. It was for that purpose that he caused to be acquired and stored more than 20 billion dollars of gold; that he sent Sumner Welles on his scouting ex- pedition ; that Secretary Hull called the Havana conference; and that he is organizing a huge army and navy. "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"78 XIII. World War II \"We must be in a position to respond to every act of op- position by war with the neighbor s of that country which dares to oppose us; but if these neighbors should also venture to stand collectively together agains t us, then we must offer re- sistance by a universal war.\"—From Protocol 7. The first world war deposed the Kaiser and Bethmann Hol- weg, but did not depose Rathnau and the other Jews; it trans- formed the German government from a Jew-controlled monarchy to a Jew-controlled democracy. It is true there was a different set of Jews in control of the democracy; different men, but the same old Rothschild influence, Ro thschild ideals, and Rothschild program. Their first act was to debase the German currency, the reichsmark. They issu ed many billions of it and continued to issue it until it had no value. Th ey sold vast quantities of this money at heavy discou nts in America and other countries, and then made it utterly worthless, thereby fleecing real money from the people of the world. They bought German properties, fac- tories, lands, etc., on time at high prices and paid their obliga- tions in worthless money. After a ll of this wild inflation and after having acquired and paid for their properties with nothing, this same malign Jewish infl uence through the Dawes Commis- sion brought about a reorganiza tion of the German Reichbank, a restoration of the gold standard, and deflation. Thus the Jews have oppressed and impoverished the people of Germany. They have had a great picnic and very rich pick- ing, and they are now paying fo r their fun. It was estimated by Adolf Hitler that the Jews owned four-fifths of the wealth of Germany. Think of it. This alien race comprising less than 1% of the population owned 80% of the wealth of the country. The worst of it is that they st ole it by the manipulation of the German currency system—in the same way that they have stolen the wealth of our country . The wonder is that Hitler has been so patient and forbearing. President Wilson proclaimed his famous fourteen points to Germany and the world as a basis fo r a truce and peace. In substance they assured Germany that if she would cease hos- tilities that the German peopl e and government would not be "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"79 penalized. The terms of the peace were formally accepted by the Kaiser, and accordingly an armistice was declared which was later followed by the Versailles treaty. When Germany had laid down her arms and was prostrate and defenseless she was turned over to the Jews to be dissected and sterilized. In a radio spee ch made by Adolf Hitler a few months before World War II, he recited the promises that were made to induce the surrender of the German army by President Wilson in his famous fourteen points, the flagrant breach of those promises although impliedly guaranteed by the American Government, the dismemberment of the German Empire and the imposition of impossible penalties, and the great depth to which the Jewish Administration of the German government fol- lowing the, war had reduced th e people. Of this he said: \"Jewish parasites, on one hand, plundered the nation ruth- lessly, and, on the other hand, incited the people when it had been reduced to misery. As the misfortune of our nation be- came the only aim and object of this race it was possible to breed among the growing army of unemployed suitable ele- ments for Bolshevik revolution. \"Decay of political order and confusion of public opinion by the irresponsible Jewish press led to ever stronger shocks to the economic life and, conse quently, to increasing misery and to greater readiness to absorb subversive Bolshevik ideas. The army of Jewish World Revolution, as the army of unem- ployed was called, finally rose to almost seven million.\" That is precisely what they are now doing in America, and for precisely the same purpose. That is the manner by which they gained temporary control of th e Austrian government. It is their method of operation. Our pe ople have not ye t sunk to the depth of poverty and misery and despair suffered by the German people, following World War I, but they are rapidly approaching that condition, and even now they provide fertile soil for the seeds of communism and revolution. Hitler's speech was not one of an ambitious, sabre-rattling braggart, but it was that of a s ober, deliberate, determined man, with a mission to perform, who abhors war. He said of the war-mongers: \"If the cry of 'Never another Munich!' is raised in the world today this simply confirms the fact that a peaceful solution of the problem appeared to be the most fatal thing that ever happened in the eyes of those war-mongers. They are sorry no blood was shed—not their blood of course-—for"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"80 these agitators are, of course, never to be found where shots are being fired, but only where money is being made! No, it is the blood of the nameless soldiers.\" In his speech Adolf Hitler pl ainly and unequivocally said to Poland that Germany must have Danzig and the Polish Corri- dor, both formerly German, but he did not demand Silesia, also formerly German. He said that in the interest of World Peace he had made a treaty with France regarding Alsace, also formerly German, and he proposed to abide by it. Hitler undertook to negotiate a treaty with Poland by which these fractions of Germa ny would be restored, by agree- ment. Pending these negotiations there was a pogrom against the resident Germans of Poland. Despite that fact Hitler made an appointment with the Jewish Polish foreign minister Beck to conclude the treaty, which Beck failed to keep. Instead of do- ing so he went to Do wning Street in London for advice. Hitler then sent an army to suppress the Polish uprising and thereupon England and France declared war on Germany;—thus World War II began. When war was declared the Alli es sought to encircle Ger- many; to that end they sought to make an al liance with Soviet Russia and the Balkan states. Pending these nego tiations Ger- many effected an alliance with Russia, the terms of which are not clear, but it app ears to be an economic alliance and not a military one. Both the Russian and German governments have been crit- icized for this alliance, which appears to be a misfit. The Ger- mans claim that it was a matter of self-preservation on the part of Germany and that if she had no t entered into an alliance with Russia the Allies would have done so,—which is probably true. The communists claim that it is entirely consistent with their principles, that it is to the a dvantage of communism to engulf the entire world in war and then administer on the wreckage,— which is also true, and which is in keeping with their principles and program. That no doubt account s for the fact that com- munists of all countries approve this misalliance. After conquering Poland Hitler again proposed to the Allies and to the world to make peace on the basis of restoring to Ger- many only that which was taken fr om her by the treaty of Ver- sailles, with the exception of Als ace. The only difference in this and his original proposal was that it involved the return of the"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"81 colonies which the treaty of Ve rsailles awarded to Great Brit- ain. The answer to th is overture was that they would not treat with the Hitler gove rnment; that Hitler and Hitlerism (meaning anti-Semitism) must be destroyed. True to her ancient strategy it was the policy of Eng- land to starve the enemy by bloc kade with her sea power. In violation of international law, which has been made largely by the British Empire, she imposed a blockade upon both German exports and imports. This Germany met with her submarines and air force, with the result that the starving has been \"the other way round.\" Britain is now getting a dose of her own medicine and it Is evidently very distasteful to her. Up to this time Germany ha s fought the war according to the rules of civilized warfare; she has not abused her superior power in the air by attacking wi th poison gas, as the British evidently expected; she has not attempted to assassinate any British leader; she has given sh elter and transportation to the soldiers and seamen of Britain when her ships were destroyed. There were a number of these prisoners of war on the \"Alt- mark\" which was anchored in a Norwegian port. By order of Churchill a British cruiser, in viol ation of the neutrality of Nor- way, attacked the Altmark, anchored in a Norwegian port, shot several of the crew who were unarmed and did not offer re- sistance, and released the prisoner s. It is obvious that Germany could have left all of these pris oners to their fate when their ships were sunk. The dastardly, cowardly, murder ous attack of the British upon the defenseless Altmark was applauded by the Jewish British and American pr ess as a great British victory. According to the Associated Press the distinguished Nor- wegian novelist, Knut Hamsun, addressing his countrymen, said of this banditry: \"When the Britishers in their prodigious savagery forced a passage into Jossing Fjord and infringed our neutrality, you did nothing about it. But when the Germans occupied Nor- way to prevent war in our country you did something: You conspired with our runaway King and his private government and mobilized. Norwegians! Throw away your rifles and return home. The Germans are fighting for us and now are crushing England's tyranny over us and all neutrals.\" Winston Churchill also violated the neutrality of Norway by mining her territorial waters."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"It has been conclusively shown by official papers which fell into the hands of the Germans when they captured Oslo, as well as by other facts, that the Bri tish through the Jew Hambro, head of the Norwegian government, had previously arranged to send troops to Norway and to take charge of all of her strategic ports. They appear to have been actually en route when Germany, hav- ing a shorter distance to travel, and superior generalship, landed her troops in Norway first. Sh e \"beat them to the draw.\" Nor- way capitulated and is now un der the control of Germany. The Allies were very much disturbed by this victory. The Jewish press demanded a more vigorous prosecution of the war. Despite the fact that Lord Admiral Churchill, then head of the War Board, had been primarily responsible for the Norwegian defeat, the British government re tired Chamberlain, and Church- ill was made Prime Minister. Chur chill re-organized the cabinet, bringing into it two other pro- Jews and Hitler-haters,—Anthony Eden and Duff-Cooper. They boldly announced that the Allies would take the offensive and would attack Germany; about the same time they transferred the Br itish fleet from Scapa Flow to the Mediterranean. This meant one of two things: either that th e Allies meant to attack Germany through the Ba lkans or that they had moved the fleet for the purpose of deceiving Hitle r into the belief that they would do so, while their r eal purpose was to attack through Holland and Belgium. If the fleet was moved for the purpose of deception the ruse was an ineffe ctive one and probably an un- fortunate one for the Allies . Hitler was not deceived. The Germans claim that the Allies had made arrangements with the governments of Holland and Belgiu m to make the at- tack through those countries, an d Germany again \"beat them to the draw.\" We don't know the truth. It will likely be revealed later. The Allies have not won a single battle or diplomatic vic- tory, with the possible excepti on that they bought the support of Turkey with a loan of $140 ,000,000 which has proven to be a barren victory.

Why did Czechoslovakia lose her independence? What made Poland pass out? What caused Denmark, Norway, Holland and Bel- gium to cease operations as free countries? Why are England and France likely to meet the same fate? German aggression, you say. Not at all. Organized Jewry is the answer. \"Organized Jewry made Schushnigg and others in Austria pursue a mad policy of national suicide and Germany rescued that nation from the unholy alliance. Organized Jewry made Benes, young Massaryk and ot hers in Czechoslovakia pursue a policy of sheer madness. They lost their country. Organized Jewry drove Negrin, Del Vayo and other leaders in Spain along their mad course until the peopl e under Franco rescued that nation. Organized Jewry drove Beck, Smigly Ridz and other leaders in Poland along the same mad course toward destruc- tion. In Norway organized Jewry, working through the part Jewish Hambro, drove that nation along a path of pro-British sympathy and it ceased to exist as an independent nation. The King of Belgium and the Queen of Holland played the game of organized Jewry and now foreign troops are in command of their towns and cities. \"England and France for decades have become the nesting grounds of organized Jewry. The Churchills, Edens, Duff Coopers, Hore Belishas and many others in England, and the Reynauds, the Daladiers and others in France have been the pawns of the Rothschilds, the Sassoons and others. Many of the political leaders themselves have a mixture of base blood coursing through their veins in all of these countries.* These two great empires under the lash and whip of organized Jewry are tramping straight and inevitably to their doom. \"The American foreign policy of the Hoovers and the Roosevelts, the Hulls and the Tafts, the Landons and the Frank Knoxes and Key Pitmans are h eading us straight down the same path of despair. The Baruchs, the Kuhn Loebs, the Mor- genthaus and others in our land are lashing our weak political leaders to unwittingly destroy our nation in the same way that European nations have been destroyed.

America will remain the same glorious re- public she has always been.\" The Germans have experienced defeat once.

The Germans are moving with irresistible powe r toward London and they will likely reach their destination befo re Roosevelt will be able to inveigle America into the war. The Jews, as stated in their protocols, have met Germany's \"act of opposition by war\" but they have not been able to \"offer resistance by a universal war,\" In the same protocol they say th at they \"shall respond with the guns of America or China or Japan,\" but China and Japan are now otherwise engaged, and \"Uncle Shylock\" wants to stay out of it.

The people of America do not want a super-govern- ment or to be rule d by the pope of Rome or a \"despot of the blood of Zion.\" We barely es caped it when the republicans, with the aid of \"twelve willful\" democrats defeated the League of Nations project by a very small margin; for the League of Nations meant that very thing. The Jewish press informs us that one of the original objec- tives of the present war, calle d World War II, was the creation of the United States of Europe,— in fact Prime Minister Cham- berlain stated the same purpose in on e of his spee ches,—but it has gotten beyond that stage. It is now a struggle to preserve the British Empire and the gold standard. The Jews have bled the Britis h Empire white. They have exploited all of the colonies, particularly India and South Africa, but Australia, New Zealand and Canada have not escaped them. They impoverished Ireland to the extent that that country re- volted. It is signific ant that India and Ireland have not come to the rescue of the \"mother coun try, England,\" in this her hour of peril, and that she has had no support from Arabia, her form- er ally. The Arabians have been fooled once with the promise of Palestine, and while th is has been renewed in a modified form they did not fall for the bait. Nor has England had any suppor t from the Jews of Pales- tine so far as we have been informed by the Jewish press. It is certain that if they had raised a corps of thirty men the press would have heralded it all over the world. The Jews prefer that the Gentiles do all of the meni al work and all of the fighting. When one of them is drafted he is usually a \"conscientious ob- jector\" or he finds his way to the commissary department. One of the troubles with the Allies is the graft of the Jews in their Ordnance and Commissa ry Departments whic h are in Jewish hands. If we must choose between be ing ruled by the Pope of Rome"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"86 and a \"despot of the bl ood of Zion,\" the Pope is preferable. He at least will let us live and will not enslave us. But there does not appear to be any ground for the implied charge in the protocols that the Catholic hierarc hy is actively seeking to recover its lost political power and to reestablish its temporal dominion. Undoubtedly the Pope would be delighted to see a Catholic government in America and in every other country of the world. But there is no evidence known to me that the Pope is seeking to gain these ends in the clandestine, subter- ranean manner as set out in the protocols or that he is cooperat- ing with the Elders for such ends. The Pope is now having great difficulty in maintaining the status of the church in its ancient strongholds , viz., Mexico and Czecho Slovakia. It is hardly conceivable that under these circumstances he or the Catholic hierarchy would be actively at work undermining the governments of other countries through the impoverishment of the people and the destruction of their governments. On the contrary there is evid ence that the Pope does not approve the present Jewishized administration. The most ef- fective and boldest critic of it has been Father Coughlin of De- troit. If the press is to be believed, (and I do not swear by it), the Pope actually approved Fath er Coughlin's campaign against the Roosevelt-Jewish-deflation administration. The Catholic church ruled practically all the countries of Europe for a period of more than a thousand years following the fall of the Roman Empire. It is the period know n as the \"dark ages.\" The people were ignorant, superstitious, and desperately poor, and the church was at no pains to enlighten them and to help them. The church has surr endered its temporal authority grudgingly and after much bloody st rife. Even now it maintains the semblance of a political government at the Vatican, to which some nations send their ambassadors. Contrary to the policy and tradition of our government the President appointed Myron C. Taylor, Chairman of the Board of the United States Steel Cor- poration, as our ambassador to the Vatican. There was a political party in most countries of Europe known as the \"Catholic Party,\" wh ich was devoted primarily to the interests of the church. The Order of the Jesuits was form- erly the political or ganization of the chur ch, which appears to have had a code of political mora lity as cynical as that of the "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"87 Jewish \"Learned Elders of Zion.\" The Jesuit organization does not appear to be active in America. The present war is a death struggle between Hitlerism (anti-Semitism) and Jewish imperialism. It is not primarily for the restoration of Poland or Czecho Slovakia or any other country except insofar as such re storation contributes to Jewish imperialism. It is primarily to destroy Hitler and Germany be- cause they are both anti-Semitic, and to preserve the gold stand- ard because through it the Jews control the economic destiny of all countries. Hitler abandoned the gold standa rd, since which date Ger- many has been prosperous and with no unemployment. Germany is fighting this war without gold and is thereby demonstrating to the world that it is not necessary to borrow gold from the Jews in order to wage war. Hitler threatens the very f oundations of the Jewish em- pire throughout the world and he now appears to seriously threaten the British na vy which the Jews have used to preserve their empire. Our beloved ( ? ) President Roosevelt is itching to get into this war to save world Jewry and to promote himself and not to save America. All of this war hysteria in the United States has been created by the Je wish press and F. D. Roosevelt to serve their fellow tribesmen and not to serv e their fellow Americans. In a speech delivered before the National Social Congress at Nurnberg, Germany, on Sept. 13, 1935, Dr. Joseph Goebbels, Mr. Hitler's assistant, said: \"Where are the men behind the scenes of this virulent world movement? Who are the inventors of all this madness? Who transplanted this ensemble into Russia and is today mak- ing the attempt to have it prevail in other countries? The answer to these questions disclose s the actual secret of our anti- Jewish policy and our uncompromising fight against Jewry; for the Bolshevik International is in reality nothing less than a Jewish Internationale. \"It was the Jew who discovered Marxism. It is the Jew who for decades past has endeavored to stir up world revolu- tion through the medium of Marxism.. It is the Jew who is today at the head of Marxism in all the countries of the world. Only in the brain of a nomad who is without nation, race and country could this satanism ha ve been hatched. And only one possessed of a satanic malevolence could launch this revolu- tionary attack.\""},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Every word and every sentence of the above statement is true. It will bear reading a second time. It not only explains the \"actual secret\" of the anti-Jewis h policy of Germany but it ex- plains the \"actual secret\" of anti-Semitism in America and throughout the world. The Jews have in times past been expelled from every coun- try in Europe and some of thos e of Asia. They were expelled long before their scheme was brought to light by the publication of the protocols and perhaps before any protocols were written, but not before the Talmud. They were expelled twice from France and were expelled and kept out of England for 400 years after their expulsion. Why? It was not because of the ignorance and brutality of all peoples in all ages but because the Jews have been what they are, with the same ch aracteristics and the same ideals and purposes throughout the ages . These characteristics and ideals are reflected in their Talmud and protocols and communist code. Before any World Empire can be established it is necessary first to destroy the American form of government. The plan of the protocols for that purpose is to impoverish the people, impair their morals and nullify their constitution. There can be no dic- tator or king or emperor so long as the pe ople are happy and prosperous and patriotic and adhere to their established form of government. The method set out in detail in the protocols is the only possible way to subjugate the American people to the \"Des- pot of the blood of Zion\" or any other despot. The destruction of our government has been the principal objective of the \"Jew Deal\" and the present Je wish administration. "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"89 XV. Our Undeclared War Against Germany \"We have harnessed them all to the task; each one of them on his own account is boring away at the last remnants of authority, is striving to overthrow all established form of order.

And the weapons in our hands are limitless ambitions, burning greediness, merciless vengeance, hatreds and malice.\"—From Protocol 9. Soon after the German order of fine and expu lsion of the Jews, President Roosevelt with drew our Ambassador to Ger- many for consultation, (as announced in the press), but he is still at home. Quite a lengthy consultation. This is an act of war; it is usually the first step precedi ng a declaration of war, but Hit- ler refused to accept the challenge for the obvious reason that he does not want war with us, despite the fact that we are wholly unprepared. The treaty of Munich was a sa d disappointment to Interna- tional Jewry and to Fra nklin D. Roosevelt. Mr. Roosevelt showed his resentment by imposing a 25% tariff on German importa- tions and attaching th e monies of the Reic hbank on deposit in New York banks. These were over t acts of war which Hitler has met with firmness and digni ty. He could do no less than withdraw his own Ambassador and impose a like tariff upon our exports to Germany. If he desired war with our country he has ample grounds for it. It is probably a disappointment to the President that he did not accept the challenge and declare war. In his first message to the 76th Congress, the President said: \"Words may be futile, but war is not the only means of commanding a decent respect for the opinions of mankind. There are many methods short of war, but stronger and more effective than mere words, of bringing home to aggressor gov- ernments the aggregate sentiments of our own people.\" It is significant that no othe r country of the world has im- posed such a tariff upon German imports. Germany can get along without our wheat and corn and cotton and meat and dairy exports as well as we can get al ong without her market for them, "},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"90 but both countries are being injured. This argument, however, has no force with men who are seeking to impoverish our people and to destroy our government. Apparently the President made some sort of a secret mili- tary alliance with the govern ments of Engla nd and France. At a secret meeting with the Senate Military Affairs Committee he is reported to ha ve said that the \"frontiers of France are our frontiers.\" That is the traditional positi on of Great Britain. He denounced this report as a \"deliberate lie\" but he would not release the members of the Military Affairs Committee from their pledge of secrecy, and he suppressed an investigation. Sen- ator Lundeen of Minnesota, who is a member of this committee and attended this conference with the President, said in a speech in the Senate that the President's statement to this committee, if revealed, would \"shock and stun\" the American people. The President pretends that he does not want war and that he is trying to avoid it. He made two dramatic appeals to Hitler to halt,—the first by radio, the second by message. In the second he proposed to act as me diator and to call a confer- ence of the nations of the earth to enter into a ten-year truce. On the day preceding this messa ge he denounced Hitler in a much publicized speech, as an aggressor and a disturber of world peace. This was not the way to bring about a conference and a ten- year truce. If Mr. Roosevelt real ly desired such conference and truce he would have submitted his offer in the usual way through diplomatic channels, and not by proclaiming it from the house- tops. He desired that the offer should be rejected, and made it as offensively as he could. It was made for \"home consump- tion\" and to rally the people of America behind him. He does not appear to have fooled many people. Dorothy Thompson (Levy) and the other war mongers, all with one ac- cord clapped their hands and applauded—not because they thought his offer was a step in the direction of peace, but be- cause they believed it to be a st ep in the direction of war. Nor did it fool Hitler and Mussolini. Mussolin i's paper said of it: \"We deny the President any right to intervene in European questions because his country is not directly interested as well as because he personally has not the slightest claim to assum- ing the role of friendly and impartial mediator.\" The article said President Roosevelt's appeal evidently was"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"91 for internal use. It charged him with wanting to divert Amer- ican opinion from \"the unemploy ment which grows day by day.\" When the Allies declared war on Germany President Roose- velt immediately got busy. His first act was to create an interna- tional commission headed by Myro n Taylor, Chairman of the Board of the United States Steel Corporation, to assist in the migration of the Jews. We do no t know what this commission has done or is doing, but it is still at work and we are putting up the money, and the Jews are landing here by the ship-load. No country except the Unite d States,—not even Russia— has volunteered a home for the Je ws. They have been sent to various South American countries and have been turned back. But we are sending our ships for them and their gold, and con- gress has recently appropriate d $50,000,000 for their mainten- ance. In defiance of our immigrati on laws, which are entirely too lax, the President and Madam Secretary Perkins are admitting Jews, without limit, to America. It was reported that 3,000 per day are now being received with out restriction, and the balance of them on a six months visit, which means permanency—at least so far as this Administration is concerned. They are evi- dently coming now at an even faster rate. The immigration law provides for quotas for all races and nationalities except the Jew; there is no limit as to Jews. The immigration authorities class the Jew as a religion and not a race, with the result that the gr eat majority of the immigrants we are now receiving from all countries are Jews. They are in fact an alien peopl e with alien characteristics— mental, moral, and physical—whi ch are always the same and remain the same whether they are German, Russian, Spanish, American, or what not. They don't merge in the melting pot or by intermarriage except to bequeath their Jewish charac- teristics to the offspr ing. They are as distinct in their char- acteristics and as undesirable as are the Japanese and Chinese, which we exclude. The Jews shoul d be excluded for we already have too many of them. America is now the haven and refuge for the Jews of the world. We have more Jews in the United States than there are in England, France, and Palestin e combined.

It is said that in the Constitutional Convention both General Washington and Benjamin Frankl in opposed the admission of Jews into America. Robt. E. Edmondson is authority for the fol- lowing quotation from the diary of Charles Pinckney of South Carolina, a member of that convention. The Jews deny the au- thenticity of this historical memo but that is characteristic of the Jews. It is their custom to dest roy documents of this type and then deny their authenticity. The statement is evidence of the vision and wisdom of Wash ington and Franklin : \" 'I agree fully with General Washington—that we must protect this young nation from an insidious influence and impenetration. That menace, gentlemen, is the Jew. \" 'In whatever country Jews have settled in any great numbers, they have lowered its moral tone; depreciated its commercial integrity; have segregated themselves and have not been assimilated; have sn eered at and tried to undermine the Christian religion upon which that nation is founded by objecting to its restrictions; have built up a state within a state; and when opposed have tried to strangle that country to death financially, as in the case of Spain and Portugal. \" 'For over 1700 years the Jews have been bewailing their sad fate in that they have been exiled from their homeland, as they call Palestine. But, gentlemen, did the world today give it to them in fee simple they would at once find some cogent reason for not return ing. Why? Because they are vampires, and vampires do not live on vampires. They cannot live only among themselves. They must subsist on Christians and other peoples not of their race. \" 'If you do not exclude them from these United States, in this Constitution, in less than 200 years they will have swarmed in such great numbers that they will dominate and devour the land, and change our form of government, for which we Americans have shed our blood, given our lives, our substance, and jeopardized our liberty. \" 'If you do not exclude them, in less than 200 years our descendants will be working in the fields to furnish them substance while they will be in the counting houses rubbing their hands. I warn you, gentlemen, if you do not exclude the Jews for all time, your children will curse you in your graves. \" 'Jews, gentlemen, are Asiatics, let them be born where they will, or how many generations they are away from Asia they never will be otherwise. Their ideas do not conform to an American's, and will not even though they live among us ten generations. A leopard cannot change its spots. Jews are Asiatics, are a menace to this country if permitted entrance, and should be excluded by this Constitution.'"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"93 \"Pinckney is further quoted as saying: 'We were amazed at the words of Mr. Franklin, especially as there are only about 500 Jews in the country. I trow Mr. Franklin may be right. In less than 200 years, if we admit them the scoundrels will be calling US their ANCESTORS'.\" Every word of the above statement is true. It is a pity they were not heeded. It is not for us to get excited about Germany's treatment of the Jews. If the German govern ment thinks that they brought about World War I with its frightful consequences to the Ger- man people; if they believe that they are responsible for the pres- ent war; if they believe the mu rder of Ernst von Rath was the act of International Jewry; if for these or other reasons they con- sider the Jews undesirable and wish to fine and expel them,—that is their affair and not ours. When World War II was declared the Americans in Europe hurried home. About 1500 of them were on the Athenia which was torpedoed and su nk in British waters . The Germans claim that they had no U-boa ts in that vicinity and that the ship was sunk by the British themselves fo r the purpose of influencing our government to declare wa r on Germany,—which Churchill denies. There was no reason for Germany to sink the ship for it was en route to America, and it had no provisions or war sup- plies or soldiers on it. There was good reason, however, for the British to sink it because of the American passengers on it— which was the casus helium of our entry into World War I. We cannot accept Mr. Churchill's statements at par. He is the Jewish-type of politician that only says and does those things that will promote his own purposes. In fact he has publicly stated, boastfully, that he only gi ves out such information as he thinks it is good for the public to know,—of which he is the ex- clusive judge. President Roosevelt sent his envoy, Sumner Welles, abroad for the pretended purpose of s ounding out the wa rring countries and the Pope of Rome on the subj ect of peace. There was much secrecy attending this mission. It was stated in the press that the President wanted to get first hand information about the situation and about the terms of peace. The real purpose was to effect a truce until we were better prepared for war."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"94 More recently still the President, according to press reports, appealed to Mussolini not to enter the war.

We do not know the truth. We do know, however, that Mr. Roosevelt is meddling in European affairs to the full extent of his ability, and that he is rendering every possible aid to Britain and is feverishly preparing to join her in the present war. We know furthermore that Germany is not now threaten- ing us with war and has never done so. Germany has not search- ed our mails or impounded our ships as have the British.

Plan of Mobilization \"It is only with a despotic ruler that plans can be elab- orated extensively and clearly in such a way as to distribute the whole properly among the several parts of the machinery of the State; from this the conclusion is inevitable that a satis- factory form of government for any country is one that con- centrates in the hands of one responsible person. Without an absolute despotism there can be no existence for civilization which is carried on not by the masses but by their guide, who- soever that person may be.\"—From Protocol 2. We are now preparing for war on a gigantic scale. With an admitted national debt of $45,000,000,000, with the taxpayers taxed to the point that industry is no longer attractive, and with poverty and distress stalking th roughout the land , Congress has authorized about 17 billions of dollars for war purposes. In a speech in the United Stat es Senate on March 6, 1939 (see Congressional Record of th at date, page 3224), Senator Lynn Frazier of North Dakota said: \"No one can make me believe that all these war prepara- tions are for defense. In my opinion they are preparations for war, and a foreign war at that. Does anyone know what nations are expected to attack us? Does anyone know who is going to invade our shores? Surely all the great nations of the world have their hands full at home at the present time, and there is no imminent danger of any attacks upon the United States . . . \"We have recently heard about secret conferences and secret sessions here at home. The question naturally arises, Are we ourselves already involved in foreign entanglements and secret treaties? Who knows? If there is anyone who knows, he will not tell, because we have been unable to find out what these secret agreemen ts are, if any, and whether or not we have any.\" Surely the members of the United States Senate should be advised of \"foreign entanglemen ts\" and \"secret treaties.\" The Constitution provides that they mu st be ratified by the senate. If the President made such commitments he has already as- sumed the powers of a dictator. Upon conclusion of the military compact between England and France, England's King and Queen visited the President of France, which visit he later returned. Magnificent receptions of mediaeval splendor were held in both England and France. The "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"96 King and Queen then came to Amer ica, visited President Roose- velt at the White House and also at his Hyde Park residence. These visits, both to Paris and Washington, were evidently ar- ranged by the Jewish administrati ons of the thre e countries to effect the triple alliance they were attempting to make in prep- aration for the war. It is likely that President Roosevelt is responsible for the Russian invasion of Finland. So viet Russia sought in advance to obtain from Finland by nego tiation, the territory that was taken from Russia by the Treaty of Versailles. This failed upon the advice of the Allies an d upon their promises to help Finland in case of war. They no doubt made these promises be- lieving that if Finland was attacked that the United States would come to her aid because Finlan d alone of all European coun- tries had recognized her obligation to the United States to repay the moneys loaned her. They no doubt made them on assurances that had previously been given by the President. Although deeply sympathizing with Finland, the people of America were not willing to go to war in her behalf. \"Uncle Shylock\" has become \"gun shy;\" he has been worked once too often. If it is true that Finland was made a sacrifice to get us into the war, as appears to be the case, then she is another \"Athenia\" and another victim of British diplomacy and duplicity. Senator Frazier said further, in the speech mentioned: \"There is agitation for the passage of the so-called indus- trial mobilization bill. According to my information, the bill has not been introduced at this session of the Congress, but it was introduced at the last session, and a great deal was said about it. It was modified somewhat at the last session, and still there is much agitation about it ... \"This industrial mobilization bill was introduced in the last Congress—it was an admini stration measure—so that in the event of war the President of the United States would be given the power to draft about 4,000,000 young men for war purposes.\" This mobilization plan was gotten up about five years ago by the Secretary of War an d the Secretary of the Navy, which indicates that they have been contemplating war for at least that length of time. Indee d, all of this regimentation of the laborer and the farmer and th e industrialist has been prim- ing us for war, and with war as the objective.

The following are some of its salient provisions: \"With respect to any product, foodstuff, material, real property, or right declared by him essentially for the national security and defense in the prosecution of war, to fix and establish just and reasonable maximum, minimum, or absolute prices or rates or rentals at which such product, foodstuff, material, commodity, real property, or right may be bought, sold, rented, or otherwise contracted for, whether such transaction be with the Government or between persons of the civilian population or between any other parties what- soever . . . \"(i) To regulate, limit, or prohibit the purchase, sale, use, IMPORT, EXPORT, * * * transportation, manufacture, or distribution of any product, foodstuff, material, commodity, real estate, or right; \" ( j ) From time to time, whenever he shall find it essen- tial to license the 'production, manufacture, sale, USE, IM- PORT, EXPORT, storage, distri bution, or transportation of any product, foodstuff, material, commodity, real property, or right . . . \"(1) To requisition and take possession of any product, foodstuff, materials, commodity, real property, or right, and on such terms as he may deem advisable to sell or otherwise dispose of such product, foodstuff, material, commodity, real property, or right . . . \"The power and authority conf erred by this title upon the President may be exercised in whole or in part under his direc- tion and during his pleasures by such agencies or offices of the United States as he may designa te, and he shall have power to appoint an administrator or administrators to exercise such designated powers. Such administ rator or administrators shall receive salary or saralies of $10,000 per annum. The President is authorized to create or provide for such additional agencies of the Government as he may deem necessary to execute the functions authorized under this title, and to appoint and dis- miss at pleasure such officers and employees and to fix their salaries and compensation.\" \"It is,\" said Congressman Shaf er of Michigan, \"the most astounding document ever published in a democracy.\" If it does not mean a dictat orship, what does it mean? The President is given ab solute dictatorial power to conscript the people of America and all of th eir possessions, which means that "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"98 this power will be ex ercised by the bunch of Jews that are now in control of the executive depa rtment of our government. It means that our cons titutional form of government has been discarded,—not temporar ily but permanently. Barney Baruch or some other Jew will be Chairman of the War Industries Board, and he will not relinquish this post when the war terminates; nor will our President relinqui sh any of his war powers. There will be no mo re elections. It will be goodbye to our constitutional form of government, to our state govern- ments, and to our freedom. It was stated in the press th at Bernard Baruch had lunch with the President and had a conference with him regarding the war situation. Baruch was non-co mmittal after th is conference as to whether or not they had discussed the subject of his being appointed chairman of a War Indu stries Board soon to be cre- ated. It is likely that he wants the job and that he will get it in due time. It is a matter of some surprise to have my conclusions fully confirmed by no less an authority than General Hugh Johnson, the President's former administ rator of the N. R. A., and Baruch's former associate. He knows both Roos evelt and Bar- uch intimately, and his words are entitled to great weight. In a syndicated article in the pres s of April 18, 1939, he said: \"Freedom of speech and press, the right of assembly and petition and practically every guaranty of the bill of rights would go down automatically . . . \"If war comes soon, the Administration which has advo- cated these trends, if not these objects, would be continued another term, because of war. Having attained these objects because of war, how many of them would be relinquished at the coming of peace? \"Woodrow Wilson gave up most of his war powers im- mediately after the Armistice—because he detested them. Would the present Administration give them up, having greatly desired them? Has it ever willingly given up a single extraordinary emergency power since March 4, 1933? It would give up nothing of power . . . \"No matter who wins, the next world war will perma- nently destroy the democracy of every nation, that gets into it. If we want to save democracy for the world, we will keep out of European war.\" This is the key that explains the Jew deal, the Roosevelt de- flation, and every act of the Roosevelt Admini stration. Mr. "},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"99 Roosevelt has been \"On Our Way\" up to now, but when war is declared he will have reached his destinatio n. Congress and the State governments will then be cast aside and our dictators will be handed down to us instead of elected. Whether our sympathy is with the British or not, we must recognize that the prob abilities are that the President will drag us into the war unless Germany wins a quick victory. Even if we escape this war there is coc ky little Japan, re ady and willing to fight us at any time we wa nt to fight. The Jews are saying that such a war is inevitable. Th ere will undoubtedly be plenty of provocation for it, and if Mr. Roosevelt gets his third term we will soon be up to our necks in war. All of these elaborate preparations mean war, and war means that Roosevelt will be dict ator with Baruch and Morgen- thau as his assistants. It means the destruction of our republican form of government and the lo ss of our liber ties. Indeed, it must be admitted that our own morale is at the lowest ebb in our history. Hunger stalks thro ughout the land, and hunger has no patriotism; the farmer and the laborer have been corrupted by gratuities; the rich are notori ous cowards, a nd the poor are discouraged and beaten. These are the logical and intended con- sequences of the \"Jew Deal.\" By act of congress the State Militia (396,000 men) have been drafted into the United St ates Army. The act requires that they undergo one year of military training, and it author- izes the President to impress them into service at any place in the western hemisphere. These pa triotic men enli sted into the State Mliitia for servic e in their respective states, and congress is without legal authority to force them into the United States Army in time of peace. At this time (August 17, 1940) President Roosevelt, the Rothschild- power, and the Jewish press are endeavoring to drive through congress a conscrip tion bill known as the Burke- Wadsworth bill. This measure appears to have been written by one Grenville Clark of the law firm of Root, Clark, Buckner & Ballentine,—Morgan attorneys, a nd to have been inspired by the Jew, Julius Ochs Adler, general manager of the New York Times. It appears that on May 23, 1940 the said Morgan attorneys and Henry L. Stimsom (our pres ent Secretary of War and then attorney for Kuhn, Loeb & Co.) , Julius Ochs Adler and others "},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"100 held a conference at the Harvard Club in New York City and organized a drive for conscription. \"On the 3rd day of June they met again. They met to raise money . . . A quarter of a million dollars was raised at one time. Think of that—men raising a quarter of a million dollars to conscript boys in America.\"* The Record does not show who put up the quarter of a million dollars but it is a safe guess that a substantial part of it was subscribed by the Rothsc hilds' banks of Morgan & Co., and Kuhn, Loeb & Co. What for? What did they expect to buy with it? Not propaganda, for the Jew press are for conscription and no money was needed to obtai n that support. Five thousand dollars would have been more th an enough to ha ve covered all legitimate expenses of presenting the bill and the arguments in support of it, to co ngress. Another $10,000 should have been ample to have paid for the tele grams that they showered upon congressmen. This $15,000 ought to have covered also the taking of the Gallup poll. This po ll showed that 67% of the American people favored conscription,—which is simply preposterous. One of two things is true: either no poll was taken except of the few employees constituting the so-cal led \"Institute of Public Opin- ion,\" or else the poll wa s confined to the Jews. This Gallup poll is one of the greatest hoaxes that the Jew press have perpetrated upon the Am erican people. It is usually given front page public ity in the \"Jewspaper s.\" A poll is taken upon every subject that is of cu rrent interest to the public. Nobody knows anything about the voting until the result is announced. Nobody ever received a ballot or heard of anybody who received a ballot. To take a poll of our 131,000,000 Ameri- can people would require several weeks time and many thousand dollars. Apparently these Gallup polls are taken in 30 minutes time with an expense of less than 30 cents, and the result an- nounced is always as the Jew press de sire it to be. My estimate of $15,000 to cover the legitimate expenses of the conscription drive, plus the Ga llup poll, may be a trifle con- servative but surely th ey would not exceed $2 5,000, which leaves $225,000, for other purposes. Wh at are those purposes? *From Speech of Senator Holt, Congressional Record, Aug. 6, 1940, p. 15167."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"101 The corrupt purpose of these co nspirators is obvious. I do not know whether they could or did buy any congressional sup- ports hope not. I do no t care to comment on the subject further than to say that it is a horrible thing to sell the liberties of 12,- 000,000 men for $225,000. It is as cheap and as detestable as the betrayal of Christ for thirty pieces of silver; and the money appears to have been furnished in both instances by the Jews. This amazing revelation was scarcely discussed by the senators. Perhaps they were shoc ked speechless. It has not yet been denied, despite the fact th at our present Secretary of War was one of the conspirators. Senator Minton of Indiana de- fended the meeting and made a vicious personal attack on Senator Holt. Minton appears to have been supported by Bark- ley of Kentucky, Pepper of Flor ida, and Lee of Oklahoma. And thus the matter rests. The original conscription bill as written by Mr. Clark called for the registration of all men between the ages of 18 and 65, estimated at 42,000,000 men. From this vast number the Presi- dent was authorized to immedi ately impress into training and service 4,000,000 men. The measure was materially mo dified by the Senate Military Affairs Committee who fixed the age limit at 21 to 31, and the estimated number of men at 1 2,000,000, all of whom are sub- ject to draft for training and service for a period of ten years. The measure contemplates trai ning 1,000,000 men a year, at an estimated cost of $1,000,000,000.00 pe r annum for each 1,000,000 men. We have never had conscriptio n in this country except during brief war periods. All of the requirements for the army and navy in peace-time have been filled by voluntary enlistment. Conscription will never be necessary to repel invasion. It is not necessary now, nor is it legal now. Canada did not resort to cons cription for th e first twelve months of the present war. He r very recent conscription mea- sure limits the period of enlistment and trai ning to thirty days instead of twelve months, and Ca nada is now at war with Ger- many and we presumptively are not. Senator Norris, who heretofore has been a consistant sup- porter of the New Deal, says this of the conscription bill; \"It will bring about a radical change in the historic course we have taken since the birth of our Nation. As I see it, Mr. President, that change, if it takes place, will inevitably lead"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"102 us into a realm where we will have what we are complaining about in other nations—a dictatorship.

It is precisely for that reason—a dictatorship— that Henry L. Stimson, Frank Knox, Kuhn, Loeb & Co., Morgan & Co., and Julius Ochs Adler are spending their money for con- scription. It is for th at reason that the President of the United States has endorsed this bill and in employing the full power of his high office to put it over. * Congressional Record, Aug. 12, 1940, p. 15535."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"PART II.

There are certain unerring guides to a man's character, viz.: his associates and his work, \"t he way we do things.\" Gen- erally speaking, a man is no better than the people he chooses for his companions, (\"birds of a feather flock together,\") and he should always be judged by what he does. None of us can be judged by our pretensions and our professions, and this is par- ticularly true of politicians. This chapter will discuss briefly the President and his pals; his work will be discussed in gr eater detail in later chapters. I do not personally know the President and his intimate asso- ciates, but the late Huey P. Long knew them well and intimately. His judgment of men and his estim ate of them can be accepted with confidence, for he was fe arless and honest , and capable in his appraisements. He was originally a strong Roosevelt man and he is said to ha ve contributed more than any other one man to Roosevelt's first nominatio n;—indeed, such nomination ap- pears to have been due largely to Mr. Long's support and effort. He often referred to this achievement as one of his greatest mis- Lakes, regretfully saying that he swallowed Mr. Roosevelt with his blarney,—\"hook, line and sinker.\" He said of the President and his administration that it was but a continuation of the Hoover deflation administration under another name and in a slightly different form; that the difference between them was the difference between \"tweedle- dum and tweedledee\" and \"low cockalorum and high cocka- lorum.\" He stated in an interview that was publishd through- out the country that President Roosevelt is a \"liar and a four-"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"106 flusher\" and he challe nged an investigation by the United States Senate,—and no one acce pted the challenge. The \"kitchen cabinet\" is composed of the men behind the scene who actually run the gove rnment. The Roosevelt admin- istration up to this hour has been directed by his \"kitchen cab- inet. No important step has been taken, no important appoint- ment made, no important speech delivered, that has not first had the approval of one or more memb ers of his \"kitchen cabinet.\" They are here stated with thei r background, in the order of their apparent importance, as follows: Barney Baruch, Jew; New York stock gambler; Felix Frankfurter, Jew; New York; Judge U. S. Supreme Court; Henry Morgenthau, Jew; New York; Secretary of U. S. Treasury; Sam Roseman, Jew; New York judge; Roosevelt biographer; Ben Cohen, Jew; New York attorney; Harry L. Hopkins, New York; non-descript; —all deflationists, warmongers, and un-American. Baruch has often been called the assistant to the President. He is the most active and cunning of them all. It was reported that when Roosevelt was first elected Baruch planned to occupy one of the executive offices, bu t was advised against it; he had, however, just as well be th ere. Senator Long has furnish- ed us a striking description of him and his methods: \"There is such a thing as a bird flying when he sees you are going to shoot at him. We boys used to go out in the woods and try to get another kind of bird that does :not wait for you to get ready to get a shot at him, but flies before you ever get a gun in your hand. I remember one time when I tried to shoot an old crow that I saw. I was riding along in a buggy and saw the crow on top of an old log off in the field, so I just rode up right behind a thicket so the crow could not see me at all, and reached into my buggy to get th e gun to shoot, the crow. Thick as that thicket was, the minute my right hand got back near the gun the old crow flew away. (Laughter.) The minute Brother Barney Baruch saw this thing squiggling he \"got his\" and got out, and appeared before the committee and, oh, he was a good man, and we have not seen him since. (Laughter.) He stood with the Hoover Admi nistration until it was wrecked, inside and out. Mr. Hoover wa s flattened out worse than a pancake, and took his crusade over to Palo Alto, Calif., where, under the shade of the umbrellas, and cooled by the breezes wafted by the palms, he could sit and watch the wreckage, as old Nero watched the burning of Rome,—but old Brother Baruch came right on back down to the White House and got hold of another President."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"107 \"We have Presidents and Presidents, but Baruch goes on forever; and his clique, Baruch and Morgan, have managed to see to it that, notwithstanding the prerogatives and rights that have been granted to them, none have been granted to the two or three million soldiers who saved their hides.\"—Con- gresssional Record, 75th Congress, p. 7592. Elder Baruch was chairman of the War Industries Board during the period of World War I, and as such enjoyed the pow- er and the delights and perquisite s of being our Industrial Dic- tator. This rich, slick, wily and ambitious Jew stock-gambler aspires to again be our dictator, with political as well as econom- ic power. He could now be Secr etary of the Treasury, accord- ing to a press report, but he pref ers to let Elder Morgenthau hold that job, and to bide his time fo r a bigger one. There is reason to believe that he is the po litical agent of the Rothschilds. Morgenthau holds the most powerful and important posi- tion in the cabinet, viz: Secretar y of the Treasury. There is the foreign Viennese Jew, Felix Frankfurter, appointed Justice of the U. S. Supreme Court by Ro osevelt. Genera l Hugh Johnson said of him that he is \"the most powerful single individual in the United States.\" He estimated that Frankfurter is \"respon- sible for the appointment of 125 men to key position in the gov- ernment.\" The Jew Ben Cohen is one of hi s nominees. He ac- tually writes the reform bills that are designated as \"Administra- tion measures\" and that are tende red to Congress with presi- dential endorsement and usually adopted without material changes. The President is himself of Jewish extraction. He admits it. It is immaterial whether he is one-fourth or one-half Jew, for the taint of blood is like the \"leaven that leaveneth the whole lump.\" It is a biological fact that the hybrid inherits the char- acteristics of both breeds,—and Mr. Roosevelt is no exception to that rule. The mule provides a striking ex ample of the truth of this law of nature. There was never a mule that did not have the long ears and general appearance of the jack. It is said of the mule that he is without \"pride of ancestry or hop e of posterity.\" It is impossible to reproduce a ra ce horse from a combination of a scrub with a thoroughbred. We indulgent Americans do no t appreciate the importance of preserving the purity of our race. We think and speak indul- gently of the \"melting pot\" but to the extent we melt and merge"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"108 with inferior races we deteriorate. No one can imagine that a mulatto or a hybrid China-man would make a good ruler. It is not in the blood and it is impossible. We instinctively regard the mulatto as a Negro, no matter how white he may be in appear- ance. The hybrid Jew is likewi se a Jew and should be so re- garded. A celebrated authority says on that subject: \"Only one of (the great questions of the times) is of causal importance, that is, the question of the racial preser- vation of the nationality. In the blood alone there rests the strength as well as the weakness of man. As long as the people do not recognize and pay attention to the importance of their racial foundation, they resemble people who would like to teach the greyhound's qualities to poodles, without realizing that the greyhound's speed and the poodle's docility are quali- ties which are not taught, but are peculiar to the race . . . He who wants to redeem the people from the qualities and the vices which are alien to its original nature will have to redeem it first from the alien originators of these expressions. With- out the clearest recognition of th e race problem and, with it, of the Jewish question, there will be no rise of the German nation.\"* Mr. Hitler has resurrected the German nation upon that firm foundation. Even more than that he has redeemed prac- tically all of Europe. He has cr eated a new order that may be- come world-wide. His achieveme nts would have been impossi- ble upon the basis of Jew government and Je w finance such as we now have. The Jews and Communists seek to destroy this purity of blood. They preach and practice racial equality. There is never a children's movie that does not have one or more Negro picka- ninnies in it. Mrs. Eleanor Roos evelt is one of the leaders of the racial equality movement. She has had her picture taken with Negroes, entertains them in her home, and preaches Negro equality. It was stated in the press that the President is the direct descendant of a Holland Jewish family named Rosenvelt. The President was, of course, not ca lled upon to notice this slander, but he took the opportunity to do so. He said in substance, \"What of it? The Jews ar e as good as anybody else.\" It is unusual for a Gentile to admit Jewish blood. There was no reason for him to do so unless the charge was true. This taint of blood explains the President's Jewish companionships *\"'Mein Kampf,\" p. 469."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"109 and Jewishized Administration. It explains many of his Jewish characteristics:—his bluff and his blarney, his \"four-flushing\" and his duplicity, and his religious adherence to the program of the \"Learned Elders of Zion.\" The more important and unanswe red question is whether or not he is, in fact, a communist. It will be recalled that Dr. Wirt, a reputable educator, published an interview in which he stated that by invitation he attended a secret meeting of the \"brain trusters\" in which the subject of \"paving the way for a Com- munist Dictator\" was freely and frankly discussed. This caused a great \"tempest in a teapot.\" The President was at the time on a fishing excu rsion in Southe rn seas on the private yacht, Normahal, with his friend Vincen t Astor. He was met at the railroad station on his return by practically all of the democratic congressmen as a testimonial of their faith in him. He made them one of his char acteristic speeches in which he chided them with going from \"Wirt to Wirt\" in his absence. They appointed a Congressional Committee of Investigation, composed of the President's frie nds, who summoned before them several of the members of this meeting. They, of course, denied everything, the com mittee reported there was nothing to the charges, and the subject was la ughed off. But it now appears from the report of the Dies Committee that there are more than 700 federal employees holding ke y positions who are members of a \"communist front\" organiza tion, viz: the Le ague for Peace and Democracy. In a recent speech* Congressman Martin Dies, Chairman of the Dies Committee, said of this pretentious League: \"Conceived in Moscow, delivered in Amsterdam, nourished in its infancy in America by the famous French Communist, Henri Barbusse, the American League for Peace and Democ- racy has from its beginning served the interests of the Soviet Government. It has been the chief \"transmission belt\" for drawing \"innocents\" into the united front network of the Com- munist Party. It has fostered sabotage in our basic and war industries. It was intended to serve as a reserve force for the espionage activities of spies of the Soviet Government in the United States.\"* And so the brain-trusters, or a considerable number of them, are communists who are seekin g to overthrow our government *Congressional Record, Oct. 31, 1939."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"110 and to establish in place of it a di ctatorship. In view of the dis- closures of this report, the ve rdict of the Congressional Commit- tee exonerating these communist office-holders should be re- examined. The testimony before that committee was uncontradicted that they did have a meeting an d that Dr. Wirt was invited to this meeting and attended it. It was also uncontradicted that they did discuss the subject of dictatorship. The principal difference between Dr. Wirt's testimony and th at of the other participants in the meeting who testified was that Dr. Wirt testified that they said that Roosevelt was the \"Kerensky\" who would pave the way for a real dictator—a Stalin—w hich they denied. In view of the fact that it is a part of the code of the communists to lie and deceive, (as was found by the Dies Committee) we should accept Dr. Wirt's testimony as true. Despite the revelations of the Dies Committee we still have at least 680 communists in Wash ington on the government pay- roll who are \"boring from within \" and seeking the destruction of our government, and paving the way for a dictator. By a word President Roosevelt co uld have them all removed from office, but he has not spoken that word. Why does he tolerate these traitors and their nefarious work? There is and can be but one answer, and that is th at he is in sympathy with what they are doing. They are there to take over when the occasion arises. This throws some ligh t upon the efforts of the President and his wife to suppress and discredi t the work of this committee. Mrs. Roosevelt is also a very decided \"pink\" or a red. She withdrew from the D. A. R. because one of its chapters refused the use of its hall to a Negro singer. She made a speech at the convention of one of the communist \"front\" organizations in Birmingham advocating Negro equality and the repeal of the Jim Crow law. She also defended the Jewish race in the Dec. 31, 1938, issue of \"Liberty Magazine,\" arguing that the Jews are smarter than the Gentiles and that the Gentiles are envious of them and persecute them for that reason. Mrs. Roosevelt appeared befo re the Dies Committee with communist leaders who were summoned as witnesses by the committee and were there for the purpose of giving testimony. This unusual procedur e on the part of the \"First Lady\" was for one of two purposes: either to show he r disapproval of the action of the committee and to in timidate them, or else to give "},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Ill the communists the benefit of her sympathy and support, and to encourage them. Mrs. Roosevelt's maiden name was also Roosevelt, she is the President's cousin as well as his wife, and has the same Jewish blood in her veins. At a recent convention of the Na- tional Youth Congress, composed of communists of all ages from youths in their teens to ag ed men and women, she appeared on the stage with them and entert ained many of them as guests at the White House. The President has been a politic ian all of the years of his life and has had Jewish support during that entire period of time. By profession he is a lawy er but has neve r distinguished himself in that capacity. So far as the record reveals, he has never had a client or tried a lawsuit. For a time Mr. Roosevelt was vi ce president of a \"fly-by- night\" insurance company, and for another period of time he was president of United States In vestors, Ltd., a swindling syn- dicate that sold the public worthl ess Jewish-manipulated German currency. He inherited a fortune that was acquired by his Jew- ish ancestry, some of whom we re money lenders. When out of office he has lived with mamma and been supported by mamma on Granpa Rosenvelt's money. This is a condensed true story of the life of our glamorous, ambitious, warrior President.

The aristocracy, which enjoyed by law the labour of the workers, was interested in seeing that the workers were well fed, healthy and strong. We are interested in just the opposite—in the diminution, the killing out of the Goyim.\"—From Protocol 3. There can be no understanding of Communism and Bol- shevism without an un derstanding of the Je wish question, for they emanate from the Jew as truly as does our banking and cur- rency system. Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, the founders of Communism, were both Jews . Communism is an essential part of the program of the \"Elders\" for the conquest of the world; just as essential as gold. They employ their banking and currency system to create poverty and unrest, and com- munism to wreck and destroy. This explains the riddle of the Lamont family. Thos. W. Lamont, a partner of J. P. Morg an & Co., was our representative to the Brussels financial conference that sought to establish the gold standard throughout the world. His son, Corliss Lamont, is an active communist. Both father and son are working for a dictatorship; the father laid the foundation for it, and the son carries on the active work. I do not mean to imply that all communists are Jews or that all Jews are communists, but I do mean to say that the communist leaders are Jews an d the Jew leaders communists. How otherwise can we explain the financing of Lenin and Trotsky by Schiff and Warbur g? How otherwise can we ex- plain the \"Jew deal\" which wa s concocted by Baruch, Frank- furter, et al., and put over by Roosevelt? Take the Jews and Jew money out of the communist party and you take out its living, propelling force; it would die overnight. The active campaign to comm unize America began imme- diately following the treaty of recognition of Russia. This treaty provided, acco rding to press report s, which may or may not be true, that the Soviets would not attempt to sovietize "},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"113 America, but that meant nothing to them. It is one of their boasted, cardinal principles, that the end sanctifies the means, and that they may lie, steal and murder to accomplish their ends. Prior thereto our government and most of the govern- ments of the world refused to recognize the Russian govern- ment because it supports the Th ird Internationale, a political organization for the propagation of communism. It is this or- ganization which is financing th e communist movement in this country, which means that the Ru ssian government is doing so. This infamous treaty was c oncluded between two Jewish communists, viz., Franklin D. Roosevelt and Maxim Litvinoff (Finkelstein), for the pretende d purpose of trade but for the real purpose of undermining an d destroying our republican form of government. It has not materially increased trade, but it has enormously increased communism and crime. Maxim Litvinoff is an avow ed, full-blooded Jew, and a red communist; Roosevelt is a hybrid and a pink communist; the difference between them being only one of degree. Mr. Roosevelt has recently made some important changes in his cabinet. He fired ex-Gove rnor Woodring as Secretary of War because he was opposed to selling our army and navy war equipment to England, and was opposed to our declaring war against Germany. He appointed in his place, Henry L. Stim- son of New York, for the reason that he favors our interven- tion in the war and our rendering every possible aid to Eng- land. He also appointe d Col.

The cabinet is presumed to represent the people of the United States and to be selected from different sections of the country. Who is represented here except the Jews? And what sections except the cities of New York and Chicago ? What chance is there for us to keep out of the war with these Jews, Jew-in-laws and pro-Jews in charge of our govern- ment? The cards are stacked against us. It is not the people of England that they are seeking to rescue, but it is the Jews of Europe. It is not th e British Empire they are trying to save, but it is the Jewish Empire they are seek ing to preserve and promote. All of this war hysteria, war expenditure, and war taxes are primarily for that purpose. It is reported that there are 18,000 Jews and many thou- sand communists holding government positions in Washington. It is not yet quite as bad as it was in Russia before the purge, where it said that 76% of the Jewish population held gov- ernment jobs. The most outrageous of all the President's ap- pointments was that of the Je w-Communist, Felix Frankfurter, to the Supreme bench. Frankfurter is the reputed author of the N. R. A. and other new deal legi slation, and will, of course, as a judge, sustain their validity. Wors e than that, he is an active \"Elder\" and an active member of the \"American Civil Liberties Union,\" a communist organization whose object is to impair and destroy our government. The United Mine Workers make the following report as to the purposes of the \"American Civil Liberties Union\": \"Active among the 'intellectual' classes of the country, and posing as a champion of the 'liberties of speech, press, and as- sembly,' is the American Civil Liberties Union at New York. This organization is working in harmony and unity with the Communist super-structure in America, engaged in the dissem- ination of radical utterances and propaganda, and conducting a nationwide campaign for the liberation of Bolshevik agents and disloyal agitators who have been convicted under the war-time laws, or the syndicalist laws of different states, for unpatriotic or revolutionary activities.\"* This report is fully sustaine d by the evidence reported by the Dies Committee. Roger Baldwin, the national director of this \"Liberties Union,\" testified that it advocate d the overthrow *Quoted from Senate Doc. 14, 68th Congress, Page 7."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"115 of our government \"by force an d violence,\" and \"murder and assassination.\" It appears also from this evidence that both Felix Frankfurter and Harold Icke s are members of it. It also appears that it is allied with and supports the \"International Labor Defense Organization\" which is the legal department of the Communist Party. (See Report of the Dies Committee, pages 83-86.) It is this latter organiza tion that defended Mooney, and Sacco and Van Zetti an d the murderers of the officers at Gastonia,—Marion, Nort h Carolina, and the Negroes in the Scottsboro case. They were all convicted communist murderers, except the Negroes, who were convicted for th e rape of a white woman. These dastardly convicted criminals have been lionized by the Jew press as if they were persecuted heroes. The President appointed Kamerads Frankfurter and Ickes to two of the highest offices in our government. He must have known when he appointed them that they were communists and advocate the overthrow of our government. If he did not have this knowledge in the beginning he has it now, and he has not called for their resignatio ns. He must have ha d it in the begin- ning, for they are hi s intimate bosom frie nds and are frequent visitors in his home. In its report filed Jan. 3, 194 0, the Dies Committee reports the following findings: \"According to one of the recent minutes of the Washing- ton, D. C, branch of the Amer ican League, it was decided to 'set up League committees in th e units of Government agen- cies with our present membership in those agencies as a nucleus.' These nuclei of the League are now formed in more than a score of Government agen cies. H. C. Lamberton, chair- man of the \"Washington branch of the League, testified under oath before the committee that there are 700 Government em- ployees who are members of the American League for Peace and Democracy.\"* The committee further reports: \"American League for Peace and Democracy.—The com- mittee finds on the basis of overwhelming and conclusive evi- dence that the American League for Peace and Democracy is a Communist \"front\" organization . . . \"These self-styled Social Democrats pledged themselves to work for civil war in their respective countries in the event of another international conflict.\"* *Report 1476, House Representatives, 76th Congress, 3rd Session."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"116 The committee further reports that this organization (Am- erican League for Peace and De mocracy) is financed by the Communist Party. Thus it appears that this is a militant organi- zation, not for peace but for war; that its real purpose is to promote a revolution to overthrow our government when we become entangled in war, which means that if Mr. Roosevelt inveigles us into World War II th at this organizat ion will then get actively to work to overthrow our government. \"There are 700 Government empl oyees . . . in more than a score of Government agencies\" who are set and ready to go when the occasion arises and th e command is given. If Mr. Roosevelt did not know that these employees were communists and revolutionaries wh en they were appoin ted, he knows it now because this official report is available to him and his inter- est in the subject is such that he has undoubtedly read it. The President has clandestinely subjected us to the juris- diction of the \"World Court,\" co rrectly called \"the back door to the League of Nations,\" despite our refusal to join either the League or the Court. By proc lamation issued August 24, 1924, the President accepted membership in the International Labor Organization on behalf of the United States. This organization is a creature of the League of Nations, composed exclusively of members of the League. One of its purposes is to standardize the hou rs and wages of labor through- out the world, and its decisions are subject to review only by the world court and not by our Supreme Court.* It can hardly be called a coincidenc e that John L. Lewis now seeks to carry out in America the mand ates of the I. L. O. The President is now eniployi ng the full power of his office to communize the labor organizations of America. He called the officials of the A. F. L. and the C. I. 0. in conference at the White House and told them in substance to get together or else he would find means of forcing them to do s o. So far the A. F. L. has bravely refused to yield to this pressure. Jno. P. Frey, a member of this conference, stated in the press that the terms of union offered the A. F. L, by th e C. I. O. are precisely those proposed by the communists two years ago. This is what the Special Comm ittee of Investigation of the United Mine Workers of America said of the program of the Communists: "},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"117 \"The major points in this revolutionary program of the Communists are: (1) Overthrow and destruction of the Federal, state, and provincial governments, with the elimination of existing con- stitutional forms and foundations. (2) Establishment of a Soviet dictatorship, absolute in its exercise of power, owing al legiance to, and conceding the authority only of the Communist, or Third International, at Moscow, as a \"governmental\" substitute. (3) Destruction of all social, economic, and political in- stitutions as they exist at this time. (4) Seizure of all labor unions through a process of \"boring from within' them, and utilizing them as a strategic instrument in fulfillment of their revolutionary designs upon organized and constitutional government.\" * * * \"The revolutionary leaders in America are making a na- tion-wide attempt to obtain cont rol of the American Federa- tion of Labor, reorganize the craft unions on the basis of 'one big union' in an industry, and weld them into the central revo- lutionary agency in America.\" (Senate Document No. 14, 68th Congress, pages 2 and 6.) During this long and much publicized controversy between John L. Lewis and Wm. Green, we have heard a great deal about \"one big union\" and \"cra fts union\"—Lewis' organization being a \"one big union\" organi zation and Green's a \"crafts union.\" That is now, and has been from the beginning, the fundamental difference between them. But we did not know that the \"one big union\" is a communist scheme for satbotag- ing American institutions and the American government. This report of the United Mine Workers is cited with approval by the Dies Committee. The Dies report mentioned says this of the C. I. O. \"With the formation of the C. I, O. the principal efforts of the Communists were turned in the direction of that organi- zation . . . The evidence before the committee indicates, how- ever, that the leadership of some 10 or 12 of the constituent unions of the C. I. O. out of a total of some 48 unions is more than tinged with communism. The evidence shows that some of their leaders are either card-holding members of the Commun- ist Party or subservient followers of that party's 'line'.\" It is Stalin's plan to overt hrow the American government through one huge labor organizati on. In order to bring this about it is necessary to communize the A. F. L., which he has in the past vainly tried to do. He promoted the C.

L., the next best thing is to amalgamate the two, and through \"boring from within\" to finally communize organized labor. Is not that also the purpose of the President of the United States? If that is not his purpose then why has he sought to bring about a coalition between two rival labor organizations, not once but repeatedly and pe rsistently? The answer and the only answer is that it is the program of the protocols, of the Third Internationale, and of th e Communist party. They seek to create one huge labor organizati on and to gain control of it, and through it to ov erthrow our government. Ezra Chase, a communist organizer, testified be fore the Dies Committee that the Communistic plan for subjugating America was to bring about a general strike in case of war, and thereby to bring about revolution. And who will be our dictator ? Who now, and for the past seven years has been working feverishly to obtain the powers of a dictator? Who has bankrupted our national government and the people of America in order to bring about revolution and dictatorship? None other than the man who arose from a bad dream in the middle of the night to inform the American people that he was not suited for the job of dictator,—when nobody had accused him of it. None ot her than the man who for the first time in the history of our country now seeks to be elected President for a third term."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"XIX. Report of the Dies Committee \"Who and what is in a position to overthrow an invisible force? And this is precisely what our force is. Gentile mason- ry, blindly serves as a screen for us and our objects, but the plan of action of our force, even its very abiding-place, remains for the whole people an unknown mystery.\"From Protocol 4. The House of Representatives appointed a committee to investigate \"Un-Americ an activities,\" known as the Dies Com- mittee. This committee is composed of the following members, viz: Martin Dies, Chairman, (Texas) ; Joe Starnes (Alabama) ; John J. Dempsey (New Mexico) ; Jerry Voorhis (California) ; Jas. E. Casey (Massachusetts) ; N. M. Mason (Illinois) ; and J. Parnell Thomas (New Jersey). The first four named are Demo crats and the latter three Republicans, but the committee ne vertheless filed a unanimous report. The committee started out by in vestigating Nazi activities. It appears from their report that there is a \"German American Bund\" that has some connection with the German government. It states that Fritz Kuhn places the membership at 20,000 to 25,000, but that the Department of Justice estimate d it at 6500 in 1937. There is also an \"American Italian Black Shirt Legion,\" about 10,000 strong. While the comm ittee finds that the German Bund \"must be classified as an agent of a foreign government\" there was no evidence or finding to the effect that it is seeking the overthrow of our government . On the other hand, the pur- pose of the German Bund appears to be to develop loyalty to both their fatherland an d their adopted country. So long as the committee confin ed its investigation to Nazi activities everything wa s fine and lovely, but when it turned to the Communist what a howl went up from the Jewish press and leaders—led by Franklin D. Roos evelt, Harold Ickes, and Madam Perkins. In the beginning it was, \"O noble judge! O excellent young man! O wise and upright judge! How much more elder art thou than thy looks! \"Ay, his breast: So says the bond:—doth it not, noble judge?— 'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.\""},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"120 But when the committee began to examine the record of the Communists, the President, fr om his high office, denounced and belittled them; something un precedented in American his- tory. Why? Answer that to you r satisfaction if you still be- lieve in the sincerity of Franklin D. Roosevelt. There is but one answer and that is that the President wanted to suppress the investigation of the Commun ists and to disparage the re- port of the committee. Why should he want to do that? No answer except that he is a Communist and he does not want the truth revealed. He wants the Communists to succeed in their secret, nefarious work. Whatever else may be said of Mr . Roosevelt, he is no fool. He and his Jewish advisers know what they want and how to get it, and they are working adroitly a nd secretly and relentlessly to accomplish their ends. If the President and Secretary Perkins do not stand for sabotage a nd communism, why do they so steadfastly refuse to deport the alien red, Bridges, and others of his kind? Be it said to the everlasting credit of the Dies Committee and the House of Representatives that the committee was not swayed or intimidated by this fu lmination of the President, and that the House by an overwhelming majority re-appointed them, and by a vote of 320 to 27 approp riated sufficient funds to con- tinue their work. I quote from the report of the Dies Committee liberally be- cause the subject is one of such vital importance to us all: \"We have shown that communism is a world-wide revo- lutionary movement aiming ultimately at the setting up of a world union of soviet socialist republics. This is a proposition which is beyond dispute. It is substantiated by voluminous lit- erature of the Communists themselves . . . \"The Communist code of ethics not only permits, but actu- ally glorifies as virtuous, su ch immoralities as perjury, de- struction of property, the beating and maiming of workers who refuse to follow the dictates of the Communists, shoot- ings, stabbings, kidnappings, and bombings. It is even a matter of boasting among Communists that Stalin robbed banks in the days before the Communist regime was set up in Russia. \"To summarize: The Communist code of ethics is based upon the principle that the ends of revolution justify any means, no matter how lawless, violent, dishonest, or indecent from the standpoint of accepte d American standards of mor- ality.\"* *House Report No. 2, 76th Congress, 1st Session, pages 26 and 29."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"121 How familiar this sounds. This is the cruel, diabolical code of the \"Elders\" called the \"Proto cols.\" They represent the same plan for subjugating peoples and governments, and establishing their kingdom of the elders. They both originated in distorted Asiatic minds and are both fo unded upon the philosophy of the Talmud.* The committee summarized their findings in part as follows: \"Whereas it once employed the frank slogan of \"the De- fense of the Soviet Union,\" it works today to embroil this country in a foreign war by the propagation of the doctrine of 'collective security.' \"It seeks ultimately the overthrow of the American form of government as established by the Constitution of the United States. \"It aims to set up a dictatorship of the proletariat in this country, notwithstanding its pres ent tactical silence on this fundamental tenet of communism . . . \"It hides behind civil liberties in pursuing ends which will destroy civil liberties for all but the ruling few of the prole- tarian dictatorship . . . \"It stifles the creative impulses of the individual by its deadening regimentation . . . \"It seeks to sabotage and cripple our economy on every possible front, with a view to its profiting by the resulting economic crises . . . \"It has penetrated the Government itself, with the result that some Communists hold hey positions in Federal agencies and projects . . . \"It aims to incite race war by its special agitation among the Negro population of this country . . . \"It seeks to silence all hostile criticism by charging its critics with red-baiting, while, at the same time, it viciously baits those who dare oppose it . . . \"It dangles the promise of economic security before the victims of economic distress, offering them a new slavery in the name of emancipation.\"** That is precisely what th e New Deal is now doing. The findings read like a chap ter taken from the protocols. They have the same philosophy, the same objective, and advocate the-same methods as set out in the protocols.

The number of communists in th e United States is variously estimated at from two to ten million. This report of the Dies Committee and the previous repor t of the Committee reveal the fact that the communists have many organizations under high- sounding and attractive names, in addition to the Communist Party which is avowedly communistic; that all of these organi- zations are abundantly supplied wi th money for their work, the greater part of which is furnished by Moscow. It is reported that there ar e now 80 times as many com- munists in America as there were in Russia when the Russian government was overthrown, and three and one-half times more than there are in Russia today; that they have in the United States 800 national organizations with th ousands of branches having an estimated membership of 6,500,000; that they have 600 newspapers and magazines pr inted in all languages and circulated regularly in the Unite d States; that they own publish- ing houses, book stores, film laborato ries and theatres, etc., that they maintain 200 national so-called cultural movements, 62 na- tional communist youth movements and 33 national so-called de- fense movements; and that they spend an estimated $10,000,000 annually in the United Stat es to promote civil war.* *See Report of Walter S.

Even if it has 25,000 members, and even if they are actively at work (and the report of the committee does not disclose it) they are a mere bagatelle as compared with the activities of the communists. It is the contenti on of the Bund leaders that they are combatti ng communism and that that is the purpose of their organization. Undoubtedly George Deatheridge, Robt. E. Edmondson, James True, General George Van Horn Mo sely, Col. E. N. Sanctuary, Gerald B. Winrod, Win. Dudley Pelley, and Chas. B. Hudson are fighting communism. They are not racketeers, as the com- mittee intimates; they are not \"se lling religious and racial hat- red,\" as the committee states. It does not add to the dignity and weight of this report for the committee to go out of its way to besmear these patriots who are en deavoring to render a service to their country in its hour of great peril. General George Van Horn Mosely submitted a strong state- ment to the committes in which he showed conclusively that this communism that now confront s us and which the committee so clearly portrays and forcefully condemns, is of Jewish origin and is financed and promot ed by Jews.

It is because of the \"invisible power and its abiding-place.\" I do not wish to detract in the least from the committee's very able report. They have honestly and courageously revealed a threatening situation that we did not know existed. In pass- ing judgment upon their work we s hould take into consideration the invisible power that rules our country and our government. Already this power has publicly threatened to contribute $250,- 000 to defeat Martin Dies, chai rman of the committee, in his present race for re-election. This invisible force \"whose abiding place is unknown\" has the power to defeat any member of this committee for office, and the power to elect a president of the United States.

All of this pernicious activity by many agencies to sub- vert our government, in the final analysis reaches back to that head. No foreigner should be admitted to citizenship or to hold office, whether Jew or Gentile. We, the American people are the \"chosen people,\" and not the Jews and the foreigners. We are capable of running our own gove rnment in our own way without their help; and they are not capab le of doing so. They have not had the necessary training, and a few years of residency here does not imbue them with our spirit of morality and government.

We have barred other Asiatics,— Japanese, Chinese, etc. Why not the Jews? They are less de- sirable than the Chinese and Japanese because they are shrewd- er, more destructive, and their goa l is to fleece us and to destroy our government.

Tammany Hall is not the good old Irish Catholic organiza- tion that it used to be. Corrupt as it has always been reputed to be, it is infinitely worse now. There was some limit to its graft, even in the days of Boss Tweed, but there is none now. Jno. J. Hines, recently convicted of graft, was the dispenser of relief funds for th e Roosevelt regime in New York City. He was an appropriate and an artistic administrator of these funds. The corruption was so foul and ro tten that it a ppears to have turned the stomach of even so tough a politician and so loyal a friend as Jim Farley. It is the philosophy of the Roosevelt regime to \"tax, tax, tax, and spend, spend and spend, and elect, elec t and elect.\" According to the press reports Harry Hopkins, our former relief administrator and present Secr etary of Commerce, actually boasted of it,—which he of cour se denied. Whenever they make a slip and give us a glimpse of what they propose to do to us it is always a \"damned lie\" or a \"deliberate lie.\" Everywhere it is bribery a nd corruption.

Unclean!' and determine that so far as lies within our power we will put the bars up against a repetition or recurrence of such practices.\" Never before this regime have we had anything like it. We have never before had a President whose family personally profited or sought to profit through his prestige and power.

Jimmy Roosevelt's enormous profits from the insura nce firm of Sargent & Roose- velt. Insurance is a favorite met hod of graft because it is semi- legitimate, easily concealed, and the \"picking\" is rich. A suit was filed by a firm of insurance br okers against a Boston bank for $25,000 for insurance premiums, alleging that they were entitled to these premiums and that the bank had diverted them corrupt- ly to Roosevelt & Sargent in or der to obtain favors from the Roosevelt administration. The above quotation from Senator Tobey was about insur- ance that a ship-building company had been forced to place with the son of a powerful Washington official, without naming the father or the son. If it was not Jimmy there must be others in the same game, but the probabi lity is that it was Jimmy. Shortly before or after this exposure by the Saturday Eve- ning Post, Jimmy was made secr etary to the President and a Colonel in the Marines. The la tter position is a sinecure since he performs no service, but it carries a salary of $10,000,—a rather generous gift from Dad, of the despised taxpayers money. Jimmy held the position of secr etary to the President only a short time when he resigned to become associated in some capacity with Samuel Goldwyn of the movies. (It is a matter of conjecture whether he resigned his position as Colonel of the Marines with its $10, 000 salary.) The press reported that this change was made because of the affection recently developed between the Jew, Sam Goldwyn, and Colonel Jimmy. It appears to have been a case of love at first sight. It has since developed that indictments were pending against Sam Goldwyn and others fo r violation of the anti-trust laws, and that Jimmy was made a defendant in these bills of indictment. Does anyone imag ine for a moment that Jimmy will be prosecuted, convicted and punishe d? How can he be released without releasing the others? These slick Jews don't pay big salaries from love and affe ction; it is always quid pro quo with them. But Jimmy proved a di sappointment. He did not get the anti-trust suit dismissed and the love match is over.

From these activities she is receiving large emoluments;—not by virtue of her ability, for she is mediocre, but because she is the wife of the Presdient of the United States.

In the language of Puck: \"O what fools these mortals be!\" We are now suffering from a transitional period when the Jews are attempting to create an \"intensified centralization of government,\" and to \"regulate m echanically all the actions of the political life by new laws.\" They are seeking to bring this change about by lies and corruption. Everything they propose is explained with a lie and often sugar-coated with corruption. The most dastardly form of th is corruption is that of the youth of the land. Rabbi Reichhorn said in his oration to the Jews: \"But above all let us monopolize Education. By this means we spread ideas that are useful to us, and shape the children's brains as suits us.\"* When the Learned Elders came to write out their plan of conquest, for their own instruc tion and guidance, they said on that subject: \"We have got our hands . . . into education as being the corner-stone of a free existence.

Federal Reserve System \"The present issue of money in general does not corres- pond with the requirements per head, and cannot therefore satisfy all the needs of the workers. The issue of money ought to correspond with the growth of population and thereby chil- dren also must absolutely be reckoned as consumers of curren- cy from the day of their birth. The revision of issue is a material question for the whole world.\"—From Protocol 20. The expansion and contraction of currency and credit is the method of the Elders for ab sorbing the wealth of the world, and it is the surest and quickes t plan. Compound interest would eventually do so except for the increasing supply of the precious metals and increasing wealth. This method, as certain as it is, is too slow for the \"learned,\" greedy, and ambitious Elders. By expansion and contraction of curr ency and credit the rich are always made richer and the poor are made poorer; and the pos- sessions of the weak are acquired by th e strong, and thus great wealth and great poverty are created. Obviously, a country can not be subjected to currency and credit manipulation that has a sufficient quantity of money or currency in circulation, for cred it is directly dependent on the quantity of money in circulatio n;—the more money the greater the basis of credit; the less mone y the less the basis of credit. Credit is, of course, dependent upon the will of both the man who seeks the credit and the one who extends it, bu t it will not be sought or extended if there is thought to be an inadequate volume of money for its redemption. It is essentia l in order to control at will the ex pansion and contraction of credit that there be some supreme auth ority with the power to increase or de- crease at will th e volume of money in circulation. Prior to the regime of the Ro thschilds this power resided in the kings and emperors of th e world, for they were then the supreme authority. In our country our National Constitution vested this power in the Congre ss of the United States. At the time of the adoption of our National Cons titution state banks issued their currency notes payable in gold and silver which cir- culated as currency, and this sy stem continued until after the Civil War. This state bank curre ncy added materially to the volume of money in circulation and to the stability of credit and of values. Since the Civil War and until recently National "},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"132 banks issued their currency notes, based upon United States bonds and redeemable by the national government, which cir- culated as currency and which contributed materially to the supply of money and the stab ility of credit and of values. Under the Rothschild influen ce the banking systems of the world were all radically cha nged. The supreme authority to issue money, as well as to extend credit, was transferred by the various governments to the bankers of their respective countries. The Bank of England became the model for other central banks of the world. At the time of the establishment of the Federal Reserve System our government was the only one of any c onsequence that even pretended to exercise its so vereign right to issue and con- trol the volume of money in circulation. The establishment of the Federal Reserve System operated as a complete surrender to the banking fraternity of the s overeign power of the American people to regulate values through their congressional representa- tives, as guaranteed to them by their national constitution. The panic of 1907 was, like all of our other panics, a manip- ulated one. It was brought abou t by the refusal of the reserve banks of New York to pay currency to their country bank depositors, which in turn made it necessary for these banks to refuse to pay their depositors in currency. It was therefore due primarily to an insufficient quan tity of currency in circulation and an inadequate method of increasing the supply. There was universal demand for a change of the system and for an adequate volume of money to meet the demands of com- merce. Congress appointed a co mmittee, called the Monetary Commission, with Senator Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island as chairman, to study the banking systems of the world and to report its findings. This committee made one or more trips to Europe and some two years after its appointment filed an ex- haustive report of mo re than four thousand pages, which was never read by anybody. In the meantime the bankers and the various commercial b odies and the farmers and the laborers in their conventions, and th e politicians and the press were all with one voice demanding a banking and currency system that would make future panics and depressions impossible. The keynote of President Wilson's campaign for the presi- dency in 1912 was the reform of our banking and currency sys- tem and he was elected upon that issue. Immediately after his "},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"133 election he submitted that subject to Congress in a very strong message, pointing out the inadequa cy of the existing system and the necessity for a system that would provide an adequate supply of currency and credit to meet the demands of industry and commerce and that would insure th e full employment of labor, and high prices and wages. Hi s message and his campaign speeches all indicated that he had a keen unders tanding of the money question and that he desired to esta blish a system that would afford an adequate volu me of money and credit, and would sustain high prices and wages. There then followed a great st ruggle, feigned or real, be- tween the big city bankers and the Administration. The bankers sought to establish a central bank with power to control cur- rency and credit and with themse lves in control of the bank. They threatened that if this was not done that they would de- nationalize and would have nothing whatever to do with the sys- tem. The Administration apparent ly sought to reserve to the government its sovereign power to issue money and to establish a decentralized banking system to supply credit. The question of the conditions under which new currency would be issued and whether or not the currency note should be a bank note or a gov- ernment note were important issues in the struggle. The original Federal Reserve Act emerged as a result of this controversy. The big banks without a single exception were satisfied and accepted this system . President Wilson and Secre- tary McAdoo were appa rently satisfied with it. President Wil- son said of it, that it was a charter of freedom to commerce and industry and that men could go forward with their unde rtakings with assurance and without fear that their possessions would be taken from them by the contra ction of currency and credit. In the midst of this campaign for the reform of our bank- ing and currency system Paul Wa rburg, a German Jew, migrated from Frankfort-on-Main, the origin al home of the Rothschilds, to America. He was at the tim e a member of the Rothschild banking firm in Frankfort-on-Main and he became a member of Kuhn, Loeb & Company in New Yo rk, the American branch of the Rothschilds, upon his arriva l here. The following is the Naval Secret Service report on him in December, 1918: \"Warburg, Paul, New York City, German; was natural- ized an American citizen 1911, was decorated 1912 by the Kaiser; was vice-chairman of United States Federal Reserve Board; is a wealthy and influential banker; handled large"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"134 sums furnished by Germany for Lenin and Trotsky; subject has a brother who is leader of the espionage system (of Germany).\" The brother here mentioned was Felix, who afterward mi- grated here and was a member of Kuhn, Loeb & Co., and Chief of the American Elders. Soon af ter his arrival in New York Paul Warburg called in conference the leading New York bankers and submitted to them a plan for the reform of our banking and currency system, wh ich they enthusiastic ally endorsed. It was then submitted to the Aldr ich Monetary Commission and approved by the commission, despite the fact that they had spent two years of study and filed a four thousand page report on the subject. It was in its essential fe atures the charter of the Bank of England. The Aldrich Monetary Commission submitted this plan to Congress in the form of a bill known as the Aldrich Bill. The Democrats immediately ar rayed themselves solidly against it. There was great opposi tion to it throughout the land, because it was openly and brazenly a centralized banking system that vested the bankers with th e sovereign power to issue and control the volume of money, and because also of our very sad ex- perience with the First and Second Banks of the United States. Upon this issue primarily the Republican Party was defeated and President Wilson and the Co ngressional Democratic candi- dates elected. It thereupon became necessary to revise and rewrite the Aldrich Bill and to at least camouflage it in order to make it acceptable to the country. Frank A. Vanderlip, then President of the National City Bank, gives an account of this revision in his memoirs. It appears theref rom that he and Henry Davison of J. P. Morgan & Company, an d Paul Warburg of Kuhn, Loeb & Company held a secret confer ence on Jekyll Island (how ap- propriate the name) near Savann ah, Georgia, and that they then and there rewrote the bill conforming it in appearance to the requirements of President Wi lson and the Democratic Party, but preserving the substance of the Aldrich Bill. The honor, such as it is, for this iniquitous bill is claimed by many people. The Republicans claim it because it was in fact the Aldrich Bill in disguise, an d the Democrats because it was in fact endorsed and adopted by a Democratic Administration. Carter Glass claims it because he was then Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committ ee and it bore in part his "},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"135 name. Paul Warburg claimed it because it was in fact his baby and he acknowledg ed it as such. He suppli ed the frame work of it, which was colored and mildly altered by Vanderlip and Davi- son. But President Wilson and McAdoo and Glass had prac- tically nothing to do w ith it except to pilot it through Congress. The Federal Reserve System is the product of the Roths- childs and its adoption was secured in the same underground, de- ceptive manner that they always employ to obtain their objec- tives. Paul Warburg evidently came to America to reform our banking and currency system and evidently he and the Roths- child interest then anticipated the world war, although it did not come about until some three years later. They, of course, knew that su ch war would necessarily pro- duce great expansion of currency and credit and of values and that money would be cheapened accordingly and that a \"killing\" could be made by contracting it. They also knew that America as the producer and seller of food and war materials would re- ceive vast quantities of gold in payment for them. They also knew that under our financial syst em as it then existed this great influx of gold would enor mously increase our volume of money and basis of credit, that money would be correspondingly cheapened and values increased and that great and permanent prosperity in America would be the inevitable re sult, and that this inflation and prosperity would likely exte nd to all other countries. It was, therefore, nece ssary to their plans to sterilize this gold and to put the Americ an banking and currency system on a credit basis and to bring it under their own control. This is the sordid story of th e greatest disaster that ever befell the American people. We then surrendered to Jeroboam Rothschild and his successors, complete dominion over our cur- rency and credit, over prices and wages, and over our welfare and happiness. Prior thereto he had great influence through his Morgan & Co., and Kuhn, Loeb & Co., banks and their subsidi- aries and affiliates, but now his authority is made supreme and unlimited. This surrender perfected his control over the econ- omy of all the people of the world. "},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"136 XXII.

The language and the phrases of the original Federal Re- serve act were so obscure and ambiguous, that President Wilson and Congress may have been deceived into believing that it was in fact what it pretended to be . It may be that the President accepted it as being in his ju dgment an improvement over the then existing system and as being the best bill he could then get. It may be that he expected to later perfect it by amendment and to make it the reliable se rvant of commerce and industry and of the people, and not their tyrannical master. If such was the President's purpose it has operated \"the other way around.\" It has been pe rfected, it is true, but it has been perfected as a central bank with the sovereign power in the \"Federal Reserve Board\" to \"issue money and control the value thereof\" in pl ain violation of our National Constitution. Every perfecting ame ndment that the Elders have wanted has been adopted by a complais ant Congress until it now has infinitely more power than eith er the First or Second Banks of the United States ever had and mo re than the Aldrich Bill pro- posed, and it has abused such power shamefully and to the ir- reparable injury of the American people. Senator Glass may be entitled to credit for these pe rfecting amendmen ts though they bear the earmarks of the Rothschild s. It is he who has sponsored and piloted them through the United States Senate and through Congress. Upon the adoption of the bill President Wilson appointed Paul Warburg as deputy governor and a few months later as governor of the system. He held that position un til 1919 when he resigned and his assistant, W. P. G. Harding, was made gov- ernor. In the meantime William G. McAdoo had resigned his position as Secretary of the Treasury and David Houston, Sec- "},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"137 retary of Agriculture, had been appointed Secretary of the Treasury. In the meantime, als o, Barney Baruch had supplanted Edward M. House as President Wilson's confidential adviser. This was the set-up when the deflation of 1920 was decreed. It was a great shock to the bankers of the country when they found that they could not discount their \"eligible\" notes and bills at the Federal Reserve Banks. It had been proclaimed throughout the length and breadt h of the land that agricultural and com- mercial notes could, by the endo rsement and guaranty of member banks, be converted into currency ad libitum. The banks and the people were importuned by the treasury department and other government authorities to buy gove rnment bonds and to produce food in order to help win the wa r, and consequently the people had borrowed liberally and the ba nks had extended credit lib- erally, believing that the Federal Reserve System would extend credit if needed. Then without previous warning the Federal Reserve man- agement arbitrarily refused to extend credit to the member banks that served thp commercial and agricultural interests of the country. The Federal Reserv e authorities at first denied responsibility, claiming that the deflation was a natural reaction from high prices and wages, that it originated in Japan, etc. After the publication of the minut es of the secret conference of May 15, 1920, of the Federal Advisory Council, Federal Reserve Board and the Governors of the Federal Reserve Banks, they then admitted that the job was theirs and admitted also that it was a mistake. These minutes, which they th ought no one could ever dig up, set out in detail what they proposed to do, the manner of doing it and the reasons therefor. They said in substance that the \"vicious circle of increas ing prices and wages must be checked;\" that people were extr avagant and that this must be corrected; and strange as it may now sound they sa id also that people were not working hard enough and not producing enough g oods to meet the demands of the world! They proposed to correct all of these things by refusing to issue currency and extend credit . Of seventy bankers, who at- tended this conferen ce, only two voted ag ainst this unjust, illegal and destructive program, wh ich demonstrates, if demon- stration Is necessary, how unwise it is to invest an interested class, even as intelligent and ri ghteous as the bankers profess to "},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"138 be, with the sovereign power to fix and regulate values and the prosperity of the country. No doubt some of the bankers who voted for this program suffered grievously as a consequence of it. There followed one of the most destructive panics and de- pressions this country has even known. The borrowers who had extended their borrowings to meet the demands of their govern- ment, and the banks that extended credit most liberally for the same purpose, suffe red most. Many of them became bankrupt and many of them, both borrowers and lenders, died by suicide and despondency and disease as a result thereof. Even govern- ment bonds were depreciated to such an extent that the original owners lost them and the banks that took them under fore- closure lost money on them. The national wealth was estimated prior to this depression at from 500 to 600 billion, afte rward at from 250 to 300 billion. This meant a general reduction in values of from 200 to 300 billion dollars. This hu ge sum is more than the expenses of our National Government, including all of its wars, from its estab- lishment up to 1914. With such terrible consequences and with proven and ad- mitted responsibility for them it is difficult to believe that Con- gress would do nothing about it. But strange as it may seem no serious effort has ever been ma de to curtail the power that brought such disaster upon the country. On the other hand, it has been enlarged and amplified and legalized, as far as Con- gress can do so, by perfecting amendments;—always sponsored by Carter Glass. It was, of course, necessary for the Fe deral Reserve banks to loosen up in order to prevent a debacle, with the result that there was considerab le recovery in 192 7, 1928 and 1929, and with the result also that ther e was considerable speculation in 1929 in anticipation of still furthe r recovery. For the pretended purpose of checking this speculation the Federal Reserve man- agement again decreed deflatio n, which they brought about in 1930 in precisely the same manner as in 1920 , viz: by the con- traction of currency and credit. They made no \"bones\" about it this trip; it was done openly and above board and they have never denied it, Congress hav- ing condoned the crime once it was assumed it would do so again. And Congress not only c ondoned both crimes but it has "},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"139 legalized the methods employed; and not only that, it has granted an indefinate charter to the system and has given it additional power to deflate. The 1930 deflation was a repr oduction of 1920 with sub- stantially the same results. Our national wealth which had in- creased during the ten years intervening to about 400 billion dollars, was reduced 40 to 50 per cent. It bankrupted many men and many banks that had surviv ed the depression of 1920 and many younger men who were in the midst of establishing them- selves ; it transf erred the property of the debtor to the creditor; it operated with the greatest severity on the farmer and the laborer and their famili es; it reduced the va lue of farm products below the cost of production, in consequence of which many farmers lost their homes and means of living; it closed fac- tories, and thereby about twelve million laborer s lost their jobs and means of living and many of them lost their homes and became public charges. Both of these depressions were far more serious in their results than the short lived manipulated panic of 1907. The panic of 1907 was over almost as soon as the banks resumed their ordinary function of paying the checks of their depositors in currency. At that time it wa s beyond the control of the Elders to force a substantially lower le vel of values because our bank- ing system was then on a curre ncy basis and not wholly on a credit basis as it was in 1920 and in 1930 and is now. Organized ostensibly to supply an adequate volume of cur- rency and credit the Federal Rese rve System has been perverted into a vast money and credit hoarding machine; organized for the pretended purpose of preven ting panics and depressions, it has been employed to create the three most disastrous ones in the history of our country. Obviously, th e remedy for the panic of 1907 was for the gove rnment to put into circulation a greater volume of money and to outlaw as traitors the conspirators who brought it about. Obviously, the remedy was not to turn over to these pirates the sovereign function of issuing money, as the Federal Reserve Act did. The remedy for the catastrop hes of 1920 an d of 1930 was and is now to get more money in to circulation and to free the country from the control of this iniquitous Federal Reserve Sys- tem. Obviously it was not to extend the power and charter of the system; and obviously also, it was not the \"new deal.\" The "},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"140 remedies suggested are so clea r and simple, a nd those adopted are so inadequate and grotesqu e that even a congressman ought to be able to see and understand the sham and hypocrisy of it all. The methods employed in pu tting over the English Bank Act were almost identical with those used here in perpetrating the Federal Reserve Bank hoax. The British people did not understand that they were cont racting their cu rrency by de- monetizing silver, and that th eir government was forever ab- dicating its sovereign right to control currency and credit and values, any more than we understood these things. They, however, obtained two impo rtant advantages that we did not get: (1) They were paid for the charter and for every one of its eight renewals, whereas we gave the Elders the charter and then renewed it indefinitely and we did not recieve a \"thin dime\" for this valuable monop oly; (2) The Bank of England (and for that matter the central ba nks of issue of all other coun- tries) lends money direct at a low rate of interest to the people, whereas the Federal Reserve bank is authorized to lend only to member banks;—a \"banker's bank\" they call it, an d so it is— \"lock, stock, and barrel.\" "},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"141 XXIII. Deflation of 1937 '\"The principal factor of success in political is the secrecy of its undertakings; the word should not agree with the deed.\" —From Protocol 7. It should always be remembered that the Federal Reserve System was created for the avow ed purpose of supplying the country with an adequate volume of currency and credit. At the time of its consideration and adoption the commerce of the country was in the process of recovery from the panic of 1907. This panic was, as has been stat ed, a manipulated panic, precipi- tated by the central reserve banks of New York City, and pri- marily due to the fact that we did not have a sufficient volume of money in circulation; the sy stem was changed for the purpose of supplying such volume. There was universal demand fo r such change, led by the bankers of New York City. So eag er were they for a change of system that the elder J. P. Mo rgan and the elder Geo. F. Baker (president of the First Nationa l Bank of New York) testified before the Pujo Committee that there was a \"Money Trust\" and that it was in the public interest that it be cont rolled. This ad- mission was at the time a matte r of great surprise; the purpose of it is now better un derstood. In the light of subsequent events and of our present knowledge, we are justified in suspecting that the panic of 1907 was brough t about for the purpose of es- tablishing the system we now have. I prefer to believe in the inte grity and sincerity of Woodrow Wilson. I supported him for the presidency, in ignorance, how- ever, of the fact that his campa ign was financed by Jews. De- spite my bias, I must admit th at the Wilson Administration was responsible for the deflation of 1920. President Wilson appointed Paul Warburg, a member of the Rothschild banking firm, as de puty governor and later governor of the Federal Reserve System. Warburg was the real author of the act and was also author of the Aldrich bill. He openly ad- vocated a central bank, and publicly testified that the system could be transformed by admini stration into a central bank,— and he proceeded to so transfor m it. He proposed the amend- ment that gave the system the power of deflati on, which Presi- dent Wilson approved. Warbur g, however, resigned before the "},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"142 deflation process was begun and thereby escaped the odium of it. When the Federal Reserve Act was adopted the Democrats thought they had won a great vi ctory, but nevertheless many well informed Republicans claime d credit for the Act and that the bill was in fact the Aldrich Bill under a diffe rent name and in a different dress. The Democrats thought that the Federal Reserve Board was only a medium of contact between the twelve reserve banks and that the banks would be governed by their re- spective boards of directors and would function independently of it. It was originally provided that a member bank could at will convert its eligible notes into currency by simply endorsing them and sending them into the re serve bank of its district for discount; and the notes of the fa rmer and those given in the course of commerce were in the preferred class. This method of issuing currency was intended to supply the adequate volume of currency an d credit that the people of the country desired and were promis ed by the Democratic Party. It has all been changed since. The original purpose of the act has been entirely lost sight of and has been grossly perverted. Paul Warburg was right when he testified before the Senate Committee that the system coul d be transforme d into a good system (for the Elders) by admini stration. It has in fact been transformed adroitly by administration but more radically by legislation. Just prior to the panic of 1920 Congress adopted an amend- ment empowering the Federal Reserve Banks to limit the dis- count privileges of member ba nks and to refuse to discount eligible notes. This amendment changed the whole character of the system. It could no longer op erate automatically in response to the demands of the people. Thereafter currency could only be issued at the discretion of the Federal Reserve Banks,—which was subsequently ch anged to the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Banks prom ptly exercised this power and promptly brought on the panic of 1920 in pursuance of the resolution adopted at the confer ence between thei r representa- tives and the members of the Fe deral Reserve Board on May 15, 1920. The depressions of 1920 and of 1930, and the present de- pression would not have been possible except for this change in the act. Every step in the administration of the system and every act of Congress amending the law since its enactment, have been "},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"in the direction of a centraliz ed banking authority with the power of life and death over commerce and industry. Without authority of law the Federal Rese rve Board established an \"open market committee\" to fix and regulate the volume and value of money, with the Governor of the New York Federal Reserve Bank as chairman. It is and was the office of this committee to expand the currency by buying secu rities, etc., on the open mar- ket in New York and Chicago, and issuing in payment therefor the notes of the Federal Reserve banks. To contract the cur- rency the process is reversed; th ey sell securities and receive currency in payment therefor, wh ich is thereby withdrawn from circulation. This supplanted the original system of issuing currency in payment of eligible notes discounted by member banks. The difference is that under the pres ent system the \"open market\" committee determines how much currency is good for us; under the original system the demands of commerce and industry and the member banks determined the quantity of it; the one de- pends on the integrity and wisdom of the committee, the other responds automatically to the currency and credit needs of the people. The depression of 1930 and th e remedy for it was the issue in the 1932 campaig n. Mr. Roosevelt charged that President Hoover was responhible for the depression and that he had adopted inadequate measures to restore prosperity. There was no demand by either political part y or any candida te for office that the Federal Reserve System be converted into a centralized banking authority and that its powers be enlarged. No man could have been elect ed President of the United States on any such platform. Under the pretense of prot ecting bank deposits and of creating a corporation for that purpose, for which there was some demand,—the Cong ress enacted the b ill known as the \"Banking Act of 1935.\" This bi ll completed and perfected the system as a centralized banking authority with much greater power than was provided in the original Aldrich Bill. Among other things it legalized the \" open market committee\" and pro- vided that the members of the Federal Reserve Board and five members of the Federal Reserve banks (to be selected by their directors) should constitute this \"open market committee.\" The Bank Act of 1935 called for a new Governor, and new members of the Federal Reserve Board to be appointed by the"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"144 President,—and Mr. Roosevelt named Marriner S. Eccles as Chairman of the Board and appointed an entirely new board. All of them were new members with the exception of Professor Miller who had been a consistent and trustworthy deflationist from the beginning. The original Federal Reserve Act required the member banks to maintain reserves in the Federal Reserve Banks as fol- lows: country banks and those in smaller cities, 7% of the amount of their deposits; banks in reserve cities, 10% ; and in central reserve cities, 13%. These reserves were not subject to check ad libitum by the banks, as under the former system, but could only be checke d against ''under the regulations and sub- ject to the penaltie s, provided by the Fe deral Reserve Board.\" They were intended to be and were in fact, static and sterilized. To check against them meant th e suspension of the bank,—and its insolvency. They served no purpose except to sterilize and impound that much currency and cr edit, and the country did not suffer from them except to that extent. There was no need, or public demand for increasing them. The \"Banking Act of 1935\" auth orized the Federal Reserve Board \"in order to prevent injuri ous credit expansion or con- traction\" to double these reserve requirements. Obviously there could be no \"credit expansion\" by doubling the amou nt of steril- ized money and credit, and obviously it meant only to empower the Board to bring about credit contraction. Such delegation of power was wholly unnecessary b ecause the Board had absolute power to expand and contract th e volume of cu rrency through the operations of the \"open market committee,\" which involved the power to expand and contract credit, for credit is dependent wholly on the supply of currenc y to support it. Moreover the Board had fully demonstrated its power to \"prevent injurious expansion\" in th e catastrophes of 1920 and 1930. Evidently the purpose of this amendment was to provide a new method for bringing about deflation,—a different one from the old plan of refusing loans and advanc ing the discount rate. The old plan had come to be too thoroughly understood, and discredited by too frequent use. Since Mr. Roosevelt had been elected to correct the evils of th e Hoover administration, he could not bring about the same character of deflation in the same man- ner without the risk of having the whole \"Jew Deal\" upset by Congress; he must employ a differ ent method and a more subtle technique."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Federal Reserve Board did not permit this power to remain dormant very long. On August 26, 1936, they advanced these reserve requirements 50%, but the result was not satis- factory to them. On January 30 , 1937, they adopted the follow- ing resolution: \"Effective at the opening of business on March 1, 1937, the requirements as to reserves to be maintained by each member bank will be 75 per cent above the requirements pre- scribed by section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act, and effective at the opening of business May 1, 1937, the requirements as to reserves to be maintained by each member bank will be 100 per cent above the requirements pr escribed by section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act.\" That did the job, and the Roosevelt depression soon followed and is still on, and prosperity is not \"around the corner\" as the Elders and their sycophants tell you it is. There is now sterli- ized and hoarded in the \"reser ve accounts\" of the Federal Re- serve Banks the huge sum of $13,863,000,000. This is more than ten times the volume of mone y we have in circulation. It would furnish a sound basis fo r at least $70,000,000,000 of credit if this money was in circulation and in the vaults of the member banks. The depression would not have occurred if this money and credit had remained in ci rculation. It wa s withdrawn for the purpose of bringing on the depression. This order of the Federal Re serve Board operates with the greatest severity on the small an d weak banks. They, together with all other banks, have been forced by the Roosevelt Admin- istration to subscribe for governme nt bonds, with th e result that they are loaded down with U. S. bonds. The government has now taken from them a large per centage of their liquid capital, which has left many of them with insufficient resources to meet the ordinary demands of their cust omers, or to earn reasonable profits. There is no pr ecedent in other countries for such bank- ing practice and for such abuse of governmental authority. The \"Bank Act of 1935,\" inso far as it provided for guar- anteeing bank deposits, originated in the House and it was limited to that one subject. The amendments were added by Carter Glass when the bill reached the Senate. Glass was on the conference committee between the two bodies and succeeded in putting over these amendments and afterward boasted of the achievement in the press. This ever-faithful serv ant of the Elders is always on the job with his amendments when there is a banking or currency"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"146 measure before the Senate, for it is much easier to tack them on to some popular measure than to get them through independently upon their own merit or lack of merit. We may choose to believe in the good intentions of Mr. Roosevelt and to excuse him for this terrible crime, but we can- not close our eyes to the cold facts. The Federal Reserve Board is wholly of his selection and it has no doubt carried out his express orders. No official appointed by him will dare disobey him; should he do so he would be \"fired,\" for Mr. Roosevelt brooks no opposition. In one of his press conferen ces Mr. Roosevelt sought to excuse the order of the Fede ral Reserve Board on the ground that some unnamed prices were too high and out of \"alignment,\" but even if that be true, it is a silly excuse for bringing such great distress upon the innocent people of the country. The fact is, some prices always have been and always will be out of \"alignment\" due to supply and demand. There is this substantial diff erence between the Wilson 1920 deflation and the Roosevelt 1937 deflation: In 1920 prices and wages were high and money of course correspondingly cheap. We had $3 wheat, $2 corn, 40c cotton, $1.50 to $2 per hour wages, labor was fully employed and scarce. In 1937 we had been sufferin g from the Hoover deflation for more than five years; we had spent billions of dollars upon Mr. Roosevelt's recommendations for the pretended purpose of relieving it; there was no substantial relief; prices and wages were still low and labor unemployed; we still had approximately 10,000,000 unemploye d, and many millions on the dole. There was absolutely no excuse for the Roosevelt deflation. It was a deliberate effort on his part to wreck the country and to pre- pare the ground for revolution and dictatorship.

The ruler who is governed by the moral is not a skilled politician, and is therefore unstable on his throne. He who wishes to rule must have recourse both to cunning and to make-believe. Great national qualities, like frankness and honesty, are vices in politics, for they bring down rulers from their thrones more effectively and more certainly th an the most powerful enemy. Such qualities must be the attributes of the kingdoms of the goyim, but we must in no wise be guided by them.\"—From Protocol 1. President Roosevelt, in his in augural address on March 4th, 1933, said: \"Primarily this [the present depression] is because the rulers of exchange of mankind's goods have failed through their own stubborn- ness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failure, and have abdicated. Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men. \"True they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pat- tern of an outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money. Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to exhortation, pleading tearfully for restored con- fidence. They only know the rules of a generation of self-seekers. They have no vision, and when there is no vision the people perish. \"Yes, the money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit , . . and there must be prevision for an adequate but sound currency.\" Fine words, very, very fine, and very, very true. This was the program he deliberately promised the people of America in his inaugural address. This message states clearly conditions that then existed, and the cause and the remedy theref or. There was great rejoicing among the people; for the peopl e, while not understanding the money question, knew in a genera l way that their destressful situation was due to the corrupt management of our banking and currency system and here was promise of relief. If the Elders believed the Pres ident's sincerity there must have been \"weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth\" among "},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"them, for here was a man, whose election they had brought about, calling them selfish Shylocks and incompetents, and ac- cusing them of responsibility for the deplorable conditions he so graphically depicted, and threaten ing to destroy their control of the system which had caused so much wreck and ruin. On the day following the deliver y of this splendid speech the farm leaders, John N. Simpso n, et at., called on the Presi- dent and asked him to explain what he meant by the phrase \"There must be provision for an adequate but sound currency.\" The President said, according to press reports, that he meant that the government would exer cise its constitutional duty to issue money and control its value, that he would promptly cause enough money to be issued and put into circulat ion to restore wages and markets and values and prosperity to the country, and give a job to every man in th e land who wanted to work. One of two things is true: eith er the President did not mean a word of his speech and of hi s clarifying statement to the farmers, or else he changed his mind on the following day, viz., March 6th. We cannot know which is true. It is difficult to be- lieve that the President of the United States would make such statements with his fingers cr ossed and for the purpose of de- ceiving his friends and supporters; but it is equally inconceivable that he would change his mind upon this important subject, upon which he had deliberat ely spoken after ha ving evidently given it great thought, within the short space of twenty-four hours time. It is of course possible that Brother Baruch or some of the other Elders interviewed him shortly after the farmers and changed his purpose and his program, but it is not probable. His message turned out to be mere \"cunning and make-believe\" and it was no doubt intended as such. Whatever the truth may be, on the following day, March 6th, he issued a proclamation clos- ing all the banks of the United States,—state as well as na- tional, and good as well as bad. This was arbitr ary, high hand- ed, destructive, and illegal. Upon the point of its legality he says in his book, \"On Our Way,\" page four, that \"a friend of mine (p robably Frankfurter) suggested that some of the war emergency legislation of 1917 had not been repealed and found for me a statute of that year cover- ing the point.\" Even so, such statute could not be applicable to peace conditions, for Congress has no power to suspend the Con- "},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"149 stitution and laws of the land except as a military measure, and its power even then is lim ited to militar y necessity. Besides, there was then no necessity for the grant or the usurpation or the exercise of such power. The banks of the country were as a rule s ound and well managed. The trouble with them was that many of th eir customers had been bank- rupted by an illegal deflation or were near bankruptcy, and as a consequence their collateral had been impaired. It was the direct and intended consequence of the contraction of currency and credit by the Federal Reserve management in 1930. They suffered from the further trouble that there was not enough money in their vaults and in circulation to enable them to pay their depositors in currency. The only place that they could get the money was from the Federal Reserve banks, which had the exclusive power of issue, which it refused to exercise. The clear remedy therefore was not the closing of the banks and the utter destruc tion of many of them, but it was for the government to take over the Fede ral Reserve System or compel it to perform the service for wh ich it was organi zed, or for the government to exercise its const itutional power to issue and put into circulation a sufficient quantity of money. The obvious and quickest remedy was for the President to remove the Federal Reserve management and appoin t one that woul d discount the eligible paper of the member banks and issue them currency and thereby enable them to meet the currency demands and credit requirements of their customers. The obvious remedy was to reverse the deflation program of the Federal Reserve System and to bring about just and reason- able inflation through the expans ion of currency and credit. The President knew this to be the re medy and he promised to employ it, both in his inaugural message and in his statement to the farm representatives. If he had done so there would have been no occasion or excuse for his extravagant and unconstitutional reforms and his subsequent a ttack upon the Constitution itself. My own view is that Senator Long's estimate of the Presi- dent is correct, and that he did not mean a word of what he said in his message and to the farmer s. I think that he intended his so-called reforms from the beginn ing and that he needed a be- wildered and poverty stricken peop le in order to put them over. As Senator Long so graphically said, it was \"high cockalorum Roosevelt and low cockalorum Hoover,\" the difference between "},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"150 them being only the difference between \"tweedledum and twee- dledee.\" Mr. Roosevelt is only a \"skilled politician who has re- course to cunning and make-believe.\" In 1929 there were more than 30,000 state and national banks. The number had been reduced by deflation to 19,163 in 1932. As a result of this orde r 4,541 banks or approximately one-third of the remainder were permanently closed and their deposits aggregating $4,356,799,000 we re thereby frozen and a large percentage of them lost. (See Comptroller of the Currency Report of 1936, page 112.) The Pres ident thus ruth lessly des- troyed the property of the severa l thouand stockholders of the closed banks and of their several million depositors in flagrant violation of law and of our National Constitution, and later boasted of this achievement in his book \"On Our Way.\" The effect of this order was further deflation, and to make bad matters worse. It froze th e life savings of many thousand depositors and transf erred them from a stat e of comfort to one of poverty. They could have been saved, and the country could have been saved the expense of their main tenance, by the mere act of correcting the crime of 1930 in a legal way, viz., by revers- ing the process by which it had been perpetrate d. The worst of it is that the Presiden t then knew that this could be done and promised to do it. This does not tell the whol e story. The banks had already been reduced in number by the 1930 deflation (for which Presi- dent Hoover is justly held responsible) from 30,000 to 19,163. This further reduced the number to 15,806, or about half the number that existe d in 1929. The human imagination can scarcely conceive such ruthless and reckless destruction of men and of values and it cannot estimat e the injuries that the people sustained. It meant that the fo rtunes of approximately one-half of the thrifty men and women of the nation were either utterly destroyed or badly impaired;—and the other half did not escape without serious injury. On January 15, 1934, the Pr esident submitted a special message to Congress, as set ou t in his book \"On Our Way,\" in which he said: \"Permit me once more to stress two principles. Our na- tional currency must be maintained as a sound currency which, in so far as possible, will have a fairly constant standard of purchasing power and be adequate for the purposes of daily use and the establishment of credit."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"151 \"The other principle is the inherent right of government to issue currency and to be the sole custodian and owner of the base or reserve of precious metals underlying that cur- rency. With this goes the prerogative of government to deter- mine from time to time the extent and nature of the metallic reserve.\" John Stuart Mill or his disciple, David Ricardo, could not have stated the orthodox principl es of monetary science more clearly and forcefully. The Pres ident cannot plea d ignorance of the money question, for every message and speech that he has delivered on the subject shows that he understands it. There can be no restoration of values until there is a sufficient volume of money in circulation to suppor t them. That is as certain and as inevitable as the law of grav itation. If this volume of money rests upon the discretion of th e Federal Reserve Board then those values will be whatever th is Board chooses to make them, and they will be as stable as the mind of the Board is stable. Prior to the adoption of the Federal Reserve System the basis of our values rested upon th e volume of money in circula- tion, and they were st able because the supp ly of money, except for hoarding, was stable,—but it has been unstable and erratic since, because it rests wholly upon credit and upon the discretion of selfish and designing men. What has the President done to give effect to his brave promises? What has he done to wrest the control of our cur- rency system from the Shylocks, charged in his inaugural speech with controlling it, except to leave them in control and to perfect their control ? What has he done toward increasing our currency supply in order to restore employment and prosperity except to further reduce it? What has he do ne to restore the solvency of our country except to enormously increase debts and taxes?

"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"153 Please note the italicized figur es opposite the years 1914 and 1938. They give you the detail ed estimates of the Treasury Department of our stock of m oney for these years, and where it is located. You will observe that in 1914 all of the \"reporting banks,\" which means all of the banks of the country except the Federal Reserve banks,—had in their vaults $1,630,000,000; and that in 1938 they had $991,500,000. Thus it appears that the banks had $638,500,000 more m oney in their vaults when the Federal Reserve system was established, 24 years ago, than they now have. You will observe also under the la st column of figures that they estimate that there was in \"general circulation\" $1,829,- 400,000,—or $18.46 per capita in 1914; and $5,469,400,000 or $42.02 per capita in 1938. You will observe also that they do not count money in the Treasury, in the reporting banks or in the Federal Reserve banks as be ing in \"general circulation.\" This method of esti mating the money in \"general circula- tion\" is obviously true as to money in the Treasury and in the Federal Reserve banks, for these moneys are hoarded and are not subject to check. But it is obviously false as to the moneys in the \"reporting banks\" for these moneys are subject to check and they pass from the banks daily by check to the people, and are therefore in circulation. Where is all of this money th at they say is in \"general circulation\" and that they sa y is over and above the money that is in the Treasury and banks? There is only one place that it can be, to-wit: distributed among the people and in their \"tills and pockets.\" Any man of common sense knows that the people have not now an average of $42.02 in their pockets, and that they did not have an average of $18.46 in 1914. Any man of common sense knows that now, w ith business stagnant and prostrate, and with half of the people in poverty that they do not now possess more than double the amount of m oney that they had in 1914, when people ge nerally were prosperous. The Treasury Department explains this obviously false report by saying that there has been no \"corrected statement\" of the money in general circul ation since 1861 and that their estimate \"includes all United States paper money in other lands, all money worn beyond possibility of redemption, and all money lost.\" In other words, they count as money in circulation in the"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"154 United States all moneys issued since 1861, whether in circula- tion or not. But even this lame explanation does not explain the fact that the moneys in the po ckets of the people (according to the official report) have increased from $18.46 per capita in 1914 to $42.02 in 1 938,—whereas during the same period the moneys in the banks have decr eased from $16.30 per capita in 1914 to about $7.00 in 1938,—which is simply preposterous. Vast quantities of money have been lost or destroyed by fire, ship wreck, and otherwise, in the 80 years since a \"cor- rected statement\" was made; and vast quantities of it are now in foreign lands. The all-important question to you and me is: how much of it is now in the hands of the people of this coun- try? And that is a matter of suprem e importance to us for by all of the accepted authorities the qua ntity of money that circulates among the people, including the re porting banks determines all values and measures all values . Money is called the \"yardstick of values\"; the more money the higher values, and the less, the lower. We are entitled to know wh at that yardstick is, and to have a yardstick that will esta blish and maintain reasonable values. Who can say what it is today? One man's guess is as good as another's. The only estimate that has ever come under my observation was made some year s ago by a treasury expert by the name of McCoy who estimated it at $440,000,000, which at that time was about $4.00 pe r capita. It is probably less than that now, for the banks have less now than then, and con- ditions are much worse now than then, which indicate it. You can make your own guess . What would you say the people have in their pockets in your town? Let us take for example a town of 1, 000 population, with a bank and 20 business houses. It will be composed of about 300 men and women over 21 years of age, and 700 ch ildren under 21 years.

But the Treasury Department does not count as money in circulation the $5,000 in the vault of the bank; they only count as money in circulation that whic h is in the hand s of the people, and estimate it at $42.02 per capita. That estimate is not true and they know it. There is not a town or villa ge or city in this broad land of ours wher e the people have an average of $42.02 of money in their pockets,—not one. If their estimate is correct the figures given in the example above would be about fourteen times more.

Talk ab out \"buying power,\" the people would have it; of our surplus products and poverty and distress, there would be none. \"Oh,\" but they say, \"look at the $50,000,000,000 on deposit in the banks;\" the banks are just \"bulging with money.\" That is not money, and even the Treasu ry Department does not count it as such, it is only bank credit, which mu st be paid in money. The banks, according to their sworn statements, only have $991,500,000 of real money with which to pay this 50 billion dollars,—which means that if all of them were called upon at one time they could only pay about 2 per cent of their deposits. They are in a helpless and precarious position, and they do not dare to extend credit liberally; too many of them have been ruined by doing so. The moneys that measure valu es are bank notes and silver and gold and silver certificates,—p rimary money, as they call it. This primary money is our yardstick of va lue. We are entitled to know what this yard stick is. What is it? They have deceived Congress and the country with ly ing reports of it, to the very great injury of the people. Let us now have the truth, for \"truth is mighty and will make us whole.\""},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"156 This report is true as to the monies in the banks on the re- spective dates mentioned, for it is based on the sworn reports of all the banks of the United States, which are in turn based on an actual count of the money. In 1914 the people were prosperous and happy, and the dole and the C. C. C. camps were unknown,—and according to this official report the people then had in their pockets an av- erage of $18.49. Now eleven million of our people are out of jobs, and one-third of our po pulation (according to the Presi- dent) is poorly housed and clothed and fed, and yet they have in their pockets (as stated by this official report) an average of $42.02. I do not pretend to understa nd the trick or the system by which they count money in circula tion that is not in circulation, but I do know that the people ha ve not now and have never had an average of $42.02 per capita in their pockets. I assert that we now have in actu al circulation less th an $12 per capita, of which less than $4 is in the pockets of the people; and that there can never be any enduring prospe rity or any stab ility of credit and values until this basis is broadened by an adequate volume of money in circulation. This startling fact has been re peatedly called to the atten- tion of the President and many members of Congress, but the lying statements of the Treasury and Comptroller of the Cur- rency have been repeated from year to year since 1920 and ac- cepted as true by Congress an d the country. Prior to the crea- tion of the infamous Federal Reserve System true and reliable reports were made. Evidently it is the purpose of the manage- ment of the system to deceiv e Congress and the country, and it has done so to our great injury. They have recently taken a cen sus of everything we have, including mortgages,—except our money. A census of the vol- ume of money in circulation is the only information of any ma- terial importance to us; the other is all \"fol-de-rol.\" A census or an inventory could just as easily be taken of the money in the pockets of the pe ople, and would be of great value. It would show upon what an insecure and flimsy foundation all credit and values res t; it would blast the of t-repeated sophistry that there is plenty of money, that all we need is a little \"con- fidence;\" it would clearly reveal the absurdity of all the New Deal rot, for it would reveal th e cause of our distress and the "},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"157 remedy therefor; it would, it is to be hoped, cause Congress to take the necessary steps to put in circulation a sufficient volume of money, with adequate measures to keep it in circulation. If we had $42.02 per capita in actual circ ulation the prices of all products and wages—the price level—would be approxi- mately that of 1920; we would have no relief rolls and C. C. C. camps, and no curtailment of pr oduction; no need for regulation of hours and wages, and no excuse for the destruction of our National Constitution. Instead of being a money and credit ex- panding system to supply the ever-growing need of expanding population and commerce,—the Federal Reserve System is a vast currency and credit hoarding mach ine. With its true character and purpose clearly revealed, Co ngress gratuitously granted it an indefinite charter five years prior to the expiration of the original charter, and by the Bank Act of 1935 gave it carte blanche authority to regulate our welfare. There can be no stability of values that are dependent wholly upon credit, for there is no founda tion for such values other than the will of the credito r. When it is to his advantage to reduce them, thereby increasi ng the buying pow er of money, he will do so. It is always to his advantage to have cheap com- modities and dear money, and so it is normally that way. Let Congress exercise its constitutional duty and cause an adequate volume of money to be paid into circulation and kept in circula- tion, and values will adjust themselves to such volume and will be high or low in pr oportion to the volume , without the opera- tion of an \"open market co mmittee\" or any other committee. At the time Hoover left off with his de flation and Roose- velt took over the job, we had in circulat ion $730,435,000 of national bank notes. By 1936 we had none. All of them had been retired and cancelled by the compulsion of the Roosevelt Administration. (See Report of th e Comptroller of the Currency for 1936, page 112.) This meant a cancella tion of about $5.50 per capita, or about 50% of the sum of money we now have in circulation. It is but $257,265,000 le ss than all the banks of the country had in th eir vaults, of money of all kinds, on June 3, 1936.

Outside of the banks there is between $3 and $4 per capita in circulation and not $42.02 as they report it. It is utterly im- possible to have reasonable prices and wages and prosperity with such a limited volume. China has about $3 per capita, with the inevitable result that her mandar ins are exceedingly rich and her peasantry exceeding poor. That is the objective of the \"Elders\" here in our boasted \"land of the free.\" All of this lying and deception is in accordance with the \"law of our bank,\" viz: the protocols and the co de of the communists.

We now have $20,400,000,000 of gold and about $3,000,000,- 000 of silver stored in the Un ited States Treasu ry vaults in Kentucky and elsewhere. Is there any sane reason why all or the greater part of this money should not be paid into circulation? It would give us more than $150 per capita, restore values and prosperity to the country, and by so doing rend er useless and unnecessary the entire New Deal with its regimentation. We are like the miser who starves to death while fingering his money and counting it. It is beyond me to explain ho w it is possible for responsible treasury officials to make false re ports as to the volume of money in circulation from year to year and administration to adminis- tration, and how Congress could be deceived by them. But it is obvious that such reports are false, that they are made knowingly and designedly, and that the members of Congress and people generally have been deceived by th em. The worst of it is they will not believe the truth even when such falsity is proven beyond controversy. It demonstrates, if demonstratio n is necessary, "},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"159 the mighty Rothschild power in our government, whether it be a democratic or a republican administration. The Jews have written several text books on political econ- omy expounding what they call th e \"qualitative theory of money\" in which they assert that gold is the only sound money because of its intrinsic value- If this doctrine is sound we should and would be the most pr osperous people of the world because we have 80% of the gold of the world. Thirty years ago we had less than 10% and no dole, no unemp loyed, and reasonable prices and wages and taxes. It is another Jewish lie, and propagated for the purpose of deception and injury. In protocol 5 they say: \"The science of political economy invented by our learned elders has for long past been giving royal prestige to capital.\" And so it has. And it has given us the gold standard with its restricted volume of money and credit, and its attendant poverty and misery. But they claim too much when they say \"the science of political economy\" was invented by their \"learned elders.\" The true science of money was firs t discovered by Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill, both of whom were Gentiles. The false quali- tative theory was invented by the Jews because until recently they owned and controlled the greater part of the gold of the world and because the gold standard gave them the power to regulate the welfare and desti ny of the people of the world. According to both Smith and Mi ll all values are fixed and determined by the quantity of money in circulation without regard to its quality. It is the sole and only yard-stick of value. But the Jew economists dispute the truth of this fundamental law, and in support of their argu ment point to the large volume which they falsely say we have in circulation, bu t which is not in circulation.

Mismanaged Currency \"All people are chained down to heavy toil by poverty more firmly than ever they were chained by slavery and serf- dom; from these, one way and another, they might free them- selves, these could be settled with, but from want they will never get away.\"—From Protocol 3. We now have what is called a \"managed currency system,\" with the Rothschild power doing the managing. Make no mis- take about that. If it were possible for the people to do the man- aging the Rothschilds would not want that kind of system. We have had this system since th e amendment to the Federal Re- serve Act, which took away the right of the member banks to convert their \"eligible\" securities into currency, and invested the Federal Reserve Board with th e discretionary power to issue money. It is necessary to the success of this system that we have a limited quantity of money in circulation, otherwise they can't manage things; values will find their own level,—as they did prior to said amendment. With the exception of a few \"e lder\"-manipulated panics, we had a prosperous country up to the date of the establishment of this \"managed currency\"; we have had the three worst dis- asters in the history of our country, since. It was the manage- ment of our currency system that brought them all about, and that has brought about our present deplorable condition. The worst of it is, they were all brought about de signedly, including the present Roosevelt debacle. It is the Rothschild power that has controlled our finan- cial policy and consequently the welfare of the American people since the Civil War. We call it \"Wall Street\" but \"Wall Street\" is only the representa tive of the Rothschild power. The part of it that is not Jewish is strongly pro-Jewish. Even if that were not true, no financier has ever yet dared to oppose the mighty Rothschild power, and no states man has ever done so except Abraham Lincoln, and he was murdered. The \"Elders,\" with their press support, preach a \"managed currency,\" for that is what they want. Congress appears to be sold on it. The very capable an d persistent Se nator Thomas of Oklahoma had a bill calling for the creation of a \"monetary authority\" with directions to ma intain the price and wage level "},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"161 of 1929. Mr. Eccles, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, came out against it, arguing that it could not be done,—but it can be done, an d he knows it. It, however, will not be done by an authority that does not want to do it. Mr. Eccles does not want to do it because the Boss does not want it done; Eccles and his board brought the present disaster upon us because the Bo ss wanted it. The Boss has had this power for four years by virt ue of a former Thomas bill,— known as the Thomas amendment, and has not used it except to further deflate, despite the fa ct that he has repeatedly said that he wanted to restore and maintain the price level of 1929. We have had enough of manage d currency. If we had Jesus Christ to manage our money and establish our price level it might work satisfactorily,—but ne ver with a bunch of Jews in control of it. No man or set of men, Jew or Gentile, are wise enough or good enough to manage our welfare. If Congress will only repeal th e amendment establishing the managed currency system and th ereby restore the power to the member banks to discount thei r eligible paper without limit, the commerce and the people of the country will do all of the managing that is necessary. But a better plan still is to return to the system that pre- vailed before the esta blishment of the Federal Reserve banks. Let Congress resume its constitutional duty to issue money and regulate its value; an d let Congress cause to be issued and paid into general circulation $42.02 per capita or more. No man can justly complain of that,—not even the \"Elders,\" for they say it is now in circulation! I undertake to say that an av erage of $42.02 in the hand of the people will restore the price and wage level of 1920; that it will automatically do away with the A. A. A., the C. C. C, and all of the other new deal agencies; that it will restore general prosperity to the people of our country, and it may preserve our constitutional government and rescue as from threatened sov- ietism. The remedy for our present unfor tunate condition is so sim- ple and so plain, that I marvel th at our representa tives in Con- gress do not see it a nd adopt it. They must know that the de- flations of 1920 and 1930 and 1937 were all caused by the man- agement of the Federal Reserve system. The obvious remedy therefore is to destroy this system or curtail its power to de- stroy us. "},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"162 This system brought about th e three catastrophies men- tioned, by the contraction of currency and credit. The obvious remedy therefore is to reverse the process and to expand the currency, which will carry with it an expansion of credit. In- stead of adopting this remedy they have permitted the system to cancel and withdraw from circulation the greater part of our gold and silver certificates and national bank notes; they have sterilized and buried all of our gold, and much of our silver. The first step toward recovery and toward peace, prosperity and happiness is to discard our mismanaged currency system; the second is to determine the pric e and wage level and the volume of circulating medium that the people need in order to pay their debts and taxes and be prosperous; third is to pay such vol- ume into circulation, not in just New York and Chicago, but in such manner as it will reach the people throughout the length and breadth of the land; the fourth is to prohibit the banks and others from gatheri ng in this money and cancelling it or hoard- ing it; the fifth is to check up on it from time to time and to issue additional currency when required, to take the place of money lost or destroyed or hoar ded, and also to cover the in- crease in population and commerce. Sad to relate, Congress re-ena cted the Thomas Amendment, extending it until Ju ne 15, 1941. This bill in substance extends the 2 billion stabilization fund and the authority to purchase gold and silver ad libitum, and empowers the President to issue and pay into circulation 6 billion dollars of money which he re- fuses to do. In substance it tran sfers to the President the sole and exclusive power to \"coin money and regulate its value,\" which is the sole and exclusive constitutional duty of Congress. It was the original purpose of the author of the bill, Sena- tor Thomas, to get into circula tion such addition al volume of money as would restore prosperi ty to our stricken land,—as shown from his several speeches on the subject. But such has never been the purpose of the President, as shown from his administration of the measure. It was his pur- pose to prevent the issuance of such money by Congress, and the only sure way to do so was to get the power out of their hands and into his own. The Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry filed an instructive report* pointi ng out the true and only remedy. * Congressional Record, 75th Congress, p. 625."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"163 The following are the members of the committee: Messrs. Smith (chairman), Wheeler, Thomas of Oklahoma, McGill, Bankhead, Bulow, Mrs. Caraway, Pope, Hatch, Bilbo, Moore, Schweilen- bach, Gillette, Ellender, Norris, McNary, Capper, Frazier and Shipstead. The Commi ttee is composed of ten Democrats, seven Republicans and two Independen ts. It has among its members some of the ablest men of Cong ress, whose long records of serv- ice have proven them to be the true and reliab le friends and champions of the \"under-privileged\" and of the \"forgotten man.\" This report in substance says to the President of the United States:—Your farm relief bill and your other relief measures are all unnecessary; we have already invested you with the power to restore prosperity to the farmer and to all other classes of our people, and now it is up to you to do what we have authorized and instructed you to do. As to the devalua tion of gold the Com- mittee says: \"The first remedy applied was a monetary one—we went off gold and the dollar was devalued. In 2 months cotton went from 6.35 to 8.95 cents per pound, wheat from 45 to 75 cents, corn from 24 to 46 cents, and wool from 17 to 24 cents. Pre- cisely the same effects had been previously felt in other coun- tries leaving the gold standard, particularly in great agricul- tural producing countries like Australia, the Argentine, Can- ada, New Zealand, and Denmark. South Africa, the greatest gold producer in the world, went off gold because the pressure caused by staying on was too great for its agriculture.\" The further devaluation of gold will increase the export price of all commodities, for the reason that it increases the supply of gold and thereby cheap ens the medium of payment for our exports, but it wi ll only incidentally a ffect domestic prices. To the extent that ou r home market for ou r own product is con- trolled by the foreign market, it will increase the price of such commodity here, but it will not m ean a general increase of our prices and wages. In order to accomplish that end, money must be cheapened in our own country by getting more of it in circula- tion. The Committee calls th e President's attent ion to the fact, which he already knew, that th e Congress has already invested him with the power to increase prices and wages generally, and to restore employment and pros perity throughout the length and breadth of the land by \"(b) open the mints for the free coinage of silver; and (c) have issued additional treasury notes.\" The President has had this power fo r the past four years and he"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"164 has not used it. On the other ha nd he has employed every power granted him, with one single ex ception, to further deflate and to thereby carry out the policy which was initiated during the Hoover Administration. The exception is the power granted him to devaluate gold, which he only partially employed. The delegation of such power to the President by Congress was in violation of Section 1, Ar t. 8, of the National Constitu- tion, which imposes the duty upon Congress. The President sought this power, and Congress, relying upon his integrity and his good faith, granted it to him. It is evident that Congress would not have granted it except to be used, and it is also evi- dent that the President did not seek it for that puspose. It is also evident that he sought and obtained this delegation of power in order to \"head off\" Congress and to prevent Congress from relieving the country before he could \"put over\" his unconstitu- tional \"reforms.\" The Committee points out the true and only remedy, as fol- lows: \"The power over the value of the dollar, now divided among various agencies and departments, public and private, should he coordinated and concentrated in one Federal agency with a definite congressional mandate to such agency to prop erly adjust and regulate the va lue of the dollar and thereafter to stablilize it at su ch adjusted value.\" Note the language: — \"Congressional mandate to such agency to properly adjust and regulate the value of the dollar and thereafter to stabilize it at such adjusted value.\" That is precisely what the President has so often said in his messages and speeches that he wanted and intended to do. He has said repeatedly that he wanted to fi x and adjust it at the 1926 price level, and to stabilize it at that level. And that is also precisely what he has had the power to do for more than fo ur years, but has never yet done, nor taken an intelligent st ep in that direc- tion. The report of this committee is so convincing and compre- hensive that it deserves to be published in full, but since I am endeavoring to be brief I give space only to the high points of it. The Committee adopts in part the report of its predecessor on the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as follows: \"We report these facts and state that no substantial relief is possible for agriculture until the policy of deflation is not only checked but reversed and a substantial sum of actual money is admitted and, if need be, forced into circulation . . ."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"165 \"We report further that no just, substantial, reliable, or permanent relief can be provided agriculture or any other in- dustry until the money question is considered and adjusted.\" The Committee then on its own behalf says: \"Now a new question has arisen, as follows: How cheap should the dollars be made and how high should prices be raised in order to serve the best interests of our people? \"While the dollar was being cheapened and prices were going up, prosperity increased and all were happy. Since last March the dollar has increased in value from $1.13 to $1.19, causing prices to fall, unemploym ent to increase, depression to come again, and now business of all kinds has slowed down and a new depression is threatened. \"In 1926, during the era of so-called Coolidge prosperity, the dollar was valued in all commodities at 100 cents. In 1929, when the depression came upon the country, the value of the dollar had gone up to $1.05. Today, with much higher taxes and an almost doubled national debt, the dollar value is $1.19. \"The committee is of the opinion and reports that to date we have not cheapened the dollar sufficiently to raise the price level high enough to show sufficient profits upon which taxes are paid to balance the Budget. \"A high price level produces high commodity prices, high wages, high farm income, high national income, and conse- quently high tax income to the Treasury. A high price.level produces happiness, progress and prosperity. (As true as gospel.) \"A low price level produces exactly the reverse results. \"In 1919, with a high price level, we had incomes and values as follows: National income ............. _ _ _........................... _ ... $69,000,000,000 Value of farm property .............................. ___ 66, 000,000,000 Value of farm income ........................................ 13, 000,000,000 Value of exports ........... ___ ................... _ _....... 8, 200,000,000 Income to Treasury ............_ ..................... _ _ ..... 6, 007,000,000 \"In 1932, with a low price level, we had incomes and values as follows: National income .... ....... _._............................... $39,000,000,000 Value of farm property ......................... _....... 36, 000,000,000 Value of farm income ....... _.__..................... _._.... 5, 000,000,000 Value of exports _ ............. _ ..................__..._..... 1, 600,000,000 Income to Treasury ..............._.__......................___ 2,100,000,000 \"From the foregoing it is obvious that the price level has a controlling influence upon our domestic economy.

Indeed, I can find no explanation for it except in the Protocols. This does not imply that the me mbers of this committee or a majority of the members of Congress are the puppets of the Elders. On the other hand I believe in the integrity of Congress as a whole, and in the loyalty and patriotism of this committee. They accepted the President's farm bill as being the best that they could get at this time. There are many excuses for th e members of Congress that do not apply to the President. He and his Administration rep- resent the leadership of the Demo cratic Party. It is considered mutiny for the members of the party to re fuse to follow his leadership. The Republi can Party is now so poorly represented in Congress that it can scarcely be called an opposition party. Moreover, there is the mighty power of the Jewish-owned press to be considered. There is scarcely an editor or columnist who does no decry and ridicule inflation. Many of them do not know what it means, but they do know that their bosses are op- posed to it and that they are expected to voice the views of their pay-check. Our members of Congress live, year in and year out, in a political atmosphere created by this \"kept\" press. They are susceptible to its flattery and fear its ridicule. Let a congressman stand for th e interest of the masses of the people and he is a dangerous demagogue and an irrespon- sible radical. Let him stand fo r the program of the \"Elders\" and he is a great and wise st atesman and a profound economist. They have boosted Carter Glass so much that he himself has come to think that he is wise and virtuous and knows more about the money question than John Stuart Mill ever knew. The Elders have made the word \"inflation\" a by-word and a term of re- proach. No congressman will dare confess himself an inflation- ist. He may not want to be calle d a deflationist, and he may be willing to be termed a reflationist, but never an inflationist.

President Roosevelt has the power to create the \"high price level\"; he knows what to do, and how to do it,—but he refuses to act. He listens to Barney Baruch and his gang, th e bunch that financed his campaign, and not to the voice of the people who elected him and who are represented by their congressmen and senators. Barney Baruch's entire argument before the Senate Finance Committee was against infl ation; he piously said that if inflation was the only remedy he would favor it, but he knew that it was not, that we had plenty of money waiting for employ- ment and that all we need wa s \"confidence,\" and he proposed the \"new deal\" as being the tr ue remedy, outlining the program which the Roosevelt Administra tion has religiously followed up to this writing. Congress should either exercise its power to fix and reg- ulate the value of the dollar, or repeal the 10% tax on state bank notes so that the States may do so. If this tax should be repealed each State could issue its own state bank currency and thereby establish its own price level. This was the condition that existed prior to the war between the States.

If the language of the Presiden t in his message to Congress of January 15, 1934, has any meanin g at all, it means that the President clearly understands th at the Federal government can establish any level of value for money, goods, and service, that it desires, by the employment of its sovereign power to issue money. Every man who has any knowledge of money knows that this is true. It means also that he reco gnizes that it is the \"high prerogative\" of government to issue and co ntrol the vol- ume and value of money. It mean s also that he proposed to exercise this \"high prerogative\" and that he desired the neces- sary authority for that purpose. He has often expressed his purpose to restore the values of 1929, but has never yet taken an intelligent step in that direction. Congress enacted the legislation that he desired and rec- ommended. He has been in supr eme command for the past seven years. What has he done about it? Has the Federal Reserve System been overthrown or ta ken over by the government? No. It still operates at th e same old stand and in the same old way. Have the values of 1929 been restored and established upon the solid basis of an adequate vol ume of money? No, no, no; far from it. In pursuance of the President's message Congress enacted the Connally bill devaluing gold to the extent of 40 per cent, which in terms of dollars increa sed our stock of gold correspond- ingly. If this measure had been followed by the increase of cur- rency to the same extent, it would have depreciated the value of money and increased the value of goods and service correspond- ingly. In other words, it wo uld have increased wages and the "},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"169 value of all products and of all property approximately 40 per cent, and to about the 1929 level. But not one dollar of additio nal currency was put in cir- culation as a result of it. It did, however, increase the value of our export products that must be paid for in gold or its equiva- lent. Congress also passed the Thomas bill which authorized the President to purchase silver and gold, and which sought to re- monetize silver and thereby incr ease the volume of our circulat- i n g medium. The President was authorized by this act to pur- chase both gold and silver and to pay for the same with gold and silver certificates. We have bought the huge sum of $8,660,000,000 of gold at $35 an ounce within the past four years, principally from Great Britain and Russia. This gold was worth, prior to its devalua- tion, $20.67 an ounce. The premiu m that we have paid for it amounts to $3,500,000,000. The reason we are getting all of it is the fact that we are paying the highest price for it. We are also getting large quantities, sent here for safe keeping, by foreign banks and foreign Jews. The plan pursued is to sell U. S. bonds and thereby acquire the money to purchase the gold. This necessarily means that our good dollars are sent to Russia, Great Britain and other foreign countries in payment of their useless gold, and to that extent depletes our meager supp ly of dollars and their meager supply of gold. It should be remembered that this money although sent to foreign countri es, is counted by the Treasury Department as being in circula tion here and constitutes a part of our $42.02 per capita circulation. The worst of this operation is that it has saddled the Ameri- can people with a debt of $8,6 60,000,00 with an annual interest charge of about $200,000,000. If certificates had been issued against this gold as it was purchased and as was contemplated by Congress, the certificates and gold would offset each other, there would be no liability and no interest charge, and the gold would still be in circulation because the certificate holders could demand it. If certificates should now be issued against it we would have $8,660,000,000 of gold ag ainst which there would be $8,660,000,000 of bon ds and $8,660,00000 of certificates and we would be out the huge su m of $8,660,000,000 plus interest. Moreover if certificates had been issued against the gold as purchased there woul d be that much more money in circula- tion in the world, and world prices incl uding our own would be "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"170 higher, precisely to the same extent. As it is, the gold now lies dead and buried. It is of no earthly advantag e to us or to the people of the world. The people of the world are poorer to that extent and we are poorer to the same extent plus $8,660,000,000 of bonds; and world prices are lo wer to precisely the same ex- tent. Suppose we acquire substantially all of the gold of the world, as appears to be the plan of this regime. Whether it is the plan or not, it is su re to happen if we c ontinue to pay a 41 per cent premium. What then? Obviou sly we cannot sell our excess products because the people of the world wi ll have no money with which to buy them. Obviously we cannot sell our gold, for the same reason, and for the additio nal reason that most of the countries of the world already owe us debts that they cannot or will not pay. Gold must perforce be aba ndoned as a medium of inter- national exchange and some other medium adopted or else the people of the world must resort to the primitive cumbersome method of barter and exchange of goods. Germany has already been forced to do this very thing and she is doing it so success- fully that her people are prosperous. Secretary Hull complains that she has thereby knocked out his reciprocal trade agree- ments ;—a poor alibi is better than none. We have bought $1, 642,000,000 of silver, issuing silver cer- tificates therefor, which have gone into circulation in the coun- tries from which the silver wa s bought, including our own. This is in accord with the intent of Congress and of the law, and this is precisely what should have be en done in the purchase of gold. These silver certificates would have added to our circulating medium except for the fact that the Federal Reserve manage- ment withdrew and cancelled a corresponding volume of Federal Reserve notes. The net result of the operation of this law is to make a bad situation infini tely worse. We have got $8,660,000,000 of use- less gold and issued and sold $8,660,000,000 of bonds that must be paid by the toiling masses. We have $1,642,000,000 of silver certificates but no more money, since they have cancelled the same quantity of Federal Reserve notes. In fact, we have less, for they have sent vast quanti ties of our money to England and other countries in payment of gold and silver.* *See Congressional Record, 76th Congress, April 20 and 21 1939, Pages 6366-8 and 6421-5."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"171 This infamous stabilization- fund bill passed the House by a strict party vote; all of the Demo crats voting for it and all of the Republicans against it.

This means that the Rothschild power was behind the bill.

Besides this, there is or may be another $2,000,000,000 that Congress gave Morgenthau for the stabilization of foreign ex- change.

It was charged that he clandestinely loan ed the greater pa rt of the fund to England and France; and he very strenuously objected to an audit of it. If all this money was resurrected and brought to life through putting it in circulation by the payment of government bonds or otherwise, it would not only reduce the national debt about $20,000,000,000 but it would establish a home market for substantially all of our products, restore the full employment of labor, and restore values and the solvency of men and govern- ments, would automatically do aw ay with all of the plausible excuses for the New Deal and th ere would be no need for Mor- genthau's stabilization fund.

President Roosevelt and the Jew kept press and the Jew columnists are now whooping up a war scare. They have already stampeded Congress into aut horizing about $7,000,000,000 for armaments when we are now in le ss danger of invasion by a for- eign foe than in the past thirty years. Our most promising pros- pect is Japan, but she is busy in China and will be exhausted by the time she gets through with that job. Germany is not even a remote prospect, for she is no longer ruled by Jews. Germany, even if she conquers Britain, will like- ly create a United States of Europe, which they said was their objective. It will be less aggressive than a United States of Europe under Jewish control for the German people are an in- dustrious, home-loving, peaceful people, who acquire wealth by creating it, and not by manipula tion of currencies and mar- kets, as do the Jews. Germany has never acquired or sought to acquire a foot of soil in our country, as have bo th Britain and France. She could not be more of a bully as mistre ss of the seas than Great Britain has proven herself to be. "},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"173 Great Britain has, in flagrant violation of international law, declared a blockade of the entire world, from the Arctic Circle to Africa, to prevent the possibility of supp iles reaching Ger- many. She has announced that sh e would not even allow the shipment of food to the fami ne-stricken people of Europe. This is all manufactured wa r hysteria for the purposes of getting more money to be squandered, and of bankrupting our country and of cr eating a dictatorship of the proletariat and of continuing Franklin D. Roos evelt in office as our dictator. It is either for these purposes or for intervention in the present war. IT IS NOT FOR DEFENSE. Our national government and many of our city govern- ments are now bankrupt. They have reached their limit of tax- ation. Real estate has become more of a lia bility than an asset and much of it has been sold for taxes. The national govern- ment has levied a heavy income tax on undistributed profits which is stifling small industries, retarding the expansion of the large ones, and discouraging th e creation of new ones. And now they have made a flat increas e of the rate th at will crush many of the small industries. But few people care to invest in a new industry, assuming all the ri sk of loss if it is a failure, when the government will get most of the profits if it is a success. President Roosevelt stated the situation that prevailed at the time of his election, on page 62 of his book \"On Our Way,\" as follows: \"In talking with people about our basic economic troubles I have often drawn for them a picture showing two columns, one representing what the United States was worth in terms of dollars and the other representing what the United States owed in terms of dollars. The figure covered all property and all debts, public, corporate and individual. In 1929, the total of the assets in terms of dollars was much larger than the total of the debts. But, by the spring of 1933 while the total of the debts was still just as great, the total of the assets had shrunk to below that of the debts. \"Two courses were open: to cut down the debts through bankruptcies and foreclosures to such a point that they would be below property values; or else to increase property values until they were greater than the debts. Obviously, the latter course was the only legitimate method of putting the country back on its feet without destroying human values.\" That condition is infinitely worse today. There has been no increase of our prop erty values, but th ere has been a very"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"174 great increase in our debts and ta xes. Our situation is now more critical than ever before in th e history of our country. Our na- tional wealth is now estimated at about $250,000,000,000, which is too high, and our aggregate debts are es timated at about the same figure. We are insolvent and on the brink of a debacle. This is all in accord with the pr otocols and the code of the com- munists ; \"the law of our bank.\" The only remedy is the cancellation of all bonds and mort- gage debts. This can be done eith er by inflation or by law. The former is the method adopted by the Jews when they were in control of the German government, is the less painful, and there- fore the best. The protocol quoted above says in substance that \"debts are leeches\" but that we haven't sense enough to \"tear them off;\" that if we do not do so we will \"inevi tably perish by voluntary bloodlettin g.\" The latter statement is true, but let us hope that we do have sense enough to \"tear off the leeches\" before it is too late to save ourselves and our government. It is but just that these b onds and mortgage s should be cancelled. They are owned largel y by the Rothschild and other Jew institutions. They—the Roth schilds and their lackeys— have robbed us of our substa nce and exhausted our resources and forced us to borrow their money. The cancellation of debts is by no means a novel experiment. It was adopted by the rulers of Rome and Greece, and history records the fact that by reason th ereof the lives of both of these empires were prolonged. The Jews themselves had their \"jubi- lee\" year every fifty years, wh en they cancelled all mortgage debts and freed those of their own race who had themselves become bonded by debt."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"175 XXVIII. Poverty and Despair \"The aristocracy, which enjo yed by law the labour of the workers, was interested in seeing that the workers were well fed, healthy and strong. We are interested in just the opposite —in the diminution, the killing out of the Goyim. Our power is in the chronic shortness of food and physical weakness of the worker because by all that this implies he is made the slave of our will, and he will not find in his own authorities either strength or energy to set against our will. Hunger creates the right of capital to rule the worker more surely than it was given the aristocracy by the legal authority of kings. By want and the envy and hatred which it engenders we shall move the mobs and with their hands we shall wipe out all those who hinder us on our way.\"—From Protocol 3. In the administration of law we are conclusively presumed to intend the conseque nces of our acts. This standard applies to all of us, high and low, rich and poor, male and female, black and white; it is universal. We cannot commit murder or theft and be heard to say th at our intentions were good. If this stand- ard be applied to President Roosevelt—(and why should it not?)—we must conclude that the President has intended and still intends to bankrupt the government and people of the United States; to destroy local self-government and to create a Super-Government having sovere ign power over al l the activi- ties of the people, intra-st ate as well as inter-state. Why should the President do these wicked and terrible things to us, his trusting frie nds? Why such evil designs, and why does he pursue them so ruth lessly and so relentlessly ? Why, oh why, does he preach the ri ght remedy and adopt the wrong one? If the Protocols and the desi gns of the Elders are not the answer, then what is it? I can find but one answer, namely, the Protocols, and the program of the Elders who fi nanced his campaign and brought about his nomination for the pres idency. They want a dictator- ship and must have it in order to destroy our gove rnment and to establish their kingdom. A conten ted, happy people will not tol- erate war except as a defensive m easure, but a poverty stricken, discontented, restless people ar e ready for any change. Really, war, as destructive and horrible as it is, is not much worse than peace with deflation accompanied by its want and misery and degradation."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"176 If war should be declared then all of the President's reforms, including the regimentation of in dustry, agriculture, and labor, would be legal and defensible as war measures and there would then be no need for packing the Supreme Court. The President would then be our dictator or king, and in his glory. In his message to Congress, Jan. 3, 1940, the President said: \"You are well aware that Dict atorships have originated in almost every case in the necessity for drastic action to im- prove internal conditions where democratic action has failed to respond to modern demands.\" There are two routes to a di ctatorship: one is poverty and despair and the other is war. The war road led to the dicta- torship of Stalin and the very recent one of Winston Churchill; and the poverty route to the dictatorships of Hitler and Musso- lini. President Roosevelt has been pursuing both routes. He and the \"kept\" press have neglecte d no opportunities to create a war sentiment and at the same ti me he has been diligently and relentlessly paving the way for a dictatorship of the proleta- riat through poverty and distress . There may be some relief from it for a short period of tim e because of th e huge expendi- ture on government armaments but the underlying conditions remain and our escape will only be temporary. Sooner or later there will be a revolt of such pr oportions in the form of strikes or otherwise as will enable the Pr esident to declare an emergency and himself as dictator. The following is a comparative statement of the value of our money with that of othe r leading commercial nations: FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES (Value of foreign currencies in terms of dollars and cents) 1929 1940 England (pound) .................................. .$4.86 $3.15 France (franc) ............................................ 039 .17 3/4 Canada (dollar) ........................................... 99 .7880 Argentina (peso) .......................................... 95 . 2260 Mexico (peso) .............................................. 48 .1690 Japan (yen) ................................................... 46 . 2348 The 1929 column represents the comparative values when we had reasonably high prices and wages and a reasonable de- gree of prosperity. The 1940 colu mn represents the value when we have low prices and wa ges and 10,000,000 unemployed men. The explanation is simple. It will be observed that our"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"177 dollar is more than double the va lue of most foreign currencies. This necessarily means that the foreigner must pay $2 of his money to buy $1 of our products as measured by our money. It means also that he will buy from other countries that can sup- ply him with the same products whose mone y is near a parity with his own and where he will not be required to pay this premium. Conversely it means that the Jewish importers—and prac- tically all of them are Jews—can buy $2 of foreign goods with $1 of our money. It m eans also that the foreign manufacturer can manufacture his goods at a pproximately half the cost of ours because he pays for his ra w material, labor, taxes, etc., with cheaper money. It means al so that the importer can sell the imported article at a less price than it can be produced in this country. To illustrate further: With wheat at $1 per bushel a Cana- dian dollar would ha ve bought one bushel of our wheat in 1929, it will now buy slightly more than three-fourths of a bushel; two Mexican pesos would have b ought practically a bushel, it now requires six pesos; an Arge ntina peso would have bought a bushel, it now takes four; two Japanese yen would have then bought a bushel, it now takes four. The worst of it is that these two Japanese yen could in 1929 have bought a bushel of Argen- tine wheat, but now they can bu y four bushels, which means that they will buy Argentine wheat in pr eference to ours. Congress extended the life of the Hull reciprocal trade program by a strict party vote; a majority of the democrats voting for the extension and all th e republicans against it. This means that the American produc er cannot have the advantage of even his home market. It also necessarily means his bank- ruptcy and the unemployment of labor. These two New Deal policies taken together will drive th e final spikes in the coffiin of the American producer, whether farmer or manufacturer. They are fine things for the comparat ively few Jewish importers, but they will complete the ruin a nd destruction of the American farmer, industrialists and laborers. They pave the way for the dictatorship of the proletariat, and they were intended for that purpose. The following lines fr om an unknown author describe present conditions: \"Mr. Roosevelt is my shepherd And I am in want;"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"178 He maketh me to lie down on park benches, He leadeth me beside still factories, He disturbeth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of destitution for his party's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of the depression X anticipate no recovery, for he is with me; His policies, his diplomacies, they frighten me; He prepareth a reduction in my income, And in the presence of mine enemies He anointeth my small income with taxes. My expenses runneth over,— Surely, unemployment, want, and poverty shall follow me all the days of my life And I shall dwell in a mortgaged home forever.\" It is likely that the reciprocal trade agreements will not prove to be as injuri ous as they were intended to be. Der Fueh- rer has cancelled by conquest th e agreements negotiated with France, Belgium, Poland, Czecho Slovakia, Holland, and Lux- embourg. No matter what the outcome may be the ominous fact is that we now have, an d will in the future have, a very limited market for our surplus products, for three reasons: (1) We have alienated most of the countr ies of Europe and Asia by boy- cotts and threats of war; (2) they have no gold or American dollars with which to pay; (3) they will be forced to adopt and will adopt a different currency system that will render our hoarded gold useless. Dorothy Thompson stated in one of her syndicated articles that Hitler plans to establish the \"United States of Europe,\" to destroy tariff barriers and to create an independent currency system. It is the logical result of our ownership of 80% of the gold of the world. There are also two kinds of dict atorships: the one of the Gen- tile called \"fascist,\" such as the dictatorships of Italy and Ger- many which were brought about to preserve law and order and the rights of property, and as a protection against the usurpa- tion of the commune. The other, the dictatorship of the Jew, called \"communism,\" such as that of Russia, and more recently of England. The latter is a dest ructive type of dictatorship,— destructive of law, religion, an d freedom, and accompanied by all forms of lawlessness and murder; the latter is Semitic, the former is an ti-Semitic. The excuse for Churchill's di ctatorship was the Norway disaster, but it was only an excuse, for Churchill himself was"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"179 responsible for the disaster a nd not Chamberlain. The Churchill appointment precipitated the attack on Holland and Belgium which may result in the destruc tion of the British Empire, but Churchill will continue as dictator despite the disaster, so long as the Jews can keep him there. He has faithfully followed the program of Stalin. Hi s first act was to imprison all anti-Semit- ics, classing them as \"Fifth Co lumnists,\" and now he has provid- ed for the death penalty for them. The last report we have is that they are secretly tr ying Sir Oswald Mosely, which means that he will be convicted and condemned to death, other- wise there would be no occasion for secrecy. Under the pretense of meeting a grave emergency, viz: a threatened invasion by Germany, President Roosevelt sent a message to congress asking that the bond limit be increased and that additional taxes be impos ed. Congressman Andrew Ander- son of Minnesota naively observed that this is the sixty-third emergency that has confronted this administration. The President told Congress in substance to enact this legis- lation and turn the money over to him to spend and then adjourn and go home; that they couldn't do anything but talk and that they might be in his way. A subservient Congress has already in- creased the income tax a flat 10 %, and provided for a large in- crease of the ta x rate of the little taxpay er, and a small increase of the big one, and they have voted to increase the bond limit from 45 to 49 billion dollars. Bu t the republicans have led a revolt against adjournment and it has been postponed for a time at least. Germany financed the building of the greatest mechanized war machine in the history of the world without gold and with- out bonds. With 80% of the gold in the world and the greatest resources of any country, Mr. Roosevelt must have $4,000,000,- 000 of bonds and an approximate 40% increase in income taxes in order to even make a start. What the bonds and taxes will be by the time he is through no man can foresee. He has not yet even made a suggestion to lighten the tax burden by cheap- ening the dollar. He is not likely to do so for the simple reason that such act would au tomatically abolish his W. P. A. and other hand-outs, jeopardize his campai gn fund and his dictatorship prospects. The Wilson administration financed the last war, plus the gifts to the Allies of about $1 5,000,000,000, with bonds. This"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"180 was wholly unnecessary and a colossal crime against the Ameri- can people but we can give that Administrati on credit for a lit- tle breathing spell of about eight een months of cheap money. Mr, Roosevelt does not propose to give us any respite whatever. His evident purpose is to hold our \"feet to the fire\" until we are ready to concede him all the power he covets. As desperate as our financial si tuation is now, this Admin- istration can finance the whole armament program by simply cheapening the dollar. Mr. Roosev elt knows that this is true, and many members of Congress know it is true. We can pay the bonded indebtedness of $45,000,000,000 plus $10,000,000,- 000 for armaments with gold certif icates having a 40 % gold re- serve, which according to all of the orthodox authorities is more than sufficient. Such act would afford instant and complete re- lief to all of the impoverished people of this stricken land, for it would cheapen money to the exte nt that they could pay their debts and taxes. All of the pending bills will place the burden on the poor who do not want war but who must do the fighting. The cheap- ening of money would put it on the rich, many of whom want war and will profit by it, and few of whom will do any fight- ing. Unfortunately, the richest of them will escape taxes in any event through their ownership of government tax-exempt bonds and their stock-selling devices. And now the Presiden t proposes that the R. F. C. be au- thorized to lend the South American countr ies $500,000,000 against the products of their farms and ranches in order to im- pound them and to keep them from being sold to Germany. This is just a starter; it is only a white chip. It will require many times that amount and then the scheme will be a failure. The people of the several co untries of South America will not sell us their products unless it is to their advantage to do so. That is a cinch. Germany can and will pay more for them than we can afford to pay. That is also a cinch. It is true we have more gold than Germany, but Ge rmany can manufacturer goods cheaper than we can. That is anot her cinch. In the last analysis international trade is an excha nge of goods. Gold is only the medium of effecting such exchange. Germany has no bonded indebtedness and we are mort- gaged up to the limit \"and then some.\" Ou r national, state and city governments and our railroads, farms and industries are "},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"181 heavily mortgaged and these mortgages must be paid in interest and taxes. About one-half of our cost of production is composed of interest and taxes. We can't compete with the producers of a country that is free of such burden. We must cancel our debts or we perish. We must free the people from the slavery of debt. There is no other way. "},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"182 XXIX. America Enters the War \"In a word, to sum up our system of keeping the govern- ment of the goyim in Europe in check, we shall show our strength to one of them by terrorist attempts and to all, if we allow the possibility of a general rising against us, we shall respond with the guns of America or China or Japan.\" —From Protocol 7. The President has at last inve igled us into war. Without authority from Congress and with Congress in session, he au- thorized the War Department to transfer vast quantities of our arms, munitions, and war equipmen t to private corporations for the express purpose of being re-sold by them to the Allies, and thereby evading the law. This was done in order to avoid the agreements of the Hague conven tion of 1907 an d the United States Neutrality Act of 1918 wh ich made it illegal for a nation not at war \"to furnish any bellig erent with troops, ships, muni- tions of war, money, or with co mmodities of direct or indirect use in war.\" These laws apply to nations and not to individuals, and hence this miserable subterfuge. A few days later, to-wit: on J une 10, 1940, President Roose- velt said in a speech at Charlottesville, Va., \"We will extend to the opponents of force (the Allies ) the material resources of this nation.\" He thus boldly proclaimed that he would do openly what he first sought to do by indirection and subterfuge. In flagrant disregard of internati onal law and of our own solemn treaty and of our own neutrality law, he pledged without limit the resources of this nation to the Allies. This includes arms, munitions, money, ships, food and supplies of every kind and character that may be required. It means that he has on behalf of our nation, assumed the burden of supporting the war of England when we ourselves are on the verge of bankruptcy, if not bankrupt. In its ultimate consequences it means much more than that. General Hugh S. Johnson said of the first clandestine transfer of our war supplies: \"This is no action short of war. It is war. In defiance of Congress and of the constitution the President by a slick trick . . . has committed us to war.\" And now he has the cold nerve to boastfully proclaim it to the world. The next step will be to send our ships with munitions and supplies and convoys to the Allies; and the next will be our soldiers; and then "},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"183 as surely as night foll ows the day, the next will be the destruc- tion of our government, the loss of our liberties, and a dicta- torship. A few days later Roosevelt said in response to an appeal from Premier Reynaud for more help, that he was \"doing every- thing he could for them and that he would continue to do so as long as they would hold out; bu t that Congress alone had au- thority to declare war.\" This pr omise plainly encouraged them to fight to the bitter end, and to ld them that they can depend on him for everything in his power , except a declaration of war, for the reason that he was without that authority. Mr. Churchill explaine d this appeal to the House of Com- mons in a speech a few days late r. He said that when Reynaud informed him that it would be necessary for France to surren- der, he avdised Reynaud to appeal to President Roosevelt to now enter the war. What right had ei ther of them to assume that Roosevelt would declare war on their request? Reynaud did ap- peal and when Roosevelt said he could do no more at this time but advised him to continue th e fight,—then it was that France surrendered. Paul Reynaud a nd his backer, Georges Mandel (Jeroboam Rothschild) then fled the country to escape the wrath of an outraged and deeply injured people. Now Britain is facing certain defeat with great destruc- tion of life and property. Chur chill, Duff-Cooper and Anthony Eden have repeatedly spoken to the English people over the radio in order to allay their fears and resentment. They have promised them that America would soon ac tively join them and have en- couraged them to fight until this help arrives. Why all of this reliance on Am erica if there has been no promise of help? It all goes back to the peaceful settlement at Munich when Rooseve lt led the chorus of \"never another Mu- nich.\" It goes back to the pl edges of Bullitt and Kennedy to Poland, France, and England. The radio commentator, Edwin C. Hill, stated that Roose- velt actually conferred with a few of his friends about himself declaring war, with Congress in session! They no doubt ad- vised against it, and wisely so. \"Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed, That he is grown so great?\" Congress is now at last eviden tly afraid of him, for after"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"184 having tentatively agreed to ad journ on June 22n d the decision was revoked. We are now at war with Germ any and Italy. This war may be extended later to Japan and Spain.

We now have in prospect the universal war for which the \"Learned Elders of Zion\" have been scheming and wo rking since they failed to es- tablish their Super-Government through the League of Nations. It may result in the kingdom of the \"Despot of the blood of Zion\" with Roosevelt or Jeroboam Rothschild as such \"King- Despot.\" The President has already practically assumed the office of dictator, with only an occasional protest from Congress. He has led us into war, with Congress in session, and despite the recent assurances of the majori ty of the members of Congress that under no circumstances woul d they permit ou r country to become involved in the present war except for defense upon our own shores. It was recently reported in the pr ess that a contract had been made with the Ford Motor Company to manufacture airplane engines for the British Empire and America. Mr. Henry Ford denied the report. He said th at his company was willing to make these engines for the defense of America but not for the prosecution of the war by the British. Mr. Knudsen, on behalf of the \"Council for National Defense,\" answered that the con- tract involved making engines fo r both governments, and the Committee cancelled the contract because of Mr. Ford's refusal to manufacture engines for the British Empire. This controversy reveals the following facts: (1) That our alleged \"Council for National Defe nse\" is now engaged in buy- ing war equipment for the British Government; (2) that they are more interested in buying fo r the British Government than for ourselves; (3) that they ar e making these purchases for the joint account of the United States and the British Governments; (4) it is a fair inference from th ese facts, that this Committee will make payment for this equipment out of the $5,000,000,000 fund that Congress has provided for that pu rpose. Thus it ap- pears that we are being taxed to the point of confiscation of property, to support the tottering Bri tish Empire and the Roths- child family fortune. "},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"185 We are in. Make no mistake ab out that. And we will stay in until our government is destroyed, if Franklin D. Roosevelt is continued in office. And we are not in for the defense of our country; we are in for its destruction. It is now reasonably clear th at England will soon be taken by the Germans,—but that may not end the war. It would end it except for our intervention. It was Churchill himself who said that we did the Allies more harm than good in the last war, because by entering it we delayed the peace for two years. He criticized us for then doing what he now begs us to do. Our entering the war would now do the people of the British Empire more harm than good, for many of them and their possessions will be destroyed if the war is prolonged. The Senate Naval Affairs Committee, of which Senator David Walsh of Massachusetts is chairman, investigated the rumor that our government ha d transferred 23 of our war vessels to Great Britain. Mr. Lewis Compton, acting Secretary of the Navy, at first denied that such transfer had been made, but later admitted it; he admitted also that the vessels were not obsolete, and his own responsibility. When the President was advised of this, he contradicted Mr. Comp ton and informed the committee that he alone was responsible for the transfer. This was probably done in order to prevent furt her investigation and to save further disclosures. This transfer is in plain viol ation of Chap. 30 Title V 3, 40 Stat. 222, U. S. C. A., which pr ohibits the transfer of a war vessel to a belliger ent nation. The Presiden t again violated the law by giving Britain 50 of our de stroyers with their guns and ammunition and that cost us more than $100,000,000.00,—as proposed by \"Sir\" John Pershing- This was a pretended ex- change for air bases, at first denied but later justified on the ground that it was a good trade. The cons ideration paid for these 99-year leases of a few thousand acres of cheap land is o grossly exorbitant that it can only be considered a gift and an under-cover entry into the wa r. This was done by our dictator without the consent of Congress, and with Congress in session. It is either a flagrant violation of our own law, punish- able by fine and imprisonment, or it is war. If we are in fact engaged in war with Germany and Italy it is legal and defensible, otherwise it is not. It is evidently intended by the President as an under-cover, back-doo r entry into the war. "},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"186 Mr. Churchill recently stated in a speech in the House of Commons that in case Hitler invaded and conq uered England that the governme nt would move to Canada and with our help they would continue the fight. In anticipation of such contin- gency the President made a trip to Canada a few years ago and there made a speech in which he assured the Canadians that the United States would extend the M onroe Doctrine to Canada and would protect them. This was an unprecedented a nd unwarranted and unauthor- ized extension of the Monroe Do ctrine. It was never intended to apply to any part of the British Empire, but only to the weak and defenseless countries of South America. It was to prevent future foreign absorption of South America. When this doc- trine was first announced Canada was a part of the British Em- pire and was accepted as such. It is obvious that this assurance on the part of the Presi- dent was a premeditated one, in pursuance of a carefully pre- meditated plan, and in anticipation of the war that the \"Elders\" then planned and that we now ha ve. They \"planned it that way.\" They have been preparing the ground for this war for many years. It is evident that Mr. Ro osevelt has participated in this conspiracy. That is the explanation of the New Deal with all of its regimentation, the purchase of the gold and silver of the world, the stabilization fund, the extension of the Monroe Doc- trine, and of his frantic desi re to get us into the war. If Mr. Hitler is the blood-thirst y, ambitious villain that the Jew press represent him to be, he will declare war on us and he will do it now while we are unprepared and unarmed. He will not wait two or thre e years until we can gear up our indus- tries and replenish ou r depleted war equipment. He has more sense than that; he will do it now while he is re ady and we are not. The Mexican government is a vacillating unreliable one that is sometimes friendly to us and sometimes not, accord- ing to their interest of the moment; the same is true of Brazil. Offered sufficient inducement, either of them will turn against us. President Vargas re cently made a speech in which he in substance welcomed the new order that would accompany German victory and would supplant the decaying civilization of Britain and France, as he described them. He may be right about it, for they both have the \"Jew-rot,\""},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"187 which is a combination of graft, bribery, and of great wealth and great poverty. Their inefficiency in war is due primarily to this disease. We suffer from the same cancerous disease gnawing at our vitals, and we will suffer the same fate if we do not eradi- cate the germs of it. It is at least a possibility th at Brazil will welcome Hitler. In that case, what will become of the steel plant we propose, according to press reports, to build in that country? (Osten- sibly, of course, as a defensiv e measure.) There is now pending in Congress a bill with administration support, to enlarge the powers of the R. F. C. in order to enable it to furnish the re- quired capital. There appears to be no constitutional limitation whatever upon the activities of this vicious administration of our government and of th is vicious corporation. It is at least debatable whethe r we are justified in going to war to enforce the Monroe Doctrine, and particularly to pro- tect a state that does not ask or want our protection. If it is our fixed policy to enforce this do ctrine then we should ourselves respect it. The Monroe Doctrine demands America for Americans.— but concedes Europe for European s, and Asia for Asiatics. That is the present position of Japan and Germany and Italy. Japan proposes to enforce it in Asia; Hitler and Mussolini in Europe. However much we may wish to pr eserve the status quo in the East Indies and the Br itish Empire, it is none of our affair, and there is nothing we can do about it except to go to war and prob- ably destroy ourselves. The people of these countrie s can solve their own problems in their own way, as they have heretofore done,—without our help. Our position should conti nue to be—as it has always been into maintain friendly rela tions with whatever governments they establish. It must be conceded that both Hitler and Mussolini have ample provocation for war. The President has called them names and made faces at them. He said of Mussolini that he was an assassin who \"stabbed his neighbor in the back,\"—but if he had declared hi mself on the si de of the Allies he would have had the benedictions of the President.

If we should make the mistake of re- electing Roosevelt for a third term , he may construe this as a ratification of Roosevelt's war-like demonstrations and he may conclude that war is in evitable sooner or later. In that case he may accept Mr. Roosevelt's challe nge and wage it while we are unprepared. No matter what opinion we ma y have of Mr. Hitler, we must concede that he has been forced into this war; that he was ready to make peace on the basi s of restoring to Germany the territory wrongfully taken from her by the peace treaty; and that he has conducted the war according to the rules of civilized warfare.

They have now been overthrown in all of the countries of Eur- ope except England, th eir ancient stronghold.

Why have we entered this destructive war upon the losing side? War involves grea t sacrifice and suffering. It is never justified except for self-defense. The warmon- gers seek to justify it upon that ground. They tell us that the British navy is our first line of defense. It has never been so used, and neither we nor Great Br itain have so regarded it here- tofore. But even if that were true it would be far cheaper and more dependable for us to prov ide our own navy. That is pre- cisely what the government is now proposing to do and for which it has authorized immense appropriations. If our own country is in danger of attack the place to defend it is in our own waters and on our own shores and not in foreign waters and on foreign shores. On June 10, 194,0, there was published in all the leading newspapers of the country a fu ll page advertisement over the signatures of about thirty well known Amer icans, headed by William Allen White of Emporia, Kansas, with the flaring head- line, \"Stop Hitler No w.\" It was followed by an argument ad- vocating our immediate entry into the war. According the press reports, Mr. Rooseve lt read the advertis ement \"and found it to be a great piece of work a nd extremely educational for the people of the country.\" Yes, a \"gr eat piece of work and extreme- ly educational\" for war. This advertisement was paid for by the Rothschild banks of Morgan & Co., Kuhn, Loeb & Co-, and their affiliates.* There are very obvious reason s why \"our bank\" would like to get America into war. Until recently the argument was made that we should enter the war on behalf of France becau se she helped us in our war for independence against Great Britain. This was also one of the arguments for our entering World War I, which resulted so disastrously for the entire world. This argument, however, * Congressional Record, July 11, 1940, p. 14359-14360."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"190 no longer obtains, since Englan d is now at war with France. False Albion treache rously turned upon her former ally, France, and destroyed many of he r ships and kill ed more than 1200 of her seamen. The battle, if it may be so dignified, is thus described by the magazine \"Time\" : \"In the night of July 2-3 (1940) at various ports of England and Scotland, armed parties of British officers and men quietly boarded all major French ships berthed with the home fleet, mostly at Portsmouth and Plymouth.\" They were not able to do this at Oran, which is in French waters, and so they slipped up in the night and mined the waters around the French ships while they were riding peacefully and unsuspectingly at anchor. Th e British commander then de- manded their surrender and upon being refused opened up a murderous fire without warnin g that destroyed and damaged a number of French ships and killed 1200 men. The British sustained no losses for the reason that the French did not ex- pect an attack by their former al ly, their ships were not steamed up and consequently they were in no position to maneuver their guns and to fight. This was another great Britis h victory (?) and so hailed by the Jew press of England and America. It was another Alt- mark victory. The only two British victories in this war to date have been against an unarmed foe and in vi olation of the rules of civilized warfare. No savage would have attacked a pros- trate friend without provocation. French Foreign Minist er Baudouin said of it: \"Mr. Church- ill is guilty of an ac t of aggression, which is without precedent in the history of the world;\" that Britain \"must shoulder the blame for the loss of the war fo r she selfishly thought of the defense of the British Isles a nd provided only a minimum mili- tary aid to France.\" He later st ated that France had furnished three million men and Britain only two hundred thousand. Baudouin said further that \"the British saved four-fifths of their troops from Flanders, em barking them from Dunkerque, while the French lost half of th eir forces; that the British fur- nished only 14,000 troops for rear guard operation and the rest of the 200,000 were French.\" He might have added that the French lost 1,900,000 me n in killed, injured and prisoners, which is nine times the number of so ldiers furnished by Britain, and more than forty time s British casualties.

A little while ago it was said we owed it to France and to LaFayette to help her. And now she is our en- emy? Why? Can it be because the French government refused to allow the city of Paris to be destroyed in order to get us into the war? Can it be because Fr ance surrendered after the loss of two-thirds of her army? N o, no. These are not the reasons. Whatever the true reason may be we have not entered this war to help France. We do not yet know the whole tr uth about all of this war propaganda and the President's activities to involve us in the war, but some of it has come to light. When Germany captured Warsaw, the capital of Poland, she also captured the official ar- chives, and among them a transcript of the negotiations be- tween our government and the Po lish government leading up to the war. It appears therefrom that our ambassador to France, the Jew Bullitt,—just before sailing for Paris \"w ith a whole trunk- full of instruments and conversati ons and directions from Presi- dent Roosevelt and the State De partment and senators who be- longed to the Committee on Foreign Affairs,\"—held a confer- ence with the Polish Ambassador (to the U. S.) Count Potoki. This conference was reported by Count Potoki to his govern- ment in part as follows: \"3. It is the decided opinion of the President that France and Britain must put an end to any sort of compromise with the totalitarian countries. They must not let themselves in for any discussions aiming at any kind of territorial changes. \"4. They have the moral assurance that the United States will leave the policy of isolation and be prepared to intervene actively on the side of Britain and France in case of war. America is ready to place its whole wealth of money and raw materials at their disposal.\"* It appears further fr om these official notes that the Presi- dent was quite urgent that Pola nd should reject Germany's de- mand for return of the Danzig Corridor and that Britain and France should support Poland in this position and should de- clare war on Germany if she (Germany) undertook to take it *Congressional Eecord, July 11, 1940, p. 14371."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"192 by force. Beck refused to keep his engagement with Hitler. This was followed by Hitler's invasion of Poland and a declaration of war on the part of Britain and France against Germany, as pointed out in a previous chapter. Thus it appears that President Roosevelt is himself pri- marily responsible for the wa r. We can now understand why Reynaud on Churchill's advice, i ssued his distress call to Roose- velt to come in. We can see why the Presiden t said in substance in reply: fight on to the end, I am doing everything I can. This explains also the speeches that are being made from time to time by Churchill, Duff- Cooper and Eden, encouraging the people of England to conti nue the fight on the ground that the United States will later enter the war. It explains their oft- repeated published statement that this is our war and that they are fighting it for us. It is not our war. It is the wa r of our Jews, of French Jews, and British Jews. The French Je ws have been overthrown and have fled the country. The Britis h Jews are still in power, and so are ours. It is a war to save the Jew empire and the gold standard and to destroy our government and to enslave us. It is a war to establish the \"Kin g despot of the blood of Zion.\" England can make peace now wi thout the immense destruction of life and property th at will soon follow, but she cannot save the Jewish empire. It is doomed. Nor can we save it. Roosevelt is still working feverishly to that end but the result here will be what it has been in Eu- rope. They have not yet initiat ed pogroms in Europe but the people of France, Hungary, Rouman ia and Spain have disfran- chised the Jews, barred them from holding office, and from their newspaper activities. That must be done here. If it is not done the activities of the President and his Jewish administration will bring upon us the death and destruction that he has already caused in Europe. Our imperial President is now organizing us and the west- ern hemisphere for war. Our new Secretary of War Stimson is endeavoring to ramrod a compulsory conscription bill through Congress that will in volve an additional estimated annual ex- pense of $1,100,000,000.

There are but two things th at will keep us out when we are fully prepared: one is Roosev elt's defeat; the other that the war will be over. The war would now be over but for the interference of President Roosevelt. He is now telling Churchill the same story he told Reynaud: \"fight on, I am doing all I ca n.\" They would not continue this losing fight except for the fact that both of our presidential candidates are committed to war and we are making preparations to get into it at the earliest possible moment. England will likely soon surrend er but the Churchill plan is to remove the Briti sh government to Cana da and to continue the fight from there. The President is now seeking to line up the South American countries in order to mobilize a solid west- ern hemisphere front against Eur ope and Asia, and to do so is offering them $500,000,000 in some concealed form as a token of good faith. They appear to be su spicious of him,—and with good cause. The Argentine representative , Mr. Melo, ex pressed opposi- tion to \"sacrificing his country' s jurisdictional principles.\" He said very properly that the que stion of the disposition of the French and other islands should be left to the people of such islands and that the United States and the South American countries had no right to assume a \"collective trusteeship\" over them. He said also,—and congress should take note of it—that the \"proper time to cross a bridge is when it is reached,\" and that no action should be taken which is \"based on a mere hy- pothesis.\" A face-saving compromise was finally agreed upon which was signed by Mexico, Chile, Bo livia, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, and Argentina, subject to th e approval of th eir respective legislative bodies. Interpreted, it means that if they hereafter find it to their advantage to wo rk with the United States they will do so, otherwise they will not. It means pr ecisely nothing; the conference was a fizzle. But that small circumstance does not restrain the Admi nistration. Mr. Roosev elt still in sists in flagrant violation of our nati onal constitution that congress authorize the Export- Import Bank to lend the South American countries $500,000,000 which th ey will no doubt accept and which we will likely lose. The real purpose of the conference was not apparent on the surface. It was not primarily to establish a cartel for the pur- "},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"194 pose of acquiring and disposing of the products of the Americas; nor to establish a \"collective tr usteeship\" over the foreign-con- trolled islands of the western hemisphere. These were probably incidental objectives but they were not the moving cause of the Jews who brought about this conference. The true purpose of it was to weld the Americas and Ca nada together into a compact fighting unit and to preserve the gold standard. It was a Jew scheme concocted by the Jew A dolph Berle, Assistant Secretary of State, in furtherance of th eir purpose to destroy our govern- ment. The reason is war. The conference was held in anticipation of the British moving their govern ment to Canada, for there can be no long war otherwise. It was a step to incorporate the Americas into the British Empire , for otherwise the British have no means to prolong the war when they get here.

Party Government \"By the ceaseless praise of Democratic Rule we shall divide the Christians into political parties, we shall destroy the unity of their nations, we shall sow discord everywhere. Reduced to impotence, they will bow before the Law of Our Bank, always united, and always devoted to our Cause.\" —From Funeral Oration of Rabbi Reichhorn. (Addendum to Protocols.) It is shocking to learn that the Jews are responsible for the creation of political parties and that they have caused them to be organized for the purpose of promoting discord and con- fusion, and to subject us to the \"law of our bank.\" The rule of political parties has until recent years been univ ersal through- out the world even in those countries where the head of the nation was a king or an emperor. They have within the past few years been abolished in Germany, Italy, Spain, and Hungary, and more recently in Roumania and France, together with the Jewish Continental free masonr y and B'nai B'rith. These gov- ernments are now calle d \"totalitarian\" in co ntra-distinction to those ruled by the Jews and political parties called \"demo- cratic.\" We have all prided ourselves more or less on our party loy- alty and regularity. We boast th at we have ne ver \"scratched the ticket\" and that our fathers before us were democrats or republicans, as the case may be. We all believe that our party stands for sound economic and political policies and that the op- position party is agai nst them, and we are always ready to de- fend the party's principles as proclaimed in its platform. Observe the phrase \"l aw of our bank.\" It indicates that there is one law and one bank. Th ere is in fact but one Jewish law and one Jewish bank and it is \"always united and always devoted to our cause.\" Observe also the posse ssive, \"our bank.\" It is a direct recognition of the fact that this bank (the Roths- child bank) belongs to the Jewish race, and that the objective of this bank is the obj ective of the Jewish race. At the time of this Funeral Oration in 1869 the Jews gen- erally were desperately poor, w ithout citizenship, and living in squalor in the ghettos of the va rious cities of Europe. There are now many wealthy Jews but the wealth of many of them has stemmed from the Rothschild root. The Rothschild fortune, "},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"196 magnified as it has been duri ng the years since it was founded, with all of its branches and affiliates, is still \"united and devoted to our cause.\" It was devoted to that purpose by its founder, old Amschel, and it has b een so employed ever since. The \"law of our bank\" represents the ruthless law that has governed what we call \"high finance\" or \"Wall Street\" since the civil war. It represents the law that controls the Bank of England and other Rothschild banks. The record of the money power for the past 100 years dem onstrates the truth of the con- clusion that it is \"always united and always devoted to our cause,\" and that \"cause\" is the subjugation and enslavement of the Gentiles and the el evation and enthrone ment of the Jews. That is the present objective of Jeroboam Rothschild and his secret 300 Elders of Zion. They have sought to incorporate this international bank- ing power and to give it a legal status by establishing the Bank of International Settlements but to date the undertaking has not proven to be very successful. Under the pretense of providing a clearing house for th e settlement of Germ an reparations an international conference was held by government appointed rep- resentatives that resulted in the creation of this bank with a cap- ital of $100,000,000. President Hoover appointed Thos. W. Lamont and Owen D. Young as our repres entatives to this conf erence. J. P. Mor- gan & Co. subscribed $25,000,000 of the capital, the balance of the stock being subscribed by the Bank of England and other central banks. It is strictly a Rothschild super-bank for the purpose of regulating the economy and welfare of the people of the world. The \"law of our bank\" is also the law of the Jewish rabbi and the Jewish leaders. The Rothschilds and their Council of the Jewish Agency (the 300 Le arned Elders of Zion) are the despotic rulers of the Jewish race . The despot of Zion is already established so far as the Jews are concerned. Some of them are not active Zionists but they are all obedient, and most of them are sympathetic. This address of Rabbi Reichhorn was a carefully prepared statement of the plans and purposes of the Jewish race, made by a distinguished Jewish leader on a solemn occasion, in honor of a departed leader. It sets them forth with clarity and precision. It is copied in full in Appendix II at th e end of this book. "},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"197 We have been divided into two political parties here in America, viz: the democratic and republican, and the Rothschild banking interest through Baruch, Lamont, et al., and the lav- ish use of money has acquired cont rol of both of them. There is never any division between the parties where the vital interest of this malign power is concerned. A striking example of the truth of this statement is af- forded by the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act. It was first attempted through the repub lican party and having failed because of democratic opposition, the republican party was de- feated and it was then put over in disguise and by deception through the democratic party. We have just had two party conventions and the two par- ties have announced their platform s. There is a shade of differ- ence between them but not enou gh to enthuse over. In their essentials they are the same. They both pretend isolationism but they both nominate interven tionist candidates. They both stand for a continuation of th e New Deal, for Secretary Hull's reciprocal trade agreements, a nd for the regimentation of the people of America. The nominees of both parties are satisfactory to the Roths- child interest. The Br itish and the Jews and the Jew press hail Willkie's nomination as a great victory for the warmongers,— and so it was. They could affo rd to spend $100,000,000 to bring about his nomination, and they may have done so. Who knows? We do know that from the date of his announcement he was given great and favorable public ity by the Jew press, the Jew radio, and the Jew ci nema. Whenever his name was mentioned in the convention hall the packed Jew galleries responded with great applause. With a good radio one could distinguish the Yiddish accent and the soviet yell. The republicans could have won the election \"hands down\" with Dewey or Vandenberg or any other respectable non-inter- ventionist, but republican vict ory meant nothing to Baruch, Lamont, Lippman and the other Jew politicians. They want war. It is true the republican platform declares against war, but platforms mean nothing to a Jew warmonger or a Jew spon- sored candidate. He will do exac tly as the Jews want him to do, —as Roosevelt has done. If he va lues his life he will not dare doublecross the Rothschild power. The sponsors of the Willkie campaign were Barney Baruch representing the Kuhn, Loeb in terest and Thomas W. Lamont "},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"198 representing Morgan & Co. They were powerfully aided by the Jew press, radio, etc., and such columnists as Walter Lippman, Dorothy Thompson and other warm ongers. Some of these spon- sors were likewise sponsors fo r Roosevelt's third term. They no doubt prefer Roosevelt but fear their ability to elect him and they have therefore selected an opposition candidate who has pledged himself to carry out his and their program. \"The Day,\" calling itself \"The National Jewish Daily,\" printed in Yiddish at 183 East Broadway, New York City, Rabbi Samuel Margoshes, Editor, born in Galicia, published in English on July 7, 1940, the following amazing interview with Republican Presidential Nominee Wendell L. Willkie, in the Editor's column: \"I regard anti-Semitism in America as a criminal move- ment and every anti-Semite as a traitor to America. I spoke over the radio making clear my attitude toward the Jews, long before I even thought of becoming a candidate for the Presi- dency. I am glad to have an opportunity of expressing my sentiments again . . . What we require are laws by means of which we shall be enabled to eliminate those who would trans- plant on American soil the poisonous growth from Germany and other countries.\"* Mr. Willkie's secret commitment to the Jews sheds a flood of light upon the Jewi sh enthusiasm for him as shown in their press and the thousands of telegr ams sent to the republican na- tional convention delegates and the boisterous gallery applause. If the law that Mr. Willkie advocates is enacted then the author of this book is a traitor and is made a criminal, although every word contained in it is th e truth. It is no t the conclusions here stated that create anti-Sem itism but it is the conduct and purposes of the Jewish leaders that create it. The Jews have enough power without such a law. They have the power to per- secute and to injure any man who dares criticize them and they exercise it ruthlessly ,—and yet the truth must be told if con- ditions here pointed out are ever to be corrected by peaceful methods. So far as the Rothschild interest in concerned, it appears to be safe with either Roosevelt or Willkie. They no doubt pre- fer Roosevelt because he has proven to be their faithful and dependable servant but they will support Willkie if they think he stands the best ch ance of election. As to the balance of us, it is the difference between tweedledum and tweedledee. *R. E.

The Chicago democratic convention was a convention of job-holders and was a cut and dried affair; the most of the dele- gates to it had been selected by job-holders. Mr. Roosevelt and everyone else knew long before th e convention was held that he would be the nominee, and yet he chose to remain silent about his acceptance until after he wa s nominated. He then dramati- cally accepted it as a ca ll to service, stati ng that he had \"no de- sire or purpose\" to hold the office for a third term. He is in error. It has been his \"desire and purpose \" from the beginning, otherwise the convention would not have been stacked. It is simply Mr. Roosevelt's way of do ing things, to-wit: to say one thing and mean another. We must abolish political parties. This is not such a radical suggestion as it appears to be , but only a common sense one. There is no reason why any man should not be permitted to run for any office on his own platform , just as he does for a party nomination. There is no reason—ab solutely none—for two elec- tions, one for a party nomination and the other to be elected. The father of our country, George Washington, gave us good advice upon this subject, as we ll as upon the subject of for- eign entanglements. He strongly condemned party government.

This was the French system and is an improvement over our effete electoral college. It may require a constitutional amendment. This system will minimize many of the evils of a presiden tial election.

For still another it will minimize the constant and ever increasing encroachment of the Executive upon the powers of Congress, for the President will be accountab le to Congress. And for still another, it will tend to neutralize the powe r of the foreign vote of the large cities in the election of the President, since it will give all of the small states th e advantage of two senatorial votes. This will, as stated, involve a constitutional amendment, but the constitution itself makes pr ovision for its amendment. The process is a laborious and difficult one, but even so it is far bet- ter than the plan of the New Deal , viz: to change the constitu- tion through the interpretati ons of a hand picked court. Political parties were designed by the Jews to enable them to corrupt and control governments, and they have been useful instruments in their hands. Through them they can indirectly buy the members of a political part y when they could not reach them directly. We now have the sorry spectacle of southern political leaders such as Barkley, Bankhead and Ra yburn blindly supporting all of the vagaries and extravagan ces and unconstitutional reforms of the New Deal in violation of their professed political prin- ciples of a life time. It may be that none of these men could be bought directly and individually by Rothschild gold, but the party can be bought, and they can and are delivered by such purchase. The results are the same. Thei r country is \"sold down the river\" just as effectively and as completely as if each and every one of them had been personally corr upted. This is not peculiar to the democratic party. The rep ublican party is for sale and is sold like a sack of potatoes, and the leaders of the party are delivered like a sack of potatoes. We have become so inured and blind to party government that many of our politicians openly proclaim their fealty to party over their convict ions and their loyalty to their country. This is not peculiar to America and to our system of govern- ment. The same has until recently been true of every country of the world. It is through the corruption of political parties that the Jews have ruled the worl d; it is their brand of their boasted \"democracy.\" It was evidently true in England when the Peel amendment was adopted.

Isolationism does not present any such picture to \"t he overwhelming majority of Americans.\" We have been isola tionists all of our lives; it is the traditional policy our government, and we have never before feared the loss of our freedom and \"an unpitying master.\" A dictatorship does offer such a prospect but we have no fear of a foreign dictator. We do f ear, and with good reason, that Franklin D. Roosevelt will convert the Jew-deal into a Jew- dictatorship. This is merely inflammatory propaganda for the purpose of creating war sentiment. It is a gruesome, doleful picture that is calculated to scare us into anything. Suppose he gets us into war and becomes our di ctator, what assuranc e have we that he will be any better than \"the contemptuous unpitying masters of other continents\"? Churchill has not proven himsel f to be a better dictator than Hitler. He has imprisoned as \"fifth columnists\" the anti- Semitics and the critics of his administration, and he has pro- vided for the death penalty for them and has probably killed many of them. The \"unpitying ma sters of other continents\" could do no worse. Hitler has treated the Jews no worse. The Flanders retreat which Mr. Churchill ordered after honorable "},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"205 and reasonable terms of surrender had been proposed, was a massacre, the extent of which is not unknown. In the face of certain defeat Churchill appears to be willing to fight until the last Christian is killed. And for what? Not for the soldiers who are fighting a losing battle, nor for their families;—but to preserve an empire that is decayed with \"Jew- rot\" and that is operated \"by, of, and for\" the Jews. Another sample of Mr. Churchill's cruelty and ruthlessness has just been revealed by the pr ess report from France of June 15, 1940, as follows: \"Commenting on the French decision not to defend Paris, authorized spokesmen said: — \" 'For the first time reason prevailed, and for the first time the French acted against the will of the British who wanted a destroyed Paris for propaganda purposes. \" \"The French are beginning to see they always are called upon to pay the bill.' \" It appears that the French cabinet split up on this very rock. Reynaud, Handel, Blum, and the other Jews in the gov- ernment agreed to the British sc heme but Marshall Petain and the Gentiles refused. The Jewish members became exiles and the French government, after su ffering losses of 1,900,000 men in dead, wounded and prisoners, surrendered. And now the Brit- ish government through a renegade (DeGaulle) has organized an opposition government and is ni ghtly bombing French cities. Our government has also turned on her former ally (?) and has seized her gold st ored in the Kentucky va ults and her ships that are in our ports. We can now very well believe that the Germans are right in claiming that Churchill sank the \"Athenia\" for propaganda purposes. If he sought the destru ction of the grea t city of Paris with the thousands of helpless men, women and children who would necessarily be in it, for propaganda purp oses, he would not balk at the destruction of a ship with a few hundred peo- ple on it. The Associated Press of July 25th, 1940, reports that former Premier Daladier, Mandel (Roths child) and sixteen others were arrested on their return from Fr ench Morocco, where they fled two days before the armistice \"w as signed. The report states that they will be tried for treason for plunging the country into war, and that in the \"name of justi ce those responsible\" for the calam-"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"206 ity of France will be punished, and that \"on the day of their trial our dead will be pres ent among the accusers.\" The government of France now recognizes that the former Jewish government is responsible for the war, and not Germany. In their published statement they say \"we are buried under the ruins of a liberal parliame ntary capitalist regime. You have lived on lies. The hour of tr uth now has sounded.\" We will soon know the names of the conspirators who brought about this frightful destructive war. I fear that our beloved (?) humane (?) President Roosevel t will be found near the top of the list. We must stop the warmonger s and their wa r clamor. We must remove the filthy, hairy hands of the Jews from our press, cinema, radio, and the throats of th e people, even if it is neces- sary to confiscate their property and expel them from our coun- try. The remedy, it must be admitte d is a radical one, but their conduct and the c onditions that prevail ma ke necessary this or some other radical remedy. We have passed the stage when homeopathic remedies will do any good; it takes a major opera- tion. They will of course set up a great howl that the remedy is unconstitutional and will invoke the protection of a constitu- tion they are now seeking to de stroy, Mr. Roosevelt can suspend the constitution in case of war against a foreign foe or an emergency against a domestic foe. It can always be suspended for the preservation of our gover nment. We can and must sus- pend it, if it is necessary to that end. Unprepared as we are for war, he still seeks to provoke it. He appears to be still working to destroy this nation in order to rule it and to promote the Rothsc hild power. Despite the fact that the people of this country want to live in peace, he per- sists in his insane effort to in volve them in wa r. His appoint- ment of warmongers Henry L. Stimson as Secretary of War, and Frank Knox as Secretary of the Navy, means war. He forced the resignation of S ecretary Woodring because Wood- ring was opposed to war and to giving Great Britain our air- planes, munitions, etc.* His appointee Col. Frank Knox furnishes us with an apt description of Mr. Roosevelt's character and duplicity. He says that as a \"matter of tactics he will not avow his aim.\" And to *See Congressional Record, June 21, 1940, p. 13331 et seq."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"207 reach it he is ready to \"bow, smile, agree, assert, evade, deny, distort, distract, dela y, retreat, startle, dazzle, juggle, side- step, and circumvent.\" This is what Col. Knox said of him in his newspaper before his appointme nt as Secretary of the Navy. He said of him further that \"he is no more bound by precedent than by his own statements , .. It is bad enough to have for president in time of peace a ma n who is over-confident, incau- tious, self-willed, uncertain and unreliable. In time of war it would be disastrous.\"** This is what the protocols call \"cunning and make-believe,\" the qualities of an idea l Jewish ruler. That is a true pen-portrait of \"King Franklin, 1st,\" our present pseudo dictator and our future \"King-Despot\" by his pr esent Secretary of the Navy. The dictatorship is almost within his grasp. All that is needed is another emergency (the 65th) which he can and will declare at the first opportunity. Congre ss is the only bulwark that stands between us and the slavery that he so graphically de- scribed in his Charlottesville speech. In concluding the Charlottesville speech Mr. Roosevelt truly said, (for he sometimes in advertently tells the truth) : \"And the love of freedom is still fierce and steady in the nation today.\" We have inborn in us the spirit of freedom and we will not \"take our medicine lying down.\" It may mean much suffering to us but it is certain to mean th at we will rid ourselves in the end of the undesirable Jew, the Jew-in-law, and the hybrid. We have many minor problems th at should be solved right- eously, but this Administration is incapable of acting in that manner. The two major problems that confront us are: (1) Shall we cancel the bonded mortgage debts that we cannot pay? (2) Shall the Jew financial bu ccaneers and communists continue to rule us? We have lived in a fool's para dise in ignorance of our real ruler and his designs. We have worshipped our political parties that he fostered. We have had faith in our lying newspapers that he controls. We have swallowed his propaganda about an invasion and we are getting read y for war on a huge scale. We are preparing to exercise our choice between the two presi- dential candidates he has provided for us. We have accepted with fortitude all of the po verty and sufferi ng that he has **Congressional Record, June 21, 1940, p. 13859."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"208 brought upon us. The mighty power of tr uth will free us from our bondage. The Jews are now coming to this country in great numbers from all Europe, incl uding the British Empi re. We are in fact sending our ships for them. Congress appropriated $50,000,000 for the relief of refugees, the most of whom are Jews; and Roosevelt, without author ity, has appropri ated another $50,000,000. We are offering the Jews a home, despite the fact that they have betrayed our hospitality and that of every country in which they have lived. This immigrat ion must be stopped. The pend- ing election (November, 194-0) presents to every voter the opportunity to do his or her part to that end, and to save our government from their rule and thereby save ourselves.

Traitors \"I pass now to the method of confirming the dynastic roots of King David to the last strata of the earth . . . Certain members of the seed of David will prepare the kings and their heirs, selecting not by right of heritage but by eminent capa- cities, inducting them into the most secret mysteries of the political, into schemes of government, but providing always that none may come to knowledge of the secrets . . . \"Direct heirs will often be set aside from ascending the Throne if in their time of training they exhibit frivolity, soft- ness and other qualities that are the ruin of authority, which render them incapable of governing and in themselves danger- ous for kingly office. Only those who are unconditionally capable for firm, even if it be to cruelty, direct rule, will re- ceive the reins of rule from our learned elders.\" From Pro- tocol 24, The Associated Press of Augus t 18, 1940 quoted an amazing agreement made on that date between Franklin D. Roosevelt as President of the United States , and W. L. Mackenzie King as Prime Minister of the Dominion of Canada. The following is the text of the agreement as reported: \"It has been agreed that a permanent joint board of defense shall be set up at once by the two countries . . . It will consider in the broad sense, the defense of the north half of the Western Hemisphere.\" This agreement is in very broad terms and is subject to almost any interpretation one chooses to place upon it. The mildest interpretation th at can be pla ced upon it is that it con- stitutes a military alliance be tween the United States and the Dominion of Canada at a time wh en Canada is engaged in war with the totalitarian powers. There has been some speculation in the press as to whether or not the agreement involves th e transfer to Canada of fifty of our American destroyers to be used by Britain in her war with Germany and Italy. This tr ansfer was previously recom- mended by \"Sir\" John J. Pershing, and within a few days thereafter (less than a week ) we had a Gallu p poll upon it showing 62% of the American people favoring the transfer. It has been stated in the pres s that the President has advised with Attorney General Jackson a nd other subordinates who have informed him that it is not nece ssary to refer this coalition to Congress for confirmation. Up to this hour the President has "},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"210 not done so. It is extr emely doubtful if he w ill. He is not likely to do so unless he receives previous assurance that it will be confirmed. This agreement, like all other Jew schemes that have been perpetrated upon the American people, is not what it purports to be. It has been represented as affording us air bases in Canada and other British possess ions for the defense of the United States, and that it is but an extension of the Monroe Doctrine and does not commit the Un ited States to war except for defense of the wester n hemisphere. But that is not the inter- pretation that has been placed upon it by the British Govern- ment. Mr. Churchill and his associates understand its true meaning, and they were so rejoic ed over it that they could not refrain from giving us a slight glimpse of it. It has a meaning that the President and the Jew pr ess would not dare expose to Congress and to the American people. The following is a quotation from the Associated Press report from L ondon of August 20, 1940: \"Utterly confident, Prime Minister Churchill used his dis- closure of the plan for air-naval base leases to declare that the British Empire and the United States 'will have to be mixed together in some of their affairs for mutual and general advantage.' \"'No one can stop it!' he cried. 'Like the Mississippi, it just keeps rolling along, let it roll! Let it roll on full flood, irresistible, to broader lands and better days' \" \"Tumult from the House of Commons steep and crowded benches almost smothered the Prime Minister's last words.\" Does anyone imagine for a moment that the mere leasing of air-bases, or a military pact for the protection of the United States would have occasioned th e burst of eloquence of Prime Minister Churchill and the tumu lt and enthusiasm of the House of Commons? The former Jew war minister , Mr. Hore-Belisha, let the cat out of the bag in his statem ent regarding th e matter, which the Associated Press of the same date quotes as follows: \"In the House of Commons tonight Leslie Hore-Belisha, the former War Secretary, rais ed the possibility of 'an even- tual common citizenship' of Britain and the United States, and said this alone would almost compensate for 'the evils of war.' Such a union, Hore-Belisha recalled, was offered, in vain, to France in the hour of the third Republic's collapse.\" ... Observe that he says th at they offered the same thing \"to France in the hour of the third Re public's collapse. \" That offer"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"211 was to absorb France into the British Empire. Observe also that Hore-Belisha states that this innocent appearing pact \"would almost compensate (Bri tain) for the evils of war.\" These shrewd Jews always know the \"low down,\" and they are so conceited that they ca nnot refrain from bragging. Thus, according to the views of Messrs. Churchill and Hore- Belisha, the true meaning of this agreement is that we have sacrificed our independence as a nation and have been merged into the British Empire as on e of its dominions. And thus, without consulting Congress or the American people, we have become not only a part of the British Empire, but we have entered the war against the totalitarian powers. This program is not a new scheme just invented by Presi- dent Roosevelt and his \"kitchen ca binet.\" It is the adopted plan of the Elders and the managers of the Rothschild Trust to establish their world empire. They control, and have for many years controlled the British Empire . It has been ruled ostensibly by a king and his cabinet, but in fact by the Jews. This plan is set out in detail in the Col. E. M. House letter.* The real author of this letter is unknown, and because of that fact the letter itself was discredited. Evidently the author was not Col. House, nor was it Dr. Wm. J. Maloney.** The letter shows upon its fa ce that it was written by a Jew and by a person holding a hi gh official posi tion with the British Government at the time (June 10, 1919). It was written upon the stationery of the Britis h consulate of New York City and addressed to the Hon. David Lloyd-George, then Prime Min- ister of England. It was probably written either by the Jew, Sir Wm. Wiseman, who was at that time \"British Intelligence Representative and now with Kuhn, Loeb & Co.,\"*** or by the Jew, Lord Northcliffe, who was at th at time head of the British Propaganda Department. While there is doubt as to the iden- tity of the actual author, there can be none as to the authenticity of the letter. The Jew can always be depended upon to hide his identity and to dest roy the proof of it, if it is possible to do so. Because of the length of the letter it is not reproduced in its entirety. I trust that th e following excerpts will be suf- *Congressional Record, Oct. 11, 1939, p. 598-603. **Congressional Record Oct. 18, 1939. ***C ongressional Record, Oct. 18, 1939, p. 981. "},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"ficient to show its verity and its character. The letter reveals the powerful forces that are now at work to overthrow this govern- ment and to bring it back into the British Empire as a dominion, and it reveals the tr aitors who are cooper ating with the British the the Jews to that end. I quote the following paragraphs from it: \"'Our thanks are due to Messr s. Taft and Polk, who elab- orated with us our German-Irish plot programme. To Mr. Baker and the innumerable library committees who banned from the camps the anti-British books on our index expurga- torious. To Mr. Gregory, who lent punitive force to our wishes regarding spoken and written speeches. And Messrs. Pierpont Morgan, Rockefeller, Clevela nd Dodge, Wanamaker, Hamlin, Childs, DuPont, Ryan, Insull, Doheny, and others of our friends who financed our 'Americanization' campaign. I would espe- cially call attention to the beneficence of Messrs. Insull, and Doheny, who were the generous supporters of the diversion, devised by Messrs. Taft and O'Connor, entitled, 'Ireland Stabbed England in the Back.' These contributors doubtless will be, or have been, appropriately rewarded by His Majesty's Government.\" The Mr. Baker referred to in this paragraph was then our Secretary of War, and the Mr . Gregory was our Attorney General. I do not kno w whether any of th ese gentlemen \"have been appropriately rewarded by His Majesty's Government.\" \"Through the Red Cross, the Scout movement, the Y. M. C. A., the church, and other humane, religious, and quasi-religious organizations, we have created an atmosphere of international effort which strengthens the idea of unity of the English-speaking world. In the coordination of this work, Mr. Raymond Fosdick, formerly of the Rockefeller Foundation, has been especially conspicuous. I would like to mention President Nicholas Murray Butler of Columbia Uni- versity, who has eloquently advoc ated this form of inter- nationalism and carefully emphasized its distinction from the false internationalism which is infecting the proletariat.\" It is well known that Nicholas Murray Butler is an Anglo- phile, but Mr. Raymond Fosdick' s position has not been so conspicuous. The distinction betw een the form of true inter- nationalism and false internationalism is im perceptible, but all of it is bad, and none of it fits in with our scheme of government. \"To all ages and classes, to every phase of human activity, by all channels of human communications, our propaganda per- meates. Our command over the cables and press, the schools and the universities, the pulpit and the tribunes, will tend to increase.

It states a truth which should be apparent to all of us, every day of our lives; we get nothing from either the press or the radio or the cinema that does not favor th e British. They let \"nothing pass\" that tends to present any other point of view. \"May I also call your attention to the services of Prof. Richard Gotthell, of Columbia University (the one who pinned the medal on F. D. Roosevelt in 1937 for his distinguished service to world Jewry), in our campaign against the Hindus, and of Miss Elisabeth Marbury and Messrs. Charles McCarthy and Karl Watters in that against the Irish . . . \"The cost of converting an American into a colonist of His Majesty is now 63 cents. Our e xpenses we have met by a levy on the population.\" The statement made in pare nthesis about the Roosevelt medal evidently is comm ent and not a part of the so-called House letter. While we appear to be cheap, particularly in the eyes of the Jews, I do not believe that the American people can be bought at the rate of 53 cents a head. If that were true we would have been a part of the British Empire long ago. It is a part of the Jew character to over-estimate himself and his money, and to under-estimate the \"goi.\" \"In the financial world the A nglo-American alliance is a well-established fact. And as the consortium for China, and the security company for Mexico show, our brokers and their aids have become the unchallenged financiers of the world. We have been particularly fortunat e in our fiscal agents here, Messrs. Pierpont Morgan & Co. . . . \"Their services in putting this country into the war may not have been altruistic, but they were nonetheless effective. They contributed liberally to our Americanization campaign. They ousted Miss Boardman, a nd through Messrs. Taft and H. P. Davidson they nationalized and directed the American Red Cross, and then internationalized it under the direction of Mr. H. P. Davidson. Through Mr. Thomas Lamont they purchased Harpers Magazine and the New York Evening Post. Through advertisers they control, they have exerted wide- spread influence on newspaper policy. \"Messrs. Lamont and Davidson gave you valuable aid at the peace conference. They loaned $200,000,000 to Japan that our ally might build a fleet to compete with America on the Pacific carrying routes. Their atte mpts to retain for us con- trol of the international mercantile marine are well known to you.\""},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"214 The Anglo-American finance a lliance has been heretofore pointed out. It is the ownership of our principal financial insti- tutions through the Rothschild mo ney trust. We know about the services of Morgan & Co., in ge tting us into the war; about Mr. Davidson's direction of the Red Cross, and about Mr. Lamont's valuable aid at the peace conference; but we did not know that \"they loaned $200,000,000 that Britain's ally (Japan) might build a fleet to compete with America on the Pacific carrying routes.\" That is rank treason to our country on the part of the firm of Morgan & Co. It is rank treason to America on the part of its ally, the British Government. And it is this same British Gov- ernment that is now pleading with us to rescue them from their own machinations and infamy. Please note the statement that \"our brokers and their aids have become the unchallenged fi nanciers of the world.\" These \"brokers\" are N. M. Rothschild & Sons and they have been the \"unchallenged\" financiers of the world for more than a hundred years. The firm of Morgan & Co . is not an \"aid\" but a branch. Observe also their purchase of Harpers Magazine and the New York Evening Post, and particul arly note that the British re- gards the firm as its agency,—\" our broker.\" It is, however, the \"other way round\"; the British Government is the agency of \"our brokers.\" \"With moneys lent to us by the American Government for war purposes, we have, acting through quasi-American com- panies, by the aid of Mr. Connor Guthrie, obtained control of the large oil fields in Calif ornia and in Costa Rica. And through the nationalization by His Majesty's Government of the Cowdray, Person, and Royal Dutch Shell interests in Mexico, we, having become masters of the Mexican, Canadian, Roumanian, Armenian, Persian, and lesser oil fields, now largely control the oil fuel of the world and thereby the world's transportation and industry. We have not yet succeeded in controlling the pipe lines owned by the Standard Oil Co. and its subsidiaries, for those companies have long been estab- lished.\" This is also a revealing stat ement. We knew in a general way that \"His Majesty's Govern ment had acquired large oil interests in Mexico and other countries,\" but we did not know that the $4,000,000,000.00 we loaned Britain was used to acquire these oil interests and to obtai n a monopoly of the oil resources of the world. "},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"215 \"This control (of world's oil supply) would enable us to exert such pressure as would make American industrial in- terests amenable to His Majesty's pleasure. But it would be unwise to make disciplinary use of our fuel power before we secure remission of our $4,000,000,000.00 debt. Otherwise, the American industrial interests might retaliate by forcing the United States Government to exact from us the agreed inter- est, to maintain tariff barriers against our merchandise, and to withdraw support from the rate of exchange, which would make our labor and resources for years pay tribute to this country (United States), an unnatural, unfilial, and un- thinkable proceeding. \"We are conducting a vigorous campaign for the can- cellation of this war debt, on the grounds (a) that we fought America's fight for her for 2 y ears, while she was prospering in cowardice; and (b) that at least the material burdens should be distributed justly, if the world is to be made safe for democracy. Synchronously with this agitation for the remission of our debt, we are agitating for further loans of American money to rebuild our markets in Europe . . . In these agitations we are receiving valuable, if not wholly disinteres ted, aid from our financial auxiliaries and fiscal agents.\" If this is not treachery of the basest sort, what do you call it? They've got our money, used it to buy up the oil properties of the world, and are seeking to escape payment of it. When they have accomplished that, they propose to make \"disciplinary use of our fuel power in orde r to make American industrial interests amenable to His Majest y's pleasure.\" They add insult to injury by the statement that \"We fought America's fight for her for 2 years while she was prospering in cowardice.\" And the grounds here stated are the grounds upon which they are seeking to cancel their debt to us,—leaving out of course the word \"cowardice.\" However, we are quietly continuing our work in Mexico until the United States Government shall be put in a position to take it over. An American war with Mexico would cost us nothing; it would satisfy certain American industrial inter- ests; it would guarantee our title to the Mexican oil fields; it would humble, by impoverishing, this purse-proud people; it would give us an opportunity to show the American that he —isolated in the world—needs our protection against our ally, Japan; and while America was busy warring we would enjoy a clear field in the European, African, and Asiatic trade, to- gether with the monopoly of the markets of a South America hostile to the Monroe Doctrinaries of democracy. For these reasons our press is fully reporting Mexican outrages, but a"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"216 strange apathy seems to have fallen on the people, an apathy from which only border raids or special atrocities will arouse them.\" Thus it appears that Britain has been seeking to promote war between us and Mexico because it would \"cost us nothing .. . it would guarantee our title to the Mexican oil fields ... it would humble, by impoverishing, this purse-proud (American) people; it would give us an opportunity to show the American that he— isolated in the world—needs ou r protection against our ally, Japan.\" \"Below that level, imperial un ity cannot be securely estab- lished upon the debris of the Constitution here (in America). We will not passively permit this unity to be now menaced when it is all but perfect. Has not America, while still main- taining an outward show of independence, yielded to our wishes in the Panama Canal tolls and Canadian fisheries' disputes, as was fitting and filial? Was not America happy to fight our war in Europe? Was not America, like Canada, willing not only to pay her own war expenses but also to loan us money for ours? Was not America, like Canada, content to seek nothing in return for her war duty, so long as the mother-land was completely indemnified in Egypt and the rest of Africa, in Persia, Mesopotamia, Syria, and elsewhere? Was not Amer- ica as proud to be honored by knighthood and lesser titulary distinctions, as Canada was, or, rather, more proud? Has not President Wilson canceled the big Navy program and dutifully conceded to us the command of th e seas, confident that we shall defend America against all future foes that may threaten our supremacy, just as we defended America and Canada, against Germany?\" Alas, all of these achievemen ts have been accomplished. They have been sugar-coated in such way that our people did not know they were serving th e purposes of the British, but thought that they were doing the right thing. \"But I regret to inform yo u that our Committee on Amer- ican Elections has reported (Appendix 38) that no matter how lavishly we finance the next election, the Wilson administration will pass, and with it, perchance, that absolute administrative control over the Legislature, wh ich has meant so much to us. Willful, wanton, and wicked men will unite in the next election with labor and those industrialists whose profit-patriotism ratio has been allowed to fall below the threshold of loyalty to imperial unity. These combined forces of disorder will seek to elect a Legislature which will attempt to make the admin- istration responsible to it, instea d of to us and our auxiliaries, and will strive to rend the bonds which bind this colony to the mother-land, for the sole, self ish, and seditious purpose of"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"217 erecting a separate, national, economic unit independent of us—and even, perhaps, competi ng with us. We must, there- fore, hasten to remove from this Legislature, with the aid of our supporters here, such of its powers as could be used against imperial unity. \"In other words, we must quickly act to transfer its dangerous sovereignty from this colony to the custody of the Crown. We must, in short, now bring America within the Empire. God helping us, we can do no other. The first visible step in this direction has been taken; President Wilson has accepted and sponsored the plan for a League of Nations which we prepared for him. We have wrapped this plan in the peace treaty so that the world must accept from us the League or a continuance of the war. The League is in substance the Empire with America admitted on the same basis as our other colo- nies.\" And so the British Government has a \"Committee on Ameri- can Elections\" and they finance these elections even \"lavishly\" where there is a chance to win; otherwise they refuse to put up the money. They ca n afford to spend mo ney \"lavishly\" for they are playing for high stak es, viz: to can cel a $4,000,000,- 000.00 debt and to save the tottering Jewish-British Empire. This financing is obviously done through \"our broker\" (N. M. Rothschild & Sons). We do not know with certainty who com- pose the \"Committee on American Elections,\" but I think I can name three of its members, viz: \"Sir\" Thomas W. Lamont, Sir William Wisemann, and Sir ( ? ) B. M. Baruch. Unfortunately for the schemes of these conspirators, the democratic party was thrown out of power, and unfortu nately for them also, Congress refused to ratify th e League of Nations. Their intimate knowledge of President Wilson and his weaknesses, and of the best me thod of approach, is uncanny: \"Our best policy, therefore, would be to appoint President Wilson first president of the League . . . \"He is easily slighted and remarkably vindictive. It is the highest degree desirable that any traces of resentment his mind may be harboring against us should be radically removed before he returns. I would, therefore, suggest that the work of adulation planned in appendix 32 should be intensively con- tinued. The adulators, however, should be instructed to con- sult the inventories I have prepared (appendices 45-83), which show that he is now surfeited with diamond stomachers, brooches, and bracelets, Gobelin tapestries, mosaics, and vases, gold caskets, and plates . . . \"The pressing need of our embassy at Washington is not"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"218 so much an ambassador as a gentleman in waiting to the President. \"I would suggest that his powers as President of the League of Nations be left unde fined for the present. He may be trusted to assume what power he can and to use it in the interest of the Crown. \"A grant of a privy purse of $100,000,000 would prove most acceptable to him, and would be useful for private espi- onage, private wars, Siberian railroads, etc. His appointment should be for life, and you might definitely promise him that any instruction he may care to convey concerning his successor will receive the most careful a ttention of His Majesty's Gov- ernment . . . \"No one understands this peculiarity (hero worship) of the native behavior better than Mr. Wilson, which accounts largely for his exceptional usefulness to us. He knows that Americans will not scrutinize any performance closely, pro- vided their faith in the performer has been adequately estab- lished. Mr. Wilson has since made the transfer amid American acclamation. In the same way he will now be able to satisfy them that far from surrendering their independence to the League they are actually extending their sovereignty by it.\" They made the naive suggestion: \"I would suggest that as soon as the President is settled once more in the White House, the visit should be returned by His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, who would be an admirable representative of His Royal Sire, and would satisfy President Wilson's sense of fitn ess. It is parhaps unfortunate that there is not a Presidential daughter of the Prince's age, for such a union would have greatly advanced our purpose not only with the American people, but also with a President who feels that lese majeste should be punishable with 20 years' imprisonment, and who acts as if he considered his son-in-law, Mr. McAdoo, as his heir apparent.\" The Prince of Wales referred to is the present Duke of Windsor. \"Would you, however, kindly give instructions to the pub- lishers of Whittaker Almanac, and of the Official Register to delete, in their next issue, from their list of British knights, the names of Sir John Biddle, Sir Tasker Bliss, Sir P.

Perhaps you, yourself, might condescend to visit this country. Or, if that be impracticable, you might send such noble statesmen, and stately noble men, as will suffice to make of the first League session a spectacle of unsurpassed bril- liance,\" This is Jewish ingenuity with a vengeance. They them- selves are great advertisers an d great hands to put on a show, and they think that \"these simple people\" (meaning Americans) will be over-awed by such a spectacle! They give us a glimpse of th e character of government we are to have when we become a dominion of the British Empire, or a member of the League of Nations, which they consider the same thing: \"By these means we hope smoothly to overcome all effec- tive opposition on the part of our colony, America, to entering the League—that is, the Empire. As soon as the League is. functioning properly, His Majesty, in response to loyal and repeated solicitation, might graciously be pleased to consent to restore to this people their ancient right to petition at the foot of the throne; to confer the ancient rank and style of governor general upon our Ambassador, that this colony may enjoy a status inferior to no other colony's; to establish the primacy of the metropolitan see, with the Right Reverend Dr. Manning as first primate; to appoint Mr. Elihu Root lord chief justice of the colony, and to nominate Messrs. W. H. Taft, Nicholas Murray Butler, J. P. Morgan, Elisabeth Marbury, Adolph Ochs, and Thomas Lamont to the colonial privy coun- cil; as a special mark of royal and imperial condescension, to rename the Federal Capital of the colony Georgetown, and lest section jealousy be thereby excited, to grant royal charters to the cities of Boston and Chicago entitling them thereafter to style themselves, respectively, Kingston and Guelf—con- cisely to bestow in time and in measure such tokens of the bounty of the Crown as the fealty of the colonists merit.\" Mr. Roosevelt had his hand in bringing about this war, if he is not in fact the prime m over. It was his purpose to bring about a League of Nations. He ha s frequently stated that he would assist in writing the peace treaty. The \"United States of Europe\" is none of our affair, bu t a League of Nations in which "},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"220 we are a member is a matter of importance to us. The League of Nations would probably begin as a British Empire and it would inevitably end as a Jewish Empire. \"The object of Cecil Rhodes is almost attained. The day prophesied by Mr. Carnegie is near at hand, the day when the American Colonies will be in all thinge one with the mother- land, one and indivisible. Only the last great battle remains to be fought—the battle to compel her acceptance of the terms of the League of Nations. I have frankly stated the difficulties which confront us, and the vital necessity of the League to the British Nation.\" These two huge foundations, viz: the Carnegie and the Rhodes, were established for th e avowed purpose of destroying our government and re-establishing our status as a dominion of the British Empire. But far more menacing than that fact is the fact that it is also the secret purpose of the ma nagers of the Rothschild money trust. The prime objective on the part of the cons pirators who brought about the present war, wa s to establish the League of Nations. The prime object of President Roosevelt was to be president of this League. If it had been established he would undoubtedly have gotten the job. He met the requirements of the protocols far better than Pr esident Wilson who was slated for it, for Wilson was an idealis t with a sense of right and wrong. These characteristics are u tterly foreign to Roosevelt's nature; he is a \"diplomat\" who rules by \"cunn ing and make- believe.\" A life tenture at $100,00 0,000.00 a year is an attractive prospect for him and his thrifty family. So far as the facts stated in the alleged House letter are known to me, they are true.

Thes e are facts, however, that can be easily proven if true, or disproven if untrue. The letter quoted contains too much truth and the truth is too important to us to reject it on the mere ground that the author is unknown. It is, I submit, an authentic letter and it con- tains the authentic, well defined plan of the conspirators for the destruction of our government.

Slavery \"The flooding of the United States with cheap coolie labor will reduce wages, thus gradually making it more difficult for the man in ordinary circumstan ces to spare enough money to support his children during the time they should be in school, and thereby making it necessary for children's education to be reduced to the level of the children of the poor in England, which would tend in a very short time to make for a sharp class distinction or 'illiterate ra bble.' This latter class is re- garded as very desirable in England, as the more ignorant the lower classes, the more easily they are controlled.\" From Congressional Record, Aug. 21, 1940, p. 16378. The text quoted above could very well have been taken from the protocols or the Talm ud, for it contains the philosophy of both, viz: the enslavement of the people. It is, however, a quotation from an article by Lillian Scott Troy, published in The San Francisco Leader in February 1912, and re-published by Congressman J. Th orkelson in th e Congressional Record. The author states that it is in substance a quotation from a \"book written by Lieutenant Colo nel Lowther, military secre- tary and official mouthpiece of the Duke of Connaught.\" It is a frank explanation of the sordid poverty that now prevails in England and that has existed since the enactment of the Peel amendment and the repeal of the Corn laws (tariff) in 1844. This was the date the Rothschild s obtained contro l of the eco- nomic welfare of the people of E ngland through the Peel amend- ment. The reader should note the fact that \"sha rp class distinction or illiterate rabble\" have been produced in England designedly. They are in fact the direct result of banker controlled prices and wages, free labor and fr ee trade. The fact should also be noted that this poverty is regarded as \"very desirable\" by the Jewish plutocrats in England for the reason that \"the more ignorant the lower classes, the more easily they are controlled.\" We have the same powerful for ces at work in this country, viz: banker control of our ec onomy and free labor and free trade, called interna tionalism. These forces are producing pre- cisely the same results that th ey have produced in England, and for precisely the same purposes. These results represent the philosophy of Morgan & Co., Ku hn, Loeb & Co., Franklin D. "},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"223 Roosevelt, and Wendell Willkie. They represent the philosophy of the Jew Deal and the objectives of the Jew Deal Administra- tion. It is the common purpose of all of them to elevate them- selves and to enslave the people through poverty. We have burdened ourselves with a debt of $15,000,000,000 and have entered the war throug h the back door to save this brand of \"democracy,\" viz: a de mocracy that exalts the rich and oppresses the poor. Our plutoc rats are seeking to restore our country to the British Empire in order that they may be- come lords, barons, counts, and sirs, and that the mass of the people may be the \"illiterate rabble\" and consequently \"the more easily controlled.\" Unfortunately, the election of Mr. Willkie promises no relief. The Jew press applauded his statement to the effect that he could not promise much hope, that we must all make sacri- fices, and that we must recove r the ground we have lost \"the hard way.\" It can't be done. His acceptance speech was a rati- fication of the New Deal, including deflation, its reciprocal trade treaties, its conscription of an army in peacetime, and its gift of fifty of our destroyers to the British. He appear s to be only a dummy candidate in order to in sure the election of Roosevelt. Messrs. Willkie and Roosevelt, however, do not themselves propose to travel \"the hard wa y.\" The greatest achievement of Wendell Willkie is that he sold hi s power plants to the Jew Deal Administration at an exorbita nt price, to-wit: $76,000,000, and that he resigned an annual sala ry of $75,000 to become a presi- dential candidate. The Roosevelt Administration ha s been distinguished by the fact that it has been an exceedin gly profitable one to the Roose- velt family. The Chicago Tribune estimates that the President and his family have made $2,75 0,000 during his seven years in office. (It would be interesting to know how much of that has been paid out in income taxes.) Both President Roosevelt and Wendell Willkie are second- rate New York lawyers. They both appear, however, to have been first-rate promoters. They are both presidential candidates hand-picked for us by the Rothschild interest. It is not of much consequence to the Rothschilds or to the British plutocracy which one is elected, fo r their interests will be safe with either. "},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"The chances are that they prefer Roosevelt because he is the smarter of the two. The leading feature of Willkie's acceptance speech was his challenge to Roosevelt to debate. What issue? Not the tariff issue; they stand together on that. Not the destruction of the Rothschild control of our economy (which is the most important issue) ; they stand together on that. Not \"taxing, lending, and spending\"; they stand together on that. Not internationalism; they stand together on that. Not co nscription; they stand together on that. Not the gift of our destroyers to Great Britain; they stand together on that. Not the issue of intervention in the present war; they stand together on that. Apparently the only issue be tween them is which one can best administer the New Deal, which, interpreted, means which one can best serve the Rothschild interest, Roosevelt has made a pretty good job of it and there appears to be no valid reason for the Rothschilds to want a chan ge. Indeed, it is doubtful if there will be, because if Mr. Roosevelt finds that he will likely be defeated he will declare the election off, and will be sup- ported by his Attorney General, our democratic representatives in congress, and Willkie will accept the situation with good grace. Mr. Willkie is reported to have said that he did not desire the support of Father Coughlin or of any other anti-Semitic. This Willkie is not worthy to t ouch the hem of Father Coughlin's garment. Father Coughlin is everything that Willkie is not, and Willkie is everything that Fath er Coughlin is not. The differ- ence between them is the difference between daylight and dark- ness, between a bold patriot and a time-ser ving politician, be- tween a man who seeks to elevate the masses and one who is willing to serve the selfis h interests of the classes. I appeal to the members of Congress: Many of the facts stated in these pages are probably unknown to you, but as far as you know them you must know that they are true. The facts you do not know are also true. You may wish to ignore the \"House letter,\" but it contains too much truth to permit you to do so.

Such a ticke t will sweep the country. I appeal to the American people to support your ticket. In the last analysis it all gets back to us, the people. Do we intend to surrender our liberty without a protest and without a fight? It is within our power to rede em our government by the ballot, and without bloodshed and revolution . We know that the elec- tion of either Roosevelt or Willkie means war and a dictatorship, and probably the submerging of our government into the British Empire. Shall we permit Roosev elt and Willkie and Morgan & Co., Kuhn, Loeb & Co., and the Ro thschild trust to take over our government? We must throw off the shackles that bind us. We must defeat our subservient congressm en. We must support any man, no matter upon what ticket, who stands for America. We must put country above party.

APPENDIX II. \"Funeral Oration\" The Fatal Discourse of Rabbi Reichhorn [\"(In its issue of 21 October, 1920 (N o. 195) La Vieille France published an extremely important Russian document in which the following passage occurs: \" 'There is a striking analogy between the Protocols of the Elders of Zion and the discourse of the Rabbi Reichhorn, pro- nounced in Prague in 1869 over th e tomb of the Grand Rabbi Simeon-ben-Ihuda, and published by Readcliffe, who paid with his life for the divulgation. Sonol, who had taken Readcliffe to hear Reichhorn, was killed in a duel some time afterwards. The general ideas formulated by the Rabbi are found fully developed in the Protocols,' (which were published about 35 years later). \"In its issue of 10 March, 1921, (No. 214) La Vieille France gives the version of this funera l oration which was published in La Russie Juive. It is perfectl y clear that the funeral oration and the Protocols of th e Elders of Zion come from one and the same mint. Both are prophetic; and the power which made the prophecies has been able to bring about their fulfillment. There can no longer be any doubt as to whose is the power which is disturbing the world, creating World Unrest, and at the same time reaping all of the profits. Jewry is enslaving all Christian peoples of the earth. There IS a Jew World Plot and it now stands finally and co mpletely unmasked).] \"1.
