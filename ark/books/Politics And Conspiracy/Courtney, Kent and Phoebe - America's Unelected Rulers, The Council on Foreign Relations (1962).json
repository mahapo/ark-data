Most citizens don't rea- lize it exists, yet the Establishment makes its influence felt from the President's Cabinet to the professional life of a young college teacher who wants to obtain a foundation grant for research . It affects the nation's policies in almost every area . . . . The Estab- lishment is a general term for those people in finance, business, and the professions, largely from the Northeast, who hold the prin- cipal measure of power and influence in this country irrespective of what administration occupies the White House . The syndicated columnist, Edith Kermit Roosevelt described the policies of the Establishment as follows : What is the Establishment's viewpoint? Through the Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy Administrations, its ideology is constant : that the best way to fight Communism is by a One- World, Socialist State governed by \"experts\" like themselves . The result has been policies which favor the growth of the super-state, gradual surrender of U .S . sovereignty to the United Nations, and a steady retreat in the face of Communist aggression . On February 23, 1954, Senator William Jenner stated : Today the path to total dictatorship in the United States can be laid by strictly legal means, unseen and unheard by the Congress, the President, or the people . . . . Outwardly we have a Constitu- tional government . We have operating WITHIN our government and political system, ANOTHER body representing another form of government, a bureaucratic elite which believes our Constitution is outmoded and is sure that it is the winning side . . . . All the strange developments in foreign policy agreements may be traced to this group who are going to make us over to suit their pleasure . We must consider our danger not only in the terms of the treaties or agreements which have been completed, but in terms of those still in the pipelines, or already in effect, but still invisible to Congress or to the people . . . .

Someone, somewhere, con- ceived the brilliant strategy of revolution by the assembly line . The pattern for total revolution was divided into separate parts, each of them as innocent, safe, and familiar-looking as possible . The men who made the blueprints know exactly WHAT the final product is to be . They have planned the final assembly years ahead . (Emphasis ours) Garet Garrett, in his book \"The Revolution Was,\" published in 1944, referred to the Establishment as \"the revolutionary elite .\" Mr . Garrett listed the aims of the revolutionary elite as follows : (a) To ramify the authority and power of executive govern- ment -- its power, that is, to rule by decrees and rules and regulations of its own making ; (b) To strengthen its hold upon the economic life of the nation ; (c) To extend its power over the individual ; (d) To degrade the parliamentary principle ; (e) To impair the great American tradition of an independent, Constitutional judicial power ; (f) To weaken all other powers -- the power of private enter- prise, the power of private finance, the power of state and local government . (g) To exalt the leader principle . In an article appearing in the May, 1962, issue of ESQUIRE, en- titled \"The American Establishment,\" Richard H . Rovere states : It is interesting to observe the workings of the Establishment in presidential politics . As I have pointed out, it rarely fails to get one of its members, or at least one of its allies, into the White House . In fact, it generally is able to see to it that both nominees are men acceptable to it . Mr . Rovere was apparently echoing a similar statement made by Senator William E . Jenner in February, 1956, when Jenner stated : Every president since 1933 has been the captive of the govern- mental elite .

High in the ranks of Establishment members is Arthur M . Schles- inger, Jr ., former professor of history at Harvard University, now a special assistant to President John F .Kennedy . In a periodical entitled PARTISAN REVIEW, dated May-June, 1947, there appears an article by Arthur M, Schlesinger, Jr . In describing the PARTISAN REVIEW, Congressman John Rousselot of California stated that it \"is actually read only by professional intellectual So- cialists of all shades, from the out-and-out pro-Communist to the Fabian-Keynesian Socialist . . . . It is almost unknown outside the pro- fessional Leftist group . They use it to inform each other of their plans and projects .\" Congressman Rousselot then inserted into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of September 26, 1961, an article written in 1947 by Schles- inger, which Mr . Rousselot termed \"a blueprint of the plan for turn- ing the people of the United States over to a monolithic Socialist- Fascist-Marxist type of tyranny,\" Below are only a few excerpts from the Schlesinger article of 1947 which clearly reflect the thinking of the man who today holds the po- sition of Special Advisor to President Kennedy . Socialism appears quite practicable . . . as a long-term propo- sition . Its gradual advance might well preserve order and law, keep enough internal checks and discontinuities to guarantee a measure of freedom, and evolve new and real forms for the ex- pression of democracy . The active agents in effecting the trans- ition will probably be, not the working class, but some combination of lawyers, business and labor managers, politicians, and intellec- tuals, in the manner of the first New Deal, or of the Labor Govern- ment in Britain . Discussing how the Socialists intend to takeover the United States, Schlesinger, in the same article, stated : If Socialism (i .e ., the ownership by the State of all significant means of production) is to preserve democracy, it must be brought about step by step, in a way which will not disrupt the fabric of custom, law, and mutual confidence . . . That is, the transition must be piecemeal ; it must be parliamentary ; it must respect civil li- berties and due process of law . Socialism by such means used to seem fantastic to the hard-eyed melodramatists of the Leninist persuasion ; but even Stalin is reported to have told Harold Laski"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"4 \t\t FOREWORD recently that it might be possible . Mr . Schlesinger's concern regarding legalities is ominously re- miniscent of Hitler's regard for \"legalities\" as he took over Ger- many in the '30s . In this connection it is also noteworthy that the 1961 edition of Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary defines Hitler's National Socialism as \"the body of political and economic doctrines held and put into effect by the National Socialist German Workers' Party in the Third German Reich, including the totalitarian principle of government and state control of all industry . . . .\" THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK (1) What \"fronts\" are used by the Establishment to carry out its goals of turning the United States into a Socialist state, and sub- jecting the United States to the control of a Socialist world order? (2) Who are the individuals carrying out the Establishment's pro- grams ? (3) Who finances the activities of the Establishment? (4) How have members of the Establishment infiltrated key policy positions of the U .S . Government? The purpose of this book is to give documented answers to the above questions . In addition we will show the giant interlock between : (a) The Foreign Aid program (b) The Foreign Trade program (c) The Common Market program (d) Organizations promoting various stages of World Government (under which the U .S . would lose its national sovereignty) All of the Establishment's anti-American plans, proposals and programs can be defeated if the American people are informed and aware of this threat to the survival of this nation as a Constitution- al Republic ."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"CHAPTER I THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS Its Views On Foreign Policy The most prominent and most powerful of the organizations com- posing the Establishment is the Council on Foreign Relations . Ac- cording to THE DAN SMOOT REPORT* of July 17, 1961 : The Council on Foreign Relations is the invisible government of the United States by virtue of the fact that members of the Coun- cil occupy key posts in the Executive branch of Government from the presidency downward . By its own efforts, and through many interlocking organizations, the Council on Foreign Relations also virtually controls public opinion in the United States . Richard H . Rovere, writing in the May, 1962, issue of ESQUIRE, corroborates Mr . Smoot's statement, as follows : The directors of the Council on Foreign Relations make up a sort of Presidium for that part of the Establishment that guides our destiny as a nation . So dominant has become the influence of the Council on Fo- reign Relations that it has almost taken over the prescribed ac- tivities of the U .S . State Department . By managing to place its members in key positions in the State Department, the CFR has, in essence, become a super-governing hierarchy, not subject to the control of Congress or the American people . What are the views being advocated by the Council on Foreign Relations which exerts such a Machiavellian influence on the poli- cies of the government of the United States ?

These foreign policy recommendations totaled 1431 fine-print pages . The Foreign Policy Clearing House, a \"non-partisan\" private organization, made a summary of these foreign policy recommendations which were published by Fred- erick A . Praeger, Inc ., under the title of \"Strategy for the 60's .\"* The book carries the imprimatur of Senator J . W . Fulbright, Chair- man of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and apparently Sen- ate spokesmen for the Council on Foreign Relations . Senator Ful- bright, it will be recalled, gained notoriety in 1961 because of his semi-secret document, the so-called Fulbright Memorandum, which urged the muzzling of the military who warn of the Communist threat . An indication of the views of the CFR's Fulbright is the following statement which was contained in the Fulbright Memorandum : In the long run it is quite possible that the principal problem of leadership will be, if it is not already, to restrain the desire of the (American) people to hit the Communists with everything we've got, particularly if there are more Cubas and Laoses . Pride in victory and frustration in restraint, during the Korean War, led to MacAr- thur's revolt and McCarthyism . In the internationalism-promoting book, \"Strategy for the 60's,\" are found a number of foreign policy recommendations, some of which are already in effect ; some soon to be carried out ; with Council on Foreign Relations members or aides in the State De- partment quietly working out final details for the all-out thrust of the United States Government into a Socialist, One-World order .

The inaccuracy of the above statement is incredible . It follows the Orwellian brainwashing technique of \"black is white ; peace is war ; slavery is freedom, etc .\" Further, the foregoing statement clearly shows the contempt in which members of the Establishment hold the intelligence of the American people . Today, thanks to the efforts of the growing anti-Communist movement within the United States, the showing of such films as \"Operation Abolition,\" \"Com- munism on the Map,\" and \"Communist Encirclement - 1961\" to thousands of groups throughout the country, many high school stu- dents are apparently more aware of the extent of Communist ag- gression than are the so-called foreign policy experts of the Coun- cil on Foreign Relations! The truth of the matter is, however, that the CFR is well aware of Communist gains since 1945 . The only reason for their totally erroneous statement regarding \"successfully resisting Communist expansion\" is to attempt to hide the true facts from the American people . In further refutation of the statement in the CFR's Study No . 7, consider the fact that at the time of the signing of the United Nations Charter in 1945, during the Truman Administration, 200 million peo- ple were behind the Iron Curtain . Today, 17 years later, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, more than 900 million people have been taken over by the Soviet Union . When the Eisenhower Administration took office in 1953, the fol- lowing nations were controlled by the Soviet Union : Albania, Bulgaria, Red China, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, North Korea, Outer Mongolia, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia . By 1961 the following additional nations had been completely taken over, or are now ruled by Soviet-directed dictators : Cuba, Hungary, North Vietnam and Tibet ."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"8 \t America's Unelected Rulers Further, either by way of Communist sympathizers who run the government, or highly successful Communist agitation, the Commu- nists have acquired almost complete control in the following coun- tries : Afghanistan, British Guiana, Cambodia, the Congo, Egypt,Ghana, Guinea, Iceland, Indonesia, Iraq, Laos, South Korea, Syria, Tuni- sia, Venezuela, and Yemen . CONSTITUTION : A DETERRENT TO INTERNATIONALIST AIMS The Council on Foreign Relations Study No . 7 complains that U .S . policy is \"deficient in long-range planning .\" They blame this \"de- ficiency\" on the \"U .S . Constitution's division of foreign policy re- sponsibility between the Executive and Legislative branches of gov- ernment, and the resultant tendency to tie policies and programs to the Procrustean inflexibility of the fiscal year .\" For the benefit of those readers who may not have a dictionary handy, and may not be (or wish to be) too familiar with \"egghead- ese,\" we have just consulted Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary and find that the world \"Procrustean\" means \"harsh or inflexible in fitting (someone or something) to a pre-conceived idea, system, etc .\" The CFR study is correct in its use of the word \"Procrustean\" in describing the U .S . Constitution . The U .S . Constitution was in- tended to be \"inflexible\" in preserving the individual rights of the citizens of this nation . The Divinely-inspired Constitution of the United States of America was conceived and ratified by men who had long suffered under tyranny . The purpose of the Constitution was to protect the people from tyrannical practices and policies of their own government . In the famous preamble to our Constitution \"We, the People of the United States\" proclaimed to the world that our gov- ernment belongs to the people and is run by the people . Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution contains possibly its most restrictive sentence, which is as follows : All legislative powers herein shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Repre- sentatives . Note the use of the word \"all .\" It is this portion of the Consti-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The CFR's Views on Foreign Policy \t 9 tution which is hampering the efforts of the Internationalists in the State Department to take over legislative processes in order to im- plement their programs and concentrate all power in the Executive branch . Such a political philosophy is contrary to the spirit and wording of the United States Constitution . Beginning with Article I, Section 8, Clause 1, and ending with the final clause in Article I, the Constitution devotes itself to outlining the powers and functions of Congress, beginning with the phrase \"The Congress shall have power to . . .\" In order to prevent a power-grab by the Executive Department, headed by the President, the framers of the Constitution laid out and clearly defined in Article II the limited power of the Executive branch . Tyrannical dictatorship can never fasten itself upon the United States as long as the U .S . Constitution stands intact . That is why those who would subvert our Constituton, complain, as the CFR study puts it, about \"the Constitution's division of foreign po- licy responsibility between the Executive and Legislative branches of government .\" BUILDING A \"NEW INTERNATIONAL ORDER\" Under the section entitled \"The Foreign Policy Tasks Which Lie Ahead,\" the Council on Foreign Relations Study No . 7 lists as the first task : Building a new international order . The CFR Study No . 7 then states that freedom of nations is re- cognized as \"interdependent,\" and adds that such a new inter- national order should also include states \"labeling themselves as Socialist .\" In all international organizations to which the United States pre- sently belongs, such as the United Nations and NATO, the United States has only one vote . The CFR's proposal to \"build a new in- ternational order\" would therefore place the United States in an international World Government with Socialist states which would, of course, outnumber the United States . Thus governmental policy"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"10 \t America's Unelected Rulers of the United States would be determined by Socialist nations over- seas . REGIONAL ARRANGEMENTS The second and third points which the Council on Foreign Rela- tions study recommends are : Safeguard U .S . security through . . .regional arrangements . . . Maintain and gradually increase the authority of the United Nations . The American people have been deliberately deceived regarding these so-called regional arrangements . For example, we are told that NATO is a \"shield\" against Communist aggression . This, however, is refuted by the fact that although NATO is supposed to be a regional organization composed of Free World nations opposed to Communism, NATO is actually under the control of the Soviet- dominated United Nations . Article 53 of the U .N . Charter states that no regional organization can take any enforcement action (as a deterrent against aggression) \"without the authorization of the (U .N .) Security Council . . .\" Article 54 of the U .N . Charter states that the U .N . Security Coun- cil \"shall at all times be kept fully informed of activities under- taken . . . by regional agencies . . .\" (such as NATO) . The Soviet Union, a member of the all powerful Security Council, exercises veto power . The simple question then arises - - how could it be possible to \"safeguard U .S . security\" through \"regional arrangements,\" such as the CFR study proposes, when the regional arrangements them- selves are under the domination of the only force that threatens Am- erican security -- namely, the Soviet Union? (Regional arrange- ments such as NATO, and also United States involvement in the United Nations, will be discussed at length in a later chapter) . U .S . UNDER WORLD COURT Point four of the Council on Foreign Relation Study No . 7 is : Make more effective use of the International Court of Justice, ju- risdiction of which should be increased by withdrawal of reservations by member nations on matters judged to be domestic ."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The CFR's Views on Foreign Policy \t 11 What this seemingly innocuous proposal urges is the repeal of the Connally Amendment, which states that the International Court of Justice, or World Court, shall not have jurisdiction in \"matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the United States, as determined by the United States .\" What is the World Court? All World Court judges are nominated by governments which are members of the United Nations . There are no uniform United Nations qualifications for World Court judges . Not even a legal degree is required . The World Court is composed of 15 judges . No nation may have more than one judge . Thus the United States is outnumbered 14 to 1 on the World Court, with the Court being composed of a representative of the Soviet Union plus one or more judges from Soviet satellite nations . Nine of these 15 judges make up a quorum, and the majority of a quorum (only 5) is enough for a decision from which there is no appeal . If the Connally reservation is repealed, as the Council on Foreign Rela- tions Study No . 7 urges, it would be possible for the Soviet Union, one of its satellites, and judges from three Soviet-leaning coun- tries to get together, form a quorum, and render judgments af- fecting domestic issues in the United States . In April, 1961, a Polish Communist by the name of Bohdan Ste- fan Winiarski was elected president of the U .N .'s International Court of Justice (World Court) by his fellow U .N . judges, including the U .S . representative, Philip C . Jessup, member of the Council on Foreign Relations . The term of office for this Communist pre- sident of the World Court ends in 1967 . As president of the World Court, Communist Winiarski wields great power . For example, all hearings are under the control of the president . All minutes of the hearings must be signed by this Communist president and a court registrar . A juggled word here and there, a few placed, or mis- placed, commas or periods -- since these court \"minutes\" set legal precedents -- could play havoc with the laws of the United States and other non-Communist countries . If the U .N . court deadlocks on a vote, its present Communist president, -Mr . Winiarski, will have two votes . In addition to his regular vote, he will have an extra vote, called a \"casting vote,\" in order to break the tie ."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"12 \t America's Unelected Rulers ATLANTIC COMMUNITY The Council on Foreign Relations study states : Promote the solidarity of the Atlantic Community . The name \"Atlantic Community,\" chosen apparently to connote a union of Free Western nations, is a misnomer, because the Coun- cil on Foreign Relations study also states : Prevent Atlantic Community solidarity from becoming (or seeming to become) a front against non-Western nations . Supposedly, the internationalists would wish to include Japan and certain African nations in the Atlantic Community, which would ac- count for the above recommendation . Tremendous efforts have gone into the establishment of the Atlantic Community with its high- sounding name, as a stepping-stone for dragging the United States into a \"new international order\" ; (which means a Socialist One- World government) . It would seem, therefore, that the Atlantic Com- munity is an integral part of this set-up, and will therefore be main- tained and implemented even though the name of the organization ap- pears to be slightly restrictive . (The Atlantic Community will be discussed at length in a later chapter .) LONG-TERM FOREIGN AID Another recommendation made by the Council on Foreign Rela- tions Study No . 7, is : U .S . economic aid programs must be more ambitious, longer- term, and aimed at specific areas and tasks . Originally the Foreign Aid program was sold to the American people under the pretext of \"preserving the Free World against World Communism .\" However, this phony line was exposed when it was revealed that during the period from July 1, 1945 to June 30, 1957, over $2-1/2 billion U .S . taxpayer dollars were sent to Commu- nist or Communist-dominated countries, such as Albania, Czecho-"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The CFR's Views on Foreign Policy \t 13 slovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia .* Further, more than $300 million in U .S . Foreign Aid was used to defeat the anti-Communist forces in Indonesia . Tito of Yugosla- via, who frequently pledges his loyalty to the Soviet Union, now has the fifth largest air force in the world, an air force that can be used against the Free World -- an air force that was financed by U .S . Foreign Aid . Now that the deception of Foreign Aid being used to fight Com- munism has been exposed, the Foreign Aid promotors have switched to a new line, which is, according to the Council on Foreign Re- lations Study No . 7, to \"assist the less-developed areas through- out the world .\" This new foreign policy switch, strangely, follows an instruction from the late Joseph Stalin, dictator of the Soviet Union, who stated in \"Marxism and The National Colonial Ques- tion,\" (pages 115-116) : It is essential that the advanced countries should render aid -- real and prolonged aid -- to the backward countries in their cultu- ral and economic development . Otherwise it will be impossible to bring about peaceful coexistence of the various nations and peoples -- within a single economic system, which is so essential for the final triumph of Socialism . It should be noted that when Stalin used the world \"Socialism\" he actually means Communism, inasmuch as in Communist jar- gon, the words \"Socialism\" and \"Communism\" are interchange- able . MILITARY FOREIGN AID In an attempt to lead the American people to think that their tax dollars are being used to arm friendly nations, the Council on Foreign Relations Study No . 7 recommends : A long-range global military aid program to strengthen U .S . and allied defenses .

(Emphasis theirs) In other words, the CFR recommends that U .S . tax dollars be used in Foreign Aid to help and arm both friendly and unfriendly nations, without requiring any pledge of support from the re- cipient nations . UNDERCOVER DEALING WITH RED CHINA Another example of the devious policies promoted by the Coun- cil on Foreign Relations is its recommendation regarding Commu- nist China, as follows : Channels must exist to communicate with the Communist regimes, including that of Communist China . \"Ingeneralthe most promising channels for communication with the Soviet Union and Communist China will be regular or ad hoc contacts maintaining the necessary conditions of true negotiation, which may at times be at the high- est level, but not public performances of ministers or heads of go- vernment .\"* In other words, the Council on Foreign Relations recommends that \"regular or ad hoc contacts,\" such as experts furnished by the Council on Foreign Relations, or citizen committees made up of CFR members, or CFR members in high places in the State De- partment should \"maintain the necessary conditions of true ne- gotiation .\" This could mean a recommendation to acquiesce to Soviet demands . Another sinister aspect of this CFR recommen- dation is the phrase \"not public performances of ministers or heads of government .\" In simple language this means the CFR recommends secret agreements, secretly arrived at . Constitutional experts are, for the most part, agreed that one loophole in the U .S . Constitution is Article VI, Clause 2, which states : This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be * The quoted matter is taken from the original, lengthy CFR report ."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The CFR's Views on Foreign Policy \t 15 made, under authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land . . . The framers of the Constitution never envisaged that the day would come when men in high places would wish to negotiate away the rights and privileges of the people of the United States . It is obvious that in recommending such secret negotiations, the Coun- cil on Foreign Relations Study No . 7 recognizes this Constitution- al loophole, and plans to exploit it to the ultimate destruction of the U .S . Constitution itself . DISARMAMENT The Council on Foreign Relations Study No . 7 recommends that the U .S . : (a) Fully explore Soviet proposals for complete or partial disar- mament ; (b) Concentrate more on developing our own disarmament propo- sals ; (c) Negotiate on these proposals, perhaps directlywith the USSR in secret . . . (d) Negotiate in the framework of the United Nations . Here, indeed, is proof positive that the Council on Foreign Re- lations proposes to conduct negotiations \"in secret\" with the USSR . As for negotiating within the framework of the U .N ., which the CFR recommends, this would put all negotiations directly under the control of the Soviet Union, which now not only controls the United Nations, but also exercises veto power in the Security Coun- cil . RED RECORD OF BROKEN TREATIES Of what value would any disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union be when Khrushchev has stated that promises are \"like pie crusts -- made to be broken\" 7 Regarding the Soviet Union's record of treaty-breaking, Senate Document No . 85 (1955), en- titled \"Soviet Political Treaties and Violations\" states : The staff (of the Subcommittee on Internal Security) studied near- ly a thousand treaties and agreements . . .both bilateral and multi- lateral, which the Soviets have entered into, not only with the United"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"15 \t America's Unelected Rulers States, but with countries all over the world . The staff found that in the 38 short years since the Soviet Union came into existence, its Government had broken its word to virtually every country to which it ever gave a signed promise . The Council on Foreign Relations is well aware of the Soviet re- cord of treaty-breaking . They know that in view of this record, the Soviet Union could not be expected to live up to any disarmament program ; and yet the Council on Foreign Relations insists on pro- moting disarmament of the United States in the face of Soviet ag- gression, the latest example of which is the establishment of a Soviet satellite, Cuba, only 90 miles from America's shores . \"FRONTS\" OF THE ESTABLISHMENT In his article in the May, 1962, issue of ESQUIRE, Richard H . Rovere states that the Establishment \"is a coalition of forces, the leaders of which form the top directorate, or Executive Committee, referred to sometimes as `Central .' At the lower level organi- zation is quite loose, almost primitive in some cases . . .\" Both the DAN SMOOT REPORT and Richard Rovere are agreed that the Council on Foreign Relations furnishes the top leadership for the Establishment . One of the organizations in the \"coalition of forces\" is the Cen- ter for International Affairs at Harvard University . In the book previously mentioned, entitled \"Strategy for the 60's,\" with an in- troduction by Senator Fulbright, appears Study No . 10 which is based on a report by the Center for International Affairs at Harvard . Several noteworthy points, which can be assumed to represent E s- tablishment thinking, emerge from Study No . 10 by the Center for International Affairs at Harvard . THE ESTABLISHMENT'S VIEWS ON NATIONALISM Here is the definition of nationalism as contained in Study No . 10 : Nationalism is the assertion by a people of its claim to a distinc- tive national identity, entitling it to live its own life in its own fashion ."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The CFR's Views on Foreign Policy \t 17 To the above statement we have no disagreement . Study No . 10, further discussing Nationalism, then states : Nationalism seldom yields positive doctrine, beyond the demand for a sovereign state, independent of alien overlords . The question immediately comes to mind --what more \"positive\" doctrine is needed than that of a sovereign state independent of alien overlords ? And then Study No . 10 makes two interesting admissions . The Harvard Study laments that Nationalism \"tends to be `anti' in cha- racter,\" and goes on to say that : While based on mass support, it is not necessarily democratic . How these two puerile statements ever found their way into a supposedly learned Harvard study is hard to understand . Of course, Nationalism is \"anti\" anything and anybody who menaces the na- tional sovereignty of its state! Of course, it is \"anti\" alien over- lords or alien dictators over its native land! And then that amazing contradiction that Nationalism, though based on mass support, is not democratic! Comment would appear to be unnecessary . But the dichotomy continues, because two sections later, the Harvard study admits : Nationalism does, however, have much to contribute to the de- velopment of new countries, by (a) providing a sense of social and political solidarity ; and (b) injecting dynamism and political acti- vism into the society . In other words, the intellectual pundits of Harvard are perfectly willing to foster and permit nationalism among cannibals in Africa, but would deny and downgrade the spirit of Natiorralism among the citizens of the United States of America! Study No . 10 of the Center for International Affairs of Harvard University states : The West's primary interest is NOT in maintaining the status quo and supporting entrenched domestic interests which oppose necessary social change . (Emphasis theirs) Thus it would appear that the Harvard experts feel no compunction in recommending programs and policies which would disastrously affect the domestic economy of the United States . The Kennedy Ad- ministration's Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which admits that a"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"18 \t America's Unelected Rulers number of U .S . industries will be grievously hurt by wiping out tariffs, is an example of this anti-U .S . industry attitude on the part of the Internationalist experts . \"The necessary social change\" referred to inStudyNo . 10 is for the purpose of furthering \"the psychological unification of the world .\" The Harvard Study also states : Internationalism today is a corrective . . . for nation-states . It is a remedy against the dangers arising when states are left to their own devices, and a cure for the deficiencies states experience when isolated . When the United States of America was \"leftto its own devices,\" and operated with strict adherence to the spirit and law of the U .S . Constitution, the United States became the most powerful and most respected nation on earth . Today, after several decades of inter- nationalist-oriented foreign policy, and the squandering of over $100 billion in Foreign Aid overseas, the United States has a national debt higher than the combined national debts of all other nations in the world . Further, the billions wasted overseas in Foreign Aid have not guaranteed that a single ally would stand by our side in the case of Soviet aggression . The United States flag is burned and spat upon in foreign capitals of the world . Americans overseas are assaulted or murdered with little or no protest from our government . The Establishment -- notably, the Council on Foreign Relations -- through effective infiltration by its members into the U .S . State Department, has played a key role in reducing the United States to its present situation ."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II INTERLOCK BETWEEN GIANT TAX-FREE FOUNDATIONS AND THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS The documentation contained in this chapter is based on the report entitled \"Tax Exempt Foundations\" of the Special Committee to In- vestigate Tax-Exempt Foundations and Comparable Organizations, House of Representatives, 83rd Congress, which was submitted to the Committee of the Whole House on December 16,1954 . The abbrevia- ted name for this investigating committee, which was headed by the late Congressman Carroll B . Reece of Tennessee, is the \"Reece Committee .\" As stated before, the top leadership and policy-making functions of the Establishment are furnished by the Council on Foreign Rela- tions . Who finances the Council on Foreign Relations ? With what other organizations and foundations is the Council on Foreign Rela- tions affiliated ? What is \"the interlock,\" and what accounts for the Socialist-Internationalist bias of the interlock? The term \"foundation\" is a broad one . In the Reece Committee report this term is used to denote \"foundations\" as it is ordinarily used by the layman - - indicating such foundations as the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Ford Foundation, etc . In investigating these tax-free foundations, the Reece Committee decided to confine their inquiry chiefly to the activities of the foundations in what are known as the \"social sci- ences .\" The power of the individual large foundation is enormous . It can exercise various forms of patronage which carry with them elements of thought control . It can materially predetermine the development of social and political concepts with their resultant courses of ac- tion . This power to influence national policy is amplified tremen- dously when foundations act in concert . The far-reaching power of the large foundations and of \"the inter- lock\" (or working arrangements) between them, has so influenced 19"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"20 \t America's Unelected Rulers the press, the radio, and even the government that it has become ex- tremely difficult for objective criticism of foundation practices to get into news channels without having first been distorted, slanted, discredited, and, at times, ridiculed . The hearings and report of the Reece Committee on Tax-Exempt Foundations are now out of print . Because the documented testi- mony in the 1954 hearings have such an acute bearing on the foreign policy practices of the U .S . Government today, considerable space in this chapter will be given to a re-statement of the Committee findings, in order to bring this information to the widest number of present-day readers . House Resolution 217, adopted July 27, 1953, which created the Reece Committee, authorized an investigation to determine which foundations and organizations, exempt from Federal income taxa- tion, \" . . .are using their resources for un-American and subver- sive activities ; for political purposes ; propaganda, or attempts to influence legislation .\" THE INTERLOCK IN INTERNATIONALISM The Reece Committee Report states : Substantial evidence indicates there is more than a mere close working-together among some foundations operating in the inter- national field . There is here a close interlock . The Carnegie En- dowment for International Peace, the Rockefeller Foundation, and recently the Ford Foundation, joined by some others, have com- monly cross-financed to the tune of many millions various inter- mediate and agency organizations concerned with internation- alism, among them The Institute of Pacific Relations The Foreign Policy Association The Council on Foreign Relations and others That it (the interlock) happened by sheer coincidence stretches credulity . That such unity of purpose, effort, and direction re- sulted from chance or happenstance seems unlikely . Some of the larger foundations have had a significant impact upon our foreign policy, and have done much to condition the think- ing of our people along \"Internationalist\" lines . What is this In-"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Tax-Free Foundations and the CFR \t 21 ternationalism which meets with such hearty foundation support? Professor Kenneth Colegrove, in his testimony before the Reece Committee, stated : In my opinion, a great many of the staffs of the foundations have gone way beyond Wendell Willkie with reference to Internationalism and globalism . * * * There is undoubtedly too much money put into studies which support globalism and Internationalism . Former Assistant Secretary of State Spruille Braden stated in a letter to the Counsel for the Reece Committee, after he had testi- fied before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee : I have a very definite feeling that these various foundations very definitely do exercise both overt and covert influences on our for- eign relations, and that their influences are counter to the funda- mental principles on which this nation was founded and which made it great . The Rockefeller Foundation minced no words in its 1946 report (p .934, Reece Committee Hearings) : The challenge of the future is to make this world one world -- a world truly free to engage in common and constructive intel- lectual efforts that will serve the welfare of mankind everywhere . In commenting on the above statement of the Rockefeller Founda- tion Report, the Reece Committee Report said : However well-meaning the advocates of complete Internation- alism may be, they often play into the hands of the Communists . Communists recognize that a breakdown of Nationalism is a pre- requisite to the introduction of Communism . PREPARATION FOR WORLD CITIZENSHIP During the years 1925-1952, the Rockefeller Foundation gave $11,069,770 to the American Council of Learned Societies . In 1947, President Harry Truman appointed the Commission on Higher Education . The President of the American Council of Learned So- cieties was chairman of this Commission, which produced a report emphasizing that the domestic scene was to be changed by a con- certed effort on the part of the intellectual leaders of the nation so that the American people would be led toward world citizenship ."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"22 \t America's Unelected Rulers The report of the President's Commission on Higher Education con- tained this statement : In speed of transportation and communication, and in economic interdependence, the nations of the globe are already one world ; the task is to secure recognition and acceptance of this oneness in the thinking of the people, so that the concept of one world may be realized psychologically, socially, and, in good time, politically . It is this task in particular that challenges the scholars and teach- ers to lead the way toward a new way of thinking * * * * There is an urgent need for a program for world citizenship that can be made a part of every person's general education . SUBVERSIVE INFLUENCES IN THE FOUNDATIONS Page 41 of the Reece Committee Report states : It is a conclusion of this committee that the trustees of some of the major foundations have, on numerous important occasions, been beguiled by truly subversive influences . Without many of their trustees having the remotest idea of what has happened, these foundations have frequently been put substantially to uses which have adversely affected the best interests of the United States . In discussing Communist infiltration of the foundations, the Reece Committee Report states : The Cox Committee (which preceded the Reece Committee) record shows that a conscious plan by the Communists was inaugurated to infiltrate the foundations for the purpose of appropriating their funds to Communist uses . We know from the evidence that the Communists succeeded in the case of seven foundations : The Marshall Field Foundation ; the Garland Fund ; the John Simon Guggenheim Founda- tion ; the Heckscher Foundation ; the Robert Marshall Foundation ; the Rosenwald Fund ; and the Phelps-Stokes Fund ; and we are aware of the tragic result to our nation and to the world of Communist in- filtration into the Institute of Pacific Relations . We know also that (then undisclosed) Communists and their fellow travelers had been able to secure grants from other foundations, including Carnegie and Rockefeller . We know, further, what the Cox Committee referred to as \"the ugly unalterable fact that Alger Hiss * became the President * Alger Hiss was convicted and served a prison term for perjury for lying about his Communist affiliations and activities ."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Tax-Free Foundations and the CFR \t 23 of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace .\" We do not know the full extent to which there has been penetration or use of foundations and their resources . It is too much to assume that Com- munist success was limited to the exposed instances . Indeed, where foundations are involved in so high a concentration of power, we may assume that some advantage may have beentakenby Communists to use this interlock, directly or indirectly, for malign purposes .* Whether the penetration is by outright Communists, or by some other variety of Socialists or collectivists, the danger of its occurrence is far greater when there exists a complex of inter-related and interlocked organizations . There are more opportunities for shifting both personnel and grants . . . . After they have poured these funds into the managerial hands of others, the detailed distribution is be- yond their control . In 1952, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary stated : *' The Institute of Pacific Relations was a vehicle used by the Com- munists to orient American Far Eastern policies toward Commu- nist objectives . Members of the small core of officials and staff members who controlled IPR were either Communist or pro- Communist . . . It was the continued practice of the IPR to place in government positions both persons associated with IPR, and other persons selected by the effective leadership of IPR . . . The net result of IPR activities on United States public opinion has been such as to serve international Communist interests and to affect adversely the interests of the United States . According to the McCarran Committee, the Rockefeller Founda- tion should have known as early as the 1930's that the Institute of Pacific Relations had ceased to be a proper or even safe recipient of Foundation funds . And yet, as late as December 31, 1952, the Rockefeller Foundation, with Dean Rusk's ** approval, donated $50,000 to the IPR . * Institute of Pacific Relations - Report of the Committee on the Judiciary, 82nd Congress, pertaining to hearings held July, 1951- June, 1952, by the Se- nate Internal Security Subcommittee . ** Dean Rusk, who was then Chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation, was ap- pointed by President Kennedy as Secretary of State in 1961 ."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"24 \t America's Unelected Rulers FOUNDATIONS FEED PERSONNEL INTO GOVERNMENT Mr . Thomas McNiece, Assistant Research Director for the Reece Committee, described a \"central or mainstream of influence\" run- ning from the foundations and their centralized agencies into govern- ment . There was considerable evidence to show that the government had come to rely upon the foundation \"clearinghouses\" for lists of men to assist the specialists in the \"social sciences .\" In this con- nection, the Reece Committee Report stated : The political slant of these individuals may seriously affect the character of government operations . We have seen many Commu- nists and fellow-travelers recommended by foundation execu- tives for government posts . In the case of the recommendations to the government made by the Institute of Pacific Relations and the American Council of Learned Societies for experts to be used by our occupation forces in Germany and Japan, the lists were heavily salted with Communists and their supporters . And now, back to the Council on Foreign Relations, the power bloc of the Establishment, which by 1962 had, to all intents and purposes, taken over the formulation and implementation of U .S . foreign policy . According to the Hearings of the Reece Committee (page 894), the Rockefeller Foundation and its associated foundation, the Laura Spel- man Fund, contributed $1,320,700 to the Council on Foreign Rela- tions during the years 1927-1952 . The Reece Committee Report, on page 177, states : The Council on Foreign Relations came to be in essence an agency of the United States Government, no doubt carrying its interna- tionalist bias with it . When World War II broke out, it offered its assistance to the Secretary of State . As a result, under the Coun- cil's Committee on Studies, the Rockefeller Foundation initiated and financed certain studies on : Security and Armaments Pro- blems ; Economic and Financial Problems ; Political Problems ; and Territorial Problems . These were actually known as the War and Peace Studies . Later this project was actually taken over by the State Department itself, engaging the secretaries who had been serving with the Council on Foreign Relations groups . A fifth subject was added in 1942 through the \"Peace Aims Group .\" There was a precedent for this . The Carnegie Endowment had of- fered its services to the Government in both World War I and"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Tax-Free Foundations and the CFR \t 25 World War II . There was even an interlock in personnel in the person of Professor (James T .) Shotwell and many others, some of whom proceeded into executive and consultative office in the Government . There can be no doubt that much of the thinking in the State Department came from the personnel of the Carnegie Endowment and the Council on Foreign Relations . . . . The Carnegie Endowment in its 1934 Yearbook, proudly asserts that it -- \"is becoming an unofficial instrument of international policy, taking up here and there the ends and threads of inter- national problems and questions which the Government finds it difficult to handle, and, through private initiative, reaching con- clusions which are not of a formal nature, but which unoffi- cially find their way into the policies of governments .\" The report of Kathryn Casey, Legal Analyst for the Reece Com- mittee, clearly shows the interlock between the Rockefeller Foun- dation, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and some of their associated organizations, such as the Council on Foreign Re- lations, with the State Department . And then the Reece Committee report states : Indeed, these foundations and organizations would not dream of denying this interlock . They proudly note it in reports . They have : (a) undertaken vital research projects for the Department ; (b) virtually created minor departments or groups within the Department for it ; (c) supplied advisors and executives from their ranks ; (d) fed a constant stream of personnel into the State Depart- ment trained by themselves or under programs which they have financed ; and (e) have had much to do with the formulation of foreign policy both in principle and detail . They have, to a marked degree, acted as direct agents of the State Department . And they have engaged actively, and with the ex- penditure of enormous sums, in propagandizing (\"educating\" ? -- public opinion) in support of the policies which they have helped to formulate .

Before long, the Carnegie Foun- dation (and later, Ford) began to finance the Council . In 1929 the Council (largely with Rockefeller gifts) acquired its present head- quarters property, the Harold Pratt House, 58 E . 86th St ., New York City . In 1939 the Council began to take over the American State De- partment . The membership of the Council on Foreign Relations is restricted to 700 resident members, those whose residence or place of busi- ness is within 50 miles of City Hall, New York City, and 700 non- resident members who reside or do business outside that 50-mile radius .

In discussing the infiltration of the Council on Foreign Relations by Communists and Communist fronters, THE DAN SMOOT RE- PORT of June 19, 1961, stated : By 1941, the Council on Foreign Relations and the various founda- tions and other organizations interlocked with it had virtually taken over the American State Department, and had controlling influence over the Roosevelt Administration through powerful individuals stra- tegically placed in many of the agencies . Some Council on Foreign Relations individuals were later identified as Soviet espionage agents : for example, Alger Hiss, Harry Dexter White, Lauchlin Currie . Other Council on Foreign Relations members--Owen Latti- more, for instance -- with powerful influence in the Roosevelt and Truman Administrations, were subsequently identified, not as actual Communists, or Soviet espionage agents, but as \"conscious, articu- late instruments of the Soviet international conspiracy .\" I do not intend to imply by these citations that the Council on For- eign Relations is, or ever was a Communist organization . . . . The fact, however, that Communists, Soviet espionage agents, and pro- Communists could work inconspicuously for many years as influ- ential members of the Council indicates something very significant about the Council's objectives . The ultimate aim of the Council on Foreign Relations (however well-intentioned its prominent and powerful members may be) is the same as the ultimate aim of inter- national Communism : to create a One-World Socialist system, and make America a part of it .

It will be noted that in the key areas of Foreign Policy, Foreign Aid, Disarmament, Defense, Treasury, Labor, and Intelligence, the CFR holds the reins of power because of the appointment of their members to the policy-making posts . WHO ARE THE OTHER 96? As stated previously, the membership of the Council on Foreign Relations is restricted to 1400 . The 1960 Annual Report by the CFR, however, lists only 1304 members . QUESTION : Who are the other 96 unlisted members ? Former Vice President Richard M . Nixon, although not listed in the 1960 report, was invited to join the CFR in 1961 . There is, however, conflicting evidence as to whether or not President Ken- nedy is presently a member of the CFR . In the case of Kennedy, whether he is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations is immaterial, inasmuch as his foreign policy mirrors that of the CFR . The 1960 CFR Annual Report does not list Senator J .W . Fulbright . Again, as in the case of Kennedy, Fulbright possibly renders more yeoman service to the CFR than do some of the listed members . SIDELIGHTS ON CFR MEMBERS Below are random comments regarding background or public statements of certain CFR members in the Kennedy Administration, in order to give the reader an idea of the thinking of these indivi- duals : Dean Rusk, Secretary of State During the Korean War Mr .

Further, Mr . Rusk is said to have been in accord with the handcuffing and removal of one of the greatest Americans of all times, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, who desired to defeat the Red aggressors, in- sisting correctly that in war there is no substitute for victory . Also see Chapter II, in which it is documented that Dean Rusk ap- proved a Rockefeller Foundation contribution to the Institute of Pa- cific Relations after the IPR had been declared to be subversive . Edward R . Murrow, Director of U .S . Information Agency According to syndicated columnist Fulton Lewis, Jr . : (Edward R .) Murrow went all out to whitewash Dr . J . Robert Oppenheimer* who was denied security clearance by the Govern- ment after he admitted he had contributed financially to Commu- nist causes, and that both his brother and wife were deeply involved in Communist associations . Murrow's record goes on and on . In his time he defended such persons as Harry Dexter White (who was identified as a Soviet agent) . In 1935, the Soviet Russian Government itself disclosed that Mur- row was an active supporter of the Moscow State University Summer Session of 1935 . The Soviet aim at that time was to lure American teachers to this Moscow Summer School and to indoctrinate them in Communism . However, the Hearst papers, on February 18, 1935, exposed this Communist propaganda project, resulting in its aban- donment . August Heckscher and Pendleton Herring Two Council on Foreign Relations members wrote large segments of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund report of 1960 . They are August Heckscher, Director of the Twentieth Century Fund, and Pendleton Herring, President of the Social Science Research Council .

Rostow, both members of the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote a book entitled \"A Proposal : Key to an Effective Foreign Policy .\" In editorializing on the book, the NEW YORK DAILY NEWS states : Messrs . Millikan and Rostow are a pair of economics professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Their proposal is what you might call a plan for a watered-downSUNFED . SUNFED is the proposed special United Nations Fund for Economic Development -- to be managed mainly by Socialists and Communists from both sides of the Iron Curtain, and to deal out billions of dollars in helping underdeveloped countries . * * * * We're warned in the book that we must attach no strings to these loans or grants .

Our internal security measures -- all passed by Congress -- aren't tribal rights for us savages, they are our legiti- mate means of protection against the savage overthrow of our Re- public by force and violence . George Kennan In 1961, President Kennedy appointed George Kennan as U .S . Am- bassador to Yugoslavia . Mr . Kennan, who served as Ambassador to the Soviet Union, 1952-1953, is also a CFR member . An idea of the thinking of Ambassador Kennan is given in the following statement he made before the Women's National Democratic Club in Washington only about a year before the Kennedy election, where he concluded that : If you ask me whether such a country (the United States) has, over the long run, good chances of competing with a purposeful, serious and disciplined society such as that of the Soviet Union, I must say that the answer is no . In an article in the ATLANTIC MONTHLY, George Kennan advo- cated \"defending our homes\" only \"as well as we can in the direct sense\" but not by warning of retaliation if our homes should be des- troyed . And then Mr . Kennan concluded by stating in the ATLANTIC MONTHLY article : It will be said to me : \"This means defeat .\" To this I can only reply : \"I am skeptical of the meaning of victory and defeat in re- lation to modern war between great countries .\""},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IV THE BRAINWASHING DEPARTMENT OF THE CFR The CFR would not have achieved the pinnacle of power it now en- joys, and the increasing incorporation of its Liberal, Communist- appeasing recommendations into official U .S . Foreign Policy, had it not been for the fact that the CFR has been able to infiltrate the mass communications media of this nation . It is a strange quirk of human nature that if something appears in print, is heard on the radio, or is seen on television, it becomes, ipso facto, not only authentic, but readily credible to unthinking citizens . Capitalizing on this mental laziness - this failure to question or do one's own thinking - the big guns of the CFR-manipulated communi- cations media spout forth their propaganda barrage in support of the aims of the CFR . An indication of the extent of saturation in the field of communications is the following list of CFR members, according to the 1960 report of the Council . After each name is listed the po- sition occupied in 1962 by these CFR members . Bearing in mind the tremendous circulation of the publications represented, and the audi- ences reached by radio and TV networks which number in the millions, the total impact of CFR propaganda can be easily under- stood .

Shirer, author and news commentator ; Arthur Hays Sulzberger, Publisher and Chairman of the Board, NEW YORK TIMES ; John Hay Whitney, President and Publisher, NEW YORK HERALD TRIBUNE . In summary, it is seen that the Council on Foreign Relations is able to exert partial or maximum control on the editorial policies of the following principal organs of communication in this country : Co- lumbia Broadcasting System ; National Broadcasting System ; TIME Magazine ; LIFE Magazine ; LOOK Magazine ; NEWSWEEK Magazine ; THE NEW YORK TIMES ; and NEW YORK HERALD-TRIBUNE ; plus syndicated columnists controlled by the latter two newspapers . And, when occasionally a situation arises where the news com- mentators of NBC and CBS, and the CFR-captive newspapers and weekly magazines fail to drum up enough public support for CFR- recommended legislation, CFR member Elmo Roper can always be counted on to take a poll and come up with his findings that the Am- erican people \"support\" the proposed legislation, which legislation has resulted from CFR recommendations to the Government .

This is done under the auspices of an affiliation of the CFR known as"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"CFR' Brainwashing Department \t 39 the American Assembly . In the spring of 1962, the 21st American Assembly was held at Arden House according to an article by Sylvia Porter, syndicated financial columnist . The Executive Director of the American As- sembly is Henry M . Wriston, who is President of the Council on Foreign Relations . Arden House, a 50-room French Renaissance-style mansion lo- cated at Harriman, New York, was donated in 1951 to Columbia University by CFR member, W, Averell Harriman . With its lux- urious interior furnishings, and its elaborate gardens and sur- rounding park, Arden House is calculated to impress even its wealthiest visitors . Arden House is the scene of carefully planned six-week seminars for businessmen . At these seminars businessmen are \"briefed\" on the inner workings of government by so-called experts, parti- cularly in the area of Foreign Policy . Impressed by the physical trappings at Arden House, the erudition of the lecturing experts, and flattered at having been selected to be a part of such august company, the businessmen are highly susceptible to the Interna- tionalist theories propounded at these seminars . For example, one lecturer, billed as \"an authority on the real conditions inside Russia,\" will give an unchallenged report on mar- ket conditions expected within the next five years, provided the U .S . will \"wake up\" and do business with the Soviet Union and Red China . Another lecturer will moralize on the inevitability of Red China's admission to the U .N . and the necessity for U .S . cooperation to this end . Or, the subject may be the necessity for placing Foreign Aid on a permanent basis and under the control of the United Nations . Because open debate is frowned upon, and because of the highly touted authority of the experts in their particular fields, the lec- tures are accepted as dogmatic truth by the businessmen \"students\" at these American Assembly seminars . Alumni of Arden House form the nucleus of businessmen's groups who, under the skilful manip- ulation of policy-makers in the Council on Foreign Relations, draw up resolutions and recommendations concerning governmental po- licy .

The Council on Foreign Relations each year also holds a series of meetings of business executives . It is interesting to note whom their speakers have been in the past . Among those addressing CFR meetings in recent years have been Anastas I . Mikoyan, first de- puty premier of the Soviet Union ; Tom M'boya of Kenya, a follower of Jomo Kenyatta, leader of the murderous Mau Mau ; and Fidel Castro, Communist dictator of Cuba . According to the Annual Report of the Council on Foreign Rela- tions, 1960, the seminar theme in the fall of 1959 was \"The Soviet- America Balance : Trends and Prospects .\" Then, according to the Council's report : At the final meetings, Robert R . Bowie, Director of Harvard University's Center for International Relations, and formerly Assistant Secretary of State for Policy Planning, evaluated the prospects for MEANINGFUL NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE COMMUNIST BLOC AND THE WEST . (Emphasis ours) The theme chosen for the Spring, 1960, series of meetings was \"Problems of United States Foreign Economic Policy,\" at which \"United States relations with the European Common Market\" were discussed . This is a clear indication of the amount of pressure that the Council on Foreign Relations intends to put behind the move to make the United States a member of the European Common Market . (The Common Market will be discussed in detail in a later chapter .) It is perhaps noteworthy that Governor Nelson Rockefeller was a speaker at the May 24, 1960, dinner-meeting of the Council on For- eign Relations .

Smoot then continued : Washington warned against foreign influence in the shaping of na- tional affairs . He urged America to avoid permanent entangling alliances with other nations, recommending a national policy of be- nign neutrality toward the rest of the world . Washington did not want America to build a wall around herself, or to become, in any sense, a hermit nation . Washington's policy permitted freer ex- change of travel, commerce, ideas, and culture between Americans and other people than Americans have ever enjoyed since the policy was abandoned . The Father of our Country wanted the American GOVERNMENT to be kept out of the wars and revolutions and po- litical affairs of other nations . In short, Washington told Americans that their nation had a high destiny, which it could not fulfil if they permitted their government to become entangled in the affairs of other nations . This book is not intended to be a chronological history of foreign alliances into which the United States has entered contrary to the advice of George Washington .

We do not propose to discuss in detail the United Nations, where the United States, because of the admission of newly-created Afri- can nations, is now out-voted by the Communist bloc . The U .N . has not only failed to maintain peace, but has now become a smokescreen for Soviet aggression throughout the world . Also, the U .N . itself be- came the aggressor in the U .N . war against the independent nation of Katanga in the Congo . Instead, let us turn our attention to NATO, an international organ- ization about which a majority of the American people have been de- liberately misinformed, or are dangerously uninformed, regarding its true purpose . THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION Propaganda put out by promoters of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, spreads the two following misconceptions : (1) They attempt to give the impression that although the Com- munists may dominate the United Nations, NATO is a se- parate organization, having no connection with the U .N ., and (2) They claim that NATO is a military alliance of the Free World, the purpose of which is to defend the Free World against Soviet aggression . Before refuting the above two claims by the NATO propagandists, here is some brief background on the North Atlantic Treaty Organ- ization . The North Atlantic Treaty setting up NATO was signed in Wash- ington, D .C ., on April 4, 1949, by the United States, Canada, and ten nations of Western Europe : Belgium, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and the United Kingdom . Greece and Turkey became members in February, 1952, and the Federal Republic of Germany joined in May, 1955, thus making a total of 15 nations as of 1962 . Paris is the headquarters for NATO . The North Atlantic Treaty itself mentioned only one permanent organ -- a council (the North Atlantic Council) -- and its powers"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"44 \t America's Unelected Rulers were unspecified . By purposely not specifying the powers of the North Atlantic Council, ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty by the U .S . Senate was facilitated . Had specific powers been delineated for the North Atlantic Council, sufficient suspicion mighthave been aroused to have prevented ratification . NATO - A SHIELD AGAINST COMMUNISM? The Nato Handbook, published in 1961, gives in its first chapter a reason for the establishment of NATO, as follows : In view of the strength of the Soviet Union, the balance could only be restored in favor of the West by an alliance of the free countries of Europe with the two North American powers, the United States and Canada . The Atlantic Congress, held in London June 5-10, 1959, was at- tended by 650 citizens from every NATO country except Iceland . A report adopted by the Atlantic Congress at the Plenary Session on June 9, states : If we are to survive, we are faced by the necessity of opposing the Communist world . Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty states : The parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or America shall be considered an attack against them all ; and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them . . . will assist the party or parties so at- tacked by taking . . . such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force . . . NATO UNDER CONTROL OF U .N . The above examples of the so-called anti-Communist purpose of NATO are what is fed to the American public via the communications media controlled by the Council on Foreign Relations . Below is what the American public is NOT told . Article 51 of the United Nations Charter seemingly permits mem-"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Entangling Alliances \t 45 ber nations to defend themselves against aggression by stating : Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense, if an armed attack occurs against a member of the organization . . . But the UN Charter very carefully qualifies this permission to member nations to defend themselves against aggression by then stipulating, in Article 51, that an attacked nation may defend itself . . . until the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to maintain international peace and security . In Article 51, the United Nations Charter further exercises its control over the national ability of any individual member nation : Measures taken by members in the exercise of this right of self- defense shall be immediately reported to the Security Council . . . Article 53 of the UN Charter permits member nations to form re- gional arrangements, presumably for defense . But again the UN qualifies how such defense action may be taken because Article 53 of the UN Charter says : . . . .No enforcement action shall be taken under regional arrange- ments or by regional agencies without the authorization of the Se- curity Council . . . Article 54 of the UN Charter then stipulates the conditions under which such regional arrangements may operate : The Security Council shall at all times be kept fully informed of the activities undertaken or in contemplation under regional ar- rangements or by regional agencies for the maintenance of inter- national peace and security . And what is this Security Council which is given the power in the UN Charter to decide whether or not a nation can defend itself against aggression? What is this Security Council to which all \"re- gional arrangements,\" such as NATO, must report concerning their activities ? The Security Council is the United Nations Security Council . Its members include the United States, Great Britain, France, Nation- alist China, and Communist Russia .

In other words, a simple veto by the Soviet member of the UN Security Council could deny a NATO nation the right of self-defense . Even though the Internationalists promote NATO as a \"shield\" against Communist aggression, those who drew up and signed the North Atlantic Treaty which established NATO did not actually in- tend NATO to be an effective counter-force to Soviet aggression, because the Preamble of the North Atlantic Treaty reads : The parties to this treaty reaffirm their faith in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations . . . Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, in discussing action to be taken by members in the event of attack, states : Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the (UN) Security Council . In other words, the framers of the NATO Treaty recognized that NATO is a mere \"creature\" of the Communist-dominated United Nations . Article 7 of the NATO Treaty states : This treaty does not affect . . . (the) obligations under the Charter of the parties which are members of the United Nations, or the pri- mary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security . Again it is seen that although NATO purports to have been estab- lished in order to defend the free world, it is admitted in the NATO Treaty that NATO is subservient to the Security Council of the United Nations, and that the UN Security Council has \"the primary respon- sibility\" for maintaining peace . And who composes the staff of this Security Council to whom NATO must report? A list furnished by the U .S . Mission to the UN proves that the Assistant Secretary for Security Council Affairs since April, 1949 to the present time has always been a Communist . Below are the names and terms of office of these Communists holding a key position on the UN Security Council which, in essence, holds the reins of control and power over any action taken by NATO : (1) Arkady A .

NATO MEMBERS TRADE WITH REDS Another illustration of the hypocrisy of NATO is that while pre- tending to be anti-Communist, NATO members are actually engag- ing in a very lucrative trade with the Soviet Union and its satellites . A special House investigating committee headed by Representative Paul Kitchin, in a probe initiated in 1961, states : Since January, 1960, and through June, 1961, massive procure- ments of plants and equipment embodying new Western technology have been made by the Soviet bloc . For example, the Kitchin report reveals that Great Britain has shipped the following types of potential war materiel behind the Iron Curtain : Electrical equipment for jet aircraft ; 100 all-purpose digital computers used in automation and telemetering of missiles ; a com- plete hydro-power station ; 2 mass spectrometers for use in nuclear and electronic research ; precision missile instruments ; etc . The Kitchin report also goes on to state how West Germany, Italy, Greece, and the Netherlands, all members of NATO, have exported the following strategic materials behind the Iron Curtain : Diesel engines ; control instruments for chemical plants ; 3 - 40,000-ton tankers ; 6,000 - horsepower air-conditioning systems for"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"48 \t\t America's Unelected Rulers Russian missile plants .

Amplifying on the false front of defense that NATO presents, Sen- ator Russell Long of Louisiana stated in addressing the Young Men's Business Club of New Orleans, December 15, 1960 : Many of you here probably do not realize that none of the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) countries are obligated to go to war if Russia should attack the United States .

And then Senator Jenner made the amazing statement that We cannot even find out what is going on . A five-year report on NATO was compiled in November, 1954 . When, a few days ago, I asked for later information, I was told it was classified . That means -- for executive agencies only . NATO government agencies recom- mend policies on taxes, inflation, arms production and economics . What their recommendations are, we in Congress do not know -- they are \"classified .\" The greatest stumbling block, actually the only deterrent to the final establishment of a Socialist-dominated One World Government, is the desire of the individuals of each nation to retain and protect the national sovereignty of their own country . Only in this way can a nation continue to be ruled by a government of its own choosing, in- stead of by a council of \"alien overlords .\" Although great secrecy was attached to the undercover planning operations of NATO during the period mentioned by Senator Jenner, in 1957 Republican Presi- dent Dwight Eisenhower (a member of the Council on Foreign Rela- tions) gave the signal that NATO's real plans were reaching a first stage of completion, and therefore secrecy wraps could be removed . On October 26, 1957, President Eisenhower and Prime Minister Macmillan of England issued a joint statement in which they de- clared : The concept of national sovereignty is now out of date .

The North Atlantic Council (the only permanent organ created by the North Atlantic Treaty) has remained the central policy organ, having ju- risdiction over the political, economic, and military aspects of the alliance . Under it, however, an initially unplanned civilian central structure has arisen, with coordinating functions far exceeding those of any other regional or universal international organization . A Council of Permanent Representatives of the member governments is in continuous session to workout details of joint policy or submit suggestions to the Council . It is assisted by a series of technical committees, staffed in part by governmental delegates and in part by members of the NATO Secretariat WHO TAKE DIRECTIONS FROM NO SINGLE GOVERNMENT .

Despite fifteen years since its formation in 1947, the UWF was able to circulate only \"115,000 pieces of information and education literature\" in 1961, according to its own report . On the other hand, during the same year, patriotic organizations throughout the country printed and distributed millions of pieces of literature in defense of the U .S .

Although the Council on Foreign Relations permitted two of its members to be associated with the United World Federalists in order to maintain an observer position, it is apparent now that the full force, finances, and influence of the Council on Foreign Relations for some years have been behind the Atlantic Union idea, originally spearheaded by Clarence Streit .

In the November, 1961, issue of the same magazine, Cla- rence Streit goes on at length on his thesis of \"citizen sovereignty .\" States Mr . Streit : Before a federation could be made by the people of the Atlantic nations in peacetime, there would have to be a profound moral re- volution among them, particularly in the stronger ones . They must not merely overthrow the principle of unlimited national sove- reignty, which now has such a stranglehold on them, but replace it with the opposite principle of citizen sovereignty . . . . (Atlantic) Union means that they have put the Rights of Man above the Rights of Nations . . . Mr . Streit then employs the weird logic that by placing the Rights of Man above the Rights of Nations, citizens would then, as he puts it, \"increase their own power over their government and lessen its power to interfere with their individual lives .\" The illogic of the above philosophy of Atlantic Union is appalling . Any so-called rights given by an all-powerful government to its ci- tizens can be withdrawn in the instant it takes to sign a governmental edict! Clarence Streit's psychotic desire to remake the world to suit his views would be unworthy of public notice had his proposals not fitted neatly into the recommendations of the Council on Foreign Relations \"to build anew international order,\" and \"promote the solidarity of the Atlantic Community .\"* The creation of an Atlantic Community peopled by Atlanticans must indeed be taken seriously in view of the fact, as we have mentioned, that the Atlantic Community idea is backed up by the millions of dollars at the disposal of the Council on Foreign Relations, via the giant tax-free foundations .

The North Atlantic Treaty establishing NATO was lobbied through the Senate in 1949 by the Atlantic Union Committee, which was granted tax-exempt status retroactive to its birth, even though it was admittedly established for the purpose of lobbying for Atlantic Union proposals . In testimony before a Senatorial committee in 1955, Associate Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan, who denied that he was a member of the Atlantic Union Committee, summarized the declared objectives of Atlantic Union as follows : . . .to drive the United States into a political union with a number of European and other foreign countries with common citizenship, common foreign policy and defense establishment, unified currency, economic integration, and unrestricted immigration .

The Convention for which it calls would explore the possibilities of a political, economic and military union among the democracies in the Atlantic area . The first Atlantic Union resolution was introduced in Congress in 1949 . It was reintroduced in succeeding years but failed to win Con- gressional approval . In 1955 and 1956, this resolution (Senate Con- current Resolution 12) was discussed extensively in hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which hearings were pub- lished in two parts entitled \"Relating to the Calling of an Atlantic Exploratory Convention .\" The revised draft of S .

That the President is requested to transmit to the other demo- cracies which sponsored the North Atlantic Treaty the proposal of the Congress that they name delegates to meet in a convention with delegates from the United States and from such other democracies, wherever situated, as the convention may invite, to explore and to report to what extent their people might, within the framework of the United Nations . . . achieve more effective and democratic unity in advancing their common economic, and political af- fairs . . . 2 .

Streit was only too willing to accept any modification of the re- solution, just as long as it was passed by Congress, and he empha- sized the point that the Atlantic Union Committee would welcome any amendments which \"assure that the convention shall be a convention of private citizens, rather than a diplomatic conference .\" And then Mr .

Therefore it is seen that although Congress did not pass any le- gislation calling for an Atlantic Exploratory Convention, neverthe- less exploratory talks were being carried on regarding an Atlantic Convention by NATO Parliamentarians' Conferences, as well as at the diplomatic, or State Department level . One of the favorite stratagems of the Liberal-Socialist-Interna- tionalists is to go ahead on a plan or program for which they have not previously received Congressional approval, or for which Congress has specifically refused to grant official approval, all the while as- serting that they are acting \"unofficially .\" NATO PARLIAMENTARIANS SET UP ATLANTIC CONVENTION After receiving Congressional authority for a delegation of Mem- bers of Congress to meet with parliamentary groups of North At- lantic area countries, the NATO Parliamentarians held a series of conferences, all with an aim to eventually setting up an Atlantic Convention of private citizens even though Congress had given no such authorization . The first move in this direction was made by the Third NATO Par- liamentarians Conference . A resolution unanimously adopted on No- vember 16, 1957, instructed the NATO Parliamentarians' Standing Committee and Political Committee to arrange for a conference to be known as the Atlantic Congress, which was scheduled to be held in London in June, 1959 .

This was a deliberate by-pass of the U .S . Congress . The bringing together of these private citizens in 1959, under the auspices of the Atlantic Congress, was to implement and add authenticity to the recommenda- tion of the Third NATO Parliamentarians' Conference of 1957 calling for a conference composed of leading representative citizens of NATO countries to seek greater \"unity of purpose\" within the At- lantic Community . The 650 private citizens of NATO countries which assembled at the Atlantic Congress in London in 1959 also passed a unanimous resolution to bring about \"not later than Spring of 1960, a special conference composed of not more than 100 leading representative citizens, directed to convene . . . and to recommend . . . the means by which greater cooperation and unity may best be developed within the Atlantic Community .\" An indication of the control exerted on the Atlantic Congress by the Council on Foreign Relations is the fact that the following CFR members are listed* as members of the Board of Directors of the U .S .

Thus it is seen that the NATO Parliamentarians arbitrarily set up a citizen group which rubber-stamped the NATO Parliamentarians' original resolution . The Parliamentarians then endorsed the reso- lution of the private citizen group . The net result of this compli- cated procedure was the fact that under the expert manipulation of the Atlantic Union and the Council on Foreign Relations, the U .S . Congress was presented with a \"fait accompli,\" i .e ., by 1960 there was actually functioning a private citizens' group, the Atlantic Con- gress, Inc ., closely cooperating with the NATO Parliamentarians for the purpose of setting up an Atlantic Convention . It will be recalled that the Atlantic Congress meeting in London in 1959 was composed of 650 private citizens . This was, of course, too large a group for practical purposes . This accounts for the fact that the recommendation of the Atlantic Congress urged that NATO countries officially appoint representatives to an Atlantic Community conference, the total number of private citizens not to exceed 100 . By early 1960, the CFR-Atlantic Union forces were ready for the final push for enabling legislation through both houses of Congress, in order to legalize their previous activities .

An indication of the scorn with which the hierarchy of NATO re- gard national sovereignty is a statement from the Atlantic Congress Report of June 5 - 10, 1959, prepared by the International Secre- tariat of the NATO Parliamentarians' Conference, which, as you will remember, was attended by 650 citizens from every NATO country except Iceland . Here is what can be considered NATO's view on national sovereignty : The traditional concept of the sovereignty of our countries must not be regarded as something unalterable, like Holy Writ . . . . Hence the need for us to accept limitations of the sovereignty of our states (nations), limitations which are urgently called for by the overriding needs of our . . . well-being and our unity . Because of the powerful pressure mobilized behind this bill, on August 24, 1960, the House of Representatives adopted S .J .Res . 170, which the U .S . Senate had passed June 15 . Thus was officially creat- ed the United States Citizens Commission on NATO to participate with their counterparts in other nations in an international conven- tion of representative citizens to examine how \"greater political and economic cooperation\" among their peoples might be promoted . On September 7, 1960, S .J . 170 became Public Law 86-719, when it was signed by President Eisenhower . Needless to say, the Atlan- tic Union Committee exulted over this victory in which their mem- bers had played such a prominent part .

The United States, as a member of NATO, was represented by members of the United States Citizens Commission on NATO . An official pamphlet of the Atlantic Convention declared that The purpose of the Convention was to explore and recommend ways by which greater cooperation and unity of purpose may be developed to the end that democratic freedom may be promoted by economic and political means . Alexander Warden, a member of the United States Commission on NATO, in a statement reprinted in the CONGRESSICNAL RECORD of March 28, 1962, revealed the following sidelight of the Atlantic Con- vention : Who voiced an invocation? Nobody . Here was an unexpected im- passe . Christians and Moslems were sitting shoulder to shoulder . A standing moment of silence was the simple and sensible solution . Here, then, was a conference of men who had traveled thousands of miles to formulate a proposed policy which would affect the lives of millions of people, but who did not openly seek Divine guidance in their deliberations . In his statement, Mr . Warden also disclosed some behind-the-scenes activities at the Atlantic Convention : After the opening plenary sessions of the Convention, it was quite clear that there was a wide gap between two schools of thought . One favored plunging at once into a full-fledged Atlantic Union, complete with Charter, Constitution, Parliament, Judiciary, common cur- rency, and common foreign policy . The other wanted to go more slowly, fearing uproar at home over abandoning suddenly so much of the popular concept of national sovereignty . The target was the same ; the difference was in the timing . Mr . Warden then summed up the Declaration of Paris which re- 70"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Declaration of Paris \t 71 suited from the Atlantic Convention of NATO Nations . Stated Mr . Warden in his analysis : It declared for a true Atlantic Community in ten years, with the pattern for it to be spelled out in the next two years . Its resolu- tions were a blueprint for : (1) establishment of the nucleus of an executive authority on political, economic, military, and cultural matters, (2) legislative participation on questions of concern to the Atlantic Community, and (3) a NATO High Court of Justice for set- tling legal differences therein . Christian A . Herter, Co-Chairman of the United States Citizens Commission on NATO, and a member of the CFR, in addressing the Atlantic Convention on January 8 referred to the \"necessary com- pression of our sovereignty\" and also scornfully referred to \"ex- cessive insistence on complete and uncoordinated national freedom .\" His closing remarks urged his listeners to \"break this spell of the magic of unlimited national autonomy .\" Possibly the most ominous statement in Herter's address was the following : Our gathering here to prospect an international breakthrough evi- dences growing confidence in the effectiveness of private efforts to improve the governance of men . Mr . Herter thereby admits that the purpose of the previous twelve years of activity by the Atlantic Union promoters which culminated in the Atlantic Convention is to by-pass the U .S . Congress ; and to place into the hands of private-citizen \"experts\" the reins of con- trol over the American people . These private-citizen experts, un- elected by the people would be beyond the power of the people to re- move from office for policies which seek to subvert our Republic . Such un-Constitutional proposals would not need to be considered se- riously were they not backed up by the billions of tax-free dollars at the disposal of the giant foundations who, acting in concert, are the driving force behind the World Government scheme . WHAT DOES THE DECLARATION OF PARIS PROPOSE? The Preamble to the Declaration of Paris \"demands\" the creation of a true Atlantic Community which \"must extend to the political,"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"72 \t America's Unelected Rulers military, economic, moral, and cultural fields .\" Under the Summary of Recommendations, Item 2, is found a pro- posal to create as an indispensable feature of a true Atlantic Community a permanent High Council at the highest political level to concert and plan, and in agreed cases to decide, policy on matters of concern to the Community as a whole . . . . Note carefully that this \"permanent High Council\" of the Atlantic Community would have the power to \"decide policy' Ion matters af- fecting members of the community . Clearly this would set the High Council above both the U .S . Senate and the House of Representatives so that, in effect, the Atlantic Community High Council could negate any action taken by our Congress which did not conform to the policy of the Atlantic Community . Or, for example, should the U .S . Con- gress refuse to legislate in certain fields the High Council could then \"decide policy\" in that area, policy which would affect the lives of American citizens, because presumably the United States would be a member of the Atlantic Community . This High Council would allow the American people no recourse regarding destructive edicts . Item 3 of Part 1 entitled \"Political and Economic Questions\" re- commends : the creation of a High Court of Justice, reserved to the Atlantic Community, in order to settle legal differences between members and between members and the organizations arising from the inter- pretation and application of treaties . Because of the loophole in the U .S . Constitution regarding treat- ies, such an Atlantic High Court of Justice could, through legal ma- neuvers, insinuate itself into the very fabric of law within the United States, superimposing its rulings and decrees over the rulings of the United States Supreme Court as well as lower Federal and State Courts . Section C, entitled \"Policies,\" under the heading \"Political and Economic Questions,\" states : The institutions of the Atlantic Community should harmonize those policies of its members affecting the interests of the Community as a"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Declaration of Paris \t 73 whole and contribute to the development of community methods in planning, considering and executing such policies . The word \"harmonize\" should be considered \"the mailed fist in the velvet glove,\" because in this case it means reducing all NATO nations to a common level, which, of course, would be lower than the standard-of-living level now enjoyed by citizens of the United States . \"Executing\" such policies of \"harmony\" means that suchharmony will be enforced . Any independent action by any nation in its own best interests could immediately be decreed as \"inharmonious\" with the \"interests of the community as a whole .\" This, of course, could be applied particularly to domestic matters . Worthy of note is a phrase appearing in Item 2 under \"Political and Economic Questions,\" which proposes that the NATO Parlia- mentarians' Conference which spearheaded the drive for the Atlan- tic Convention \"be developed into a consultative Atlantic Assembly, to meet at stated intervals . . . . a permanent secretariat and an annual budget should be provided for the Atlantic Assembly to in- sure continuity . Members of the Atlantic Assembly would be se- lected by member governments . . . They need not necessarily be parliamentarians .\" In other words, the NATO Parliamentarians' Conferences former- ly restricted only to members of legislative bodies of their respec- tive nations will open the door to unelected private citizens to be- come members of the Atlantic Assembly . In discussing foreign trade, the Declaration of Paris states : The Convention welcomes the spirit of President Kennedy's re- cent statement that a trade partnership should be formed between the United States and the European Economic Community (the Com- mon Market) * * * * with progressive reduction in tariffs and other barriers to trade . The Common Market, because it is such an integral part of the over-all plan to submerge the national sovereignty of the United States in a Socialist-dominated One World Government, will be dis- cussed in detail in the next chapter . Item 9 in the Summary of Recommendations proposes : That the Atlantic Community take steps to help improve all their economies so that the proportionate economic and social potential of all will be less unequal . This recommendation bears an ominously close resemblance to"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"74 \t America's Unelected Rulers Marxist philosophy . Also, there is the thinly-veiled implication that the \"steps to help improve (Atlantic Community) economies\" would actually involve complete price control and regimentation of in- dustry . CONTROL OF COMMUNICATIONS MEDIA Aware that any suggestion of tampering with the U .S . Constitution- guaranteed freedom of the press would bring cries of outrage from the American people, the Declaration of Paris, in Part II entitled \"Moral and Cultural Questions\" states that the Atlantic Community . . . invites member countries to defend and promote the values and principles of civilization by means of education, publications, lec- tures, radio, the cinema and television . The polite phrase of \"promoting the principles of civilization\" thus hides the fact that the Atlantic Community considers education and mass communications as coming under its jurisdiction . Further, with the mass communication media in the United States under the control of the Council on Foreign Relations, which master-minded the Atlantic Convention, it could be supposed that any public dis- agreement with the aims of the Declaration of Paris could, by the phraseology of this recommendation, be considered as opposing \"the values and principles of civilization .\" It is doubtful, however, that in the final analysis the American people will accept the interpreta- tion of \"values and principles of civilization\" advocated by the De- claration of Paris . EDUCATING THE YOUTH Looking forward to a world peopled by Atlanticans, the Atlantic Convention turned its attention to the youth of its member countries . Section B of Part II of the Declaration of Paris . . . invites the Governments of NATO Nations, and such other coun- tries as may be inspired by the same ideal, to convene an Atlantic Council consisting of Ministers of Education, Ministers for Scientific Affairs, cultural and educational authorities and representatives of universities and scientific research organizations . . . The United States Constitution nowhere gives authority to the Federal Government in matters of education . The Tenth Amendment"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Declaration of Paris \t 75 to the U .S . Constitution reserves this right to the States respectively or to the people thereof in matters of educating America's youth . State governments are responsive to the will of taxpaying parents who, in this way have traditionally been able to exercise a modicum of decision and choice as to how their children shall be educated . Despite frequent attempts by the Federal Government to take over total control of education within the United States, such attempts, as of 1962, have met with firm opposition . The wording of the section in the Declaration of Paris regarding education clearly indicates that if the Atlantic Community is estab- lished, it will, through an Atlantic Council consisting of Ministers of Education from the member nations, exercise supreme control in the educational field, by-passing and/or negating any Constitutional protection for the citizens of the member nations . Interesting to note in this recommendation of the Declaration of Paris is the phrase \"educational authorities and representatives of universities .\" Bearing in mind the millions of dollars which the In- ternationalist-oriented foundations have poured into universities throughout the United States, no question exists as to the political bias of these \"educational authorities\" who will make policy for the Atlantic Council of Ministers of Education . To facilitate the takeover of the education of the youth of member nations, the Declaration of Paris recommends \"organizing a bold Atlantic Plan for Youth and Education .\" The Declaration of Paris gives as its reason for organizing the Atlantic Plan for Youth and Education the aim of \"furthering the study of languages and the widest possible exchange of students, teachers, and youth leaders, and of workers in industry and agri- culture .\" This particular section of the Declaration of Paris perhaps un- wittingly gives an inkling of the speciousness of their \"aim of fur- thering the study of languages\" (with the implied furthering of cul- ture) when it includes the phrase \"workers in industry and agricul- ture .\" Why should factory workers and farmers, who in their re- spective capacities are supporting their families and enjoying the benefits of the Free Enterprise system in America, go junketing off to other countries to study foreign languages 7 The answer is obvious . The \"bold Atlantic Plan for Youth and Ed-"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"76 \t America's Unelected Rulers ucation\" is simply a device to recruit for brainwashing purposes \"students, teachers, youth leaders, workers in industry and agricul- ture,\" and fashion them in the image of Atlanticans, mindless inhab- itants of the proposed Atlantic Community . COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS AT CONTROL SWITCH It is significant that just before the final \"General Resolution\" of the Declaration of Paris urging that all delegates report the same to their respective governments, occurs this paragraph : The Atlantic Convention of NATO Nations recommends that these proposals be studied further by the Atlantic Institute in order to assist in the accomplishment of these tasks . . . It will be recalled, as pointed out in Chapter VI, that the Director General of the Atlantic Institute is Henry Cabot Lodge, who (accord- ing to the 1961 Annual Report of the Council on Foreign Relations) is a member of the CFR . Further, it will be recalled that the follow- ing members of the Atlantic Institute are also members of the CFR : Will Clayton, Dr . James B . Conant, Lewis W . Douglas, William C . Foster, Christian A . Herter, and Adlai E . Stevenson . It can thus be seen that the circus called the Atlantic Convention was for the purpose of giving the trappings of supposed legality to these long-promoted plans of the Council on Foreign Relations, with actual control remaining in the hands of the CFR . EDITORIAL PRESS REACTION It is sad to note that editorial reaction by Conservative members of the nation's press shows a dangerous ignorance of the implica- tions of this Paris Declaration which can, and will, if implemented, destroy the national sovereignty of the United States . Senatorial hearings have been and are available to these editors, as they were available to the authors of this book . But nowhere did we find an analysis, warning, or protest of the implications of the Declaration"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Declaration of Paris \t 77 of Paris in editorials of Conservative daily newspapers within this country . On the other hand, the NEW YORK TIMES, which can be considered the official organ and \"echo chamber\" of the Council on Foreign Re- lations, was ecstatic regarding the results of the Atlantic Conven- tion which culminated in the Declaration of Paris . The NEW YORK TIMES editorialized : . . . The idea of Atlantic Union is on the march . . . .

TWO YEARS WARNING Clarence Streit's FREEDOM & UNION magazine, sharing the exultation of the NEW YORK TIMES, stated in an editorial in its February-March, 1962, issue : Most of all, we welcome the (Atlantic) Convention's recommenda- tion that the NATO governments \"promptly establish a Special Governmental Commission to draw up plans within two years for the creation of a true Atlantic Community, suitably organized to meet the political, military and economic challenges of this era .\" This could permit the Commission to draft a Federal Constitution for an Atlantic Union .

Ball, author of the foregoing statement? He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations . Also, according to a syndicated column by Holmes Alexander, Ball was a partner in the law firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Ball, which has offices in New York, Washington, Paris, and Brussels . Upon his appointment to the highly influential post of Under Secretary of State, George Ball resigned from this firm . The column by Holmes Alexander also states : The firm, now Cleary, Gottlieb & Steen, is listed at the Justice De- partment under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, as being the agent for the Common Market, the European Coal and Steel Commu- nity (and) the European Atomic Energy Community . . . Mr . Alexander in discussing the barrage of propaganda being aimed at the American people for the \"eventual purpose of taking the United States of America into the European Common Market,\" commented : When Alexander Hamilton wanted to bring the separate States of the American Confederation under a Federal Constitution, he first brought the representatives together in Annapolis for a trade con- ference . He rightly reasoned that economic unity would lead to po- litical unity . Then Holmes Alexander continued : The matter will be best understood, and not at all exaggerated, if we ask : Is the U .S .A . prepared to take steps that must inevitably lead to a decision to surrender our national sovereignty, first economic, and finally, political, by becoming a part of another union ? When the United Nations was founded in 1945, its proponents hoped that it could eventually be turned into a World Government organiza- tion . For this reason, the organizational set-up of the UN contained sections dealing with military, economic and political matters . How- ever, because the Soviet Union was a member of the United Nations, and possessed a veto, the UN was able to take only such action as was not displeasing to the Soviet Union and its bloc satellites . Under such conditions the interests of the Free World obviously were not being served. But more than that --the One Worlders were becom- ing aware of a growing distrust, distaste and revulsion over the lack of UN action in some cases (the rape of Tibet, and the massacre of the Hungarian patriots by tanks of the Soviet Union), or by its action in other cases (among them, the UN brutal aggression against the"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"80 \t America's Unelected Rulers independent nation of Katanga in 1961) . The One Worlders realized that public protest within the United States could reach such a point that pressure would be brought by the voters on Members of Congress not to vote any more appropria- tions in support of the United Nations, Without financial support by the United States, the United Nations would be unable to continue functioning . Not to be deterred from their driving compulsion to create a One World Government, the Socialist-Internationalists, operating through the experts of the Council of Foreign Relations, set about the task of fashioning a series of executive agreements, treaties, and regional organizations which would be unaffected should the Commu- nist-dominated United Nations collapse . This chapter deals with the economic policies and organizations formulated by the World Planners . It will be recalled that in the Foreword, Arthur M, Schlesinger, Jr ., a Special Assistant to Presi- dent Kennedy, wrote in a 1947 magazine article : Socialism appears quite practical as a long-term proposition • . . . The active agents in effecting the transition will probably be, not the working class, but some combination of lawyers, business and labor managers, politicians and intellectuals * * * * Socialism • . . must be brought about step by step, in a way which will not disrupt the fabric of custom, law and mutual confidence . . . that is, the transition must be piecemeal ; it must be parliamentary . In commenting upon the ultimate aims of World Socialism, Sen- ator Strom Thurmond stated on the floor of the Senate on August 10, 1961 : Since Marxist Socialists share the ultimate goal of the Commu- nists, their opposition to Communism is limited . . . . They want World Socialism, controlled by themselves, not Russians, or Chi- nese . . . . The Socialists look forward to an international Social- ist order, just as the Communists do, except that they, the Social- ists, are dedicated to the evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, approach . The Socialists do not oppose subversion, for it can pro- mote the evolutionary process toward a world Socialist order . The Socialists join with the Communists in discouraging the inculcation of patriotism, for patriotism is a form of nationalism which impedes the establishment of World Socialism . The biggest stumbling block to World Socialism, from either evo- lutionary or revolutionary methods, is the political and economic"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"European Common Market \t 81 structure of the United States, diluted to some extent with Socialism as it is . EUROPEAN REGIONAL ARRANGEMENTS Ever since the Confederation of the thirteen American colonies into the United States of America, there have been advocates of a similar such arrangement which would be known as the United States of Europe . Only within recent years, however, have such advocates achieved a degree of success in their plans for a European unification along both economic and political lines . Although the organizations which will be discussed in this chapter are primarily European in charac- ter, because they are, for the most part, formed along economic lines, America's interests are affected in the matter of trade be- tween the two continents . If the ultimate aim of these European eco- nomic associations were restricted solely to matters of trade, American citizens would need to feel no great cause for alarm . How- ever, as will be shown, the matter of trade is the mere opening wedge, the real purpose being another gradual step toward the inte- gration of the United States economy with that of Europe - as well as a first step toward a centralized international governing power . ORGANIZATION FOR EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COOPERATION (OEEC) In 1948 the OEEC, the Organization for European Economic Co- operation, was established to enable Western European countries to coordinate the economic policies of its members and to plan for the utlization of Marshall Plan aid . The OE EC had the responsibility for proposing a proper division of United States assistance funds in order to rebuild post-war Europe . WithintheOEEC's framework a trade liberalization program was formulated whereby OEEC mem- bers undertook, more or less simultaneously, to relax their im- port restrictions on one another's goods .

The treaty instituting the European Coal and Steel Community was signed in Paris on April 18, 1951, and came into force for a period of 50 years on July 25, 1952, after the deposit of the instruments of ratification by the six member nations : Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands . According to a pamphlet entitled \"Towards European Integration,\" of November, 1961, published by British Information Services, an agency of the British Government : The specific aims of the ECSC as defined in the body of the treaty are economic - - to promote industrial expansion by creating a common market in coal and steel, i .e ., by doing away with the dis- criminatory and restrictive practices both between states (nations) and internally, which impeded their rational supply and distribution . The Preamble to the Treaty, however, stresses its political signi- ficance as a move toward European unity . In order to implement the ECSC's program, a complex struc- ture of institutions was set up . There is a nine-man executive body' known as the High Authority, with over-all responsibility for the operation of the Community . Its members are appointed by the go- vernments of its members, but once selected they are expected to act not as representatives of the member governments, but rather, as officials of a supranational organization . The High Authority pos- sesses substantial powers . These include the power to finance the operations of the Community through taxes levied on coal and steel enterprises, the power to levy fines when treaty provisions are vio- lated, and the right to inspect the books of all the enterprises of which the community is composed . This, then, is what a \"Community\" really means -- over-all, completely centralized, Socialist control . There is also a Court of Justice according to the treaty \"to in- sure the rule of law in the interpretation and application of the . . . Treaty and of the regulations for its execution .\" In addition there is a Council of Ministers, made up of members of the cabinets of the member nations, plus a Common Assembly,"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"European Common Market \t 83 composed of delegates from the parliaments of the six member coun- tries . As we shall see presently, the organizational set-up of the Euro- pean Coal and Steel Community is of particular interest, since it serves as a model for, and in some cases is shared by, the European Economic Community (EEC), commonly known as the Common Market . EUROPEAN DEFENSE COMMUNITY (EDC) Over-enthusiastic about the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community, the six member nations negotiated a treaty to form a European Defense Community (EDC) . This would have called for the surrender to a supranational agency of a considerable degree of political independence and national control of security policies . However, sufficient political opposition to the EDC was developed, to the point that the French parliament in August, 1954, rejected this Treaty which would have seriously menaced the national sovereignty of France . This was quite a setback to the \"European unity\" ad- vocates, who thereupon decided that the frontal approach of supra- national organizations would have to be scrapped in favor of the more oblique approach of \"economic unity,\" with political unity to come after the individual nations had been sufficiently entangled and em- broiled in the net of economic unity . In order to channel all unity efforts into the direction of economic integration, Paul-Henri Spaak, the Foreign Minister of Belgium, was put in charge of an intergovernmental group to make plans for the next step . In late 1955 and 1956, a detailed Spaak report was pre- pared in which proposals for a Common Market and an Atomic En- ergy Community were set forth . From this emerged the Treaties of Rome . THE TREATIES OF ROME On March 25, 1957, six nations (France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands) signed what are known as the Treaties of Rome .

EUROPEAN ATOMIC ENERGY COMMUNITY (EURATOM) One of the \"communities\" set up by the Rome Treaties was EURATOM, the European Atomic Energy Community, which like the European Coal and Steel Community established in 1952, is restrict- ed to one segment of the economy - in this instance, nuclear energy . Under EURATOM, research on the atom will be carried on and tech- nology will be developed for the \"peaceful use of nuclear energy .\" However, a scientist associated with the Brookhaven National La- boratory stated before a Congressional committee on March 8, 1956 : You cannot distinguish military from peacetime considerations when it is a matter of high-powered reactor producing plutonium .* Even Dr .

These six nations are not only members of GATT, the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade, of which the United States is a member through Executive Agreement, but are also members of NATO . The Common Market is abroad plan for the merging of the econo- mies of its six member nations over the 12 to 15 year period begin- ning January 1, 1958 .

THE CFR, THE CED, AND THE EEC The Council on Foreign Relations is, as could be expected, in- tensely concerned with the European Economic Community . While its members occupying high positions in the Kennedy Administration are actively promoting the idea of \"European unity,\" the Committee for Economic Development, an appendage of the Council on Foreign Relations, is promoting the \"European unity\" theme from a U .S . domestic standpoint, directing its propaganda to U .S . businessmen . The 1960 Annual Report of the Committee for Economic Development states : CED is an organization of 200 businessmen and educators whose primary function is to use objective research to determine private and public policies which will promote economic growth . . .

A booklet entitled \"The European Common Market & Its Meaning to the United States,\" published by the Committee for Economic De- velopment in 1959, in discussing the implications of the Common Market, states : . . . It would be a serious mistake to regard the Market as only a commercial treaty among nations that are and intend to remain independent . The economic provisions go far beyond trade libera- lization, and have profound political implications . A real surren- der of sovereignty is required . With an eye to what can be expected in the future from the Common Market, the CED booklet then goes on to say : Common Market institutions, legislative, executive and judicial, will be established with authority to make and carry out policy in certain matters . They will operate, in part, by majority vote, not by unanimity . It is possible that they may, in the future, be partly directly elected by the people, not chosen by the governments of the member states (nations) . Again we see, spelled out in unequivocal language, the line of the CFR-CED Internationalists and their long-range plan of subverting national governments . This would appear to be in accord with the \"citizen sovereignty instead of national sovereignty\" scheme pro- posed by Clarence Streit . With national governments being completely by-passed, their power would quickly atrophy and wither away, leaving a community of nation-less citizens . Even the small sop to citizens put forth by the Committee on Economic Development that officials of the Common Market legisla- tive, executive and judicial institutions would be \"partly directly elected by the people,\" can be negated, inasmuch as the CED book- let, in discussing the Common Market Treaty further states that a \"framework has been provided for amendments to the Treaty .\" In this way, by amendment, all officials of the legislative, executive and judicial branches of the Common Market could be declared to be \"appointive\" posts only .

Abolition within the Community of obstacles to the free move- ment of persons, services and capital ; . . . Inauguration of common agricultural and transport policies ; . . . Establishment of a system \"insuring\" competition ; . . . Creation of a European Social Fund for education and training of displaced workers ; . . . Establishment of a European investment bank to facilitate eco- nomic expansion . . . . Coordination of monetary and fiscal policies . FREE MOVEMENT OF LABOR In the Treaty of Rome which established the Common Market, Chapter I, entitled \"The Workers\" (Articles 48-51), provides (in summary) The \"free movement of workers\" includes the right to : (a) Take a job that is actually offered ; (b) Move freely throughout the Community for that purpose ; (c) Stay in a country after having held a job there . The Common Market Treaty goes on to say that these provi- sions will be implemented to \"establish a clearinghouse for job of- fers and requests,\" and then states that the Council (of the EEC) will adopt social security measures so that \"social security bene- fits will be cumulative no matter in which country the work is per- formed,\" and that \"benefits will be payable anywhere in the Com- munity .\" Under the foregoing provisions of the Common Market Treaty, in addition to trade barriers being lowered, immigration barriers will be likewise lowered to such an extent that any member nation will be unable to protect itself against an invasion of foreign labor, com- peting for the jobs of the nation's citizens . Note the provision of the \"right\" of workers to \"stay in a country after having held a job there .\" This could be interpreted to mean"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"88 \t America's Unelected Rulers that large masses of unemployed workers could migrate to another country, hold a temporary job in that country, and then automatically become permanent residents . Under this set-up there would be no immigration restrictions regarding their individual moral back- grounds or health qualifications . Nor would the ability of an immigrant to earn a living (and thus not become financially dependent upon the government of the host nation) be considered as a determin? .ng factor . The latter point is anticipated in that portion of the Common Mar- ket treaty which provides for the creation of a European Social Fund for \"training of displaced workers .\" Thus, member nations of the EEC will be saddled with their share of the EEC Social Fund for the support and training of displaced workers emigrating from one country to another ; the cost of all such training, of course, to be ul- timately borne by the taxpayers of all member nations of the Com- mon Market . Another ominous aspect of the provisions dealing with \"free move- ment of workers\" is that should the government of any of the mem- ber nations be infiltrated or taken over by a Communist coup d'etat, the \"work force\" sent by that nation to another member nation could be active Communist agents, bent upon overthrowing the government of the other EEC nation . The recipient nation, under the Common Market Treaty, would not only be powerless to protect itself in such a case, but would actually be assessed social security for such pro- vocateurs . Such implications regarding the potential threat of free movement of a working force cannot be considered an exaggeration in the light of increased Communist influence on the governments of Italy and France, both members of the European Economic Community . As noted previously the Common Market would also \"establish a clearinghouse for job offers and requests .\" Although this pro- vision is intended to apply to the immigrant labor force only, once a member nation has the power to control any segment of labor, it would not be difficult to extend such control even to its native ci- tizens . This could result in government issuance of work permits to all workers . The government would thereby assume the power of life or death over individual laborers . For example, should the political views of any individual member of a government-controlled"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"European Common Market \t 89 labor force not coincide with those of the government, his work per- mit could be withdrawn, thus denying him the right to earn a living for his family and put food in the mouths of his children . SUBSIDIZATION AND CONTROL OF AGRICULTURE The booklet by the Committee for Economic Development, in dis- cussing the provision of the Common Market regarding agriculture, states : A common agricultural policy is to be established . It is clearly intended that agriculture will continue to be controlled and subsi- dized . The March, 1962, issue of ENCOUNTER, a British Left-Wing magazine, analyzes the agricultural provisions of the Common Mar- ket as follows : The European Community is going to establish a completely man- aged system of production, distribution and pricing of food in which market forces will be kept under very strict control . EXPANDING THE CARTEL SYSTEM The CED booklet referred to heretofore summarizes the section of the Rome Treaty entitled \"Rules Governing Competition\" (Arti- cles 85-94) as follows : The general principle is that all agreements between enterprises and decisions by associations of enterprises . . . which prevent, restrict or distort competition . . . are forbidden . At first glance this would appear to forbid the formation, contin- uation or expansion of trade monopolies or cartels in certain fields of industry. However, it is obvious that the above provision is \"win- dow dressing\" for public consumption only, because the CED book- let then immediately qualifies the forgoing statement by continuing : There is a large exception to this principle, however . Agreements which contribute to the improvement of production or distribution, or which promote technical or economic progress, are permitted . Strange to say, the CE D's booklet describes this guarantee of pro- tection for the continuance and expansion of cartels and monopolies as \"a system of insuring competition .\" It is easy to understand the"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"90 \t America's Unelected Rulers great interest that the Rockefeller financial enterprises with their world-wide holdings and cartel arrangements would have in the European Common Market, or any Common Market . What does \"monopoly\" or \"cartel\" mean? Webster's \"New Col- legiate Dictionary\" defines \"cartel\" as follows : An association of private business organizations bound by con- tracts to cooperate in regulating production and marketing of pro- ducts, thus tending to restrict world markets and fix prices . Under the Treaty of Rome the European Economic Community will have the power to decide and allocate markets and areas of industry to favored producers . For example, in the interest of \"improvement of production or distribution,\" one member nation maybe assigned the exclusive right of manufacturing locomotives while another mem- ber nation would have the exclusive right to manufacture ships . Another aspect of the over-all control over individual businesses which will be exercised by the EEC is that manufacturers could in some cases lose the right of decision as to what products they will be permitted to manufacture . The High Council of the EEC will make that decision, and will so inform the manufacturer who, if he wishes to continue in business, must conform . The same system of assigning spheres of \"competition\" could likewise apply to the dividing up of the raw materials in the un- developed areas . This accounts for the unseemly stress which the Internationalists put on the undeveloped areas of the world . It is simply a matter of which firms are to exercise control over certain specific raw materials . In order to facilitate and increase the system of cartelization in Europe, it should be noted that the Rome Treaty establishes a Eu- ropean investment bank to facilitate economic expansion . The Bri- tish Right-Wing newsletter, CANDOUR, in its December 1, 1961, issue, in discussing the implications of the Common Market, states : All this will be done on the pretext of liberalizing trade . But the real motive behind the Common Market is the drive for political and economic monopolies . Amplifying the above statement, the Right-Wing SOUTH AFRICAN OBSERVER of October, 1961, declares : Centralized financial control is, of course, the main weapon being used to force economic and political centralization ."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"European Common Market \t 91 ORGANIZATIONAL SETUP OF THE EEC The primary administrative institutions of the European Economic Community are : (a) A Council of Ministers . The Council of Ministers is compos- ed of one member from each of the Common Market coun- tries . The function of the Council of Ministers is to coor- dinate economic policies of members and DECIDE impor- tant issues . (b) The Commission . The Commission is the administrative or- gan of the Community ; it recommends action to the Council of Ministers and also makes decisions in some cases, as provided in the Treaty of Rome . (c) The Assembly . As of 1962, with 6 European nations compris- ing the EEC, the membership is set at 142 delegates chosen by the parliaments of the 6 member nations . Its function is to review and debate problems of the Community . The Committee for Economic Development's booklet on the subject of Common Market, previously mentioned, brings out an interesting point regarding the Assembly, stating : The Assembly will review (but cannot reject) Council and Commis- sion proposals in cases where the Treaty so provides . It may cen- sure the Commission by a two-thirds majority of those present and an absolute majority of the membership, and thereby force the Com- mission to resign . Surely the above statement verifying the fact that the Assembly can review, but cannot reject, proposals of the all-powerful Coun- cil of Ministers and the Commission would indicate that again we have an example of \"window-dressing\" for public consumption, in order to hide the fact that all power is actually concentrated in the Council of Ministers . (d) A Court of Justice . As provided by the Treaty of Rome, the full court will consist of 7 judges . However, it may also sit in panels of 3 or 5 in certain instances . It will be recalled that earlier in this chapter we discussed the Eu- ropean Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), For purposes of clarifi- cation, let us repeat that the same 6 European nations are members"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"92 \t America's Unelected Rulers of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), EURATOM, and the Common Market (EEC) . Because they share the same member- ship and closely cooperate, the Treaty of Rome provided for a cer- tain consolidation in order to eliminate duplicative organizations . For example, the European Coal and Steel Community, EURATOM, and the European Economic Community are all under the same Coun- cil of Ministers . Likewise, the Court of Justice serves as legal ad- judicator for the three Communities . In the legislative field, all three communities share the same European Parliamentary Assem- bly . However, at the executive level, directly under the Council of . Ministers, the three Communities have separate organs, i .e ., the High Authority of the ECSC, the Commission of the European Ato- mic Energy Community, and the Commission of the European Eco- nomic Community, all functioning as distinct entities . HOW WILL THE EUROPEAN COMMON MARKET AFFECT THE U .S .? In early 1962, leading spokesmen for the Council on Foreign Re- lations, both within and outside the government, as well as mem- bers of the CFR-controlled news media began a massive propaganda campaign urging that President Kennedy be given executive power to unilaterally reduce tariffs in order to compete with the European Common Market . An example of this propaganda line was voiced by a State Department spokesman in an address before the Texas Group of Investment Bankers on April 9, 1962, to wit : As the tariffs among the members of the EEC move toward zero, and the external tariff becomes standardized, American companies selling in Italy, for example, will be ata disadvantage as compared with, say, German companies, because American imports into Italy will have to pay the tariff while German imports will not . The State Department spokesman then went on to point out how Common Market tariffs will \"discriminate against American ex- ports in favor of internal EEC trade .\" Those who propose wiping out U .S . tariffs in order to be able to compete with the European Common Market countries conveniently overlook the fact that during the last 28 years, when increasing num- bers of American workingmen and American industries badly needed some form of protection, our government gradually reduced our im-"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"European Common Market \t 93 port duties by 77% . By 1962, U .S . import duties were the lowest of any major industrial nation . While advocating the reduction of trade barriers, Great Britain and others quietly increased their tariffs on many items . While U .S . tariffs were going down, theirs were going up . During the years 1950 to 1960, U .S . imports from Europe in- creased by 300%, while U .S, exports rose by only 112% . It would ap- pear there is no need to further reduce tariffs in the face of such statistics . Foreign nations are eager to sign Reciprocal Trade agreements with the United States . However, as soon as American imports be- gin to hurt their local industries, or as soon as new factories (built by U .S . Foreign Aid funds) are ready to go into operation in their countries, foreign nations resort to such devices as tightening up on currency exchange, the issuance of import licenses, etc . Thus, while not actually breaking their Reciprocal Trade agreements with the U .S ., such countries effectively manage to keep out U .S . goods which would compete with their own products . Accordingly, any agreement made with Common Market countries to reduce tariffs against their products in order to facilitate the ex- port of U .S . products to the EEC nations could immediately be \"amended\" by the Council of Ministers which governs the EEC whenever such U .S . exports cause injury to the economy of an EEC nation . Actually, the reason behind the propaganda push in favor of wiping out U .S . tariffs has very little to do with the tariff question . The question at stake is : To what extent will the United States cooperate with or participate in the European Common Market? On February 22, 1962, in an address made at Davidson College, Davidson, North Carolina, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, stated \"It is not our intent to join the Common Market .\" The statement by Secretary of State Dean Rusk should be taken to mean exactly the opposite . In other words, as will be proven later, Secretary of State Rusk envisages a far deeper involvement with European nations than that which would be provided by merely join- ing with the European Common Market for trade purposes ."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IX ECONOMIC INVOLVEMENT OF THE UNITED STATES VIA OECD In Chapter VI entitled \"Atlantic Community - The Master Trap\" we traced the various seemingly parallel organizations whose guiding hand, for the most part, was the Council on Foreign Re- lations .

Not generally known is that fact that this same Atlantic Congress also unanimously urged the governments of NATO countries to give consideration to the possibility of \"transforming the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) into an organization for Atlantic economic cooperation in which all the Atlantic coun- tries would hold full membership .\" The unanimous report of the Atlantic Congress then urged that this proposed organization should \"give immediate and urgent at- tention to the closer unity of the European Economic Community (Common Market) with the other economies of Western Europe and the Free World .\" It also recommended that the proposed organiza- tion \"coordinate national policies and develop cooperative policies for accelerating the economic progress of developing areas of the Atlantic Community and of the world .\" Only 21 months were to pass before this proposal by the citizen- delegates of the Atlantic Congress reached the proportions of a treaty which the United States Senate was called upon to ratify .

Senator Javits then went on to say that the Organization for Eco- nomic Cooperation and Development \"was intended to be, and is essentially, a consultative body .\" The following documentation on the OECD would indicate Javits was in error . BACKGROUND OF THE OECD Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, George C . McGhee*, according to the Department of State BULLETIN, January 22, 1962, in tracing the chronology of OECD, stated : A decade after NATO was founded, another step was taken toward Atlantic-wide cooperation on an institutional basis . The OE EC (Or- ganization for European Economic Cooperation), offspring of the Marshall Plan and embracing only European countries, was reorgan- ized in 1960 as the OECD-Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development - including 18 European states, the United States and Canada . With it is associated, for purposes of coordination of aid programs, the Government of Japan .** John S . Stillman, Deputy to Under Secretary of State George Ball, described the purposes of the OECD in a speech January 20, 1962, as follows : The OECD is designed for the tasks of the sixties by providing a forum for consultation, aimed at maximizing the member nations' * Douglas Dillon, President Eisenhower and Under Secretary of State McGhee are CFR members . ** The entire membership list of the OECD, as of date of ratification by the Senate, March 16, 1961, was as follows : Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Western Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Great Britain, Northern Ireland, and the United States of America ."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"96 \t America's Unelected Rulers economic growth, at aiding the less developed countries to achieve sound economic expansion, and at contributing to the expansion of world trade on a multilateral, non-discriminatory basis in accord- ance with international obligations . OECD's Council of Ministers has stressed the need to reduce trade barriers between its member states and between the OECD countries and the rest of the world . It is interesting to note the similarity between the European Com- mon Market and the OECD . The European Coal and Steel Commu- nity, EURATOM and the European Common Market all operate under one Council of Ministers ; the OECD likewise has a Council of Minis- ters . One purpose of both the European Common Market and the OECD is to reduce trade barriers . One difference, however, between the European Communities and the OECD is that the United States belongs to the OECD, as does Canada, while neither belong to the EEC . Another striking similarity between the OECD and the European Common Market is the OECD's apparent preoccupation with atomic energy . The OECD's Preparatory Committee recommended parti- cipation of the Commission of EURATOM in the work of the OECD's European Nuclear Energy Agency . Another recommendation of the OECD Preparatory Committee urges the \"liberalization of manpower movements\" and \"the abo- lition of entry visas for nationals of Member countries traveling to their place of work .\" Both of the above recommendations of the Preparatory Committee of OECD parallel the functions of EURATOM and the European Eco- nomic Community . The reason for such duplication of functions and institutions within these organizations, or \"communities,\" would ap- pear to be twofold : (1) to guarantee that should either structure fail because of lack of public support, or awareness by the public of its ultimate aim, the counterpart organization would still be in ex- istence ; and (2) as stated earlier, this is one way of specifically in- volving the United States, without seeming to do so, directly in the activities of the European Economic Community . Another aim of the OECD, according to the Convention, is to . . , contribute to sound economic expansion in Member as well as non-member countries in the process of economic development .

Of course, therewould be the implica- tion that through the OECD Treaty the U .S,had already been \"com- mitted,\" and therefore the only detail lacking was an appropriation by Congress so that the U .S . could not be accused before the world of not living up to its \"obligations .\" This accounts in some measure for the great emphasis on \"long-term\" Foreign Aid which has in the past few years been urged upon Congress . Another reason for bringing Foreign Aid under the aegis of a treaty, duly ratified by the United States Senate, is to put Foreign Aid beyond the control of Congress, inasmuch as the treaty loophole in the U .S . Constitution provides that treaties shall be the \"supreme law of the land .\"* The establishment of the OECD thus can be seen as a maneuver to saddle the U .S . taxpayers permanently with assessments for Foreign Aid, even though Congress might wish to defeat a Foreign Aid bill in the future . An indication of the fear of the Internationalists that the United Na- tions might founder was brought out in the hearings before the Com- mittee on Foreign Relations of the United States Senate prior to the ratification of the OECD Treaty, when Senator George D . Aiken, of Vermont, asked the question : Is the base of this convention broad enough so that if the United Nations foundered, the OECD, with a compatible membership, could take over many of the economic functions now performed by the United Nations ? To this question, Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon, CFR member, replied, \"Well, I think it is broad enough to do anything of that nature . . .\" Secretary Dillon's statement thus clarifies the actual scope of OECD, which was promoted as a \"consultative\" program only .

ECONOMIC COUNCIL LETTER (No . 515)* of November 15,1961, in describing what \"orderly economic growth\" within underdevelop- ed nations can mean referred to a speech by George Ball, Under Se- cretary of State, and then commented : He (George Ball) said that if we are going to give development capital to \"underdeveloped nations\" it will be necessary for us to help them market their produce . Their work will be mostly in the primary industries like textile, mining and like manufacture . Ad- vanced nations, like the United States, should willingly abandon these industries to the underdeveloped nations, though textiles is our second largest employer . Of course our government would have to compensate our abandoned industries and help transfer them to new activities . The machinery for such Federal intervention in indus- trial growth has already been voted by Congress in the Area Re- development Bill . The Federal Government can now create de- pressed areas to its heart's content and buy off the opposition of industry, labor and local government officials with its \"develop- ment assistance\" for Americans . Under Secretary Ball's statement leaves no doubt of the goal - the United States is to give up its eco- nomic boundaries and let itself be merged with the world economy, without any ability to protect itself except through aid provided from Washington by the Planners .

Overlooked, however, was the fact that a large portion of the power of Congress to regulate tariffs had previously been delegated by Congress to the President . The proponents of OECD, wishing to stifle any and all opposition to the ratification of the treaty, and being prepared for such objec- tions after having heard testimony from businessmen's groups, in- serted the following qualifying phrase into the OECD Treaty : . . . that nothing in the Convention, or the advice and consent of the Senate to the ratification thereof, confers any power upon the Ex- ecutive to bind the United States in substantive matters beyond what the Executive now has, or to bind the United States without compli- ance with applicable procedures imposed by domestic law, . . , or limits Congress in the exercise of any power it now has . Reading between the lines of the above so-called \"protective\" clause in the treaty clearly indicates that the OECD proponents are well aware that Congress has, in previous sessions, abdicated to the Executive large portions of its Constitutional control over tariffs . There were, however, two active opponents of OECD in the Senate . One was Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who attempted to rally opposition to the OECD Convention among his constituents via his weekly newsletter, and who in his statements on the floor of the Senate referred to the \"inherent dangers of this Convention .\" The other was Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, whose re- marks will be discussed later in this chapter .

Immediately, the question arises : Who will be the U .S . represen- tative on the OECD whose vote can have a profound effect on the des- tiny of this nation? Mr, H . B . McCoy, President, Trade Relations Council of the United States, Washington, D .C ., in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings, stated that \"The U .S . representative on the OECD Council (who will be an official of the Department of State) . . .\" In the foregoing excerpts from the OECD Treaty, it was noted that no decision would be binding on any Member nation unless it \"com- plied with the requirements of its own constitutional procedures .\" Mr . Enoch R . Rust, Vice President, United Glass and Ceramic Work- ers of North America, in testifying before the Senate Foreign Rela- tions Committee, brought out the following point in this connection : The trouble with that is that the State Department would decide what was in line with our Constitution . If that department has no greater respect for our Constitution than is reflected by its propo- sal that we become full-fledged Members of the OECD, it is not difficult to guess what they would accept from the OECD as being in accord with our Constitution . A memorandum from the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations for the purpose of clarifying the issues involved, states : It may be noted that it is expected that most of the decisions taken by the OECD Council which will be binding on Member governments will not pertain to substantive matters, but will pertain to adminis- trative matters . . . It should be borne in mind that the State Department representative to the OECD will be a representative of the President, to whom the President will delegate his executive authority . It was noted in the supposedly \"protective\" amendment to the OECD Treaty that the United States would not be bound \"in substan- tive matters\" beyond the powers the Executive now has .

The fact that the State Department urged ratification of the OECD Treaty proves that indeed the treaty did extend the powers of the President in substantive matters, which authority he then was able to delegate to the State Department repre- sentative of the OECD . Because of the extent of powers delegated to the Presidency by Congress since the advent of the New Deal in 1933, a definition of what constitutes \"substantive\" matters would be difficult indeed . A legal definition of such \"substantive matters\" would require a Su- preme Court review of every abdication of Constitutional authority by Congress to the Executive since 1933 . During the Senate debate on OECD Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona anticipated that a situation would arise in the future where- in the Senate would be called upon \"to approve what the U .S . repre- sentative to the OECD has done .\" Senator Goldwater then elaborated : It seems to me that such requirement would put Congress in the position of having to go along with the statement of agreement, or plan of action, which our representative to the OECD has made prior to the approval coming to the attention of Congress . As a result we shall go into this (OECD) Convention already obligated, if not in fact, at least by the word of our representative . How can Congress be free to act under those circumstances and withstand the terrific pressure which will be applied to back up agreements made by our representative to the OECD? Even though only a reasonable time has elapsed since the ratifi- cation of the OECD Treaty, an indication of the State Department's intention to expand the functions of the OECD is a statement by Under Secretary of State George Ball appearing in the April 23, 1962 BULLETIN of the State Department : We are prepared to go as far as any other Member of the OECD in concerting our economic policies . . . In ratifying the OECD Treaty, the Senate implemented the over- all plan of the Council on Foreign Relations to by-pass Congress and vest power over the economy of the United States in an organization composed of foreign nations ; foreign nations are thereby enabled to make recommendations and take decisions which could have the power of law in the United States .

In a speech reprinted in the BULLETIN of the State Department, April 16, 1962, Under Secretary of State George Ball stated : If the United Nations is an instrument of United States policy, it is only one of many instruments available to us . . . . It is therefore important to be clear not only about what the United Nations does, but what it does not do . . . Clarity on this score helps solve the contra- dictions some people seem to find on American foreign policy, a con- tradiction between our reliance on the institutions of the Atlantic Community and our participation in the United Nations . No such con- tradiction, in fact, exists . The founders of the United Nations recog- nized the need for regional institutions and explicitly provided for them in the Charter . . . .

Although the OECD was purported to be concerned solely with in- tegrating the economic policies of its member nations, the fact is that the U .S . national economy and foreign policy are not separable . Fearing a public outcry should any overt moves be made to sub- vert the national sovereignty of the United States, the One Worlders have moved cautiously through first one regional or international organization and then another, many times in parallel lines, always working toward their ultimate goal .

By early 1962, State Department spokesmen were employing the phrase \"Atlantic partnership\" with ever-increasing frequency .

In an address at Davidson College February 22, 1962, Secretary of State Dean Rusk stated : Our interests and hopes run not merely to Europe, but also to Latin America and to the whole community of free nations . We look to a partnership between the United States and an increasingly uni- fied Europe .

And the prospective partnership between the Eu- ropean Common Market and the great common market of North Am- erica, is for many of us the most exciting single job of institution- building now in progress .

FACILITATING SOVIET WORLD CONQUEST When certain members of the Council on Foreign Relations speak glowingly of a Free World community, they fail to inform the Ameri- can people that because of the existence of the Soviet Union and its continuing aggression, the realization of such a dream is impossible for the following reason : All regional organizations such as NATO, EEC and OECD are actually under the control of the Soviet-dominat- ed United Nations, as provided by the UN Charter . The Soviet Union, therefore, will permit the establishment and functioning of regional or so-called \"Free World\" communities onlyaslongas it suits the purposes of the International Communist Conspiracy . Rather than having to conquer each nation separately, which of course could provoke a third World War resulting in the defeat of the Soviet Union, the USSR would simply have to infiltrate the key positions of each Free World country . This would quickly result in Communist control of the policies of the country, with such nations being forced to appoint Communist-oriented representatives to the various regional groupings of the Free World community . Such a so-called Free World community would soon become a Soviet com- munity . It will be recalled that it was Lenin who stated : A single world economic system is essential for the final triumph of Socialism . In the March 6, 1961, issue of THE DAN SMOOT REPORT*, Mr .

Dictatorship can be established only by a victory of Socialism in different countries or groups of countries, after which the prole- tarian republics would unite on federal lines with those already in existence, and this system of federal unions would expand . . . at length forming the World Union of Socialist Soviet Republics . The authors of this book most assuredly do not mean to imply that certain members of the Council on Foreign Relations, former or present Presidents of the United States as well as State Department officials would consciously facilitate the Soviet drive for world con- quest .

THE NEW YORK TIMES, editorializing on the Atlantic Convention in Paris, January, 1962, referred to a speech made by Christian A .

Then THE NEW YORK TIMES went on to say : This is, in effect, the same functional approach toward union which Europe has adopted after more ambitious plans hadfailed . It is all the more necessary because any suggestion of even a partial surren- der of American sovereignty still meets the most determined op- position . If the United States is to remain a free and independent nation ; if American citizens wish to retain their Constitutional guarantees of individual freedom and liberty, then the \"most determined opposi- tion\" to the surrender of national sovereignty about which THE NEW YORK TIMES complained must, of course, remain \"most deter- mined .\" In addition, if a sufficiently large number of American voters become informed as to the real meaning of the plans of the Council on Foreign Relations and the One Worlders, the American people can again take into their hands the reins of government, and \"America's Unelected Rulers\" will be deposed . POSTSCRIPT The reader may be interested to know that we commenced writing this book on May 16, 1962, and completed this chapter one month later, on June 15 . It will be recalled that on page 77, in Chapter VII, entitled \"The Declaration of Paris, there occurs a paragraph which is headed \"Two Years Warning .\" In this paragraph we quoted the February- March, 1962, issue of Clarence Streit's FREEDOM&UNION maga- zine, in which Mr . Streit stated : We welcome the (Atlantic) Convention's recommendation that the NATO governments \"promptly establish a Special Governmental Commission to draw up plans within two years for the creation of a true Atlantic Community . . . .\""},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"108 \t America's Unelected Rulers Only three days were to pass after the completion of Chapter X, before the NEW ORLEANS TIMES-PICAYUNE (June 18, 1962) carried on its front page an Associated Press news story by Lewis Hawkins entitled \"Closer Unity of NATO Bloc is Called For - Im- mediate Steps Urged by Commission .\" Following are excerpts from the AP story : WASHINGTON (AP) -- A congressionally appointed citizens' commission said Sunday steps must be taken to make the Atlantic community a reality and they must betaken soon -- even if this in- volves some yielding of national sovereignty . Creation of a permanent high council and a high court of justice for the nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization were among the chief recommendations submitted to Congress by the U .S .

However, noticeably absent from this news dispatch are a number of sinister provisions of the Declaration of Paris, on which this AP story was based . Full documentation regarding the contents of the Declaration of Paris is contained in Chapter VII, beginning on Page 70 . The most important aspect of this latest development is the fact that the recommendations of the U .S . Citizens' Commission on NATO concerning the Declaration of Paris have now been submitted to the U .S . Congress for implementation . Congress is being asked to authorize the setting up of a Special Governmental Commission to draw up plans for the creation of an Atlantic Community .

McCarthy . Rovere in this article com- bines an amazing amount of truth along with some misleading state- ments indicative of either planned confusion or alarming ignorance . When Rovere says \"There are times when Congress appears to be nothing more or less than a conspiracy to louse up the plans of the Establishment,\" he reveals his ignorance of the major goals of the CFR-directed Establishment, which are : continued Foreign Aid, in- creased Cultural Exchange, increasing the scope of International or- ganizations, and Disarmament . Looking at the legislative measures which carried out these four major goals of the CFR during the year 1961, we find that a majori- ty of the members of the House of Representatives and the U .S . Se- nate voted for bills which implemented these four major goals of the Council on Foreign Relations . Rovere then makes the following statement : \"It (the Establish- ment) is never quite powerful enough, though, to control a nominating convention or actually to dictate nominations .\" Rovere qualifies this erroneous declaration by quoting another source who rightly claims that during the past thirty years the major political parties have almost always managed to nominate a member of the Establishment in either the presidential or vice- presidential slot . Rovere points out that in 1960 Kennedy was the CFR's boy on the Democrat slate, while Henry Cabot Lodge was their man on the Republican ticket . Apparently Richard M .

The CFR, the Establishment, or the Invisible Government -as it is term- ed by Dan Smoot - was due to win the 1960 election regardless of whether the Democrats or the Republicans put their nominee in the White House . Richard Rovere rightly says that the re-written Rock- efeller-Nixon GOP platform conformed in almost every respect to the 1960 Democrat Party platform hammered out under the direc- tion of CFR-man Chester Bowles . Rovere then reveals that both platforms obtained their central ideas from studies made by the Rockefeller Panel for the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and published as \"Prospect for America .\" The Rockefeller Panel was composed of such extreme-Left Democrats as Dean Rusk, Chester Bowles, Jacob Potofsky, Anna Rosenberg, and Henry Kissinger . Internation- alist Republicans on the panel were : Lucius D . Clay, Arthur F . Burns, Henry Luce, Oveta Culp Hobby, and David Sarnoff . CFR MEMBERS HOLD KEY POSITIONS IN BOTH DEMOCRAT AND GOP ADMINISTRATIONS We have previously (in Chapter III) given the names of key CFR members who hold most of the important administrative posts in the New Frontier Administration of the Kennedy dynasty . Lest the impression be given that the Council on Foreign Relations operates solely through the Democrat Party, letus examine the ex- tent of the CFR control of the Republican Party specifically during the Eisenhower Administration . Although the 1952 Republican plat- form and the campaign speeches of presidential candidate Dwight Eisenhower purported to be strongly anti-Communist, numerous members of the \"soft-on-Communism\" Council on Foreign Rela- tions were appointed to key posts in the first Eisenhower Admin- istration . The following names and positions were taken from the 1954 \"Congressional Directory .\" All are members of the Council on Foreign Relations : Secretary of State : John Foster Dulles Deputy Under Secretary of State : Robert Murphy Counselor of the State Department : Douglas MacArthur 2d Director, Policy Planning Staff : Robert R .

Thus it is seen that regardless of whether a Republican or a De- mocrat administration occupies the White House, the Council on Foreign Relations still holds the reins of control . INVESTIGATE THE STATE DEPARTMENT? Bryton Barron, formerly Chief of the Treaty Staff in the State Department, has just written a new book entitled \"The Untouchable State Department*,\" in which he outlines the causes of the failure of our foreign policies for the last twenty years, and in which he names many of the persons largely responsible for those failures . It is a book that should be read by everyone who is concerned with his country's future . In the final chapter, Mr . Barron suggests that millions of aroused Americans should demand that the Congress in- vestigate the State Department in order to correct the intolerable situation described in his revealing book . Before any such investigation is possible, the anti-Communist Conservatives of the United States must change the present compo- sition of the Congress . As the situation now exists, there are sim- ply not enough members of Congress who believe that any investi- gation is necessary . This statement must be substantiated, and to properly do so, we will shortly refer specifically to the voting re- cords of Congressmen and Senators who by their votes are imple- menting the anti-American policies of the Council on Foreign Re- lations . THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONGRESS The fact that the Congress has delegated so much of its Consti- tutional power to the Executive branch is the real reason why so * \"The Untouchable State Department,\" published by Crestwood Books, Box 301, Springfield, Virginia .

As each succeeding session of Congress has delegated its own power and authority to the President, it has in fact emasculated itself, and today is, in effect, a rubber stamp for Execu- tive actions which accommodate the appeasers and support the In- ternal and External enemies of our Constitutional way of life . Of course, all the crimes committed against the Constitution by previous sessions of Congress cannot be pinned on the present mem- bers of Congress . Yet there is one basic hope, one golden opportu- nity, one path of escape -- one method -- by which Americans can put on the brakes and prevent our continued slide into Socialism, Ty- ranny, and Communism . The only legal means by which American patriots can hope to re- verse this 30-year trend is by electing a Congress composed of men who will pledge \"their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor\" to restore the Constitution as it was originally written and intended . A new Congress composed of anti-Communist Constitutionalists need not be bound by the actions or mistakes of previous sessions of the Congress . BI-PARTISAN COALITION PROMOTES SOCIALISM A study of the voting records of recent Congressional sessions proves that it is the bi-partisan coalition of certain Republicans and Democrats which makes possible the passage of pro-Socialist and pro-Communist legislation . A few years ago, the much-needed \"Bricker Amendment\" failed of passage by only one vote . Under the direction and manipulation of Lyndon Johnson, then Majority Leader, the Senate failed by one vote to pass a law restoring to the States their right to control subversion at the State level . Fulton Lewis, Jr ., the respected Conservative radio commentator and nationally-syndicated columnist, in reporting on the success of the first year of the Kennedy Administration, quoted voting records to prove that Liberal members of the Republican Party made possi- ble the passage of 6 key pieces of Kennedy's New Frontier legisla- tion .

Senate during 1961, the first session of the Kennedy Admin- istration . Based on the tabulation of these votes, each Member of Congress was then given a Conservative rating according to the num- ber of times he cast votes in favor of Conservatism . Thus Senator Strom Thurmond, Democrat of South Carolina, received a 100% Con- servative rating while Senator Alexander Wiley, Republican of Wis- consin, received a 100% pro-Socialist, \"soft-on-Communism\" rat- ing . When considering the House of Representatives, it was found that 67% of the entire membership voted 50% or more of the time for Big Federal Spending, Foreign Aid to Communist countries, and Inter- nationalism . In the Senate, the total figure revealed that 72% of that body voted more than 50% of the time for pro-Socialist and pro-Com- munist legislation . HOW CONGRESS VOTES TO SUPPORT CFR-SPONSORED LEGISLATION Let us now look at the voting record of the Congress in connection with the major goals of the Council on Foreign Relations . The aims of the CFR are : 1 . Permanent and expanding Foreign Aid to friendandfoe alike ; 2 . Increasing U .S . - Soviet Cultural Exchange ; 3 . Continuing negotiations with the Soviet Union for Disarma- ment ; 4 . Building supra-national organizations such as the Atlantic Community which will destroy U .S . national sovereignty and lead to a One-World Socialist government . Analyzing votes in the Congress which facilitate the accomplish- ment of these goals, we find that 71 out of 100 Senators voted for (or expressed themselves in favor of) legislation supporting these four CFR aims during the 1961 session . Of these 71 Senators, 48 * \"The CSA Voting Index\" described above maybe obtained from the Conser- vative Society of America, P . O . Box 4254, New Orleans 18, Louisiana .

Thus, in the Senate, of the total of 36 Republicans, 23, or 64%, voted for the CFR position . Of the Democrat Senators, 75% voted pro-CFR . In the House of Representatives, 260 out of 436 members voted for (or expressed their intention to vote for) all four of the legisla- tive measures supporting CFR goals . Thus 59 .5%of the House mem- bers lined themselves up solidly with the pro-Internationalist and \"soft-on-Communism\" position of the Council on Foreign Relations . In the House, out of 174 Republicans, 80 GOP Congressmen, or 46%, voted pro-CFR on the four key issues . Of the Democrat Congress- men, 68% voted pro-CFR . CONSERVATIVES CAN WIN These summary figures would seem to indicate that changing the composition of the Congress through patriotic political action would be almost an impossible job . However, let us recall by what a nar- row margin key pro-Socialist programs have been voted into law . Another fact that gives hope to Conservatives is that there are at least 24 Congressional Districts where the incumbent Liberal Con- gressman has achieved election by fewer than 10,000 votes . In several cases, the incumbent Liberal has squeaked through with fewer than 400 votes .* An intelligently-directed, properly-financed program of political education within marginal Congressional districts can build an ef- fective Conservative-oriented political action organization which can succeed in replacing ultra-Liberals with Constitutional Conser- vatives . Some say that we should elect a manlike Senator Barry Goldwater, or Senator Strom Thurmond to the office of the Presidency, and then we could \"forget\" all these troublesome problems . But let us con- sider for a moment how frustrated such a Conservative President would be if he were opposed by the kind of Congress we have in 19621 * This information is based on statistics included in \"The Conservative Po- litical Action Handbook,\" published by the Conservative Society of America .

Under the Constitution, the House of Representatives has control of the nation's purse-strings . The White House and the Council on Fo- reign Relations could continue to urge the passage of increasing Fo- reign Aid, but if a Conservative-controlled Congress refused to ap- propriate funds for Foreign Aid, what difference would it make what the White House and the CFR advocated? Private citizen groups of \"experts\" could shuttle back and forth across the Atlantic setting up regional supra-national organizations and making grandiose plans to a \"fare -thee-well .\" But such travel would have to be at their own expense, because a Conservative Congress would not pass any appro- priations to finance such junkets . Further, any so-called \"recom- mendations\" or treaties that these citizen-delegates would drawup would be mere scraps of paper, because a Conservative-dominated Senate would refuse to ratify them . The job of changing the present composition of the Congress is not as big as it would seem ; whereas in a presidential campaign the anti- Communist Conservatives would first have to capture the nomina- tion for their candidate in one of the major parties . The Interna- tionalist Republicans denied the nomination to Senator Robert A . Taft on two occasions .

At the local level, the supporters of the incumbent \"soft- on-Communism\" - voting Liberal Congressman can be individually approached and warned concerning the nature of the incumbent's vot- ing record .

This is not intended to mean that said CFR members, as of 1962, hold the same views . In some instances, a CFR member listed in this Appendix may have repudiated his former position and be- come a \"friendly witness,\" furnishing valuable information to Congressional investigating committees . The purpose of this compilation is to give the reader an insight into the views held by some CFR members during stated periods in their careers . The organizations and activities in which certain CFR members have participated will be dealt with in two categories : Section 1 - Activities which have aided Communist aims and goals, including those which have been cited by Federal or State investigating committees as Communist, Communist- controlled, or subversive, and those apparently \"Communist- promoting\" activities which have not been cited . Section 2 - Activities relating to the Institute of Pacific Re- lations, regarding which the Senate Committee on the Judi- ciary concluded : \"The net effect of IPR activities on United States public opinion has been such as to serve international Communist interests and to affect adversely the interests of the United States .\" (IPR Report, p . 225) 1 35"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"136 \t America's Unelected Rulers The listings which follow do not purport to be complete, inasmuch as they are limited to the Government documents at our disposal for this purpose .

CFR member Wilson's committee sponsored, and the American Council on Education published, a booklet entitled \"Textbook Improvement and International Understanding,\" which contains the following quotation by Dr .

Wilson* are out- lined in this 11th Report of the Dilworth Committee in connection with a study prepared under his direction on the \"Treatment of Asia in American Textbooks .\" Working in this same area of endeavor was CFR member George Stoddard* of the State Univer- sity of Iowa, who found that \"Many of the texts seemed to sustain imperialistic tendencies and American nationalistic pride at sacrifice of the truthful presentation of the Filipino viewpoint .\" In 1958, the Dilworth Committee, in its 16th Report, makes a thorough exploration of a teachers' handbook entitled \"Education for International Understanding in American Schools,\"** authored by the Committee on International Relations of the National Edu- cation Association and published by the NEA in 1948 . In this NEA handbook acknowledgment is given to the following CFR members : Ben M . Cherrington, Howard E . Wilson, and James T . Shotwell .
