I had just returned home from indoortennis on the chilly, windy Sunday afternoon of March 16, 2008. A seniorofficial of the Federal Reserve Board was on the phone to alert me of theboard’s just-announced invocation, for the first time in decades, of the obscurebut explosive section 13 (3) of the Federal Reserve Act. Broadly interpreted,section 13 (3) empowered the Federal Reserve to lend nearly unlimited cash tovirtually anybody.1 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber0] OnMarch 16, it empowered the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend $29 billionto facilitate the acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan.Bear Stearns, the smallest of the major investment banks, founded in 1923, wason the edge of bankruptcy, having run through nearly $20 billion of cash justthe previous week. Its demise was the beginning of a six-month erosion in globalfinancial stability that would culminate with the Lehman Brothers failure onSeptember 15, 2008, triggering possibly the greatest financial crisis ever. Tobe sure, the Great Depression of the 1930s involved a far greater collapse ineconomic activity. But never before had short-term financial markets, thefacilitators of everyday commerce, shut down on so global a scale. The drying upof deeply liquid markets, literally overnight, as investors swung from euphoriato fear, dismantled vast financial complexes and led to a worldwide contractionin economic activity. The role of human nature in economic affairs was nevermore apparent than on that fateful day in September and in the weeks thatfollowed.On the face of it, the financial crisis also represented an existential crisisfor economic forecasting. I began my postcrisis investigations, culminating inthis book, in an effort to understand how we all got it so wrong, and what wecan learn from the fact that we did. At its root, then, this is a book aboutforecasting human nature, what we think we know about the future and what wedecide we should do about it. It’s about the short term and the long term, andperhaps most important, about the foggy place where the one turns into theother. We are at this moment faced with a number of serious long-term economicproblems, all in a sense having to do with underinvesting in our economicfuture. My most worrisome concern is our broken political system. It is thatsystem on which we rely to manage our rule of law, defined in our Constitution(see Chapter 14 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-19.xhtml]). My fondest hope for thisbook is that some of the insights my investigations have yielded will be of someuse in bolstering the case for taking action now, in the short term, which is inour long-term collective self-interest despite the unavoidable short-term painit will bring. The only alternative is incalculably worse pain and humansuffering later. There is little time to waste.THE FORECASTING IMPERATIVEAs always, though we wish it were otherwise, economic forecasting is adiscipline of probabilities. The degree of certainty with which the so-calledhard sciences are able to identify the metrics of the physical world appears tobe out of the reach of the economic disciplines. But forecasting, irrespectiveof its failures, will never be abandoned. It is an inbred necessity of humannature. The more we can anticipate the course of events in the world in which welive, the better prepared we are to react to those events in a manner that canimprove our lives.Introspectively, we know that we have a limited capability to see much beyondour immediate horizon. That realization has prompted us, no doubt from beforerecorded history, to look for ways to compensate for this vexing human“shortcoming.” In ancient Greece, kings and generals sought out the advice ofthe oracle of Delphi before embarking on political or military ventures. Twomillennia later, Europe was enthralled by the cryptic prognostications ofNostradamus. Today, both fortune-tellers and stock pickers continue to make apassable living. Even repeated forecasting failure will not deter theunachievable pursuit of prescience, because our nature demands it.ECONOMETRICSA key plot point in the history of our efforts to see the future has been thedevelopment over the past eight decades of the discipline of model-basedeconomic forecasting. That discipline has embraced many of the same mathematicaltools employed in the physical sciences, tools used by almost all economicforecasters, both in government and in the private sector, largely to buildmodels that “explain” the past, and perhaps, as a consequence, make the futuremore comprehensible.I was drawn to the sophistication of the then-new mathematical economics as agraduate student at Columbia University in the early 1950s. My professors JacobWolfowitz and Abraham Wald were pioneers in mathematical statistics.2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber1] But my early fascinationwas increasingly tempered over the years by a growing skepticism about itsrelevance to a world in which the state of seemingly unmodelable animal spiritsis so critical a factor in economic outcomes.John Maynard Keynes, in his groundbreaking 1936 opus, The General Theory ofEmployment, Interest and Money, set the framework for much of modern-daymacromodeling. The Keynesian model, as it came to be known, to this day governsmuch government macroeconomic policy. Keynes’s model was a complete, thoughsimplified version of how the major pieces of a market economy fit together. Theclass of models that today we still call Keynesian is widely employed in thepublic and private sectors, especially to judge the impact of variousgovernmental policies on the levels of GDP and employment.Keynes’s approach was a direct challenge to classical economists’ belief thatmarket economies were always self-correcting and would, when disturbed, returnto full employment in relatively short order. By contrast, Keynes argued thatthere were circumstances in which those self-equilibrating mechanisms becamedysfunctional, creating an “underemployment equilibrium.” In thosecircumstances, he advocated government deficit spending to offset shortfalls inaggregate demand. Remarkably, more than seventy-five years later, economistscontinue to debate the pros and cons of that policy.Economic forecasting of all varieties, Keynesian and otherwise, has always beenfraught with never-ending challenges. Models, by their nature, are vastsimplifications of a complex economic reality. There are literally millions ofrelationships that interact every day to create aggregate GDP, even for arelatively simple market economy. Because only a very small fraction of theseinteractions can be represented in any model, economists are continually seekingsets of equations that, while few in number, nonetheless are presumed to capturethe fundamental forces that drive modern economies.In practice, model builders (myself included) keep altering the set of chosenvariables and equation specifications until we get a result that appears toreplicate the historical record in an economically credible manner. Everyforecaster must decide which relative handful of “equations” he or she believesmost effectively captures the essence of an economy’s overall dynamics.For the most part, the modeling of the nonfinancial sectors of market economieshas worked tolerably well. Vast amounts of research have increasingly enhancedour understanding of how those markets function.3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber2] Finance, however, as werepeatedly learn, operates in a different leveraged environment where risk is ofa significantly larger magnitude than in the rest of the economy. Risk takingand avoiding is at the root of almost all financial decisions. Nonfinancialbusiness is more oriented to engineering, technology, and managementorganization.Nonfinancial businesses do factor risk into all their capital investment andother decisions, but their principal concern concentrates on, for example, howmany transistors can be squeezed onto a microchip and how to ensure bridges cansafely carry the traffic load they are built to carry. But that is theapplication of quantum mechanics and engineering, where risk has been largely,though not wholly, removed from decision making. Synthetic derivative tradingand other new activities in our financial sector have levels of risk manymultiples greater than exist in the physical sciences, the critical body ofknowledge that supports nonfinancial business. Human nature has no role to playin how subatomic particles interact with one another.4[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber3] Our propensities related tofear, euphoria, herding, and culture, however, virtually define finance. Becausefinance importantly guides a nation’s savings toward investment in cutting-edgetechnologies, its impact on overall economic outcomes, for good or ill, is fargreater than its less than 10 percent share of GDP would suggest. Moreover,financial imbalances are doubtless the major cause, directly or indirectly, ofmodern business cycles. Finance has always been the most difficult component ofan economy to model.Spurred in the 1960s by the apparent success of the forecasting models of theCouncil of Economic Advisers (CEA) under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson,econometrics, as it came to be known, moved from the classroom to the forefrontof economic policy making. By the late 1960s, econometric models had become anintegral part of government and private policy making, and remain so to thisday.But the road forward for forecasters has been rocky. Simple models do well inthe classroom as tutorials, but regrettably have had less success in the worldbeyond. No sooner had Keynes’s paradigm gained wide acceptance within theeconomics profession than the American economy began to behave in a manner thatcontradicted some of the core tenets of the so-called Keynesian models,including the thesis that a rise in unemployment reflected increased slack inthe economy that would in turn lower the rate of inflation. For much of the1970s, the unemployment rate rose, but the inflation rate remained stubbornlyelevated—a malady dubbed stagflation at the time.The forecasting tools that had made government economists seem so prescient adecade earlier now appeared flawed. Milton Friedman of the University of Chicagogained intellectual traction by arguing that our inflationary economic policies,most notably the rapid expansion of the money supply, were raising inflationexpectations that overcame the disinflationary effect of slack in the labormarket. Friedman and his followers developed a theory, monetarism, and aforecasting tool based on the growth in money supply that, for a while, appearedto forecast the developments of the late 1970s far more accurately than any ofthe variations of the Keynesian model. By the end of the 1970s, the weeklyissuance by the Federal Reserve of its money supply figures soon drew as muchattention as today’s unemployment numbers.By the 1980s, with inflation under control—thanks, in part, to the FederalReserve’s restraint of money supply growth—a rejuvenated but somewhat chastenedKeynesianism, with a stagflation fix to reflect the importance of inflationexpectations, reemerged. Such models worked reasonably well for the next twodecades, largely as a consequence of an absence of any serious structuralbreakdown in markets. The model constructed by Federal Reserve staff, combiningthe elements of Keynesianism, monetarism, and other more recent contributions toeconomic theory, seemed particularly impressive, and was particularly helpful tothe Fed’s Board of Governors over the years of my tenure.THE WORLD CHANGEDBut leading up to the almost universally unanticipated crisis of September 2008,macromodeling unequivocally failed when it was needed most, much to the chagrinof the economics profession. The Federal Reserve Board’s highly sophisticatedforecasting system did not foresee a recession until the crisis hit. Nor did themodel developed by the prestigious International Monetary Fund, which concludedas late as the spring of 2007 that “global economic risks [have] declinedsince . . . September 2006. . . . The overall U.S. economy is holding upwell . . . [and] the signs elsewhere are very encouraging.”5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber4] JPMorgan, arguablyAmerica’s premier financial institution, projected on September 12, 2008—threedays before the crisis hit—that the U.S. GDP growth rate would be acceleratinginto the first half of 2009.Most analysts and forecasters, both public and private, agreed with the viewexpressed by the Economist in December 2006 that “market capitalism, the enginethat runs most of the world economy, seems to be doing its job well.” As late asthe day before the crash, September 14, 2008, the outlook was still sufficientlyequivocal that I was asked on ABC’s Sunday morning show This Week if “thechances of escaping a recession [were] greater than fifty percent.”6[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber5] With the crisis less thantwenty-four hours away, conventional wisdom had not yet coalesced around eventhe possibility of a typical recession, to say nothing of the worst economiccrisis in eight decades.Moreover, even after the crash, in January 2009, the unemployment rate, then at7.8 percent, was forecast by the chairman designate of the President’s Councilof Economic Advisers to fall to 7.0 percent by the end of 2010 and to 6.5percent by the end of 2011.7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber6] In December 2011, the ratewas 8.5 percent.What went wrong? Why was virtually every economist and policy maker of note sooff about so large an issue?My inquiry begins with an examination of “animal spirits,” the term John MaynardKeynes famously coined to refer to “a spontaneous urge to action rather thaninaction, and not as the [rational] outcome of a weighted average ofquantitative benefits multiplied by quantitative probabilities.”8[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber7] Keynes was talking aboutthe spirit that impels economic activity, but we now amend his notion of animalspirits to include its obverse, fear-driven risk aversion. I had long been awareof such “spirits” and their quirkiness; in 1959, as a young economist, I had myfirst taste of being impressively wrong in a public prediction when I worried inthe pages of Fortune magazine of investors’ “over-exuberance” at what wouldprove to be very far from the top of a roaring bull market.9[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber8], 10[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber9] The point isn’t that I andother economic forecasters didn’t understand that markets are prone to wild andeven deranging mood swings that are uncoupled from any underlying rationalbasis. The point is rather that such “irrational” behavior is hard to measure,and stubbornly resistant to any reliable systematic analysis.But now, after the past several years of closely studying the manifestations ofanimal spirits during times of severe crisis, I have come around to the viewthat there is something more systematic about the way people behaveirrationally, especially during periods of extreme economic stress, than I hadpreviously contemplated. In other words, this behavior can be measured and madean integral part of the economic forecasting process and the formulation ofeconomic policy.In a change of my perspective, I have recently come to appreciate that “spirits”do in fact display “consistencies” that can importantly enhance our ability toidentify emerging asset price bubbles in equities, commodities, and exchangerates—and even to anticipate the economic consequences of their ultimatecollapse and recovery.In Chapter 1 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-6.xhtml] in particular, I seek toidentify specific behavioral imperatives—spirits—such as euphoria, fear, panic,optimism, and many more—and explore how they, and the cultures they foster,interact with rational economic behavior and spur important market outcomes.This isn’t to say that we should throw Homo economicus out with his dirtybathwater: Despite ample evidence of persistent irrational market behavior, thedata indicate that over the long run, rational economic judgments still guidefree economies. But, of course, the long run can, famously, take a very longtime.Nonetheless, it is essential to take both a long-term and a short-termperspective when we examine the roots of the 2008 crisis and the tepid recoverythat followed. The rise and fall from 1994 to 2008 of two asset price bubbles,the data indicate, did reflect in part real improvements in productivity, butthe bubbles were also carried by a wave of irrational exuberance and bubbleeuphoria. Those waves, when they inevitably collapsed, produced widespread fearthat disabled markets.It is important to recognize, however, that not all bubbles, when they collapse,wreak the degree of havoc experienced in 2008. As I detail in Chapter 2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-7.xhtml], the crashes of 1987 and 2000 hadcomparatively minimal negative effect on the economy. The severity of thedestruction caused by a bursting bubble is determined not by the type of assetthat turns “toxic” but by the degree of leverage employed by the holders ofthose toxic assets. The latter condition dictates to what extent contagionbecomes destabilizing. In short, debt leverage matters—as we see in Chapter 2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-7.xhtml].—This book touches on many related issues of importance to our economic future.Writing it has taken me into some uncharted waters—some that might, because ofthe nature of some of my concerns about the course we are now on, prove to beuncomfortably warm. But I did not write this book in a spirit of criticism, orof pessimism. My interest in writing it was not to establish what I now thinkbut what I now believe I can demonstrate with some reasonable degree ofassurance.Coming out of World War II, the United States was at the top of its game.Productivity was growing rapidly. Household and business savings rates wereclose to 10 percent, and capital investment and residential building werebooming. Moreover, even after funding our burgeoning capital investment, westill had enough savings to spare to invest beyond our borders.After securing our place of leadership in the economic world, we turnedmagnanimously to ensure that the least well off in our society shared in thegood fortune of the nation as a whole. After many years of Social Security andlesser programs, such “government social benefits to persons” totaled 4.7percent of GDP. But starting in 1965, with the additions of Medicare andMedicaid, and shortly thereafter a major increase in Social Security throughbenefit inflation indexation, we embarked on a truly bipartisan unprecedentedfour-decade rise in outlays averaging nearly 10 percent per year. Theunfortunate consequence of our magnanimity, as I demonstrate in later chapters,is that these benefits have been crowding out private savings almost dollar fordollar. That loss of funding for capital investment led to slowed productivitygrowth, a phenomenon that would have been even worse if we had not turned toborrowing so heavily from abroad. Moreover, to fund our generosity we haveforaged into every corner of our federal budget to meet the rise in socialbenefit spending. We are eating our seed corn, and damaging the very engine ofAmerica’s comparative strength in the world. We desperately need a change indirection. We have done it before—many times, in fact.A NOTE TO READERSWhere applicable in the chapters that follow, I have included appendices insupport of my conclusions, with additional explanatory text, tables, charts, andregression analyses, the most widely used statistical procedure to assist injudging economic cause and effect.11[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber10] Statistics first appear inChapter 2 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-7.xhtml] and I have accompanied thatchapter’s appendix with a short primer on the interpretation of the results ofregression analysis. For those uninterested in these metrics, appendices canreadily be bypassed. I trust my written commentary will carry the line ofreasoning of the appendices’ equations.A significant part of the statistical analysis in our exhibits rests on theNational Income and Product Accounts of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).Shortly before we went to press, the BEA published a major revision of thoseaccounts. While there are significant changes in the levels of many series, noneimportantly alter any conclusions in the forthcoming chapters."},{"pageContent":"ONEANIMAL SPIRITSIn my early years, I lived a cloistered life, traveling only rarely outside theconfines of New York City. When, in my mid-to-late teens, I was first exposed tothe rest of the world, I was amazed at how similarly all varieties of peoplebehaved. They may have hailed from different cultures and spoken differentlanguages, but their interactions and behavior were quite familiar to a boybrought up in the canyons of New York City. As I began to travel widely, Ibecame fascinated when businesspeople in Norway, tribal leaders in South Africa,and Chinese musicians all had remarkably similar emotional reactions today-to-day events. They all smiled and laughed, for example, as a sign ofpleasure. They all expressed fear and euphoria in a similar manner.As the years rolled on, I observed generation after generation of teenagers allexhibiting similar insecurities, awkwardness, and aspirations. The novels ofJane Austen, written in early nineteenth-century Britain, depicted to me aplaying field of social intercourse quite familiar to everyone alive today. Wehumans appear to be a truly homogenous species.But at root, what are we? We like to describe ourselves as fundamentally drivenby reason to an extent not matched by other living creatures. This is doubtlesstrue. But we are far from the prototype depicted by neoclassical economists:that of people motivated predominantly by considerations of rational long-termself-interest. Our thinking process, as behavioral economists point out, is moreintuitive than syllogistic. In the end, of course, all intellectual and hencematerial progress requires verification by a systematic logical process, butthat is rarely the way we think day by day.The economics of animal spirits, broadly speaking, covers a wide range of humanactions, and overlaps with much of the relatively new discipline of behavioraleconomics. The point is to substitute a more realistic version of behavior thanthe model of the wholly rationality-driven “economic man” so prominent for solong in economics courses taught in our universities.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber11] This more realistic viewof the way people behave in their day-by-day activities in the marketplacetraces a path of economic growth that is somewhat lower than would be the caseif people were truly “rational” economic actors. Most of the time this issue isof little more than academic interest because all of our statisticalobservations and forecasts are already based on decisions that people actuallymade, not what those decisions would have been had people been acting morerationally. While it’s true that if people acted at the level of rationalitypresumed in the standard economics textbooks I was brought up with, the world’sstandard of living would be measurably higher; but, in fact, they do not. Fromthe perspective of a forecaster, the issue is thus not whether behavior isrational but whether it is sufficiently repetitive and systematic to benumerically measured and predicted.Can we better identify and measure those quick-reaction judgments on which wetend to base much, if not all, of our rapid-fire financial market and relateddecisions—“fast thinking,” in the words of Daniel Kahneman, a leading behavioraleconomist? I think so.THE LONGER PERSPECTIVEConsider the insights that brought us the steam engine and the electric motor,the railroad, the telegraph, atomic energy, and the integrated circuit. It wasthose innovations, and more, that over the past two centuries propelledcivilization to the highest material standards of living ever achieved. Theywere all the result of human reasoning. As the seventeenth-century Frenchmathematician Blaise Pascal is said to have put it, “Man’s greatness lies in hispower of thought.” It’s Kahneman’s “slow thinking.”To be sure, great innovators often explain their insights as epiphanies, orintuition. But those epiphanies seem to happen only to those who havelaboriously accumulated the knowledge relevant to such awakenings.2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber12] I rank the revolution ofthe eighteenth century, the Enlightenment, particularly in the works of JohnLocke, David Hume, Adam Smith, and their followers, as the critical intellectualroot of the twenty-first century’s elevated standard of living. The radicalideas of such men led to the political upheaval that changed societiespreviously ruled by the divine right of kings, often in complicity with theChurch. Many countries reorganized under a rule of law that protected individualrights, especially property rights. By engaging our competitive self-interest,we fostered the innovations that changed the world after millennia of economicstagnation. Those were all acts of human intelligence from which the historicalroots of modern capitalist economies have arisen. But that human intelligencehas always existed side by side with a large strain of human irrationality.As the nineteenth century progressed and populations moved from self-sufficientfarming to the increasingly complex and interactive urban-dominated economies ofthe modern world, the industrial business cycle emerged. It demonstrably wasdriven by the animal spirits we currently observe at the core of speculativebooms. But because agriculture, diminishing in importance but still prominentinto the 1950s, was largely dependent on weather rather than animal spirits, itwas out of sync with the business cycle of nonagricultural industries and thusassuaged the ebb and flow of economic activity as a whole.On occasion in this book I try to supplement standard forecasting models tocapture what we have always known about financial market disruption but havenever integrated into those models. As I mentioned, I had always viewed animalspirits as the human propensities driven largely by random irrationalities notreadily integrated into formal models of the way market economies function.September 2008 was a watershed moment for forecasters, myself included. It hasforced us to find ways to incorporate into our macromodels those animal spiritsthat dominate finance.All such spirits, as I observe later, are tempered by reason to a greater orlesser degree, and hence I more formally choose to describe such marketplacebehavior as “propensities.” The technologies that have driven productivity sincethe Enlightenment were, at root, reasoned insights. Random irrationalityproduces nothing. If reason were not ultimately prevailing, we could not explainthe dramatic improvements in standards of living that the world has achieved inthe past two centuries.As I will demonstrate, these reason-tempered animal spirits significantly affectmacroeconomic decision making and outcomes. Newly popular behavioral economicsis forcing forecasters to evaluate economic data in the context of a morecomplex model than that to which most of us had become accustomed.BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICSBehavioral economics is not a substitute for conventional economics, nor is itclaimed to be. Daniel Kahneman, in discussing his latest book, noted that “muchof the discussion . . . is about biases of intuition. However, the focus onerror does not denigrate human intelligence. . . . Most of our judgments andactions are appropriate most of the time.”3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber13]As Colin Camerer and George Loewenstein aptly put it a decade ago:At the core of behavioral economics is the conviction that increasing therealism of the psychological underpinnings of economic analysis will improveeconomics on its own terms. . . . It does not imply a wholesale rejection of theneoclassical approach to economics based on utility maximization, equilibrium,and efficiency. . . . [Behavioral] departures are not radical . . . because theyrelax simplifying assumptions that are not central to the economic approach. Forexample, there is nothing in core neoclassical theory that specifies that peopleshould . . . weight risky outcomes in a linear fashion, or that they mustdiscount the future exponentially at a constant rate.4[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber14]IDENTIFICATIONBecause human beings demonstrate similar characteristics, most, if not all,inbred propensities can be inferred by introspection and observation by everyone of us. Fear, euphoria, competitive drive, and time preference, for example,are both introspectively self-evident and readily recognizable in others. Otherpropensities, such as inbred herding and home bias, we infer mainly by observingthe behavior of others. (All of these separate propensities will be discussedshortly.)In classifying propensities, I do not pretend to know which are truly inbred andwhich just have statistical regularities that are tantamount to being inbred. Iclassify propensities as “inbred”—herd behavior, for example—more forconvenience than insight. I use the term “inbred” to cover both truly inbredpropensities and those consistencies of behavior that enable model builders tooperate on that assumption. I do not contend to have covered all of theeconomically relevant spirits or propensities, but I do hope that I haveaddressed the most important of them. My ultimate purpose is defining a set ofeconomic stabilities of human actions that are statistically measurable andhence capable of being modeled. I am fully aware that in the process I amdelving into disciplines with which I have little experience, and have tried totemper my conclusions accordingly.PROPENSITIESFear and EuphoriaWe all directly experience threats to our self and our values (fear) and thesense of well-being or elation (euphoria) triggered in the course of our pursuitof our economic interests. Fear, a major component of animal spirits, is aresponse to a threat to life, limb, and net worth. That emotion is decidedlyinbred—no one is immune to it. But people respond to fear in different ways, andthe differences are part of what defines the individuality of people. We are allalike fundamentally, but it is our individuality that makes for differences invalues and our position in the hierarchy of society. Moreover, it is ourindividuality that creates markets, division of labor, and economic activity aswe know it.Risk AversionRisk aversion is a complex animal spirit crucial to forecasting. It reflects theambivalent attitude people exhibit to the taking of risk. That we need to act toobtain food, shelter, and all the necessities of life is evident to all, as isthe fact that we can’t necessarily know in advance how successful our actionswill be. The process of choosing which risks to take and which to avoiddetermines the relative pricing structure of markets, which in turn guides theflow of savings into investment, the critical function of finance (an issue Iaddress in Chapter 5 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-10.xhtml]).If risk taking is essential to living, is more risk taking better than less? Ifmore risk were better than less risk, demand for lower quality bonds wouldexceed demand for riskless bonds, and high-quality bonds would yield more thanlow-quality bonds. They do not, from which we can infer the obvious: Risk takingis a necessary part of living, but it is not something the vast majority of usactively seek. Finding the proper balance of risks is critical to all of us inour day-to-day lives and perhaps manifests itself most obviously in finance inthe management of portfolio risk.The extremes of zero and full risk aversion (or its obverse, full and zero risktaking) are outside all human experience. Zero risk aversion—that is, theabsence of any aversion to engaging in risky actions—implies that an individualdoes not care about, or cannot discriminate among, objective states of risk tolife and limb. Such individuals cannot (or do not choose to) recognizelife-threatening events. But to acquire the staples of life requires action,that is, the taking of risks, either by an individual or by others, such asparents taking risks on a child’s behalf.We live our lives day by day well within these outer boundaries of risk aversionand risk taking, which can be measured approximately by financial market yieldspreads with respect to both credit rating and maturity. Those boundaries arecritical to forecasting. The turn in stock prices in early 2009 following thecrash of 2008 was a sign of the level of human angst approaching its historicallimit (see Chapter 4 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-9.xhtml]). The limits of angstare also evident in credit spreads, which exhibit few or no long-term historicaltrends. Prime railroad bonds of the immediate post‒Civil War years, for example,reflect spreads over U.S. Treasuries that are similar to our post‒World War IIexperience, suggesting long-term stability in the degree and spread of humanrisk aversion.I calibrate how people respond to risk in nonfinancial markets, both rationallyand emotionally, with a measure I have employed for years—the share of liquidcash flow that management chooses to commit to illiquid, especially long-term,capital investments. That share is a measure of corporate managers’ degree ofuncertainty and hence their willingness to take risks. In 2009, it had fallen toits lowest peacetime level since 1938. The equivalent measure of risk aversionfor households is the share of household cash flow invested in homes. Thismeasure reached its lowest postwar level in 2010. That collapse in investment,especially in long-lived assets, explains most of the recent failure of theAmerican economy to follow a path of recovery similar to the other tenpost‒World War II recoveries (see Chapter 7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-12.xhtml], “Uncertainty Undermines Investment”).Throughout this book I delve into the role of risk aversion and uncertainty ascritical determinants of economic activity. I conclude that stock prices are notonly an official leading indicator of business activity but are also a majorcause of that activity (see Chapter 4 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-9.xhtml]).Uncertainty has many of the characteristics of peering into fog. Heavydiscounting of the future is tantamount to having difficulty perceiving clearlybeyond a certain point, and progressively less well as distance (risk)increases. The lessening or the end of uncertainty is like the lifting of thefog.Time PreferenceTime preference is the self-evident propensity to value more highly a claim toan asset today than a claim to that same asset at some fixed time in the future.A promise delivered tomorrow is not as valuable as that promise conveyed today.That many buyers of Apple’s immensely popular iPhone 5 (released in September2012) would have paid for immediate delivery to bypass a waiting list is a clearreflection of time preference. We experience this phenomenon mainly through itsmost visible counterpart: interest rates and savings rates (see Box 1.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-6.xhtml#box_1_1]). The stability of time preferenceover the generations can be demonstrated; indeed, in fifth-century-BC Greece,interest rates exhibited levels similar to what we see in today’s markets.5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber15] The Bank of England’sofficial policy rate for the years 1694 to 1972 ranged between 2 percent and 10percent. It surged to 17 percent during the inflationary late 1970s, but it hassince returned to its single-digit historical range. It is reasonable toconclude that time preference, too, has no evident long-term trend.Such inferences of the stability of time preference are also consistent withbehavioral economics. A famous experiment, conducted in 1972 and 1990 byStanford psychologist Walter Mischel, concluded that the ability of childrenbetween the ages of four and six to forgo immediate gratification6[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber16] was reflected years laterby the high SAT scores of those who deferred gratification as children comparedwith those who could not. A follow-up study of the same individuals in 2011confirmed the response, indicating a lifelong inbred propensity to a specificlevel of time preference, though not the same for each individual. To forgoshort-term gratification for greater rewards in the future is generallyconsistent with higher intelligence.Real (inflation expectation adjusted) market interest rates, I assume, arecontinually converging toward a stable time preference, though we cannot be surebecause time preference is rarely directly visible.BOX 1.1: TIME PREFERENCE AND SAVINGSThe extent that we discount the future (time preference) must obviously affectour saving propensity. A high preference for immediate consumption woulddiminish the propensity to save while a high preference for saving forretirement, for example, would diminish the propensity to consume. But throughmost of history, time preference could not have had a major determining role inthe level of savings. Prior to the late nineteenth century, almost allproduction had to be dedicated to keeping the population alive. There was littleto save even if our inbred propensities were inclined in that direction.Western Europe’s population, for example, was able to grow only 0.2 percentannually between 1000 and 1820, following stagnation in the previousmillennium.* [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-6_fn1.xhtml#footnote-1443-1] It is onlywhen innovation and productivity growth freed generations from the grip ofchronic starvation that time preference could emerge as a significant economicforce. Since 1880, the gross private savings rate in the United States has beenremarkably stable, ranging mostly between 10 and 20 percent of GDP. Grossdomestic savings averaged somewhat higher, and as can be seen from Exhibit 9.5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_9_5], the savings rate rose sharplyafter 1834.Savings is a measure of the extent of abstaining from consumption. Investment isa measure of the particular assets to which those savings are applied. Savingsand investment, as I note in Box 9.3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-14.xhtml#box_9_3], are alternate measures of thesame transactions, ex post.Culture reflects a country’s degree of abstinence. People acting rationallywould tend to save in their early years to create provisions for years ofretirement. (“Retirement,” incidentally, is only a twentieth-centuryphenomenon.) But our less rational propensities are too often evident in afailure to always do so.What is remarkable is how, in the United States, we have managed to exhibit sostable a private savings rate for more than a century. Time preference, judgingfrom the historical data on the long stability of real riskless interest rates,apparently remained stable, and doubtless sets the upper limits to theproportion of income that people are willing to save, if they are able to do soat all. It has only been when human ingenuity brought production levels beyondthe needs of raw survival that time preference became a factor in the rate ofsavings.Herd BehaviorThere is a universally observed human trait to follow or emulate a leader ofsome sort. It is driven by most people’s need to achieve the security (emotionaland physical) of belonging to a group. It is arguably one of our most importantpropensities, second only to fear, and a significant driver of economicactivity. Herd behavior exaggerates speculation and the business cycle as itdistracts us from the facts of markets and draws us to the less relevant viewsof other people. It captures consumer behavior known by the idiom “keeping upwith the Joneses,” also known as “conspicuous consumption,” the term coined byThorstein Veblen in 1899.7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber17], 8[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber18]I would argue that this behavior accounts for the long-term stability we see inhousehold spending and saving patterns from one generation to the next. Personalsavings as a share of disposable personal income during peacetime has held in arelatively narrow range of 5 percent to 10 percent almost all of the time since1897 (see Exhibit 1.1 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_1_1]). Withthe very large rise in average real household incomes over the generations, whydoes the average savings rate not rise as a consequence? As I noted in The Ageof Turbulence (pages 269–70), happiness depends far more on how people’s incomescompare with those of their perceived peers, or even those of their role models,than how they are doing in any absolute material sense. When graduate studentsat Harvard were asked awhile back whether they would be happier with $50,000 ayear if their peers earned half that, or $100,000 if their peers doubled that,the majority chose the lower salary. When I first saw the story, I chuckled andstarted to brush it off. But it struck a chord, and ultimately brought back along-dormant memory of a fascinating 1947 study by Dorothy Brady and RoseFriedman.9 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber19]Brady and Friedman presented data that showed that the share of income anAmerican family spends on consumer goods and services is largely determined notby the level of family income but by its level relative to the nation’s averagefamily income. Their study suggests that a family with the nation’s averageincome in 2000 would be expected to spend the same proportion of its income as afamily with average family income in 1900, even though in inflation-adjustedterms that 1900 income was only a minor fraction of that of 2000. I reproducedand updated their calculations and confirmed their conclusion.10[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber20] Consumer behavior has notmuch changed over the last century and a quarter.Herding is a different type of propensity from all the rest in that it refersnot only to individuals’ copycat propensity but also to the principles of groupbehavior and thus has implications for the economy overall. Fear and euphoria,for example, are contagious processes exaggerated by herding.11[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber21] It can be difficult toparse, however, why individuals seek to emulate one group rather than anotherand what it takes to wean them away from one “crowd” to join another. Theemergence of modern social media has only accelerated herd behavior.Herd behavior is a key driver and an essential characteristic of speculativebooms and busts. Once the speculative herd-driven propensity arrives at a statein which the vast majority of market participants have become committed to thebull market, the market becomes highly vulnerable to what I dub the Jesselparadox (see Chapter 3 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-8.xhtml]), and the marketbreaks. While the Jessel paradox explains the upside of speculative booms, ananalogy to how the downside plays out, both literally and figuratively, is theextreme form of herding, the dreaded stampede—a term borrowed from the cattledrives of our Old West.Dealing with day-to-day reality requires a level of detailed decision makingthat most adults, to a greater or lesser extent, perceive as beyond their ken.12[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber22] For most of us, thecomfort of guidance is sought in religion, and all of us are drawn to followingthe directions or emulating the actions of our peers or leaders.Those who believe, rightly or wrongly, that they know the direction that theirsociety should take compete for leadership. Cliques or political parties arise,from which the ultimate leaders emerge, sometimes by grasping the levers ofmilitary power. In democratic societies at least, who the leaders turn out tobe, for good or ill, is heavily influenced by herd behavior.Few if any social groups have flourished without some hierarchy of leadership.Communal groups that make collective decisions by strict consensus—especiallythose attempting to live communally to the extent of holding income and wealthin common—almost always collapse. People have a propensity to form emotionalbonds to a larger group, but when these bonds demand an equal sharing of incomeor status in a pecking order, they tend to break down, floundering on the inbredself-centered nature of our species. Our propensity for competition invariablyproduces the jockeying for leadership that has persistently undermined communalsocieties.People in every society seek to improve their status in the pecking order of anyorganization. Even those who deem themselves unaffected by the opinions ofothers conform to the customs and culture of their societies. Albert Einstein,for example, however intellectually self-generating, followed many of the socialnorms of his day. Ayn Rand, the most independent person I have ever known,followed many of the trivial dress customs of her society.DependencyOur sense of mutual dependency leads us to search for the companionship andapproval of people we perceive as our peers. Instead of living asself-sufficient hermits, people almost universally choose to live in groups andgain from companionship and a division of labor.13[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber23] And, of course, if we didnot harbor an inbred biological imperative to procreate, none of us would behere. But a sense of dependency by definition places “dependents” in a constantstate of uncertainty. To assuage the uncertainty, people’s inbred sense ofself-worth asserts itself and we challenge authority. Our nature also requiresus to seek a measure of independence. Dependency in one form or another is anecessary but not necessarily a pleasurable state. Children under therestrictive guidance of elders often revolt against parental apron strings. Manychildren, at one time or another, in extremis, leave home in an assertion ofindependence, only to return when the reality of their dependence becomes alltoo real.The InteractionTime preference, coupled with risk aversion and herd behavior, governs thepricing of all income-producing assets and, since the nineteenth century, setsthe proportion of income that households seek to save over the long run. Thereal (inflation-adjusted) interest rate is anchored by time preference, and itfluctuates according to the balance of saving and investment in an economy andthe degree of financial intermediation. Bond yields measure risk aversion in twodimensions: by credit rating and maturity. Herd behavior will often skew anindividual’s risk aversion judgment toward the mean of a group: other investors,family, or pundits. Stock prices can be thought of as the sum of the expectedfuture earnings per share, tempered by a rate of discount applied to thoseearnings. That discount rate is the rate of return that investors require tohold such risky assets. The equity premium is the rate of return that investorsexpect, less the real rate of return on riskless assets, a proxy for timepreference. The capitalization of rental returns on real estate properties issimilarly calculated.Home BiasHome bias is the propensity to deal with the familiar: with people and thingsgeographically close to home and familiar in terms of culture, language, andinterests. This is especially evident in trade data, both foreign and domestic,even allowing for savings in transportation costs. Canada and Mexico, forexample, accounted for 29 percent of our total international trade in 2011, farmore than their share of global non–U.S. GDP. And my family’s favorite pharmacysells the vast majority of its wares to patrons who live within a mile of itslocation.Aside from any direct or indirect barriers, people seem to prefer to invest infamiliar local businesses. The United States has no barriers to interstateinvestment, and the states share a common currency, culture, language, and legalsystem. Yet studies have shown that individual investors and even professionalmoney managers have a slight preference for investments in their own communitiesand states. Trust, so crucial an aspect of investing, is most likely to befostered by the familiarity of local communities.A propensity related to the comfort and familiarity of trading with partnersclose to home is the emotional comfort we all sense in personal relationshipsthat become familiar and predictable. The uncertainty that arises with strangersimparts a certain, if minor, stress that subsides with familiarity. Personalrelationships that build over months and years are a major reason why peopleborn and brought up in a particular locale tend to stay put, often for alifetime, even when they have accumulated the physical resources to moveelsewhere and have ample reason to do so. The familiarity of home is the sourceof the angst we feel after leaving, namely homesickness.CompetitionMore complex, and battling with our sense of dependency, is our introspectivelyself-evident propensity to be competitive. Its consequences range over a muchbroader spectrum than most propensities. Competition as it plays out in marketsis, of course, indispensable to the efficient functioning of our economies, ashas been emphasized by economists for more than two centuries. The degree ofcompetitiveness has a broad sway in defining our culture and its indirect effecton economic events.We compete whether on a ball field or during a dinner conversation. When we viewa familiar competitive sport, even though we may begin by having no preferencefor either competitor, we usually find ourselves rooting within a matter ofminutes for one or the other. If not, we lose interest. It is our nature. Andwhen we combine this propensity with copycat herd behavior and our home biaspropensity, we develop overwhelming support for local teams against “foreign”competitors. Spectator sports are effectively morality plays: stylized views ofthe type of competition in which we all engage in our day-to-day activities withrespect to both economic and noneconomic relationships. The specific spectatorsport is irrelevant—all that is required is that there is competitive “combat”and that there are winners and losers to gain our attention.I suspect, but cannot prove, that this propensity is driven by the fact thatcompetition is, in a Darwinian sense, necessary for survival. Unless wesuccessfully compete in the taking of risk, we perish. War appears to be an uglyextension of this propensity. War is competition raised to a level of mortalcombat in which there are ultimate winners and losers. Since war has been a partof the human condition as far back as history allows, I assume this propensityis inbred. This is one of many ambivalences that arise with animal spirits.Code of ValuesNo human being can avoid the imperative of judging right from wrong. What wefeel is right and just reflects our own deep-seated code of values. Werationally codify our introspective view of how our actions will further ourvalues and, therefore, what set of actions we believe, rightly or wrongly, willnurture our lives. The value systems of most people are rooted in religion andculture and are heavily inculcated at an early age by our parents and, later inlife, by our peers.What is perceived by people as right or wrong is not preordained and requiresthat each of us fill in the blanks by drawing on our own value systems. Herdbehavior, not surprisingly, is apparently a major factor in individuals’choices, and people’s value hierarchy can and does change over time. Moreover,we cannot help applying our own standards to judge the actions of others.This propensity is the source of our sense of “fairness” in economic matters.Most people act as though a particular sense of fairness is self-evident. It isnot. It is rather one’s most deeply imbedded hierarchy of values that mostpeople have difficulty expressing, or even identifying in some instances. Mostcommentators take it as self-evident that taxing the wealthy at a higher ratethan lower income groups is “fairer.” But that implies that somehow upper incometaxpayers have not “earned” their income, a view that rests on the belief thatin a division of labor of society, all income is produced jointly. The alternateview is that even though output is produced collectively in a free, competitivemarket, each individual’s income reflects that person’s marginal contribution tototal output. Either view can be, and has been, rationally held, but neither canclaim self-evidence. “Ability to pay” is a pragmatic view that also rests on thepremise that income is not “earned.”Most people in a society or country tend to hold similar standards of fairness.This, in democratic societies, ultimately determines what is legally “just,” thebasis of our set of laws. Such fundamental beliefs are the major glue that holdssocieties together. In the United States, for example, the pact with respect topublic issues is our Constitution. We are governed by a rule of law anchored bythe protection of those “fundamental” individual rights. That constitution hasexisted with relatively few amendments since 1789. But that stability in thegoverning law of our land has periodically come under strain over thegenerations and indeed broke down on the set of issues, slavery first amongthem, that led to the Civil War. That the break did not come sooner issurprising given the inherent contradiction between the Declaration ofIndependence’s assertion that “all men are created equal” and the existence ofslavery.OptimismAnother propensity is people’s bias toward optimism rather than realism—apropensity to assume that success in all actions is more likely than theobjective probabilities. We wouldn’t take risks if we were certain of failure.The mentality behind widespread gambling, for example, is that one can beat theodds, even as they are objectively stacked against us. This is especially thecase in a lottery where pure chance prevails. As Kahneman observed, “We alsotend to exaggerate our ability to forecast the future, which fosters optimisticoverconfidence. In terms of its consequences for decisions, the optimistic biasmay well be the most significant of the cognitive biases.”14[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber24] Of greater economicrelevance, the propensity toward “hope” encourages entrepreneurial initiatives.That probably assures greater successes, but certainly more failures as well.Bias to Value RelativesThe evidence is unequivocal that people have an inbred propensity to valuerelatives, especially children, over others. This perpetuates the concentrationof inherited wealth and the distribution of income from one generation to thenext.Self-interestWe direct our actions to achieve those values, material and otherwise, that arerequired by our nature to survive and thrive. If we fail, we perish. In therealm of economics, the vast majority of our actions are driven by self-interestrelative to the interests of others. If self-interest were not the primarydeterminant in economic activity, how do we explain the universal evidence thatdemand curves have downward slopes and supply curves trend upward—that is, thatbuyers will buy more and suppliers will supply less if prices fall? It is that,plus its obverse, that creates uniquely determined prices in all types ofmarkets. Upward-sloping demand curves are a rare phenomenon.15[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber25] Profit as a motivenecessarily narrows choice. But even here there are trade-offs that pitlong-term benefits against immediate gratification. All human beings harbor aninbred propensity to value human life. Even though there are clearlyqualifications, that inbred propensity is the source of our feelings of empathy,charity, and in extreme cases, self-sacrifice. This is also the motive behind afather risking his own life to rescue his drowning child. Thus, much beyondnarrowly focused economic self-interest has significant economic implications.In crisis, we seek to help one another as we all seek a common outcome. We sawsuch behavior in the London blitz of 1940 and, more recently, in Boston afterthe horror of the Boston Marathon bombings.Self-esteemAll human motivation appears to have a basis in our never-ending quest toachieve self-esteem. Self-esteem is an inbuilt human requirement, and one thatdemands continued nurturing—almost all human actions in one form or another arearguably directed at bolstering self-esteem. Mark Twain put it lessstentoriously: “A man cannot be comfortable without his own approval.” Peopleperpetually seek a reaffirmation of self-worth, often through the approval ofothers and the gratitude of those whom we have assisted. Unless our self-esteemis nurtured, most of us fall into depression.PROPENSITIES: PLUSES AND MINUSESSome of our human propensities have both positive and negative effects oneconomic activity. On the positive side, an inbred propensity to compete engagesthe forces of self-interest and self-esteem that direct resources to theirhighest valued uses, as judged by the value preferences, on average, of asociety as a whole. And copycat herd behavior shapes trends for goods andservices that spread improvements in our quality of life. The herd propensityleads to enhanced mass production and lower real unit costs of many consumergoods and services (as well as copycat capital investments), all supportinggrowth of productivity and living standards. On the negative side,competitiveness at its extreme, as I noted earlier, can morph into ugliness, andeven violence.RATIONALITYMost human responses to daily economic events fall into the category ofintuitive or “fast” thinking. These so-called knee-jerk decisions arise from theway our mind detects familiar patterns in new situations. A virtuallyinstantaneous first cut of analysis yields the conclusions that come to usintuitively without having to access their sources. Given time and consciousappraisal, we often revise our less thoughtful initial reactions and sometimescompletely reject them.As our experience in a field deepens, our intuitions regarding that field becomeever more perceptive. I say this with some caveats. From my own introspectionsand those of my acquaintances whom I have queried, I conclude that we are notconsciously aware of the way our mind’s “black box” or frontal lobe works: Wepour information into our mind and, with a delay, out pop epiphanies. AlbertEinstein, an intellectual tower of the twentieth century, when queried about thesource of his insights, described the process: “A new idea comes suddenly and ina rather intuitive way. But intuition is nothing but the outcome of earlierintellectual experience.”16[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber26] Not surprisingly,important innovative intuitions occur only to those whose mental databanks aresufficiently endowed.Most human responses to economic events are in the end rational, or largely so,as much of animal spirits are heavily tempered by rational oversight. Markets,even in their most euphoric or fear-driven state, do not expect global stockmarket averages to double or triple overnight, or wheat prices to fall to fivecents a bushel.Animal spirits nonetheless cannot readily be classified as either rational orirrational. These are terms from the world of free choice, not the world of thehardwired determinism of inbred reactions. But to the extent that any humanaction is at least partially driven by “spirits,” the material outcomes are lesssatisfactory (in purely economic terms) than they would be under thehypothetical presumption that animal spirits did not exist and that humanbeings’ economic behavior was wholly rational. A fundamental insight ofclassical economics is that wealth and standards of living are maximized whenmarket participants seek their own long-term self-interests. Anything short ofthat, by definition, is suboptimal. If the maximum growth in output per hour inthe developed world over fifteen-year periods has been 3 percent (see Chapter 8[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-13.xhtml]) under an economy significantly affectedby animal spirits, then the hypothetical growth rate of output per hour withoutanimal spirits, of necessity, would have been much higher. If the differencewere only one half of a percentage point a year, the cumulative level over, say,a fifty-year span would be more than a fourth higher at the end of that timespan. Clearly the substituting of animal spirits for the hypothetical modelbased on rational long-term self-interest is not likely to be a trivialquantity. Knowing what the human race could do if it were fully rational atleast gives us the upper bounds of possible economic achievement."},{"pageContent":"TWOTHE CRISIS BEGINS, INTENSIFIES, AND ABATESI first became fully aware of the seriousness of the developing global financialcrisis with the disclosure on August 9, 2007, that BNP Paribas, a major Frenchbank, was holding significant quantities of defaulting securitized Americansubprime mortgages. That disclosure was followed later that day by a massiveinjection of reserves by the European Central Bank (ECB). On August 10, the ECBwas joined by the central banks of the United States, Japan, Australia, andCanada in the first globally coordinated action by central banks since 2001. Iwas stunned. Such coordination, in my experience, was implemented only whencentral banks perceived the risk of imminent and serious financial or economicdisruption.For a while the official concerns were largely confined to the financial andhousing sectors. In early 2007, the composition of the world’s nonfinancialcorporate balance sheets and cash flows appeared in as good a shape as I canever recall.1 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber27] After theS&P 500 closed at record highs on July 19, stock prices fell sharply in theweeks following as lackluster data on new home sales; a dismal outlook fromCountrywide Financial, the largest mortgage lender; and a handful ofdisappointing earnings reports compounded growing fears of problems in thehousing and mortgage markets.The markets nonetheless quickly shook off the bad news and stock pricesrecovered all of their losses and more, peaking at an all-time high on October9, 2007. But the cracks were already appearing. As the crisis widened, stockprices turned down and proceeded to decline for the eleven months leading up tothe Lehman failure. By the time of the Lehman default on September 15, 2008,global losses in publicly traded corporate equities stood at $16 trillion. Butlosses more than doubled in the weeks following the Lehman default, bringing thecumulative drop in global equity values to almost $35 trillion, a decline ofmore than half. Added to that were trillions of dollars of losses of equity inhomes ($7 trillion in the United States alone) and losses of nonlisted corporateand unincorporated businesses that brought the global aggregate equity lossclose to $50 trillion, equivalent to a staggering four fifths of 2008 globalGDP.LIQUIDITY EVAPORATIONThe period of deep financial trauma began with the wholly unanticipatedevaporation of the global supply of short-term credit in the immediate wake ofthe Lehman Brothers failure. Such a breakdown on so global a scale was withouthistorical precedent.2 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber28] Arun on money market mutual funds, heretofore perceived to be close to riskless,was under way within hours of the announcement of Lehman’s default,3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber29] followed within days by ageneral withdrawal of trade credit that set off a spiral of global economiccontraction.4 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber30] Meanwhile,the Federal Reserve had to move quickly to support the failing U.S. commercialpaper market. Even the fully collateralized repurchase agreement marketencountered severe and unprecedented difficulties as the quality of debtcollateral was severely undermined by the collapse in the value of thecounterparties’ equity buffer. With a severely diminished global equity buffer,debt burdens became oppressive. Finance was in the grip of the most dreaded ofanimal spirits: a fear-induced stampede.Particularly hard hit were the investment banks that were prone to the type ofrun by their creditors that had often been experienced by commercial banks priorto the onset of deposit insurance in 1933. Not only did short-term fundingcollapse, but, as I note in Chapter 5 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-10.xhtml],customer collateral that was subject to recall fled. The institutions were ledastray by the mistaken belief that the tight bid-ask spreads in financialmarkets at the top of the boom were an indication of a persistent availabilityof liquidity. That in fact was not the case. As I point out later, liquidity isa function of the state of risk aversion, and when risk aversion rises sharply,liquidity evaporates.While commercial banks had their share of failures,5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber31] many of the most complexdangers emanated from the so-called shadow banking system—the set of financialinstitutions that do not accept insured deposits and hence heretofore had beenlargely unregulated. But not all shadow banking was devastated. Unaffiliatedhedge funds, by and large, weathered the storm.*[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-6_fn1.xhtml#footnote-1443-2] To my knowledge, noneof the larger funds failed. To be sure, many of them had to liquidate aftersevere losses, but none defaulted on their debt.SHADOW BANKINGShadow banking is a form of financial intermediation whose funding is notsupported by the traditional banking safety nets—in the United States, depositinsurance and access to central bank funding. Shadow banking includes theactivities of investment banks, hedge funds, money market funds, structuredinvestment vehicles (SIVs), and other credit intermediaries acting outside theregular banking system. Those institutions have developed in recent decades intoa very substantial part of international finance and have been heavy traders inderivatives, including synthetic collateralized debt obligations and creditdefault swaps. Although shadow banking activities lie outside the bankingsystem, many of these activities have been conducted by regulated banks. Forexample, most SIVs were organized by commercial banks. The expansion of SIVs andother off-balance-sheet conduits moved significant amounts of assets andliabilities off bank balance sheets, thereby ostensibly creating more robustcapital levels. But as the crisis loomed, SIVs that carried the name andreputation of their originating banking entities were absorbed (with their risk)back onto the banks’ balance sheets.The shadow banking system globally grew at an astonishing pace in the yearsleading up to the crisis, and appears to have changed little since. According toa November 2012 report by the Financial Stability Board,6[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber32] assets of shadow bankinginstitutions globally grew from $26 trillion in 2002 to $62 trillion in 2007,and following a decline in 2008, reached $67 trillion by the end of 2011. As ashare of total financial intermediary assets, shadow banking consistentlyaccounted for 23 percent to 27 percent during that time frame. Of course, theassets of commercial banks grew at a nearly proportional rapid pace, and thusthe shadow banking system remained slightly more than half the size of theregular banking system throughout the 2002 to 2011 period. Still, they were verylarge players on the financial landscape. In the United States alone, shadowbanking constituted $23 trillion in assets at the end of 2011, by far thelargest constituent of the global network of nonbank credit intermediaries.BANK CAPITAL BUFFERSBanking has always involved inducing depositors, or in earlier centuries noteholders, to fund bank assets. In the 1840s, for example, U.S. (state) banks hadto maintain a capital buffer in excess of 50 percent of assets in order tocreate willing holders of their notes (Exhibit 2.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_2_1]). In the century thatfollowed, the necessary capital buffer declined with the increasingconsolidation of specie reserves following the Civil War. That consolidationoccurred as improved rail transportation facilitated the movement of specie, andtelegraphed money transfers grew as correspondent bank links expanded. Finally,in later years, the emergence of various government safety nets reduced the needfor capital.Systemic risk in the United States is almost exclusively generated by the risksposed by financial institutions and financial markets—the concern especiallybeing that defaults of those institutions could dismantle the financial systemand, with it, the broader economy. The systemic risks posed by nonfinancialcompanies are far less daunting. The default of an individual nonfinancialcorporation will affect its creditors, suppliers, and some of its customers, butrarely does it have an effect much beyond that. Nonfinancial corporate defaultsdo not have the broad contagious effect that is associated with the default of afinancial institution. Moreover, nonfinancial businesses hold a much higherratio of equity to assets than do financial institutions, typically one third toone half of the value of assets, compared with only 5 percent to 15 percent forhighly liquid financial firms.TOO BIG TO FAILThe perceived systemic effect of the failure of large financial institutions isthe genesis of the “too big to fail” (TBTF) or the “too big to liquidatequickly” problem. For years I have been concerned about the ever larger size ofour financial institutions. More than a decade ago, I noted that “megabanksbeing formed by growth and consolidation are increasingly complex entities thatcreate the potential for unusually large systemic risks in the national andinternational economy should they fail.”7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber33] Federal Reserve researchhad been unable to find economies of scale in banking beyond a modest-sizedinstitution.8 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber34] I oftenwondered as the banks increased in size throughout the globe prior to the crashand since: Had bankers discovered economies of scale that Fed research hadmissed?One highly disturbing consequence of the TBTF-bailout problem is that it isgoing to be difficult to convince market participants henceforth that a largefinancial institution in trouble should be allowed to fail. The implicit subsidyto these large institutions that such notions spawn insidiously impairs theefficiency of finance and the allocation of capital. I will address thisimportant issue in Chapters 5 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-10.xhtml] and 11[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-16.xhtml].In retrospect it is now evident to all that the level of capital that commercialbanks and especially investment banks accumulated prior to 2008 as crisisprotection was inadequate. The marked increase in risk taking of a decade agocould have been guarded against wholly by increased capital. Regrettably, thatdid not occur and the accompanying dangers were not fully appreciated, even inthe commercial banking sector. For example, in 2006, the Federal DepositInsurance Corporation (FDIC), speaking for all U.S. bank regulators, judged that“more than 99 percent of all insured institutions met or exceeded therequirements of the highest regulatory capital standards.”9[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber35] Newly acquired capitaladditions accordingly remained modest.RISK MANAGEMENT FAILSBut why did the large array of fail-safe buffers that were supposed to countersuch developing crises fail? We had thought that we depend on our highlysophisticated global system of financial risk management to contain marketbreakdowns. How could these systems have failed on so broad a scale? The riskmanagement paradigm that had as its genesis the work of several Nobel Prizewinners in economics—Harry Markowitz, Robert Merton, and Myron Scholes (andFischer Black, who would have received the award had he lived)—was so thoroughlyembraced by academia, central banks, and regulators that by 2006 it had becomethe core of the global bank regulatory standards known as Basel II. Global bankswere authorized, within limits, to apply their own company-specific risk-basedmodels to judge their capital requirements. Most models estimated theirparameters based on the last quarter century of observations. But even asophisticated number-crunching model that covered the last five decades wouldnot have anticipated the crisis that loomed.Mathematical models that calibrate risk are surely better guides to riskassessment than the “rule of thumb” judgments of a half century earlier. To thisday it is hard to find fault with the conceptual framework of our models, as faras they go. The elegant options-pricing model of Black and Scholes is no lessvalid or useful today than when it was developed in 1973. In the growing stateof euphoria in the years before the 2008 crash, private risk managers, theFederal Reserve, and other regulators failed to ensure that financialinstitutions were adequately capitalized, in part because we all failed tocomprehend the underlying magnitude and the full extent of the risks that wereabout to be revealed as the post–Lehman crisis played out. In particular, wefailed to fully comprehend the size of the expansion of so-called tail risk.Tail risk is financial jargon that risk managers employ to identify the class ofinvestment outcomes that occur with very low probabilities—but that areaccompanied by very large losses when they materialize (see Box 2.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-7.xhtml#box_2_1]). For decades, a number of unusual“once in a lifetime” phenomena were occurring much too often to be crediblydescribed as owing purely to chance. A defining moment for me was the whollyunprecedented stock price crash on October 19, 1987, that propelled the DowJones Industrial Average down more than 20 percent in that single day. There wasno simple probability distribution from which that event could be inferred.Accordingly, the negative “tail” was thought to be fat. But when thosepreviously unvisited areas of investment outcome distributions were filled insubsequent to the Lehman default, the fat tails turned out, in fact, to bemorbidly obese. As a consequence of an underestimation of these risks, riskmanagers failed to anticipate the amount of additional capital that would berequired to serve as an adequate buffer when the financial system was jolted.BOX 2.1: TAIL RISKIf people acted solely to maximize their own self-interest, their actions wouldproduce a long-term growth path consistent with their ability to increaseproductivity. But lacking omniscience, the actual outcomes of their risk takingwould reflect random deviations from their long-term trend. And thosedeviations, with enough observations, would tend to be distributed in a mannersimilar to successive coin tosses, following what economists call a “normal”distribution (a bell curve with tails that rapidly taper off as the probabilityof occurrence diminishes).If we introduce the realism of behavioral economics and add our propensities ofeuphoria and fear, we produce the business cycle that shifts observations ofrisk-taking outcomes from the middle parts of the distribution toward its tails.But as I demonstrate in Chapter 4 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-9.xhtml], fear isa far more potent propensity than euphoria. The adjusted real-world probabilitydistribution that emerges exhibits a tail of positive outcomes that is barelydiscernible, but a negative tail that is both highly visible and large.The 2008 financial collapse has provided reams of new data to identify the shapeof the critical, heretofore unknown tails of investors’ “loss functions”; thechallenge will be to use the new data to develop a more realistic assessment ofthe range and probabilities of financial outcomes, with an emphasis on thosethat pose the greatest dangers to the financial system and the economy. One canhope that in a future deep financial crisis—and there will surely be one—we willbe more informed as to the way fat-tail markets work.CREDIT-RATING AGENCIES FAILAnother important source of the failure of risk management was the almostindecipherable complexity of the broad spectrum of new financial products andmarkets that developed as number-crunching and communication capabilitiessoared.10 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber36] Investmentmanagers subcontracted an inordinately large part of their task to the “safeharbor” risk designations of the credit-rating agencies, especially Moody’s,Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch. Most investment officers believed no furtherjudgment was required of them because they were effectively held harmless by thejudgments of these government-sanctioned rating organizations. Especiallyproblematic were the triple-A ratings bestowed by the credit-rating agencies onmany securities that in fact proved highly toxic. Despite decades of experience,the analysts at the credit-rating agencies proved no more adept at anticipatingthe onset of crisis than the investment community at large, and their favorableratings of many securities offered a false sense of security to a great manyinvestors.REGULATION FAILSEven with the breakdown of our sophisticated risk management models and thefailures of the credit-rating agencies, the financial system would likely haveheld together had the third bulwark against crisis—our regulatorysystem—functioned effectively. But it, too, failed for many of the same reasonsthat risk management and the credit-rating agencies failed: an underappreciationof the risks faced by the financial system and an increasing complexity thatmade effective oversight especially difficult. Along with the vast majority ofmarket participants, regulators did not anticipate the onset of crisis. Not onlydid regulators in the United States fail, but abroad, the heavily praised U.K.Financial Services Authority was unable to anticipate and prevent the bank runthat threatened one of that country’s largest commercial banks, Northern Rock,the first such run in Britain in a century. Moreover, the Basel Committee onBanking Supervision, representing regulatory authorities from the world’s majorfinancial systems, promulgated a set of capital rules (Basel II) that did notforesee the rapidly rising capital needs of the institutions under theirpurview.It was not a lack of regulatory depth that was at fault. U.S. commercial andsavings banks are extensively regulated; despite the fact that for years our tento fifteen largest banking institutions have had permanently assigned on-siteexaminers to oversee daily operations, many of these banks still were able totake on toxic assets that brought them to their knees. Bank regulators hadalways relied on the thought that “prompt corrective action” would be a keyweapon to be wielded against default; weak institutions would be shut down wellbefore they ran out of capital, thereby preventing losses to the FDIC’s reservesand ultimately to taxpayers. In the event, and contrary to every expectation ofregulatory practice, the FDIC has had to charge off well upward of a halftrillion dollars since the Lehman default.THE SHORTFALL OF CAPITALOne of my very first experiences as Federal Reserve chairman was at a staffmeeting where I naively asked, “How do you determine the appropriate level ofcapital?” I was surprised at the lack of response. I soon realized that suchfundamental issues are taken as a given and rarely addressed other than in theaftermath of a crisis. And through all of the years of my tenure at the Fed,bank capital had always seemed adequate to regulators. (See, for example, the2006 FDIC statement quoted earlier in this chapter.) I have since regretted thatwe regulators never pursued the issue of capital adequacy in a timely manner.No regulatory structures anywhere in the developed world required all of themajor global financial institutions to maintain adequate capital buffers. Andthere can be little doubt that had capital levels of banks and other financialintermediaries worldwide been high enough to absorb all of the losses thatsurfaced after the Lehman default, no contagious defaults could have occurredand the crisis of 2008 would have been contained. In the normal course ofbanking, unexpected adverse economic events diminish a bank’s capital, but inalmost all cases, the buffer (provision for loan losses plus capital) remainsadequate to fend off default. And with time, the flow of undistributed earningsand newly raised equity replenishes the depleted bank capital.However, as 2008 starkly demonstrated, not all such events end so benignly. Onrare occasions enough capital is breached, or wiped out, setting off anavalanche of serial defaults in which the suspension of payments by one firmthrows its often highly leveraged financial counterparties into default. Thosecascading defaults lead cumulatively to a full-blown crisis. Default contagionhas many of the same characteristics of a snow avalanche, where a small breachin snow cover progressively builds until the surface tension breaks and a wholehillside of snow collapses.For the same reasons that it is difficult to determine when a small crack in thesnow cover will trigger a full-blown avalanche, it has proved difficult to judgein advance what will trigger a full-blown financial crisis, especially on thescale of September 2008.DEBT MATTERSStill, the question remains: Why did the bursting of the housing bubble set offan avalanche of financial failure when the deflation of the dot-com bubble in2000 left so mild an imprint on the financial system and on the macroeconomy? Tobe sure, a recession followed the stock market bust, but the recession was oneof the mildest on record and was relatively short-lived. Real GDP and employmentin that downturn exhibited scarcely anything close to the savage contractionthat followed the bursting of the housing bubble six years later. Reaching evenfurther back, despite the (still) record one-day destruction of stock marketwealth on October 19, 1987, there was virtually no mark left on overall economicactivity.Because the U.S. economy had so readily weathered the dot-com and 1987 bubbles,I had hopes at the outset of the 2008 crisis that the reaction to the housingbubble collapse would be similar. I did raise an early caution flag before aFederal (Reserve) Open Market Committee meeting in 2002 when I asserted that“our extraordinary housing boom . . . financed by very large increases inmortgage debt, cannot continue indefinitely.” It did—for four more years. And Ithought its effect could be contained. It wasn’t.11[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber37]The critical reason for the much more severe outcome in the wake of the burstingof the housing bubble is that debt matters. In retrospect, and as I discuss indetail in Chapter 3 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-8.xhtml], there can be littledoubt that escalating defaults of securitized subprime mortgages were thetrigger of the recent financial crisis. However, even after financial subprimeproblems arose in August 2007, there was little awareness of what was on thehorizon.12 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber38] When defaultsof the underlying collateral for mortgage pools (primarily of privately issuedsubprime and Alt-A mortgage-backed securities) became widespread in 2007, thecapital buffers of many banks (commercial and shadow) were dangerouslyimpaired.13 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber39] And as thedemand in the United States for homeownership collapsed and home prices fell,widespread defaults of mortgage-backed securities saddled banks and other highlyleveraged financial institutions with heavy losses, both in the United Statesand Europe.In contrast, on the eve of the dot-com stock market crash of 2000, highlyleveraged institutions held a relatively small share of equities, and anespecially small share of technology stocks, the toxic asset of that bubble.Most stock was held by households (who were considerably less leveraged at thattime than they became as the decade progressed) and pension funds. Their losses,while severe, were readily absorbed without contagious bankruptcies because theamount of debt held to fund equity investment was small. Accordingly, fewlenders went into default and an avalanche was avoided. A similar scenarioplayed out following the crash of 1987.One can imagine how the crisis would have played out if the stocks that fellsharply in 2000 (or 1987) had been held by leveraged institutions in theproportions that mortgages and mortgage securities were held in 2008. The U.S.economy almost certainly would have experienced a far more destabilizingscenario than in fact occurred.Alternatively, if mortgage-backed securities in 2008 had been held inunleveraged institutions—defined contribution pension funds (401ks) and mutualfunds, for example—as had been the case for stocks in 2000, those institutionswould still have suffered large losses, but bankruptcies, triggered by debtdefaults, would have been far fewer.Whether the toxic assets precipitating the bubble collapses of 1987, 2000, and2008 were equities or mortgage-backed securities probably mattered little. Itwas the capital impairment on the balance sheets of financial institutions thatprovoked the crisis. Debt securities were the problem in 2008, but the sameeffect would have been experienced by the financial system had the dollar amountof losses incurred by highly leveraged financial institutions in the wake of thecollapsing housing bubble been in equity investments rather than mortgage-backedsecurities.Had Bear Stearns, the smallest of the investment banks, been allowed to fail, itmight merely have advanced the crisis by six months. Alternatively, had themarket absorbed the Bear failure without contagion, Lehman Brothers might havebeen put on notice, with ample time, to aggressively lower its high-riskprofile. We will never know. But I assume that, seeing a successful Bear Stearnsrescue, Lehman concluded that all investment banks larger than Bear would havebeen judged “too big to fail,” offering the prospect of a similar rescue toLehman had it been necessary. That scenario conceivably dulled Lehman’sincentive to take (costly) precautionary actions to augment its capital.IDENTIFYING TOXIC ASSETSA related obstacle for forecasting and policy setting is that we seek toidentify in advance which assets or markets could turn toxic and precipitate acrisis. It was not apparent in the early 2000s, as many commentatorsretroactively assume, that subprime securities were headed toward being thetoxic asset that in 2007 they turned out to be. AAA-rated collateralized debtobligations based on subprime mortgages issued in 2005, for example, were bideffectively at par through mid-2007. They were still bid at over 90 percent ofpar just prior to the crisis. By March 2009, six months after the crisiserupted, they had fallen to 60 percent of par.14[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber40]Bankers, like all asset managers, try to avoid a heavy concentration of relatedassets in highly leveraged portfolios in order to avoid the risk that they willall turn sour simultaneously. Nonetheless, such a concentration ofassets—securitized mortgages—did end up on the balance sheets of innumerablebanks, both in the United States and abroad. At the time, presumablyknowledgeable bankers judged the assets, at acquisition, sufficiently sound toleverage them. For most it was only in retrospect that they were able todifferentiate good assets from bad. Securitization conveyed a false sense offinancial well-being. Large bundles of seemingly diversified mortgages appeareda lot less risky than stand-alone mortgages. The problem was that if all thosemortgages were vulnerable to the same macroshock (a decline in house prices),there was in the end more risk and less diversification than mortgage investorsrealized.Regulators, in my experience, are no better qualified to make such judgmentsthan the initiators of the investments. This is the reason I have long arguedthat regulators should let banks buy (within limits) whatever they choose, butimpose large generic equity capital requirements as reserve against losses thatwill happen, but which cannot be identified in advance.15[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber41] As I demonstrate inChapter 5 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-10.xhtml], regulations whose effectivenessrelies heavily on regulators’ forecasts of the future credit quality of theportfolios they regulate have almost always proved ineffective.BEWARE OF POLICY SUCCESSAll speculative bubbles have a roughly similar trajectory and time frame overwhich the expansion leg of a bubble takes place.16[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber42] Bubbles often emerge fromgrowing expectations of stable long-term productivity and output growth combinedwith stable prices.The near quarter century from 1983 to 2007 was a period of very shallowrecessions and seemingly extraordinary stability. But protracted economicstability is precisely the tinder that ignites bubbles. All that is necessary isthat a modest proportion of market participants view the change as structural. Aquarter century of stability is rationally intoxicating. Herd behavior thentakes over to enhance the uptrend.Central banks have increasingly been confronted by the prospect that theirsuccess in achieving stable prices has laid the groundwork for asset pricebubbles. This issue has concerned me for years. I expressed my discomfort in aFederal Open Market Committee meeting in May 1995. “The disequilibrium that isimplicit in this [current] forecast is an asset price bubble . . . I am not sureat this stage that we know how, or by what means, we ought to be responding tothat, and whether we dare . . . I almost hope that the economy will be a littleless tranquil, buoyant, and pleasant because the end result of that [has] not[been] terribly helpful.”17[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber43]How to deal with this prospect remains a challenge without a simple solution, atleast to date. As copycat herd behavior converts “skeptical” investors to“believers,” stock prices, capital investment, and the economy are thought tohave nowhere to go but up. With different assets and actors, the numerousbubbles of the last century have followed similar paths.HISTORY REPEATSNonetheless, given the repetitiveness of history, I could never get beyond thegeneral notion that as the years of only modestly interrupted economic expansionrolled on, we would eventually be assaulted by disabling financial crises. As Iput it in 2000, “we do not, and probably cannot, know the precise nature of thenext international financial crisis. That there will be one is as certain as thepersistence of human financial indiscretion.”18[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber44] The evidence wascompelling that these episodes, though only occurring once or twice in acentury, were nonetheless too recurrent and eerily similar in nature to bewholly sui generis.In the chapters ahead, I will delve more deeply into the causes of the currentcrisis and its aftermath, and evaluate the tools that we economists have createdto peer into the future, parsing the major policy disagreements that haveplagued the economics profession in recent years. Every policy initiativereflects both a forecast of the future and a paradigm of the way an economyworks. The current debates are part of an ongoing evolution of economicforecasting.REGRESSION PRIMERREGRESSION ANALYSISAstronomers have the capacity to forecast when the sun will rise outside mybedroom window exactly six months from now. Economists have no suchcapabilities. We seek instead to infer what history tells us about our future bydisaggregating the “causes” of our economic past and assuming they will prevailin the future. In short, we endeavor to learn what caused, for example, capitalinvestments to behave as they did in the past, and where they will settle ifthose forces are replicated in our future. To assist in that daunting task,economists rely heavily on the discipline of regression19[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber45] analysis—statisticaltechniques whose roots lie in probability analysis, a discipline well known toall who play games of chance.The raw material of business forecasting is the extensive body of time seriesthat trace, for example, retail sales, industrial production, and housingstarts. We seek to understand the economic factors determining monthlysingle-family housing starts, for example, and hope to forecast them. As aresult of conversations with home builders, I might initially choose home pricesand household formation as plausible explanatory variables. We call the timeseries being analyzed the dependent variable, and those explaining it—homeprices and household formation—the independent variables. Regression analysis,then, statistically seeks out how a change in each independent variable impactshousing starts. The cleverness of such a filtering process is that it infers therelative statistical weights—coefficients—that, when applied to both home pricesand household formation, yield a “fitted” time series that most closelyapproximates the history of actual housing starts.With these data we can measure the fraction of the fluctuations (variance) ofthe dependent variable that is “explained” by the fluctuations of theindependent variables in the model. That fraction is what we call the multipleregression coefficient (R2). The higher the R2, the closer the fitted timeseries is to the actual historical series. At 1.0, it exactly predicts theactual data series and explains all of the variance in the dependent variable.But the reliability of the results rests on a number of mathematical conditionsrequired of the regression variables. For example, the independent variableshave to be completely uncorrelated with one another—that is, home price must notbe correlated with household formation. In addition, the residuals of theregression, the difference between actual housing starts and their fitted(calculated) value in each period, cannot be “serially correlated”—that is, theresidual in one period cannot influence the residual in the next.In the real world, these conditions are almost never met. So statisticians havedevised ways to measure and partially correct the extent to which theassumptions fall short. For instance, the Durbin-Watson statistic (D-W) measuresthe extent to which the sequential residuals are serially correlated. The D-Wranges between 0 and 4.0. A D-W of 2.0 indicates that the residuals areuncorrelated while a D-W of less than 2.0 indicates positive serial correlation,a bias that creates an overestimation of the statistical significance of theindependent variables (see discussion of the t-statistic and statisticalsignificance below).20 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber46]Serial correlation is a characteristic of virtually all economic time seriesbecause the previous quarter’s residual, in reality, does economically impactthat of the current quarter. Converting the level of a time series to itsabsolute change will decrease serial correlation in a regression, but such atransformation will eliminate important information contained in the level formof the data. In my analyses, I prefer to live with serial correlation.The t-statistic is a measure of the “statistical significance” of an independentvariable—that is, the probability that its coefficient is different from zero.21[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber47] The higher thet-statistic, the higher the probability that the relationship between anindependent variable and the dependent variable is real, not merely the productof chance. Economists usually require a t-statistic, whether positive ornegative, to be higher than 2.0 before we accord an independent variablecredibility as a “cause” of variations of the dependent variable. The Newey-Westestimator measures the extent of bias in the t-statistic owing to serialcorrelation and resets the t-values so that they more truly reflect the actualprobabilities.Another prominent bias in many economic correlations results from two timeseries that are only slightly related, if at all, but nonetheless exhibit a highR2 when regressed against each other because both series reflect populationgrowth. This bias can be largely eliminated by expressing the dependent andindependent variables on a per capita basis.Exhibit 7.3 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-7.xhtml#exhibit_7_3] is a typicalexample of regression analysis. The dependent variable is capital investment asa share of cash flow for nonfinancial corporations. We collect quarterlyobservations not only for the dependent variable, but also for the threeindependent variables22 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber48]from 1970 to date. The dependent variable is regressed against the threeindependent variables and we create a fitted estimate of capital investment’sshare of cash flow. With an R2 of .76, we have in effect “explained” threefourths of the variation in the share. As can be seen from the associated chart,the fitted series closely follows the actual share. The Newey-West–adjustedt-values are well in excess of 2.0 and hence the probability that therelationships are wholly the result of chance can be dismissed. TheDurbin-Watson measure of serial correlation is only 0.57, suggesting there isstill significant serial correlation. But as can be seen from the chart, it hasnot prevented the independent variables from following the dependent variablethrough boom and bust. Moreover, if we split the forty-three-year regressionperiod into two equal halves, the results of the regressions for the two smallerperiods are similar to those of the full regression. This is a useful test ofwhether the independent variables’ impact on the dependent variable has changedover the forty-three years. The results here suggest not.10232.jpg [../Images/10232.jpg]A POINT OF CAUTIONWe must be careful to distinguish correlation (which regression analysis canmeasure) and causation (which it cannot). A high R2 and high t-statistics arenot necessarily, in themselves, a credible measure of causation. Regressionanalysis has turned out to be one of the most effective tools for diviningeconomic cause and effect. But we must always keep in mind that correlation orassociation is not the same as causation. It must be backed up with a credibleeconomic explanation of the association.Regression equations as well as economic identities (see Box 9.3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-14.xhtml#box_9_3]) are the most prominent inputs ofour macroeconomic models. Regression analysis became widespread only withadvances in computational capability. Back in the 1950s, it took me hours, ifnot days to estimate a regression using the desk calculators of the time. Withtoday’s computers and software, I need press only a small number of keys toproduce an almost instantaneous final result."},{"pageContent":"THREETHE ROOTS OF CRISISThe toxic securitized U.S. subprime mortgages were the immediate trigger of thefinancial crisis, but the origins of the crisis reach back to the aftermath ofthe Cold War.1 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber49] The fall ofthe Berlin Wall in 1989 exposed the economic ruin produced by the Soviet bloc’seconomic system. East Germany, touted as a strong competitor to West Germany,turned out to have achieved little more than one third the productivity levelsof West Germany after four decades of rivalry.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated that by 2005more than eight hundred million members of the world’s labor force were engagedin export-oriented competitive market activities, an increase of five hundredmillion since the fall of the Berlin Wall.4[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber52] Additional hundreds ofmillions engaged in domestic-oriented competitive markets, especially in theformer Soviet Union.Because consumption in the developing world was restrained, perhaps by culture,inadequate access to consumer finance, or in response to the aftermath of theAsian financial crisis, it did not keep up with the surge of income. As aconsequence, the savings rate of the developing world soared from 23 percent ofnominal GDP in 1999 to 33 percent by 2007, far outstripping its rate ofinvestment. With investment elsewhere in the world slow to take up the slack,the result was a pronounced fall from 2000 to 2005 in global long-term interestrates, both nominal (Exhibit 3.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_3_1]) and real.5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber53] Of course, whether it wasa glut of intended saving or a shortfall of investment intentions is of interestprimarily to economists. The conclusion is the same either way: Real long-terminterest rates had to fall, and they did.Long-term interest rates in all developed economies and the major developingeconomies had by 2006 converged to single digits.6[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber54] Equity premiums (theexcess rate of return required by investors in risky stocks over the returnavailable on sovereign debt) and real estate capitalization rates wereinevitably pressured lower by the fall in global long-term real interest rates.Asset prices, particularly home prices, accordingly moved dramatically higher.The Economist’s surveys of nearly twenty individual countries document thestriking global nature of the rapid ascent of home prices during the decade.7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber55] Japan, Germany, andSwitzerland (for differing reasons) were the only important exceptions. At theirpeak increases, U.S. home price gains were no more rapid than the globalaverage.8 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber56]In short, geopolitical events ultimately led to a fall in long-term interestrates and the mortgage interest rates to which they were tied. That led, with alag, to a global boom in home prices. In the United States the change in thethirty-year mortgage interest rate tends to lead the monthly change in homeprices (in the opposite direction) by three months (Exhibit 3.3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_3_3]).9[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber57]The subprime mortgage market that developed in the 1990s was a small butgenerally successful market of largely fixed-rate mortgages. It served mainlythose potential homeowners who could not meet the down payment requirement of aprime loan but still had income adequate to handle the monthly payments of afixed-rate mortgage. But when home prices accelerated after 1996 (Exhibit 3.4[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_3_4]), subprime lending becameincreasingly attractive to investors. That said, subprime mortgages stillconstituted only 7 percent of total originations by 2002, and only a modestamount of those had been securitized.SECURITIZATION OF SUBPRIMES: THE CRISIS STORY UNFOLDSBelatedly drawn to the growing market for subprimes, many major financial firms,starting in late 2003, began to accelerate the pooling and packaging of subprimemortgages into securities (Exhibit 3.5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_3_5]). Leading the pack ofsecuritizers were Countrywide Financial and Lehman Brothers—firms that wereultimately brought down by their involvement with these instruments. Combined,they issued more than a fifth of securitized subprimes in 2004.10[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber58] The firms clearly hadfound receptive buyers. Heavy demand from Europe,11[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber59] in the form of subprimemortgage-backed collateralized debt obligations, was fostered by attractiveyields and a foreclosure rate on the underlying mortgages that, since late 2000,had been in decline for almost three years. The securitizers pressed subprimemortgage lenders such as Ameriquest, New Century, and Countrywide to originatemortgages and sell them to securitizers. This reversed the conventional sequenceof mortgage banks, assisted by brokers, originating mortgages and then decidingto sell them to securitizers.But a far heavier demand was driven by the need of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,the major U.S. government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), to meet the expanded“affordable housing goal” requirements of the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment.12 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber60]Given the GSEs’ expanded commitments, they had few alternatives but to invest,wholesale, in subprime securities.13[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber61] As a consequence, by 2004,the GSEs accounted for nearly half of all newly purchased subprime mortgagesecurities retained on investors’ balance sheets (Exhibit 3.6[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_3_6]).14[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber62] That was more than fivetimes their estimated share in 2002. To meet this demand, securitizers began topurchase and securitize much of the billions of dollars of subprime wholemortgages not already pooled to back outstanding mortgage securities. But thatsource was nowhere near enough to meet the GSEs’ needs, and at this point,securitizers unwisely prodded subprime mortgage originators to increase theirscale of originations. But the number of potential homeowners seeking subprimefixed-rate mortgages was small. The originators therefore chose to reach out toa wholly new segment of potential homeowners who could meet neither the downpayments of a prime loan nor the monthly debt-servicing requirements offixed-rate subprime mortgages. The only available option to entice new, butrisky, buyers was to offer adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to subprimeborrowers with initially lower monthly payments. As a result, the share of ARMsin the total value of first mortgages subprime originations soared to nearly 62percent by the second quarter of 2007.15[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber63] The mortgage arrears ofsubprime ARMs almost immediately began to rise, and many borrowers failed tomake even the first mortgage payment. Delinquencies of more than ninety daysbegan to mount.16 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber64]By the first quarter of 2007, owing to pressure on the securitizers to meet thedemand for subprime securities from the GSEs, virtually all subprime mortgageoriginations (predominantly ARMs) were being securitized, compared with lessthan half in 2000.17 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber65] Alsoby the end of March 2007, more than $800 billion, or more than 80 percent oftotal outstanding subprime mortgages, was in pools supporting outstandingsubprime mortgage securities.18[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber66] That $800 billion figurewas almost seven times its level at the end of 2001.Subsequent to 2003, the securitizers, profitably packaging this new source ofadjustable-rate mortgage paper into mortgage pools and armed with what turnedout to be grossly inflated credit ratings, were able to sell seemingly unlimitedamounts of these securities into what appeared to be a vast and receptive globalmarket. But this proved to be a mirage.By 2005 and 2006, subprime mortgage originations had swelled to 20 percent ofall U.S. home mortgage originations, almost triple their share in 2002.19[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber67] We at the Federal Reservewere aware earlier in the decade of incidents of some highly irregular subprimemortgage underwriting practices. But, regrettably, we viewed it as a localizedproblem subject to standard prudential oversight, not the precursor of thesecuritized subprime mortgage bubble that was to arise several years later. Onfirst being told in the early months of 2005 by Fed staff of the quarterly datafor 2004, I expressed surprise given that our most recent official Feddata—those of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) compilations for2003—exhibited few signs of problems. I had never heard of the private sourceInside Mortgage Finance before. But in retrospect those data turned out to beright.But even had we had the hard official data from 2005 at that time (it waseventually published in the 2006 HMDA report by the Federal Reserve in December2006), there was little the Fed could have done to contain the rise in homeprices.Some academics favored an incremental defusing of the bubble through a gradualtightening of monetary policy, but such incremental policies have never appearedto have worked in the real world. The Federal Reserve’s incremental tighteningin 1994 in the face of the inchoate dot-com boom, in retrospect, may well havefostered the bubble rather than contained it.20[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber68] Policy makers confrontnonmarket problems all the time, a large majority of which are readily resolved.We can spot bubbles as they inflate, but we are not able to forecast theircomplex resolution and collapse and, as I note later, perhaps never will. Inresponding to such issues, policy makers have to choose whether to clamp down onand prohibit a wide variety of market practices and accordingly accept theinevitable constraints on economic growth that that often implies.SIZE OF THE PROBLEM CLOAKEDThe true size of the American subprime problem was hidden for years by thedefective bookkeeping of the GSEs. Fannie Mae was unable to get its bookscertified and had to stop reporting publicly between November 2004 and December2006, pending an often delayed clarification of their accounts. Freddie Mac hadhad similar problems earlier. Not until the summer of 2007 did the fullmagnitude of the subprime problem begin to become apparent. Fannie’sthird-quarter write-offs almost quadrupled relative to the second quarter.Moreover, the source of loss did not become fully evident until September 2009,when Fannie Mae very belatedly disclosed a significant reclassification ofloans, from prime to subprime, dating back to loans that it had made and held in2003 and 2004. More important, those revelations helped to explain how what wasthought to be a relatively sound portfolio of prime conventional mortgages inmid-2007 could generate the huge losses Fannie and Freddie had been reporting.21[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber69] It is doubtful, however,even had such data been available in a timely manner, that regulators would havebeen able to head off the crisis, especially given our experiences with monetarytightening during the dot-com boom.The role of Fannie and Freddie in the American financial system has been highlycontroversial at least since 2003, when the Federal Reserve raised seriousquestions about the potential systemic risk that these institutions might posedown the road. As I put it in testimony before a Senate committee in early 2004,“we see nothing on the immediate horizon that is likely to create a systemicproblem. But to fend off possible future systemic difficulties, which we assessas likely if GSE expansion continues unabated, preventive actions are requiredsooner rather than later.”22[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber70] Our problems with the GSEshad been simmering for years.I recollect getting a call in late October 2008 from Henry Waxman, a seniorHouse Democrat, inquiring whether I agreed with the position that the housingbubble’s primary cause was the heavy demand by the GSEs for subprime mortgagesand securities, as some House members had argued. (The housing market had peakedand fallen in 2006.) I responded that I thought the GSEs did contribute to thecrisis, but that their holdings of subprime securities did not seem sufficientlylarge to account for the size of the bubble. With the new disclosures, it wasobvious that Fannie and Freddie played a far more important role—perhaps even akey role—in the momentum that developed behind the housing bubble than many hadtheretofore recognized.Had Fannie and Freddie not existed, a housing bubble could still have takenhold. But had such a bubble developed, it is likely that in and of itself, itwould not have wreaked such devastation in late 2008. The paths of Canada andAustralia’s house price gains, for example, were in fact quite similar to thoseof the United States. Yet in retrospect, those gains did not have thedestabilizing bubble characteristics experienced by Americans. Their financialsystems were not breached and neither experienced a severe financial crisis.Analysis of such crises is subject to considerable uncertainties, and I havelittle doubt that longtime political supporters of Fannie and Freddie willcontinue to advance potential explanations other than that which I have justoffered. Many still claim the buildup of mortgage assets during 2003 and 2004was simply a business decision on the part of the GSEs to regain lost marketshare (they are, after all, private corporations) and had little to do with theissue of affordable housing. But as Fannie Mae in December 2006, inpolitical-speak, acknowledged, “We have also relaxed some of our underwritingcriteria to obtain goals-qualifying mortgage loans and increased our investmentsin higher-risk mortgage loan products that are more likely to serve theborrowers targeted by HUD’s goals and subgoals, which could increase our creditlosses.”23 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber71] They sure did.A CLASSIC EUPHORIC BUBBLE TAKES HOLDThe housing surge of the last decade had all the hallmarks of a classic euphoricbubble. Financial bubbles occur from time to time, and usually with little or noforewarning. The sources of bubbles and the markets in which they occur arequite varied, but patterns these bubbles trace have very common features. As thetop of a speculative boom in stocks, homes, or commodities is approached, thereobviously still must be a preponderance of buyers over sellers bidding up thosealready high prices. For were it otherwise, those prices could never havereached so high a tipping point. In fact, only if a vast majority of investorsexpect prices to move higher, and are fully committed, can prices break sharply.At that point, as buyers finally become sated, bids disappear, only sellers areleft, and prices plunge.JESSEL’S PARADOXI was first exposed to this bull market paradox as a young teenager when GeorgeJessel, a well-known comedian of the time, told the story of a skepticalinvestor who decides reluctantly to invest in stocks. He started by buying onehundred shares of a rarely traded fly-by-night company. And surprise, the pricesmoved from $10 per share to $11 per share. Encouraged that he had become a wiseinvestor, he bought more. Finally, when he had bid the price up to $30 pershare, he decided to cash in. He called his broker to sell out his position. Thebroker hesitated and then responded: “To whom?” I call it Jessel’s paradox.In an extension of Jessel’s paradox, each “skeptical” buyer gradually becomes acommitted bull. The cumulative process of conversion of bears to bulls propelsprices ever higher, driven in part by herd behavior. In the simple case, at themarket top everyone has turned into a believer and is fully committed. There areno unconverted skeptics left to buy from the first new seller.I am not sure whether my subsequent insights years later added much to theJessel story. But as a measure of how far the appetite for “Jessel” risk takingbeyond the securitized mortgage market had gone in the mid-2000s,long-sacrosanct debt covenants were eased as a classic euphoric global bubbletook hold.24 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber72] By 2007,yield spreads in debt markets overall had narrowed to a point where there waslittle room for further underpricing of risk. A broad measure of credit risk,the yield spread between “junk” bonds rated CCC or lower and ten-year U.S.Treasury notes, fell to an exceptionally low level in the spring of 2007(Exhibit 3.7 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_3_7]). Almost allmarket participants of my acquaintance were aware of the growing risks but werealso cognizant that risk often remained underpriced for years.Financial firms were thus fearful that should they retrench too soon, they wouldalmost surely lose market share, perhaps irretrievably.25[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber73] Their fears were givenexpression in Citigroup Chairman and CEO Charles Prince’s now-famous remark in2007, just before the onset of the crisis, that “when the music stops, in termsof liquidity, things will be complicated. But as long as the music is playing,you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.”26[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber74]The financial firms accepted the risk that they would be unable to anticipatethe onset of crisis in time to retrench. However, they believed that those riskswere limited because when a crisis was clearly at hand, the seemingly insatiabledemand for their array of exotic financial products would dissipate sufficientlyslowly to enable them to sell almost all of their portfolios without loss. Theywere mistaken. They failed to recognize that market liquidity is largely afunction of the degree of risk aversion of investors, clearly the most dominantanimal spirit that drives financial markets. Leading up to the onset of crisis,the lessening in the intensity of risk aversion among investors had producedincreasingly narrow bid-asked credit spreads, backed by heavy volumes (themeasure of liquidity) creating the illusion of being able to sell almostanything. But when fear-induced market retrenchment set in, that “liquidity”disappeared literally overnight as buyers pulled back and offers hitprogressively lower bids. In fact, in many markets, at the height of the crisisof 2008, bids virtually disappeared.As I noted in Chapter 2 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-7.xhtml], some bubbles burstwithout severe economic consequences—the dot-com boom and the rapid run-up ofstock prices in the spring of 1987, for example. Others burst with severedeflationary consequences. The more pernicious class of bubbles, as CarmenReinhart and Kenneth Rogoff demonstrate, appears to be a function of the degreeof leverage in the financial sector, particularly when the maturity of debt isless than the maturity of the assets it funds.27[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber75]Even given the excesses of the GSEs, had the share of financial assets funded byequity been significantly higher in September 2008, arguably the deflation ofasset prices would not have fostered a default contagion, if at all, much beyondthat of the dot-com boom.WHY DID THE BOOM REACH SUCH HEIGHTS?Aside from the excesses of Fannie, Freddie, and of much of the financial sector,why did the 2007 bubble reach century-rare euphoria? The answer, I believe, lieswith the dot-com and 1987 bubbles, which, as I noted in Chapter 2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-7.xhtml], burst with very little footprint on U.S.and global GDP. These two episodes led many in the economics profession and manya sophisticated investor to believe that future contractions would also prove noworse than a typical postwar recession.The need for large-bank capital buffers appeared increasingly less pressingduring the period of great moderation, the years 1983 to 2007, when cyclicalvolatility shrunk perceptibly. The banking regulations adopted internationallyunder Basel I did induce a modest increase in capital requirements well beforethe crisis arose. But the debates in Basel that I attended over the pendingglobal capital accord—so-called Basel II—were largely focused on whether to keepbank capital requirements unchanged or to reduce them. Leverage accordinglyballooned.As I discussed in the Introduction, outsized leverage and financialintermediation in general collapsed on September 15, 2008, engendering possiblythe greatest financial crisis ever. Five months later, with the carnage ofglobal economic activity still under way, I reviewed the forces at play duringthe previous months before the Economic Club of New York. I quote extensivelyfrom that speech because it conveys the contemporaneous fear and yet theemerging critical paths to recovery as the selling climax in global equityprices was only weeks away.We tend to think of fluctuations in stock prices in terms of “paper” profits andlosses somehow not connected to the real world. But the evaporation of the valueof those “paper claims” can have a profoundly deflationary effect on globaleconomic activity. . . .Of course, it is not simple to disentangle the complex sequence of cause andeffect between change in the market value of assets and economic activity. Ifstock prices were wholly reflective of changes in economic variables, movementsin asset prices could be modeled as endogenous and given little attention. Butthey are not. A significant part of stock price dynamics is driven by the innatehuman propensity to intermittently swing between euphoria and fear, which, whileheavily influenced by real economic events, nonetheless has a partial life ofits own. And in my experience, such episodes are often not mere forecasts offuture business activity but are an important cause of that activity.Stock prices are governed through most of the business cycle by profitexpectations and economic activity. They appear to become increasinglyindependent of that activity at turning points. That is the meaning of being aleading indicator, the conclusion of most business cycle analysts.When we look back on this period, I very much suspect that the force that willbe seen to have been most instrumental to global economic recovery will be apartial reversal of the $35 trillion global loss in corporate equity values thathas so devastated financial intermediation. A recovery of the equity marketdriven largely by a receding of fear may well be a seminal turning point of thecurrent crisis.The key issue, of course, is when. Certainly by any historical measure, worldstock prices are cheap. But as history also counsels, they could get a lotcheaper before they turn. What is undeniable is that stock market prices todayare being suppressed by a degree of fear not experienced since the earlytwentieth century (1907 and 1932 come to mind). But history tells us that thereis a limit to how deep, and for how long, fear can paralyze market participants.The pace of economic deterioration cannot persist indefinitely.28[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber76]Shortly thereafter, the market found its bottom and began its ascent. The roleof equity markets in shaping the dynamics of the broader economy is the subjectof the next chapter."},{"pageContent":"FOURSTOCK PRICES AND EQUITY STIMULUSIt was one of those episodes of childhood you never forget: mythirty-four-year-old stockbroker father trying to explain the intricacies ofstock market forecasting to his increasingly befuddled ten-year-old son. As Iremember it, he was very patiently trying to instruct me about how certainpatterns of stock pricing behavior foretold future movements of the Dow JonesIndustrial Average. I couldn’t wait for the tutorial to end so I could get backto perusing numbers I cared about: the batting averages of my favorite baseballheroes—the stalwarts of the New York Yankees. Many years later I still caredabout batting averages, but my father’s passion finally stirred my interest. Inow appreciate the challenge of short-term investing as I have grown torecognize the chart-pricing signals my father used in the 1930s—“head andshoulders,” “descending channel,” and “trading breakouts”—in many of the postwarstock market chartist services that, to this day, attract a large audience.Over my more than six decades of intensive interest, I have encountered very fewconsistently successful stock price forecasting techniques. Many appeared towork for a time but subsequently failed. But are there any guideposts that atleast raise the probability of investment success? Short-term investing iscomplex, and for guidance I defer to chartists (my father would be pleased) whoargue with some validity that market momentum ebbs and flows in definablepatterns. Longer-term strategies, especially “buy and hold,” however, are muchmore promising because stocks have risen from generation to generation almostwithout exception.1 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber77]The S&P 500 composite stock price index has averaged nominal annual increases ofnearly 7 percent from the end of World War II through 2007, and almost neverfailed to log gains over any ten-year time frame. Moreover, prices exhibited notendency, even during our most dramatic post‒World War II bear market (2008), tofall back to even the stock price highs of 1929, and during the stock marketdepths of early 2009, prices were still higher than during the early years ofthe dot-com boom. If bear markets never fully retrace all bull markets (whichthey do not), it necessarily means an ever increasing part of capital gainsbecomes quasi-permanent.Why do stock prices rise so persistently? The bottom line is that over the longrun, stock price-to-earnings ratios, and hence their inverse, earnings-to-stockprice ratios, have no discernible trend going back to at least 1890 (Exhibit 4.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_4_1]). The equity yield peaked in1949 at 16 percent and ranges between 5 percent and 10 percent for most years.The reason for this relative historical stability is that these ratios are tiedto interest rates that reflect our inbred stable time preference (see Chapter 1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-6.xhtml]).2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber78] Corporate earnings aretied to gross corporate product, or more generally, GDP. But GDP over the longrun can be reasonably proxied by the product of the civilian labor force,productivity, and, since 1933, inflation—all of which have persistently grown.Thus, earnings per share and stock prices rise with nominal GDP. Implicit inthese relationships is that common stocks, in addition to being an investment incorporate performance, act as a hedge against inflation as well. Since 1921, forexample, nominal stock prices have risen by 6.0 percent annually, the product ofa 2.6 percent annual inflation rate (in prices of core personal consumptionexpenditures) and a 3.3 percent annual rate of increase in inflation-adjustedearnings.The equity risk premium, calculated as the earnings yield less the real risklesslong-term interest rate, is a measure of the compensation spread that investorsrequire to hold equity rather than riskless bonds (Exhibit 4.2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_4_2]). It is often used to assessthe degree of risk perceived in holding equities. These data recommend aninvestment strategy of concentrating purchases when equity premiums are in theupper bound of their range (that is, when stocks become “cheap” relative totheir earnings and to bonds). Such mechanical trading strategies, if rigorouslyfollowed, displace “intuition” or “gut” trading, which demonstrably is biased byfear and hence is rarely as successful as buy and hold. Even experiencedinvestors and/or speculators have difficulty in overcoming our ingrainedaversion to risk, which is a far more emotionally gripping propensity than itsobverse, euphoria.3 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber79]But not all professional traders are undermined by the biases of stock fundinvestors. There are a handful of professional investors who have hadconsiderable success in amassing large fortunes by, for example, shorting theBritish pound sterling, American subprime mortgage securities, or some exoticderivatives. It is not a trading strategy for the faint of heart.FEAR AND RISK AVERSION ARE DOMINANT PROPENSITIESBut suppressing fear is easier said than done. It is perhaps no accident thatprofessionally managed equity funds have difficulty doing as well as“unemotional” index funds that avoid the biases of human judgment.4[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber80] Fear, even whenintrospectively recognized, can undermine rational investment behavior. I recallmany seasoned investors confessing to me that they sold near the bottom of therecord one-day stock price decline of October 19, 1987, even though theyunderstood that, given history, it was the wrong strategy. The physical painthey felt in seeing their net worth evaporate led them to seek relief bydisengaging from the market.THE UPSIDEThe momentum of euphoria-driven stock price booms, egged on by herd behavior,appears to have been remarkably similar through the past century, though at anincreasingly dampened pace. In the five years preceding the peak of the mostrecent boom (October 2007), for example, stock prices rose at a 12 percentannual rate. In the five years preceding the peak of the dot-com boom (2000),stock prices rose at a 22 percent annual rate. The five-year boom that precededthe peak of 1987 produced an average rise of 24 percent, and the boom prior tothe 1929 crash, an average annual gain of 28 percent. The pace of the rise inbull markets in earlier decades appears more erratic, but on average, somewhatsmaller than the pace of the past eight decades.This is probably as close as we can get to measuring the pace of the systematicbuildup of euphoric herd-driven behavior. In less liquid markets we shouldexpect the degree of tenacity and effectiveness of herd behavior to be smaller,and hence should anticipate a slower rate of euphoric growth. However, to mysurprise, the average annual rate of home price increase in the five yearsleading up to the peak of the housing price bubble, at 12 percent, matched theconcurrent pace of advances in equity prices.THE DOWNSIDEThe inevitable contraction following all bull stock markets initiated andgoverned by fear has been far greater, more diverse, and less predictable thanthe rate of gain during bull markets. Fear, judging solely by the way marketsreact, is certainly a far more intense human propensity than euphoria.5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber81]The degree of fear and euphoria is measured reasonably well by yield spreads,both with respect to credit risks and maturity. The longer the expected life ofa prospective investment, the more uncertain the return and hence the greaterthe rate of discount applied to income from such assets. Disregarding creditrisk, that discount rate should reflect the riskless yield of government bondsof the same maturity. And the difference between the yield on the thirty-yearTreasury obligation and that on a five-year Treasury obligation6[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber82] indicates how severelydiscounting increases with maturity. The effect of heavy discounting oflong-lived assets, primarily buildings, is discussed in Chapter 7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-12.xhtml].The variance of risk on capital investment (see “From Gut to Reason,” page 85)can be proxied by the probability of default indicated by the yield spreadbetween marginal junk bonds (S&P ten-year BB+ interest rates) and ten-yearriskless U.S. Treasury notes. As can be seen in Exhibit 4.3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_4_3], the spread slipped to 2percent during the euphoric stock price and housing booms, only to soar to near9 percent at the height of the post–Lehman crisis. Equally important, both fearand euphoria can also be measured by equity risk premiums.THE LITTLE GUYFear plays an especially dominant role for investors with modest means. Therisk-averse small investor confronts the bias of a gambler who has a small stakeand knows if he loses it, he is out of business. His appetite for risk taking islimited. It is only when an investor’s stake is large that he, or she, cansuffer substantial losses with relative equanimity. In addition, an investorwith large accumulated capital has the resources to disregard periodic marketcrashes, and indeed usually employs such opportunities to build up his or herstock portfolio.ASSET PRICESOnly after many years of involvement with Wall Street did I become aware of howsignificant a role stock prices, or more generally, asset values, play inoverall economic performance. The economic collapse of 2008 reinforced whatprevious experience had clearly shown me: Stock prices are not merely a leadingindicator of business activity but a major contributor to changes in thatactivity.. . . AND THE REAL ECONOMYStock price gyrations have a profound effect not only on financial markets andfinancing but on the real economy as well. Capital gains and losses are keyfactors in the ups and downs of the business cycle. Most pronounced is theireffect on consumer spending. Over the past six decades, the market value of allstocks held by American households and nonprofit organizations directly orindirectly through equity holdings of pension and mutual funds, insurancecompanies, and other financial intermediaries has risen in value by nearly $20trillion. The historical data strongly support the view that a rise in themarket value of stocks held, for example, in 401k pension funds throughcontributions or quasi-permanent capital gains will induce households to spendpart of their gains on personal consumption expenditures.7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber83] The empirical resultsdeveloped in the appendix suggest that approximately 2.1 cents of every dollarin the equity holdings of households (on average during a year), 3.0 cents ofevery dollar of market value of equity in owner-occupied homes, and 2.0 cents ofassets accumulated otherwise are spent, during that year, on personalconsumption expenditures (Exhibit 4.4[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_4_4]). These data do not do much toclarify whether, as many analysts believe, a dollar in home equity gains has agreater effect on consumption expenditures than a dollar of stock market capitalgains. The Federal Reserve has long argued that there is no significantdifference. My result does indicate a higher propensity to spend out of homeequity than stock equity—but the difference is only marginally significant. Infact, data for the years 1953 to 2012 indicate that, on average, 12 perccent ofpersonal consumption expenditures were determined by increases in net worth. Theremaining 88 percent were determined by the level of disposable personal incomeand short-term savings rates (see Exhibit 4.5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_4_5]).8[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber84] Nonetheless, analysts,myself included (in this book), still measure the rate of savings of a householdas a percent of income only. Before econometricians discovered these importantrelationships, I, and I assume others as well, assumed that only disposableincome determined personal consumption expenditures.Moreover, changes in prices of owner-occupied homes affect not only expendituresby households on goods and services, but along with long-term mortgage rates,are a major factor in the decision of homebuilders to construct new homes.9[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber85] Homebuilding, however,does not appear to be significantly affected by stock prices, with the possibleexception of the stock price of a homebuilder’s own company.GOVERNMENT RESPONDS TO CAPITAL GAINSAsset prices have a measurable effect not only on consumption expenditures andprivate capital investment but also on government outlays as well.Municipalities that depend heavily on property taxes do ratchet spending up anddown as the market values of assessable properties fluctuate. As federal budgetreceipts rise from taxed capital gains and stock option grants, the fiscalstatus of the government improves, creating leeway for Congress to spend more.The dot-com boom, for example, produced the budget surpluses of 1998 to 2001 forthe federal government and many states. No elected officials in modern timesseem to resist being enticed by unexpected surplus cash sitting around,uncommitted. But outside of the extremes of boom and bust, the effect of moreworkaday fluctuations of asset prices on ups and downs in federal spending issurely minimal.In summary: In Exhibit 4.6 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_4_6], Itrace the overall effect of year-over-year changes in equity values (with aone-quarter lead) on year-over-year changes in real GDP.10[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber86] I find that between 1970and 2012, a 10 percent increase in the market value of holdings of U.S.residents of stocks, bonds, homeowners’ equity, and other assets is associatedwith an annual change in real GDP of 1.3 percentage points.EQUITY STIMULUSSince 1952, the combination of equity from stocks and homes has averaged a netannual gain of 7.5 percent.11[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber87] The American economy thushas been “stimulated” by equity in a manner similar to the way fiscal stimulusaffects GDP. Both, of course, require debt to convert the programs intospendable funds. Government deficits are funded by government debt. Privaterealized capital gains cannot be monetized and spent without incurring privatedebt or issuing stock. But there are, of course, important differences. Fiscalstimulus is initiated by deliberate action of government. Equity stimulus is aresult of private sector decision making, the economic consequences of which canbe affected by government actions for good or ill. In Chapter 7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-12.xhtml], I compare the contribution of fiscalstimulus to the economic recovery of 2009 with that of equity stimulus.CAPITAL EXPENDITURESI was a director of fifteen listed corporations at various times in the quartercentury before I joined the Federal Reserve. I cannot remember a single instancewhen a chairman12 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber88]presented a new capital project to his board and cited the corporation’s risingstock price as a determining factor for authorizing a capital expenditure. Yetthe data unambiguously indicate that the market value of corporate equities(stock prices) is an important determinant of capital spending (see Box 4.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-9.xhtml#box_4_1]).BOX 4.1: STOCK PRICES AND CAPITAL SPENDINGIn a paper I published in 1959,13[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber89] I related the ratio of themarket value of existing U.S. corporate net assets (stock prices) to thereplacement cost of those assets (the price of newly produced private plant andequipment).14 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber90] In thesimplest example of this process, a new office building will tend to be fundedif the market value of contiguous office buildings significantly exceeds theexpected construction cost of the new investment. (See “Asset Prices,” page 80.)The ratio of stock price to cost of construction of capital assets correlatedquite well with machinery orders (capital investment) going back into the 1920s.I recently updated the 1959 analysis and was amazed at how well this simplerelationship still works, even tracing the recent years’ sharp fluctuations inreal private capital investment (Exhibit 4.7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_4_7]). Since 1993, for example, a10 percent change in stock prices relative to the cost of replacing plant andequipment from scratch has been associated with a 4 percent change in realcapital expenditures relative to the stock of fixed assets.I know of no corporate executives who explicitly determine a corporation’s totalcapital budget based on such calculations, but implicitly they all do.HOW IT’S DONEIn theory, to optimize the long-term market value of a firm, the ultimate goalof corporate investment, corporate executives need to simultaneously considerthe entire universe of potential investments: their prospective rates of returnand whether they should be funded wholly by equity, wholly by debt, or somecombination of the two. This implies, for example, that all capital projects beidentified and evaluated for any year on January 1, and then managementcontinually reevaluate throughout the year all the assumptions that went intothe initial conclusions as new evidence inevitably emerges. But no corporateexecutive committee has the ability to go through that exercise.In practice, as a rough approximation of the theoretically optimal procedure,most corporations constrain capital spending to the level of cash flow, adjustedfor the preferred degree of leverage (or de-leverage) of their balance sheet.These choices reflect management’s general level of confidence about the futureover the time frame of prospective capital investments. Of course, all capitalbudgets are made up of myriad individual investment projects that must beevaluated.FROM GUT TO REASONThe cap-ex ratio (capital expenditures as a share of cash flow) captures theessence of business investment decision making. But how do corporate managersmake such judgments? In years past, it was too often the “gut feel” of the CEO(not to be probed further). In more recent decades, the process has become moreformal, though gut feel (intuition) has never been fully discarded (see Chapter1 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-6.xhtml]).The investment process obviously differs from company to company, but all,especially larger corporations, follow more or less the same approach. Forexample, the executives of an oil company contemplating whether to expandcapacity may instruct the company’s technical and marketing people to create abest estimate of the potential future market and profitability of a newlyintroduced petrochemical feedstock over the expected life of the proposedproduction facility.If that rate of return exceeds the corporation’s cost of raising new equitycapital and is within the bounds of any overall corporate leverage constraint,15[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber91] the analysis then proceedsto stage two. What is the expected range, or variance, of best estimateoutcomes? This judgment, as I have observed over the years, largely determineswhether the investment is implemented. An investment with a respectable 20percent average annual expected rate of return could nonetheless be rejected ifthe long-term outlook is so cloudy that the range of that estimate is, forexample, between negative 20 percent and positive 60 percent.The fewer the variables that need to be evaluated in making a forecast, thenarrower the range of possibilities and the lower the variance. A cloudedbusiness climate owing to an uncertain outlook of future tax regimes, forexample, obviously increases investment outcome variance by adding newuncertainties to the decision-making process. That can, and usually does, exacta toll on the level of a company’s capital investments. Some uncertainties canbe ameliorated by slightly altering the nature and terms of a project. While thecalculation of the expected rate of return is straightforward, the determinationof the level of variance that is acceptable is not. In my experience, therelative skills in making variance judgments determine to a large extent whichcompanies are most successful.The ratio of capital investment to cash flow is thus not only an importantmeasure of the level of corporate confidence, but it is also a useful indicatorof corporation leverage. The acceptable degree of overall corporate leverage isrevealed in the choice of total capital expenditures’ share of cash flow (thecap-ex ratio).16 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber92] Acorporation that finances capital expenditures wholly with cash flow, that is,with no net borrowing, has a ratio of 1.0.17[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber93] A ratio exceeding 1.0defines the degree of increase in leverage. A ratio less than 1.0 indicates thedegree of de-leveraging. For nonfinancial corporate business between 1952 and2007, for example, the (unweighted) average of that ratio was 1.05, with all ofthe annual observations falling between 0.82 and 1.29 (excluding 1974). Thus,some net borrowing, on average, is associated with corporate investment.Corporate managers are always aware of the value of the equity buffers thatstand between debt and bankruptcy as they set the appropriate amount of leveragethat their corporation will take on.CORPORATE CULTUREDuring my tenure as a director of JPMorgan (just prior to joining the FederalReserve), I was impressed by the value the bank accorded to its AAA rating. Theyrecognized that in the short run, they could achieve a higher return on equitythrough increased leverage. But they feared that that could lower the bank’s AAArating, an important factor in their long-term ability to attract low-costliabilities. Most important, the rating was required to sustain a reputation forprudence, an essential characteristic of their historic franchise that datedback to the time of John Pierpont Morgan himself. Similar considerations led toconstrained leverage on the part of many nonfinancial corporations for which Ihave worked over the years.Most firms will borrow only so much, even though they recognize they may beforgoing profitable opportunities by failing to more fully leverage certaininvestments (a reluctance far greater than is evident among financial firms).This business reluctance to borrow beyond a determined limit relative to cashflow is evident in Exhibit 7.2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_7_2]. Because investment less cashflow is necessarily equal to net borrowing, the data indicate a relativelynarrow range of leverage. This is true for business in general. If at anyinterest rate or level of cultural restraint business borrows less, governmentsare free to borrow more.Regression analysis indicates that higher mortgage rates suppress home prices(Exhibit 3.3 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_3_3]), and home pricesare critically tied to home investment (Exhibit 7.4[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_7_4]). That accounts for about afourth of crowding out of private investment. I suspect that interest ratesuppression of less than investment grade companies accounts for a significantadditional amount. But in general it appears that roughly half of thedisplacement of gross private savings by budget deficits can be attributed tointerest rate crowding out, and the residual other half to corporate culturerestraints.Both crowding out owing to elevated interest rates and crowding out owing tocorporate culture restraints in the end come out in the same place. Elevatedcosts of funding will often render a relevant prospective investmentunprofitable. But that is also what occurs when an individual companyself-limits its degree of leverage. Even triple-A firms restrict their debtissuance, and that implies that certain contemplated investments are stillborn.A company with very little debt has considerable leeway to leverage and maximizethe rate of return on equity. It can thus accept a relatively low potentialoperating rate of return18 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber94]and, through leverage, bring the return on equity up to a satisfactory level. Afirm with an already high degree of leverage does not have that opportunity.Since it cannot borrow, it needs a higher operating rate of return. Therefore,other things equal, an already highly leveraged firm will invest and borrow lessthan a firm not so debt encumbered. In the end, it behaves like an unleveragedfirm inhibited by a rise in interest rates.To be sure, that’s not the way investment judgments are made in the textbooks onoptimum capital allocation. Human propensities too often warp objective decisionmaking. But most large firms do adhere to a rigorous paradigm. In my experience,most medium- and, especially, smaller-sized companies do not. When they reach acertain debt level, they behave as though they were crowded out by higher rates.A model that fails to embody such economic forces (and most do not) misses animportant constraint on the forecast results."},{"pageContent":"FIVEFINANCE AND REGULATION1 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber95]In recent years, the ongoing debate on the merits of capitalism has homed in ona crucial pillar: Adam Smith’s fundamental premise of free markets, the ideathat people acting in their own self-interest spur competition that advancessociety as a whole.2 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber96] Inthe purest form of that paradigm is the idea that markets are essentiallyself-regulating.Although I always have been, and remain, a strong supporter of free marketcapitalism, my support is not based on the belief that all market participantsbehave solely in their own rational self-interest at all times. As someonebrought up in the canyons of Wall Street, I saw too much of what we now describeas the influence of animal spirits to entertain such a view.3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber97] I nonetheless found thebroad success of free markets, with all their shortcomings, intellectually andempirically too compelling to ignore and the arguments for alternative economicsystems flawed and unpersuasive.I believed in years past that the aberrations from rationality andefficiency—often reflecting the effects of animal spirits—were sufficientlyinfrequent and random to evoke little more than economic noise. I was thusespecially shaken by the breakdown in 2008, which could scarcely becharacterized as economic noise. Moreover, it had an eerie historicalfamiliarity about it—1929 and 1907 for example. Did these breakdowns reflect“noise” or some systematic propensity of human nature? The crack in my view ofthe economic world manifested itself in a widespread failure of one of the mostimportant pillars of a stable market economy, whose roots lay deep in postwaracademia: rational financial risk management.I noted in an op-ed piece early in the crisis, “those of us who look to theself-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholder equity have to bein a state of shocked disbelief.”4[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber98] That episode led me torethink my view of the importance of animal spirits. And in the aftermath of thefailure of financial risk management, I was led to conclude that a tightening ofregulatory capital standards was long overdue.The events of the crisis demonstrated that financial managers could not becounted on to maintain an equity buffer adequate to withstand a broad range ofeconomic outcomes. The willingness of many financial firms to allow theirtangible capital, at the height of the boom, to become razor thin was a follylargely explained by herd behavior and an underestimation of the ephemeralnature of market liquidity. The financial and economic instability that followedin its wake induced a sharp political response toward increased regulation, mostnotably in the form of the Dodd-Frank Act. In political terms, that response wasunderstandable. The problem is that substituting government regulations israrely an improvement and, indeed, as I note later, if overdone, turns out to becounterproductive. As poorly as certain private financial managers performedleading up to the crisis of 2008, government regulators fared no better (seeChapter 2 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-7.xhtml]).FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION AND REGULATIONThe Purpose of FinanceThe role of regulation in a market economy is determined by the nature of whatis being regulated. The ultimate goal of a financial system in a market economy,for example, is to direct the nation’s savings (including depreciation5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber99]), plus any savingsborrowed from abroad (the current account deficit), toward investments in plant,equipment, and human capital that offer the largest risk-adjusted returns oncapital and presumably the greatest increases in the nation’s output per workerhour. Nonfinancial output per hour, on average, rises when obsolescentfacilities (with low output per hour) are replaced with facilities that embodycutting-edge technologies (with high output per hour). This process improvesaverage standards of living for a nation as a whole. There is no alternative towhat Joseph Schumpeter aptly called “creative destruction.” In the UnitedStates, the success of finance through the last decades of the twentieth centuryin directing our scarce savings into real productive capital investments mayexplain the generous compensation that nonfinancial market participants had beenwilling to pay to the domestic producers of financial services (see Box 5.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-10.xhtml#box_5_1]).BOX 5.1: COMPENSATIONPrior to my Federal Reserve tenure I spent a good deal of my time as a directorof a number of American corporations, large and small, including two banks and asavings and loan holding company. In The Age of Turbulence (page 426), Icomplained about the consultants hired by corporations to advise boards ofdirectors on corporate compensation packages. I was distressed that all seemedto be arguing that boards of directors needed to offer above-averagecompensation. It is a neat trick to get everyone doing better than the averageof all. At the same time, it has been my experience serving as a consultant and,at times, as a director of many large financial corporations that smalldifferences in the skill level of senior bankers tend to translate into largedifferences in the bank’s bottom line. Competition for even the slightly moreskilled is accordingly fierce. Senior bankers operate as largely independententities whose “clients” are often more theirs than the banks’; they leave withthe “star” when he or she changes organization. It is doubtful that legislationcan work in such an arena. My experiences in such issues have made me skeptical,and data do indirectly support such skepticism. If directors, in seeking bankexecutives, believe that senior officers of the bank contribute to the bank’sbottom line, you would expect the bank’s executive compensation to mirror themarket value of the bank. The larger the bank, the greater the dollar gains andlosses from management decisions. I have not tried to match the figures bank bybank, but the aggregate CEO compensation of the S&P 500 corporations, a goodproxy, does exhibit a surprising stability over time with the market value ofthe firms (Exhibit 5.1 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_5_1]).The share of U.S. gross domestic product accruing as income to the privatefinance and insurance sectors rose fairly steadily from 2.4 percent in 1947 to7.9 percent in 2012 (Exhibit 5.2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_5_2]).6[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber100] Many other globalfinancial centers exhibit similar trends.7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber101] Only a small part of therise of U.S. finance and insurance represented an increase in net foreign demandfor U.S. financial and insurance services.8[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber102] Income accruing tofinance and insurance results from their services being purchased bynonfinancial firms and foreign businesses. These are consolidated figures. Bankscannot generate income by trading with themselves.A Misread?Given the historic breakdown of 2008, did nonfinancial market participants overthe decades misread the efficiency of finance and inappropriately compensatethis segment of our economy? The prevalence of so many financial productfailures during the crisis certainly suggests so. The share of finance andinsurance in GDP, at 8.2 percent in 2006, fell back to 7.3 percent in 2008, thelowest level since 1999. But it bounced back sharply in the following years,moving to 8.0 percent in 2010 and 7.9 percent in 2012. The demand for financialservices prior to 2008 was apparently not a misread of the efficiency offinance.The proportion of nonfarm employment accounted for by finance and insurancesince 1947 has risen far less than the share of gross income originating in thatsector. This implies a significant upgrading of the salaries paid by financialinstitutions. There is little doubt that highly skilled mathematicians, modelbuilders, and number crunchers have flocked to finance.9[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber103] By 2007, a quarter of allgraduates of the venerable California Institute of Technology were enteringfinance, according to the Economist.10[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber104]What are we to make of these extraordinarily persistent and stable uptrends? Isit wholly accidental? (After all, there is no evidence of such a trend in theprewar years.) The rising value of assets to be managed accounts for part, butonly part, of the increase.11[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber105] The answer to thisquestion matters because in the context of financial reform, we must addresswhether the growing share was evidence that a rise in financial services wasrequired to intermediate an ever more complex American division of labor.Alternatively, the growing share of finance in the economy could reflectproblems with the structure of, and incentives surrounding, those people workingin the financial industry.I raise the issue because many policy recommendations in the Dodd-Frank Act seemlikely to result in a diminished share of financial services income in GDP.Would such policies affect the growth of U.S. nonfinancial productivity and,with it, our standards of living? More important, given the recent failures ofrisk management and regulation, could increased financial regulation at thistime thwart or, through increased stability, enhance economic growth? We need afar deeper understanding of the role of financial intermediation in promotinggrowth to answer that question. The Dodd-Frank Act does not, in my judgment,address those issues. I explained my general concern with the act in March 2011,worrying that “it fails to capture the degree of global interconnectedness ofrecent decades which has not been substantially altered by the crisis of 2008.The act may create the largest regulatory-induced market distortion sinceAmerica’s ill-fated imposition of wage and price controls in 1971.”12[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber106] More than two years laterI have seen nothing to alter that appraisal.How finance evolves in the postcrisis years should bring clarity to many oftoday’s uncertainties. We have to assume that the greater the level of capitalthat financial institutions are required to hold, the less the degree offinancial intermediation. That, in turn, is likely to result in slower growth,but presumably more financial stability and less risk of a breakdown in thefinancial structure of the magnitude of 2008.Risky Financial IntermediationAs I noted earlier, prior to the crisis, the size of the modeled extremenegative tail of the distribution of risks failed to reflect the reality thatemerged with the default of Lehman. So long as there are bank debt obligations,there will always be some risk that bank capital cannot cover, and if that riskmaterializes, some, perhaps even many, banks will fail.But that need not become a systemic problem if equity capital and liquidityrequirements are raised sufficiently and/or a significant part of anintermediary’s debt takes the form of mandated contingent convertible (CoCo)bonds—that is, debt that is automatically converted to equity when equitycapital falls below a certain threshold. Still, we must consider the possibilitythat private financial intermediaries will falter, with systemic consequences ofa magnitude that requires sovereign credit to keep vital intermediationfunctioning. Short of the elimination of all debt, risk of default can neverfall to zero so long as financial intermediaries require leverage (debt) toobtain an adequate return on equity capital.Central bankers are always aware of the potential for a breakdown in privatefinancial markets. Indeed, in the United States as recently as 1991, incontemplation of the unthinkable and at the urging of the Federal Reserve Board,section 13 (3) of the Federal Reserve Act was reconsidered and amended byCongress. The section, as revised, granted virtually unlimited authority to theboard to lend in “unusual and exigent circumstances,” the statutory basis ofmuch postcrisis economic intervention.13[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber107] More than a decade ago,addressing that issue, I noted:There is a . . . difficult problem of risk management that central bankersconfront every day, whether we explicitly acknowledge it or not: How much of theunderlying risk in a financial system should be shouldered [solely] by banks andother financial institutions? . . . [Central banks] have all chosen implicitly,if not in a more overt fashion, to set our capital and other reserve standardsfor banks to guard against outcomes that exclude those once or twice in acentury crises that threaten the stability of our domestic and internationalfinancial systems.I do not believe any central bank explicitly makes this calculation. But we havechosen capital standards that by any stretch of the imagination cannot protectagainst all potential adverse loss outcomes. There is implicit in this exercisethe admission that, in certain episodes, problems at commercial banks and otherfinancial institutions, when their risk-management systems prove inadequate,will be handled by central banks [sovereign credit]. At the same time, societyon the whole should require that we set this bar very high. Hundred-year floodscome only once every hundred years. Financial institutions should expect to lookto the central bank only in extremely rare situations.14[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber108]At issue is whether the crisis that arrived a few years later is thathundred-year flood. At best, once-in-a-century observations yield results fromwhich it is difficult to draw robust conclusions. But recent evidence suggeststhat what happened in the wake of the Lehman collapse, as I noted earlier, isamong the most severe global financial crises ever, if not the most. In theGreat Depression, of course, the collapse in economic output and the rise inunemployment and destitution far exceeded that in the 2008 crisis. And, ofcourse, the widespread bank failures of the Great Depression era markedlyreduced short-term credit availability. But short-term financial marketscontinued to function.Financial crises are characterized by a progressive inability to float firstlong-term debt, then eventually short-term debt, and finally overnight debt.Long-term uncertainty, and therefore risks, are always greater than near-termrisks, and hence risk spreads almost always increase with the maturity of thefinancial instrument in question.15[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber109] While widespread economichavoc can be spread by a collapse in asset prices, I find that the depth of afinancial crisis is best characterized by the degree of collapse in theavailability of short-term credit.One has to dig very deep into peacetime financial history to uncover episodessimilar to 2008. The market for call money, the key short-term financing vehicleof a century ago, shut down at the peak of the 1907 panic “when no call moneywas offered at all for one day and the [bid] rate rose from 1 to 125%.”16[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber110] Even at the height of the1929 stock market crisis, the call money market functioned, although annualinterest rates did soar to 20 percent. In lesser financial crises, availabilityof funds in the longer-term markets disappeared, but overnight and othershort-term markets continued to function.The withdrawal of overnight money represents financial stringency at itsmaximum. Investors must be willing to lend overnight before they feelsufficiently protected by adequate capital to reach out for more distant, andhence riskier, maturities.The evaporation of short-term credits, especially trade credits, in September2008 was global and all encompassing. But it was, on a much grander scale, thesame process that I had previously observed at a more micro level. As the creditof New York City became suspect in the mid-1970s, the first failure of issuancewas evident in long-term municipal bonds, followed by failures in progressivelyshorter maturities, until even overnight markets started to crumble. A similarprogression led up to the Mexican financial crisis of 1994‒95.REGULATORY REFORMPrinciples of ReformGiven the recent unprecedented period of turmoil, by what standard shouldproposals for reform of official supervision and regulation be judged? I know ofno form of economic organization, from unfettered laissez-faire to oppressivecentral planning, that has succeeded in achieving both maximum sustainableeconomic growth and permanent stability. Central planning certainly failed, andI strongly doubt, given the foibles of human nature, that complete stability isachievable in capitalist economies. The latter are governed by analways-turbulent competition driven by fear, euphoria, and herd behavior. Incapitalist economies, however, markets do tend to be drawn toward, but neverquite achieve, an equilibrium that is continually shifting.Although there are often multiple objectives of regulation, when it can identifyand inhibit irrational behavior, under certain conditions, regulation can bestabilizing. But there is an insidious cost of regulation in terms of economicgrowth and standards of living when it reaches beyond containing unproductivebehavior. Parenthetically, I do not consider addressing fraud to be regulation.Rampant fraud can significantly diminish the effectiveness of marketcompetition, but fraud is theft and an issue of law enforcement.Growth Versus StabilityRegulation by definition imposes restraints on competitive markets. The elusivepoint of balance between growth and stability has often been a point ofcontention, especially when it comes to financial regulation.During the postwar years prior to the crisis, with the exception of a limitednumber of bank bailouts (Continental Illinois in 1984, for example), privatecapital proved adequate to cover virtually all provisions for commercial banklending losses.17 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber111] As aconsequence, there was never a definitive test of the precrisis conventionalwisdom that an equity capital-to-assets ratio of 6 to 10 percent on average (therange that prevailed between 1946 and 2003) was adequate to support the U.S.banking system. Risk managers’ assumption of the size and configuration of thenegative tails of the distributions of credit and interest rate risk were, as Inoted earlier, of necessity conjectural, and we had not had a test of thoseconjectures for many decades.Most of the shape of the perceived distribution of risk of outcomes wasdeveloped from data gathered in the precrisis years, which included only“moderate” financial turbulence and mild euphorias. But since compilation ofmodern financial data began, we never had experienced a “hundred-year flood”that revealed the severe consequences of a shock in the negative tail of theprobability distribution.Risk managers, of course, knew in earlier decades that an assumption of“normality” in the distribution of risk was unrealistic,18[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber112] but because thisapproximation greatly facilitated calculation, it prevailed. Even as themathematics implied by fat tails began to be better understood, ournumber-crunching capabilities fell far short of making the required calculationsto guide practical actions, except at prohibitive cost. That is no longer thecase.Clearly what we observed in the weeks following the Lehman default is exactlythe type of market seizure that conjecture about so-called fat tails wassupposed to capture, and in practice did not. Having experienced Lehman, riskmanagers will be far more cautious in evaluating future risk—at least for awhile.19 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber113]Indeed, the Lehman default and its aftermath strongly suggest that the negativetails of the risk distribution were considerably larger than almost anybody hadearlier imagined. The failure of risk managers to fully understand the effect ofthe emergence of shadow banking may have been partly responsible for theunderestimation of systemic financial risk. Shadow banking was a form offinancial innovation that may well have increased rather than moderated theoverall level of risk. The creditors of these shadow banks were not beingadequately compensated by higher capital buffers for the added risk posed bythese entities.The Illusion of Market LiquidityWhen risk premiums are low over a protracted period, as they were, for example,from 1993 to 1998 and from 2003 to 2007, investors’ willingness to actively bidfor all types of financial assets, such as the high-risk tranches ofcollateralized debt obligations, creates an illusion of permanent marketliquidity. In the latest episode, this turned out to be especially intoxicating.It led several major investment banks to sail into the financial storm withfinancing that depended on a level of liquidity that was about to vanish.The Needed ReformsThus, the most pressing needed reforms in the aftermath of the crisis, in myjudgment, are fixes to the levels of regulatory risk-adjusted capital,liquidity, and collateral standards required by counterparties.20[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber114] Private marketparticipants are now requiring economic capital and balance sheet liquidity wellin excess of Basel requirements. The shadow banks that survived the crisis noware having to meet significantly tighter market standards set by theircounterparties, with respect to capital, liquidity, and collateral, than existedbefore the crisis. Likewise, global regulators will need to assess requiredchanges to capital and liquidity standards to better protect against systemicbreakdowns.All risk-adjusted capital adequacy measures need to be raised and dueconsideration needs to be given to the proportion of liabilities funded withovernight or other short-term debt. Regulatory capital requirements prior to thecrisis, although based on decades of experience, were clearly too lax. Homemortgages were perceived as far safer than they, in retrospect, turned out tobe. And, unfortunately, a large proportion of investment portfolio decisionswas, by law, accorded “safe harbor” status if those decisions adhered to thecredit risk judgments (or rather, misjudgments) of the credit-rating agencies.To ensure that financial intermediaries have adequate cash to meet ongoingcommitments in the event of a shutdown in external funding, internationalregulation of bank liquidity should match the tightening already evident inprivate risk management paradigms. Collateral (customer assets) has shown itselfparticularly subject to rapid recapture. Bear Stearns had nearly $20 billion inpledgeable liquid funds a week before it collapsed. Morgan Stanley lost morethan a half trillion dollars of pledgeable collateral during the height of thecrisis. In the United States, to lower the risk of a “run on the broker,” theamount of customer assets held by broker-dealers that cannot be commingled withtheir own assets needs to be increased. That would decrease the amount of fundsthat can “run.” However, such action must be measured and coordinated with otherglobal regulators to avoid regulatory arbitrage.Hedge FundsUnaffiliated hedge funds have weathered the crisis—as extreme a real-life stresstest as one can construct—without taxpayer assistance or, as I noted earlier,default. Although hedge funds are only lightly regulated, much of theirleveraged funding comes from more heavily regulated banks. Moreover, asSebastian Mallaby wrote, “Most hedge funds make money by driving prices awayfrom extremes and toward their rational level.”21[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber115] In so doing, they supplymuch-needed liquidity to financial markets when other competitors havewithdrawn. Regulations that inhibit the ability of hedge funds to supply suchservices have the potential to be counterproductive.Capital, liquidity, and collateral, in my experience, address almost all of thefinancial regulatory structure shortcomings exposed by the onset and aftermathof the crisis. In retrospect, there has to have been a level of capital thatwould have prevented the failure of, for example, Bear Stearns and LehmanBrothers. (If not 10 percent capital, think of partnerships with 40 percentcapital.) Moreover, generic loan loss reserves have the regulatory advantage ofnot having to forecast which particular financial products are about to turntoxic.22 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber116] Certainly, veryfew investors foresaw the future of subprime securities or the myriad otherbroken products. Adequate generic capital eliminates the need for anunachievable specificity in regulatory standards.The jerry-built regulatory structure that has evolved over the decades in theUnited States has become much too complex. During the debates that led tolegislation resulting in a badly needed opening up of financial competition (theGramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999), policy makers and lawmakers nonetheless failedto recognize that increased competition—especially through shadow banking—alsoincreased negative tail risk.23[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber117] And increased negativetail risk necessitates higher capital requirements.Much, though not all, of what advocates of broadened oversight of consumerfinance are combating falls under the scope of fraud. Again, this is not theprovince of regulation but of enhanced law enforcement. Misrepresentation, themajor source of consumer complaints, is fraud and should be readily addressed inmore widespread enforcement of existing law.Upward Revisions of Bank Economic CapitalHow much capital counterparties require of financial institutions shouldinfluence regulatory capital requirements. It is probably too soon to havedefinitive long-term answers. But very rough approximations for U.S. commercialbanks can be inferred from the response of bank credit default swaps (CDS), amarket measure of bank insolvency risk, to postcrisis events.24[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber118] (See Box 5.2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-10.xhtml#box_5_2].)BOX 5.2: BANK CAPITALMovements in the CDS market should also give us some direct insight into whenthe banking system is perceived to have overcome the market’s still prevalentfear of widespread insolvency—and beyond that, to when markets perceive thatbanks will feel sufficiently secure to return to the free lending of theprecrisis years.Starting late in 2008 and accelerating into the first quarter of 2009, the U.S.Treasury, through its Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), added $250 billionto bank equity, the equivalent of adding approximately 2 percentage points tothe equity capital-to-assets ratio. The effect of this added capital wasconsequential and immediate.As the financial crisis took hold and deepened, the unweighted average spread offive-year CDSs of six major U.S. banks—Bank of America, JPMorgan, Citigroup,Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and Morgan Stanley—rose from 14 basis points inearly 200725 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber119] to 170 basispoints just before the Lehman default on September 15, 2008. In response to theLehman default, the five-year CDS average price rose to more than 430 basispoints by October 10. On the day the TARP was announced (October 14), the pricefell to 211 basis points, or essentially by half (Exhibit 5.3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_5_3]). In other words, a2-percentage-point addition to the banks’ book equity capital-to-assets ratioreversed roughly half the crisis surge in the price of five-year CDSs. Weshouldn’t make too much of this, but we shouldn’t make too little of it either;it’s a real data point in an argument that has precious few of them. If weassume a linear extrapolation, which is admittedly a big assumption, thisimplies an overall additional 4-percentage-point rise (from nearly 10 percent atthe end of the third quarter of 2008 to 14 percent ultimately) in the equitycapital cushion required by market participants to fund the liabilities ofbanks. (This also presumes, of course, that the probability of a TARP before theLehman default was de minimis. The abruptness of the market reaction to the TARPannouncement appears to confirm such a presumption.)Current book equity-to-assets ratios are still far from 14 percent. The averageratio for commercial banks (as reported by the FDIC) was 11.4 percent on March31, 2013, compared with 9.4 percent in late 2008. That banks still have moreequity capital to add in order to return the market’s perception of risk toprecrisis levels is also indicated by the fact that the five-year CDS priceremained around 100 basis points in the spring of 2013, which was stillsignificantly elevated relative to the 14 basis points that prevailed in early2007, when 10 percent capital prevailed.26[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber120]There is little doubt that the TARP’s cash injection markedly reduced the fearof bank default through early 2009. More difficult to judge is the effect onbank CDSs of the dramatic increase in bank equity at market value relative tobank assets at market value. That ratio rose from 7.3 percent at the end ofMarch 2009 to 11.6 percent at the end of December 2009 (Exhibit 5.4[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_5_4]). (Bank capital-to-assetratios are typically quoted in book value terms, which is to say the value basedon established accounting conventions. Market value is simply the stock price[per share] times the number of shares outstanding.)Higher market values of bank equity have materially increased the solvency ofbanks, though far less effectively, dollar for dollar, than a more permanentchange in book value equity. CDS prices, which reflect the probability ofdefault, can be used as a basic arbiter of whether book or market value of bankequity is the more relevant measure of buffer against default. CDS prices andbank stock prices are highly correlated, of course. But statisticallysignificant regression analysis indicates that only one fourth of a change inthe ratio of bank equity to bank assets at market value translates to the bookvalue equivalent of that ratio. This is wholly understandable given that marketvalues are more ephemeral than book values. Presumably only a fourth of marketchange is assumed to be a permanent increase in the buffer to default, measuredby book value.Much of the repayment of the 2008 TARP investments to the U.S. Treasury wasdoubtless financed by new equity issuance. That new equity issuance was, inturn, made possible by a more than half-trillion-dollar increase in the marketvalue of U.S. commercial bank equity and by borrowings made much easier (andcheaper) by the increased equity buffer engendered by gains in market-valuedbank equity. The parceling of relative contributions of the TARP and of capitalgains to bank solvency and willingness to lend may not be fully clear even inretrospect.The TARP not only inserted capital but also induced market participants to inferthat the U.S. Treasury would, at least for a while, stand behind the liabilitiesof the banking system. This may explain the divergence since mid-September 2009between short-term (one- and three-month) London Interbank Offered Rate lessovernight indexed swap rates (LIBOR-OIS) spreads (an alternative to CDS spreadsas a short-term measure of the likelihood of bank default) and five- andten-year CDS spreads. Short-term LIBOR-OIS spreads had returned to theirprecrisis level by the end of September 2009. Long-maturity CDS prices are, asyet, only partway back (Exhibit 5.5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_5_5]). The one-year LIBOR-OISspread falls in between. Clearly, markets are discounting some of the rise inthe bank capital cushion at market value five and ten years hence. Thatdiscounting likely reflects the perceived increased volatility of stock pricesand the uncertainty surrounding the political willingness, or ability, of theU.S. government, after markets return to normal, to initiate another bankbailout.27 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber121]Given the foregoing set of fragile assumptions and conclusions (they are all wehave), I would judge that regulatory equity capital requirements in the end willbe seen to have risen from the 10 percent precrisis level (in terms of bookvalue) to 13 percent or 14 percent by 2015, and liquidity and collateralrequirements will toughen commensurately.What Supervision and Regulation Can DoWhat, in my experience, supervision and examination can do as backup to capitalrequirements and counterparty surveillance is promulgate rules that arepreventative and are not predicated on regulators being able to accuratelypredict an uncertain future.SUPERVISION * can audit and enforce capital and liquidity requirements, * can require that financial institutions issue some contingent convertible debt that will become equity should equity capital become impaired, * can put limits or prohibitions on certain types of concentrated bank lending, * can inhibit the reconsolidation of affiliates previously sold to investors, especially structured investment vehicles (SIVs),28 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber122] and * can require “living wills” in which financial intermediaries indicate, on an ongoing basis, how they can be liquidated expeditiously with minimum effect on counterparties and markets.Some Lessons of Equity Capital HistoryIn the late nineteenth century, U.S. banks needed to carry equity capital of 30percent of assets to attract sufficient deposits and other forms of borrowing tofund their assets. In the pre‒Civil War period, that figure topped 50 percent(Exhibit 2.1 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_2_1]). Given therudimentary nature of payment systems and the poor geographical distribution ofbank reserves in what was then an agricultural economy, competition for bankcredit was largely local. It enabled national banks, on average, to obtainreturns (net income) on their assets of well over 200 basis points in the late1880s, and probably more than 300 basis points in the 1870s (compared with 70basis points a century later).The increasing efficiency of financial intermediation, owing to theconsolidation of reserves and improvements in payment systems that allowedcapital-to-assets ratios to decline, exerted competitive pressure on profitspreads to narrow. Accordingly, the annual average net income rate of return onequity was amazingly stable, rarely falling outside a range of 5 to 10 percent,measured annually, during the near century from 1869 to 1966 (Exhibit 5.6[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_5_6]). That stability meant thatnet income as a percentage of assets and the degree of leverage were roughlyinversely proportional during that century.The rates of return enjoyed by financial intermediaries on assets and equity(despite the decline in leverage) moved modestly higher during the period from1966 to 1982, owing to a rapid expansion in noninterest income, for example,from fiduciary activities, service charges and fees, and securitizations. Then,as a consequence of a marked increase in the scope of bank powers, noninterestincome again rose significantly between 1982 and 2006, boosting net income tonearly 15 percent of equity. That increase reflected in part the emergence inApril 1987 of court-sanctioned and Federal Reserve‒regulated “section 20”investment banking affiliates of bank holding companies.29[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber123] The transfer of suchbusiness is clearly visible in the acceleration of gross income originating incommercial banking relative to that in investment banking starting in 2000.30[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber124]I tentatively conclude that the relative stability of average netincome-to-equity ratios dating back to the post‒Civil War years reflects anunderlying competitive market-determined rate of return on intermediation, aresult consistent with stable time preference and real long-term interest rates.In summary, the crisis of 2008 has left in its wake a significantly highercapital-to-assets ratio requirement, both economic and regulatory, that must bereached if intermediation is to be restored to the point where banks and otherfinancial institutions are confident they have a sufficiently secure capitalcushion to lend freely. An open question is whether, in line with history, arise in the ratio of capital to assets in banks will also nudge up the ratio ofnet income to assets in the process. This is obviously an implication of highercapital-to-asset ratios.Too Big to FailBeyond the need to increase capital requirements, we still face the necessity ofaddressing the problems of some financial firms being “too big to fail” (TBTF)or, more appropriately, “too interconnected to be liquidated quickly.” Theproductive employment of the nation’s savings is threatened when financial firmsat the edge of failure are supported with taxpayer funds (savings) anddesignated as systemically important institutions.I agree with Gary Stern, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank ofMinneapolis, who has long held that “creditors will continue to underprice therisk-taking of these financial institutions, overfund them, and fail to provideeffective market discipline. Facing prices that are too low, systemicallyimportant firms will take on too much risk.”31[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber125]After remaining in the backwaters of economic analysis for years, “too big tofail” has finally gained the prominence it deserves. Firms that are perceived astoo big to fail have arisen as major visible threats to economic growth. Itfinally became an urgent problem when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placedinto conservatorship on September 7, 2008. Before then, U.S. policy makers (withfingers crossed) could point to the fact that Fannie and Freddie, by statute,were not backed by the “full faith and credit of the U.S. government.” Marketparticipants, however, did not believe the denial, and they consistentlyafforded Fannie and Freddie a special credit subsidy. It ranged between 13 basispoints for short-term debt to 42 basis points for longer-term debentures, with aweighted average of about 40 basis points.32[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber126] On September 7, 2008,market participants were finally vindicated.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac need to be split up into smaller companies, none ofthem too big to fail, and then reconstituted as stand-alone securitizers.Alternatively, they could be phased out by gradually lowering the size of theloans they can guarantee and securitize.Seventeen systemically important U.S. banks have been designated by at least onemajor regulator as effectively too big to fail, rendering them guaranteed by thefederal government. As has occurred with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the markethas already accorded these TBTF institutions subsidized funding. This is evidentin the cost of funding of large banking institutions relative to competingsmaller institutions not favored with subsidized borrowings. IMF researchers ina recent working paper estimated “the overall funding cost advantage of globalSIFIs as approximately 60 basis points (bp) in 2007 and 80 bp in 2009.”33[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber127] The top forty-five U.S.banks in this study exhibited about the same degree of support as the globalaverage. In competitive financial markets, 40 to 80 bp is a very largeadvantage.Such a market-based subsidy will enable a bank or other financial intermediaryto attract part of the nation’s savings to fund its operations, even if itspolicies and portfolio, unsubsidized, would fail. Banks that become inefficientbecause they chronically fund inefficient firms should be allowed to fail. Theviability of our economic system requires it. Even more worrisome, the marketplayers are beginning to conjecture that in the event of the next crisis, mostof the American financial system effectively would be guaranteed by the U.S.government.As I noted earlier, sovereign credit should be employed as a backstop onlyduring periods of extreme financial breakdown. Sovereign credit is not withoutcost. It creates institutions that are too big to fail, a short step from cronycapitalism (see Chapter 11 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-16.xhtml]). Moreimportant, it becomes addictive, offering a seemingly politically cost-freeavenue to a solution for every conceivable adverse aberration in economicactivity.ADDRESSING THE DIFFICULTHow to deal with systemically important institutions is among the majorregulatory problems for which there are no easy solutions. Early resolution ofbank problems under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of1991 (FDICIA) appeared to have worked with smaller banks during periods ofgeneral prosperity. But the notion that risks can be identified in asufficiently timely manner to enable the liquidation of a large failing bankwith minimum loss proved untenable during a crisis in which many large bankswere at risk of failing at once. And as I noted in Chapter 2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-7.xhtml], I suspect solving the problem of largefailing banks by “prompt corrective action” will prove untenable in futurecrises as well.34 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber128]The solution, in my judgment, that has at least a reasonable chance of reversingthe extraordinarily large moral hazard that has arisen in the wake of the crisisis, as I noted, to require banks and possibly all financial intermediaries toissue CoCo bonds, as I mentioned earlier. Such debt will, of course, be morecostly on issuance than simple debentures.However, should contingent convertible bonds prove insufficient, we should allowlarge institutions to fail. If regulators determine that an institution is toointerconnected to liquidate quickly, that institution should be taken into aspecial bankruptcy facility when normal debtor-in-possession financing isavailable. When debtor-in-posession financing is not available, the regulatorshould be granted access to very limited taxpayer funds to facilitate thegradual liquidation of a failed institution. Its creditors (when equity iswholly wiped out) would be subject to statutorily defined principles ofdiscounts from par (“haircuts”), and the institution would then be required tosplit up into separate units, none of which should be of a size that is too bigto fail. The whole process could be administered by a panel of judges who areexpert in finance.I assume that some of the newly created firms would survive, while others willfail. If, after a fixed short period of time, no viable exit from the bankruptcyappears available, the financial intermediary should be liquidated asexpeditiously as feasible.An interesting speculation is whether the crisis that emerged in August 2007from the extraordinary leverage (as much as twenty-five to thirty times tangiblecapital)35 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber129] taken on byU.S. investment banks would have occurred had these firms remained thepartnerships that they were nearly four decades earlier. The 1970 New York StockExchange ruling that allowed broker-dealers to incorporate and gain permanentcapital seemed sensible at the time.36[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber130] Nonetheless, aspartnerships, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns almost surely would not havedeparted from their historically low leverage. Before incorporation, fearful ofthe joint and several liabilities to which general partnerships are subject,those entities shied away from virtually any risk they could avoid. Their coreunderwriting of new issues rarely exposed them for more than a few days.To be sure, the senior officers of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers losthundreds of millions of dollars from the collapse of their stocks. But none, tomy knowledge, has filed for personal bankruptcy.A Whiff of the PastThe prototype for any restoration of partnership finance in today’s environmentmay well be my very first employer as an economist (in 1947), Brown BrothersHarriman, the oldest and largest privately owned bank in the United States.Because of its partnership structure, it refrained from engaging in much of therisk-laden investment strategies of recent years, and emerged unscathed from thecrisis. Its credit ratings are high, its balance sheet highly liquid, and inrecent years it has reported no nonperforming loans. This, if my memory servesme, sounds a good deal like the balance sheets that investment banks generallyexhibited through most of their existence as partnerships.To be sure, since partnerships are limited in size, to do the nation’s businessthe economy would require a far larger set of financial institutions than existstoday. While replicating the incentive structure of partnerships should be agoal whenever feasible in future reform, that goal will doubtless be compromisedgiven that the corporate structure is seen as being required to raise capital ona scale perceived as necessary in today’s global market. To eliminate moralhazard, it should not be necessary to follow Hugh McCulloch, our firstcomptroller of the currency, in 1863, who went somewhat over the edge inproposing that the National Bank Act “be so amended that the failure of anational bank be declared prima facie fraudulent, and that the officers anddirectors, under whose administration such insolvency shall occur, be madepersonally liable for the debts of the bank, and be punished criminally, unlessit shall appear, upon investigation, that its affairs were honestlyadministered.” Under such a regime, moral hazard surely would not exist.Regulations Embodying a Forecast Fail with RegularityThe crisis has demonstrated that neither bank regulators nor anyone else canconsistently and accurately forecast whether, for example, subprime mortgageswill turn toxic or to what degree, or whether a particular tranche of acollateralized debt obligation will default, much less whether the financialsystem as a whole will seize up. A large fraction of such difficult forecastswill invariably be proved wrong. Regulators can sometimes identify heightenedprobabilities of underpriced risk and the existence of bubbles. But they almostcertainly cannot, except by chance, effectively time the onset of crisis.37[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber131] This should not come as asurprise.A financial crisis is almost always accompanied by an abrupt and sharp declinein the price of income-producing assets. That decline is usually induced by adramatic spike in the discount rate on expected income flows as marketparticipants swing from euphoria to fear. Implicit in any sharp price change isthat it is unanticipated by the mass of market participants, for were itotherwise, the price imbalances would have been arbitraged away.Indeed, for years leading up to the increase in foreclosure starts that began inthe summer of 2006, it was widely expected that the precipitating event of the“next” crisis would be a sharp fall in the dollar in response to the dramaticincrease in the U.S. current account deficit that began in 2002. The dollaraccordingly came under heavy selling pressure. The rise in the euro-dollarexchange rate from around 1.10 in the spring of 2003 to 1.30 at the end of 2004appears to have gradually arbitraged away the presumed dollar trigger of the“next” crisis. The U.S. current account deficit did not play a prominent directrole in the timing of the 2008 crisis, although because of that, it may in thenext.Many analysts argue that forecasting is not required for regulation. A systemicregulator, they hold, could effectively adjust capital and liquidityrequirements to match the stage of the business cycle. Properly calibrated, suchrequirements presumably could be effective in assuaging imbalances. But cyclesare not uniform, and it is difficult to judge at any point in time exactly wherewe are in the cycle. For example, the low of the unemployment rate at cyclicalpeaks (as identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research) since 1948 hasranged between 2.6 and 7.2 percent. Would policy makers have judged a turn inthe business cycle when, for example, the unemployment rate rose to 5.8 percentin April 1995, up from 5.4 percent in March of that year? In the event, theunemployment rate soon reversed itself and continued to fall for five moreyears.The Federal Reserve has been concerned for years about the ability of regulatorysupervisors and examiners to foresee emerging problems that have eluded internalbank auditing systems and independent auditors. I remarked in 2000 before theAmerican Bankers Association that “in recent years rapidly changing technologyhas begun to render obsolete much of the bank examination regime established inearlier decades. Bank regulators are perforce being pressed to dependincreasingly on greater and more sophisticated private market discipline, thestill most effective form of regulation. Indeed, these developments reinforcethe truth of a key lesson from our banking history—that private counterpartysupervision remains the first line of regulatory defense.”38[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber132] Regrettably, that firstline of defense also failed in 2008.A century ago, examiners could appraise individual loans and judge theirsoundness.39 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber133] But intoday’s global lending environment, how does a U.S. bank examiner judge thecredit quality of, say, a loan to a Russian bank, and hence of the loanportfolio of that bank? That, in turn, would require vetting the Russian bank’scounterparties and those counterparties’ counterparties, all to judge thesoundness of a single loan. In short, a bank examiner cannot make a judgment andneither can a credit-rating agency. How deep into the myriad layers ofexamination is enough for certification?The complexity of our financial system in operation spawns, in any given week,many alleged pending crises that, in the event, never happen, and innumerableallegations of financial misconduct. To examine each such possibility at thelevel of detail necessary to reach meaningful conclusions would require anexamination force many multiples larger than those now in place in any of ourbanking regulatory agencies. Arguably, at such levels of examination, sound banklending and its necessary risk taking would be impeded.The Federal Reserve and other regulators were, and are, therefore required toguess which of the assertions of pending problems or allegations of misconductshould be subject to full scrutiny by a regulatory workforce with necessarilylimited examination capacity. But this dilemma means that in the aftermath of anactual crisis, we will find highly competent examiners failing to have spotted aBernie Madoff. Federal Reserve supervision and evaluation is as good as it gets,even considering the failures of past years. Banks still have little choice butto rely upon counterparty surveillance as their first line of crisis defense.40[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber134]"},{"pageContent":"SIXSCHOONER INTELLIGENCE AND THEN SOMEFew Americans in the nineteenth century probably thought much about broadereconomywide developments, but those who did more likely than not embraced theconventional wisdom of Adam Smith and his followers: Markets were alwaysself-adjusting and bouts of unemployment were temporary. All economic forceswere inevitably pressing for full utilization of the nation’s resources. Ifsupply was excessive, prices would fall, and lower prices would galvanizesuppressed demand. To be sure, much attention was given to booms and busts, butbusiness discussions of the state of the economy overall were phrased ingeneral, qualitative terms: “Business is depressed” or “money is very tight.”Indeed, a century later researchers produced such “annals” going back to 1790.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber135] We did have some harddata: The decennial census of population, which increasingly included economicdata, gave analysts a general idea for census years of the size and makeup ofthe overall economy. But timely numbers for the American economy as a whole werescarce prior to the twentieth century.Government was seen by almost all as having little role in the economy, otherthan providing security against crime and war and fostering a rule of law withparticular emphasis on the protection of property rights. Prior to the CivilWar, revenues to sustain these functions came almost exclusively from customsfees and some sales of public lands. The introduction of income taxes had toawait the Sixteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which did not arriveuntil 1913.There were no official fiscal and monetary policies in today’s meaning of theterms. The government was not seen as having a role in directing macroeconomicdevelopments. There were, of course, isolated instances in which the U.S.Treasury, and especially the Second Bank of the United States, appeared to haveengaged in what we today term fiscal or monetary policy. But these actions werenot systematic, and they were a very pale comparison to today’s policy responseto every pending shortfall of economic performance from its perceived optimum.ECONOMIC FORECASTING AS PRIVATE ENTERPRISEThrough nearly the first century and a half of American history, such economicforecasting as occurred was chiefly a matter for private enterprise and prior tothe Civil War was largely related to agriculture and shipping. What businessmensought above all was information on the competitive forces that affected themdirectly. In recent decades, we have grown so accustomed to receiving news inreal time that we take it largely for granted. But timely information in thefirst half of the nineteenth century was precious and costly to acquire in a wayno one thinks about today. The thirst for information, especially from financialmarkets, was unquenchable in those early days of the republic. The flow ofimports into the populous U.S. East Coast during that century was much lesspredictable, altering supply and prices, often in unexpected directions. Toaddress that pressing issue, the Journal of Commerce,2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber136] a primary source ofbreaking shipping news, cleverly deployed two deepwater schooners to interceptincoming ships to get trade stories ahead of the markets. Schooner intelligencewas the information high technology of its day. The wasted effort created bylack of timely information was widespread. When, for example, prior to 1850,similar commodities were traded in separate markets, with participants in eachmarket unaware of what was concurrently happening in the others, theprice-making process was decidedly suboptimal.The major information breakthrough in the United States occurred when Samuel F.B. Morse demonstrated a commercially viable telegraph in 1844.3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber137] Within a decade, Morse’stelegraph blanketed much of the country east of the Mississippi River and,shortly thereafter, much of populated California. But that left a large void inthe center of the country. In the late 1850s, it still took more than threeweeks, by a combination of telegraph and stagecoach, to convey a message fromone coast to the other. Starting in 1860, the foreshortened route of thelegendary Pony Express brought the transmission time to under ten days.4[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber138] But the informationinnovation of the Pony Express came to an abrupt end on November 15, 1861, whenthe transcontinental telegraph was joined and business could communicate acrossthe continent in a matter of minutes.There can be little doubt that in the seventeen years between 1844 and 1861 thecontribution of information transfer to national productivity was enormous. Fromthe point of view of financial markets, however, the poor state of transatlanticcommunications still remained a problem. The front page of the New York Times ofSeptember 18, 1850, well before the laying of the transatlantic telegraph cable,was typical of that period. The Times announced that “the Royal Mail SteamerEuropa arrived at Boston yesterday [and] her mails of September 8th reached thiscity at an early hour last evening. . . . The news has considerable interest.”The U.S.-European information merger finally took place (after several falsestarts) on July 28, 1866, when the transatlantic cable went into operation. Onthat day, market participants in New York, San Francisco, and London couldcommunicate with one another nearly in real time. Those flows of informationgreatly facilitated more efficient pricing throughout these geographicallydiverse locations and undoubtedly improved the allocation of global resources.5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber139]As a consequence of these remarkable new technologies, financial informationdissemination finally turned national and global after the Civil War. The WallStreet Journal emerged in 1889, eventually becoming the icon of business newsand, of course, the creator of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.LOCATION MATTERSSignaling to participants in financial markets in real time profitable ways toinvest a society’s savings enhances productivity and standards of living. But ifenhanced information can add value to economic output, so too can reduced costsof transportation. Location matters. In the mid-twentieth century, steel sheetscoming off a rolling mill near Pittsburgh had less economic value than the samesteel entering an automotive assembly line in Detroit. Minimizing the resourcesnecessary to move goods to final users increases net value added.Railroad expansion and the Homestead Act,6[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber140] during and after theCivil War, opened up the Great Plains to a massive migration that led to themore than doubling of national wheat production. Steel production, the backboneof American industrial advance in the last quarter of the nineteenth century,was propelled forward by the invention of the Bessemer furnace (1856) and thediscovery in 1866 of iron ore in Minnesota’s Mesabi Range. By 1890, U.S. ironore production had quadrupled. Northern Michigan’s canal locks, at Sault Ste.Marie, which opened in 1855 and linked Lake Superior and Lake Huron, enabledMesabi ore to be shipped to the burgeoning steel industry of the Midwest, andchanneled a substantial part of national grain output through the Erie Canal andon to the populous East Coast.A century earlier, aside from coastal and river shipping, transportation waslargely horse driven. Horses in those days were a major part of our economy’scapital stock. They, along with oxen and mules, were the key to travel andtransport until they were displaced by the railroad and motor vehicles. Duringthe closing years of the nineteenth century, real-time economic information andefficient transportation expanded dramatically, materially reducing the costs ofproducing the nation’s output. The building of the transcontinental railroad(completed in 1869) reduced the travel time across the continent from six monthsto six days. And the emergence earlier of the telegraph was to communicationwhat the railroads became to the transportation of goods and people.In today’s world of global real-time communications and jet travel, we tend tolose sight of what was all too evident to our forebears: that the value ofproduction depends on timely location of goods and the speed at whichinformation on prices, interest rates, and exchange rates becomes available toproducers. These seminal relationships are covered further in Chapter 8[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-13.xhtml].THE BIRTH OF THE AGE OF DATABy the twentieth century, enough data existed to develop estimates of the sizeand changes in national economic output. Railcar loadings became a popular meansof judging production. (I still use those data to help track industrial activityon a weekly basis.) By the 1920s, economic analysts were soon citing weekly bankclearings (excluding data from heavily financial New York City) to gaugenonfinancial economic trends nationwide. Regular “bank letters” emerged as amajor source for interpretations of ongoing business activity, the forerunner oftoday’s vast commentary on economic trends. The National City Bank letter,originated by George Roberts in 1914, and the Chase National Bank letter,originated in 1920 under the direction of Benjamin Anderson, became prominent.The Economist, published in London, increasingly included articles on U.S.business. The Federal Reserve started producing measures of economic activity in1919. Successive improvements led to something close to current practice in1927.In the 1930s, Simon Kuznets, an economics professor at the University ofPennsylvania, filled the need for more comprehensive measures of nationaleconomic developments. Funded by the National Bureau of Economic Research(NBER), Kuznets assembled time series data on national income back to 1869,broken down by industry, final product, and use—a method significantly moredetailed than any previous study had produced. His work set the standard forgross national product (GNP) measurement that was later adopted by theDepartment of Commerce. Eventually ongoing estimates of national income and GNPbecame available. Efforts to measure the national economy got a major push fromthe desire to better understand the depth and nature of the contraction ofeconomic activity during the Great Depression, and then received another impetusfrom the need for planning during the Second World War.Until the efforts by Kuznets to develop the national accounts, mostmacroeconomic measurement was directed toward producing a coherent qualitativenarrative of the business cycle. That work is most closely associated withWesley Clair Mitchell, the first director of research of the NBER, which wasfounded in 1920. Later, Mitchell coauthored with Arthur Burns the 1946 tomeMeasuring Business Cycles, in which they identified a large number ofstatistical indicators of economic expansion and contraction that enabled themto identify the turning points of past business cycles. This was the culminationof Mitchell’s thirty-six-year examination of business cycles that dated back tohis highly acclaimed 1913 treatise on the subject.Arthur Burns, under whom I studied at Columbia University in 1950, was also oneof my predecessors as Federal Reserve chairman (1970 to 1978) and as chairman ofthe Council of Economic Advisers (1953 to 1956). We forged a close relationshipthat continued for nearly four decades. Coincidentally, in 1946, I took anundergraduate course in statistics from Geoffrey Moore, a colleague of Burns’sat the NBER. Moore in later years formalized the work of Burns and Mitchell intoa series of “Leading Business Cycle Indicators,” still published by theConference Board.7 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber141]Business cycle turning points, to this day, are “official” dates announced(often well after the fact) by a committee chosen by the NBER. Those turningpoints have been virtually universally accepted by both private and governmenteconomists.As late as 1947, 18 percent of the U.S. population still lived on farms. (Todaythe figure is 2 percent.) Economic forecasting was thus still heavily focused onthe outlook for crops and livestock; expected crop production was dependent onthe then-poorly forecastable weather, and livestock forecasts were dependent onthe price of feed grains. Farm output continued to loom large even as industrialproduction began to take an ever increasing share of GNP in the latter part ofthe nineteenth century as the United States gradually wrested global economichegemony from the United Kingdom. Day-to-day economics for a large part of thecountry, however, was still tied to crops, cattle, and weather that remaineddecidedly local.The massive addition of railroad mileage (which peaked in 1930) helped inexpanding the division of labor in the U.S. economy beyond its heavily localcharacter during most of the nineteenth century. The development of the motorvehicle industry provided yet another large impetus to industrial activity. Themotor vehicle, supported by a rapidly growing petroleum industry, carried usinto post‒World War II America. Of course, the value offered by ever fastertravel and transport must always be balanced against the monetary andnonmonetary costs of achieving those gains. Our short-lived dalliance withsupersonic aircraft demonstrated that what is technologically feasible is notalways economically or politically viable.POSTWAR YEARSThe huge statistical bureaucracy that was spawned during the New Deal, andespecially during World War II, morphed into innumerable government statisticalagencies after the war. Data collection systems by private researchorganizations such as the National Industrial Conference Board and the NationalBureau of Economic Research (both dominant in the 1920s) covering trends inAmerican business were gradually displaced by government statistical collectionthat previously had largely been restricted to data collected as part of thedecennial census. And the census, originally limited to the population estimatesrequired by the Constitution, gradually over the decades began to askeconomically related questions. The advent of the computer and later theInternet vastly expanded the detailed statistical chronicling of America.FIRST EXPERIENCESMy career in forecasting over the past six decades has roughly coincided withits increasing prominence in both the private and public spheres. I was one ofthe founding members of the National Association for Business Economics in 1959,and I became its president in 1970. I also became chairman of the Conference ofBusiness Economists in 1974 and was scheduled to be chairman of the EconomicClub of New York in 1987 had I not joined the Federal Reserve. While businesseconomists in those early years dabbled in macroforecasting, most of us weremuch more heavily focused on microforecasting—for firms and for industries.Macroforecasting remained largely in the hands of academia and the government.MACROFORECASTINGMy first experience with macroforecasting was more confusing than edifying. AsWorld War II was winding down, Keynesian macroforecasters predicted that withthe end of military spending, a “mature” America, as the eminent KeynesianHarvard economist Alvin Hansen put it, would slump back into the “secularstagnation” that prevailed in the prewar world of the Great Depression.8[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber142] Hansen’s thesis waswidely supported and I, as a college student, found his arguments persuasive. Myfirst tutorial in contrary opinion, however, arose when I read an equallyconvincing tome by a nonacademic microeconomic practitioner, George Terborgh ofthe Machinery and Allied Products Institute. His book The Bogey of EconomicMaturity was published just after the war. In the event, the U.S. economy boomedin the postwar period. The origins of that boom were probably more nuanced thanTerborgh had argued and less damning to Hansen’s view of the economy than mightappear on the surface. But the lesson that I drew was that when it came tomacroeconomic forecasts, intelligent people could make big mistakes.TO WORKMy first job out of college in 1948 was with the highly respected businessresearch organization known today as the Conference Board. I left the ConferenceBoard in 1953 and joined William W. Townsend, a veteran Wall Streeter forty-oneyears my senior, to form a small consulting firm, Townsend-Greenspan & Company.We had a wonderful relationship for five years until he passed away in 1958. Icarried on, little knowing what lay ahead. I was finally in the forecastingbusiness, though not yet as a macroforecaster. However, my forecastingexperience was widening at the industry level.I look back fondly to the 1950s and 1960s, when I specialized in individualindustry (micro) forecasting with a bit of finance thrown in. I immenselyenjoyed delving into how individual markets worked at a level of detail notfeasible in macromodels. In my early years, when steel was a specialty, I readall eight hundred pages of the industry bible, The Making, Shaping and Treatingof Steel. Years later, in 1997, when appearing before a meeting of the AmericanIron and Steel Institute, I asserted with no small amount of nostalgia that Iwas the only Federal Reserve chairman who had read that book from cover tocover. Nobody challenged my assertion.As the years rolled on, Townsend-Greenspan became quite diverse, employingmicromodels to help analyze a wide variety of markets—some global—in oil,natural gas, coal, pharmaceuticals, and motor vehicles, though not yet hightech, whose prominence was still in the future. We were increasingly successfulthrough the 1960s dispensing our brand of microeconomics, and we prospered.The broad scope of industries we eventually covered inevitably brought us closeto forecasting macrodevelopments. But using the same techniques we devised toevaluate individual industries did not always go well when expanded to theglobal stage. We had, for example, assumed that with global demand for petroleumproducts being demonstrably historically price inelastic (that is, unresponsiveto price change), the rapid escalation of oil prices that emerged from the OPECoil embargo of 1973‒74 could continue for years. But oil demand, to my surprise,fell off sharply as prices rose, indicating that the demand for oil was moreelastic with respect to price than I and many others had previously appreciated.The rate of oil consumption per dollar of real GDP unexpectedly turned downward,lessening pressures on inflation. I was well wide of the mark on that forecast.COMPETITORSOur forecasting competitors also made some massive errors from time to time. Inretrospect, some of our more important collective errors reflected an incompleteunderstanding of the growing complexity of finance. Even the economists forbanks and financial institutions did not distinguish themselves as greatforecasters of either the economy or financial markets. The two presumably moresophisticated computer-based macroeconomic forecasting firms—Data Resources Inc.(commonly known as DRI) and Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates (bothfounded in 1969)—had their share of forecast misses but nonetheless builtformidable successful and econometric-driven firms.DRI and Wharton Econometrics remained at the forefront of the macroeconomicforecasting business for decades. DRI was headed by Otto Eckstein, a notedHarvard professor and member of President Johnson’s Council of EconomicAdvisers. Wharton Econometrics’ roots were more academic than those of itscompetitor. Founded by Lawrence Klein9[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber143] of the Wharton School,the firm grew out of the school’s economics research unit. That unit hadreceived so much sponsorship from U.S. corporations in the preceding few yearsthat it needed a more defined structure to manage the burgeoning volume ofprojects coming through its doors. DRI grew until eventually merging withWharton Econometrics in 2001.10[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber144]As DRI and Wharton continued to grow, so did Townsend-Greenspan and ourmicroforecasting work.THE FORD YEARS11 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber145]I carried my statistical experiences with me as I took a leave of absence fromTownsend-Greenspan to become, in September 1974, chairman of President Gerald R.Ford’s Council of Economic Advisers. Shortly thereafter, the economy was introuble. New orders received by businesses for their products were declining,production began to fall rapidly, and unemployment started to increase indiscontinuous jumps. That the economy was heading into a recession (if it werenot in fact already in one) didn’t require much debate.As 1974 drew to a close, retail sales and home building were soft, and much ofwhat we consider final demand was slipping. By Christmas 1974, the key questionfor economic policy was whether we were experiencing an inventory recession,which meant a sharp but temporary erosion in production and employment asbusinesses worked off excess inventories, or a far more dangerous softening inthe economy brought about by a more persistent weakness in final demand. Thiswas the burning issue for President Ford. An answer had to be formulated asquickly as feasible because the types of economic policy initiatives that oneshould employ depended on the answer.For a short-term inventory recession, the optimum policy, as we saw it, was todo as little as politically possible and let the natural forces of the economybring the recession to a halt. If it looked as though the bottom were fallingout of final demand, much more drastic policy options would have to beconsidered. The problem was that I felt our existing economic intelligence wasinadequate to monitor the rapidly weakening economy.The political advice being offered to the administration was unequivocal. GeorgeMeany, the president of the AFL-CIO, was typical. “America is in the worsteconomic emergency since the Great Depression,” he testified in March 1975. “Thesituation is frightening now and it is growing more ominous by the day. This isnot just another recession, for it has no parallel in the five recessions in thepost‒World War II period. America is far beyond the point where the situationcan correct itself. Massive government action is needed.”The Council of Economic Advisers initially didn’t have even a monthly GNP seriesto guide policy, but starting in December 1974, we developed what amounted to aweekly GNP. It may not have passed the rigid statistical standards of the Bureauof Economic Analysis (BEA) of the Department of Commerce, but it was more thanadequate—in fact quite instrumental—in answering the question of whether we hadan inventory recession, a final demand recession, or both.While the Department of Commerce has since abandoned its weekly retail salesseries, it nonetheless did yeomanlike service during that period in indicatingthat personal consumption expenditures were not undergoing a downward plunge.The other sectors of the economy had to be estimated more indirectly. Industrytrade sources, coupled with the latest data on building permits and housingstarts, outlined the residential sector for us on a weekly basis. Surveyforecasts of plant and equipment, monthly new orders and shipments formachinery, data on nonresidential construction, and, with a delay, imports ofcapital equipment were a crude proxy for capital investment. From theunemployment insurance system we were able to get a rough indicator of aggregatehours worked, which, combined with an estimate of output per work hour (whichwere little more than educated guesses), yielded a rough estimate of total realGNP, which was then reconciled with its component parts.Putting all of these statistics together indicated, with some degree ofrobustness, something that we knew for a fact only much later: that the rate ofinventory liquidation—the gap between GNP and final demand—was exceptionallylarge by historic standards. That gap reflected the fact that production hadbeen cut well below the level of final demand in order to work off the excessinventories that had accumulated. Therefore, if final demand continued tostabilize, as apparently it was doing in the early weeks of 1975, therecession’s low point was close at hand and a marked rebound from the downturnwas highly likely. Inventory liquidation cannot go on indefinitely. It musteventually slow, and that process closes the gap between final demand andproduction. It soon became clear from the weekly insured unemployment data andseveral qualitative indicators that the worst was over.At that point we could conclude that further expansionary measures would beunnecessary and in the long run could turn out to be counterproductive.12[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber146] Short-term emergency GNPmonitoring was no longer necessary, and the short history of the weekly GNP cameto a very creditable end.13[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber147]POLITICSLooking back on that period, President Ford exhibited unusual political couragein 1975 by acquiescing in only a very small stimulus when “conventional wisdom”at the time was for a policy response that was far more aggressive. Fordnonetheless persevered. In much the same way, so did Ronald Reagan by hisunwavering support of Paul Volcker and the Federal Reserve’s tight money policyof 1980‒82, when political opposition to the Fed’s efforts was most intense.In any democratic society, it is very difficult for presidents, congressmen,central bankers, or any other economic policy makers to move ahead ofconventional wisdom, which is often reinforced by the pressures of herdbehavior. To lead markets requires a conviction that is rare among publicofficials because running ahead of markets, of necessity, implies holding a viewcontrary to the participants in markets themselves, who invest real money. Andin my experience, if policy makers are in a minority and wrong, they arepolitically pilloried. If they are in a majority, and wrong, they are toleratedand the political consequences are far less dire. Presidents Ford and Reaganwere more politically courageous than I had realized at the time.When in public office myself, I became acutely aware of the pull of politicalbias. Politicians are driven to take a stance that (1) the outlook isunequivocally good (the result of their policies) and no change in policy stanceis required (an upbeat assumption that is always acceptable, even if provedwrong), or that (2) things are not good and nothing short of maximum response isacceptable, for if events do in fact turn dire, half measures appear as(politically) ineffectual as no action at all.Most nonelected public policy makers, in my experience, are able to fight thispolitical bias but probably never fully successfully. I tried to insulate myselfwhen I became chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in 1974. I toldFord’s chief of staff, Donald Rumsfeld, that I could not continue the practiceof the CEA chairman’s being the administration’s chief economic spokesman,because I was certain that I would differ with, and hence could not support,some of the president’s economic initiatives—the WIN (Whip Inflation Now)buttons, for example. As I requested, the task was given back to the secretaryof the treasury. But much to my surprise and delight, there were very feweconomic initiatives pursued by President Ford with which I strongly differed.BACK TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISEFord’s term as president ended at noon on January 20, 1977, and I was on thenoon shuttle to New York that day and by 2 p.m. was back in my old office atTownsend-Greenspan overlooking New York Bay. I immediately fell into mypregovernment routine of following and forecasting the American—and later theworld—economy. In fact, my daily activities were not that much different fromwhat I had pursued in Washington for two and a half years. The sole innovationwas that I was devoting time to construct a macroeconometric model and created acomputer-based forecasting system for the first time. While Townsend-Greenspanremained active in industry-based microforecasting, my efforts to develop amacroeconometric model grew out of my growing interest in understanding theworkings of the economy as a whole and the complementary benefits that wouldflow to our industry-based work.I joined the boards of Mobil, JPMorgan, Alcoa, General Foods, CapitalCities-ABC, and ADP. Most were, or became, clients of Townsend-Greenspan. AfterPresident Reagan was elected, I was appointed a member of his ForeignIntelligence Advisory Board, much of the time advising on the accuracy offoreign statistics, especially those of the Soviet Union. In addition, duringthe Reagan administration years I served on numerous presidential commissions,most important, the Social Security Reform Commission (1983).AT THE FEDI joined the Federal Reserve in August 1987, two months before the bottom fellout of the stock market. The stock market decline of more than one fifth onOctober 19, 1987, created a massive contraction in market wealth. Accordingly,the Fed opened up the money spigots to full throttle. I was deeply puzzled asthe weeks went on by the small effect the capital losses had on economicactivity. It was not until I experienced the demise of the dot-com and housingbubbles that I finally concluded that the reason for the economy’sunresponsiveness to the shock of October 19, 1987, was that the stock marketinvestors who absorbed the huge losses at that time were wholly unleveraged.14[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber148]On becoming chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, I soon realized that it hadas an integral part of its organization something like 250 of the most skilledPhDs in economics, certainly in the United States and very probably in theworld. That group was led through my eighteen-year tenure by Mike Prell andDavid Stockton as the heads of the Division of Research and Statistics, and TedTruman and Karen Johnson as heads of the board’s International Division. Therewasn’t a question I could imagine to which I couldn’t find some expert torespond somewhere in the organization. Domestic forecasting was directly orindirectly processed through the Federal Reserve’s macroeconomic model of theU.S. economy, though there was extensive tweaking of the model’s output tocapture economic forces not captured by the model.Despite the fact that the model missed the collapse of 2008 along with virtuallyall other models, its historical record has been better than most.While decisions of the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)are not legally subject to alteration by any other agency of government, it hasalways been clear that lurking in the background is the possibility that aCongress and/or a president, irate at monetary policy, could, throughlegislation, alter the Fed’s degree of independence, thereby crippling itseffectiveness. In my eighteen and a half years as Fed chairman, I received afigurative truckload of requests from Congress urging an easier monetary policy.I don’t recall ever receiving a single request urging the Fed to tighten.15[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber149]The Fed grew concerned in August 1991 when Senator Paul Sarbanes introduced abill to restrict FOMC votes to governors only. This would be an irreversiblestep toward chronically easier monetary policy because, in my experience, theevidence does support the view that presidents of the Federal Reserve banks havebeen more “hawkish” than the presidentially appointed (and Senate confirmed)governors. The bill did not muster the support needed to become law. With theeconomy expanding, at times briskly, threats to the Fed’s independence frommid-1991 to 2008 were minimal.But, as I noted in the Introduction, the Fed came under increasing pressure forgreater congressional oversight when, in response to the financial breakdown of2008, it invoked the rarely used provision of the Federal Reserve Act thatenables it to lend virtually without limit to virtually anyone, in the UnitedStates or abroad. The Fed lent $29 billion to JPMorgan to facilitate the bailoutof Bear Stearns in March 2008. I viewed it as the Fed’s acting in itslong-honored role as fiscal agent of the U.S. Treasury, and would have preferredthe U.S. Treasury to immediately swap Treasury securities with the Fed for itsclaims against JPMorgan.When I raised the issue of the Treasury’s quickly taking over the central bank’scommitments, I was told by a senior Treasury official that that would haverequired the administration to request appropriated funds from the Congress(true)—a political nonstarter. That was a most regrettable failure, especiallybecause it was not a matter of substance but a quirk in fiscal bookkeeping.Whether claims are held as an asset of the central bank or by a subsidiary ofthe U.S. Treasury makes no difference to markets or taxpayers. The liabilitiesof the Treasury and the Federal Reserve are both interchangeable sovereignliabilities of the U.S. government.In the aftermath of the financial crisis, much of the Federal Reserve’sindependence appeared for a time to be at risk of being severely weakened. Inthe event, however, the response of the Congress with respect to the FederalReserve has been fairly muted to date. The basic structure and functioning ofthe system has remained intact, including the voting power of the bankpresidents."},{"pageContent":"SEVENUNCERTAINTY UNDERMINES INVESTMENTThe first recovery out of recession I ever tracked, as a neophyte economist, wasin 1949. I had recently joined the National Industrial Conference Board andevery researcher in the shop was focused on an economic phenomenon no one hadexperienced for years. The American economy had, of course, faltered in 1945 asmilitary spending fell sharply. But output of consumer goods surged from late1945 through 1946 in a drive to fill inventories of such goods after years ofshortages and rationing. The associated acceleration in inventory accumulationcould not be sustained and production decelerated in late 1948 and 1949. Theinventory recession, however, was short-lived. Marriages had hit a high of 2.3million in 1946, sparking the beginning of the baby-boom generation a yearlater. Newly formed households extended the wartime boom in home ownership. In1950, single-family housing starts rose to a then-unprecedented level of 1.2million units. The sharp resurgence in building construction in general was amajor force for recovery. Although I couldn’t know it at the time, that cyclicalpattern of construction was to dominate the American business cycle for morethan a half century thereafter.In fact, private construction has been a major contributor to every recovery outof recession since 1949—except that of 2009. Both nonresidential and,especially, residential construction had important roles in the previous tenrecoveries of postwar America. But construction as a share of GDP, after fallingsharply in the wake of the economic collapse of 2008, has failed to fullyrecover since the recession officially ended in the second quarter of 2009(Exhibit 7.1 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_7_1]).1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber150] A deep-seated reluctanceof business and households to invest in projects with a life expectancy, ordurability, of more than twenty years (predominantly buildings) explainsvirtually all of the weakness in business activity and rise in the unemploymentrate following the Lehman Brothers default in September 2008 (see Box 7.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-12.xhtml#box_7_1]).BOX 7.1: THE MATURITY OF GDPTo measure the degree of aversion to investing in long-lived assets, Iconstructed a series of the average maturity or durability of personalconsumption expenditures and private fixed investment (combined, they composealmost nine tenths of total GDP). Software, according to the Bureau of EconomicAnalysis, lasts 3.5 years, nonresidential structures 38 years, and homesapproximately 75 years. Where there are no official estimates, I fill in themissing numbers—mainly for short-lived services—haircuts one month, for example.Not unexpectedly, the resulting series parallels the share of construction inGDP closely. Other than construction, most components of GDP have recovered moreor less as would have been expected in a “normal” recovery.The business community’s willingness to invest in fixed assets, as I noted inChapter 4 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-9.xhtml], is best captured by theproportion of liquid cash flow that nonfinancial corporate businesses choose tocommit to difficult-to-liquidate equipment and structures—the “cap-ex ratio.”2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber151] It is a useful measure ofthe degree of business confidence about the future. It doesn’t rely on whatpeople say but on what they do. In 2009, that ratio had fallen to the lowestpeacetime annual level since 1938 (Exhibit 7.2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_7_2]).3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber152] More economicallyrelevant is what market-driven forces “explain” the cap-ex ratio. As can be seenfrom Exhibit 7.3 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_7_3], theoperating rate of nonfarm business is, not surprisingly, an importantexplanatory variable of the measured variance. Less obvious is the verysignificant impact of the federal deficit, adjusted for business cyclevariation, on capital investment. This displacement (crowding out) by federaldeficits is covered more generally in Chapter 9[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-14.xhtml]. Similarly, the cyclically adjustedinterest rate spread between the U.S. Treasury’s thirty-year and five-yearobligations, currently the widest in history, reflects the degree of heighteneduncertainty beyond five years and explains why long-lived assets have been soheavily discounted and scaled back in recent years.Individuals displayed the same aversion to investing in long-term assets. Theirdisengagement was reflected in the sharp fall in the value of their purchases ofilliquid homes4 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber153] as aratio of household gross savings5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber154] (the equivalent ofbusiness cash flow). In 2010, that ratio fell to a quarter-century low (andbarely above the postwar low), reflecting the diversion of gross savings fromhousehold illiquid fixed investments to the paying down of mortgage and consumerdebt and the accumulation of liquid assets. Fearful of their future finances,households curtailed committing a large part of their gross savings to an assetwhich might be difficult to sell, except at a loss. Signs of a recovery havebeen mounting as the overhang of vacant homes has been drawn down. Homes priceshave recovered a third of their losses. But homeownership as share of totaloccupied dwelling units through the second quarter of 2013 failed to show signsof recovery.In short, the sharp increase in the aversion to long-term asset investment riskhad induced an equivalent withdrawal from long-term commitments by bothhouseholds and businesses. As the global economy imploded, both groups turned ona dime and retrenched, abruptly switching from long-lived to short-term assetinvestment with an emphasis on cash accumulation and debt repayment.In the boom years that preceded the crash of 2008, business executives weredrawn to the higher, though riskier, rates of return on long-term investments,and households (prior to 2006) to the prospect of capital gains throughhomeownership.6 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber155], 7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber156] Price bids above thelatest public offered price on a home were common, as anxious buyers, goaded byherd instinct, wanted to make sure they obtained the home of their choice.Homeownership rose by more than 1.3 million units annually between 2001 and2004,8 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber157] becoming theprincipal driver of the boom.Cash flow and capital gains are the dominant factors in determining overallbusiness capital investment. The use of cash flow is not costless, because itcan be employed either to fund capital investment, to build up cash balances, orto pay down debt. The cap-ex ratio is thus significantly affected by businessconfidence overall, in addition to the intrinsic value of individual projects.It is high in periods of prosperity (indeed it is a major cause), and low asbusiness slumps. The cap-ex ratio in peacetime has not exceeded 1.29 (excluding1974) or fallen below 0.67 since 1938 (Exhibit 7.2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_7_2]). These data suggest that thedegree of leveraging and deleveraging of investment is relatively tightlyconstrained, an issue I addressed in Chapter 4[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-9.xhtml].COST SAVING OUT FRONTThe significant rise in nonfinancial corporate domestic profitability from thespring of 2009 through the end of 2010 appears to have resulted almost whollyfrom gains in output per hour, most likely resulting from investments incost-saving facilities.9 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber158]Throughout the prolonged expansion in economic activity between 1983 and 2006,10[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber159] capital investment waspredominantly for risky, high leverage capacity expansion, and was expected toyield quite high rates of return—and it did. Cost-saving investments duringthose years, though moderately profitable, were markedly less risk laden thancapacity-expanding outlays. In discussing the issue with business executivesduring those years of euphoria, I sensed that many were reluctant to engage incost-saving investments in part because they viewed such investments asdiverting cash flow from more profitable capacity-expanding investments.Furthermore, cost-saving investments that entailed discharging people, anunsavory activity, are largely avoided in times of boom and euphoria.Following the crash of 2008, capacity-expanding capital investments declinedsharply. But the backlog of potential cost-saving investments, forgone duringthe protracted economic expansion, offered significant opportunities forinvestment. Reluctance to shed workers vanished. The payoff was a major increasein profit margins and profits through the fourth quarter of 2010. (See Box 7.2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-12.xhtml#box_7_2].)BOX 7.2: COST-SAVING INVESTMENTS ARE LESS RISKYIn contrast to an illiquid investment made to foster expansion, a cost-savingreplacement of an existing facility is almost always a safer, more predictablewager, and thus requires a much lower rate of return to be authorized. Thereason is that the potential increase in demand from a new market, a source ofconsiderable uncertainty, does not enter the replacement facility calculation asit does for capacity-expanding investments. For cost-saving investments,analysts can take the level of future expected demand as a given, and evaluateonly the alternatives to the existing facilities for achieving that output. Thevariance of returns to cost-saving investments therefore tends to beconsiderably less than the variance of returns to riskier expansion projects.Acceptable rates of return on cost-saving projects thus tend to be far lowerthan those required to green-light an expansion.FULL RECOVERY THWARTEDInvestment in longer-lived assets (structures) was shunned. They are far moresensitive to uncertainty than investment in shorter-lived assets (equipment andsoftware).11 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber160] Thus, thegreater the life expectancy of the investment, the higher the rate of returnrequired to justify the outlay. That propensity has never been more pronounced,in my experience, than in the period of stunted recovery in the immediateaftermath of the crisis of 2008.I have found the yield spread between the U.S. Treasury’s thirty-year bond andfive-year note to be the most useful measure of uncertainty beyond five years,and hence beyond most effects of the business cycle. It captures the degree ofuncertainty associated with expectations of inflation, taxation, climate change,future technologies, and the innumerable only partially identified events thatcould alter investment plans over the very long run.12[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber161]The shunning of homeownership, long-term commercial lease rental commitments,and new factories resulted in the dramatic greater than 40 percent decline innew construction, in real terms, from its cyclical peak reached in 2006 to itstrough in the first quarter of 2011. Home price increases over the past year areencouraging signs that the depressing overhang of vacant single-family homes islargely behind us. Nonetheless, single-family housing starts in June 2013 werestill only a third of their 2006 peak.THE WEDGEThe collapse in construction during the years 2008 to 2011 opened up a widechasm in growth rates between total real GDP and real GDP, excluding privatestructures. The share of private fixed investment going to structures declinedby more than a third from 1955 to 2011. The huge shortfall in real GDP caused bythis decline (Exhibit 7.6 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_7_6])accounted for the equivalent of a more than 2-percentage-point rise in theunemployment rate13 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber162] bythe first quarter of 2011.14[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber163] It has since receded inpart. The implied gap represented by the ratio of employment to the civiliannoninstitutional population is far more worrisome.The effect has been to create a two-tier economy: one comprising more than 90percent of the economy, producing goods and services with a duration of lessthan twenty years, and since 2009 operating at a modestly respectable rate ofpotential; and another comprising the remainder of economic activity—thatencompassing components with a duration of more than twenty years (almost allconstruction)—operating at barely more than half of potential. The distortion,as I noted earlier, resulted in sharply lower expected profit returns onbusiness structures and imputed returns on homeownership (mostly expected homeprice inflation) because they were discounted at the ever increasing ratesassociated with longer-lived assets. Those elevated discount rates sharplysuppressed the level of such investment. A significant part of real GDP, ineffect, has been put on the shelf and removed from prospective output. The CBO’sreal output gap, a measure of economic slack, is 6 percent (Exhibit 7.7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_7_7]). The shortfall in effectivedemand is also suppressing credit demand (see Chapter 12[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-17.xhtml]). Presumably, so long as the currentdegree of uncertainty persists, the disproportionate loss of long-lived assetinvestment is likely to frustrate full recovery.15[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber164]AVERSION TO INVESTMENTThat business had become markedly averse to investment in fixed long-term assetsappears indisputable. The critical question is why? Although most in thebusiness community attribute the massive rise in their fear and uncertainty tothe collapse of economic activity,16[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber165] many judge itscontinuance since the recovery took hold in early 2009 largely to be the resultof widespread government activism in its all-embracing attempt to accelerate thepath of economic recovery and regulate finance. The evidence tends to largelysupport the latter judgments.POLICY DISAGREEMENTSIn these extraordinarily turbulent times, it is not surprising that importantdisagreements among policy makers and economists have emerged on the issue ofthe size of government and the extent of policy activism. Almost all agree thatactivist government policy was necessary in the immediate aftermath of theLehman bankruptcy, when many critical overnight markets ceased to function,arguably a once-in-a-century event. This necessitated special policy treatmentbecause it was a unique market breakdown that did not occur in pre-2008financial crises where prices crashed but market structures remained intact.17[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber166] The tendency for marketprices to seek equilibrium cannot occur if market structure is dysfunctional.The powerful forces of free market adjustments fail. Under such circumstances,the substitution of sovereign credit for private credit is essential to quicklyrestore market structure. The U.S. Treasury’s equity support of banks throughthe Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the Federal Reserve’s support ofthe commercial paper market and money market mutual funds, for example, werecritical in arresting the free fall. All financial markets, however, werefunctioning again by early 2009.But the government activism as represented by the massive 2009 $831 billionfederal program of fiscal stimulus18[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber167] (the American Recoveryand Reinvestment Act, or ARRA),19[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber168] in addition to housingand motor vehicle subsidies, and innumerable regulatory interventions, continuesto be the subject of wide debate. The evidence of this once-in-a-lifetime eventis such that policy makers and economists can harbor different, seeminglyreasonable expositions of the forces that govern modern economies. At root thesedifferences reach down to the fundamentals of how economies—free market based orotherwise—operate. If common agreement on how capitalist markets functionexisted, I presume the differences among economic policy makers would have longsince been resolved. Regrettably, that is not the case.THE DEEP DIVIDEMost difficult to bridge are the differences among forecasters, or economistsmore generally, with respect to the broad conceptual framework of models of howall the elements of a market economy interact and how the economic world works.But many, if not most, of the key interrelationships are not directlyobservable—such as in a simple case of the shape of supply and demand curvesthat create prices and interest rates. We never observe the internal marketprocess directly because it exists only as abstract mathematical constructs ofeconomists. Perhaps the most important divergence between “liberal” and“conservative” economic policy makers is the extent to which each viewmarket-driven economies as competitive, flexible, and hence self-correcting.Programmed government expenditures and taxes (fiscal policy) or central bankinterest rates (monetary policy) exhibit unobservable channels of causationthrough which these policies affect economic outcomes. In short, all forecastsof economic developments ultimately rest on how each analyst fits the ex postfacts he or she observes in the marketplace into an all-encompassing,unobservable ex ante construct of the way an economy works toward its observableex post data.20 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber169]A rare partial insight into how financial markets under extreme stress workbehind the scenes became accessible as the 2008 financial crisis unfolded. Ahalf century ago, economists had envisioned a risk distribution of marketoutcomes represented by a bell curve (that is, a normal distribution) whoseoutcomes were determined wholly by chance, such as coin tossing. Later in thepostwar years, it became apparent that there were more fat-tail events—that is,extreme outcomes previously perceived as low probability—than would be expectedfrom a normal distribution of expected outcomes. On the morning of October 19,1987, for example, prior to the opening of the New York Stock Exchange, theprobability of a more than 20 percent decline in stock prices that day,eclipsing any previous one-day collapse, was at least ten thousand to one, andmore likely a million to one. It happened. And during the lead up to the crisisof 2008, many events occurred that could not easily be explained by any stretchof conventional wisdom.Economists, chastened by many such back-to-back highly improbable economicoutcomes, tilted toward assuming more fat-tail distributions. But as the years2007 to 2009 traced out the outcomes of the crisis, we came to understand thatthe “extreme” tails of probability outcomes such as 2008 were downrightobese—“highly improbable” catastrophic market breakdowns had begun to happen toooften. Examination of the data has altered previous views of the way financialrisk operates—mine in particular.It is dismaying when the real world runs counter to a cherished paradigm or, inthe words of Thomas Huxley, the famous nineteenth-century biologist, commits“the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact.”21[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber170] Physical scientists gothrough the same routine as economists and other social scientists, but theworld with which they deal is far more stable and predictable than the economicworld.22 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber171] The vagaries ofhuman nature do not affect the physical world. The laws of physics, for example,once identified, rarely have to be revised. Yet there are still famousdifferences among physicists. Albert Einstein never felt comfortable with theprobabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. As he famously said, “God doesn’tplay dice with the universe.” He sought certainty in the world, not probability.ENTER POLITICSAs I’ve noted, at the very center of the postcrisis political confrontations isthe debate over whether free markets are ultimately self-correcting, or as alarge number, perhaps a majority, of economists and policy makers currentlybelieve, the shortfalls of faulty human nature‒driven markets requiresignificant regulatory direction, periodic fiscal stimulus, and a vast safetynet for those who fall through the cracks of a largely self-regulated marketsystem.Stock prices were largely left free to seek their own level as the 2008 crisisunfolded.* [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-6_fn1.xhtml#footnote-1443-3] To be sure,the Federal Reserve’s more than doubling of its balance sheet in the fall of2008 (QE1) appears to have lowered real long-term interest rates that, otherthings equal, would tend to lower the earnings yield and raise the price ofcommon stocks. However, given the already nearly unprecedented heights ofeconomic angst following the Lehman default, no further explanation of thisclassic selling climax and subsequent price rebound seems necessary.Nonetheless, having observed the impact during the years 2000 to 2005 of fallinglong-term interest rates on the subsequent global asset price boom (see Chapter3 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-8.xhtml]), there is always doubt in such matters.The month-long stock selling climax that ended on March 9, 2009, absorbed themarket disequilibria and defined the price bottom.23[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber172] Unencumbered, the pricelevel has since doubled and recouped all of its losses from its historic peak ofOctober 2007. The extent to which markets, if allowed to adjust, willself-correct is at the core of the political debate. Free market imbalances areaddressed either by allowing markets to correct themselves through a sellingclimax or through government intervention that delays the adjustment and, frommy perspective, makes the ultimate adjustment even more problematic. In myexperience, extensively regulated markets and those rife with crony capitalismhave eviscerated, or at a minimum, significantly impaired, the automaticstabilizers of the market process.SELLING CLIMAX LIMITSGovernment policies that endeavor to prevent market liquidation are based on theimplicit premise that market declines not countered by intervention would feedon themselves virtually without limit. That would be true if fear could riseindefinitely in a self-reinforcing cycle. But it does not. Accordingly, marketsdo not fall indefinitely, as the stock market selling climax of March 2009 andthe experience of the Resolution Trust Corporation two decades earlierdemonstrate. At the height of a fear-driven selling climax, asset pricesinvariably fall to levels consistent with a level of extreme fear that ourpsyches rebel against and to which they eventually adjust. As I note in Chapter4 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-9.xhtml], fear inevitably lessens and stock pricesrebound. Were it otherwise, markets would not recover as rapidly as they do from“oversold” bear market lows.Today, the political pressure on government officials to respond to everyperceived shortcoming in economic performance has become overwhelming. Iobserved it build over my more than two-decade stretch in public office. Even ifpolicy makers acknowledge that allowing market declines to exhaust themselvesmay indeed return markets to balance, there always exists some uncertainty ofhow long an unimpeded market decline will persist or how deep it will go.24[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber173] Accordingly, in recentyears policy always has seemed biased toward activism when, more often than not,allowing markets to rebalance and heal is the most prudent policy.It has been my regrettable experience that the political response to policymakers’ actions heavily biases the policy makers toward catering to short-termbenefits, largely disregarding long-term costs. As I note in Chapter 6[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-11.xhtml], policy makers who intervene to supportmarket prices but do not succeed are nonetheless praised for trying. But thepolicy maker who allows markets to liquidate and prices to fall is less fondlytreated, even if, as Paul Volcker, my predecessor as chairman of the FederalReserve Board, experienced in 1981, he is vindicated in the end. And as I alsonote in Chapter 6 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-11.xhtml], President Gerald Ford,who took a principled stand against more-than-token intervention to counter thesharp recession of 1975, was accused by AFL-CIO head George Meany, just as theAmerican economy was finally stabilizing, of reckless policies. So was theResolution Trust Corporation when it allowed the real estate properties ofdefaulted savings and loans (S&Ls) to be sold at auction in 1989 at “bargain”prices far below their price at mortgage origination. While that act wasinstrumental in saving American taxpayers tens of billions of dollars, it wasquickly forgotten.25 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber174]THE CONSEQUENCESPreventing overbought markets (bubbles) from liquidating will create an overhangof market offers of undesired inventories in both product and financial marketsthat frustrates a normal rebound out of recession, or worse. Until, for example,the 2006 glut of single-family vacant homes for sale began to shrinksubstantially, U.S. home prices had difficulty recovering from their suppressedlevels. It is hard to visualize a housing recovery in which higher home pricesdo not play a, if not the, key role. I suspect that had the government stood byand allowed foreclosures to proceed without mediation, the housing crisis morethan likely would have been deeper but far shorter. I have always thought thatgiving cash assistance or a voucher to financially troubled homeowners is a farmore efficient policy than distorting the foreclosure process. It is revealingthat more than 60 percent of mortgages modified in the third quarter of 2008re-defaulted within a year of modification. Despite the rise in prices, however,the re-default rate, after declining, has apparently remained above 20 percent(Exhibit 7.8 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_7_8]).But while bailouts of financial institutions and even intervention into mortgagemarkets could, with a stretch, be nonprecedential, the bailout of General Motorsand Chrysler was clearly new ground.26[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber175] There are now no areas ofthe economy that are beyond the responsibility of the federal government. HadGeneral Motors and Chrysler been forced into bankruptcy court, union contractswould almost surely have been revised, and the companies financiallyrestructured and doubtless scaled down. The number of dealerships would havebeen reduced, and I have no doubt that non-American car brands would have gainedmarket shares. That would have meant a larger share of foreign nameplatevehicles assembled in nonunionized American plants. But aggregate purchases byAmerican buyers probably would have changed only marginally, if at all, anddomestic automakers’ balance sheets would have emerged unencumbered by toxicdebt.There is, regrettably, an understandable considerable difficulty in allowingicons that have historically been the symbols of America’s rise to globaleconomic hegemony to fall by the wayside. We cannot emotionally easilycountenance the demise of so symbolic an American icon any more than we wouldcontemplate the obsolescent grandeur of the U.S. Capitol being replaced with amodern building. But American Woolen and Kodak, icons in their day, scaled backwithout economic disruption. Of the original names that made up the Dow JonesIndustrial Average more than a century ago, only General Electric is still onthe list.As I discussed in Chapter 5 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-10.xhtml], because firmsdesignated as “systemically important” are accorded an implicit governmentguarantee of their liabilities, investors perceive those firms as near risklessand grant them interest rate subsidies. That accords them a competitiveadvantage not achieved through enhanced productivity. Savings are being directedto the politically powerful, not the economically efficient. Future productivitygains and standards of living are being put at risk.HISTORYBetween the end of the Civil War and World War I, America was plagued withfinancial crises that at the time seemed everlasting. To this day there is adispute as to whether the waves of crisis were fostered by the inelasticcurrency that arose from provisions of the National Bank Act of 1863. But in allcases, we liquidated the toxic assets and returned to full employment, oftenquickly.27 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber176] These crisesare the regrettable result of our natural propensity to swing between euphoriaand fear. And short of going to a rigid collectivized (and stagnant) economy, wehave never been able to keep animal spirits from swinging between extremes.I do not doubt that in the post-2008 climate of severe uncertainty, demand forlonger-lived assets—homes—was always doomed to be depressed. But if policyactivism had not been so unremitting, I strongly suspect that the pall ofuncertainty would have lifted sooner and the severe discounting of long-terminvestments would have been far less—and it would have long since been over.The major political problem in allowing markets to liquidate is that this wasprecisely the remedy for recessions supported by Andrew W. Mellon, PresidentHerbert Hoover’s long-serving secretary of the Treasury. Because he is soassociated with the boom and bust of the 1920s, such advice is promptlyrejected.POLICY ACTIVISMPolicy activism is the propensity of government, by fiscal, monetary, orregulatory policies, to alter the path of market outcomes from what wouldotherwise emerge from the unrestrained interplay of competition. To those policymakers who extol competition, activism threatens to widen the variance ofexpected outcomes of the projections of rate of return on prospective newprivate investments for both business and households. But perhaps just asinhibiting is the threat of arbitrary intervention perpetually overhanging amarket.To those policy makers who view competitive markets less benignly, governmentsmust be on alert to address “market failures.” The massive stimulus programinitiated in early 2009 (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act), thebailout of General Motors and Chrysler, the extensive and largely futile effortto prevent the home mortgage foreclosure process from running its course, andthe vast and troubled financial regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act areprime examples. The Dodd-Frank Act restructures the financial system presumablybased on how legislators believe markets should work. And indeed it largelyprovides goals of regulation to be implemented. But in the three years since theact was signed into law in 2010, it has become apparent that its remedies to theundisputed overreach of financial institutions have been based on an uninformedview of the role of finance and how it actually works. What is most disturbingabout the current period is that it echoes the policy disputes of the 1930s.NEW DEAL ACTIVISMWhile the degree of activism brought on by the New Deal was far more intensethan any of the interventions of the last five years, there are distinctparallels in initiatives to jump-start the private economy. The GreatDepression’s National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) viewed excessivecompetition as the cause of falling prices, and the Roosevelt administration dideverything it could think of in response, from raising the price of gold topropping up crop prices (the Commodity Credit Corporation). As Harold Cole andLee Ohanian point out,28 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber177]the NIRA attempted to cartelize firms composing four fifths of privatenonagricultural employment. It led to huge economic distortions until it wasdeclared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in May 1935. But the level ofeconomic rigidity remaining until wartime subjected virtually the whole U.S.economy to government controls. From 1932 to 1940, the monthly unemployment rateaveraged 19 percent and never fell below 11 percent. Nonfinancial businesscapital investment as a percent of cash flows fell to 48.2 percent in 1934 and59.8 percent in 1938 but rallied in 1937 and 1941. (For 2012, the percentage, bycomparison, was 79.6 percent.) The business cycle had ups and downs in the1930s, but the level of activity for the decade, on average, was suppressed, astate consistent with today’s persistently high degree of risk aversion toilliquid long-term asset investment. The enemy of economic recovery, now asthen, is uncertainty."},{"pageContent":"EIGHTPRODUCTIVITY: THE ULTIMATE MEASURE OF ECONOMIC SUCCESSThe early stages of what became known as the dot-com boom were evident in late1993. By February 1994, we at the Federal Reserve had become sufficientlyconcerned about the pace of the expansion and the associated risks of inflationthat we decided to press down on the monetary brakes. We continued to tightenfor a year with some success. Our cumulative increase of 3 percentage points inthe federal funds rate brought a nascent stock market boom to a halt(temporarily, as it would turn out), and we were preparing ourselves for thefirst soft landing in our collective monetary policy memory. “Soft landing” is aterm that economists have borrowed from aviation to describe the aftermath of aperiod of monetary tightening that would ease an economy onto a glide path ofnoninflationary growth. The Federal Reserve’s previous experiences withaggressive tightening had often led to recession or, even worse, to a recessionthat did not succeed in restraining inflation.In July 1995, we lowered the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points, and did so againin both December 1995 and January 1996 when we read the data as suggesting thata soft landing was taking hold. But no sooner had we stopped patting ourselveson the back for adroit monetary policy than we were confronted with a seemingreeemergence of the boom. By the spring of 1996, there was clear evidence thatcyclically sensitive manufacturing activity was picking up, and the pressingquestion of whether renewed policy restraint was warranted was again on thetable. The unemployment rate had been falling since mid-1992. Wage rates andprices, however, remained remarkably subdued—a condition that ran contrary toprevailing policy wisdom that as labor markets tightened and unemployment fellbelow the presumed “natural rate” of 5.5 percent, inflationary pressures wouldmount. They didn’t.By late 1997, wage rates finally did begin to accelerate but price inflationremained contained despite stable corporate profit margins.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber178] The only way that couldhappen was for output per hour to rise at least in tandem with wage costs.Rising productivity and profit margins would also explain why new orders forcapital equipment and software had risen persistently from 1993 forward. It hadbeen my experience in the private sector that such a prolonged upswing in ordersand capital spending would not have continued unless corporate management hadjudged the rate of return on newly installed equipment to be attractive and theimprovements in productivity as real and sustainable.Given stable prices, rising wage rates, and expanding profit margins,output-per-hour growth, by my arithmetic, almost surely had to be accelerating.2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber179] The problem was that thepublished statistics gave no hint of an acceleration in productivity. The mostreliable independent measure of output per hour, our conventional proxy forproductivity, was that produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Betweenthe fourth quarter of 1993 and the fourth quarter of 1995, nonfarm productivityexhibited a tepid annual growth rate of only 0.75 percent.3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber180]My optimistic productivity message was thus not universally cheered at theFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC). As Governor Larry Meyer years laterdescribed the atmosphere in the meetings, “the staff were skeptical, and theydidn’t mind saying so. For example, at the August 1996 meeting, Mike Prell4[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber181] bluntly told theCommittee: ‘There simply isn’t any statistical evidence to suggest thatproductivity is taking off.’ I wouldn’t say the staff abandoned the Chairman inthis matter, but they came close.”5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber182] The FOMC remained spliton this issue for quite some time. Our monetary policy, of course, had toconsider whether inflation was under control. If inflation was viewed as alooming threat, the FOMC would need to contemplate tightening policy, perhapsaggressively. This was especially true given that a number of members of theFOMC noted that the Fed had made considerable progress on the maximum employmentcomponent of its dual mandate.Finally, our path became unambiguous in early 1997 when the BEA’s nonfarmbusiness productivity measure finally accelerated, reflecting the realities of aburgeoning technological boom. The federal funds rate reached 6 percent inFebruary 1995, and for the next five years it fluctuated between 4.75 percent(November 1998) and 6.5 percent (May 2000). Inflation remained subdued over thisperiod and the unemployment rate continued to decline. It finally dipped below 4percent in April 2000, without inflation visibly gaining traction.The acceleration of productivity was obviously a welcome development after itslackluster performance in the 1970s and 1980s. As financial markets digested theaccompanying implications for the expected path of earnings, stock pricesprovided a further boost to the economic expansion. However, as so often occurs,animal spirits transformed a rational capitalization of improving fundamentalsinto an “irrational exuberance” that ultimately manifested itself in theso-called dot-com bubble. Even the substantial acceleration of productivitycould not fulfill the unrealistic expectations for earnings growth that hadbecome embedded in equity valuations.So eventually, the dot-com bubble burst, resulting in a substantial decline inequity markets and household net worth. Nonetheless, the macroeconomicconsequences of that destruction of perceived wealth were, by late 2000 and into2001, surprisingly muted.6[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber183] Indeed, the accompanyingrecession, at that point, was rated as the mildest in postwar history.THE LONGER VIEWProductivity is arguably the most central measure of the material success of aneconomy. The level of productivity ultimately determines the average standard ofliving, and is a defining characteristic that separates the so-called developedworld from the developing world. Innovation, a critical determinant ofproductivity’s rate of growth, reflects how quickly new ideas are effectivelyimplemented and absorbed into the production process.Economists’ main problem with productivity is that it has been devilishlydifficult to forecast. Conventional forecasting wisdom with respect toproductivity growth is probably best epitomized by the five-year forecasts ofthe Congressional Budget Office. Exhibit 8.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_8_1] shows clearly that thesefive-year projections of output per hour are more accurately characterized asmoving averages of the recent past.7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber184] Merely projecting thatthe future will replicate the recent past may not be very edifying. But thereare nevertheless some important stabilities in long-term trends in productivity,as I note later, apparently largely rooted in human nature and culture,8[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber185] that afford us someconfidence in using the past to predict the future.Between 1870 and 1970, America’s annual rate of increase in nonfarm output perworker hour, the key measure of the productivity of our nonfarm workforce,9[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber186] averaged 2.2 percent.10[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber187] Given that theaccumulation of knowledge is largely irreversible, we would expect apersistently rising level of productivity.11[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber188] And, indeed, over anyfifteen-year period since 1889 (the first year of annual data), average yearlyoutput-per-hour growth has never exceeded 3.2 percent or fallen below 1.1percent (Exhibit 8.3 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_8_3]). But whydoes the long-term growth ceiling in the United States seem limited to a 3percent rate, and why was long-term productivity growth relatively stable formore than a century?THE MAGIC 3 PERCENT?With the exception of the immediate postwar years,12[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber189] output-per-hour growth inmost advanced economies appears to have been subject to the 3 percent growthceiling.13 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber190] But whycouldn’t the current level of technology and productivity have been achieved in,say, 1960, rather than a half century later? The answer appears to be that wehuman beings are apparently not smart enough to have produced such a leap.I suspect that the relatively stable rate of growth of productivity that weobserve from 1870 to 1970, despite the persistent degree of market churning,reflected a combination of the long-term unchanging inbred rate of timepreference, which sets the time horizon for our innovative initiatives, and ourinbred propensity toward optimism and competitiveness. They, I assume, arecapped by the upside limit of human capability to create and apply knowledgeover the long run. Certainly there is nothing to demonstrate a major differenceduring the past two millennia in the degree of intelligence of, for example,Euclid, Newton, and Einstein, the icons of outer-edge human intelligence oftheir respective eras.14 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber191]Technology may accumulate, but given the apparent ceiling to intelligence, thepace of knowledge accumulation, of necessity, is limited.MULTIFACTOR PRODUCTIVITYThe widely accepted paradigm for evaluating and projecting productivity iscalled multifactor productivity (MFP).15[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber192] Simply put, MFP is achange in output that cannot be accounted for by changes in the combined inputsof labor and capital. It is presumed that an increase in MFP is owed mainly toimprovements in technical efficiency and to the new ideas that lie behind thoseimprovements. We use the term “technology,” or, broadly speaking, applied“innovation.” MFP will also reflect increased timeliness in the transportationof people and goods; advances in communication capabilities; improvedefficiencies in the use of energy, materials, and services; economies of scale;better ways to organize production; and finally, the increasingly important useof robots that sustain the level of production but significantly decrease thenumber of human hours required to produce the output. It would be useful if wecould quantify these cost reductions in the official estimates of MFP. (Not tobe readily dismissed as a factor is measurement error. It can sometimes bedisturbingly large.) Applied innovation is a major component of output per hour,as can be seen in the equation in endnote 19 of this chapter.My former colleagues at the Federal Reserve, in one of their many relatedanalyses, documented the prominent role of both the production of informationtechnologies and their increasing use in the acceleration of labor productivitybetween 1995 and 2006.16 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber193],17 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber194]THE METRICSMultifactor analysis can be employed to forecast business output and output perhour given projections of hours, an adjustment to labor quality (the educationalattainment of the workforce, for example), capital services,18[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber195] and finally the extent ofapplied innovation (MFP).19[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber196] Capital expenditures,their level and mix, and applied innovation statistically prove to be the mostimportant determinants of labor productivity growth.The share of GDP devoted to capital investment peaked in the late 1970s ataround 25 percent and has since trended steadily downward to a low of 18 percentin 2009. The major reason, as I note in Chapter 9[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-14.xhtml], is the dramatic decline in the rate ofdomestic savings, the prime source of funding of domestic capital expenditures(along with borrowed savings from abroad). The trade-off between social benefits(mainly Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid) and savings, as I demonstratein Chapter 9 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-14.xhtml], is almost adollar-for-dollar substitution of consumption20[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber197] for gross domesticsavings. That detracts from the funding of capital investments, and hence fromoutput per hour.The diversion of the flow of savings of households from capital investment toconsumption depressed the rate of growth of the stock of productive capital, akey component of productivity growth. As I note in Chapter 9[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-14.xhtml], the pace of growth of output per hour hasslowed since the mid-70s, but remained at a still respectable 2 percent per yearuntil 2010, when it dipped to a less than 1 percent annual rate.MFP grew at an annual rate of 2.1 percent between 1947 and 1965. That pacealmost surely reflected the buildup of a large backlog of applications oftechnological insights that could not be applied during the suppressedenvironment of the 1930s, and, of course, during World War II. Apparently havingrun through the significant backlog of new ideas, the process significantlyslowed its pace of rise from 1965 to 1995. But for the next decade it regainedmomentum as the Internet’s role in information technologies during the dot-comboom broadened, and the pace of new insights and applications accelerated atclose to the early post–World War II level. The crisis of 2008, of course, put ahold on many (but by no means all) innovative applications.FORECASTING INNOVATIONForecasting innovation is particularly challenging largely because innovation(an idea or application of an idea), by definition, is something which nobodyhas previously discovered. In that sense, innovation is presumablyunforecastable. It is very easy in retrospect to identify the emergence oftelegraphy as a major innovation in the nineteenth century. But would it evenhave been imaginable to anticipate it before the identification of electricity?Certainly before the electrical properties of silicon were discovered, no onewould have imagined its monumental implications for the future.21[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber198]I suspect that the only forecasting assistance historical data can offer is tospell out the ranges of growth in innovation, say, over the past half century.We can generalize that the necessary environmental conditions for the blossomingof innovation are the enforcement of property rights and other political andeconomic conditions that have proved conducive to innovation. Propensities toinnovate can be thwarted by culture, religion, or state repression.EBBS AND FLOWS OF PRODUCTIVITY AT HOME AND ABROADFor much of the near century and a half that U.S. output per hour has been moreor less reliably measured, shortfalls in productivity growth have been followedby catch-ups that brought its level back to its long-term trend. But theunprecedented slowdown in savings starting in 1965 eventually funded apersistent below-average growth of capital investment and hence of nonfarmoutput per hour between 1973 and 1995, with estimates of growth closer to a 1.4percent annual rate than to the average annual rate between 1870 and 1970 of 2.2percent.Throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s, Japan was heralded as the economy thatwould soon displace the United States as the world’s productive powerhouse.Herman Kahn’s highly influential 1971 treatise The Emerging Japanese Superstate:Challenge and Response22 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber199]was close to subsequent conventional wisdom. That perception was reinforced bythe relatively lackluster performance of productivity in the U.S. economy andthe apparent dynamism and productiveness of Japan. Lying ahead was the dot-comdynamism of the United States and the prolonged post–1989 stagnation of Japan.Now there is an emerging belief that China will soon be displacing the UnitedStates not only in the level of GDP but eventually even in per capita GDP aswell. That conclusion is by no means self-evident. China’s spectacular growth inrecent years rests on technology largely borrowed from the rest of the world.Little to date, apparently, has been homegrown. China’s businesses have yet todemonstrate a capacity for innovation on a par with those in many advancedeconomies, most notably those of the United States. In a November 2011 study,Thomson Reuters identified what it saw as the one hundred most innovative globalcompanies. No Chinese company was on the list; America had forty.23[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber200] As I note in Chapter 10[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-15.xhtml], it is not surprising that anauthoritarian state that discourages political and other nonconformity will notsanction a climate that fosters ideas wholly out of the mainstream. Yet suchideas are the defining characteristic of innovation. It is precisely those whotread beyond the bounds of conventional behavior who innovate. Yes, growth inChinese output per employee is reported at a stunning 9.5 percent annual ratebetween 1990 and 2011. But much, if not most, of Chinese innovative technologyoriginated in developed-country firms. China is already running into rising realwage costs that have significantly narrowed their competitive advantage inglobal manufacturing. Lurking in the background is a rapidly growing roboticsindustry that substitutes low-“wage” robots24[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber201] for people. Even Chinawill have trouble competing with them. As Japan found out, forecastinginnovation is precarious.IT TAKES TIMEMost productivity increases are incremental. It takes time for new ideas tofilter through the process of trial and error and meet the test of themarketplace before adding to the level of a nation’s capacity to produce.25[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber202]Forecasting productivity from the pace of new inventions and the level ofpatents has always proved challenging (see Box 8.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-13.xhtml#box_8_1]). Only if an economicinfrastructure is ready to capitalize on an innovation can that innovationpercolate up through the economy to add to productivity. According to economichistorian Paul David of Stanford University, writing in 1989, it often takes anumber of decades for major innovations to be applied in a manner that increasesoutput per hour. As I noted in The Age of Turbulence, following Thomas Edison’sspectacular illumination of lower Manhattan in 1882, it took some four decadesfor even half of the nation’s factories to be electrified. Electric power didnot fully exhibit its superiority over steam power until a whole generation ofmultistory factories was displaced after World War I. David explains vividlywhat caused the delay. The best factory buildings of the day were poorlydesigned to take advantage of the new technology. They ran on so-called groupdrives, elaborate arrangements of pulleys and shafts that transferred power froma central source—a steam engine or water turbine—to machines throughout theplant. To avoid power losses and breakdowns, the lengths of the shared driveshafts had to be limited. This was best achieved when factories rose vertically,with one or more shafts per floor, each driving a group of machines.26[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber203]Simply substituting large electric motors to power the existing drive shafts,even when feasible, did not improve productivity very much. Factory ownersrealized that electricity’s revolutionary potential would require far moredramatic change: Power delivered by wire made central power sources, groupdrives, and the very buildings that housed them obsolete. Because electricityopened the way to equipping each production machine with its own small,efficient motor, sprawling single-story plants came into vogue. In them,machinery could readily be arranged and rearranged for greatest efficiency andmaterials could be moved about with greater ease. But abandoning city factoriesand moving to the wider spaces of the countryside was a slow, capital-intensiveprocess. That was why, David explains, electrifying America’s factories tookdozens of years. But eventually millions of acres of one-story plants embeddingelectric, motor-driven power dotted America’s midwestern industrial belt, andgrowth in output per hour finally began to accelerate.In more microexamples of absorption delay, color fashions in everyday clothingdid not become widespread until vat dying became commonplace in the 1930s, and,of course, truck transportation did not take on its full potential until ahighway system was created to facilitate its commerce after World War II.Moreover, highways fostered the development of suburbs that, in turn, improvedthe productivity of land use. The value of land almost always rises as its useshifts from sparsely settled rural environments to today’s populationconcentrations in urban areas. Denser populations tend to further refine thedivision of labor and, accordingly, boost incomes and increase the value of theland on which people live.Thus, much of today’s level of productivity rests on insights that were spawneddecades ago but could not be capitalized upon until other insights facilitatedtheir integration. A vivid example of backlogged innovation emerging asincreased output per hour occurred following the sharp contraction in economicactivity that resulted from the debacle of 2008, as I explain in Chapter 7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-12.xhtml]. The surge in output per hour from thefirst quarter of 2009 through the first quarter of 2010 reflected the dramaticcrisis-driven efforts to cut costs and concentrate on cost-saving capitalinvestment, a backlog of which had been built up during the boom years whencapital investment was primarily dedicated to expanding markets rather thanreducing costs (see Chapter 7 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-12.xhtml]).BOX 8.1: PATENTSWhat I find puzzling is that we gain so little insight into productivityforecasting from data on patents that the federal government has tabulated since1790. Patents unquestionably cover much of the innovation that in the end isreflected in gains in productivity. Accordingly, I would have expected that theywould be a useful indicator of forthcoming productivity gains. The result of theanalysis that I exhibit in Statistical Appendix 8.1 is disappointing: Patentissuance parallels but does not, as might have been expected, statistically leadnew additions to the level of productivity.ENTER FINANCEThe speed of absorption of innovations often depends importantly on theefficiency of financial markets in signaling which of a whole array ofprospective investments will add to productivity and hence profitability.As I noted in Chapter 5 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-10.xhtml], the purpose offinance is to direct the scarce savings of a society, including depreciationplus borrowed savings from abroad,27[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber204] if any, to our mostpotentially productive intellectual and physical investments. (In Chapter 10[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-15.xhtml] I address the determinants of savings andthe culture that breeds it.) When competition is pervasive and allowed tofunction,28 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber205] thoseinvestments with the highest rates of prospective return and least variance ofexpected profit also promise to contribute the most to growth in output perhour. It is the gap between the level of output per hour embodied in new capitalinvestment, presumably employing up-to-date technologies, and that ofobsolescent, low-productivity facilities (that are gradually being retired) thatover time engenders net gains in average output per hour, and hence increases inreal per capita income and standards of living.HOW IS IT DONE?But how do profit-seeking savers or their surrogates, such as hedge funds orbanks, know where to place new savings? They are guided by the signals of themarketplace: stock prices, asset prices more generally, interest rates, exchangerates, and the whole panoply of information that pours out of researchdepartments of financial firms, governments, and academia. The market signals,in turn, are driven by the chronic imbalances endemic to financial markets.These imbalances arise because some prospective investments are beinginadequately financed relative to competing investments with similar riskprofiles, and hence the latter yield abnormally (uncompetitive) high profits inthe marketplace. Rising stock prices, reflecting a shortage of invested capitalrelative to profitable performance, attract new capital inputs until demand toacquire the stock of a company is sated as the company becomes adequatelyfunded. “Overvalued” and hence overcapitalized companies, on the other hand,will yield low prospective rates of profit until the excess capital is withdrawnand presumably reinvested in more promising ventures.29[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber206]These investments address the initial capital misallocation and, because of theassociated expanding or diminishing returns, continually adjust the investment’sprospective rate of return on equity to competitive levels. This complex processis constantly churning as new information on supply, demand, and price emergesout of the ongoing competitive trading of markets and the arbitraging of allprospective rates of return (adjusted for risk) toward equality. That equality,however, is never fully achieved because new forces invariably intercede beforethe adjustment is complete.The equilibria that markets are seeking and generally closely approximate arethose governed by human propensities best described as an admixture ofneoclassical and behavioral economics. While over the long run, market prices doseem to converge on values defined by humans’ rational long-term self-interests,as described by the neoclassical school, it is decidedly not necessarily so inthe short run.30 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber207]Indeed, as the episode of the dot-com bubble made clear, on occasion, euphoriacombined with herd behavior can result in financial markets that for a timebecome divorced from realistic evaluations of future corporate earningsprospects. During this period of dot-com euphoria, funds flowed to virtually anyactivity with a “dot-com” affixed to its name, whether or not the firm had areasonable and realistic business plan and any significant prospect for making aprofit in the foreseeable future.The dot-com productivity acceleration, as my colleagues at the Federal ReserveBoard demonstrated,31 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber208] wasprimarily driven by major advances in information-processing equipment andsoftware. First, the industry itself exhibited outsized gains in output perhour. But of even greater importance, the rapid application and absorption ofsuch technologies had a major effect on virtually every niche and corner ofAmerican business and on households as well. Fed economists Stacey Tevlin andKarl Whelan32 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber209] havedemonstrated the implications for productivity measurement of the rapid declinesin prices of information-processing equipment and software, especiallycomputers. After a long period of relative price stability, prices fell at a 1.5percent annual rate between 1980 and 1985, accelerating to a 3.9 percent ratedecrease between 1985 and 2010, then slowing to a less than 1 percent annualrate of decline during the last two years (Exhibit 8.4[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_8_4]). If profit margins in theproduction of information-processing equipment and software were essentiallystable, as they apparently were, unit costs would, of necessity, be falling paripassu. Adjusting for wage rate changes, that implies an extraordinary rise inproductivity. The dot-com boom was very largely pure innovation and would beexpected to enhance MFP, as it did. Price declines for information-processingequipment and software have correlated remarkably well with MFP over the lastthree decades (Exhibit 8.4 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_8_4]).Innovation, as a driver of productivity, has always been a key component ofrising output per hour, though not always as dramatically as was evident in thefew years of the dot-com boom. Manufacturing technologies that reduce the rateof scrappage and rejects and hence reduce materials input, for example, are aninsufficiently heralded source of lowered unit cost and rising output per hour.Prior to the 1950s, for example, steel mill products’ yield from ingot averagedless than 75 percent. Ingots had to be cropped before entering the rollingmills. But with the advent of continuous casting, “home scrap” (that is,internally generated scrap) has fallen dramatically.Advances in the speed and efficiency of the transportation of goods increaseGDP. Aluminum plate is more valuable at an aerospace assembly plant than at theplate mill. The spread in the 1870s between the prices of cattle at ranches inTexas and those at the railheads in western Kansas narrowed sharply with thesubstitution of rail transport for expensive, legendarily long cattle drives.With the onset of transcontinental railroads, the time it took to move goodsfrom the East Coast to the West Coast fell from six months to six days.33[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber210] The number of workersrequired to move a ton of freight one mile fell materially, a development thatadded significantly to lower costs and hence higher national value added.Aside from the production and transportation of goods, remarkable innovativeadvances in business services also added importantly to output. Quickenedcommunication of information that facilitates the arbitraging of marketsimproves the accuracy of the vast system of relative prices, which, in turn,assists in directing our scarce savings into the most efficient technologies. Asnoted in Chapter 6 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-11.xhtml], with the introductionof effective telegraphy (1844) and especially the transatlantic cable (1866),the cost and timeliness of acquiring information that determined key decisionsin producing and moving a good to its final place of consumption fell sharply,and standards of living rose commensurately.Perhaps most important, information significantly lessens the amount of realresources required to produce any level of output because it reduces short-termuncertainties. Before this generation’s revolution in information availability,most twentieth-century short-term business decision making had been hampered byuncertainty created by inherent delays in the transfer of information. Incollege I worked part time at a department store to make ends meet. I wasastonished by how many people and how much time the store employed trying tokeep track of inventories. By the time the inventory count was completed, it wasalready out of date. Owing to such paucity of timely knowledge of customers’needs and of the real-time size and location of inventories, businessesgenerally required substantial programmed redundancies in the use of energy,materials, and people to function effectively. Because decisions were made frominformation that was days or even weeks old, production planning required costlyinventory safety stocks to respond to the inevitable unanticipated and misjudgedlevels of demand. Through most of the twentieth century, determination of theamount of inventories on hand often required laborious and time-consumingcounting of individual items. Inventories often built up for weeks beforemanagement had become sufficiently informed to curtail production.Today, executives have real-time accounting for inventories, receivables, andpayables, and can act promptly to address emerging imbalances.34[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber211] Clearly, the remarkablesurge in the availability of real-time information in recent years has enabledbusiness management to remove large swaths of inventory safety stocks (thanks tojust-in-time inventorying) and programmed redundancies of labor. That meansfewer goods and worker hours are absorbed by activities that, while perceivedone or two generations earlier as necessary insurance to sustain valued output,in the end, most often produce nothing of enduring value themselves.35[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber212]These developments emphasize the essence of information technology: theexpansion of knowledge and its obverse, the reduction of short-term uncertainty.As a consequence, risk premiums that were associated with many forms of businessactivities have permanently declined, reducing the amount of capital required toback up the information systems. In short, information technology raises outputper hour for the total economy, in part by reducing hours worked on activitiesneeded to guard productive processes against the unknown and the unanticipated.It’s worth singling out one innovation that both increases the effectiveness oflabor hours and at the same time enhances the climate-related quality control ofoutput: air-conditioning. Willis Carrier introduced the first modern form ofair-conditioning in 1902, and it quickly widened location options for plants andrevolutionized manufacturing and commerce in America’s South.THE PHYSICAL DOWNSIZING OF OUTPUTFor generations Americans had reveled in acres upon acres of massive motorvehicle assembly plants, ever taller skyscrapers, enormous dams, and longerbridge spans. I never ceased being in awe of America’s industrial might in the1950s as I drove along the south shore of Lake Michigan toward Chicago, passingone huge steel mill complex after another. But running parallel, starting in theearly postwar years, was a growing view that ever larger and more resourceintensive production had an upside limit. I recall walking the streets ofdowntown Pittsburgh in the late 1950s with coke oven ash crunching under myfeet. Pollution and the environment were terms that rarely captured publicattention, but that was about to change.In the years immediately following the war, belching smoke stacks were symbolsof industrial progress. I remember pondering in my youth where all the wastefrom the coal emitted from our chimneys ended up. I assumed, as did most of myacquaintances, that big blue skies and deep blue seas had an unlimited abilityto absorb and cleanse. It was never true of course; industrial productionimposed unpriced externalities on society. Industrial polluters were getting theservices of waste disposal for “free.” But industrial progress was very high onthe nation’s agenda, and pollution was inexorably tied to progress, hencetolerated. The same view appears to be held widely in modern-day China, althoughit may be changing.In 1962, biologist Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring detailed the effect of thewidely used pesticide DDT and other chemicals on the environment. Largely as aresult, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was born in 1970. A couple ofyears later, the Club of Rome commissioned a book, The Limits of Growth,evaluating the ever larger consumption of the world’s raw materials andspeculating about possible future chronic shortages and inflationary imbalances.That forecast did not materialize, but the notion of ever greater waste creationfrom economic growth fueled by ever more humungous structures and physical goodsremained.No doubt, the emergence of the environmental movement led to some shift intastes away from ever greater material consumption and especially away fromconsumption most likely to result in a degradation of the natural environment.This likely provided some spur to the downsizing of real output. But by far themore important factor driving down the physical component of output and drivingup the conceptual content of output was the discovery of the electricalproperties of silicon chips and the development of the integrated circuit. Thistechnological development and all the innovations that followed in its wakerevolutionized the structure of advanced economies. The fabrication ofintegrated circuits required negligible quantities of physical materials such assilicon, a natural resource in widespread abundance.DOWNSIZING AND PRODUCTIVITYThe discovery of the electrical properties of silicon and transistors created aworld in which the creation of economic value has shifted dramatically towardconceptual and impalpable values, with decidedly less reliance on physical heft.Three quarters of a century ago, our radios were bulky and activated by largevacuum tubes. Years later, owing to the insights that followed from modernelectronics, the same function was served by pocket-sized transistor packs.Today we have iPhones that also serve as cameras, flashlights, GPS, portablemedia players, and docks for a seemingly endless (and growing) list ofapplications, all in a small handheld device. Moreover, there were othersignificant technological downsizing developments well beyond the silicon chip.Metal beverage cans are now rolled to thinner tolerances than was conceivabledecades ago. Lightweight fiber optics replaced vast tonnages of copper.Space-heating technology enabled reduction in the fabric weight of apparelbecause people didn’t need to wear warm clothes indoors. Advances inarchitecture and engineering, and the development and use of lighter butstronger materials, now give us the same working space in newer buildings withfar less concrete and steel tonnage than was required decades ago.Even the physical quantity of goods consumed in creating economic services hasbeen affected. Financial transactions that historically were buttressed withreams of paper are now memorialized electronically. The transportation servicesindustry now moves more goods with greater convenience, while consumingsubstantially less fuel per ton mile of transportation.The considerable increase in the economic well-being of most advanced nations inrecent decades has come about without much change in the bulk or weight of theirgross domestic products. The weight of nonfuel raw materials that are consumedin the United States has not been growing measurably since the late 1970s(Exhibit 8.5 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_8_5]), with rawtonnages no greater today than they were three or four decades ago. This meansthat increases in the conceptual components of GDP—that is, those componentsreflecting advances in knowledge and ideas—explain almost all of the rise inreal GDP in the United States, and presumably elsewhere in the industrial world.Services, at constant prices, however, with no physical weight, are roughly thesame share of real GDP as they were in 1949, and hence have contributed onlymodestly to downsizing. The brunt of the change has been in the downsizing ofgoods.So the economy has gotten lighter without question. Quantifying this, however,is not all that straightforward. Similarly, measuring the weight of GDP isdifficult. We cannot put the total GDP on a scale and read off the number oftons. We do have estimates of the total (nonfuel) tonnages of raw materials thatenter into goods production, and if we assume that the physical weight of inputis proportional to the tons of output, we would have an unambiguous measure ofGDP output tonnage. In practice, however, technological advances have probablyimproved the ratio of output to input.36[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber213]But the key measure of output—real GDP—raises a series of questions. Real GDP issupposed to measure nominal GDP in dollars of constant purchasing power. Thatrequires a measure of price that reflects and incorporates the ever-changingquality of goods. A new car purchased in 2013 almost certainly has many featuresundreamed of by the purchaser of a new car in 1998. I am astounded at how closewe are to being able to vocally direct our cars while sitting back and enjoyingthe ride. There is a vast economic literature on how to convert nominal dollarsinto constant (real) dollars, and unending changes over the years in thestatistical techniques employed. What the Bureau of Economic Analysis seeks is aquality-adjusted price for goods and services, most recently a measure of thequality-adjusted real output in 2005 dollars.37[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber214]To estimate the weight in tons of U.S. GDP goods, I employed the data compiledby the U.S. Census Bureau on both the value and weight of imports and exportstransported by water and air back to 1953. Those data enable us to calculate theweight of both imports into the U.S. production process and exports ultimatelydestined to contribute to production abroad, relative to the constant 2005dollar value of imports and exports.For U.S. imports since 1955, the ratio of weight to real (constant 2005 dollar)value has fallen by a relatively stable 3.1 percent annual rate. Since 1977, theratio has declined by an average of 4.6 percent per year (Exhibit 8.6[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_8_6]). Assuming that this ratio canbe applied more broadly to all private real goods output in the United Statescreates a tonnage estimate for aggregate output that is broadly consistent withan independent compilation of raw commodity inputs into the production process,such as iron and copper ore, cement, and steel scrap (Exhibit 8.7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_8_7]).38[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber215] Both estimates indicatethat the weight of private GDP output has leveled off since the 1970s. Ofcourse, the composition of imports is not the same as the composition of theeconomywide goods GDP. But there is little evidence that this ratio issignificantly biased by the shifting composition of imports, at least relativeto tonnage estimates.THE TURNING POINTThe correlation between growing economic activity and growing weight of real GDPapparently peaked in the late 1970s. In recent years, the conceptualcontribution to economic activity has reflected importantly the explosive growthin information gathering and processing techniques, which have greatly extendedour capability to substitute ideas for physical volume.In the years ahead, telecommunications and advanced computing will doubtlesstake on an even greater role. By expediting the transfer of ideas, informationtechnology creates value by facilitating the substitution of intellectual forphysical labor in the production process, much as the American railroads in anearlier time created value by transferring physical goods to geographiclocations where relative shortages made those goods more valuable. At the turnof the last century, for example, we created economic value in the United Statesby moving iron ore from Minnesota’s Mesabi Range down to furnaces in Pittsburgh,where it was joined with West Virginia coal to produce steel. In today’senvironment, economic value is increasingly created by fitting ever smallersilicon chips ever closer together with still larger data capacity than earlier,much bulkier units. At least to date, Moore’s law still prevails. (Though asGordon Moore himself recognized, miniaturization has physical limits that somesee approaching in the near term.39[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber216])THE BENEFITSTwo clear benefits of the economy’s “weight loss” are the reduced depletion ofthe world’s finite natural resources in the context of growing populations andthe expansion of international trade. Obviously, the smaller the bulk and thelower the weight, the easier it is to move goods across national boundaries.High-value computer products are a major and increasing factor in globaltrade.40 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber217]Also implicit in the downsizing of products is the increased integration of manyof the world’s production facilities. Inflationary bottlenecks tend to emergewhen domestic productive facilities are pressed to capacity by burgeoningdomestic demand. But if additional supplies from other world producers can bemade readily and quickly available, such pressures can be significantly eased,effectively reducing the level of domestic capacity required for any givenglobal demand for a commodity. The cost of moving gravel across continents makesit difficult to envisage foreign gravel pits as backup for excess domesticdemand. But the ease with which downsized electronic components can be movedessentially integrates much of the world’s electronic component capacity.Misplaced or displaced production facilities become a much smaller problem.Thus, as we move beyond the current crisis and the general downsizing ofeconomic output continues, worldwide production and inventory controls becomefar more feasible and price pressures associated with production dislocationsless likely. One can only imagine the downsizing that will emerge with maturingnanotechnology and 3-D printing. Goods or their electronic versions mayeventually be moved in a manner that brings to mind Star Trek’s instantaneousteleportation devices.MILLENNIA OF STAGNATIONMany, if not most, innovations fail and are quickly forgotten. But innovatorskeep trying. We are continually pressing forward. Life and our competitivepropensity seemingly require it. However, if innovation and productivity growthis a human propensity, why was it essentially stagnant for nearly two millenniaprior to the eighteenth century’s Age of Enlightenment?41[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber218] Clearly, the propensityto enhance our material state of living is a necessary but not a sufficientcondition for the actual achievement of such growth.Economic growth requires that the interactions between market participants aregoverned by a rule of law in which the rights of ownership are effectivelyenforced; it implies a legal framework (for example, contract law) thatfacilitates the free interchange of goods and services in a society. Economicgrowth also requires a degree of abstinence from consumption to provide thesavings required to fund a sufficiently large addition to our capital stockthat, in turn, is needed to leverage human inventiveness on the path to risinglevels of productivity. The insights of the eighteenth century’s John Locke,David Hume, and Adam Smith, among others, developed such a framework that spreadrapidly throughout the then-developed world, accelerating standards of materialwell-being twentyfold in the subsequent more than two centuries. Real per capitaGDP of the Western world, according to economic historian Angus Maddison42[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber219], which had been virtuallystagnant during the millennium preceding the eighteenth century, has acceleratedat a 1.7 percent annual rate since 1820. Productivity trends will have more todo with material standards of living in, say, 2030 than any other singleeconomic statistic.STATISTICAL APPENDIX 8.1To place both productivity and patent issuance on a comparable basis, I treatthe annual series of output per hour (a flow) from the perspective that it isthe stock of cumulative embedded technology. In essence, the level ofproductivity is best thought of as being a measure of the previously accumulatedlevel of knowledge.43 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber220]I then assume that the rate of depreciation of the real capital stock, asestimated by the BEA, can be substituted (not implausibly) for the annual rateof depreciation of the “stock” of accumulated technology (output per hour). Thegross additions to the stock of technology are then estimated by adding the netchange in the technology stock during the year to the amount of depreciationestimated from the BEA rate of depreciation of the related real capital stock.That series is shown in Exhibit 8.8[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_8_8] along with annual patentissuance. Both series are measures of gross new additions to the infrastructurethat produces productivity. Patent issuance, as I concluded, does parallel grossadditions to the stock of productivity but does not lead it."},{"pageContent":"NINEPRODUCTIVITY AND THE AGE OF ENTITLEMENTSOn August 14, 1935, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed into law astatute that was destined to have an enormous effect on America’s economy andthe nation’s politics for the next three quarters of a century. It was theSocial Security Act. From its beginnings, Social Security tried to project theaura of private fully funded insurance; beneficiaries perceived Social Securitynot as charity or welfare but as a return, with interest, on the contributionsthey and their employers paid into a fund during their working years.I remember well the first meeting of the 1983 National Commission on SocialSecurity Reform (NCSSR). We were tasked to solve a problem, namely, that theSocial Security trust funds were about to run out of money. During our firstmeeting, I, as the commission’s chairman, had assumed that when confronted withthe distasteful choice of raising Social Security taxes or decreasing benefits,the commission might opt instead for the easy political solution: replenish thedepleted trust funds from the Treasury’s general revenues. It would require nomore than a bookkeeping entry.So I reluctantly concluded that if we, as a commission, were headed in thatdirection, we might as well do it quickly and save time and effort, and I saidso. I was surprised, however, when Claude Pepper, a Democratic congressman fromFlorida and a longtime idol to supporters of Social Security, arose inindignation and denounced such an action. He argued that it would brand SocialSecurity as “welfare.” The rest of the commission quietly acquiesced, includingsuch formidable political heavyweights as senators Bob Dole, John Heinz, DanielPatrick Moynihan, and AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland. Pepper’s successfulintervention effectively required the commission to address the politicallydifficult choices of raising taxes, reducing benefits, or, as was finally thecase, both.The issue was still sufficiently politically sensitive three decades later thatduring the heat of the 2012 presidential campaign President Barack Obama feltthe need to assert that “Medicare and Social Security are not handouts.”1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber221] In a similar vein, anadvertisement for the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) had aretiree (or an actor) reiterate the belief that “I earned my Medicare and SocialSecurity.”2 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber222]WORDS MATTERIn social and political discourse, how ideas are characterized matters a greatdeal. Whether a payment from one person to another, or from government tocitizen, is characterized as “charity” or an earned “entitlement” has profoundimplications on politically influenced economic behavior. Charity has alwaysbeen considered a highly moral act from the giver’s perspective, but to almostall who perceive themselves with pride as solidly self-reliant, to fall into astate of charitable dependence is a very debilitating blow to their self-esteem.It is particularly apparent when middle-class families, proud of achievingself-sufficiency, are forced by circumstances to become recipients of charity—inthe wake, for example, of natural disasters.3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber223] Moreover, as theEconomist noted, “Plenty of poor people in America are wary of programmes likethe Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) because the idea of getting a handout fromthe government reinforces a sense of helplessness.”4[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber224]But the perception that Social Security trust funds replicate private pensiontrust funds has long diverged from the reality. The contributions by employeesand their employers, plus interest, set aside to fund promised future benefits,have fallen far short of what fully funded private defined benefit pension fundswould have required.5 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber225], 6[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#ManualEndnote] The trust funds havestruggled and failed even to keep payments on a pay-as-you-go basis withouttransfers from Treasury general revenues. The Social Security trust funds havedone better than the Medicare Fund, but under current projections of theiractuaries, they will run out of funds in 2033. The Medicare fund will becomeinsolvent by 2026.7 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber227]The size of the full funding shortfall was documented by the actuaries of theSocial Security trust fund in early 2013. To achieve “sustainable solvency” overthe long run, they concluded, would require a permanent tax increase on payrollsof 4.0 percentage points (an increase of almost a third), or a permanent cut inbenefits of almost one fourth, or some combination of the two. Every year ofdelay in implementing a fix would increase the required size of subsequentpolicy action. The actuaries argued in 2013 that Social Security’s officialarbitrary convention for budget “solvency” of only a seventy-five-year fundinghorizon “can lead to incorrect perceptions and . . . policyprescriptions. . . .”8 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber228], 9[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber229] I might add that theMedicare Board of Trustees was also skeptical of the estimates on Medicarefunding they were required to make under current law. They noted in the 2012report that projected Medicare spending will require “unprecedented improvementsin health care provider productivity. . . . Given these uncertainties, futureMedicare costs could be substantially larger than shown in the Trustees’current-law projection.”10[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber230], 11[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber231]EARLY PERCEPTIONSI recall that when I was a freshman in college, President Harry S. Truman tookpains, in describing his broad national health-care initiative (a precursor toMedicare), to emphasize that his proposal was “not socialized medicine” whenaddressing the Congress in 1945.12[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber232] That pejorative termresonated in early postwar America, and it was used successfully for years tofend off such legislation.Medicare finally became law in 1965, and took on the same actuarial trappings asSocial Security. But it was only partly financed with a hospital trust fund,which also has long since failed to meet any notion of full funding. Individualand employer contributions to the fund fall far short of what would be necessaryto ensure long-term solvency. Beneficiaries get social insurance at asubstantial discount under its true cost.THE BARGAINGiven these subsidized bargain prices for retirement and health benefits, andthe government-guaranteed certainty of payment, it is no surprise that they havebecome overwhelmingly politically popular. The electoral power of entitlementprograms has been painfully evident to those who, in running for politicaloffice, suggest even a modest paring of future benefits. There is a bipartisanview that Social Security is the “third rail” for politicians: “Touch it and youlose.” Political constituencies vigorously defending each social benefit haveorganized around every new entitlement program; such entitlements, oncebestowed, have proved extremely difficult to rescind or even reduce. In thispolitical atmosphere, social insurance inexorably expanded to broader andbroader coverage. It soon became a political grab bag for buying votes—by bothDemocrats and Republicans. Fiscal probity was nowhere in sight.After decades of moderate growth, social benefit programs gained unexpectedmomentum. As Exhibit 9.1 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_9_1]demonstrates, between 1965 and 2012, the average annual rate of increase ofsocial benefits exceeded 9.4 percent, as benefits’ share of GDP rose from 4.7percent to 14.9 percent. Particularly surprising has been the fact that it wasnot the political descendants of FDR but “fiscally prudent” Republicanadministrations who led the charge. Since 1969, during the Republicanadministrations, social benefit spending rose by 10.4 percent annually (Reagan’smark was 7.3 percent). Meanwhile, “spendthrift” Democrats since 1965 oversaw a“mere” 8.1 percent annual increase (Clinton’s was 4.5 percent). Of the overallrise, 40 percent occurred during the twenty years of Democratic administrationsand 60 percent during the twenty-eight years of Republican administrations.This seeming political anomaly was explained to me by President Richard Nixon(who introduced automatic indexing of Social Security benefits in 1972): “If we(Republicans) don’t preempt the Democrats and get the political credit, they(the Democrats) will.” Much to my retrospective distress, neither presidentsFord nor Reagan, for whom I worked, could or would effectively constrain thebenefits juggernaut.THE TECTONIC POLICY SHIFTWhat was it about the early 1960s that set the stage for the remarkable surge inwhat later became known as “government social benefit payments to persons”?13[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber233] Certainly in the eightyears of the Eisenhower presidency, the shift to expansive economic and fiscalpolicy was nowhere on the political horizon. In his 1956 State of the Unionaddress, President Dwight D. Eisenhower captured the ethos of his time: “Apublic office is, indeed, a public trust. None of its aspects is more demandingthan the proper management of the public finances. I refer . . . to the prudent,effective and conscientious use of tax money. . . . Over the long term, abalanced budget is a sure index to thrifty management—in a home, in a businessor in the Federal Government.”14[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber234] In the political world,budget deficits were then considered as worrisome to the nation’s economichealth as they are to the financial health of a household unable to make endsmeet.This broadly held notion was quietly shelved by the breakout of Keynesianeconomics from the heady but cloistered atmosphere of academia to the “practicalworld” of everyday American politics. That breakout was facilitated by the firstAmerican president born in the twentieth century, John F. Kennedy, who, oncoming to office in January 1961, brought with him a coterie of academiceconomists thoroughly schooled in the early versions of what we now callKeynesian macroeconomic policy. I trace the beginnings of the social benefitsboom in part, at least, to what President Kennedy’s Council of Economic Advisersin the 1960s called “fiscal drag,” a persistent propensity toward budgetrestraint. As President Kennedy himself put it later, “Only when we have removedthe heavy drag our fiscal system now exerts on personal and business purchasingpower and on the financial incentives for greater risk-taking and personaleffort can we expect to restore the high levels of employment and high rate ofgrowth that we took for granted in the first decade after the war.”15[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber235]FISCAL DRAGThe economy was expanding rapidly in the early 1960s with impressiveproductivity growth. Tax revenues were flowing into the U.S. Treasury at a pacethat, to the Council of Economic Advisers, conjured up the specter of largedeflationary federal surpluses. And indeed, from 1959 to 1966, the federalgovernment’s net savings was in rare surplus.16[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber236] But there was no shortageof recommended remedies. The tax cut of 1964 and the riveting (and expensive)venture to send an American to the moon were in the forefront of initiatives tocounter the feared drag of budget surpluses. But none matched the expansion ofsocial benefit programs. With both Democrats and Republicans vying to outpromiseeach other, the seeds of the historic entitlement boom were being sown.As social benefit spending accelerated, government savings as a percent of GDPbegan, with little fanfare, to decline, turning negative in the 1970s (Exhibit9.2 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-14.xhtml#exhibit_9_2]).17[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber237] Since 2009, annualgovernment dissavings (deficits) have exceeded 5 percent of GDP.Between 1965 and 2012, as a consequence of falling government savings, totalgross domestic savings (as a percent of GDP) declined from 22.0 percent to 12.9percent, or 9.1 percentage points. The erosion of U.S. gross domestic savings asa percent of GDP, in peacetime, is historically unprecedented. (See Box 9.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-14.xhtml#box_9_1].)As can be seen from Exhibit 9.2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-14.xhtml#exhibit_9_2], the 9.3-percentage-point fallin government savings as a share of GDP since 1965 is more than accounted for bythe sharp rise in social benefit spending. No other component of either receiptsor outlays of federal, state, and local financing exhibited changing shares ofGDP large enough to credibly be seen as a major contributor to the dramaticdecline in government savings (Exhibit 9.3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_9_3]).18[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber238], 19[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber239] And because privatesavings as a share of GDP was unchanged between 1965 to 2012, social benefitsare also the major contributor to the decline in overall gross domesticsavings.20 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber240]17719.jpg [../Images/17719.jpg]BOX 9.1: BACK TO BASICS ON SAVINGSOne of the most fundamental propositions of economics is that advances instandards of living require savings. Part of ancient harvests were set aside asseed grain for future plantings or as insurance against famine owing to cropfailure. People soon realized that abstaining from immediate consumption tobuild tools enhanced future production, consumption, and standards of living.They accordingly chose to divert their physical effort to producing hammers andaxes, rather than producing food. Much later came the evolution of finance, anincreasingly sophisticated system that enabled savers to hold liquid claims(deposits) with banks and other financial intermediaries. Those claims could beinvested by banks in financial instruments that, in turn, represented the netclaims against the productivity-enhancing tools of a complex economy. Financialintermediation was born. This system financed the industrial revolution andmodern capitalism.But even in complex modern economies, the buildup of capital assets stillrequires the forgoing of consumption to allow part of output to be saved andinvested in productive capital assets. This principle is no less true insophisticated modern economies than it was when ancient farmers diverted part oftheir crops to seed grain for the next year’s harvest.As I’ve said, for the past century and a half, savings by our economy’s privatesector—business and households—has exhibited no discernible long-term trend,presumably mirroring the stability of real interest rates. With the exception oftwo world wars and the Great Depression of the 1930s, annual gross privatesavings21 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber241] have hoveredbetween 15 percent and 20 percent of GDP since 1886 (Exhibit 9.5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_9_5]). Government savings—federal,state, and local—in peacetime also were stable, ranging between 0 percent and 5percent of GDP for the century leading up to 1965. Prudence characterized publicfinance.Evidence22 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber242] indicates thatAmerican savings rates (and investment rates) relative to GDP were climbingduring the first half of the nineteenth century. Human nature, of course, didnot change, but the new American economy was building up its infrastructure andnew political institutions. The data do show persuasively that private savingsrates had reached their equilibrium by the 1880s. (See also Box 1.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-6.xhtml#box_1_1].)BOX 9.2: ALTERNATE VIEWSThere are many other views of the cause of decline in the domestic savings rate.Certainly, the mere existence of government-guaranteed retirement and healthbenefits must have lowered the level of current savings. Before such guarantees,people had to set aside additional savings for their old age. The high savingsrates among Chinese households are often attributed to that country’s lack of aneffective retirement funding regime. It is very difficult to measure the effectof government retirement guarantees on the level of savings of U.S. households.But why has the savings rate continued to fall over the decades? The governmentguarantee has not changed since the inception of Social Security.A more compelling alternative to the thesis I have presented in this chapter isthe suppression of the level of gross domestic savings, owing to the existenceof capital gains on stocks and homes that the data show drive personalconsumption expenditures higher (and savings lower). Capital gains and, moregenerally, the buildup of household net worth, doubtless have a measurableinfluence on the level of household savings. But most important, it cannotexplain the decline in gross domestic savings as a percent of GDP. As can beseen in Exhibit 9.6 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_9_6], the shareof personal consumption expenditures attributable to changes in net worth soaredfor a decade (1997 to 2007), but by 2012, the share had fallen back to where itwas in 1965 (12.2 percent). Thus, little if any of the downtrend in thehousehold savings rate can be tied to household net worth.ONE TO ONENot only can benefit spending be seen as displacing gross domestic saving, butin recent years it has also been displacing it on almost a dollar-for-dollarbasis. Since 1965, much of the sum of social benefit spending and gross totaldomestic savings has remained in the remarkably narrow range of 26 percent to 30percent of GDP (Exhibit 9.7 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_9_7]).Had the ratio of benefits plus savings to GDP been fixed at 28 percent, forexample, every dollar of benefit rise would have, of necessity, reduced domesticsavings by exactly one dollar. What is important, as I will document, is that asignificant part of the surge in benefit spending and consumption was funded bygovernment preemption of private savings (by taxation) that would otherwise havegone to fund domestic capital investment.23[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber243]CROWDING OUTSocial benefit spending is not subject to market forces.24[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber244] It is determined whollyby entitlements and appropriated budget funds that are transferred tobeneficiaries irrespective of market conditions. They are, as economists like toput it, an “independent variable.” The remainder of the economy has been forcedto adjust to the bulge in benefit spending.Government deficits can, and do, crowd out other borrowers. The federalgovernment will outbid all other potential claimants to the nation’s private(and sometimes state and local government) savings to ensure that its ex postdeficit is equal to its ex ante deficit.25[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber245] The federal government,the only issuer of sovereign credit,26[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber246] is the“eight-hundred-pound gorilla” in the marketplace, and every other claimant forprivate savings is forced to stand in line behind the U.S. Treasury. Privatesector participants then jockey for the limited leftover funds available. Theallocation of savings is driven indirectly by higher interest rates—especiallyrates that apply to less than investment grade borrowers—curtailing capitalinvestments that the ex ante savings were scheduled to fund. 27[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber247]IT TAKES TWODeficit spending thus requires two parties: the government, which is almostalways a net borrower of funds, and the private sector and/or foreign investors,who directly or indirectly lend the money. If the federal government cannotinduce investors to buy its bonds, deficit spending cannot exist. There arelimits to “real” deficit spending.28[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber248] Because it must befinanced with private savings, it competes for the consumer dollar with theantisaving propensities of keeping up with the Joneses and herd behavior–drivenconspicuous consumption. The pool of private savings from which governments fundtheir deficits rarely breaches 20 percent of GDP, an apparent upper limit to theamount Americans will voluntarily save out of income (Exhibit 9.5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_9_5]). In World War II, it tookofficial rationing and patriotic fervor to suppress the level of consumption andfacilitate a marked rise in household savings to help fund the war.29[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber249] If our government triesto run deficits that exceed ex ante available private savings, it would induceeither a rise in interest rates and/or force the Federal Reserve to accommodatethe increased supply of bonds, as it did in World War II, requiring wage andprice controls to suppress inflation.LENDING AND BORROWINGIn the United States, of necessity, all lending ex post must be somebody else’sborrowing. Hence, the sum of each must be identical.30[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber250] That is true, however,only if we include foreign lending as borrowing by U.S. residents. Because alltransactions with foreigners have both an American and a foreign counterpart, itis possible to view the current account balance of payments (deficit or surplus)solely from the American side (which, of course, must be identical to theforeign side, with sign reversed). Thus, having classified our transactions withforeigners as a domestic sector, the borrowing and lending between Americans isalways equal, and the difference between the two always zero. Since netborrowing is also equivalent to investment less savings, it follows that, withnet borrowing for the United States as a whole always zero, ex post, savingsmust always equal investment. All this necessary balancing derives from thenature of double-entry bookkeeping (see Box 9.3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-14.xhtml#box_9_3]).BOX 9.3: DOUBLE ENTRYBecause every market transaction has both a buyer and a seller, there are twosets of books—double entry—but only a single set of transaction values. For amarket transaction to occur, both sides must agree to the same terms—forexample, the price and value of the exchange. Hence, added up separately, thevarious aggregates from the two sets of books must yield identical results.Gross domestic product, for example, must equal gross domestic income,31[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber251] and when we limit thesummations to capitalized transactions32[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber252] only, savings must equalinvestment. It is those equalities that lock the two sets of matching accountstogether.However, were the widely differing intentions of people to invest or save (ortheir equivalent, to borrow or lend) recorded as they enter the marketplace,they would exhibit no such equalities. In general, ex post prices tend to behigher than consumers would prefer and lower than suppliers would prefer. Marketnegotiations pit “bids” against “asked” until agreement is reached betweenbuyers and sellers. Counterparties come together on the specific terms of theirtransaction and in the process set prices of products and assets, as well asinterest and exchange rates.Double-entry bookkeeping has the real world role of preventing internalinconsistencies in forecasts. Inconsistencies can exist for ex ante demand andsupply, but not once market forces set the terms of transactions to a pointwhere agreements are reached and market transactions are completed. Double entrymerely recognizes such agreements. It is a requirement that, for transactions tohave occurred and economic activity to have taken place, supply equaled demand.That result cannot be altered by outcomes of other equations in the model; it iswhat economists call an “identity”—that is, definitional equality. Markets resetall prices (for products and assets) and interest and exchange rates until theallocation of lending and borrowing (savings less investment) among sectors sumsto zero. Thus, for sectoral balance to be achieved, given a rise in federaldeficits, for example, some other sector must have been crowded out.The end result of double-entry bookkeeping transactions is a set of accountsthat are tied together by the terms of agreements already reached. Theaccounting merely records the same set of transactions from two differentperspectives. Gross domestic income is equal to gross domestic product becausethe former is merely a set of accounts that identify the nature of the incomeclaims to each reported good and service that makes up the GDP. Because what ismeasured is the same thing but from different perspectives, the sum of eachseparate account must be identical.IT MATTERSThese tautological relationships would be of little interest outside ofaccounting formalities if it weren’t for the fact that the federal government,when funding its deficits, preempts part of the supply of private savings;households and/or business, once their transactions in the marketplace arecomplete, must have borrowed less than they intended and lent more than theyintended. For this to happen, one or more private sectors must experience someform of crowding out, either interest rate crowding out or self-imposedcorporate culture–induced crowding out.In the former case, the interest rates borrowers are required to pay render theinvestments that the savings are supposed to fund unprofitable. Interest ratecrowding out is, of course, not uniform across business and households. AAA oreven A credits rarely get crowded out. Most of the projects that are put back onthe shelf because interest rates are too high are those of less than investmentgrade businesses or subprime home mortgage borrowers.33[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber253]PRIVATE SAVINGSWhile overall gross private savings as a share of GDP has shown a remarkablestability, the same cannot be said for the proportion of its major components:households and business. Since 1965, and especially since 1984, gross householdsavings as a share of GDP have declined and gross business savings as a share ofGDP have risen as an offset (see Exhibit 9.4[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_9_4]). The latter has occurredowing to ever rising depreciation as a share of GDP. The household savings ratedeclined largely as a consequence of social benefit consumption crowding outhousehold saving.There is always a great deal of transferring of funds in both directions betweengovernment and the private sector: the government—federal, state, andlocal—takes in tax receipts from households and businesses and makes payouts tohouseholds and businesses. When the federal government receives contributionsfor social insurance from employees who save little of their income, and thenturns around and sends checks for comparable amounts to beneficiaries who alsosave little, the overall effect on the gross domestic savings rate isnegligible. But when tax receipts from upper income savers are transferred tolower income beneficiaries, gross domestic savings decline by the amount of thetransfer, times the difference between the savings rates of the taxed upperincome groups (high) and that of the social insurance beneficiaries (low).But determining the size of the crowding out of savings by benefit spending isnot a simple matter of comparing the average savings rates of taxed householdsand that of beneficiaries. It is their marginal rates that matter. For example,a modest cut in income tax rates for a millionaire household is apt to havelittle to no effect on its level of spending on consumer goods and services.Hence, almost all, if not all, of the tax cut would go to savings. The marginalsavings rate at that income level is thus close to, if not at, 100 percent.CALCULATING MARGINAL SAVINGS RATESThe marginal savings rate for upper income quintile households (calculated fromthe sample BLS Consumer Expenditure Surveys) is shown for 1984 to 2011 inExhibit 9.9 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-14.xhtml#exhibit_9_9].34[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber254] After adjusting thosedata to be consistent with BEA savings levels (also shown), the marginal savingsrate averages 46 percent over the time frame, but has not trended upwards.*[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-6_fn1.xhtml#footnote-1443-4]I then estimate the extent that taxation of upper income households financessocial spending (and hence contributes to the decline in both household andtotal domestic saving).*[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-6_fn1.xhtml#footnote-1443-5] Between 1979 and 2009,according to the CBO, the upper quintile’s share of total individual taxliabilities, driven by our rising degree of income inequality,35[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber255] increased from 65 percentin 1979 to 94 percent by 2009, the latest available data.36[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber256]Gross domestic savings declined from 22.04 percent of GDP in 1965 to 12.88percent in 2012 (see Exhibit 9.3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_9_3]). Of the decrease of 9.16percentage points, 2.51 points (27 percent) was contributed by direct taxationof upper income quintile households, diverting savings from investment toconsumption. In addition to estimating federal individual income tax liabilitiesattributable to upper income quintile households, the CBO also estimates theultimate tax incidence of corporate, payroll, and excise taxes of upper quintileearners. Those taxes are levied before incomes are paid to households ratherthan on income already received. I estimate that the reduction of savings of theupper income quintile through this channel accounts for an additional decreaseof two percentage points of GDP, or 22 percent of the decline in gross domesticsavings over the past half century. Taxation directly or indirectly of the upperincome quintile thus accounts for almost half of the decline in gross savingssince 1965. The remainder of the decline is attributable to increased benefitspending unmatched by tax receipts.17799.jpg [../Images/17799.jpg]FUNDING CAPITAL INVESTMENTOnly savings can create a claim on productive capital assets. It is only whenincome exceeds consumption that a household has a surplus and must determinewhether it uses the surplus to pay off debt, increase home equity, or accumulatebank deposits and other financial assets. Banks or other financialintermediaries will reinvest their newly acquired inflow of monies to fund someof the economy’s fixed capital assets and inventories. Household consumption, onthe other hand, by definition, leaves no further imprint on household balancesheets.Only because we borrowed savings from abroad were we able to limit the declinein domestic capital investment (as a percent of GDP) to 5 percentage points—from21.4 percent in 1965 to 16.2 percent in 2012—little more than half of thedecline in gross domestic savings (Exhibit 9.3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_9_3]). Yet as I detail later inthis chapter, even this decline was enough to slow the rate of growth of nonfarmoutput per hour (productivity) from the relatively stable 2.2 percent per annumthat prevailed on average for a century (1870 to 1970) (see Chapter 8[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-13.xhtml]), to a 2.0 percent rate between 1965 and2012—a consequential difference.THE PRICE OF BENEFITSThus, the benefits surge that began in 1965, while clearly a huge politicalsuccess, appears to have lowered the growth rate of real gross domestic privatenonfarm business product by 0.21 percent per annum. That may seem small, butcumulatively, over the past half century, 0.21 percent per annum had created agap (hypothetical less actual) by 2011 of almost a tenth of real gross privatenonfarm business product and somewhat less for real GDP (see StatisticalAppendix 9.1). That counterfactual projected GDP gap amounted to approximately$1.1 trillion by 2011, half the rise in social benefits payments of $2.2trillion that occurred between 1965 and 2011. The evidence suggests that theresources required to augment the benefits of the elderly came largely at theexpense of the lower income quintile households, almost wholly throughsuppressed wage rate gains. Profit margins were not materially affected.37[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber257]A hypothetical loss of a never-experienced standard of living, of course, is notcomparable to a visible and painful setback, such as the evaporation ofretirement assets during the stock market collapse of 2008. If the properties ofsilicon and integrated circuits were never discovered, would we be mourning theloss of a never-existing Internet?These calculations indicate that if social benefits as a percent of GDP hadstayed unchanged after 1965, the resulting gains in GDP would have yielded anannual increase in nonfarm output per hour of 2.2 percent between 1965 and 2011(compared with the actual 2.0 percent), the same rate of growth that prevailedbetween 1870 and 1970. That result reinforces the hypothesis that productivitygrowth would not have slowed down materially from its century-long uptrend hadbenefits’ share of GDP not increased after 1965.38[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber258] Average production workerwage levels would certainly have been higher than those engendered by the tepidincreases that have prevailed in recent years. (Productivity growth still wouldhave been significantly slower, however, relative to the initial postwar risebetween 1948 and 1965 that averaged an impressive 3.1 percent per year.)From 1992 to 2008, we borrowed an ever-increasing share of GDP from abroad tohelp fund our domestic capital investment, ballooning our current accountdeficit to 6 percent of GDP in 2006. With the collapse of domestic investmentduring 2008, the need for foreign borrowing has slowed. But as recently as 2011,annual borrowing remained large, mainly from China ($315 billion), Japan ($82billion), and the Middle East ($45 billion), out of a total current accountdeficit of $466 billion (3.1 percent of GDP). We are borrowing resources fromour children and the rest of the world to be repaid . . . when?THE NEED FOR CONTAINMENTUnless the upward momentum of entitlement spending is contained and turnedaround, the erosion of our gross domestic savings rate will almost surelycontinue to suppress capital spending, productivity, and growth in standards ofliving, as it has done incrementally for nearly a half century. Net domesticsavings are now close to zero. Unless we increase our current rate of borrowingfrom abroad, additions to our productive capital stock will fall further.We have pretty much exhausted the low-hanging fruit that has helped fund therise in benefits as a share of GDP, yet the bulk of baby-boomer retirementsstill lies ahead. The almost certain further rise in benefits, I presume, willbe funded by additional reductions in discretionary spending, as some of ourmilitary and financial commitments continue to wind down. That will leavedefense spending in 2019, as a share of GDP, at its lowest point since 1940, andnondefense discretionary federal spending (as a share of GDP) at the lowestlevels in more than a half century. Social benefit funding from additionalreductions in “discretionary” spending, both defense and nondefense, will thusbecome ever more difficult. Moreover, we are left with little buffer to fundunanticipated new military imperatives or major hurricane-related reliefprograms, for example, short of printing money—a policy that carries its ownproblems (see Chapter 13 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-18.xhtml]).OUR GLOBAL REACHWe are the world’s reserve currency, which grants us special access to theworld’s savings. That has given the United States an extraordinary degree offlexibility to act on the world stage. But our heavy borrowing from abroad since1992 has brought our international investment position from a net credit in 1986(and for many years earlier) to a net debt of nearly $5 trillion at the end of2012. Presumably, we can continue to pawn or sell the nation’s capital assets tofund growing social benefit consumption, at least for a while. But there is alimit to a reserve currency country’s accumulation of foreign borrowings. Shouldthe United States ever reach that limit and sources of new foreign funding dryup, social benefit spending will either be wrenched lower or, more likely,funded by printed money. Our status as the world’s leading financial power willbe profoundly shaken.39 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber259]Short of major entitlement reform, it is difficult to find a benevolent outcometo this clash between social spending and savings in this country. The answer,whenever it comes, will surely be political. The Great Depression of the 1930sbrought us Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The economic “malaise” of the late 1970sand the financial distress that followed brought us Ronald Reagan and MargaretThatcher.BOX 9.4: MONEY ISN’T EVERYTHINGBudget appropriations provide money but not real resources to fund futurebenefits. There is no limit on the size of appropriations to fund ongoing or newsocial benefits. The fact that both houses of the Congress vote overwhelminglyfor a new benefit, and the president eagerly signs the bill, does nothing toensure that resources (people and products) will be available to fulfill theobligation. A continued decline in net domestic savings will shortly implyeither a halt in the growth in our net fixed assets or increased funding fromforeign savings. Net fixed assets, of course, are a major contributor to gainsin productivity that, in turn, produce our standard of living, including theability to meet the real resources requirements of our promises to retirees.We would do well to heed the caution offered in 1976 by former British primeminister Margaret Thatcher that politicians who are in the forefront offostering large continual social financial transfers “always run out of otherpeople’s money.”40 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber260]Medicare, Social Security, and all other indexed programs are real entitlementswhose funding burdens cannot be assuaged by general inflation. To implementMedicare and Medicaid in the decade ahead, we will need more physicians,41[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber261] nurses, hospitals,pharmaceutical companies, and other components of the large complex of medicalservices infrastructure. Making the problem all the more difficult, asignificant number of experienced medical practitioners will be part of the waveof baby-boomer retirees in the years ahead. Social Security benefits, indexed toinflation, represent a general claim on the production of consumer goods andservices. But in the end, they are just as real as the more specializedresources required to meet medical entitlements.STATISTICAL APPENDIX 9.1The relative stability of the sum of social benefits and gross domestic savingsimplies a near one-to-one tradeoff between benefits and savings. The probabilitythat the relationship is purely accidental or owing to chance is exceptionallysmall. The R2 is a robust .75 and the t-statistic is highly significant (Exhibit9.10 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_9_10]). The short-term visualtradeoff depicted in Exhibit 9.7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_9_7] appears even more persuasivethan the formal regression fit.The hypothetical additional gross domestic savings that would have occurred in2011 had benefits spending remained at 4.7 percent of GDP (its 1965 share) isnearly $1.6 trillion. Adding those lost savings to the actual amount of grossdomestic savings in 2011, and then further adding savings borrowed from abroad($467 billion in 2011), yields a hypothetical estimate for gross domesticinvestment $1.6 trillion higher than what actually occurred. Of total grossdomestic investment, private domestic business has accounted for a relativelystable three fifths of total gross domestic investment. That yields ahypothetical addition to gross domestic private business investment in 2011 of$975 billion. I then adjust the hypothetical gross private nonfarm businessinvestment into net investment by setting aside a proportion of gross investmentto account for depreciation—that is, the wear and tear on the stock of capitalassets. Finally, I deflate the hypothetical net investment figures into constantdollars.That enables me to employ the BLS’s multifactor productivity (MFP) paradigm (seeChapter 8 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-13.xhtml]) to translate labor input andthe hypothetical real net domestic private business investment (converted to“capital services”) into hypothetical real gross domestic private nonfarmbusiness product and output per hour.42[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber262]"},{"pageContent":"TENCULTUREIt was the clear but frosty evening of February 8, 1998, outside the tower ofthe Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland. Inside, thetightly knit, collegial group of governors of eleven1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber263] of the world’s largestcentral banks was engaged in one of our regular Sunday dinners, hosted by thegeneral manager of the BIS. The meetings were without staff and engaginglyuninhibited as we discussed the usual array of pressing international economicissues. Given that eight of the eleven governors were European, the issue of theemergence of what came to be known as the euro was a topic of increasinginterest.The BIS seemed a singularly appropriate place to ponder the awesome complexitiesof a merging of the seventeen separate currencies that eventually constitutedthe “Eurozone.” There was an explicit recognition among many of the Europeancentral bankers that the euro was the next stepping stone toward the politicalintegration of Europe. It was the ultimate goal of some, if not most, of theEuropeans sitting around the dinner table that evening. Seared into the Europeanpsyche was the devastation of two world wars in less than a third of a century;integration, it was presumed, would go a long way toward fending off futureinternecine conflict.The conversations in Basel were generally directed at replicating a currency aseffective as the U.S. dollar that served as legal tender across all fiftyAmerican states. From the beginning it was recognized that the merging ofcurrencies of the European states could not be directly modeled after U.S.practice. There were more languages, less labor mobility, and less free capitalflow throughout the continent than existed across the state boundaries of theUnited States. But there was an unwavering conviction that economic and culturalbarriers would break down under the imperative of a single currency.2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber264]Most important, the international financial markets appeared to be buying thehypothesis that the euro could change some deeply embedded cultural behavior.The presumption was that all members of the Eurozone, but especially theItalians, Spaniards, Portuguese, and Greeks, once under the cover of thediscipline of the euro, would behave like Germans. In anticipation of theadoption of the new currency, yields on government debt of the prospectivemembers of the Eurozone had been falling sharply in the years prior to our BISdinner, dramatically closing the yield spread gap against the German bund. Inthe three years leading up to the introduction of the euro on January 1, 1999,yields on lira-denominated ten-year government bonds declined nearly 500 basispoints (5 percentage points) relative to yields on German bunds. Yields onSpanish peso and Portuguese escudo bonds both fell close to 370 basis pointsagainst the bunds. Likewise, in the three years preceding Greece’s delayedadoption of the euro on January 1, 2001, drachma-denominated ten-year sovereignbonds fell more than 450 basis points relative to bund yields. In starkcontrast, in those early years, spread changes against the bund for bonds ofFrance, Austria, Netherlands, and Belgium were all less than 65 basis points.3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber265]It was puzzling that the convergence of borrowing rates and correspondingdramatic narrowing of spreads was reflected entirely in the decline of southernEuropean yields toward those of Germany rather than toward an average of allEurozone legacy currencies, as might have been expected. That underscored thedominant role of the deutschmark (DM) as the shadow anchor of newly mintedeuros: Markets perceived the euro as a substitute for the DM. In retrospect, thedominance of Germany did not bode well for the working relationship within thepresumably collegial group of countries.EURO: IN WITHOUT A WHIMPERMuch to my surprise, on January 1, 1999, the merging of the currencies came offwith remarkable ease. The eleven divergent floating currencies (six others wouldjoin later) effortlessly locked together and remained locked with little markettension for almost a decade. The euro seemed to belie the decidedly checkeredhistory of past endeavors to tie exchange rates of culturally diverse countries.Many countries have, for example, succeeded in choosing the U.S. dollar as theirlegal tender. But these, over the years, have primarily been small LatinAmerican and Caribbean economies. And, of course, many currencies have linkedtogether under the gold standard. But in recent decades, success has been rare.The experience of Argentina is especially noteworthy.The central lesson of fixed exchange rates is that when they work, they dominimize price fluctuation and render all the benefits of stability andlong-term investment that attaches to it. The Bretton Woods Agreement, struckamong forty-four countries as World War II was coming to a close, tied all majorpostwar currencies to the gold-backed4[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber266] U.S. dollar for nearlythree decades. The presumption that the euro could easily withstand the internalmonetary dynamics of seventeen clashing cultures, however, now seems a decidedoverreach.In retrospect, the remarkably benign convergence of Eurozone currencies fornearly a decade can be explained, as best I can judge, by the global boom thatfunded both the creditworthy and the less so. It enabled even the increasinglyuncompetitive Euro-South economies (Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Italy) tothrive as they effortlessly borrowed heavily from their northern neighbors atthe low interest rates that the euro accorded them. But hidden beneath the falsesense of well-being, the southern members of the Eurozone were becomingincreasingly uncompetitive relative to their partners in the north, as indicatedby their ever-rising unit labor costs and prices relative to those of Germany(see Exhibit 10.1 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-15.xhtml#exhibit_10_1]).With the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, followed by the virtualclosing down of trade credit on a global scale, recognition of the starklydifferent international competitive capabilities of Eurozone members emergedwith a vengeance after nearly a decade of golden years for the new currency.Fears of sovereign default escalated and southern euro government bond spreadsagainst Germany blew out, after years of Euro-South being able to borrow ininternational markets at market rates very close to those of Germany. Spreads bylate 2008 ballooned back to where they were, in general, before the euro wasconsidered a realistic possibility.CULTURE REIGNSThere had been a widespread notion that the Italians, once they embraced theeuro, would behave like Germans. From day one of the euro, they did not. Nor didthe Greek, Portuguese, or Spanish members of the European Monetary Union.5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber267] Despite the bindingrestraints of the Maastricht Treaty, the Eurozone has not exhibited the abilityto counter the key concern of currency unions: that the value created by apooling arrangement tends in the end to be distributed disproportionately infavor of the financially less collegial and less prudent members of the pool. Weobserved this tendency as consumption growth of the south relative to Germanyaccelerated following the creation of the euro. Unless restrained, the lesscollegial members of the pool will try, and often succeed, to exploit theadvantage available to all members of a pool—that which Greece in particular sobrazenly exploited over the past decade.I believe Kieran Kelly, an Australian financial adviser, captured the Greekethos best as he noted in October 2011 that “if I lived in a country like this,I would find it hard to stir myself into a Germanic tax-paying life of capitalaccumulation and arduous labor. The surrounds just aren’t conducive.”6[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber268]As can be seen from Exhibit 10.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-15.xhtml#exhibit_10_1], the unit labor costs, drivenby workers’ wage demands, of the countries that make up Euro-South rosepersistently from the onset of the euro. In fact, from 1985 to the beginning of1999, the legacy currencies, calculated in terms of deutschmarks, the hardcurrency that the creators of the euro seek to replicate, exhibitedapproximately the same rate of competitive erosion that was evident in unitlabor costs in the years immediately following the adoption of the euro. Priorto the launch of the new currency, the Mediterranean nations were able to remaininternationally competitive by allowing their currencies to weaken. That had theeffect of reducing real wages and unit labor costs to internationallycompetitive levels, at least for a short while. No special cross-borderfinancing was required.7554.jpg [../Images/7554.jpg]ENTER THE EUROBut with devaluation no longer available after 1998, and the apparentlyirresistible availability of credit at the low euro interest rates, Euro-South’sconsumption surged, especially in Greece and Spain. They borrowed heavily fromEuro-North. The size of the buildup is best represented by the €750 billion ofaccumulated credits in the Eurozone central bank clearing system (TARGET2) ofthe Deutsche Bundesbank by August 2012, and to a lesser extent the credits ofthe central banks of Netherlands, Finland, and tiny Luxembourg.7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber269] Southern Europe’ssovereign bond spreads widened back to the levels that prevailed during thefinancially independent pre-euro years. The central banks of Euro-South,especially Italy and Spain, were the major net debtors of TARGET2.8[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber270] Since mid-2012, theTARGET2 spread has narrowed modestly.There is thus scant evidence that on embracing the euro, Euro-Southsignificantly altered its behavior—behavior which had previously precipitatedits chronically depreciating exchange rates against the deutschmark. From 1985through the end of 1998, Euro-South unit labor costs and prices rose far fasterthan in the north, and in the years following the onset of a single currency, asI noted, that pace barely slowed. By 2008, according to OECD data, Greece,Spain, Italy, and Portugal had unit labor costs 30 percent to 40 percent higherthan that of Germany.9 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber271]The underlying uptrend was stopped only by the financial crisis. Productivity inGermany, after having grown at a steady rate between 1999 and 2008, flattenedand has been stagnant since the onset of the crisis. Hourly wages, however,continued their upward, fairly consistent average growth of 2.1 percent peryear. The consequence, of course, has been a rise in German unit labor costssince 2008. Moving dramatically in the opposite direction were the unit laborcosts of Ireland, Portugal, and Spain, which substantially improved theircompetitive positions relative to Germany. The unit labor costs of the othermajor members of the Eurozone relative to Germany since the crisis have largelymaintained the ranking they exhibited through the decade prior.Euro-North has been historically characterized by high savings rates,10[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber272] low inflation, andadherence to the rule of law (the latter can be proxied by the share of illegalactivity in GDP). These are some of the metrics of a culture that determine theshare of national income that is spent and the share that is saved to financecapital investment. In contrast, negative saving rates—excess consumption—havebeen a common feature of Greece and Portugal since 2003.There remains the question, as this book went to press, of whether most, or all,of the south could or would ever voluntarily adopt northern prudence. A breakupof the Eurozone could leave in its wake a number of northern European countrieswith similar economic cultures—Germany, France,11[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber273] Netherlands, Austria,Luxembourg, and Finland, for example—still devoted to preserving a narrowed butviable Eurozone. In the end, however, a euro breakup may be perceived as toowrenching to the economic structure of Europe.SECOND THOUGHTSMany members of Euro-North may be harboring second thoughts about joining theEurozone, but once there, the process of unscrambling the eggs of finance may betoo daunting to contemplate. Pending further structural changes, the EuropeanCentral Bank (ECB) has effectively thrown off all of the Maastricht Treatyrestrictions that bound the bank to the model of the Deutsche Bundesbank. Aftera whole series of actions gradually loosening its Maastricht reins, the ECBemployed its ultimate weapon in the fight to preserve the euro—theinnocuous-sounding Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) facility. The creationof that facility fulfilled the vow of Mario Draghi, the able and crediblepresident of the ECB: “Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever ittakes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough.”12[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber274] It offered virtuallyunlimited access to central bank credit, a maneuver reminiscent of when banksallegedly stopped runs on their institutions literally by exposing theircurrency reserves in their windows for all to see. At this writing, no actuallending has been made against the OMT facility. Interest rates on sovereignten-year notes of Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Italy nevertheless felldramatically.13 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber275] But thedeep-seated tensions of the Eurozone remain.It may be that nothing short of a politically united Eurozone (or Europe) willbe seen as the sole way to embrace the valued single currency. I do not find afiscal union of seventeen welfare states easily sustainable, except as a waystation to full political union. A welfare state without control of its budgetis a nonstarter.There is even some question of the viability of a political union with seriouslydivergent cultures. Germany has not fully economically consolidated East Germanyinto the Federal Republic. Adjusting from East Germany’s communist state to themarket competition of the West has not proved as easy as most Germans at thepoint of consolidation (1990) thought likely. And a meaningful consolidationbetween Germany and, say, Greece is something else entirely.ADDRESSING FUNDAMENTALSSince the onset of the actual crisis in the Eurozone, a particularly distressingissue has been the unwillingness or inability of the nations of Euro-South toaddress their seemingly intractable budget deficits—the source of the ongoingcrisis. A breakup of the Eurozone could create massive deficits and contagion.Moreover, the fear of a euro breakup for those currently heavily subsidizedeconomies is real. No less real is the fear of a breakup to Germany, whoseexports are denominated in euros, and whose global exchange rate is far lowerthan the rate German exporters would confront were they to export under thedeutschmark currency regime.14[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber276] Germany would suffergreater unemployment, a sensitive issue for today’s narrowly divided Germanelectorate.Thus, when confronted with the chronic euro crisis, Euro-North has been inclinedto continue bailouts, all coming directly or indirectly from central bank (ECB)money. After thirteen months and well over a €1 trillion expansion of lending toeuro banks, essentially to indirectly fund the fiscal deficits of Euro-Southcountries, panic subsided.*[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-6_fn1.xhtml#footnote-1443-6] This policy has beenmost apparent since May 2011 as European financial authorities turned to the ECBto print money to fund the persistent fiscal deficits throughout the southernEurozone (Exhibit 10.2 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_10_2]).Confronted with a choice of ending deficit spending or funding it, Eurozonepolicy makers invariably chose the latter as the more politically attractivealternative. Such actions did, of course, resolve short-term funding crises butdid little to address fundamental deficits. If the ECB—the sole source ofsovereign credit in the Eurozone—will do “whatever it takes” to preserve theeuro, I must assume that, if necessary, the OMT facility or any future lendingvehicle will lend virtually without conditions. Between June 2011 and June 2012,assets of the ECB ballooned by more than half to €3.1 trillion.15[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber277] Such funding is, ofcourse, in addition to the more limited direct taxpayer funding predominantlyfrom Germany. Since mid-2011, confronted with pain-generating budgets cuts, orthe ability to ostensibly fund them solely with a stroke of a pen, the choice atevery point in the euro crisis has been to temporarily fund the deficit to givepolicy makers more time to, presumably, address the fiscal imbalances, theultimate source of the crisis.The propensity of policy makers to seek the least politically painful solutionto a problem is, of course, not the monopoly of Europeans. We see it everywhere.As I note in Chapter 7 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-12.xhtml], when confrontedwith the choice of solving an economic problem, policy makers most everywherehave clearly been tilting toward “painless” short-term actions rather thaneffective long-term solutions at a cost of short-term pain.A BROADER PERSPECTIVEThe sorry travail of the euro at the turn of this century is only the latestevidence of the profoundly important role that culture plays in economicaffairs. The key lesson of recent history is that while cultures do change overthe decades and centuries, at best they do so only gradually. As the shorthistory of the euro appears to demonstrate, culture has been far lesssusceptible to change than the financial markets had previously assumed. As Ihave noted, the markets anticipated that Spain and Italy in particular, uponadopting the euro in 1999, would alter their cultures and become more likeprudent Germany.16 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber278] Aftera near decade of seeming validation, however, that presumption failed under thepressure of the 2008 crisis, and the ECB had to scramble to the euro’s rescue.However, governments continue to struggle with austerity fatigue. Spending cutsare fomenting strikes and protests, which so far have been contained, but Europeis far from out of the woods.CULTURE DEFINEDBy culture, I mean the shared values of members of a society that are inculcatedat an early age and that pervade all aspects of living. Culture is particularlyrelevant in shaping the type of economic system we choose to construct in thepursuit of material goods and services. It shapes a large body of intuitive andhabitual responses to the daily challenges of life. Its embraced rules ofbehavior enable much of life’s complex daily decision-making processes to becarried out on autopilot, thereby removing a significant amount of the unwantedtension in our lives. It can be all encompassing, as it is in many religions,and it is rarely merely peripheral.Aside from the compelling evidence of the history of the euro, examples of therole of economic culture are all around us. I recall a conversation I had in2000 with Kiichi Miyazawa, the then-finance minister of Japan. I told him Ithought Japan could recover more quickly from the sluggish aftermath that besetits economy following the stock market crash of 1990 by liquidating dodgy loans.Their banks had a policy of loan forbearance—that is, their banks were reluctantto call loans (especially on defaulting real estate) and liquidate thecollateral, the standard procedure of most Western banks. Miyazawa respondedthat such provoking actions were not the “Japanese way.” Calling a loan, andpropelling borrowers into bankruptcy in certain circumstances, would cause themto lose “face.” The Japanese just did not behave that way, he informed me.“Face” is a profoundly important aspect of Japanese culture.The depth of that culture was also on display a decade later in the wake of thetsunami of 2011 that crippled Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant. Kiyoshi Kurokawa,chairman of the Japanese Diet’s Nuclear Accident Independent InvestigationCommission, asserted that the crisis was the result of “ingrained conventions ofJapanese culture . . . our reflexive obedience; our reluctance to questionauthority; . . . our groupism; and our insularity. . . . Had other Japanese beenin the shoes of those who bear responsibility for this accident, the result[might] well have been the same.”17[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber279]A specific brand of culture—populism—has been particularly debilitating toeconomic progress. In The Age of Turbulence, I noted that economic populists areclear about their grievances but are unable to offer credible ways to addressthem. Capitalism and socialism are specific about the conditions they deemnecessary for the creation of wealth and rising standards of living. Populism isnot. It is a shout of pain.Many twenty-first century Latin Americans, in my experience, continue to railagainst the United States. Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez in particular workedassiduously to his dying day to fan anti-American feelings. But cultures canchange, albeit slowly. Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Peru have had multipleepisodes of failed populist policies since the end of World War II, but thoseformerly populist-driven economies have since successfully adopted moremarket-sensible policies, and with some backing and filling, have managed toimplement significant noninflationary growth in recent years.The experience of postwar Argentina, on the other hand, has been more sobering.A succession of failed economic programs and periods hobbled by inflationcreated economic instability. By 1991, the situation had become so desperatethat the then-newly elected president, Carlos Menem, turned to Domingo Cavallo,his knowledgeable finance minister, for guidance. With his president’s backing,Cavallo linked the Argentine peso one to one to the American dollar. This was anextremely risky strategy and could have blown apart within hours ofimplementation. But the boldness of the move and the seeming credibility of thecommitment impressed world financial markets. Argentine interest rates droppedsharply, and inflation fell from almost 20,000 percent year over year in March1990 to a single-digit annual inflation rate by late 1991. I was amazed andhopeful.Gradually but inexorably, however, the buffer of dollar-borrowing capacity wasdrawn down as deeply rooted populist policies reemerged. The central bank ofArgentina, in a losing effort to support the peso-dollar parity, borroweddollars from abroad to sell for pesos. The bottom of the barrel was reached atthe end of 2001. Protecting its remaining reserve of dollars, the central bankwithdrew its one-for-one offer of dollars for pesos in international markets. OnJanuary 7, 2002, the peso collapsed with mounting disruption to employment andArgentine standards of living. By mid-2002, it took more than three pesos to buyone dollar. A massive default of Argentine debt induced an initial period ofsoaring inflation and interest rates. But much to my surprise, financial calmwas restored relatively quickly. The sharp decline in the peso had spurredexport sales and economic activity.What I found memorable about this episode was not that Argentine leaders in 2001were unable to marshal the fiscal and monetary restraint required to hold thepeso-dollar link, but that they had been able for a while to persuade theirpopulation to maintain the degree of restraint that a pegged peso required. Itwas clearly a policy aimed at inducing a seminal shift in cultural values thatwould restore the international stature that Argentina had enjoyed in the yearsimmediately preceding World War I. But cultural inertia proved, as it had manytimes before, too formidable a barrier. The aftermath of that episode plaguesArgentinean economic policy to this day.7770.jpg [../Images/7770.jpg]THE METRICS OF CULTUREAs I note in Chapter 8 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-13.xhtml], for thoseeconomies that seek maximum economic growth, it appears that abstinence andprudence are necessary (though not sufficient) virtues for prosperity. Unlesspart of productive effort is diverted from immediate consumption and directedtoward creating capital “tools,” continually rising standards of living are notachievable. From an economist’s perspective, this may be one of the mostimportant choices of democratic societies. How long and to what extent can apopulation abstain from immediate consumption?18[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber280] And indeed, theconsequences of those choices most recently were reflected in the ranking of thesavings rates across the Eurozone. I wasn’t surprised to find “spendthrift”Greece at one end of the savings array and “austere” Austria on the other.The relationship between savings and economic performance, however, is morenuanced. The United States, for example, has by far the highest output per hourand per capita GDP among the world’s major developed countries, yet its savingsrate over the past forty years has averaged close to that of Portugal. Moreover,China, on the other hand, has a 50 percent savings rate, but much of what issaved is wasted in funding empty high-rise office buildings and pet projects ofimportant provincial leaders that do not foster long-term growth. The complexityof the tie of savings to economic growth is best illustrated by Exhibit 10.3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-15.xhtml#exhibit_10_3]. In the upper section of thescatter diagram lie all of the major “advanced economies” as classified by theInternational Monetary Fund. The relationship between their gross nationalsavings rates19 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber281] and realper capita GDP (at purchasing power parity) is statistically significant.20[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber282] The lower segment, theemerging economies who are members of the G-20, exhibit no statisticallysignificant relationship between per capita GDP and the country’s savings rates.It is only when we bring finance into the equation that ties between prudenceand standards of living become evident. As I noted in Chapter 5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-10.xhtml], the purpose of financial intermediationis to facilitate the investment of savings, both domestic and borrowed, intohigh-rate-of-return cutting-edge technologies. The U.S. financial system,despite its periodic breakdowns, has proved historically to be a very efficienteconomic vehicle to maximize the use of what we put aside to fund ourunparalleled productive infrastructure to produce goods and services. Generally,the major developing countries shown in Exhibit 10.3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-15.xhtml#exhibit_10_3] with a savings rate similarto those in the developed world have per capita GDP only a third to a half aslarge as developed world nations.21[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber283]INNOVATIONBut beyond prudence and savings, culture also plays a critical role in capitalinvestment. The United States, for example, has historically had a culture ofentrepreneurial risk taking that engenders innovation and has maximized theefficient use of our scarce savings to convert innovation into appliedtechnology. The result is highly productive capital assets. China, on the otherhand, despite its lurch toward capitalism, has an authoritarian system that inpractice discourages ideas not in line with “politically correct” thinking,meaning the views of Chinese political leaders. As I said earlier, innovationis, by definition, outside of conventional thinking and is therefore a potentialthreat to political control by the Communist Party. As previously noted,according to a 2011 Thomson Reuters survey of the world’s one hundred mostinnovative companies, forty were U.S. based while none were Chinese. Saving isthus a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for high per capita GDP.Innovative (thinking outside the box) entrepreneurship and prudence are largely,if not wholly, culturally driven traits. Placing hard numbers on suchqualitative notions as the protection of property rights and the freedom oflabor to organize is difficult terrain for economists. There is inevitably adegree of subjective judgment in such calculations. Nonetheless, the World Bankseems to have credibly surmounted this conceptual barrier and produced a usefulparadigm to convert the qualitative to the numerical. As can be seen in Exhibit10.4 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-15.xhtml#exhibit_10_4a], various aspects ofculture are successfully tied to per capita real GDP. On each scatter plot, Iinclude what the World Bank is trying to capture statistically.22[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber284] In all cases,correlations are between .79 and .81, a remarkably high statistical relationshipfor qualitative associations such as these. An even tighter correlation existsfor the advanced countries, and a very modest one for the emerging countries ofthe G-20. The World Economic Forum created a Global Competitive Index,23[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber285] which in 2012 was highlycorrelated with per capita GDP (see Exhibit 10.5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_10_5]). The United States, despitesome slippage in recent years, remains first among the large developed countriesin competitiveness.7833.jpg [../Images/7833.jpg]7874.jpg [../Images/7874.jpg]7884.jpg [../Images/7884.jpg]CONSENSUSWhile it is rare that a nation has a set of cultural mores embraced withoutexception by the entire population, there is a visible tendency for much of asociety to coalesce around a shared point of view, which can, and often does,differ measurably from the choices of other societies. A functioning society ornation must have some fundamental values held by almost all residents, or itwould be in a state of constant internal conflict, if not outright civilwarfare. Some organizations have written codes for dress and behavior, such asthe military, but many do not.At a broader national level, we in the United States have the Bill of Rights ofour Constitution, which, since our founding, has garnered the virtuallyunanimous support of our population. Almost every nation has some formalconstitution governing the relationship between the state and citizenry,including a set of rules of required behavior. Some nations have no formalwritten constitution—Great Britain, for example. And then there areconstitutions that have little to do with the way a country is governed—thedefunct Soviet Union, for example.SOCIETAL COMMUNICATIONA society requires a means of facilitating communication among members. A commonlanguage is important but not essential (for example, Switzerland and Canada).One rarely discussed aspect of the process of communication in a society is thevalue not just of a common language but of a similar accent to convey a sense ofcommunity and foster a sense of comfort. It enhances the extent that herdbehavior hones the conveyance of common values throughout a society, thusfacilitating the merging of views on, and the formulation of, public policy.In my teenage days as a musician, I traveled around the United Statesextensively. One particular incident from that period tells me a great dealabout the extent to which America’s culture has changed in the last sevendecades. I was on a train from Birmingham to Atlanta, and I happened to findmyself seated next to a young southern woman with whom I conversed for the nextcouple of hours. I can truthfully say that I didn’t understand half of what shewas saying, and I am sure she had the same difficulty with my New York accent. Iknew she was speaking English, but it sounded as if she was speaking in aforeign tongue.I am fascinated by the extent in this country to which such geographicaldifferences in accents and dialects have diminished. I remember as a youngsterlistening to a fairly well-known radio program during which a linguist wouldinterview people at random from the audience and identify, not only from whichpart of the country the individual originated, but also, with a high degree ofaccuracy, often the county as well. I doubt very much that such a capabilityexists today. First, the talking movies that emerged in 1927 (The Jazz Singer)and the advent of nationwide radio about the same time began to compress thedifferences in accents, but it was television that greatly accelerated theprocess. Our tendency to mimic each other has helped merge dialects essentiallyinto an American one in which regional differences are now modest, and stillcontracting.POLITICSOur political institutions mirror our cultural mores. Beyond the shared valuesimplicit in our Constitution, we have always had wide-ranging differences aboutour political priorities. The size of the differences is readily seen in thepolitical mapping of the Congress. In Exhibit 10.6[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_10_6], I chart the politicalleanings of the 112th Congress from “very liberal” to “very conservative” (basedon their voting records), thanks to data collected by VoteView.com. There arevery few “moderates” in this profile. The schism is particularly pronounced inthe House of Representatives, where a significant part of the Republicanmajority reflects the ethos of the Tea Party, which exhibits a faint echo of thepredominant culture of the nineteenth century—rugged individualism andself-reliance. The Democrats’ roots lie with Roosevelt’s New Deal.The distribution of the four separate caucuses—Democrats and Republicans of boththe Senate and the House—have always portrayed patterns similar to those of thecurrent Congress, going back at least to the dawn of the twentieth century. See,for example, the caucus distribution of the 56th Congress (1899 to 1901)(Exhibit 10.7 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_10_7]).Today’s political climate, however, seems different from much of Americanhistory in that, in earlier generations, members of Congress had majordifferences (as they do today), but they were willing “to reach across theaisle” to find common solutions. Such collegiality even spilled over into theWhite House. I well remember when President Ford and Speaker Thomas P. “Tip”O’Neill would argue vehemently with each other from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., but at 6p.m., Tip would stop by the West Wing to join his old House buddy Jerry fordrinks. The work of government got done.But while the Senate and House caucuses have always reflected deep differencesbetween Republicans and Democrats, this does not appear to be the profile of theelectorate. Surveys indicate a large bunching in the middle.*[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-6_fn1.xhtml#footnote-1443-7] This seeming anomalymay reflect the severe geographical concentration of Democrats on the heavilypopulated East and West coasts of the country, with Republicans dominant in themountain and southern states. I discuss the implication of such trends inChapter 14 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-19.xhtml]."},{"pageContent":"ELEVENTHE ONSET OF GLOBALIZATION, INCOME INEQUALITY, AND THE RISE OF THE GINI AND THECRONYThe generation of Americans who fought and won World War II took the lead increating our global economic structure tied to the U.S. dollar, and propelledthe United States to its unrivaled status among world economic powers. They werefamously labeled by Tom Brokaw our “Greatest Generation.” “They succeeded onevery front . . . [and] saved the world. . . .

But starting in the 1960s, America turned its benevolence and wealth tothe home front, significantly expanding social benefit programs to assist thosewho had lagged in participating in America’s postwar affluence. The civil rightsmovement that took hold in the 1950s was instrumental in altering America’sdomestic priorities.Despite the onset of rapidly growing government social benefit outlays, incomeinequality began its inexorable postwar rise by the early 1970s (Exhibit 11.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_11_1]).3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber288] Inequality of both incomeand wealth in recent years has risen to a level that has opened up largecrevices in America’s political system. Political comity has fallen to itslowest level since before World War II.INCOME INEQUALITY: THE RISE OF THE GINIThe U.S. economy, which was subject to rigid economic control by governmentthroughout World War II, quickly demobilized and became sufficiently flexible toemerge after the war with a degree of income inequality that remained modest foryears. The Gini coefficient—named for Italian statistician and demographerCorrado Gini—a measure of income inequality that ranges between zero and one,that is, from none to total, was about .38 for family incomes shortly after thewar and drifted lower until the late 1960s.*[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-6_fn1.xhtml#footnote-1443-8]The economy that emerged from the war was heavily industrialized. Manufacturing,the high-tech and high-paying industry of its day, accounted for 28 percent ofGDP in 1953. Finance and insurance, the source of many of today’s high-incomerecipients, accounted for only 2 percent. By 2011, manufacturing’s share of GDPhad slipped to 11 percent, while finance and insurance had climbed to 8 percent.The skills required to operate our capital facilities were readily taught inAmerican high schools and almost a third of our workforce coming out of the warhad high school diplomas. In addition, extensive technical training of ourmilitary during the war and the educational benefits of the GI Bill4[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber289] following the waraugmented the skill mix of our postwar labor force. Those veterans were fullycapable of operating complex manufacturing assembly lines and our economicinfrastructure in general. The level of output per hour from 1946 to 1973 roseat a vigorous annual pace of 2.7 percent. Real wages rose with it. Americanbusiness, confronted with a huge hunger for consumer goods immediately after thewar, had to produce all out. Strikes that shut down output were very costly andlargely avoided by companies meeting most of labor’s demands for wages andbenefits.5 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber290] Foreignproduction facilities had been decimated by the war and hence import competitionfor U.S. manufacturers was rare. Labor unions flourished in such a benignenvironment for collective bargaining, as companies were able to raise pricesand accommodate unions’ demands.THE GOLDEN AGEMost factory and other skilled workers’ income rose to levels that enabled themto buy a home and raise a family.6[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber291] I recall visiting anumber of friends back from the war who settled in Levittown on Long Island, atypical example of the new suburban communities that appeared to rise virtuallyovernight throughout postwar America. The emergence of the Cold War and threatsof nuclear annihilation were real, but they couldn’t erase the state of prideand euphoria stemming from America’s world hegemony. We had nearly half of theworld’s GDP and an unlimited future. In these early postwar years (1946 to1970), income inequality was essentially flat (see Exhibit 11.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_11_1]). That implied a stable ratioof wages earned in essentially repetitive jobs on an assembly line to those ofcognitive occupations. Automation had just begun.In the years that followed, we experienced the gradual displacement ofrepetitive jobs by competitive low-labor-cost foreign producers, especiallyChina and East Asia, and increasingly sophisticated robots.7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber292] The consequent increasedinequality was most apparent in hollowed-out middle class incomes. The Ginicoefficient turned upward in the 1970s and continued its upward climb for thenext thirty-five years. The causes were numerous and interrelated.GLOBALIZATIONAmong the most important was globalization in its many manifestations. As therest of the world recovered, imports of goods and services into the UnitedStates exerted ever-increasing pressure on middle income American jobs,particularly union jobs. The share of our private sector workforce belonging tounions declined, from around 35 percent in the 1950s to 7 percent in 2012.Strikes or threats of strike—labor’s most formidable tool of the 1950s—rapidlydiminished. In 2012, the number of workers on strike was less than one tenth ofthe average number that “hit the bricks” throughout the 1950s. Union wagepremiums over nonunion wages, as a consequence, have virtually disappeared inrecent decades.8 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber293] The Ginicoefficient’s dramatic rise starting in the 1970s reflected in part thediminishing clout of labor unions.But while China’s gradual displacement of American jobs grabbed the headlines,an increasing number of “superearners” burst onto the international scene,adding upward pressure to the Gini coefficient. This trend was best illustratedby the Beatles’ emergence in the 1960s. The four mop-haired youngsters made amodest living in Liverpool, England. But it was only when they exploded on theglobal scene and were able to tap a vast international market for recordings andperformances before large audiences that their incomes soared. Were it not forthe global transportation and distribution at their disposal, they would havespent their careers in relative anonymity in Liverpool. Most important, however,was that the Beatles were not unique. They were joined at the top of the incomedistribution by prominent sports figures and other entertainment personalities.Without jet aircraft, these income outliers would have numbered far less.EDUCATION’S GINIGlobalization’s superearner trend is even threatening to reach down to the areaof our labor force least prone to income inequality—education. Teaching has beenlocal and lecture audiences small. Salaries have reflected the economics of oneon one or, at most, one on several hundred. But that is about to change.Superprofessors at some of our major universities have already gone online,reaching many thousands at a time. It is about to become a teaching world quitedifferent from being bottled up in local classrooms. It may take awhile beforesuch free lectures become sources of revenue for universities, with eventuallymuch of that money ending up as incomes of the superprofessors, which wouldaccordingly move up education’s Gini.STOCK PRICE DOMINATESBut outranking globalization and the superearners in importance as drivers ofinequality has been the growth of stock price‒influenced incomes. Portfoliomanagement and investment banking vie for the top-paying industries according todata from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). As can be seen in Exhibit 11.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_11_1], the correlation between theGini coefficient and the ratio of the S&P 500 stock price index to the averagehourly earnings of production workers is, unsurprisingly, quite significant asstock price gains have greatly outdistanced the rise in production worker wages,matching the pattern of the Gini coefficient. But what has invited the attentionof headline writers in recent years is the extraordinary rise in chief executiveofficer (CEO) compensation, especially when compared with average productionworker wage.9 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber294], 10[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber295] The rise in the ratio ofstock prices to average nonexecutive wages over the past half century isreflected in the declining share of gross domestic income earned by nonexecutiveworkers compared with the share of those whose income relates importantly tocapital income—dividends, interest, rent, stock option grants, and capital gains(although the last is not included in the calculation of the Gini coefficient).Compensation data clearly show that the value of a CEO’s total compensationpackage is closely tied to the aggregate market value of the firm.11[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber296]Having served on fifteen boards in the quarter century prior to joining the Fed,often on the boards’ compensation committees, I observed firsthand how thesystem worked. “Directors who determine executive salaries argue,” I wrote in2007,12 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber297] “that keydecisions by CEOs leverage vast amounts of [a company’s] market value. In globalmarkets, the difference between a right move and an almost right move mightrepresent hundreds of millions of dollars, whereas a generation ago, when theplaying field was much smaller, the difference would have been in the tens ofmillions. Boards reflecting this view feel pressed by competition to seek the‘very best’ CEO, and are obviously willing to pay what it takes to acquire the‘stars.’” I should have added that second-best choices were available at a lowerpackage of compensation, but the reason they are second best is that theiraverage success rate has been a shade lower than the top pick. But given theaggregate market size of the average large firm, the implication of that highersuccess rate, more often than not, readily swamps the pay differential requiredto get top tier talent. I would be remiss if I did not point out that decisionsof boards of directors do not always follow “best practice.” I discuss myexperiences on boards, which were not always pleasant, in The Age of Turbulence(pages 423–36).I have not joined any boards since I left the Federal Reserve, but while itappears that the authoritarian power of CEOs that I observed for a quartercentury (from 1962 to 1987) prior to my Fed tenure has markedly diminished, anincreasing number of major companies are becoming quasi-“government-sponsoredenterprises.” The quality of governance, if anything, has deteriorated as aconsequence. If not reversed, the growth in the quality of our workforce willstart to slow.THE SCHOOLING ECHOAt the end of World War II, the skills conveyed by American educationalinstitutions were extolled throughout the world. Students from all over theglobe prized coming to the United States for an education they believed theycould not get at home. Our university degrees were avidly sought, and indeedthat remains largely true to this day. But our primary and secondary educationsystems have lagged. The 1995 Trends in International Mathematics and ScienceStudy (TIMSS) reported data on the global status of American students that cameas a shock. It and comparable measures of the shortfalls of our K-12 educationsystem prodded changes that, apparently, have improved student performancesomewhat in recent years.But is the echo of deteriorating schooling two decades ago as yet evident in theincome-earning capabilities of those educated in that environment? Now, almostfifteen years later, we would expect some evidence of deteriorating quality ofeducation being exhibited in a slower pace of economic performance, mostspecifically in productivity and its marginal proxy, real incomes. The data,however, exhibit no such trend. The ratios of income for households headed byfifteen- to twenty-four-year-olds to those headed by thirty-five- toforty-four-year-olds and those headed by forty-five- to fifty-four-year-oldsremain stable through 2011. This suggests that education failures may yet turnup in deteriorating performance on the part of our workforce, and I must admitit is hard to imagine otherwise. But the evidence is not yet convincing,suggesting that other areas of economic distortions are at the root of incomeinequality.JOB MARKET IMBALANCE AND THE H-1B SUBSIDYThis, however, does not mean that there is no distortion in the overall laborforce. Many employers report difficulty in hiring the job skills they need, andindeed that concern is mirrored in the ratio of recent job openings to newhires, which in March 2013 was as high as it was in 2007, a period when labormarkets were far tighter and all categories of workers were in short supply.This suggests that the skill structure of the workforce overall does not matchthe needs implied by the complexity of our capital infrastructure, mostspecifically in areas of high-tech industry.One area of economic policy that has received far less attention than it shouldis immigration reform. It is more likely than most policy issues to stabilizeincome inequality by opening up our skilled labor force requirements to thelarge pool of skilled workers abroad who show significant willingness to fill inour gaps in skills and, most important, at a significantly lower pay level. Thebarrier is clearly the H-1B immigration restrictions that protect (andsubsidize) our high-income earners from the pressures of global wagecompetition.As I noted earlier, the share of GDP that accrues to finance and insurance hasmore than tripled since the end of World War II (from 2.4 percent in 1947 to 7.9percent in 2012). These jobs today are among the highest paid in the nation, inpart because they are protected by immigration quotas that restrict entry ofcompetitors who, were they allowed, would press such compensation and the Ginicoefficient lower. Demand for visas for skilled workers (H-1Bs) “has exceededsupply every year since 2003, when,” as the Economist noted, “Congress slashedthe number of visas on offer by two-thirds.” Compounding the problem posed bynumerical limits on employment-based visas and green cards, employers aredisincentivized to pursue skilled foreigners in the first place, owing to alengthy and expensive process required to “show that they have tried and failedto find a suitable American for the post.”13[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber298] It is difficult tooveremphasize the importance of long overdue reform.IN SUMMARYThe degree of income inequality comes down primarily to the battle between assetvalues and the wage levels of the bulk of our workforce. Growing inequality canbe viewed as the outcome of the shares of gross domestic income captured incompetitive markets by labor and capital. In the early years following World WarII, labor was dominant. With the rest of the world barely recovering, importcompetition was rarely seen. The power to strike and shut down a company gavelabor the edge at the bargaining table. The world began to change when the lowlyWest German Volkswagen, a small and inexpensive car, first came to our shores involumes. American car making was heavily concentrated in big powerful cars ofthe time and did not seem to need to worry about small, seemingly niche markets.But an even more telling blow to American global market hegemony was thedevastating 1959 strike that shut down the American steel industry for 116 days.Domestic steel users, previously shunning imported steel products as inferior,were forced to finally try them. Steel buyers, as I recall, were pleasantlysurprised at the quality of the steels that came from abroad to fill the void.It was the beginning of the end of America’s vaunted unrivaled supremacy in thepostwar world steel market. The American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI)switched from being a strong supporter of free trade (the United States was alarge exporter of steel) to a proponent of a “control imports” policy. I sadlyrecall when the AISI approached Townsend-Greenspan to help them in theirlobbying strategy. We declined. We had ten major steel companies as clients atthe time. I saw the handwriting on the wall and began to diversify my company’sclient base.Globalization was mounting, as were our imports. We slipped from producingnearly half the world’s GDP immediately after the war to averaging less than 30percent since 1980. Imports of goods rose from 2.5 percent of GDP in 1947 to14.6 percent in 2012 (Exhibit 11.2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_11_2]). Labor unions’ share of theworkforce began to decline. Strike activity fell off rapidly. The share ofnational income going to corporate profits, after trending downward since thepostwar years, began to trend upward in the early 1980s—and stock pricesfollowed. With that rise came increased income inequality. That trend continueduntil the onset of crisis in 2008. The decidedly probusiness environment before2008 was nurtured by euphoric booms in quick succession between 1993 and 2006.Political opposition to the probusiness environment was muted.What can be done to end and possibly reverse the society-wrenching rise inincome inequality? Having the United States withdraw from global competition isa nonstarter. It would succeed only in reducing the overall level of economicactivity, both here and abroad. It would threaten the status of the dollar asthe still undisputed world reserve currency. Similarly, constraining the secularrise in stock prices and the ratio of capital stock to labor input would have asimilar effect. Taxation of upper income groups is limited. By 2009, accordingto the CBO, already more than 94 percent of individual income tax liabilitieswere levied on the top 20 percent of household income earners, up from 65percent in 1979.SEQUESTERSBut the onset of crisis created a deep schism between Democrats and Republicans,leading to the most recent “fiscal cliffs,” inadvertent sequesters, and ageneral breakdown in necessary legislative cooperation.This breakdown appears to have resulted indirectly from the half century of anear 10 percent annual rate of increase in social benefits under the sanction ofboth major political parties and, since 2001, tax cuts that eliminated thefiscal flexibility that historically had been essential to fund budget solutionsacceptable to all parties.As I noted in Chapter 9 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-14.xhtml], the rise inbenefits has crowded out capital investment at a virtual dollar-for-dollar ratethat, in turn, has significantly lessened our rate of economic growth. Theunintended and ironic consequence has been a suppression of our capacity to fundfuture social programs. In retrospect, I have concluded that had we grown thosebenefit programs in line with the growth of nominal GDP since 1965 (6.8 percentper year), rather than at an actual annual rate of 9.4 percent,14[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber299] we would have advancedsocial welfare goals, albeit more slowly than contemplated, but withoutundermining America’s growth engine, arguably the ultimate source of socialbenefits.TWENTY-TWENTYRetrospection, of course, is always twenty-twenty. As I reminisced in Chapter 9[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-14.xhtml], in the early 1960s fiscal policy wasperceived as too structurally tight, engendering “fiscal drag” that was believedto be limiting economic growth. I do not recall any worries of overdoing thepolicy remedy: tax decreases and spending increases. In fact, federal governmentnet savings remained in surplus between 1959 and 1966. We failed, however, tofully recognize the contractionary effect of benefit programs on gross domesticsavings and, as a consequence, on economic growth.That growth slowdown of the last half century has left us with much less roomfor further expansion of entitlements, especially given the limits to furtherretrenchment in discretionary spending programs. Reversing our current directionis clearly economically feasible. Unless we do so, we will be risking anotherwrenching financial crisis. The size of our fiscal problem is reflected in thedramatic rise in the proportion of spending that has been borrowed in recentyears rather than funded with taxes. That proportion had risen from zero infiscal year 2001 to 45 percent in early 2010, and was a still problematic onefifth in 2013.Even bringing deficits down to a level that only stabilizes the debt-to-GDPratio implies a permanent slowing of spending and/or a major rise in revenuesfrom current levels. Political constituencies have gotten used to not only acertain flow of new benefits but also a continued expansion of existing benefitsas well. Many of those in Congress who are constantly pressing for tax cuts areconfronted with the inconvenient fact of having already sanctioned the benefitsurge that now has to be financed.A TURNAROUNDAs difficult as it may appear, a turnaround of policy of the magnitude requiredhas ample historic precedent. For example, Sweden’s highly praised welfare stateran into a crisis in 1990 and has since initiated a major reversal of course.Government’s share of GDP declined markedly from 1993 to 2012. Sweden broughtits government accounts into balance. Its economy became competitive. They knowthere is still much to be done, but the Economist, following an extensiveanalysis of Sweden’s and other Scandinavian economies’ revival, concluded, “Theworld will be studying the Nordic model for years to come.”15[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber300]The performance of the Scandinavian countries is by no means unique indemonstrating the incredible power of market competition. China, scarcely to becompared with democratic Sweden, nonetheless has demonstrated the remarkableeconomically recuperative powers of deregulating markets and allowingcompetition to flourish. And one cannot but admire the extraordinary tenacity ofMargaret Thatcher, who lifted Britain from its malaise in the 1980s.Regrettably, since 2009, the United States has been moving in the oppositedirection. Our expansionary policy response to the 2008 crisis failed to restoreprecrisis growth for reasons I raised in Chapter 7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-12.xhtml]. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform andConsumer Protection Act enacted July 21, 2010, has created a pall of uncertaintyover financial markets (see Chapter 5 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-10.xhtml]).There is no doubt that the euphoria driving the dot-com and housing bubbles bredmuch fraud, much of which, I suspect, to date, has gone undetected. We willnever be able to fully prevent such wrongdoing. Its malignant roots are toodeeply embedded in our nature.16[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber301] So is our inbred sense ofjustice in seeking to punish wrongdoers. But regulatory punishment of bubblemalfeasance, beyond proven criminal fraud, which of course should be vigorouslyprosecuted, does little to restore our economy to where we would like it to be.Revenge may be soul satisfying, but it is rarely economically productive.COMPETITIONThe fundamental driver of capitalism is competition. The unbroken line ofsuccess of China in recent decades, the so-called Asian Tigers a generationearlier, and West Germany coming out of World War II have all been predominantlythe result of removing impediments to competition. The great contribution of theclassical economists—Adam Smith and his followers—was to show how supply anddemand interact to form a price system that directs resources to the needs mostvalued by consumers. To be sure, the proofs of these economic principles were inthe context of individuals acting in their own long-term self-interest. Nobody,in the late eighteenth century or ever since, has fully believed thatassumption, but nonetheless we conclude that it is close enough to the realworld for these economically novel eighteenth-century paradigms to be credible.ELASTICITYFreedom of entry to markets creates high elasticity of supply (where a smallprice increase induces large increases in supply). High elasticity of supplythwarts monopolies (single sellers).17[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber302] A loss of market power ofindividual sellers enhances the ability of markets to set prices that achievethe mix of production of goods and services most desired by consumers.The theoretical demonstration of competition as the primary driver of capitalismis reinforced by strong empirical evidence. In Chapter 10[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-15.xhtml], I demonstrated the highly statisticallysignificant relationship between competition and the broadest measure ofrelative global economic success, real per capita GDP. Although competitionworks mainly through creating market flexibility, it also depends on aconviction on the part of market competitors that the price and wage outcomes oftransactions that compose “competition” are “fair.”PUBLIC VERSUS PRIVATE SECTOR ELASTICITYIn private organizations, one aspect of creative destruction that we experienceis the painful process of cost cutting necessitated by a squeeze on profitmargins. Companies have no choice. Public institutions, however, not subject tobankruptcy, are less concerned about getting the lowest price or cost than is aprivate institution. Public institutions directly and indirectly have access tosovereign credit and taxpayer funds. The response to price change of a privatebusiness ranges from high to modest. The response of a government, on the otherhand, ranges from modest to none.I observed this process first hand as Federal Reserve banks presented proposals,as required, to the Federal Reserve Board to replace the buildings that hadalmost all gone into operation at the start of the Federal Reserve System in1914. I recall during the recession of 1989 that large numbers of commercialreal estate properties were selling at substantial discounts. But Reserve bankbuilding proposals were invariably for new buildings, despite their far greatercost. New buildings were recommended because Reserve bank buildings werepresumed unique in that they needed an extra large vault in the basement.Virtually all Reserve banks eventually ended up with new, more costly buildings.I often wondered whether the process would have been handled differently in theprivate sector. As diligent as we were at the Federal Reserve about savingtaxpayer money, it is still the case that public budgets are chosen to berestrained, while private budgets are forced to do so by limited availableresources.18 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber303]This is a classic case of inelastic demand and supply creating higher prices. Ichose this example in particular because the people who were making thesedecisions were truly dedicated to keeping costs down. But subliminally they alsoknew that government was different from the private sector, where companies hadto cope with the fact that funds might not be available to fund such projectsunder any circumstances.If the Federal Reserve restricted its demand to new buildings only, prices ofnew buildings would rise relative to old ones. Restricting its choices, publicsector demand for space was more price inelastic than in the private sector,where an institution, if forced by limited funds, might have found a previouslyunexplored alternative in refitting an older building with a vault, employingfewer real resources and increasing the elasticity of supply. In instance afterinstance, in my experience, government programs are far more price inelasticthan comparable cases subject to private market competition. They produce ahigher price and use more resources than would typically be the case in theprivate sector, while at the same time increasing the utility of our capitalstock only modestly compared with the private sector model.THE MARKET ADJUSTMENT PROCESSAre free markets in general capable of adjusting more quickly to economic shocksthan controlled markets? This is not an easy question to answer given thepaucity of useful data, but in my experience, several noteworthy examplessuggest that the answer is yes: 1. The 1973–74 oil shock,19 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber304] when companies forced to the wall reduced demand far more than most analysts expected, especially given the earlier history of inelastic demand for oil with respect to price; 2. A widespread notion in the late 1970s that bringing inflation down was too costly in terms of unemployment, a view that was proved mistaken; 3. Medicare Part D, where drugs turned out under competition proved to be far less costly than previous experiences had indicated, though as some contend, the original cost estimates may have been elevated.Health care, especially under government fee-for-service subsidization, is animportant case in point. Neither supply nor demand for medical services appearsto respond to price change as readily as, say, the demand and supply at ourcorner grocery store. First, ease of entry for medical professionals isencumbered by a long and expensive period of schooling and certification. Hence,the supply of medical professionals does not easily respond to unexpectedincreases in demand. The result is higher prices. Similarly, physicians do notleave medicine very readily as the price of their services falls. In short,supply of medical services is relatively inelastic. The demand for medicalservices is also highly inelastic, conceivably more so than their supply. Whenconfronted with serious illness, medical care is given our highest priority.Where subsidized, as in Medicare, demand is particularly unresponsive to pricebecause it becomes a virtually free good to beneficiaries. Price generally doesnot inhibit individual patients.This tendency is more or less evident in all goods and services whose supply,and especially demand, is affected by government-dependent private businesses.The result is less demand and supply elasticity in markets that governmentsattempt to favor. Government-dependent companies and services are particularlyprone to politically determined entry—subsidies, guarantees, charters, pricesupports, controls, leases on government land, and all such government-sponsoredactions that prevent markets from functioning in a fully flexible manner. Whenmarkets are flexible, monopolies cannot raise prices.Of course, not all government policies promote increases in nonmarket-determineduse of a product or service. Government is, on occasion, on the side ofrestraining market demand—promoting reduction in tobacco usage and innumerabledrugs and foods, for example. But for the most part, government sponsorshippromotes the use of products and services which, in conjunction with choosingpolitical favorites (cronies), engenders inelastic demand and/or supply,artificially raising prices and lowering production, and in the end, reducingstandards of living.CREATIVE DESTRUCTIONThe dark side of capitalism is that wealth20[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber305] is created only whenobsolescent technologies and companies are allowed to fade out and are replaced.There is inevitable pain in this process. Only economic growth, lowunemployment, and new job availability can assuage the economic angst, at leastin part. There is no way to fully eliminate the pain experienced by those whoare the market casualties of creative destruction. If standards of living are torise, productivity must grow. But that requires that the “new” are constantlydisplacing the “old” low-productivity capital assets and the jobs associatedwith them. Government policies that try to limit the pain and stress of economicadjustment by propping up stagnant or failing low-productivity companies againstthe pressures of creative destruction suppress economic growth and, ironically,in the end the jobs that the economically displaced were seeking. In recentyears, too many companies that should have been allowed to fail (andrestructure) or shrink have been propped up by regulation or tax payer–fundedbailouts.It is economic growth that is essential to new job creation. Businesses hire,not out of the goodness of their souls, but because they have no other choice inperiods of economic growth. Economic growth requires economic flexibility toalter a company’s mix of resources. It implies creative destruction. The purposeof competitive excellence is to be a survivor. But if there is a survivor of thebattle of competition, there must also be a casualty. Pain is thus a regrettableby-product of creative destruction and economic progress. Economic growth thatcreates new job openings does assuage the pain of job loss, but only up to apoint. Through much of the twentieth century, we sought ways to contain the painof the capitalist process. The most universally advocated was job retraining forjob losers. In 1992, President Bill Clinton, however, described such governmentinitiatives at the time as a “confusing array of publicly funded trainingprograms.”21 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber306] Regrettably,my experience is that the political issue is not the outcomes of job trainingprograms but whether the politician who advocates them gains electoralpopularity as a result. This is the reason why there have been so many differentoverlapping job training programs on the books that lost their relevance yearsago and should have been discarded. Community colleges appear to be doing a muchbetter job (see The Age of Turbulence, page 402).CAPITALIST “FAIRNESS”Following the Civil War, criticisms of the “fairness” of markets began tosurface when highly subsidized, newly built railroads were able to expand acrossthe Great Plains to the West Coast, leaving the unsubsidized competitors of therailroads (stagecoaches and riverboats) unable to profitably follow them andcompete for farmers’ business west of the Mississippi. It added to the alreadywidespread discontent among those farmers suffering high shipping rates chargedby these railroad monopolies. It was that sentiment that eventually led to theInterstate Commerce Act of 1887, the first federal law in the United States toregulate private industry.22[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber307]By and large, early nineteenth-century markets were dominated by agriculture,whose pricing was largely local and competitive (almost all, of course, east ofthe Mississippi). Government’s role in this process, as I noted in Chapter 6[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-11.xhtml], was largely restricted to enforcingcontracts and, in later years, antitrust and pure food and drug laws. But theworld of virtually wholly free markets changed with the advent of the GreatDepression and the New Deal, especially the National Industrial Recovery Act. Itdictated prices and wages until it was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1935.A slew of regulatory agencies were spawned in those years that exist to this dayand are best known by their acronyms: SEC, FDIC, CCC, NLRB, FHA, FCC, and manyothers.Markets in the United States prior to the Civil War were generally considered“free” and, in the context of the ethos of the time, therefore “fair.” Eventoday, when we shop at a retail store where prices are listed, we can eitherchoose to forgo the purchase or pay the list price. Alternatively we can haggleon the issue of price. But in the end, the transaction is voluntary, and thismatters in a society that believes there are rights to property as well asperson. Indeed, we define a “free market” as a market where the vast majority oftransactions are deemed by both sides of the transaction as voluntary and notsubject to coercion by monopolists or the state. If we do not have enough money,we do not buy. But we do not expect the retailer or any other private individualto supply our needs for free. The principle extends all the way from the cornergrocer to the purchase of homes and industrial companies. Very few considerthese voluntary exchanges to be other than “fair.”23[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber308], 24[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber309]Many agree that free markets do maximize the material values sought byconsumers, but it is a system not of one citizen, one vote but of one dollar,one vote, and hence a value system skewed in favor of the wealthy. In that samesense, it is considered “unfair.” There is probably no system by this reckoningthat is both productive and fair. Capitalism’s inequality of wealth, of course,reflects the variations of economic talent among our populations, and theprevalence of inherited wealth. As I note in Chapter 1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-6.xhtml], the propensity to favor children andrelatives over strangers passes wealth within a family from one generation toanother. Moreover, wealthy individuals concentrate charity on those institutionsthat support the values of the givers.Since its inception in the late eighteenth century, the capitalist system thushas always been considered “unfair” by part of our population. Critics, rangingfrom Karl Marx and William Jennings Bryan in the nineteenth century to the LatinAmerican economic populists of the twentieth century, have always argued that asa consequence of economic power, standards of living are “unevenly” distributed.But none of these critics have proffered a system that, when tried, has producedthe material standards of living that capitalism has produced, even for ourlowest income recipients.LIVING TOGETHEROur current political clash over the extent of the size of our government—thesize of our welfare state—and economic fairness has been brewing at least sincethe New Deal of the 1930s. The roots of the issue of economic fairness, rarelydiscussed outside the halls of academia, date back to the long-simmering debateabout who among the multitude of economic participants in the interconnectedcapitalist production process has valid claims on shares of its output. To thisday, it remains an issue in dispute. The socialist movement that emerged in thenineteenth century, to a greater or lesser extent, held that the output of amarket economy is jointly produced and that the product each individual producescannot be disentangled from the total. In effect, all producers are equallyindispensable to the creation of the whole. The higher incomes received by someindividuals are not theirs by right. Therefore, duly elected government shouldbe the custodian of the national income and the arbiter on how it isdistributed. This was the implicit substance of William Jennings Bryan’s Crossof Gold speech, which riveted the nation in 1896. Karl Marx went further andargued that much of national income was not only unearned but the product of theexploitation of the working class by the capitalist class. Even though Marxismhas been widely rejected as an explanation of the way democratic capitalistsystems work, “fairness” of income distribution continues to be a matter offierce debate.Classical and neoclassical economists argue that in a free competitive market,incomes earned by all participants in the joint effort of production reflecttheir marginal contributions to the output of the net national product. Marketcompetition ensures that their incomes equal their “marginal product” share oftotal output, and are justly theirs. That view largely prevailed in most of thedeveloped world through the nineteenth century and through World War I. Theincome tax, as a potential purposefully redistributive vehicle, did not emergein the United States until 1913.Former French conservative prime minister Édouard Balladur was dismissive offree-wheeling market competition when he analogized the process to one governedby the law of the jungle, a highly pejorative but eloquent description. “What isthe market?” he asked. “It is the law of the jungle, the law of nature. And whatis civilization? It is the struggle against nature.” We cannot get around thefact that there is a Spencerian “survival of the fittest” aspect to marketadjustments. We can no more change that than we can change its root: humannature. Such a view of the economic world dominated much of nineteenth-centuryAmerica and beyond. It is not an accident that Charles Darwin and HerbertSpencer, with their stark views of human nature, dominated much of the discourseof the second half of the nineteenth century. The values of self-reliance andrugged individualism square with that starkly deterministic view of economiclife. We can choose to buffer the competition’s “losers” from the extremes ofsuffering and want, but we cannot eliminate the competition and the trade-offbetween productivity and such buffering.WE MUST CHOOSEThe choice we are being forced to make is simply this: What type of society dowe wish to live in? One in which self-reliance is the ethos, where governmenthas little role aside from setting the legal conditions of political freedom,such as the rights of minorities spelled out in the first ten amendments to theU.S. Constitution? Or a society and government whose primary function is to“entitle” citizens beyond the individual freedoms defined in our constitution,providing all forms of income transfers crafted to elevate the least privilegedmembers of society to equality of opportunity, if not equality of economicoutcomes? In short, do we wish a society of dependence on government or asociety based on the self-reliance of individual citizens? Which, if either,given human nature, is the most efficient in serving the society as a whole?This is at the root of the political debate between a welfare state andsomething far short of that.With increasing economic abundance through the nineteenth and twentiethcenturies, the inherent economic necessity of the prudence associated with anethos of self-reliance began to fade and morph into our current age ofentitlements. But the conflict within each of us between dependence andself-reliance is made even more acute by the tyranny of economic arithmetic. Wecannot expect to consume virtually all of current production and still createever-rising standards of living. The math doesn’t work.THE POLITICAL RESPONSE: TOO BIG TO FAILAs we’ve seen, the events of 2008—a record postwar collapse of economic activityand the historically unprecedented breakdown in the ability of a number offinancial markets to operate (money market mutual funds, commercial paper, andtrade credit, for example)—spawned a rapid political response that invokedmassive bailouts and reregulation based on the presumption that these heretoforeextremely rare economic outcomes were to become commonplace in the future. Whiledeeply worrisome, this unprecedented response should not have come as asurprise. Economic policy had morphed since Paul Volcker and his Federal Reserveembarked on his then-very controversial tightening of monetary policy in 1979that tilted the U.S. economy into its greatest recession of the postwar years.The Fed’s goal: future economic stability. The reasoning was the same behind theResolution Trust Corporation’s gutsy decision to incur the wrath of Congresswhen in 1989 it began auctioning the remnants of the deteriorating illiquidinventories of the 747 failed savings and loans at deeply discounted prices, anaction that eventually saved the American taxpayers many tens of billions ofdollars.Both the Fed and the RTC sought long-term benefits for the American economy atsignificant short-term political cost. That type of trade-off appears no longeracceptable. Today’s policy makers are no longer allowed to incur short-termrisks to increase the probability of success in achieving long-term gains. Theconsequence has been the emergence of a notion that, prior to 2008, had lainlargely dormant in the backwaters of economic policy: that a business,especially a financial institution, had become “too big to fail” (TBTF). Itscollapse, it is argued, could, because of its interconnectedness with criticalsectors of the economy, bring down large segments of our economy along with it.Coupled with the current heavy bias toward government responding with a“solution” to every conceivable shortcoming of our economy, real or imagined,the doctrine of TBTF is a recipe for economic stagnation.IN THE AFTERMATHAs I noted in Chapter 7 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-12.xhtml], an immediatebroad activist financial response to the Lehman collapse was necessary tostabilize America’s fractured markets after its largest structural rupture ineight decades. But instead of backing away and allowing markets to rebalance inearly 2009, we counterproductively, under the auspices of the Dodd-Frank Act,designated a number of financial businesses as “systemically important.”Although the Dodd-Frank Act explicitly says it is focused on eliminatingfinancial institutions that are “too big to fail,” it does not.25[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber310] How can government,having recently bailed out a number of banks, ever allow an institutiondesignated as “systemically important” to fail? At the end of this road is cronycapitalism (see page 266).Propping up “zombie companies” (as near bankrupt companies have come to beknown) diverts part of the nation’s savings from funding productive technologiesto continuing the support of the obsolescent technologies of our less productive“systemically important” firms. Productive firms that are well run do not seekor need government support; hence, designation as TBTF is superfluous. Itmatters only to those behemoths that are less productive. JPMorgan was pressuredin 2008 to take unneeded bailout money because regulators worried that unlessthe bailouts were seen as an all-encompassing program of assistance,irrespective of need, failing firms would also refuse to accept suchunprecedented assistance for fear of being permanently labeled second rate.Our bankruptcy statutes, with all of their shortcomings, have been a majorcontribution to the flexibility and success of our economy for generations. Oncefinancial markets had stabilized and debtor-in-possession financing becamefeasible, these zombie banks should have been put through the normal time-testedprocess of balance sheet restructure rather than the more politically responsiveprocedures of the postcrisis years. Guarantees with sovereign credit are anaddicting narcotic. This is especially the case when their heavy costs (in termsof lessened competitiveness) are delayed and, even then, insidiously hard toisolate in clear view. Federal credit guarantees accordingly in recent yearshave become regulators’ solution of choice for most financial problems. Butunscored and largely unnoticed is their negative effect on economic flexibility,so critical to economic growth.As I noted in Chapter 5 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-10.xhtml], seventeensystemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) have been designated by atleast one major regulator as too big to fail, effectively rendering themguaranteed by the federal government. But I fear that even sound banks that areable to compete and survive in the roughest times on their own, if designated astoo big to fail, with time will succumb to the awareness that if they takefoolish risks, they will not be subjected to extreme punishment by markets. Thismeans that even more scarce savings of the nation will be diverted to supportless-productive institutions, both financial and nonfinancial, depriving fundingfrom productive technologies. I emphasize in Chapter 9[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-14.xhtml] that when the U.S. government runs adeficit ex post,26 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber311] someother sector of the American economy must be deprived of resources of an equalamount. Alternatively we would need to borrow the equivalent from foreign saversto fund those who are too big to fail. Those companies should be allowed to failand, if necessary, liquidate.As has occurred with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the market has already accordedthese TBTF institutions subsidized funding. This is evident in the cost offunding of large banking institutions relative to competing smaller institutionsnot favored with subsidized borrowings. As I noted in Chapter 5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-10.xhtml], IMF researchers in a recent working paperestimated “the overall funding cost advantage of [global] SIFIs as approximately60 bp in 2007 and 80 bp in 2009.”27[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber312] The top forty-five U.S.banks in this study exhibited about the same degree of support as the globalaverage. I also referenced Federal Reserve research that estimated thecomparable market subsidy to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of 40 bp.28[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber313] In competitive financialmarkets, 40 bp to 60 bp is a very large advantage.Such a market-based subsidy will enable a bank or other financial intermediaryto attract part of the nation’s savings to fund its operations, even if itspolicies and portfolio, unsubsidized, would fail. Even more worrisome, themarket players are beginning to conjecture that, in the event of the nextcrisis, most of the American financial system effectively would be guaranteed bythe U.S. government.The net effect of the politics of the financial crisis, especially in the formof the Dodd-Frank Act, will be to lower the long-term path of the nation’sproductivity and hence growth in standards of living still further. Regrettably,a slowdown in productivity growth from the path it would have otherwise taken isnot politically visible before it will become obvious in a permanent loss ofshare of global GDP.THE “UNTHINKABLE”Prior to the bailout of Bear Stearns, and later General Motors, Chrysler, andAIG, the notion that a large iconic American nonbank corporation would not beallowed to fail was rarely embodied in anybody’s risk management template.29[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber314] Few envisioned a majorcorporation (aside from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) being too big to fail.Virtually all risk managers perceived the future as largely determined bycompetitive markets operating under a rule of law—until 2008, that is.Henceforth it will be exceedingly difficult to contain the range of possiblepolicy activism in the face of even a modest economic disruption. Short of asignificant credible shift in policy direction, promises of future governmentrestraint will not be believed by markets. That became evident, postcrisis, inthe failure of elevated risk spreads on liquid long-term debt to return topre-2007 levels.30 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber315]Uncertainty and the variance it adds to potential outcomes of actions by privatefirms makes the world an economically riskier place.TIMES HAVE SURELY CHANGEDOn May 10, 2012, JPMorgan, America’s largest bank, reported a loss of $2 billionthat resulted from a failed hedging operation.31[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber316] The loss barely reducedJPMorgan’s net worth. Common shareholders of the bank suffered a loss.Depositors of the bank and taxpayers did not. Nonetheless, Jamie Dimon,JPMorgan’s CEO, was called to testify before the Senate Banking Committee. As adirector of JPMorgan between 1978 and 1987, I was aware of numerous sizablelosses that made shareholders unhappy. But I do not recall any bank regulatorpublically commenting on the issue, or the JPMorgan CEO being called to testify.The loss was an issue solely between JPMorgan’s shareholders, its board, andmanagement.Yet the world has so changed that this recent loss was implicitly considered athreat to taxpayers. Why? Because of the poorly kept secret of the marketplacethat JPMorgan will not be allowed to fail any more than Fannie and Freddie havebeen allowed to fail. In short, JPMorgan, much to its chagrin, I am sure, hasbecome a de facto government-sponsored enterprise no different from Fannie Maeprior to its conservatorship. When adverse events depleted JPMorgan’sshareholder equity, it was perceived by the market that its liabilities wereeffectively, in the end, taxpayer liabilities. Otherwise why the politicalumbrage and congressional hearings following the reported loss?Many, if not most, of the seventeen systemically important American banks aremarket competitive and in no immediate prospect of failing to meet theirobligations. History tells us, however, that eventually such dependence ongovernment protection, as I noted earlier, will dull their competitive drive,which can eventually lead to those institutions’ becoming wards of the state.CRONY CAPITALISMCrony capitalism emerges when government has wide discretion in controllingmarkets and favors some private practitioners over others. Those companieseffectively become well-compensated tools of a state that shields them from thewinds of creative destruction. The quid pro quo is important political supportfrom the private firm. They have all of the important characteristics ofcompanies that are too big to fail.My earliest memory of what we now call crony capitalism is PresidentEisenhower’s famous retirement speech on the dangers of the emergence of amilitary-industrial complex. Today crony capitalism’s effect on modern globalmarkets is undeniable. Such firms dominate the economy of Russia, where fealtyto President Putin counts greatly. Widespread publicity regarding relatives ofChina’s political leaders who have accumulated large fortunes, allegedly owingto their political connections, has been an embarrassment to the CommunistParty. Crony capitalism in its various guises affects almost all countries to agreater or lesser extent. The World Bank attempts to measure and rank countriesby the degree to which government has “control of corruption”—a major aspect ofwhich is cronyism. At the top of their list of crony capitalists for 2010 wereVenezuela, Russia, Indonesia, China, India, and Argentina. The least afflictedare the Scandinavian countries, Switzerland, New Zealand, and Singapore.“Cronyism” is rare in the United States because our press would pounce on anyevidence of the type of blatant cronyism that exists in Russia. Nonetheless, weneed to be vigilant.THE RIGIDITIES OF ENTITLEMENT ECONOMICSThe rise of the role of government in the United States has coincided with, andis doubtless a cause of, increasing market rigidity. Competitive flexibility isa necessary characteristic of an innovative growing economy, and we are at theedge of losing it. According to the World Economic Forum, we have fallen incompetitive rankings from first to seventh since 2008. The momentum ofinnovation of past generations is still working its way through large segmentsof our economy, but we are increasingly living off the seed corn of pastharvests, and unless we reverse the inexorable increase in the role ofgovernment, we will surely lose our preeminence as the undisputed globaleconomic leader.The hegemony of the United States was evident to me as I spent more than twodecades32 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber317] in governmentwhen our country was still the undisputed “special nation.” Our status was mostevident in international gatherings at the IMF, the OECD, and meetings of thefinance ministers and central bankers in Basel, Switzerland, and, in fact, allover the world. In recent years, that hegemony, according to Americansparticipating in recent meetings, has faded measurably. However, there is noapparent successor to the role of special nation. I believe we can regain ourleadership role, provided we end our self-destructive policies. I will elaborateon this in the remaining chapters."},{"pageContent":"TWELVEMONEY AND INFLATIONThe spectacle of American central bankers’ trying to press the inflation ratehigher in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis is virtually without precedent. Theonly previous case I can recall was during the 1930s. The gold standard wasabandoned in 1933 because it seemed to be depressing the general price level andinhibiting recovery out of the Great Depression. More important, the restrictivenature of gold undermined the fiscal flexibility required by the New Deal’swelfare state.After a century and a half of stable prices (when the dollar was convertibleinto silver and gold), fiat money1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber318] price inflation tookhold.2 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber319] Between 1933 and2008, the Consumer Price Index of the BLS increased more than fourteenfold, anaverage annual rise of 3.4 percent. Most of the rest of the developed worldabandoned gold during the 1930s and had inflation experiences similar to that ofthe United States. Central banks were as a consequence ceded the role ofcontrolling the supply of money, and hence prices. Most economists at that timeembraced the notion that the long-term growth rate of real GDP was facilitatedby “a little inflation,” and accordingly, central bankers made it their goal tokeep the rate of inflation down rather than to keep the level of pricesunchanged.3 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber320] That policy,of course, acquiesced in an ever-rising price level.In both the ancient and modern worlds, gold and silver have been universallyaccepted as means of payment. Their values are perceived as intrinsic and,unlike every other form of money, they do not need the further backing of creditguarantees by a third party. I have always found the status of these preciousmetals in our societies puzzling.4[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber321] But by the seventeenthcentury, gold and silver had started to become too bulky to handle in the normalcourse of business. That gave rise to paper currencies and eventually bankdeposits (see Box 12.1 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-17.xhtml#box_12_1]).5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber322] Originally, bank moneywas promises to redeem a note on demand in gold or silver; but it soon becameapparent that sovereign government promises to pay eventually, rather than ondemand, still made these fiat monies acceptable, within limits, as a medium ofexchange.But because they are acceptable as a medium of exchange, in addition tofacilitating transactions, they can also serve as a store of value. The amountof cash needed to physically facilitate transactions is almost always quitesmall—amounts hung up in mail float, for example. The rest of money balancesalong with a large number of other assets—bonds, stocks, and even homes—are heldas a store of value.BOX 12.1: REDEEMABLE PAPER CURRENCYAs trade volumes mounted, the physical quantities of precious metals requiredfor transactions became infeasible and by the seventeenth century, papercurrency emerged in the form of “warehouse receipts” (banknotes) for storedgold. Among London goldsmiths, the warehousers of gold, paper promises to pay ingold rapidly began to displace the metal itself. It soon became obvious to thegoldsmiths that much of the gold laid idle most of the time, and because gold isfungible, they realized they could lend out any part of their gold. Onedepositor’s gold was indistinguishable from that of another depositor. Whosegold they lent out did not matter. They could issue far more warehouse receiptsthan they had warehoused gold. Fractional reserve banking was born.Clearly, the average length of time gold deposits laid idle in storagedetermined the extent to which warehouse receipts could be expanded beyond theactual amount of gold deposits. The longer gold depositors left their bullionidle, the larger the proportion of gold “currency” that could be safely loanedout. The well-established goldsmiths soon found that because withdrawals ofstored gold in any month was only a modest fraction of what they held, theycould safely re-lend 50–80 percent of their gold without fear of being unable tomeet the withdrawals of any depositor. The goldsmiths eventually became today’scommercial bankers and their gold reserves were replaced by commercial bankdeposits at central banks. This principle, in modern guise, holds to this day.THE HOLDING PERIODThe average holding period between acquisition of a money and its use topurchase a good, service, or asset is, of course, determined in the end by theperson’s propensity to save. A person living hand to mouth has no ability tosave, and their holding period for money, of necessity, will be quite short. Athigher income levels, holding periods for all forms of assets, money included,are quite long. In all cases, money, the data show, will be held only so long aspeople do not expect it to lose a noticeable part of its value—that is, so longas they don’t expect product prices to rise inordinately. Only when idlestore-of-value balances are spent do prices rise. In the case of extreme pricerise, money holders figuratively rush for the exits; the average length of thecurrency’s holding period collapses, and hyperinflation takes hold.Symmetrically, when people increase their holding period for money balances, bydefinition, spending and prices fall. But so do interest rates, in an extensionof Keynes’s liquidity preference paradigm.FIAT CURRENCYIt is the variability of money-holding periods that has played so large a rolein the history of fiat money and finance in general, and, as we shall see, inthe structure of models of the financial sector. The soon-to-be United Statesfinanced its Revolutionary War, starting in 1775, with paper money(“Continentals”), which people initially accepted in payment for goods andservices. It was used, for example, by General Washington to buy goods andservices for his fledgling army. For a while, most recipients of those proceedsapparently respent them at much the same pace they did with gold before thehostilities began. (That is, the average holding period of the currency wasapparently relatively stable.) But the huge volume of fiat issuance (nearly $250million) engulfed the market and recipients soon found themselves with morepaper money than they needed and presumably began to increase their consumptionexpenditures and asset buying, shortening the overall average holding period.People soon began to spend the currency as quickly as they received it. Theiraverage holding period collapsed. Within three years, the purchasing power ofthe Continental had fallen to less than a fifth of its face value. By the springof 1781, valueless, it ceased to circulate. It was not, so to speak, “worth aContinental.”It is not surprising that when adopted, the Constitution of the United Statesreflected a hard money ethos. United States currency in circulation through thefirst six decades of the nineteenth century was confined to gold and silvercoin, as well as banknotes redeemable for specie, such as those issued by theFirst and Second Banks of the United States.Our history, however, appears to confirm that people are still willing to holdfiat money paper despite losing up to, say, 5 percent or even 10 percent a yearin purchasing power. But beyond that, fiat money holders evidence increasingunease, especially if their incomes are not rising commensurately. When the fiatmoney printing presses speed up, money holders bail out.6[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber323] As money turnoveraccelerates, the currency becomes increasingly unacceptable. In the extreme—theBrazilian financial crisis of 1993–94 comes to mind—the holding period shrinksrapidly as prices explode to the time it takes to accept funds and then unloadthem.7 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber324]THE CHOSENThis raises a second issue of money and finance: From whom are people willing toaccept money in exchange for goods, services, and assets? Anybody can createmoney simply by issuing a personal IOU, but can he or she get anybody else toaccept it as payment for goods or other financial instruments? Sovereign nationswith taxing power have proved the most credible purveyors of fiat money,reflected in their ability to float fiat money debt (IOUs) at interest rateslower than any creditor in their private sectors. Thus, governments or theircentral banks can print money and expect it to be held by the public as a storeof value for an extended period of time—much longer than Continentals, but farshorter than gold or silver. Hence, governments can run budget deficits becausethey are able to find willing buyers for their notes and bonds.MONEY MATTERSThe nature of fiat money, as well as the means to keep fiat money inflation incheck, in recent years has never been in doubt. As the iconic Milton Friedmanonce perceptively asserted, “inflation is always and everywhere a monetaryphenomenon.”8 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber325] In fact, itcould not be otherwise because prices are traditionally defined in units ofmoney, such as cents per pound and dollars per square foot. While “price” isunambiguously defined, or nearly so, money, in the sense that Friedman used theterm, regrettably is not. What economists seek is a universally accepted mediumof exchange. If prices are indeed defined in units of money, we should be ableto find some statistical measure of money such that, when it rose faster than aneconomy’s capacity to turn out goods and services, prices rose; and when moneygrowth was negative relative to the capacity to produce, prices fell.9[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber326] In short, we want ameasure whose numerator is money (or any financial instrument10[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber327]) and whose denominator iscapacity. I call the ratio unit money supply.MONEY CHOICESThere are several series that can be credibly used for the denominator(capacity) of unit money supply. All, more or less, convey the same result. Whatconstitutes money, or more exactly, a universal transaction balance, has beenfar more elusive.There has never been any doubt that currency has to be part of any transactionbalance. Currency and coin for modest-sized transactions have always beenacceptable as payment for goods and services. A potential problem arises becauseof the very large American dollar currency holdings abroad, currently two fifthsof the total.11 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber328] Foreignholdings of U.S. checkable, time, and savings deposits, however, account forless than 5 percent of total deposits. Overall, subtraction of foreign holdingsof currency and deposits does not materially affect the trends of unit moneysupply. Accordingly, I have stayed with the more historically available data onmoney supply as published by the Federal Reserve.I tested a number of choices for money supply and even a number of debtinstruments as a substitute for money. The measures of money supply mosteconomists use are variations of what we call M1, M2, and M3. M1 comprisescurrency, traveler’s checks, demand deposits, and other checkable deposits. M2is equal to M1 plus savings deposits, small-denomination time deposits, andretail money funds. The broadest measure, M3, adds to M2 institutional moneyfunds, large-denomination time deposits, overnight and term repurchaseagreements, and overnight and term eurodollars. Publication of M3 wasdiscontinued by the Federal Reserve in 2006 but can be approximated with datafrom other sources.The data strongly suggest that the measure of money supply that, when divided bycapacity, most closely follows price is Milton Friedman’s choice: M2. Both thenarrower M1 and broader M3 measures do poorly relative to M2 in tracing pricemovements.I use the price for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and fuel,long favored by the Federal Reserve, to represent U.S. domestic prices moregenerally.12 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber329]A TIGHT FITThe closeness of fit of unit M2 and price over the decades is impressive (seeExhibit 12.1 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_12_1]). From 1909 to1933, prices exhibited little long-term trend, as was the case reaching backover the previous century. But from the onset of fiat money in 1933 to date,prices have risen at an annual rate of 3.4 percent on average. Unit M2 rose byan identical 3.4 percent annually. The two series parallel each other throughWorld War I (1917 to 1918), the turbulence of the early twenties, the stabilityof 1925 to 1929, the Great Depression, World War II (1941‒45), the postwar“moderate” inflation (1946 to 1969), and most of the rapid inflation between1969 and 1991. But starting in the late 1980s, unit M2 seemed to have lost itscloseness of fit to the price level. Banks had become fearful that their capitalpositions were inadequate, inducing them to restrain lending. I described theeconomy at the time as confronting “fifty mile-per-hour headwinds.”13[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber330] Provisions for loanlosses as a percent of loans rose to a then-postwar high.The breakdown of M2 spawned a flurry of analyses. I found that the most crediblewas published several years later in an interesting joint paper by economists atthe New York and Dallas Federal Reserve banks, which concluded that M2’shistoric tie to inflation and economic growth had become unhinged and that“depository institutions’ capital difficulties during the late 1980s and early1990s can account for a substantial part of the deterioration in the linkbetween M2 and inflation and economic growth. With these problems now behind us,the link between M2 and economic growth has strengthened.”14[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber331] Although price inflationdid slow somewhat as unit money supply stagnated, I still find the money supplyto price relationship of that period puzzling.15[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber332]Money supply, of course, does not directly translate into price. That occursonly when M2 is drawn upon for the purchase of goods and services. Moneyvelocity is the number of times M2 is turned over to facilitate the transactionsthat make up nominal GDP (see Exhibit 12.2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_12_2]). The ratio of price to unitmoney supply is the virtual algebraic equivalent of what economists call moneyvelocity, the ratio of nominal GDP to M2.16[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber333] As can be seen in Exhibit12.3 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_12_3], my alternative measureof money velocity (see footnote 16) can be explained by the degree ofinflationary pressure on the economy (the operating rate), the level ofshort-term interest rates, and equity prices. The greater the degree ofinflationary pressure, the more likely people will be to accelerate theirturnover of transaction balances; the higher the interest rate or rate of returnon equity, the more likely people are to hold income-earning assets in lieu ofcash, thereby reducing M2 and raising money velocity. Combining thesedeterminants of money turnover with money itself portrays an even closerhistorical fit to the general price level (Exhibit 12.4[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_12_4]). Thus, in summary, moneysupply is by far the dominant determinant of price over the long run, but in theshort run other variables are important as well.Given all the other evidence of suppressed demand, money velocity in 2012 notunexpectedly was at its lowest level in more than a half century.MONEY AND PRICES IN FOREIGN ECONOMIESIn most foreign countries, unit money supply and price moved in patterns similarto those in the United States, though with far less tightness of fit. Incountries with substantial international trade, import prices materially affectthe general price level and hence blur the relationship between price anddomestic unit M2. But the most dramatic example of the inflation-money linkoutside the United States occurred in Brazil between the first quarter of 1993and the third quarter of 1994, when the country’s fiscal and financial breakdownled to a near 150-fold increase in prices and a 180-fold increase in unit moneysupply.THE LOAN/MONEY MULTIPLIERCentral bankers in London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, and Washington have responded tothe aftermath of the 2008 crisis with a massive expansion of their balancesheets. The Fed more than tripled the size of its assets between late 2008 andmid-2013. Nine tenths of the U.S. expansion was funded by the Fed’s creation ofcentral bank money: currency and reserve balances (the monetary base) held bydepository institutions at the Fed. Those commercial and savings banks arecurrently being induced by the Fed to hold the bulge of reserve balances bypaying an interest rate of 25 basis points on those funds.17[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber334]When the banks decide to lend their reserve balances to bank customers, theyfirst have to set aside additional capital and loan loss reserves as insuranceagainst default on the new loan. I estimate that during the years 1995 to 2007,the amount set aside (the monetary base divided by M2) averaged 12 percent ofthe loan (see Exhibit 12.5 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_12_5])18[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber335]. But fear-gripped lendingofficers have been setting aside a much higher percentage of loan acquisitionssince the Lehman collapse—26 percent in 2012 and more than 30 percent as ofmid-2013. Loan officers in recent years have obviously become quite leery oflending to other than the soundest borrowers.Virtually all of the proceeds of new loans are spent on inventories, capitalequipment, cars, homes, and a variety of goods and services.19[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber336] The retail stores,contractors, and all other recipients of the new spending deposit their fundsinto one or more banks. Those banks, in turn, after their necessary set-asides,relend them to customers who proceed to spend the borrowed funds.20[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber337]In short, the initial Fed deposit (or currency issuance) ends up financing along series of ever-diminishing new loans, cumulating to a multiple of the Fed’soriginal central bank money injection. That process continues until theindividual bank set-asides cumulate to the size of the original reserve balanceinjection.21 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber338] How long ittakes to complete the multiple cycles of lending depends largely on the size ofthe set-asides that consecutively drain off the reserve balance. The larger theset-aside, the smaller the loan multiplier. Given the current near-record sizeof the set-asides and the rapid rate of spending loan proceeds, most of the loanmultiplication process presumably takes less than six months after the initialinjection of Fed reserves. Moreover, the pace of decline affects Fed policy. Ifpolicy requires a steady level of central bank assets, the Fed will need toreplenish the reserve balances as they are converted to bank loans and currency.REDUCING THE FED’S BALANCE SHEETThe ratio of M2 to the monetary base in mid-2013 matched its all-time low in1940. The Fed, of course, is fully aware that the current amount of central bankmoney eventually needs to be reined in and, presumably, plans to reduce it priorto the onset of market pressure to do so. The simplest means is to sell Fedassets, almost wholly Treasury notes, bonds, and mortgage-backed securities.This, the conventional procedure by which the Fed tightens credit, will induce asignificant rise in interest rates.22[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber339]The next most effective measures to absorb large amounts of reserves are a hikein reserve requirements and/or issuance of Federal Reserve bills. Again,interest rates would doubtless rise. But latter initiative, however, wouldrequire legislation that, in today’s climate, would be politically precariousfor the independence of the Fed. Unless the economy unexpectedly moves quicklyinto high gear, any credit tightening will, as usual, run into considerablepolitical opposition. It always has.FEAR AND THE FUTUREOne of the themes of this book is that fear induces a far greater response thaneuphoria. Accordingly, asset prices and other fear-sensitive financial variablesmove far more rapidly when falling than they do when rising. Thus, while thecollapse in the money multiplier was sharp and deep following the 2008 crash,23[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber340] its recovery is apt to begradual. There’s not much history to give us guidance to recovery. But what wehave most likely suggests that the pattern of recovery would be that whichfollowed, for example, from 1952 to 1963. That represented a near doubling ofthe money multiplier, spread over the course of eleven years. That would suggesta rate of increase in unit money supply and hence in prices, through 2017,averaging more than 7 percent per year. A similar pace of rise in the multiplierbetween 1918 and 1930 yields an implicit annual rate of price rise from 2012 to2017 of 6 percent.24 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber341]Given so few comparable periods during the past century, such forecasts need tobe viewed as illustrative simulations only. It is easy to contemplate priceacceleration, with today’s Federal Reserve balances unchanged, ranging from 3percent per annum to double digits over the next five to ten years. Interestrates under any scenario will rise, as will arguments that the Fed’s tighteningwas premature.The Fed somewhat surprisingly weathered virtually all assaults on its authorityfollowing the crisis of 2008. Approaching its one hundredth anniversary, it hasa long history of resilience to political forays."},{"pageContent":"THIRTEENBUFFERSNot a day goes by that does not reveal deterioration in some aspect of ournation’s public infrastructure, followed by a call for immediate action. Theaverage age of highways and streets, as estimated by the Bureau of EconomicAnalysis, has increased from sixteen years to twenty-five years since the early1970s. To those of us who have to drive over our increasingly pockmarkedstreets, numbers shouldn’t be necessary. Sewer systems and public hospitalbuildings have aged similarly. Even our national parks are falling behind inmaintenance.But the most visible aging of government assets, and possibly the mostconsequential, is that of our military. Had we not had excess manufacturingcapacity and infrastructure as we entered World War II, we could not havecountered our enemies with overwhelming capacity to produce. The size of budgetdeficits that prevailed during the war was a measure of the extent to which wemarshaled the savings of the private sector to help fund the purchase of warmaterials. But in order to get consumption down and savings up, rationing provednecessary.Since the end of the war, the average age of military buildings and otherfacilities has tripled. If there is such a thing as a poster child of agedmilitary equipment, it surely must be the fleet of B-52s, the long-rangestrategic bomber. It has a long distinguished history. As I wrote in 1952, “Thelong-range intercontinental bomber tasks will be in the hands of a newswept-wing eight-jet bomber now undergoing test—the B-52.”1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber342] Its latest version, theB-52H, whose final production run ended in 1964, did yeoman service as recentlyas 2003 in Iraq. It is scheduled to remain in service beyond 2040. I am certainthat there are innumerable current B-52 pilots whose fathers, and conceivablygrandfathers, flew earlier models of this renowned aircraft. There are stilleighty-five H models, fitted with modern avionics, in our active inventory.The aging of naval ships has gained even greater prominence in the press. Ouraircraft carriers are expected to have a fifty-year service life, and many ofthem are well up in nautical adulthood. I hesitate to include the USSConstitution (“Old Ironsides”), the oldest commissioned warship afloat, awooden-hulled frigate celebrated for its exploits in the War of 1812. It is in aclass of its own. It was first deployed in October 1797 and most assuredly isthe most renowned piece of military equipment still in our inventory. Itspropulsion system is identified by the navy with mock seriousness as 42,710square feet of sail on three masts.If “Old Ironsides” is the oldest naval vessel in our arsenal, the newest,scheduled to be delivered in 2015, is the aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford, thefirst in the Ford class of carriers that are being added to the aging Nimitz andEnterprise class carriers. I can think of no more appropriate tribute to my oldboss, President Ford, than to have a leading edge of our military power namedafter him.The Abrams tank, the main battle tank of the army, is more than thirty yearsold, as is the Bradley armored infantry carrier. Much of the army’s equipment,however, is new, fashioned largely for its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.Some of it, such as the large special trucks engineered to meet the devastationof roadside mines in many sensitive combat areas, may not be relevant in thefuture.It is not quite clear, however, how important the aging is to our nationalsecurity. It all depends on a forecast of who our enemies are going to be fiveto fifteen years from today. Most analysts believe that the probability ofhead-to-head superpower confrontations like those that dominated the first fourdecades following World War II is very small, but no one seems sure. Ourmilitary structure cannot significantly change quickly—the very long deliverylead times preclude it. But the type of military hardware we procure in theyears immediately ahead will depend very much on our longer-term balance ofpower perspectives.The issue of equipment aging divides military and political tacticians and willlikely continue to do so for the intermediate future. I would hope that thisdebate is not resolved by another conflict in which American militarycapabilities are sorely tested.SO, TOO, THE PRIVATE SECTORThe private sector has not been immune from the aging of infrastructure. Sincethe 1970s, the average age of manufacturing industry assets, for example, hasincreased from under eleven years to more than sixteen years. Similar aging isevident in wholesale trade, utilities, and air transport.The share of private nonresidential buildings in real GDP has been in long-termdecline since 1981, and those buildings are not being replaced, probablyreflecting the slowdown in growth of the working-age population (fewer workers,fewer buildings), as well as the recent increased discounting since 2008 ofexpected incomes from very long-lived assets.THE TASK AHEADThere can be little doubt that a major modernization of our infrastructure islong overdue. It is easy to demonstrate the time and motor fuel wasted intraffic jams owing to failure to keep road capacity growing in line with thenumber of vehicles on the road. But fixing the public infrastructure is no easytask. Funding is the major obstacle. Our fiscal position is daunting. To balancethe budget, we need to raise revenue by a fourth or cut outlays by a fifth, orsome combination of the two. We are unlikely to get close to balancing thebudget even within ten years. Increasing federal outlays on infrastructure willincrease the deficit (negative savings) and must be matched, ex post, by acomparable rise in savings less capital investment by households and privatebusiness or by increasing our rate of borrowing from abroad. To the extent thatincreased deficit spending curtails capital investment in other sectors, it is adepressant to economic growth in the short term and productivity in the longterm. But unaddressed is the question of the effect of infrastructure onproductivity. Rising outlays on infrastructure will, of course, increase nominalGDP, which, in turn, should increase the level of gross domestic privatesavings, but not nearly enough to be significant.We are no longer the nation that we were coming out of World War II, which builta visible public (and private) infrastructure while still diverting a large partof our GDP to Cold War defense. We did it then by maintaining a savings rate outof household income of 10 percent. Today, as I’ve noted, that rate is in lowsingle digits.THE LARGER ISSUEOur infrastructure deficiencies are part of a larger problem confronting theUnited States—the amount of our resources we set aside for contingencies. Thereare some inventories that sit unused for years—the Strategic Petroleum Reserves,for one. Some resources we produce stand idle for protracted periods and may infact never be used: vaccine stockpiles for epidemics that never happen and dykesalong rivers that never reach flood levels. By far our largest standby asset is,of course, our military.Such assets serve as guarantees against, for example, foreign invasion, fluepidemics, tsunamis, and hurricanes, none of which are predictable and may neverhappen. They nonetheless require the building up of buffers of idle resourcesthat are not otherwise engaged in the production of consumable goods andservices. They are employed only if and when a crisis emerges. Such buffersaddress contingencies that range from uncertain but repetitive to rare andunpredictable. The former are insurable because they offer a reasonably steadyrate of return to insurers. The latter are not.Individual fires cannot be predicted, but they happen often enough for almostall cities to create and fund fire departments, whose cost is tantamount toinsurance premiums. Health emergencies are not predictable but are alsosufficiently repetitive to create health insurance, hospitals, and ambulances.The buffer may encompass expensive building materials (for example, specialsteels) whose earthquake flexibility is needed for only a minute or two everyhalf century, or lightning rods that could be struck every month, or everydecade.The most visible insurables are life and property. I suspect that the higher thestandard of living, the larger the share of GDP that originates in privateinsurance. Long-term uncertain risks have indeterminate probabilitydistributions and are hence not insurable. Only risks on which actuaries can puta numerical probability are insurable. Risks that are highly variable imply toounstable a rate of return.The choice of funding buffers is one of the most important decisions thatsocieties must make, whether by conscious policy or by default. If policymakers, private and public, choose to buffer their populations against everyconceivable risk, the nation’s current standards of living would, of necessity,decline. Funding such “investments” requires an increase in savings and,accordingly, a decline in immediate consumption. Resources can be put to activeuse or on contingency standby status, but not both at the same time. Buffers area dormant investment that may lie idle and seemingly unproductive for most oftheir lives. But they are included in our total real fixed assets (and real networth) statistics. It is no accident that earthquake protection of the extentemployed in Japan, for example, has not been chosen by less prosperous countriesat similar risk of a serious earthquake. Those countries have either explicitlyor implicitly chosen not to divert current consumption to fund such aneventuality. Haiti, a very poor country, has not yet fully recovered from its2010 earthquake. It had neither built a protective infrastructure like Japan’snor has it had resources to recover on its own. Buffers are largely a luxury ofrich nations. Only rich nations have the resources to protect their populationsagainst events with extremely low probabilities of occurrence.How much of its ongoing output should a society wish to devote to fending offonce-in-fifty or one-hundred-year crises? How is such a decision reached, and bywhom? While the decisions of what risks to take remain predominantly withprivate decision makers,2 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber343]the responses to low-probability events such as the Japanese earthquake andtsunami of 2011 have been largely government scripted. Although formal data arenot available to gauge the depth and quality of our standby buffers, the agingand deterioration of our fixed capital stock, both public and private, is ampleevidence that a subclass of those assets, standby buffers, is also in a state ofdecline."},{"pageContent":"FOURTEENTHE BOTTOM LINEWhen I was first contemplating the substance of this book, I was fully awarethat a basic assumption of classical and neoclassical economics—that peoplebehave in their rational long-term self-interest—was not wholly accurate.Moreover, the crisis of 2008 had impelled me to reassess my earlier conclusionthat our animal spirits were essentially random and hence impervious to economicmodeling. I was amazed, however, during the early months of this venture at justhow many supposedly random variables were explained by statistically highlysignificant regression equations. Many, if not most, economic choices, the datashow, are demonstrably stable over the long run for as far back as I canmeasure. My list is long, though doubtless, incomplete.MODEL BUILDINGProducing a fully detailed model is beyond the scope of this book. But such amodel would include a number of variables reflecting those verities of humannature that reveal long-term economic stabilities. Among them are timepreference (and interest rates), equity premiums, corporate earnings–priceyields, and, since the nineteenth century, the private savings rate. Theyreflect the outer limits to fear and euphoria that define the dynamics of thebusiness cycle. For forecasting purposes they can be assumed to continuetrendless in the future.In addition, there are those stabilities that are not inbred, such as the sum ofsocial benefits and gross domestic savings as a percent of GDP. Other forecaststabilities include the size of the workforce—those potentially in the workforcehave already been born—and average hours worked.Owing to the vagaries of human nature, forecasting will always be somewhat of acoin toss. But I believe if we appropriately integrate some of the aspects ofanimal spirits’ systematic behavior, constrained by market forces reflecting theimperatives of double-entry bookkeeping identities, we should importantlyimprove our forecasting accuracy. Euphoria will always periodically produceextended bull markets that feed off herd behavior, followed by rapidfear-induced deflation of the consequent bubbles.These models should embody equations that, when possible, measure and forecastsystematic human behavior and corporate culture. Regrettably, we have too fewrelevant historical observations that yield confident insights into the wayfinancial markets behave, though we know a great deal more than we did beforethe 2008 crisis.But we are far removed from the halcyon days of the 1960s, when there was greatoptimism that econometric models offered new capabilities to accurately judgethe future. Having been mugged too often by reality, we forecastersappropriately express less confidence about our abilities to look beyond ourimmediate horizons. We will forever need to reach beyond our equations to applyeconomic judgment. Fortunately, most of our intuitive insights, when subject tothe discipline of a syllogism, apparently do conform to reality.We may never approach the fantasy success of either the Oracle of Delphi orNostradamus, but we can surely improve on the discouraging performance of thepast five years.INTROSPECTIONThis journey of analysis has finally come to rest in a place I could never havecontemplated when I first began to recalibrate my economic views in light ofwhat the crisis of 2008 was telling us about ourselves. America started out inthe glorious aftermath of an early post–World War II era when we took the leadin setting up a new international financial system based on the U.S. dollar aswell as an International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and GATT.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber344] As I noted in Chapter 11[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-16.xhtml], it was not until the 1960s that we turnedour national benevolence to the less well off within our own borders and set inmotion an inexorable rise in social benefits to persons. Since its inceptionwith Social Security in 1935, the social benefits program had barelydemonstrated much momentum until Medicare was enacted in 1965 and benefitsembarked on their unrelenting rise from 4.7 percent of GDP to nearly 15 percentof GDP by 2012. As I noted in Chapter 9 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-14.xhtml],had we kept social benefits’ share of GDP to a still large 4.7 percent, as bestI can judge, little of the fiscal chaos we are now experiencing would have foundits way to the front burner of public policy. Especially disturbing is the factthat the retirement of the baby-boomer generation, the recipient of a largeshare of the benefits, has just begun.But we have sadly learned that social benefits, never contemplated in asignificant role of government before the Depression of the 1930s, havedeveloped a whole infrastructure of political constituencies in support of everynew entitlement. Trust funds for social benefits were crafted to mirror fullyfunded private pension plans. Contributions to trust funds plus interest and,since 1984, taxes on benefits, however, have fallen far short of full funding ofbenefits, according to the funds’ official actuaries. But even the federalgovernment’s efforts to finance all of these programs on at least apay-as-you-go basis have also fallen short, to a point where a fifth of federalgovernment outlays (especially benefits) have to be borrowed in financialmarkets. The source of those funds is almost wholly private domestic savings andwhatever savings we can borrow from abroad.Postwar current account surpluses reflected the unmatched generosity of America.Exports of abundant grains2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber345] from America’s heartlandand industrial materials and capital goods were shipped from our shores in 1947and 1948. But starting in 1982, the surplus ran out and we began instead to haveto borrow from foreign businesses, individuals, and governments to supplementour diminishing flow of domestic savings. Those borrowings have created a netAmerican debt to the rest of the world valued currently at nearly $5 trillion.As our government budget deficits rose, gross domestic savings fell pari passu.The cause of our diminished flow of gross domestic savings, as I document inChapter 9 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-14.xhtml], is demonstrably governmentsocial benefits to persons.Gross private domestic savings as a share of GDP have been remarkably stablereaching back to 1870 (see Exhibit 9.5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_9_5]). It remains the primarysource of funding of American gross domestic investment—the source ofproductivity growth and standards of living. Personal consumption expenditures,by definition, add nothing to our capital stock and hence nothing to our futurestandards of living.Yet social benefits, almost all of which are consumed, as I demonstrate inChapter 9 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-14.xhtml], have been a virtualdollar-for-dollar diversion of private savings flows from private fixed capitalinvestment to personal consumption expenditures. As CBO data demonstrate, owingin part to the continued rise in income inequality, the highest quintile ofincome earners accounted for 94 percent of individual income tax liabilities in2009, up from 64 percent in 1981.3[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber346] That quintile has been amajor source of funding for the rise in benefits. The average savings rate ofthe top quintile is approximately 10 percent to 15 percent of income,4[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber347] but I calculate that themarginal savings rate of this group is triple that, as I document in Chapter 9[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-14.xhtml]. Household savings as a percent ofdisposable personal income have declined from approximately 10 percent in themid-1970s to less than half of that in 2013.5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber348] The unexpected outcome ofthe switch from savings funding investment to financing consumption has been thesignificant decline in the growth rate of GDP and the erosion of householdmiddle incomes.American business, however, is doing well. Cash flow has risen significantly,not because the economy is robustly expanding (it has not) but because businesscosts are under control, with competitively and technologically suppressedhourly wage costs of production workers rising less than 2 percent annuallyduring the past couple of years, and even less in real terms (see Box 14.1[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-19.xhtml#box_14_1]). This weakness reflects, inpart, the remarkable decline in private sector union participation. The evidenceconfirms that collective bargaining does increase union wage premiums. Publicunions have also come under stress as diminished tax revenues increasingly presson state and local employee earnings.But even our still vibrant corporate sector seems hardly likely to continuethriving unless the pall of uncertainty is lifted and a far greater proportionof its abundant cash flow is invested in capital outlays. This is especiallyimportant because, with government outlays constrained by deficits, the onlysignificant source of self-generating spending is private business that, withlarge unused cash flows, has resources to expand (see Box 14.2[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-19.xhtml#box_14_2]). American innovation continuesto edge out global competition, but the diminishing rates of GDP and multifactorproductivity gains—the latter our measure of the extent to which innovationcontributes to a higher growth rate—are worrisome.BOX 14.1: THE MISMATCHThe increasing shortfall of adequate skills to match the ever-rising needs ofour workforce has led in recent years to a shift in the composition of capitalinvestment toward labor-saving equipment. That has pressed many semiskilledworkers’ wages lower as robots take over routine though still complex tasks.Pressure on highly skilled workers’ wages has been less, especially given thelimited quotas for competitive high-skilled immigrants.With, as I noted in Chapter 8 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-13.xhtml], anapparently inbred upper limit to human IQ, are we destined to have an eversmaller share of our workforce staff our ever more sophisticated high-techequipment and software? Even taking into account population growth, do we everreach the point when all we have left is a small handful of especially talentedpeople who can create and operate the newer technologies?Technology rarely moves at the same pace as the educational capabilities of aworkforce. While there is an upside limit to the average intellectualcapabilities of a population, there is no upper limit to the complexity oftechnology. This implies an ever greater need of automation where robots’simulated intellectual capabilities must begin to have the capacity (taught byhuman beings) that we have yet to imagine.The gap between job openings and new hires in an increasing number ofoccupations raises the specter that, at our best, we may not have the capabilityto educate and train students up to the level increasingly required bytechnology to staff our ever more complex capital stock. The median attainmentof our students just prior to World War II was a high school diploma. That levelof education at the time, with its emphasis on practical shop skills, matchedthe qualifications, by 1950s standards, for a reasonably skilled job in a steelmill or auto-assembly plant. The mass of our labor force then was stilldominated by high school graduates and less. On-the-job training filled whateducation holes still existed. These were the middle income jobs of that era.But the skill level required of today’s highly computerized technologies cannotbe adequately staffed with today’s median skills. Moreover, much of whatabsorbed labor a half century ago has been displaced by robots and more advancedforms of labor-saving technologies. It is in this context that the seemingfailure of our primary and secondary school systems (K to 12) in recent yearsraises concerns about levels of future productivity growth.BOX 14.2: THE MULTIPLIERIt is always difficult to envision the source of recovery or decline in economicactivity when such a large proportion of that activity is endogenous, that is,determined solely by responses to the initiatives of others. The reason for thecurrent suppressed economic environment is that inflowing orders are themselvesreflecting incoming orders of others. How does an economy exit self-reinforcingstagnation? Fortunately, not all order placements are in response to otherplayers in the economy. For example, a company with a new invention decides tobuild a new plant to manufacture widgets for which there is yet a market. Theactivity of building the new plant increases the stream of endogenous ordersthat are set off by the initiative of the new investment. That process,duplicated many times over, will enlarge the flow of endogenous orders that willcarry the total economy to higher levels. This is the famous economic multiplierat work.LOOKING BACKThe most problematic trend that has emerged from this crisis is the doctrine of“too big to fail” (TBTF). As I explain in Chapter 5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-10.xhtml], the role of finance is to allocate thesavings of a society toward funding the most promising cutting-edge investments.TBTF aborts that process and economic growth and is rapidly spawning an Americancrony capitalism. I have come to a point of despair where, if we continue tomake banks wards of the state through TBTF policies, I see no alternative toforcing banks to slim down to below a certain size threshold where, if theyfail, they will no longer pose a threat to the stability of American finance.LOOKING AHEADI have purposely refrained from the type of long-term forecast that I made sixyears ago for the year 2030 in The Age of Turbulence because it required, thenand now, an assumption that there would be no “governmental restrictions againstcompetition in domestic markets” (page 467). I cannot make such an assumptioncurrently yet cannot think of a credible alternative assumption.Integrating evidence of how people responded during the recent years of extremeeconomic stress has furthered economists’ understanding of financial andeconomic relationships during periods that almost all of us have rarely, if atall, experienced. We have learned a great deal about tail risk and risk aversiongenerally. Bubbles seem more understandable, as does the fragility of markets.The exercise is scarcely complete, but I believe economists now have gainedaccess to a vast array of data that no generation has had before. Those newlyavailable data have allowed me to answer the question that I put to myself inChapter 1 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-6.xhtml]: “We humans appear a trulyhomogenous species. But at root, what are we?” The answer, I now tentativelyconclude, at least from an economist’s perspective, is that we are driven by awhole array of propensities—most prominent, fear, euphoria, and herdbehavior—but, ultimately, our intuitions are broadly subject to reasonedconfirmation.That reason persuades me and most economists to conclude that modern industrialcapitalism, despite earlier excess enthusiasm of what it could accomplish, hasbeen the most effective form of economic organization ever devised, a factattested to by the remarkable gains in material well-being and life expectancythat it has produced since its emergence during the eighteenth-centuryEnlightenment.But at its core is creative destruction, a system of winners and losers. If wewish to achieve ever higher levels of productivity and standards of living,there is no alternative to displacing obsolescent low-productivity facilitieswith facilities embodying those technologies at the cutting edge. Arithmeticrequires it. But there is the inevitable hardship imposed on significantsegments of our workforce who lose their jobs and often their homes in thatprocess of displacement.POLITICAL SCHISMThe conflict of goals has manifested itself most visibly in recent battles overAmerican federal budget priorities. These battles have exposed a schism in ournational electorate that is unprecedented in our postwar experience. Thepolitical conflicts we are currently experiencing reflect the fiscal, monetary,and regulatory paths on which we find ourselves. The angst has had profoundeffects on long-term business investment confidence, as reflected in suppressedinvestment in assets with life expectancies over twenty years (see Chapter 7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-12.xhtml]). Following its collapse, hopefully homebuilding is on an important rebound. But at its latest reading (June 2013),single-family housing starts were still only a third of where they were at theirpeak of seven years ago.We need to lift the burden of massive new financial regulation that is becomingincreasingly counterproductive (see Chapter 5[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-10.xhtml]). Overall business capital expenditures,as a share of cash flow, need to continue to rise from their lowest readingssince the Great Depression of the 1930s. If we remove the pall of uncertainty onbusiness and investors and merely return equity premiums to near normal, therise in stock and other asset prices will do more to galvanize our recentlymoribund job market than any currently proffered government program (see Chapter4 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-9.xhtml]). Moreover, we need to increase the levelof bank lending currently suppressed by the lethargic demand for funds and theperceived need of banks to protect their equity capital (see Chapter 12[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-17.xhtml]).I recognize that such a reversal will put us back into a mode of elevatedcreative destruction and rejuvenated animal spirits. I see no alternatives,given human propensities that are prone to excess. I see no way of removingperiodic irrational exuberances without at the same time significantlydiminishing the average rate of economic growth and standards of living. Therewas no irrational exuberance in the Soviet Union and none in today’s NorthKorea. But there was, and is, a depressed standard of living. Rising standardsof living require innovators who have unlimited expectation of success andperseverance no matter how many times they fail. Thomas Alva Edison inparticular comes to mind. Exuberance (the propensity for optimism) isrequired—even if at times it runs to excess.Our fractional reserve financial structure is inevitably a source ofinstability. That can be readily addressed, however, by expanding the level ofcapital requirements of our banks and other financial intermediaries by morethan currently contemplated. In doing so, we can remove many of the threats ofan unstable financial system. Had large capital buffers been in place in 2005and 2006, extensive losses would have nonetheless occurred, but they need nothave toppled the financial system. With adequate capital, no contagious defaultscould have arisen. For some banks, “adequate” equity capital requirements,however, may be too high to produce a competitive return on equity. They willhave to shrink or liquidate. But high capital requirements, I strongly suspect,will also nudge the ratio of net income to assets higher in the process, leavingnet income as a percent of capital in line with history’s remarkable period ofstable returns to equity (see Chapter 5 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-10.xhtml]).THERE MUST BE A BETTER WAYOur highest priority going forward is to fix our broken political system. Shortof that, there is no viable long-term solution to our badly warped economy. InAmerica we are being pulled apart politically in ways unrivaled since theaftermath of the 1929 crash.Fortunately, modern societies have finally abandoned as unworkable the variouseconomic models of socialism that were so popular a century or more ago. But weneed to recognize that welfare states, unless contained, have proven similarlytrouble prone. Even the long-vaunted welfare model of Sweden has felt the needfor a significant overhaul.6[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber349]Democratic societies such as ours require a broad and deep adherence to a set ofprinciples that are not subject to compromise. As I noted in Chapter 10[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-15.xhtml], for Americans it is our Bill of Rights.But if 300 million people are to live in relative peace and tranquillity, mostevery other legislative initiative must be subject to compromise. If everydebate were on a matter of uncompromisable principle, we could never reachagreement on a functioning set of laws to which virtually the whole societycould adhere. Such a condition happened once in this country and it led towrenching internecine warfare. For the nation’s first nearly three quarters of acentury, the festering inconsistency of adhering to the principle that “all menare created equal” yet condoning slavery finally exploded with, and was resolvedby, a civil war. Our nation has since fought its way through two world wars, aGreat Depression, a constitutional crisis leading to the resignation of apresident, and most recently a Supreme Court ruling to determine the outcome ofa presidential election.My first realization of a striking shift in our politics was brought to myattention by the staunch conservative three-term senator from Utah, RobertBennett. He feared that despite his strong approval ratings, his 2010 reelectionbid was by no means secure. In his 2004 reelection, Bennett won 69 percent ofthe vote. His problem, as he stated it, was unexpected contenders for his Senateseat from his political right. It was my first awareness of what later came tobe known as the Tea Party, a political movement that emerged in 2009 and becamea powerful force in the 2010 election.THE STAKESBoth uncompromising sides of our ongoing debate on fiscal and other issues needto recognize that financial crisis lurks should we fail to resolve our deeplydisruptive fiscal imbalance. And that imbalance is far greater than the officialdata portray (see Box 14.3 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-19.xhtml#box_14_3]).Differences even of the current magnitude are not new in this country, but as Inoted in Chapter 10 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-15.xhtml], we seem to have lostour legislative ability to reach across the aisle to find common ground forsolutions. At risk is the status the American economy has held as the preeminentworld economic power for more than a century.BOX 14.3: CONTINGENT LIABILITIESThroughout most of American history, a private bank or firm under stress wasexpected to either save itself or file for bankruptcy. Government bailouts werealmost never on the table. That ethos remained largely intact into thetwenty-first century. Even Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were “officially” not toobig to fail as late as 2006. The bailout premise cracked in 2007 and waseviscerated in 2008. The general current expectation in most markets is thatlarge financial institutions and some iconic nonfinancial firms, in trouble,would be rescued by the government. Virtually overnight the liabilities of much,if not most, of finance, along with some nonfinancial debt, became de factocontingent liabilities of the U.S. government (including the Federal Reserve).For decades, American sovereign debt has always been a potential, but rare,source of support for private financial intermediaries (Continental Illinois)and nonfinancial firms (Lockheed). But the recent bailout of General Motors andChrysler has underscored a future willingness on the part of government, as analmost routine policy initiative, to backstop private business far moregenerously. Central banks in developed countries, more generally, have also madeit clear by their actions in 2008 and since that in the event of a futurepending default of the private financial system, they will step in and provideas much credit as is required to prevent such defaults and their associatedcontagion. For finance, such guarantees ultimately lead to a collapsing andconsolidating of much of the banking system into the central bank. This has infact already occurred to the banking systems of the southern Eurozone. Moreover,expansions in a central bank’s assets and monetary base have always createdincreases in money supply (transaction balances) (see Chapter 12[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-17.xhtml]) that, with a long lag, almost invariablyignite the general price level.POLITICAL WASHINGTONMy introduction to “political Washington” came in the 1960s when I was firstinvited to the dinners that were hosted by the Washington Post’s KatharineGraham, pundit Joseph Alsop, and others. To my recollection, the invitees tothese dinners were ritualistically half Democrats and half Republicans. Today,attendance at similar dinners is predominantly a 95 to 5 percent split, witheither Democrats or Republicans in the majority.A NECESSARY IMPERATIVEThe bias toward unconstrained deficit spending is our top domestic economicproblem. During the 1920s and earlier, budget deficits were avoided becausethere was a fear that they would immediately engender financial distress andinflation. That view, of course, was uninformed and soon was set aside asdeficits arose and the sky did not fall.7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber350] But the fact remains thatthe only way to get permanently lower tax rates is to lower spending. We arefooling ourselves if we believe otherwise. I acknowledge the possibility, oreven probability, that we may not be able to solve the social benefits dilemmawithout some form of crisis that would reset the political incentives towardrestraint. But wise heads may preempt such an outcome. I miss the likes ofSenators Howard Baker, Bob Dole, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and Lloyd Bentsen,whose wisdom is sorely needed in today’s halls of Congress.So long as the pall of economic uncertainty that created the severe retrenchmentof long-lived investments persists (see Chapter 7[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-12.xhtml]) and fiscal policy remains in stalemate,inflation is most likely to remain contained. But as economic uncertaintyeventually lifts, driven by our propensity for optimism, so will businessactivity, inflation, and interest rates. But as our experience in the secondhalf of 1979 demonstrated, change can happen unexpectedly and rapidly.8[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-22.xhtml#EndnoteNumber351] If late 1979 is anycriterion, inflationary crises will engender seminal changes in fiscal policyand politics.Contemplating a return to years of balanced government budgets does currentlyseem a bit of a stretch. Moreover, even if we can retain America’s century-longgross domestic private savings rate that ranged mostly between 15 percent and 20percent of GDP, we still need to address how those savings will be invested inthe future.Despite its temporary breakdown in 2008, the U.S. financial system is stillclearly in the forefront of global finance, as it has been since the end ofWorld War I. Viable competitors to replace the U.S. dollar as the world’sreserve currency are nowhere in sight. Russia’s financial system has advancedfrom its Soviet legacy, but its capitalism is more “crony” than it is AdamSmith. China may someday develop highly advanced finance, but that will takemany years of cumulative progress on its financial infrastructure and processes.Admittedly, however, our international status is not what it was.But before I despair of the future, I need to remind myself that we have beenhere before. Consider the national psyche of the United States in 1940. We hadjust been through a near decade of economic stagnation. The future appearedbleak. America’s greatness was in our past. Less than a decade later, theAmerican economy was humming on all cylinders."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis book would have barely gotten off the ground, and certainly would neverhave reached completion, were it not for the dedication of my three keyassistants—Noah Hall, Jeffrey Young, and Katie Byers Broom. Noah deciphered andedited my illegible script through the many iterations of the book andcontributed significantly to the research behind it as well, both quantitativeand qualitative. Jeff conducted the majority of the countless statisticalanalyses that supported the narrative of the book and controlled the more thansixty exhibits displayed throughout. Katie researched many historical topics andaccordingly compiled data series that allowed me to extend much of the book’spivotal investigations well into our past.I am indebted to the large number of my former Federal Reserve Board colleagueswho were most helpful in recollecting our shared experiences over myeighteen-year tenure. David Stockton in particular, since retired from theBoard, was of immeasurable assistance in the early months of researching andwriting this book until previous commitments to the Bank of England called himaway. Pat Parkinson, also formerly of the Fed, has kept me abreast on the latestinnovations of the derivatives markets. Peter Wallison and Brian Brooks enhancedmy understanding of the legal intricacies of mortgage markets.For the second time in seven years, Scott Moyers of Penguin Press shepherded methrough the joys and agonies of book writing. His clarity of thought helped mestructure the arguments of this effort. His colleague at Penguin Press MallyAnderson acted as the liaison between my team and all of the departments atPenguin that had a hand in turning our initial draft of the manuscript into, Itrust, a polished, shelf-ready book. She also offered her own valuable editorialinsights, particularly in the selection of in-text exhibits.Finally, I owe my deepest gratitude to my wife Andrea, whose support andencouragement through pressured periods of writing was indispensable to myeffort.As I warned in The Age of Turbulence, there are errors in this book. If I knewwhere they were, I would have fixed them.

That outcome wasmost stark when interest rates on savings and loan (S&L) liabilities (mostlyshort term) rose sharply in the early 1980s, dramatically increasing theinstitutions’ cost of debt. Interest rates on new mortgages also rose, butbecause the maturity of the mortgage assets was quite long, only the few newlyissued mortgages of the S&Ls increased their income. The income from the vastmajority of their mortgages was unchanged. The effect was to squeeze earnings,and much of the industry filed for bankruptcy as a consequence.28 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-8.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber76].

Clearly that wasnot the case for the savings and loan industry that had assumed interest rateswould remain low forever. They did not.

AlthoughGramm-Leach-Bliley repealed the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, the mandatoryseparation of commercial and investment banking had essentially already beennullified more than a decade earlier. An April 1987 court ruling had legalizedan interpretation of Glass-Steagall that enabled bank holding companies to haveaffiliated investment banks. These affiliates that came to be known as Section20 affiliates had become ubiquitous well before the passage of Gramm-LeachBliley. The important contribution of Gramm-Leach-Bliley was the significantreduction of costs of engaging in both commercial and investment bankingactivities, achieved by repealing the barriers and red tape associated withSection 20 affiliates. The repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in fact changed verylittle. From the enactment of Gramm-Leach-Bliley in 1999 to the FederalReserve’s acceptance of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as financial servicesholding companies at the height of the crisis, no applications to employ thegreater powers were forthcoming. That forbearance apparently reflected a desireto stay clear of the Federal Reserve’s regulatory embrace.24 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-10.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber118].

Ex ante (beforethe fact) and ex post (after the fact), terms largely attributed to Swedisheconomist Gunnar Myrdal, are widely used in macroeconomics to define the processby which disparate levels of intended savings and investment (ex ante) arebrought into equality, ex post, through interest rates and other rates of returnon assets. Although we have no direct measure of ex ante, we assume that if, atan interest rate, saving intentions exceed investment intentions, the rate ofinterest will fall until both savings and investment are brought into equality.Similarly, rates will rise in the reverse situation.21 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-12.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber170].

A broaderhistorical measure, of course, would include our farm workforce and its output—amajor component of the U.S. economy into the early twentieth century. But twofactors lead to the choice of examining the long-term trends in the nonfarmsector. First, the level of farm productivity tends to be far less than that ofthe nonfarm sector. And second, the share of our workforce devoted to farminghas dwindled to around 2 percent (see Chapter 6[../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-11.xhtml]), and the rapid replacement oflow-output-per-hour farm workers with nonfarm workers imparted a rate ofincrease in national productivity heavily affected and distorted by the transferof work from farm to nonfarm.

I suspect thatthis surprising degree of long-term stability reflects, in part, a large andslowly growing capital stock with an average age of more than twenty years.Obviously, the greater the average age, the slower the rate of turnover and themore stable the flow of imputed “services” from that stock relative to otherfactors of growth.

Whether Social Securityis fully funded or not has nothing to do with the security of payments to futurebeneficiaries. Benefits in either case are de facto fully guaranteed by the U.S.government. Because the federal government will cover any shortfall in the trustfunds with general revenues, it is no longer conceivable that, as required bylaw, benefits will be cut in the event of a depletion of trust fund assets.7 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-14.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber227]. Pay-as-you-gofunding requires only that current receipts of trust funds (contributions,interest, and, since 1984, taxation of benefits) cover current benefits. In thisparadigm, contributions for social insurance or other taxes would have to risesharply in line with the projected rise in benefits paid out to the retiringbaby-boom generation. Full funding sets the payroll tax rates at fixed (higher)levels that will accumulate assets in the trust funds prior to the accelerationof benefits and then run them off as benefits rise. That smoothing effectcreates an economically nondisruptive trust fund.

The propensity tosave out of household income has clearly been no match against the forcesdriving personal consumption. (Household consumption as a percent of incomehovers between 90 percent and 95 percent.) The same pressures do not exist inthe business sector, however, because business has no avenue to consumeconspicuously.

Of course, ifintentions to save in the private sector and among foreign lenders to the UnitedStates exceed ex ante U.S. funding requirements, there is no savings (and henceno investment) to be crowded out. In fact, the excess of savings intentions willtend to suppress interest rates and rates on other income-earning assets,thereby inducing some “crowding in”—that is, an increase of both savings andinvestment. Crowding in was particularly evident between 1998 and 2001 when theU.S. government was running a (rare) surplus.

I chose capacityinstead of output because a unit M2 measure using capacity as its denominatorbehaves statistically slightly better than one using output (GDP). Moreover,unused capacity can be brought into a market to satisfy rising demand withoutprices rising inexorably.The capacity of GDP is derived by first separating gross nonfarm business GDP(76 percent of total in 2012) into industrial and all other. I obtain a firstcut industrial capacity by dividing industrial GDP by Federal Reserve operatingrates, and a first cut nonindustrial capacity by dividing nonindustrial businessGDP by ISM nonmanufacturing operating rates. The sum of the two, moderatelysmoothed, yields capacity for gross nonfarm business product. I assumed the restof GDP (24 percent in 2012) operated at 90 percent of capacity and calculatedits capacity by dividing gross nonbusiness GDP by 0.9.

Money velocitycan be seen as equal to nominal GDP divided by M2. Unit money supply is equal toM2 divided by real GDP. Given that nominal GDP is equal to real GDP times theimplicit price deflator, the ratio of price to unit money supply is equivalentto money velocity. In my exhibits, the two series differ solely because (1) Iuse the more statistically significant “real capacity” as the denominator ofunit money supply, rather than real GDP, and (2) I use the price of corepersonal consumption expenditures, rather than the GDP deflator, as my measureof price.17 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-17.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber334].

Whether theclaims banks have on the Federal Reserve are in the form of deposits or holdingsof Federal Reserve notes does not affect the size of the set-aside. It is basednot on the nature of central bank money but on the risk that the recipient of abank loan will default. This is the reason that the ratio of M2 to the monetarybase (the money multiplier) implies a set-aside that parallels the ratio ofcapital plus loan loss reserves to total loans outstanding surprisingly well(see Exhibit 12.5 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-21.xhtml#exhibit_12_5]). I choseto use the balance sheet ratio rather than the more relevant income statementdata (allowances plus new equity capital, as a ratio to gross loan extensions)because comparable data on loan extensions are not available. That the moneymultiplier was an unexpectedly low 3.7 in 1948, a relatively prosperous year,reflects the very large expansion of the monetary base created to help financethe war.19 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-17.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber336].

For example,given a 20 percent set-aside, $100 in reserves created by the Fed wouldultimately lead to an increase in bank loans of $500 ($100 + 0.8 x $100 + 0.8 x$80 + 0.8 x $64 + . . . = $500). The total increase in loans in ourfractional-reserve banking system as a ratio to the Fed’s initial injection offunds is called the money multiplier. It originally referred to the expansionconstrained by legal reserve requirements. However, it works in much the sameway when banks determine their own capital and loan loss set-asides.22 [../Text/9781101638743_EPUB-17.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber339].
