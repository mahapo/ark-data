BOX 8712, PHOENIX, ARIZONA 85066  "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" A U.S. POLICE ACTION PURPOSE The Police Officers, National Guardsmen and milita ry officers who have contributed to this special publication are aware o f a plan to overthrow the Constitutional Republic of these United States of A merica. This publication, many months in preparation, was f ound difficult to compile for many reasons. One important reason was that none of the officers involved were pleased with the duty of bringing to the attention of our colleagues the names and activities of some in our nation who have been in t he past (or presently) engaged in what can only be described by law as treason and/or sedition against their own government. While detailing the plan of these Internationalists , the main goal of this special police publication will be to promote an active program th at will defend America from those at work forming an oligarchy of Imperialism a gainst this nation of free people. The herein-described plan to halt this un-American activity can succeed only with the combined efforts of the People's Protectors (th e Police, Guardsmen and Military) and their countrymen in the private sector. TREASON AND SEDITION DEFINITIONS: In defining \"treason\" and \"sedition\" we look to the Fifth edition of Black's Law Dictionary. pg. 1345, and pg. 1218 TREASON: The offense of attempting by overt acts to overthrow the government of the state to which the offender owes allegiance; or of betraying the state into the hands of a foreign power. SEDITION: ...knowingly becoming a member of any org anization which advocates the overthrow or reformation of the existing form o f government of this state by violence or unlawful means. The facts and information about some of the persons and their actions listed in this special report is prima facie evidence of their lon g involvement in activities directly designed to overtly overthrow the lawful, constitut ional government of the United States of America. These individuals thus hope to d eliver the People of the U.S. into the hands of a foreign power known as the United Na tions, which is actually an oligarchy of the world's super-rich, who have no al legiance to any one nation and who control the U.N. from behind the scenes."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"As the reader will find, many of these persons are, or have been, members of various organizations that have as their purpose the destru ction of this Constitutional Republic. IMPORTANT NOTE: Not all of the people listed in thi s report are involved in treason and sedition against the United States. Som e of the individuals listed and quoted are presenting evidence of these crimes comm itted by others or are listed/quoted for informational purposes only. As patriotic Americans of all races, religions and political beliefs, we claim our right to defend our Republic from all enemies foreign and domestic. This educational work is one such attempt. THE NEW AGE / NEW WORLD ORDER GOVERNMENT PLAN Many of our nation's INTERNAL PROTECTORS know of th e well laid plan which will culminate in the year 2000, to usher the Unite d States, along with the rest of the nations of the world, into a \"utopian\" global commu nity allegedly under the control of a \"philanthropic\" United Nations. A great many o f our fellow Officers and National Guardsmen are taking a stand against this plan because they realize that their fellow Americans were never allowed to know o f this plan nor given the opportunity to vote on such a change in their gover nment. In addition, the officers are concerned patriots and realize that this plan o f world domination is injurious in the extreme, and a total fraud perpetrated against the people of the world! This publication outlines the plan of these America n Internal Protectors which they believe will stop this diabolical agenda. THE NEW ORDER Allegedly this new order is being set up to save TH E PEOPLE OF THE WORLD from a whole variety of \"imminent\" life and world t hreatening disasters. Of those sworn protectors of the people that are aware of th is global scheme, few realize that the actual behind the scenes plan is for an oligarc hy of the world's richest families to place 1/2 the masses of the earth in servitude unde r their complete control, administered from behind the false front of the Uni ted Nations. To facilitate management capabilities, the plan calls for the eli mination of the other 2.5 billion people through war, disease, abortion and famine by the year 2000. As we can plainly see, their plan for \"Population Control\" (r eduction) is well established and under way. OPERATION VAMPIRE KILLER 2000 PLAN Our OPERATION VAMPIRE KILLER 2000 plan involves the awakening (education) of our fellow officers to the extreme n eed for them to take an immediate and active role in assisting their fellow Americans in stopping this plan for world"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"domination, using every lawful means available. HUMAN PARASITES These elitists and their families have made most of their massive fortunes off the American people, and have dedicated entire lifetime s to using public funds to subjugate the People to the will of their new world ARISTOCRACY. This special police officer publication is a privat e endeavor, and is dedicated to those sworn Protectors of the People who refuse to play a role in enslaving their countrymen. We are proud of these brave Officers wh o are presently assisting other patriotic Americans of all races and creeds in halt ing this program for world domination called the NEW AGE/NEW WORLD ORDER. Some of our Police/National Guardsmen readers sugge sted names for this private police action plan. Our government, to maintain pri vacy in its activities, has long been in the practice of choosing unusual names for covert operations, such as \"Transylvania & Co.\", \"Garden Plot\", \"Operation Zap ata\", \"Thunder Muffin, Inc.\", \"Operation Watchtower\", and \"Cable Splicer\", to nam e a few. We officers, while in the alternative, desiring the greatest amount of pu blicity about our plan of attack against these anti-American types, likewise have ch osen a cute little name for our off-duty, First Amendment POLICE ACTION. That name is: \"OPERATION VAMPIRE KILLER 2000\" It is felt that this name reflects the actual progr am in which officers are involved, designed to stop or \"kill off\" the ongoing, elitist , covert operation which has been installed in the American system with great stealth and cunning. They, the globalists, have stated that the date of termination of the Ame rican way of life is the year 2000. Therefore it is fitting that our date to terminate, at the very least; their plan, is also the year 2000. LET IT BE WELL UNDERSTOOD, WE PROTECTORS OR THE AME RICAN PEOPLE HAVE NOT ASKED FOR THIS BATTLE. IT IS OUR NA TION'S ENEMIES WHO HAVE BROUGHT THIS FIGHT TO THE VERY DOO R OF EVERY GOOD AMERICAN. BE IT RESOLVED: • Our prayer and promise is to do all within our powe r, as faithful countrymen, to overthrow this evil, treasonous plan in a comple tely non-violent, lawful manner. • Our sworn duty is to protect the people of this nat ion and its Constitutional, republican form of government from any enemy that w ould come against it. • Our pledge is that WE WILL, BY EVERY MEANS GIVEN UN TO US, UPHOLD OUR OATHS AND FULFILL OUR SWORN DUTY TO OUR"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"COUNTRYMEN. PUTTING THE STAKE THROUGH DRACULA'S HEART WHAT CAN WE DO, WHAT SHOULD WE DO? The Globalists' agenda is a diabolical program which, through patient gradualis m, is slowly draining the moral, economic and political life blood from the United S tates and the hard working American people. We in America, Officers and private citizens alike, are fortunate that at this moment in our history we can still LAWFULLY EXTERMINATE th ese parasitic Global Blood Suckers by placing numerous \"STAKES\" made of words, paper, pen, and hard work through their hardened hearts. EVIDENTIARY FOUNDATION Presented here are oft-used, famous quotes and stat ements which will make for easy reference for those who wish to use them to educate our fellow officers, National Guardsmen and military, or the private sector. As t he reader will see, most of these statements have been around for many decades and ar e known by those who study history and the machinations of megalomaniacs known today as Globalists. Most are not new revelations, but just the opposite; however , few will ever be found in the controlled press. There are literally thousands of such well-worn statements about the coming world government. We have selected some of the very best and well known. INVESTIGATOR'S NOTE: As the investigator will notic e not all of the quotes are documented as to date and place of utterance. This will trouble some. If this is a problem to the reader, he should either eliminate t hose quotes, or consider, as police investigators do, the great preponderance of eviden ce pointing toward a given hypothesis! In addition, as in other investigations , sometimes the investigator must look at the results to accurately check the validit y of the information one is receiving. This is to say, that many times we must look to see if what the statement purported would occur, ACTUALLY OCCURRED, in order to check and see if the original information received was valid. As the inv estigator will recognize, this same process used by law enforcement in proving the reli ability of a Confidential Informant (CI). The reader will readily see that wh at the undocumented statements listed in this publication exposed, or stated would occur in the future, has either occurred, or is in the process of taking place toda y. Therein lies the proof of the original statements and why they were chosen to be included in this publication. FACTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES FROM THEIR WORKS YOU WILL KNOW THEM. Here are their words and works, and some very important evidence (STAKES) to use to expose and \"kill off\" the World Government Vampires in our society. In addition to this are included other"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"pertinent materials (government maps, etc.) all of which revealed other parts of the same treasonous operation. With these facts in hand, our nation's internal pro tectors, police and National Guardsmen, will be able to alert even the most hard headed of our colleagues to understand that: VERY SOON, IF WE DO NOT STOP THESE WORLD GOVERNMENT PROPONENTS, AND INSTALL IN PLACES OF LEADERSHIP HON ORABLE MEN AND WOMEN, ALL MILITARY, NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND OFFICERS OF THE LAW WILL BE USED AS THE \"ENFORCEMEN T ARM\" TO GUARANTEE A FULL COMPLEMENT OF \"VOLUNTEERS\" FOR THESE IMPERIALISTS' \"PEACEFUL\" SOCIALIST GLOBAL SOCIETY. EXPOSURE IS THE DEATH KNELL OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER Investigating Officers always must demand proof of a crime. No assumptions can stand alone. Here are the confessions right from th e mouths of these parasites of liberty. Once armed with this information, our PLAN is simply for each officer to take this publication, make copies of it (or order more copies) and pass them out ASAP to every Police Officer and National Guardsmen he knows. All officers, for their own welfare, and in order to be of assistance , need these facts. Keep in mind that these global government Blood Suckers, just li ke the old movie Vampires, must do their dirty deeds in darkness. The purpose of th is publication is to bring that darkness to light! If we do this, the only other ac tivity we \"Police Against the New World Order\" need apply is to UPHOLD OUR OATH OF OF FICE. In other words, our duty is to protect the people and their rights under the U.S. and State Constitutions. We welcome every Internal Protector that loves libe rty and has taken an oath \"to protect our U.S. Constitution and the freedoms of t heir fellow countrymen\", to join us in SAYING \"NO\" TO THE NEW WORLD ORDER. WHAT \"NEW WORLD\"? Man's desire to rule the world is as old as his pre sence on the earth. The \"New\" World Order is actually the same old plan for world dominion. Biblical history itself shows this to be true. The tower of Babel was one s uch futile attempt by men to set up a ONE WORLD SOCIETY without God. And God Himself crushed it. Satan tempted even Jesus, promising Him world dominion as His reward. This same promise has been given to scores of other men over the ages. History tells of many who have accepted the Great Deceiver's terms. This diabolical quest has continued on through the 19th Century and into the 20th with national and world figures each successively making plans for world rule. Listed here are but a few of such"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"statements from many past decades up to the present . HOW SHALL WE KNOW? Some among us ask, \"How shall we know when tyranny has come to America's door? \"There are very few answers that our Founding Fathers failed to leave us regarding the proper and improper role of governmen t. Here is the answer to the question of how we shall recognize tyranny: \"SINGLE ACTS OF TYRANNY MAY BE ASCRIBED TO THE ACCI DENTAL OPINION OF A DAY; BUT A SERIES OF OPPRESSIONS, BEGU N AT A DISTINGUISHED PERIOD, AND PURSUED UNALTERABLY THROU GH EVERY CHANGE OF MINISTERS (ADMINISTRATIONS) TOO PLA INLY PROVES A DELIBERATE, SYSTEMATIC PLAN OF REDUCING US TO SLAVERY.\" - Thomas Jefferson. (Has tyranny come to America?) Another of our Founders said - \"WHEN THE GOVERNMENT FEARS THE PEOPLE THERE IS LIBERTY; WHEN THE PEOPLE FEAR THE GOVERNMENT THERE IS TYRANNY\". (There is no question at this time in our history that Americans fear their government.) THE FAMOUS AND INFAMOUS QUOTES Like the legendary Vampire Dracula lays claim to hi s victims, the Globalist slowly drains the essence of life and liberty from our Lan d. While it may be surprising to some, we will begin this overview of U.S. treason a nd debauchery with America's current, number one proponent of world conquest, Pr esident George Bush: GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH, President of U.S., CFR Director, Trilateralist, \"Lip-reader\", CIA Director. Bush, on e moonlit night in 1948 at Yale University, crawled naked into a coffin. With 15 br other \"Bonesmen\" (as they call one another) encircling him, he told personal tales of debauchery, took an occult oath, was raised (\"born-again\") as a MAN-GOD, jumpe d into a pile of mud, thus joining the occult, elitist Skull & Bones Society. He, indeed, is still a \"Boner\" today. Bush spoke before Congress on September 11, 1990, d elivering a speech which he entitled \"Toward a New World Order\". Addressing the subject of his Gulf War, he made his first public utterance of his, and his ric h cronies' plans for a world imperialism in stating that the war in Iraq was \".. .a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these tro ubled times...a new world order can emerge.\" Let us take a moment to compare the statements of t he \"Father of our Republic\" with those of Internationalist George \"Boner\" Bush: \"The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to for eign nations, is in extending our"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"commercial relations to have as little political co nnection as possible... Why, by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of E urope, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rival ships, interest, humor, or caprice?... It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent a lliances with any portion of the foreign world.\" - George Washington, September 19, 1796. (Which George should we follow?) Bush has given his New World Order (N.W.O.) pep tal ks at least 20 times over the last two years for various groups around the world. Space does not allow us to list all of these treasonous discourses; however, several mo re are listed further on in this report. NOTE: DON'T MISTAKE THIS \"BUSH BASHING\" AS ANTI- REPUBLICANISM! Many of our Officers are deeply involved in either the Socialist Republican Party or the Socialist Democratic Party. Both parties have p layed a large part in setting America on the course toward 3rd World Nation statu s. Bill Clinton's goals are identical to Bush's -A New World Order Imperialism. Perot's ideas for government are also pro-globalism. We can give Bush credit that his recent unabashed u tterances of his dream of a New World Order served to awaken at least a few slumber ing Americans. These Americans now understand that, what was long planne d and covertly implemented, is well on its way to fruition. Some will remember historical accounts of other megalomaniacs of the past who acted upon similar gl obal ambitions. Several of the following are relatively recent examples: ADAM WISEHOPHF, Professor at Germany's Ingolstadt U niversity, founded The Order of the Illuminati on May 1, 1776. This man de signed the very plan of world domination that is still in use today to enslave th e world's masses. Here, upon establishing his \"Order of the Illuminati\", he smug ly reflects on his \"conning\" the gullible Christians of his day, saying: \"The most wonderful thing of all is that the distin guished Lutheran and Calvinist theologians who belong to our order really believe that they see in it (Illuminati) the true and genuine sense of Christian Religion. Oh mo rtal man, is there anything you cannot be made to believe?\" Evidently not! And a high percentage of Christians today are still being conned in the same way. One prime example of this are the mil lions of Christians, and most church denominations, who have fallen for the N.W.O . plan of a \"One World RELIGION\", being spearheaded by the United Nations' National and World Counsel of Churches, behind the battle cry of ecumenicalism . Watch the future and we will see only small groups of spiritual Americans, who will"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"resist following the millions of \"religious\" lambs to the slaughter. The Lord of the Bible always warned His people to never follow the MULTITUDE. WORLD AND NATIONAL LEADERS POINT THE WAY Let us continue with statements from those who over the last few generations have recognized the One World conspiracy. BENJAMIN DISRAELI, Prime Minister of England, was a ttributed with this statement in 1844: \"The world is governed by very d ifferent personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes.\" WINSTON CHURCHILL, Prime Minister of England, state d to the London Press in 1922: \"From the days of Sparticus Wisehophf, Karl M arx, Trotski, Belacoon, Rosa Luxenburg, and Ema Goldman, this world conspiracy h as been steadily growing. This conspiracy played a definite recognizable role in the tragedy of the French revolution. It has been the mainspring of every sub versive movement during the 19th Century. And now at last this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and Americ a have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their head and have become th e undisputed masters of that enormous empire.\" JUSTICE FELIX FRANKFURTER, U.S. Supreme Court Justi ce: \"The real rulers in Washington are invisible and exercise power from be hind the scenes.\" JOHN F. HYLAN, Mayor of New York 1918 - 1925, said, \"The real menace of our Republic is the invisible government which like a g iant octopus sprawls its slimy legs over our cities states and nation.\" FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, U.S. President, in a letter written November 21, 1933 to Colonel E. Mandell House, Roosevelt states: \"The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government of the U.S. since the days of Andrew Jac kson.\" (History points to the last truly honorable and incorruptible American pre sident as Andrew Jackson \"Old Hickory\".) ROWAN GAITHER, President of the Ford Foundation, in 1954 lends proof to what we know to be fact today, namely that many of our P residents have been a knowing part of this World Conquest plot. Mr. Gaither state d to Congressional Reese Commission investigator Norman Dodd: \"We operate he re under directives which emulate from the White House... The substance of th e directives under which we operate is that we shall use our grant making power to alter life in the United states such that we can comfortably be merged with the Sov iet Union.\" (Ike was President at the time.) CARROLL QUIGLEY, Professor of History at Georgetown University, member of"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"the CFR (one of the U.S. Organizations dedicated to World Government) stated in his book \"Tragedy & Hope\": \"The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) is the American Branch of a society which originated in En gland...

Hundreds of our City, State and National p oliticians are members of this and other N.W.O. groups. Governor Clinton, for exam ple, attended Georgetown University and stated that his mentor, Professor Qu igley, taught him so many wonderful things. Since Governor Clinton and his wi fe are totally dedicated, International Socialists and N.W.O. promoters, perh aps Professor Quigley did have a great affect!) BARRY GOLDWATER, U.S. Senator (Arizona) in his book \"WITH NO APOLOGIES\" stated this about another Globalist grou p: \"The Trilateralist Commission is international...(and)...is intended t o be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interes ts by seizing control of the political government of the United States. The Tril ateralist Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and c onsolidate the four centers of power - POLITICAL, MONETARY, INTELLECTUAL, and ECCLESIAST ICAL.\" PETER HOAGLAND, Nebraska State Senator and Humanist , speaking on radio in 1983 with the great American Pastor and Patriot Eve rett Sileven said: \"Fundamental, Bible believing people do not have the right to ind octrinate their children in their religious beliefs because we, the state, are prepar ing them for the year 2000, when America will be part of a one-world global society and their children will not fit in.\" DAVID ROCKEFELLER, Internationalist billionaire, Hu manist, CFR kingpin, founder of the Trilateralist Commission, World Orde r Godfather (and in all probability the High School graduate voted \"Most Li kely to Be Hanged for Treason\"), voiced his praise of the controlled U.S. media for keeping their oath not to divulge the Globalist plans to the public. Speak ing to his fellow conspirators at a meeting, June 1991 in Baden Baden, Germany, of yet one more infamous World Order group, the Bilderbergers, Mr. Rockefeller sai d: \"We are grateful to the Washington Post, The New Yo rk Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have atten ded our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years .\" He went on to explain: \"It would have been impossible for us to develop ou r plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during th ose years. But, the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination pract iced in past centuries.\""},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"(It is not reported if the attendees kissed his rin g - or anything else - after their leader bestowed his blessing on those in attendance). Actu ally, we could ask Governor Clinton or Dan Quayle, both of whom were there. Bus h and Clinton are Bilderbergers, Internationalists, and their goals a re exactly the same for America. Let us repeat ...CLINTON'S, BUSH'S, AND PEROT'S, PL ANS FOR AMERICA ARE VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL. The Republicans and Democr ats goals for America are virtually identical. They both are taki ng our nation into global government. Globalist Mr. Dan Quayle was there at the June 91 m eeting being sized up as a possible Bilderberger U.S. Presidential contender f or 1996. The major media's job is to convince Americans that the Republicans and Demo crats are on opposite sides and fighting each other. JAMES PAUL WARBURG, Foreign Agent of the Rothschild Dynasty, major player in the Federal Reserve Act scam: on February 17, 19 50, while speaking before the United States Senate, this pompous Internationalist boasted confidently, \"We shall have World Government, whether or not we like it. T he only question is whether World Government will be achieved by conquest or co nsent.\" ROBERT KENNEDY, former U.S. Attorney General of the U.S.: \"All of us will ultimately be judged on the effort we have contribu ted to building a NEW WORLD ORDER.\" - 1967 (We can all agree with Robert on one thing: All traitors who participate in the N.W.O. WILL be judged one day!) THE WORLD MONEY POWERS The Global MONEY Vampires are in control of the fin ances of most of the world. Here are some statements of those who, past and pre sent, have been aware of that control: GEORGE W. MALLONE, U.S. Senator (Nevada), speaking before Congress in 1957, alluded to the families that secretly own the \"Federal\" Reserve Bank and control the finances of the U.S. He stated: \"I believe that if the people of this nation fully understood what Congress has done to them over the last 49 years, they would move on Washington; they would not wait for an election... It adds up to a preconceived pla n to destroy the economic and social independence of the United States!\" THOMAS JEFFERSON, U.S. President: \"I believe that b anking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armie s.

ONE LAST WORD ON THE MONEY VAMPIRES: Do we wonder w hy so many Americans are being sucked dry and are losing their homes, farms and businesses each week?

If any Officer doubts this after reading the preceding sta tements by the money parasites, it would be wise to consider this secret communique ci rculated among the leading U.S. Bankers only, way back in 1934, entitled, THE BANKERS' MANIFESTO \"Capital must protect itself in every way ...Debts must be collected and loans and mortgages foreclosed as soon as possible. When thro ugh a process of law the common people have lost their homes, they will be m ore tractable and more easily governed by the STRONG ARM OF THE LAW (Cops) applie d by the central power of leading financiers. People without homes will no t quarrel with their leaders. This is well known among our principle men now engaged i n forming an imperialism of capitalism to govern the world.

He re's one terrific example. John Swinton, the former Chief of Staff for the New York Times, was one of America's best loved newspapermen. Called by his peers \"The D ean of his Profession\", John was asked in 1953 to give a toast before the New Yo rk Press Club, and in so doing made a monumentally important and revealing stateme nt. He is quoted as follows: \"There is no such thing, at this date of the world' s history, in America as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you who dares to write your honest opinions, and if you did, you kno w beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my ho nest opinions out of the paper I am connected with.

Times fr om 1950 to 1960: \"The New York Times is deliberately pitched to the liber al (Socialist) point of view.\" WALTER CRONKITE: \"News reporters are certainly libe ral (Socialists) and left of center.\" BARBARA WALTERS: \"The news media in general are lib erals (socialists).\" We could go on, but I believe we get their point!

Subjects of expertise: New World Order, Occultism, Extreme Movements, Parapsychology. His assessment of the co ming N.W.O. under the United Nations is that it will reduce everything to one common denominator: \"The system will be made up of a single currency, s ingle centrally financed government, single tax system, single language, sin gle political system, single world court of justice, single head (one individual leade r), single state religion.\" He further states: \"Each person will have a registe red number, without which he will not be allowed to buy or sell; and there will be on e universal world church.

NEW -AGE PROFESSORS TEACH OUR CHILDREN'S TEACHERS Turning now to education, let's quote a few of the top U.S. spokesmen and professors in that field, to see the over-all philo sophy used to train our teachers, who then go on to prepare our children for the New Worl d Order. Dr. CHESTER PIERCE, Harvard University Professor, H umanist, New World Order Guru. This professor instructs teachers and those s tudents who aspire to become teachers of our children as follows: \"Every child in America who enters school at the ag e of five is mentally ill, because he comes to school with an allegiance to our instit utions, toward the preservation of this form of government that we have. Patriotism, n ationalism, and sovereignty, all that proves that children are sick because a truly well individual is one who has rejected all of those things, and is truly the inte rnational child of the future.\" Dr. PAUL BRANDWEIN, Leading U.S. child psychologist . This man also instructs teachers on how to recognize mental disability in o ur school children. He states: \"Every child who believes in God is mentally ill.\" (All government schools have a psychologist.) Dr. SIDNEY SIMON, Lecturer, Educator who some say s pecializes in encouraging"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"immoral and criminal activities in youths. He instr ucts teachers as follows: \"We do not need any more preaching about right or w rong. The old 'thou shall nots' simply are not relevant.\" Further he says, \"Values clarification is a method for teachers to change the values of children without g etting caught.\" HUMANIST CURRICULUM: Along with these \"Humanist Wac kos\" training our nation's teachers to be \"change agents\" for their N ew World Order, there is the matter of the literature that they have for teacher s to use to instruct American children. One such book entitled \"Weep for Our Chil dren\", might explain to Police Officers a great deal about why the crime rates in school age children are skyrocketing. Consider this one passage touting the humanistic \"Values Clarification/Situation Ethics\" program: \"It's OK to lie. It's OK to steal. It's OK to have premarital sex. It's OK to cheat or to kill if these things are part of your value system, and you clarified these values for yourself. The important thing is not what values yo u choose, but that you have chosen them for yourself and without coercion of pa rents, spouse, priest, friends, ministers or social pressure of any kind.\" This type of values/moral code (or lack thereof!) i s all to evident in American Schools today, as many Police Officers know. Many o fficers write expressing alarm at seeing this type of unholy \"Situation Ethics\" in struction so wide-spread in our nation's schools. PSYCHIATRISTS LEAD THE WAY For decades, it has been the job of those within th e psychology field to introduce to the American Public the idea that those who believe in God are sick and must be \"enlightened\" or eliminated, and that \"immorality\" is the only path to the NEW AGE. And indeed it is. The several quotes below wil l drive home this well planned scenario. BERTRAND RUSSELL, philosopher, educator and atheist : \"I think the subject which will be of most importance politically is Mas s Psychology. ...It's importance has been enormously increased by the growth of mode rn methods of propaganda ...Although this science will be diligently studied , it will be rigidly confined to the governing class (Elite). The populace will not be a llowed to know how its convictions were generated.\" One of the great Psychiatric Gurus of Mental Health speaks: Dr. G. BROCK CHISHOLM, First head of the World Fede ration of Mental Health (another N.W.O. group.) \"What basic psychological d istortion can be found in every civilization of which we know anything? The only ps ychological force capable of producing these perversions is morality - the concept of right and wrong. The re -"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"interpretation and eventual eradication of the conc ept of right and wrong are the belated objectives of nearly all of psychotherapy.\" \"The pretence is made that to do away with right an d wrong would produce uncivilized people, immorality, lawlessness, and so cial chaos. The fact is that most psychiatrists and psychologists and other respected people have escaped from moral chains and are able to think freely.\" Taken from th e updated book, NONE DARE CALL IT TREASON, by J.A. Stormer Police Officers have been among the first to notice that such teachings have produced exactly the results he (the good Doctor) s aid they would not produce. He lied. There is no greater promoter of change than F EAR, and no greater creator of fear than chaos and lawlessness throughout a nation . The enemy of our system knows that immorality breeds chaos and lawlessness. Chaos and lawlessness breads fear in the people and when fearful enough the peop le will accept any solution. Guess what the solution is? We agree with Dr. Chisholm, that most of these mini ons of \"psychobabble\" have truly \"escaped\" from any and all moral foundation i n their lives. Anything their patients dream up is perfectly okay and encouraged by most such \"professionals\". This \"there is no right or wrong\" psycho-babble is what is being drilled into the heads of those American school children whose paren ts have unfortunately placed them in Government Indoctrination Centers which we erroneously call our \"educational\" system. In case any officer reading this publication thinks that this change in the morals of our nation is accidental, he or she must read the b ook, \"THE SOVIET ART OF BRAINWASHING - A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psycho-politics\", written by Kenneth Goff. In this book, Goff, a one time dues-paying member of the Communist Party, writes: \"During my training I was trained in Psycho-politics. This was the art of capturing the minds of a nation thro ugh brainwashing and fake mental health.\" Kenneth Goff paid a high price for his efforts to a lert the American people. After attempting to inform America of Marxist-trained Psy chologists being placed inside the U.S. to change the morals and beliefs of our na tion, he mysteriously died from poisoning in 1943. His farewell in his book says: \" This manual of the Communist Party should be in the hands of every loyal America n, that they may be alerted to the fact that it is not always by armies and guns that a nation is conquered.\" In this book is found an address by Beria, the Head of the Lenin School of Psycho-politics. His 1933 address to a group of American/Marxist Psychol ogy students is most revealing. Speaking to this group who would be returning to pl y their treachery in the U.S. he says: \"A psycho - politician must work hard to produce the maximum ch aos in the fields of"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"'mental healing.' You must work until every teacher of psychology unknowingly or knowingly teaches only Communist doctrine under the guise of 'psychology.' You must labor until every doctor and psychiatrist is e ither a psycho-politician or an unwitting assistant to our aims.

You must work until suicide arising from mental imbalance is common and calls forth no general investigation or remark... You must dominate as res pected men the fields of psychiatry and psychology. You must dominate the ho spitals and universities... You can come and take your instructions as worshippers of Freud... Psycho-politics is a solemn charge. With it you can erase our enemies as insects. You (psychologists) can change their (leaders) loya lties by psychopolitics. Given a short time with a psycho-politician you can alter f orever the loyalty of a soldier in our hands or a statesman or a leader in his own cou ntry, or you can destroy his mind. Use the courts, use the judges, use the Constitutio n of the country, use its medical societies and its laws to further our ends... By ps ycho-politics create chaos. Leave a nation leaderless. Kill our enemies. And bring to E arth, through Communism, the greatest peace man has ever known. Thank you.\" (This is only part of Beria's speech to the visitin g American psychology students.) NOTE: Everything he asked these students to accompl ish when they returned to practice their \"art\" in our nation has occurred. An d now we can look forward to that \"peace\" he promised under the U.N. New World Order. WHAT IS THIS THING CALLED \"PEACE\"? JOSEPH STALIN stated that after Communism succeeds \" ...then, there will come a peace across the earth.\" KARL MARX said \" ...the meaning of peace is the abs ence of opposition to Socialism.\" THE LORD GOD said, \"...they have seduced my people, saying PEACE; and there was NO PEACE.\" (Ezekiel 13:10) St. PAUL said, \"For when they shall say, 'PEACE and SAFE- TY', then sudden destruction comes upon them, as travail upon a wome n with child; and they shall not escape.\" (I Thes. 5:3) We should note that the Globalists' main tactic and motivation to entice the world's people into their United Nations trap is ultimate \" PEACE and SAFETY\".

PLAN WORKING PERFECTLY So far we have put the spotlight on a good many New World Order BLOOD SUCKERS -- obvious spies, seditionists, traitors, - - some of them Americans, some foreign. There is an important, underlying factor i n all this that must not be missed: The Global conspirators, along with thousands of th eir world government \"comrades\" in the U.S. have been deliberately whipp ing the American public into a fearful frenzy. With just the \"right\" manipulations, they have been successfully conditioning our people to see all our societal systems; governmenta l, political, educational, penal, ecological, etc., as completely out of control. Thi s is not true. Let us not be fooled. All of these areas are comple tely under their control and have been for decades. They are functioning just as well as the enemy wish es them to function. Remember a; what Rowan Gaither, head of Ford Foundation said (in the \"Famous and Infamous Quotes\" section of this publication), the task is t o \"covertly lower the standard of living, the whole social structure, of America so t hat we can be MERGED with all other nations.\" FACT: Their parasitic PLAN to cause this total (con trolled) breakdown is \"right on course\". The American system is collapsing \"on time \", and just as programmed. Remember what FDR said, \"In politics nothing happen s by accident. If it happened, you can bet it was planned that way.\" The plan of these globalists is that when America, the last \"holdout\", is brought to its knees, the American \"sheep\" will beg their new god (GOVERNMENT) to save them!

And of course, you can't ask for assistanc e and protection from your own country's government because as we all hav e been told, \"no individual nation could possibly stand a chance in defense against this obviously 'superior' Race from space. AH, but isn't it wonderful that \"salvation\" is only a one-world government away?! • A second twist to this planned scenario is: These \" cute little space things\" are our BOSOM BUDDIES; they bring tidings of good will, and come \"conveniently\" to SAVE our world from the brink of total destruction! \"Isn't that precious?!\" In other words, this particular plan is to convince gullible Americans that anyone or anything (but that Jesus Christ \"guy\"), WILL SAVE O UR WORLD!

Consider it possible that those who promote the N.W .O. plan are presently involved in a \"trial run\" of all three of the above describe d UFO scenarios. Such plans are being promoted by the Globalists, among those whom they consider to be the \"Wacko\", \"Radical\", \"Extremist\", Nationalist, Pro-A merican organizations, in order to test which scenario is more acceptable. For exam ple, pick any one of the three scenarios below: 1. The evil little devils from outer space, who wil l dissect, destroy or devour us all. 2. The sweet, funny, little COSMIC critters who, li ke our government, are only \"HERE TO HELP YOU!\" And lastly, for the gullible religious masses: 3.

Mencken said, \"To die for an idea: it is unquestionable noble. Bu t how much nobler it would be if men died for ideas that were true.\" Officers are told the reason the guns have to be re moved from the American People is to stop crime and the killing of the innocent. T his is a fabrication. Truthfully, the only reason the guns must be removed is to stop any chance of our countrymen raising up and throwing off the \"wonderful\" program s that their \"philanthropic\" government leaders have planned for them. It is time to seriously consider what each of us wi ll do when these Global elitists in our government instruct OFFICERS and NATIONAL GUARD SMEN to go forth and take the guns away from the armed, good people of your city or town ...\"FOR THEIR OWN GOOD\". Most Officers know the day will co me when they will have to make that very hard decision on this gun removal issue. The evidence is all around us that this day is near. Consider the imperialist N.W.O. position. For the W orld Elite to truly enjoy their \"utopian\" Socialist Society, the subject masses mus t not have the a means to protect themselves against more \"voluntary compliance\". Whe n one grasps this logical position, there is no longer any question about it: THE GUNS WILL HAVE TO GO. IF THERE ARE ANY Officers who still doubt this, we are about to prove this planned scenario to you. Keep in mind that the seco nd part of the three-part plan of the N.W.O. Regional Government program (which prece des the One World Government) is that Canada, USA, Mexico and South a nd Central America are to be combined into one Region. Hence, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is on FAST-TRACK with the backing of our no torious N.W.O. President, N.W.O. Congressmen, Senators and Governors. The oth er 2 parts presently in the works are: First part - the uniting of the European Nations (Common Market ), and"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"#3 - the uniting of the Asian Nations. These make u p the \"TRI\" [3] parts of the Tri- lateral One World Government. Understanding this well planned program will make t he following \"PERSONAL PROTECTION\" proclamation more clear to any doubting bobbies. The following is a recent declaration from the gove rnment of Australia, which is a member of the British commonwealth. The Canadians, our soon to be northern countrymen, are also a British Commonwealth. Questi on: When we are merged with the British Commonwealth by the Elitist N.W.O. Para sites will we assume these British Socialist antigun laws or will they assume ours? LEGAL NOTICE-- PERSONAL PROTECTION IS NO REASON TO HAVE A GUN If you own a gun which you keep to protect yourself , your family, or your property, you must dispose of it legally. Under the latest gu n laws, personal and property protection are no longer considered acceptable reas ons to possess any type of firearm, or to get a license. If you wish to posses s any gun, you must have a license and meet the new requirements for safe storage of t he weapon and its ammunition. When your current license expires you must reapply if you want to continue to possess or use a gun. Be warned, making a false or misleading statement on your license application could earn you ten years in pri son. Act quickly, if you haven't got a license, now is the time to either apply for one, or legally dispose of your gun. One way you can do this is at your local police station . Possession and use of any firearm for personal or property protection is illegal and will attract severe penalties. No exceptions, no excuses.

Every officer knows such people in the community, i .e. those \"good\" citizens who are too scared to oppose anything their government tells them to do. Yes, even if they know it's wrong, they will go alo ng or just keep their mouths shut. Every captive nation has a large percentage of such people. These are the \"production units\" (PU's) that will fit very well i nto the New World Order. They are ready made slaves. As strange as it may seem, many of these \"sheep\" st ill believe that they can trust and believe in our government to SAVE THEM from anarchy . This is amusing to some of our government officials and Police Officers. It amazes them that these people are so unaware of what is happening and continue trusti ng the same government that has planned and promoted the anarchy in the streets in the first place precisely to scare them into submission. (See Aid & Abet Police Newsle tter 2-2.) L.A. RIOTS - AN ORCHESTRATION. A prime example was the recent L.A. riots. The beat ing of King was not part of the plan, but it offered a grand opportunity to accompl ish three important things for the Globalists. 1) Get rid of Chief Gates, who for years had stood in the way of Socialist - N.W.O. gang member, Tom Bradley and others involved in try ing to get the L.A. Police Department into the coming national police force. (See soon to be released book, THE CENTRALIZATION OF U.S. POLICE POWERS , available from U.S. Federal Law Research Center, P.O. Box 8712, Phoenix Arizona 85066.) 2) Further convince the People that their only salv ation from crime and evil in society will be found in the \"protection\" provided by a global government. 3) A grand opportunity for Globalists George, Pete and Tom to practice FEMA style Martial Law. It matters little that some among the masses have to die. Remember, the new government philosophy is the same as that o f the Communist, \"THE END DOES INDEED JUSTIFY THE MEANS.\" Once again, the masses were to think that everythin g was out of control. It was not (the riots were planned). But it was a good enough reason that in a matter of hours, 2,000 U.S. Marines were on the streets of an Americ an city. This was a very"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"important test. A most severe breach of Constitutio nal law was brought to bear; and more importantly, the people said nothing. The mass es complained only that the government should have acted sooner and in greater strength. For, when there is anarchy in the streets the \"sheep\" do not care who saves them. This planned Martial Law scenario actually worked out better than the N. W.O. social planners ever expected. DETECTIVE BROWN SPEAKS OUT Los Angeles County Sheriff's Detective Larry Brown speaking in Phoenix, Arizona August 1992 stated that there was more behind the r iots than the public knows. He revealed that known agitators from the Revolutionar y Communist Party (RCP), Socialist Worker's Party (SWP), Progressive Labor P arty (PLP) Socialist Organizing Network (SON), were there to press for a riot befor e it started and some members of these organizations participated in the rioting, lo oting, and arson. He said that Mayor Bradley gave a very inflammatory statement that was broadcast on L.A. TV before the riots. He states, what many P olice Officers already know, that Mayor Bradley has strongly supported the Communist Party USA since he first ran for mayor. Also, he received support from the ACLU, and National Lawyers Guild (Both pro-Communist groups.) In his 1969 bid to bec ome mayor his political manager was Communist Party functionary Don Rothenb erg. Gus Hall, the Director of the Communist Party USA came to L.A. to tell the Communists to help elect Bradley. Some of our fellow Officers in Southern California believe, after evaluation of the evidence and results, that the outcome of the trial was planned by certain government officials and carried out with precision by the jud ge and prosecutor. We believe they are right. How did they manipulate the jury? (Read Aid & Abet Police Newsletter Vol. 1 Num. 10, that addresses the science of how t his is accomplished.) There is no doubt that it was understood what a NOT GUILTY verd ict would accomplish. But, that's another story. (See Aid & Abet Vol. 2, Num. 1 and Num. 2., which covers other parts of this incredible well-laid plan for c reating anarchy in the streets and TERROR in the hearts of U.S. citizens. The goal? To get the citizens to give up their Bill of Rights so that their government can make th e streets \"safe again\" through global government.) BACK TO \"GETTING THEM GUNS!\" Officers should keep in mind that some of the guns are not going to be easily removed. For instance, those owned by true patriots those freedom-loving Americans who know, without a doubt, what's coming next if th ey give up their guns. It should not be a surprise to Police Officers that many good Americans will not walk meekly into NEW WORLD ORDER slavery. And there are few Off icers who would want it any other way."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"So the question each Officer individually must face is a very difficult but realistic one: \"Which way will your own gun face when the ord ers are issued? \" Will you protect the people you have sworn to protect? Or, w ill you do what other patriotic officers from other countries have done to their co untrymen, \"obediently just follow orders\"? Every Police Officer/Military soldier in every ensl aved nation on earth has had to face this same question. Certainly, it's an individ ual decision whether or not to take lethal action against fellow countrymen when ordere d to take their weapons (and with them their liberty). But, each Officer will ma ke that decision. OFFICER, WILL YOU KILL FELLOW COUNTRYMEN WHEN ORDER ED TO TAKE THEIR WEAPONS? Perhaps it will help that you w ill be told by superiors, \"It's for the national good\", and/or, \"It's for the good of society.\" (History proves that the nations' Enforcers can expect some such motivat ional indoctrination such as this.) Could there be such a police action, taken against the public, if the police were told the truth, i.e. \"that officers should take the guns and liberties from the masses so that the Controlling Elite of the nation can enslave the m\"? We think not. Why not? Because national Police Enforcers are not mercenaries; they are always highly patriotic and would not do such a thing as e nslaving their countrymen, unless in some manner they were totally convinced that it was the only thing to do to save the country, \"the patriotic\" thing to do... \"FOR TH E GOOD OF THE COUNTRY\" don't you know! \"CRIMINALS\" EVERY ONE Actually, it may not be a difficult decision for so me Police Officers and National Guardsmen, because before it comes time to take the guns, all these terrible, \"radical RESISTERS with those nasty guns\" will have been bra nded as \"CRIMINALS OF THE STATE\". And as you and I know, we have been tra ined that there is little wrong with killing an armed and resisting \"criminal \". RIDICULOUS? Have you ever wondered exactly how governments throughout re cent history have gotten local and state Police Officers in other enslaved nations to participate in executing their own citizens. This is accomplished by labeling them \"criminals\". (Piece of Cake!) It is not a figment of someone's imagination that t housands of unarmed fathers, mothers and children have been shot to death by the ir local police, while attempting to run or climb to freedom. It is through a process of indoctrination that the very best Officers, highly patriotic Officers, are brought to the point mentally where they can be counted on to do such things. Remember, it is al ways accomplished by convincing the best officers: \"It is a necessary an d patriotic thing to do.\""},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"PATRIOTIC AMERICANS WILL FIGHT TO THE DEATH Police officers would do well not to see the above title as only part of the script out of a John Wayne movie. We should consider, with utmost seriousness, that i f good Americans (including internal protectors) allow this plan of the Globali sts to get this far, it can be expected that casualties among Police Officers, National Gua rdsmen, and armed \"criminal\" patriotic citizens will be very high before the gun removal process can be successfully completed. (If indeed it can be comple ted.) But, with Police Officers and Guardsmen serving as the \"cannon fodder\" to enf orce the Globalist plan, these deaths will be merely \"acceptable loses\" to those g iving the orders and looking down from their safe and secure Ivory Towers. It is therefore entirely relevant that our brothers and sisters decide very soon which side they will serve in the setting up of this \"Uto pian\" Global Society. They must not be fooled by government officials that claim that a ll men and women with American blood running through their veins will walk gently into lifelong servitude. It cannot be contradicted that a great many out the re on the other end of those half- billion \"liberty teeth\" (guns) still underscore the statement of J.J.

On th e other hand, the vast majority of government \"leaders\", \"educators\" and m edia persons apparently don't!

Without learning, men are incapable of knowing their rights, ...Dr. Benjamin Rush - 1786: We should recall, from the section entitled \"New-Ag e Professors\", what Dr. Chester Pierce, Harvard University Professor, Humanist, New World Order Guru instructs teachers and those students who aspire to become te achers of our children, namely: \"Every child in America who enters school at the ag e of five is mentally ill, because he comes to school with an allegiance to our instit utions, toward the preservation of this form of government that we have. Patriotism, n ationalism, and sovereignty, all that proves that children are sick because a truly well individual is one who has rejected all of those things, and is truly the inte rnational child of the future.\" Once we gain an understanding of the \"money issue\", it is not difficult to understand how N.W.O. promoters gained control of our institut ions of higher learning where public school teachers, who taught us and are now t eaching our children, got their training. I can assure you that we, and our children, did not reject \"allegiance to our institutions ...Patriotism, nationalism, and sovere ignty.\" But we were never taught the doctrines of the freedom principles upon which this nation was founded. Instead, we were indoctrinated with Socialist doctrines, rei nforced by a controlled media. Most of our teachers did not do this consciously. T he teachers themselves did not determine what was to be taught to our children, th ey just went along to get along. [Like many of us are still doing.. And, those few w ho had enough insight to protest were quietly removed from the school system. Fortunately, we can quickly remedy that situation.

As one writer put it, \"These documents are the Scri ptures of our American Heritage of liberty and freedom.\" Starting with the Declarat ion of Independence, we learn their source and purpose. They are the laws derived from the \"Laws of Nature and Nature's God\" that circumscribe the limitations of power and authority entrusted to the men in government. As such, they are the legal basis by which America citizens, as individuals, are to judge whether or not those b ounds have been exceeded or if Government has become destructive of the ends for w hich it was instituted. First, there is natural law which stands as an eter nal rule to all men, and which is to govern even the government itself. The laws of nature are call ed the laws of God"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"because they are derived from the same source. It i s called the Common Law because it is Common to all men, at all times, and in all places. It sets the bounds of all men including the men in government who possess no powers not delegated by the people themselves. And the people can not deleg ate powers they themselves do not possess. Therefore, if an individual cannot per form an act without committing a crime, trespass or tort; then he cannot delegate th at authority to his representatives in government. It is this which sets the bounds of gov ernment. Second, government power is only a fiduciary power which has been established by the people only to act for certain ends. Yet, there remains in the people a supreme power to remove the men in government and alter the government itself when they find that they are acting contrary to the trust rep osed in them. These are the basic principles which are concisely stated in the Declaration of Independence, and which inform us of the ends for w hich our governments and constitutions were established. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all m en are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable R ights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.

It was the only Government the world has ever seen that was founded upon the \" Laws of Nature and of Nature's God\" and instituted for the sole and exclusive purp ose of securing and protecting God Given inalienable rights. The Constitution was purposely designed to place strict limitations upon Government to insure that i t did not stray from this purpose and become like all the other Governments the world has known. It was not instituted to grant rights and privileges, to regul ate the lives and rule over its citizens. It was not empowered to pass and enforce any law it deemed good.

Unde r the \"Laws of Nature and of Nature's God\", \"all men are created equal\" and no i ndividual and no group of individuals calling themselves a \"democracy\" or \"go vernment\" have a moral or legal right to invade another's rights to life, liberty a nd property - either themselves or through their representatives. Absolute, arbitrary power over the lives, liberty a nd property of freemen exists nowhere in a republic, not even in the largest majo rity. - Wyoming Declaration of Rights Art. I, Sec. 7 This identically worded provision can also be found in the Kentucky Declaration of Rights - Art. I, Sec. 2. This provision goes much d eeper than it appears on the surface and is worthy of careful reflection. As to both the accusation of being a \"Constitutiona l Purist\" and the Statement that the Constitution is a \"Living or elastic document,\" we can let the following answer for us: In the words of the Father of his Country, we decla re that... \"the constitution which at any time exists, till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all.\" - Rhode Island De claration of Rights Article I, Section I If we study these documents in the light of this pr ovision of the Rhode Island Declaration of Rights, we will begin to see just ho w far America has strayed from the basic and fundamental freedom principles upon w hich it was founded. We will find that a great deal in our constitutions that ha s never been changed by \"an explicit and authentic act of the whole people\" is totally i gnored today. The question we should ask is, by what authority were they changed? I would strongly suggest that as we study these doc uments, we keep the following key words uppermost in mind: \"Supreme Law\" and \"Sac redly Obligatory\". We"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"should also make a special effort to fully understa nd the following provision that will be found in many other State Constitutions. That frequent recurrence to fundamental principles, ...are absolutely necessary to preserve the blessings of liberty, and (to) keep go vernment free; the people ...have a right, in a legal way, to exact a due and constant regard to them, from their Legislators and magistrates, in making and executin g ...laws - Vermont Declaration of Rights Article 18th. Carefully note the words \"absolutely necessary\". Th e question becomes, how can we possibly \"preserve the blessings of liberty, and ke ep government free\" and \"exact a due and constant regard to them (fundamental princi ples) from ...legislators and magistrates ...\" if we are apathetically ignorant o f what those principles are? The answer, of course, is that we can't. From this, we can see the priceless value of these documents and the urgent need to study and distribu te them to others. This brings up another critically important topic r elative to these documents. Modern propaganda and legal practice has it that you must be a Licensed Lawyer before you are qualified to understand the \"legal meaning\" or \"interpretation\" of our laws and, therefore, the provisions in these documents which are the foundation of all of our laws; and, thereby to, demand a due observation and constant regard of them by our legislators, magistrates and other public officials . Some of us have even been accused of the \"crime\" of practicing law without a license when we have attempted to help others defen d their rights. This is a throw back to the Dark Ages where the layman could have n o intercourse with God's laws save through the intermediary of priests who were q ualified members of the clergy in good standing with the hierarchy. Today, the only d ifference is that those \"intermediaries\" between citizen \"laymen\" and the \" Laws\" are called lawyers and their \"superiors in Black Robes\" are called judges, and their courts of Chancery are pretending to be courts of law. I can assure you that the great majority of the fou nding stock of this nation who demanded and insisted that Bills of Rights be attac hed to their Constitutions were not lawyers and that they fully understood the limits o f the powers they were entrusting to the men in government. In fact, in many Colonies , lawyers were considered vermin and parasites, and were even banished in som e of them. This is such a critically important topic that we s hould inquire further into the thought of the Revolutionary generation. In effect, John Locke who was considered the ideological progenitor of the American Revoluti on and who, by far, was the most often non-biblical writer quoted by our Founding Fa thers said - any single man must judge for himself whether circumstances warrant obe dience or resistance to the commands of the civil magistrate; we are all qualif ied, entitled, and morally obliged to evaluate the conduct of our rulers. This politic al judgment, moreover, is not simply or primarily a rig ht, but like self - preservation, a duty to God. As such it is a"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"judgment that men cannot part with according to the God of Nature. It is the first and foremost of our inalienable rights without which we can preserve no other. To this idea, that has been propagated by the legal profession for so many years now that only lawyers and judges are qualified to under stand and interpret the \"legal meaning\" of our laws, let's examine the statement o f one of this nation's ideological Founding Fathers: To say that subjects [WE The People] in general are not proper judges (of the law) when their governors oppress them and play the tyra nt, and when they defend their rights ...is as great a treason as ever a man utter ed. Tis treason not against one single man, but against the state - against the whole body politic; tis treason against man- kind; tis treason against Common sense; tis treason against God; And this impious principle lays the foundation for justifying all th e tyranny and oppression that ever any prince was guilty of. The people know for what end they set up and maintain their governors, and they are the proper judges whe n governors execute their trust as they ought to do it. - Johnathan Mayhew It is clear that this \"impious principle\" perpetrat ed by a self serving legal profession is not recognized by Americans because they have ne ver learned the essential principles of liberty and free government. The impl ementation of this principle has created an Aristocratic form of government contrary to the Constitution. Under the pretense of a merger of law and equity, \"law\" has b een replaced by \"equity\" administered by self-appointed \"Aristocrats\" who ar e the only ones qualified to judge the law. Jurors are not lawyers. So, they are told they can only determine the facts in a case but are required to accept the law as the ju dge (aristocrat) gives it to them even if it violates their own conscience. ...the jury in all criminal cases, shall be the jud ges of the law and the facts. - Georgia, Declaration of Rights, Art.I, Sec.II, Para. I This provision appears in many of these documents. Yet, jurors, ignorant of freedom principles, allow judges to deny them and the defen dant the right to have the jury determine the law.Defendants are not even allowed t o argue Constitutional principles to the jury because they are not \"qualified\" to kno w and understand the \"legal meaning\" and \"interpretation\" of the law. In other words they are not \"proper judges\" of the law. I believe there are more instances of the abridgmen t of freedoms of the people by gradual and silent encroachment of those in power t han by violent and sudden usurpations. -James Madison \"Without learning, men are incapable of knowing the ir rights ...\" Therefore, they are incapable of recognizing these \"gradual and silent encroachments\" on their freedoms and liberties."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"It was well known during America's Revolutionary pe riod that Government was not the source of rights. It wasn't just Thomas Jeffers on who claimed that men \"are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable R ights,\" he merely restated what everyone was thinking. Kings or parliaments could not GIVE THE RIGHTS ESSE NTIAL TO HAPPINESS ...We claim them from a higher source - from the Ki ng of Kings, and Lord of all the earth. They are not annexed to us by parchments and seals. They are created in us by the decrees of Providence. John Dickerson - 1766 As we continue to examine these documents, we will begin to understand that our Founding Fathers placed the responsibility for the future fate of our Republic directly into the hands of the people as there was no other safe repository. It was left to the people themselves, as individuals, to preserve the integrity of the principles of liberty and free government. The duty and obligation to scrutinize the \"laws of nature\" and the laws contained herein which flowed from them for the knowledge req uisite for preserving our legacy of freedom and liberty is not merely optiona l on our part, it is \"absolutely necessary to preserve the blessings of liberty, and keep government free\" as we saw in the Vermont Bill of Rights. America was established as a nation of laws and not of men. And the laws contained herein are those laws. America's traditions do not have a life of their own. They must be sustained by living commitments. People must giv e them life continuously or they will expire especially when they are under attack a s they are today. In summary, the problem is not that we have forgott en freedom principles, but that the great majority of us have never learned them. I t is my fervent hope that this program will make a contribution toward rectifying that situation.

So we must ask our fellow Officers again, \"Will they be like those who have used pathetic statements such as, 'WELL, IT'S THE LAW, SO I HAVE NO CHOICE B UT TO ENFORCE IT.\" As many Officers know, that has been the lame excus e offered by the People's \"Protectors\" in all the Marxist nations of the worl d during the last 75 years of totalitarian rule. Fine, dedicated, HIGHLY PATRIOTIC (and brainwashed) police officers by the millions UPHELD THE \"LAW\" in these other countries, and went on to round up and execute 170 million of their own countrymen bec ause they were told by their leaders that \"to save their nation\" they must do th ese things. HOW COULD THEY DO THAT? Every time a nation's offic ers have committed such acts against their own people it was because o f their deep patriotism that they were easily brainwashed into believing these types of activities were in their nation's best interest. (Of course, as mentioned earlier, th ese 170 million people were labeled \"CRIMINALS\" of the state.) \"BUT I WAS ONLY FOLLOWING ORDERS\", has always been the most popular \"last words\" of obedient government officers. Least we forget Nuremberg! \"BUT, IT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE\", some will say. Let me tell you that it is already happening here, and many officers know it. It is no w well known that Governor Pete Wilson has just declared 500,000-plus good American s to be \"felons\"- CRIMINALS OF THE STATE- for not obeying his unconstitutional gun restrictions by March 30th of 1992.

WILL OUR \"OPERATION VAMPIRE KILLER 2000\" PLAN WORK? WHO ARE YOU?"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"By Officer A. Rick Dalton Fellow Officer: Have you ever considered just who y ou are? Do you realize that you are the \"thin blue line\" between civilized society and lawlessness? You have been entrusted with the collective right to self-protect ion for thousands of American citizens who depend on you. You and I are, in our o wn sphere of operations and influence, among the most important and powerful pe ople on earth! We have had awesome given to us, and we must never forget that we are, first and foremost, DEFENDERS, not PUNISHERS of the people. W e must honor and hold sacred the God-given rights of the people which we defend. And we must use our influence, our discretion and some times our author ity to protect these inalienable rights. Our plan to shut down the Establishment's N.W.O. Sl ave State by reeducating and returning the patriotic People's Servants and Prote ctors to the side of the People is working as we speak. Here is a fine example. A PERSONAL TESTIMONY Let this old cop relate one of many recent, memorab le meeting I've had with fellow patriot Police Officers and Guardsmen. I was a gues t speaker at the Seattle, Washington Preparedness Expo in 1991, which drew a crowd of 5,000-plus concerned Americans. At each of my talks there were many fine federal, state and local police officers and military persons in the a udience. I was privileged to meet a number of these good patriot Officers and to be abl e to speak with them after my speeches. I recall in particular two Officers who worked as p artners for the local police department. I can't tell you how impressed I was wi th their expression of their love for their fellow Americans and their country. They promised me that they would go forward from the Expo, study and share their knowle dge and concerns with their police colleagues. As the reader will soon see, the y did exactly that. Read below the first published article written by these two grand American Police Officers, and addressed to their peers. WE HAVE THE POWER Officers A.J. Seitz and Mike Lewis Puyallup Police Department, WA. Mike writes: When A.J. and I first informed people that we were going to start writing an article"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"on the U.S. Constitution, we received mixed respons es. Some of our fellow officers were sharpening their pencils preparing to write a rebuttal until they saw the piece (no, not A.J.'s HK-91. I'm talking about the articl e.) The article was primarily written as an opening statement just to get the ball rollin g and hopefully make people probe into their beliefs and ideals. Several comments were made as to whether we wore wh ite hoods when we wrote the article. We neither support nor condone the activit ies of the K.K.K. nor any other similar organization. What we do believe in is the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. This is something that every officer has sw orn to protect and serve. Yet, it's amazing the number of people, officers included, th at really don't know what the Bill of Rights contain and where it is applicable in the field of Law Enforcement. How many of you can recite the first, second, fourth, f ifth, sixth and the eighth amendments if asked by a citizen? These listed are primarily used in our profession. Of course, we all have some idea that freedom of sp eech, religion and search and seizure are in there somewhere, but most are not ex actly sure what else is in there. We all know that the Constitution and Bill of Right s supersedes all other laws. It gives the people the right to govern themselves as they see fit. It was our founding fathers' goal to not have a totalitarian state such as England. How many of us have been dismayed over the passage of a new law, with t he knowledge that the act would not be practical on the street, or just does not so und quite legal? All we do is bitch or enforce it unquestioned. It goes no further than th at. We as a people (especially police officers) have a great amount of power. Let' s begin to use it! We want you only to have an open mind, which for some will be t ough, I know. Do something for yourself. LIFE MAGAZINE has a special Fall edition solely based on the Bill of Rights. Take one home (Well, pay for it first!) and read it. You'd be surprised at what you find. Plus it will be great for your kids' futu re history papers. All we ask is that you search your own soul and question yourself if y ou are upholding the people's right, or are you upholding the Federal and State L egislative wishes. A.J. writes: As Officer Lewis said above, some people, including officers, feel that when a person uses the Bill of Rights as supportive materi al to an argument on a social issue, then the person must be a radical. Perhaps if you a re pro-government control, I guess you're right. However, were our founding fathers ra dicals against the English government when they were fighting for our freedom? Since we are discussing the right of the people to govern themselves, fellow of ficers label us \"right wing extremists\". This brings us top the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or the press, or the right of the people to peaceably assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\" This has been said to be the cornerstone of all other ri ghts, yet this right seems to be constantly under attack by politicians who owe alle giance to special interest groups,"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"as in the political correctness issue. This has obviously irritated the citizens of this c ountry, which can be seen by the recent election across the nation, where several sp ecial interest politicians were voted out of office, and in our own state where term limi tation nearly passed. One of the reasons that the government is in this s tate (excessive taxation, creating tighter government control, and any of the other to pics people complain about) is that the people have little knowledge about the his tory of our government. One example is the Sedition law. In 1797, John Adams, a Federalist, beat Thomas Jefferson, a Republican, by three votes for the pre sidency. In 1798, Jefferson and Madison opposed an imminent war with France. The Fe deralists, who had close ties with the Plutocrats (rule by the wealthy) in Englan d, passed the sedition law. Bouviers law dictionary defines sedition as \"a revo lt against legitimate authority, the raising of commotions and disturbances in the state or advocacy or suggestion by word, act, or writing of public disorder or resista nce to the government\". The idea behind sedition is that the government has the righ t to protect itself against disgruntled citizens. This sounds great on the surf ace until you remember that, as stated in the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, and the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Government is a government of, for and by the PEOPLE. The first victim of this law was Matthew Lyons, a m ember of the Vermont Congress and reporter of a Vermont newspaper. He accused Ada ms of setting himself in a position of king of the people. Lyons soon found hi mself imprisoned, as did many other politicians, writers, and anyone else who dar ed suggest they could govern themselves of speak out against Adams and fellow Fe deralists. Jefferson labeled the law as the \"Alien Friends Act\" and persuaded Kentuc ky and Virginia to pass resolutions against the law. As the people of the N ew Nation began to see their new- found freedoms slip away at the hands of another Ki ng George, they began to rally against Adams, the Federalist and the sedition law. In 1800, Jefferson won election to the presidency by a landslide and Federalists sl owly left, apparently in name only. The citizens now lived in freedom once again, but o nly for a short period of time. In the 1940's, a group called the American Firsters began to oppose President Roosevelt, the New Deal, the government ties with t he Soviet Union, and in particular, going to war with Germany. The FDR admi nistration, with help from a reporter from the Washington Post, entrapped 28 peo ple. Using an alias, the reporter ordered books, pamphlets, etc. and had them sent to Washington D.C. The 28 defendants were indicted, arrested and taken to Was hington D.C. on sedition charges. After four years Chief Justice Laws states , \"This is a travesty upon justice, ...case dismissed.\" Although the government did not win the case, they did succeed in ruining the defendants financially and in scarin g anyone else who would oppose the current administration. On Feb. 16, 1988 at Fort Smith, Arkansas, the gover nment again indicted 14 individuals on sedition charges. After 110 witnesse s for the state, 1200 pieces of"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"visual evidence, and 8 weeks of trial, all defendan ts were found innocent. The other tool the federal government uses is \"cons piracy to commit RICO\". The only evidence required is for someone to say that t hey discussed a commission of a crime with another, just like in Orwell novel, \"198 4\". Interesting! Just think, you can be imprisoned for thought crimes. This is not new. It's been developing since the country started. If certain professional politician s had their way, they would control everything. Another example is the media. We're not saying that we support either of these professions, but look at the difference in standard s. During the Louisiana governor's race, established professional politicians, with a lot of help from mass media, succeeded in lambasting David Duke's campaign and y et the same media censored Gary Trudeau's editorial cartoon depicting allegati ons of Dan Quayle and a DEA file. Nothing obscene or disgusting, but an issue t hat the people deserve to hear. What happened to unbiased news? We realize these things are far removed from the is sues we deal with on the street, but you have to stop and think. If the federal gove rnment tries to make these terror tactics and harassment seem like \"the end justifies the means\", it has to make us justify any tactic we may use to make an arrest (or dare I say \"A STAT\") no matter what rights we may bend or break. Remember, we have the power to protect these rights that were given to us all, even to street cops. Those of you who have had I.S.'s sh ould know best. Citizens deserve no less protection of their rights that what you go t, or at least what you should have gotten. (Note: Research material was taken from the documen tary videotape, \"Sedition USSA\", by Video Truth Network, and the Fall issue o f LIFE MAGAZINE.) Editor McLamb continues: You see, since most Cops are highly patriotic, the truth about what is wrong with America, can spread like wildfire among the ranks.

I w ish to commend and thank both these wonderful young officers for their patriotism and efforts to save our nation. As usual, they are taking a bit of heat, but that is t he price of liberty and true leadership today. As my dear friend Col.

It was once said, \"MAN CANNOT SERVE TWO MASTERS\", I ndeed, we cannot! BUT WHICH OATH? This is a confidential letter from a government Off icer who does not want to be identified. Therefore, we must read this message wi th that in mind. A federal officer, to whom we have given the code n ame \"G\", told us recently that \"G\" was part of a new federal action team that was formed for a very important reason. \"G\" stated that this \"action team\" is extre mely well trained. It is equipped with the newest technology and can respond to any t ype \"emergency\" over a large area. \"G's\" concern is that none of these \"action teams\" members across the nation has been given an oath of office. They have not sworn t o protect any Constitution, people or government. This Officer wonders if perha ps these groups of highly"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"trained men and women are to be used for something UN-AMERICAN. Could it be that these men and women are to take an other type of oath, possibly this one? \"I solemnly affirm to exercise in all loyalty, disc retion and conscience the functions entrusted to me as a member of the international se rvice of the United Nations, to discharge those functions and regulate my conduct w ith the interest of the United Nations only in view, and not to seek or accept ins tructions in respect to the performance of my duties from any government or oth er authority external to the organization.\" - UNITED NATIONS' LOYALTY OATH. Could this be the oath that all U.S. officers will take in the near future? Have some already taken it? Must we reiterate what our illust rious traitor/President Bush stated in front of the UN building February 1, 1992, ...th at we officers would swear an oath to this \"SACRED\" organization in the future? (So we don't appear biased, let us restate that Cli nton and Perot are N.W.O. clones, and if given a chance would do the exact same thing ). The Federal Officer above is not the first person t hat has informed us that the Oath of Allegiance is being attacked. Several have reported changes. Some refer to subtle changes in their State oaths that have been appeari ng in recent months. All such attempts must be challenged. PROTECTING \"THE SYSTEM\" FROM THE MASSES Recapping what we said earlier: In Communist countr ies the SYSTEM or GROUP is always held in higher regard than the individual ci tizen. The alert observer will have noticed that America has now accepted this same pol itical philosophy. In a truly free nation the INDIVIDUAL is protected over the group o r the system. A Constitutional Republic is a system of government which protects e ach individual, and thereby protects the whole. A Democracy is Mob Rule. It pro tects the group or mob over the individual, crushing the individual, if necessary t o protect the group. A Lynch Mob is a prime example of a Democracy \"...The Lynchee d oes not want to get hung, the Lynchers want to hang the Lynchee, so they have a v ote.\" A perfect Democracy! You see, friends and colleagues, the enemies of our Republic, lurking inside our government, have a very big problem. They assume th at officers, after going through our U.S. socialistic/humanistic government schools and government police academies, are now psychologically prepared to do A NYTHING they are ordered to do regardless, to protect \"the system\" from the mas ses. As mentioned earlier, this is always sold to them as \"DOING THEIR PATRIOTIC DUTY\" . This Enemy has for years applied the same program of indoctrination to the Police Officers of other nations, and with great success. They are now convi nced that our fellow Officers, having undergone a similar type of indoctrination, will now make it work here in"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"America as well.

Let us share with you one of our favorite quotes from our second President, John Adams: \"YOU HAVE RIGHTS ANTECEDENT TO ALL EARTHLY GOVERNME NTS: RIGHTS THAT CANNOT BE REPEALED OR RESTRAINED BY HUM AN LAWS; RIGHTS DERIVED FROM THE GREAT LEGISLATOR OF T HE UNIVERSE.\" But of course the international \"Elitists\" like Bus h, Clinton, Perot, Kennedy, Rockefeller, Brezhinsky, Armand Hammer, etc., have a difficulty time relating to this, due to the fact that most have never actually given 100% allegiance to any nation. Over the last 100 years those of Internationalist i lk have slowly drained some, if not all, of this patriotism and independence out of som e of our people. But, let them beware. They are in for a big surprise if they thin k the majority of our people, inside or outside our government, are now ready for the ha rness of servitude under their \"beneficent\" IMPERIAL U.N. RULE. DO YOU HEAR THAT, YOU INTERNATIONALIST BLOODSUCKERS ? Those whom you think will do your dastardly bidding witho ut question (Police, National Guardsmen and Military) give you good warning: The battle to enslave the American people is not won! Not by a long shot. ENEMY'S WORST NIGHTMARE Pushing hard for their vision of a collectivist, \"u topian\" New World Order, the behind-the-scenes controllers of Clinton, Bush and Perot undoubtedly have as their worst nightmare the prospect that you, their ENFORC ERS, might awaken and return to the side of the People. Their plan cannot succee d unless you will act without thinking, not understanding how they will manipulat e and use you to implement their plan for world conquest. Think about it: Whatever w ould they do, if you, because of your strong patriotism, decide to do nothing more t han uphold your oath of service and protection to the People of America and JUST SA Y \"NO\"? WHAT COULD THEY DO? GREAT POWER IN YOUR HANDS Have you ever desired great power? Dear Officer, Gu ardsman, Soldier, you already have GREAT POWER!!

May it serve to lead us into the last main point we wish to leave with you - something we hope you w ill remember above all else. As stated earlier, these treacherous Internationali sts absolutely cannot accomplish their goals without the nation's Enforcers aiding & abetting their treasonous, unconstitutional mandates. But, they know also that for the most part if they can label certain patriotic Americans as \"criminals\", m ost of our fellow Police Officers will respond accordingly and treat them as such. Th is is presently occurring in many areas. IRS Director, Donald Alexander, admitted to Congress 20 years ago, \"We now have so many regulations that everyone is guilty of some violation.\" Imagine what it's like today. Another such attempt, is not only to label as \"crim inals\" those who refuse to relinquish or register weapons of personal defense, but also all those Americans who wish to exercise their Constitutionally guaranteed right to dissent or speak out. Such as we officers have done in this publication and we do regularly through the AID & ABET Police Newsletter. (Note: Aid & Abet Police Ne wsletter is available to Internal Protectors and private citizens by writing to P.O. Box 8787, Phoenix Arizona 85066.) There is ample evidence from testimonies of readers /Officers from various parts of the country, to show that this move is already well begun. But, this labeling of good Americans as \"criminals\" cannot succeed without the full cooperation of the 1,000,000-plus American Police Officers and Nationa l Guardsmen. Keep in mind the following: THERE IS NO WAY WE CAN LOSE IN THIS STRUGGLE TO SAV E OUR GREAT REPUBLIC, IF WE AMERICAN \"INTERNAL PROTECTORS \" WILL DO WHAT WE MUST DO, AND THAT IS TO UPHOLD OUR OATH OF OFFICE TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE FROM ALL ENEMIES.

For those of our brothers and sisters who have chil dren, this very evening quietly steal in and look down into the small faces of your posterity and ask yourselves this question: Can there be a greater work than to save our nation for these little ones? Working together with our fellow countrymen, we can place the final stake through the heart of this Parasitic Beast that has gripped our once vibrant nation by the throat. In so doing, we will secure for ourselves, our chil dren and grandchildren, a grand and marvelous future. HOW CAN YOU PLAY A PART IN OUR NATION'S RECOVERY? EACH OFFICER OR NATIONAL GUARDSMAN THAT WISHES TO B ECOME A PART OF THE RECOVERY OF OUR NATION MUST START WIT H EDUCATION. BUT, BECAUSE OF THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR , IT MUST BE DONE QUICKLY. EACH OFFICER MUST KNOW JUST WHAT A RE THE PROBLEMS AND HOW ONE OFFICER CAN HELP. 1) Start by sharing this publication with every Pol ice Officer, National Guardsman and Soldier you know and ask them to do the same. O rdering a subscription to AID & ABET POLICE NEWSLETTER is another must so that yo u can communicate with other like- minded patriot Officers. Also ther e are very important seminar tapes that have much vital information. Through this expo sure you will learn of many other fine publications, persons and groups that ca n help you grow. (See order information at back of this publication.) NOTE: Sec ondary target for this manual. All Federal State and local Government officials, s chool board members, teachers, ministers, neighbors. 2) This next change will be hard for certain collea gues. But, trust us on this one. You must seek out those whom the government and the med ia have told you are the \"Enemies of America\" - those the government says ar e using the Constitution to destroy our nation. We told you this would be a tou gh one! There are indeed groups that were set up to use the U.S. Constitution to destroy America, such as the ACLU. We speak only of those A mericans whom the government and media \"attack\" vehemently. Those who are presently risking incarceration daily to try to awaken the American p eople to the traitors in our government. This is the group that government and t he controlled media have labeled as \"evil\", \"crazy\", \"right-wing fanatics\", \"violence prone\", \"un-American\", \"hatemongers\", \"radicals\", etc., etc. Yes, these gr eat AMERICAN PATRIOTS are listed as \"PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE\" by our governme nt. Can you guess why that is? It is because they are the ONLY PEOPLE IN OUR NATION who are fighting the NEW WORLD ORDER. In truth, they are no ne of the horrible things"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"our government and the media say they are. Trust yo ur fellow Officers on this until you have met these great Americans yourself. If we are wrong, then you will know it very quickly. Is that not so? These wonderfully \"crazy\" Americans meet in small g roups all across our nation every week, to non-violently plan and work to save our nation through education from the terrible tragedy of Internationalism and g lobalism and the likes. These people are not the wealthy. They, like police offic ers, are the working class. Theirs is the spirit that made America the greatest nation on earth! They have heart and they have love; and all of them love Freedom. But, make no mistake, they are not \"weak\". If need be, they will indeed go to war against thos e who try to enslave them, their families and their fellow Americans. ATTEND MEETING. Go to as many of their meetings as possible and learn. Even though they may at first be suspect of you (as a go vernment officer), get with them, and tell them you truly love America and want to be knowledgeable of what is occurring in your country and want to help. They wi ll teach you, as they have taught the officers who have put together this publication , and many other American protectors. These patriots know our nation's foundi ng principles, know what went wrong and how to fix America. 3) Officer, if you believe in prayer, do pray! Pray that the Lord will lead you as HE is presently leading many of your fellow officers t o know what role you can play in the recovery of our nation. Your police colleagues give you this guarantee: If you are sincere, you will get an answer. 4) Write to us. We are your brothers and sisters in law enforcement and we love you. We truly do! That may sound strange to you Macho Cops, but we me an it. Those that know us know we mean it. Have you ever been in a foxhole wi th the bullets flying all around? Or in a commercial building on night shift, doing a burglary check when several big Bad Guys came out of the dark? Did you not love him who protected your backside? Get the point? You know exactly what we mean. Hones tly, it is past time that we show our brotherly love for our countrymen. We're here as your support. You're going to need it if you decide to stand up for your fellow Americans. Write, let us know what is on you r mind and in your heart. Some of us, your colleagues, have been through a living hell in order to keep serving and protecting the People from all enemies. Sharing the truth found in this publication with your fellow officers will not be popular among some within your agencies. Remember, there is little you will go through that we have not already experienced. Let us help. Together, we are strong! THAT'S ALL FOR NOW!"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"It is indeed just that simple. STUDY but don't take all day about it. Go to those who know. If you can't find a group of involved, knowle dgeable, patriotic Americans write to us and we will connect you with some fine Patriots in your area. BATTLE CRY The most important quote in promoting this plan of recovery for our nation is this one by Sir Winston Churchill. In a sense it is the Battle Cry of all FREE MEN. It is the battle cry of POLICE AGAINST THE NEW WORLD ORDE R: \"Still, if you will not fight for the right when yo u can easily win without bloodshed, if you will not fight when your victory will be sur e and not so costly, you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you and only a precarious chance for survival. There may be a wors e case. You may have to fight when there is no chance of victory, because it is b etter to perish than to live as slaves.\" - Winston Churchill THE HEGELIAN PRINCIPLE Revolutionaries in government have created economic chaos, shortages in food and fuel, confiscatory taxation, a crises in education, the threat of war, and other diversions to condition Americas for \"The New World Order.\" The technique is as old as politics itself. It is t he Hegelian principle of bringing about change in a three-step process: Theses Anti-thesis and Synthesis. The first step (thesis) is to create a problem. The second step (anti-thesis) is to generate opposition to the problem (fear, panic, hy steria). The third step (synthesis) is to offer the solution to the problem created in step one, - change which would have been impossible to impose on the people without the proper psychological conditioning achieved in stages one and two. Applying the Hegelian principle, and irresistible f inancial influence, concealed mattoids seek to dismantle social and political str uctures by which free men govern themselves - ancient landmarks erected at great cos t in blood and treasure. Their objective is to emasculate sovereign states, merge nations under universal government, centralize economic power, and control the world's people and resources. STATES BEING ABOLISHED Study the constitution of your state. You may find that your state constitution no longer describes the boundaries of the state effect ively abolishing the state. At last check, the only states that still lay out their bou ndaries in their constitutions are Washington, Idaho, Montana, North and South Dakota, Wyoming, Iowa, Wisconsin,"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Indiana, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Arizona, N ew Mexico and Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama and Florida. When the State borders are no longer in the State C onstitution, it is the signal that the State has lost its sovereignty (and its State Citiz ens). Now a CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FORMED WHICH IS THE STEP INTO INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM THROUGH THE UNITED NATIONS ...WAKE UP AMERICA! Vote Down Home Rule! THIS IS A DESIGNED AND PLANNED POLITICAL REVOLUTION. This is being done through the ballot b ox to destroy our State Constitutions and State Governments while we are ke pt busy fighting brush fires and fanning windmills on lesser matters of importance o r of no significance. Obtain a copy of your present State Constitution an d a copy of my proposed changes of your State Constitution. Keep watch for attempts to remove boundaries. The prohibition in both the State and the United St ates Constitutions are very clearly defined and impregnable. The only way that these ch anges can be made, of course, is to change the Constitutions. The perpetrators of Re gional and World Government well know this. They well know that the STATE GOVER NMENTS WILL HAVE TO BE ABOLISHED BEFORE THEY CAN FORCE REGIONAL, METROPOLITAN AND WORLD GOVERNMENT IN THE UNITED STA TES - This has already been done in 30 of the 50 states !

A world in which adjustment to change takes place in accordanc e with the principles of the United Nations. In order to make possible the achie vement of that goal, the program sets forth the following specific objectives toward which nations should direct their efforts: The disbanding of all national armed forces and the prohibition of their re- establishment in any form whatsoever other than tho se required to preserve internal order and for contribution to a United Nations Peac e Force. The elimination from national arsenals of all armam ents, including all weapons of mass destruction and the means for their delivery, other than those required for a United Nations Peace Force and for maintaining inte rnal order: The manufacturer of armaments would be prohibited e xcept for those of agreed types and quantities to be used by the U.N.
