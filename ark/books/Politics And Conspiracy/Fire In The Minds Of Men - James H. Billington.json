The Center of International Studies of Princeton University and its two directors, Klaus Knorr and Cyril Black, gave initial support and encouragement. The full-time administrative demands of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, which I have directed since the fall of 1973, have in a sense delayed the completion of this work. But in a deeper sense the Wilson Center has greatly enriched this off­ hours labor by providing continuing contact with a diversified, inter­ national group of scholars-and by challenging me to do what I was urging on others: the comple tion of scholarly work on something that matters. I have benefited during the preparat ion of this work from various forms of support provided by Princeton University (including a McCosh Faculty Fellowship ), the International Research and Exchanges Board, the Rockefeller Foundation (including the Villa Serbelloni ), the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, and the Maison des Sciences de l'Homme and Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes. I owe a special debt to the two principal libraries I have used, the Firestone Library in Princeton during the early stages of work, and the Library of Congress in recent years. Their supportive staffs-and those of the other libraries mentioned in the list at the beginning of my documentation at the end of this book-have my sincerest thanks. This work was also aided in some ways by my concurrent labors as a writer for Life in the late six­ ties and as a member and as chairman of the Board of Foreign Scholar­ ships (Fulbright program ) in the first half of the seventies. Among the many who have aided me in the preparation of this book, I would like to pay special tribute to Zdenek David, curator of Slavic books at Princeton and then librarian of the Wilson Center ; Mernie Weathers, an incomparable executive assistant at the Center; and Midge Deeter, an extraordinary editor. I also thank those who gave me specially helpful referenc es, comments, or criticisms in the early stages of this work: Isaiah Berlin, John Talbott, Jerry Seigel, Fred Starr, Robert Tucker , Jacques Godechot, Timur Timofe ev, Armando Saitta, Sidney Hook, Rondo Cameron, Leo Valiani, Albert Soboul, E6in MacWhite, Alan Spitzer, Orest Pelech, Peter Than, Arthur Lehnin g, and especially Robert Palmer, Andrzej Walicki, and Joseph Strayer.

Modern revolutiona ries are believe rs, no less com­ mitted and intense than were the Christians or Muslims of an earlier era. What is new is the belief that a perfect secular order will emerge from the forcible overthrow of traditional authority. This inherently im­ plausible idea gave dynamism to Europe in the nineteenth century, and has become the most successful ideological export of the West to the world in the twentieth . This is a story not of revolutions, but of revolutionar ies: the innova­ tive creators of a new tradition . The historical frame is the century and a quarter that extends from the waning of the French Revolution in the late eighteenth century to the beginnings of the Russian Revolution in the early twentieth. The theater was Europe of the industrial era; the main stage, journalistic offices within great European cities. The dia­ logue of imaginat ive symbols and theoretical disputes produced much of the language of modern politics. At center stage stood the characte ristic, nineteenth-cent ury European revolution ary: a thinker lifted up by ideas, not a worker or peasant bent down by toil. He was part of a small elite whose story must be told \"from above,\" much as it may displease those who believe that history in general (and revolut ionary history in particular) is basically made by socio-econo mic pressures \"from below.\" This \"elite\" focus does not imply indifference to the mass, human suffering which underlay the era of this narrative. It reflects only the special need to concentrate here on the spiritual thirst of those who think rather than on the material hunger of those who work. For it was passionate intellectuals who created and developed the revolutionary faith. This work seeks to ex­ plore concretely the tradition of revolutionar ies, not to explain ab­ stractly the process of revolution. My approach has been inductive rather than deductive , explorative rather than definitive : an attempt to open up rather than \"cover\" the subject. My general conclusions can be stated simply at the outset-and, for the sake of argument, more bluntly than they may appear in the text that follows . The revolution ary faith was shaped not so much by the critical ra­ tionalism of the French Enlightenment (as is generally believed) as by the occultism and proto-romanticism of Germany. This faith was incubated in France during the revolutionary era within a small sub-"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"4 Introduction culture of literary intellectuals who were immersed in journalism, fas­ cinated by secret societie s, and subsequently infatuated with \"ideolo­ gies\" as a secular surrogate for religious belief. The professional revolutionaries who first appeared during the French Revolution sought, above all, radical simplicity. Their deepest conflicts revolved around the simple words of their key slogan : liberty, equa lity, fraterni ty. Liberty had been the battle cry of earlier revolutions (in sixteenth-cen tury Holland, seventeent h-century England, eighteenth-cen­ tury Americ a) which produced complex political structures to limit tyr­ anny (separating powers, constituting rights, legitimizing federati on). The French Revolution also initially invoked similar ideas, but the new and more collectivist ideals of fraternity and equality soon arose to rival the older concept of liberty. The words natianalism and communism were first invented in the 17gos to define the simpler, more sublime, seemingly less selfish ideals of fraternity and equality, respectively. The basic struggle that subsequent ly emerged among committed revolution­ aries was between advocates of national revolution for a new type of fraternity and those of social revolution for a new type of equality. The French national example and republican ideal dominated the revolutionary imagination throughout the first half of the nineteenth century. Exiled Francophile intellectuals from Poland and Italy largely fashioned the dominant concept of revolutionary nationalism -invent­ ing most modern ideas on guerrilla violence and wars of national libera­ tion, expressing their essentially emotional ideal best in mythic his­ tories, vernacular poetry, and operatic melodrama. Rival social revolutionaries began to challenge the romantic national­ ists after the revolutions of 1830; and this socialist tradition increas­ ingly predominated after the forming of the First International in I 864 and the movement of the revolution ary cause from French to German and Russian leadership . Social revolutionaries expressed their essen­ tially rationalistic ideal best in prose pamphlets and prosaic organiza­ tions. Their hidden model was the impersonal and dynamic machine of factory industry rather than the person alized but static lodge of the Masonic aristocracy. No less fateful than the schism between national and social revolu­ tionaries was the conflict among social revolutionaries that began in the 184os between Marx and Proudhon. The former's focus on destroy­ ing the capitalist economic system clashed with the latter's war on the centralized, bureaucratic state. This conflict continued between the heirs of Marx (principally in Germany and Russia) and of Proudhon (among Latin and Slavic anarchists, populists, and syndicalis ts). The word intelligentsia and the thirst for ideology migrated east from Poland to Russia (and from a national to a social revolution ary cause) through the Russian student radicals of the 186os, who developed a new ascetic type of terrorism. Lenin drew both on this Russian tradition of violence and on German concepts of organization to create the Bol­ shevism that eventually brought the revolution ary tradition out of the wilderness and into power. The revolution ary faith developed in nineteenth-century Europe only"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Introduction 5 within those societies that had not previously (I) legitimized ideologi­ cal dissent by breaking with medieval forms of religious authority, and ( 2) modified monarchical power by accepting some form of organized political oppositi on. In northern Europe and North America, where these conditions were met by Protestant and parliamentary traditions, the revolutionary faith attracted almost no indigenous adherents. Thus, the revolution ary tradition can be seen as a form of political-ideological opposition that arose first against authoritarian Catholicism (in France, Italy, and Poland ) and then against other religiously based autocracies (in Lutheran Prussia, Orthodox Russia). The most dedicated and pro­ fessional social revolution aries-from Marechal through Blanqui, Marx, and Bakunin to Lenin-came from such societies and tended to become that rarest of all forms of true believe r: a militant atheist. They and other pioneering revolutionaries were largely middle -class, male intellectuals with relatively few familial attachmen ts. Revolu­ tionary movements tended to become more internationalist and vi­ sion ary whenever women played a leading role; more parochial and pragmatic whenever workers were in command. Before attempting to chronicle the drama, the dogmas, and the dis­ putes of this new, secular religion-in-the-m aking, it is important to linger on the mystery and the majesty of faith itself. The heart of revolutionary faith, like any faith, is fire: ordinary ma­ terial transformed into extraordinary form, quantities of warmth sud­ denly changing the quality of substance. If we do not know what fire is, we know what it does. It burns. It destroys life; but it also supports it as a source of heat, light, and-above all-fascination . Man, who works with fire as homo faber, also seems foredoomed in his freedom to play with it as homo ludens . Our particular chapter in history unfolds at a time of physical trans­ formation in Europe that was almost as momentous as the first dis­ covery of fire must have been in the mists of antiquity. The industrial revolution was permitting men to leash fire to machines-and to unleash fire power on each other-with a force undreamed of in earlier ages. In the midst of those fires appeared the more elusive flame that Dostoevsky described in the most searching work of fiction ever written about the revolutionary movem ent: The Possessed. He depicted a stagnant (tranquil ?) provincial town that was suddenly inspired (infected ?) by new ideas. Shortly after a turbulent literary evening, a mysterious fire broke out; and a local official shouted out into the nocturnal confusion : \"The fire is in the minds of men, not in the roofs of buildin gs.\" Dostoevsky was writing under the impact of two great fires that disturbed him deeply and heralded the transfer of revolution ary leadership from France to Russia. These fires had broken o ut in imperial St. Petersburg in the spring of 1861 (where the emanci­ pation of the serfs seemed to have inflamed rather than calmed pas­ sions), and in imperial Paris ten years later (where the flaming defeat of the Paris Commune ended forever the era of romantic illusions ). The flame of faith had begun its migrations a century earlier, when"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"6 Introduction some European aristocrats transferred their lighted candles from Christian altars to Masonic lodges. The flame of occult alchemi sts, which had promised to turn dross into gold, reappeared at the center of new \"circles\" seeking to recreate a golden age: Bavarian Illuminists conspiring against the Jesuits, French Philadelphians against Napoleon, Italian charcoal burners against the Hapsburgs. When the most important anti-Napoleonic conspiracy was ridiculed for attempting \"to use as a lever something which is only a match,\" its leader replied that With a match one has no need of a lever; one does not lift up the world, one burns it.l The leader in spreading the conspiracy to Italy soon noted that \"the Italian flame\" had spread \"the fire of freedom to the most frozen land of Petersburg.\" 2 There the first Russian revolution occurred in Decem­ ber 1825. Its slogan, \"From the spark comes the flame!\" was originated by the first man to predict an egalitarian social revolution in the eigh­ teenth century (Sylvain Man�chal ) and revived by the first man to real­ ize such a revolution in the twentieth (Lenin, who used it as the epigram for his journal, The Spark ). A recurrent mythic model for revolutionaries-e arly romantic s, the young Marx, the Russians of Lenin's time-was Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods for the use of mankind. The Promethean faith of revolution aries resembled in many respects the general modern belief that science would lead men out of darkness into light. But there was also the more pointed, millennia! assumption that, on the new day that was dawnin g, the sun would never set. Early during the French upheaval was born a \"solar myth of the revolution,\" suggesting that the sun was rising on a new era in which darkness would vanish forever. This image became implanted \"at a level of consciousness that simulta­ neously interpreted something real and produced a new reality.\" 3 The new re ality they sought was radically secular and stridently sim­ ple. The ideal was not the balanced complexity of the new American federation, but the occult simplicity of its great seal: an all-seeing eye atop a pyramid over the words Novus Ordo Seclorum. In search of primal, natural truths, revolutionaries looked back to pre-Christian antiquity-adopting pagan names like \"Anaxagoras\" Chaumette and \"Anacharsis\" Cloots, idealizing above all the semimythic Pythagoras as the model intellec t-turned-revolution ary and the Pythagorean belief in prime numbers, geomet ric forms, and the higher harmonies of music. Many of the same Strasbourg musicians who first played La Marseil­ laise in 1792 had introduced Mozart's Magic Flute to French audiences in the same city only a few months earlier; and Mozart's illuminist mes­ sage seemed to explain the fuller meaning of the jour de gloire that Rouget de Lisle's anthem had proclai med: The rays of the sun have vanquished the night, The powers of darkness ha ve yielded to lig ht.4"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Introduction 7 The rising sun brought heat as well as light, for the fire was generally lit not at high noon on a tabula rasa by some philosophe r-king, but rather by some unknown guest arriving at midnight amidst the excesses of Don Giovanni's banquet. \"Communism ,\" the label Lenin finally adopted, was invented not by the great Rousseau, but by a Rousseau du ruisseau (Rousseau of the gutter) : the indulgent fetishist and nocturnal street­ walker in prerevolution ary Paris, Restif de la Bretonne. Thus the revolu­ tionary label that now controls the destiny of more than one billion peo­ ple in the contemporary world sprang from the erotic imagination of an eccentric writer. Like other key words of the revolutionary tradition it first appeared as the rough ideograph of a language in the making: a road sign pointing to the future. This study attempts to identify some of these signs along the path from Restif to Lenin. It follows sparks across national borders, carried by small groups and idiosyncratic individuals who created an incen­ diary legacy of ideas. We will say relatively little about either the familiar, formal organizational antecedents of contemporary Commu­ nism (the three Internation als, the Russian Social Democratic party) or the actual revolution ary conflagrations of the period. We shall ex­ clude altogether the contempora ry era in which the stage has moved from Europe to the world, and revolutionaries from the anticipation to the exercise of power. We shall deal repeatedly with the linguistic creativity of revolution­ arie s, who used old words (democracy, nation, revolution, and liberal ) in new ways and invented altogether new words like socialist and com­ munist. Their appealing new vocabulary was taken over for nonrev­ olution ary usage-a s in the adoption of republican and democrat for competing political parties in postrevolutionary Americ a, or in the con­ servative cooptation of nation, liberal, and even radical in late nineteenth century Europe. Revolutionaries also originated other key phrases used by nonrevolutionary social theorists in our own century: cybernet ics, in­ tellig entsia. Even speculation about \"the year 2ooo\" began not with the futurology of the Ig6os, but with a dramatic work written in the 178os by the same figure who invented the word communist. \" The origins of revolutionary words and symbols is of more than anti­ quarian inter est; for, in the contemporary world where constitutions and free elections are vanishing almost as rapidly as monarchs, revolutionary rhetoric provides the formal legitimat ion of most political authority. The historian's path back to origins leads, however, into often murky labyrinths; and requires a willingness to follow seminal figures in leaps of fantasy to remote times and on long marches into distant spaces.6 Revolutionaries (no less than prophets of the Jud aeo-Christian-Moslem lineage ) seek to find their \"holy other\" in historical time. They tend to become more extreme in the present as they idealize an ever more dis­ tant past. Those who glorified pre-Christian druids tended to outstrip in fanaticism those who looked only to the early Christian s.7 Revolutionaries have also pursued a geographical guest for some ideal place where the \"holy other\" could be wholly present. Activists have often sought out a small, clearly encompassed area within which per-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"8 Introduction fection could become material. The earliest utopias of the imagin ation and the starting places for many key nineteenth-cen tury revolutiona ries were often islands. In their search for sacred space, the original revolu­ tionaries made judgments through an apotheosis of location : left vs. right or mountain vs. plain in the French National Assembly, an inner circle of the dedicated within a broader circumference of the affiliated in their revolutionary organizations. What Cloots called the \"world-map of revolution\" was explored and charted by a new breed of politicized artists and writers. Flags and songs provided a semaphore of salvation. The bourgeois Third Estate sartorially celebrated its liberation from the aristocratic Second Estate by lowering its knee britches and becoming sans-culottes-only to don the tight new uniforms prescribed by the revolutionary citizen-state. The revolution ary faith was built more by ideological innovators than by political leaders . He who held actual power during the original French Revolution was generally \"a provisional being ... a creature of exceptional circumstance ... not a professional of the Revoluti on.\" 8 Professionalism began later with a different kind of man: an intellec­ tual who lacked political experience, but saw in revolut ion an object of faith and a source of vocation, a channel for sublimated emotion and sublime ambition. If traditional religion is to be described as \"the opium of the people,\" the new revolutionary faith might well be called the am­ phetamine of the intellectuals. But such characterizations are neither fair to the believer nor helpful to the historian. The wellsprings of this faith are deep, and have sus­ tained men and women on the way to the scaffold of an executioner as well as to the platform of power. The youthful intellectuals who were the prophets and priests of this new secular religion were largely crying in the wilderness throughout the nineteenth century, struggling against overwhelming odds for revolutions that they saw coming mainly with the eyes of faith. It was not self-indulgent pity that caused one of the most militant and original early revolutionaries to compare his wandering life of exile to an eternal purgatory of \"suffering without end and without hope\": I no longer have a friend ... no relatives, no old colleagues ... no one writes me or thinks about me any more . .. . I ha ve become a foreigner in my own country, and I am a foreigner among foreigner s. The earth itself refu ses to adopt me.9 Revolutionaries were generally sustained in such loneliness and de­ spair-and protected from ridicule and indiffere nce-by secularized nineteent h-century versions of the old Judaeo-Ch ristian belief in deliv­ erance-through-history. At a deep and often subconscious level, the revolutionary faith was shaped by the Christian faith it attempted to replace. Most revolutionaries viewed history prophetically as a kind of unfolding morality play. The present was hell, and revolution a col­ lective purgatory leading to a future earthly paradise. The French Rev­ olution was the Incarnation of hope, but was betrayed by Judases within the revolutionary camp and crucified by the Pilates in power."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction 9 The future revolution would be a kind of Second Coming in which the Just would be vindicated. History itself would provide the final judg­ ment; and a new community beyond all kingdoms would come on earth as it never could in heaven. A classical, contemporary statement of this belief lies in the found­ ing manifesto of Fidel Castro's revolutionary movement, History Will Absol ve Me. He represented his own original revolutionary assault on the Moncada barracks as a kind of Incarnation. The subsequent torture and martyrdom of his virile fellow revolution aries was the Passion and Crucifixi on; and Castro's trial by Batista was Christ before Pilate. The Cuban people were promised corporate Resurrection, and their revolu­ tionary apostles Pentecostal power. The coming revolution would ful­ fill all the Law (the five \"revolutionary laws\" of the Moncada raiders ) and the Prophets (Jose Marti) . 1 0 Such total belief in secular salvation is uniquely modern : the sublime creation of the age of political religion ushered in by the American and French Revolutio ns.ll Previous political upheavals-even when called revolutions-generally sought a new leader rather than a new order. The norm was revolt rather than revolution-either the \"primitive re­ bellion\" of outlawed \" social bandits\" 12 or the \"pursuit of the millen­ nium\" by religious prophets seeking to move beyond nature into a state of grace.l3 Never before was the word revolution related to the creation of a totally new and entirely man-made order. With the mili­ tant, secular French Revolution \"a new er a opens, that of beginnings without return.\" 1 4 Particular ly after the revolution turned to terror in 1793 and to retreat in 1794, many realized that the revolutionary process would not auto­ matically bring deliverance and social harmony. A new species of man, the professional revolutionary, emerged during the \"Thermidorean re­ action\" to keep the dream alive. He argued that the French Revolution was incomplete, and that history required a second, final revolution and a new type of man dedicated to serving it. The full-time revolu­ tionary profession began not with the ruling politicians but with the intellectual activists in Babeuf's \"Conspiracy of the Equals,\" who had little in common with earlier revolutionaries \"except in the imagination of the police.\" 15 Yet the tradition that developed from the \"people of Babeuf\" cannot be divorced altogether from \"the imagination of the police.\" For revolu­ tionary and counter-revolutionary forces often lived in a kind of sym­ biotic relationship. The same writer who first prophesied a new revolu­ tionary society for France in the late 176os 1 6 also coined in the early 17 8os the prophetic phrase les extremes se touchent.11 We shall re­ peatedly have occasion to note the interaction and often unconscious borrowing between the extremes of Right and Left. A work of history is , of course, a product of its own time as well as a description of another. This study originated in graduate university teaching during the 196os , when some Western intellectuals began to think of themselves as revolution aries. Their voices were often shrill"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"10 Introduction and rarely heeded. Most people in the West remained attached to either their material possessions or their spiritual heritage. Yet within over­ developed universities even more than underdeveloped economies there was often a kind of fascination -compounded sometimes with fear and/ or secret delight -at the perceived reappearance of a political species long thought to be nearing extinction. Yet the perspective of history seemed strangely missing among rev­ olutionar ies, antirevolutionar ies, and voyeurs alike. Activists seemed largely uninterested in the substantial academic literature that had al­ ready accumulated by the mid-sixtie s; and new writing often seemed unusually narrow or polemically preoccupied with immediate issues. There seemed as well to be deeper ideological, cultural, and even pro­ fessional reasons for continued historical ignorance of the revolution­ ary tradition. Ideologically, historical understanding has been muddied in the post­ war era by the rhetoric of superpower politics. The American and the Soviet states are each the product of a revoluti on: the first to proclaim, respectively, a new political and a new social order.l s The American Revolution of 1776 was a classic contest for political liberty secured by constitutional complexity. But American sympathy for the simpler cause of nationalism elsewhere (including within the Soviet empire ) has often blunted the ability of American leaders to distinguish between revolutions seeking limited liberties and those seeking the more unlimited gratifications of nationalistic fraternity. The Russian Revolution of 1917 was the classic revolution for social equality. But the Soviet leaders adopted as well the language of liberal and national revolution aries-and debased the entire revolutionary vo­ cabulary by using it to rationalize imperial despotism. Rejecting Marx­ ism as the progenitor of Stalinism, the liberal West proved, in its tech­ nocratic era, almost equally hostile to the anti-authoritarian, Proudhonist alternative to Marxism within the social revolution ary tradition. Culturally, historical understanding was complicated in America by the voracious overuse of the word revolution ary in a generally non­ revolutionary society. Not only was the word abused by advertisers to announce the most trivial innovations in taste and technology, but also by social commentators anxious to contend that a \"revolution\" was occurring in the politically conservative America of the early 1970s. The revolutionaries were variously identified as drifting flower chil­ dren,19 as the technological innovators they rejected,20 and as human­ istic capitalists who presumably had little in common with either.2 1 It was only marginally more absurd for a bizarre drifter named Rasputin to character ize his free-form sexual-religious commune of affluent youth as \"revolution ary\" -and to invent the verb \"to revolute\" : . .. let the people do what they want . .. keep them revoluting. Revolu­ tion, constantly changing, going on to the next thing .. . . 22 All of this preceded the cacophonous deluge of Bicentennial messages about the enduring importance of the American Revolution variously interprete d. The day after the two-hundredth anniversary of the signing"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introdu ction 11 of the Declaration of Indepen dence, the leading newspaper in the Amer­ ican capital featured a proclamation of \"the new American Revolut ion.\" But its \"new American Maoism\" for a \"post-Copernican Age\" seemed little more than a final sprinkling of intellectual confetti left over from the Age of Aqu arius.23 Such confusion flows in part from the general modern tendency to at­ tach \"a mag ical, binding and unique meaning to the word 'revolu­ tion,' \" 2 4 in an age when \"the word 'revolution' is always construed in a positive light.\" 2\" Yet even if the word has been \"emptied of all mean­ ing by constant overuse,'' it does not necessa rily follow that it will \"soon cease to be current.\" 2 6 Professionally, American academic historians may themselves have contributed-ir onically and inadvertently-to the erosion of historical memory about the revolutionary tradition . By devoting inordin ate en­ ergy to demonstr ating either their political \"relevance\" (the sixties) or their methodological \"rigor\" (the seventi es), many have neglected the enduring obligation of open-minded immersion in the legacy of the past. Cliometricians and cliopetitioners alike may have been too con­ fident that they possessed in the present either a method or a message for the future-and, as a result, were too willing to see the past as an instrument to be used rather than a record to be explored. As a university -based historian during the early years of this study, my \"method\" was to ignore professorial debates and to spend my time with old books and new students. The experience gave me an unanti­ cipated sense of \"relevance.\" I was repeatedly struck in the depths of libraries with precedent for almost everything that was daily being hailed as a novelty from the rooftops outside . I came to know figures like Thomas (Ismail) Urb ain, a Black Muslim of the 183os unknown to those of today. He adopted Islam and Al­ gerian nationalism a century before the same pattern was followed by other black revolutionaries from the same West Indies. Flora Tristan, the Franco-Peruvian founder of the first international proletar ian or­ ganization , anticip ated today's radical feminism, by invading the all­ male House of Lords in London of the late 183os and removing her disguise as a male Turk to dramatize her cause. The struggle between the old and the new left recapitulated much of the Marx-Proudhon con­ flict. Even the marginalia of leftism such as ideological sky-jackers had precedents in the revolutionary high-jacking of Mediterranean ships by Carlo Pisacane in the r8sos. The concept of a revolution along generational lines was already fully developed in Gerontoc racy of r828 by the future Swiss revolutionary leader, James Fazy. Germany had produced even earlier the prototypical \"modern\" student counter-culture : rakish dress, long hair, narcotic highs, and sexual lows. Out of this subculture came violent calls for a \"propaganda of the deed\" long before contemporary terroris ts. The anti­ traditional musical theater of the early nineteenth century inspired real revolution in a way that rock festivals of the recent past only avowed to do. But these were minor discoveries of antecedents along the path di­ rected toward constructing an account of origins that might add some"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"12 Introduction insight from fresh historical research to the substantial work that already exists on the modern revolutionary tradition. 27 This study will, it is hoped, broaden the base of enquiry even as it arouses controversy by considering Bonneville and Nodier as well as Babeuf among the founding fathe rs; Dezamy and Barmby as well as Marx among the com­ munist pioneers ; media of communication as well as means of organiza­ tion; and Radchenko as well as Lenin among the authors of Bolshevism. This study necessa rily deals with only a small part of a rich story. It will not provide the traditional staples of either comprehensive po­ litical history or rounded individual biograph ies. In addition , readers should be specifically forewarned that I am not following any of three familiar approaches to the revolutionary tradition : the hagiographic, the sociological, or the psychological. Hagiog raphy is the retroactive justific ation of a revolution in power: the portrayal of precursors in the past for purposes of indoctrination in the present. In this approach, saints and sinners, heroes and heretics are created and catalogued to support the current political judgments of the recognized revolutionary succession. From such an intensely partisan tradition , of course, has come the bulk of historical writing on revolution aries. The critical historian can find here not only invaluable source material, but also insights from Marxist historical analysi s, par­ ticularly in the period prior to Stalin when relatively free speculation was still permitted in the Soviet Union. A massive new Soviet history, The International Workers' Movement, will provide an authoritative codification of post-Stalinist orthodoxy. The first two volumes cover the same period as this book, predictably stress­ ing the actions of workers and the doctrines of Marx. But the new peri­ odization, the international perspective, and the assignment of specific sections to different authors -all give this work an interest largely ab­ sent from earlier versions of the hagiographic genre. 2s A very differ­ ent line of saints and devils is traced in the philosophically rich history of Marxism by the brilliant, exiled Polish revisionist and critic, Leszek Kolakowski.29 The sociological approach predominates among social historians in the West 3 0 as well as nonhag iographic Marxists.3 1 That the revolution­ ary tradition was intimately related to forces of industrial developm ent, class conflict, and social change in the modern world is incontestable. But it does not follow-as many sociological historians either assert or imply-that the revolution ary tradition is simply produced or \"caused\" by these processes. Such an explanation may be argued as a hypothesis or asserted as an act of faith. But it can hardly be called a scientific fact-and it may actually serve to rationa lize restriction on the range of enquiry, which the open experimental method should always seek to expand. Microhistorians of the sociological school have been increasingly critical of those broad histories of the revolutionary era that focus on the diffusion of French power to local elites.3 2 There clearly is a need to understand better the widely different regional and social experiences"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Introduction 13 of a complex continent -and for that matter the human variety con­ tained within the French term \"Jacobin.\" Since our subject is not the politics of the revolutionary era, but the genesis and spread of the revolutionary tradition, it is necessarily the story of a few ideas and of key people. So many of them have been neglected or forgotten that it seems task enough to enlarge the inven­ tory and provide a historical framework for tracing the development of this small, but immeasurably important subculture of nineteenth­ century Europe. The effort here will be to maintain a kind of agnosticism on first causes while bringing into view some relatively neglected data and ad­ vancing some new hypot heses. In those areas where intellectual history can approach scientific precision, however, this work will attempt to trace the origins of key words, symbols, ide as, and organizational forms. The psychological method is currently much in favor as a means of explaining data about men and ideas. Since revolutionaries are intense people at war with accepted social norms, they have become favorite subjects for this kind of analysis-p articularly in Americ a.33 The sus­ picion remains, however, that Freudian, even more than Marxist, analy­ sis may itself be a somewhat dated technique -at times more ap­ propriate for the period of the historian than for the historical period. Aside from the recognized difficulties of retroactive psychoanalysis , the fact is that most of the important early revolutionaries seem sur­ prisingly free of unusual personal characterist ics. One of the best stud­ ies of the emotional side of the original French revolutionaries points out that \"the future revolutionaries were almost all docile pupils of Jesuits and Oratorians.\" 34 Like most other French children of their time, they were fond of their mothers, of their native regions, and of mildly sentimental, apolitical literature. Revolutionaries in the subsequen t, romantic era were rarely as idio­ syncratic and antisocial as artists and poets, and less committed to violence than is generally realized. The schools of thought that played the most important roles in developing a revolutionary tradition all saw themselves providing the rationality that would end violence. Po­ liticized Illuminists promised inner moral renewal ; messia nic Saint­ Simonians, an organic order to end revolutionary unrest; Young Hegeli­ ans, the peaceful completion of Prussian reforms. The fascinating fact is that most revolutionaries sought the simple , almost banal aims of modern secular man generally. What was unique was their intensity and commitment to realizing them. This faith and dedication made the revolutionary trailblazers bigger than life-and deeply controversial. Their progress represented, for some, humanity emerging on wings from its cocoon ; for others, a malignancy attacking civilization itself.

I am further disposed to wonder if this secular creed, which arose in Judaeo-Christian culture, might not ultimately prove to be only a stage in the continuing metamorphosis of older forms of faith 38 and to speculate that the belief in secular revolution, which has legitimized so much authoritarianism in the twentiet h cen­ tury, might dialectically prefigure some rediscovery of religious evolu­ tion to revalidate democracy in the twenty-first.

Three Rus­ sian revolutions-in 1905, March 1917, and November 1917-brought the revolution ary tradition out of the wilderness and into power. Other cities also played decisive roles: Strasbourg, where German ideas entered France and the national revolutionary ideal burst into song in the 1790s; Lyon, where class warfare first fueled the rival social revolutionary tradition in the 183os; and Berlin, where Marx was first radicalized and where a Marxist revolution failed in 1918-19- dooming the communist cause to confinement in Russia for the next thirty years. The site of legitimacy was not revolution ary St. Peters­ burg, which took the new name \"Leningrad\" from the vic torious leader; it was the medieval Kremlin within conservative Moscow. Seen from above the revolutionary tradition is a story of elite, intel­ lectual leaders : a thin line of apostolic succession from Buonarroti to Lenin. The former was the leading survivor and historian of the first organizat ion for secular, social revolution : the Babeuf conspiracy of 1796-97. Like St. Peter among the Romans, Filippo Buonarroti was the rock on which subsequent revolutionaries -built. By the time of his death in 1837, social revolutionary leadership had passed to his admirer, Louis Auguste Blanqui, who retained special authority throughout the Paris­ dominated era. Leadership moved from Paris to St. Pet ersburg through Blanqui's Rus­ sian collaborator, Peter Tkachev; his compatriots assassinated the Rus­ sian tsar in St. Petersburg in I 881, the year Blanqui died in Paris. When Lenin's older brother was hanged six years later for plotting to kill the next tsar, young Lenin became the vehicle for vengeance and vindication. Lenin's path from an underground cell to the podium of power began at a particular place in St. Petersbu rg: the student-run dining hall and library of the St. Petersb urg Technological Institute. The revolution ary seed first took root in the early 189os in this spot, where the young Lenin had his first contact both with the main Marxist classics and with real industrial workers . Within this small area of freedom students not only dreamed of a technologically abundant alternative to tsarism, but also used their technical talents to form the first Russian organiz ation of revolution ary Marxists. The road that was to lead from the Technological Institute to the Finland Station originated, however, earlier and elsewhere. The first green zone that fertilized the revolution ary seed by turning intellectuals into revolution aries was the Palais-Royal in the late 178os. This priv­ ileged Parisian sanctua ry of the reformist House of Orleans incubated those who wrested power from the ruling royal palace of Versailles in 1789 and from the Tuileries in 1792, long before the Leninists occupied the Winter Palace in 1917.

First came the slow growth of the idea of secular revolution in early modern Europe. Then came the fact of a totally new kind of upheaval within the largest city of the mightiest power in Europe. The Idea of Revolution Long before the Second Coming of 1917-and even before the Inc ar­ nation of 178g-men brooded about the nature and meaning of the word revolut ion. The term derives from the Latin substantive revolutio, which was unknown in classical Latin but was used in the early Middle Ages by St. Augustine and other Christian writers . 1 Translated into Italian as rivoluzione in the early Renaissance and then into French and English as revolution, the term initially meant the return of a moving object to its place of origin-particularly the movement of celestial bodies around the earth. Copernicans used it increasingly in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to describe their unsettling new concept of the earth revolvin g-axially and orbitally-a round the sun. The French savant Jacques Amyot suggested that in sixteenth-century France an understanding of these awesome movements in nature was also necessary for a successful politician : II y a une certaine revolution et prefixion de temps oultre lequel l'homme sage ne se doibt plus entremettre des affaires de la chose politique.� But \"revolutionary\" change was still generally seen as a return to an earlier, temporarily violated norm: a re-volution back to a more natural"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"FouNDATIONS OF THE REvoLUTIONARY FAITH order.3 Even the extremists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries who helped prepare revolutions tended to think of restoring preexisting rights and traditi ons. Judaeo-Christian ideas inspired what many con­ sider the first modern revolution: the Puritan rebellion in seventeenth­ century England; and nonconformist religious ideas played a major role in preparing the American revolution. 4 Fanatical religious ideologies dominated the sixteenth-century civil wars that raged within the two great continental powers, the Hapsburg Empire and the French King­ dom. Both sides in both of these conflicts have recently been hailed as revolutionary pioneers. The Dutch revolt against authoritarian Spain has been called the first modern revolution and \"the earliest modern expression of democratic ideas.\" \" Similar claims have also been made for an earlier revolt in which the roles were reversed, when urban Spaniards rebelled against the predominantly Dutch entourage of Charles V.6 A leading Calvinist in sixteenth-century France was \"one of the first modern revolutiona ries,\" 7 as was his bete noire, the Catholic League , which installed \"the first revolution ary reign of terror that Paris was to experienc e.\" 8 These Parisian Catholics were probably the most authentic anticipation of the modern revolution aries. They intro­ duced the term \"Committee of Public Safety, \" the use of barricades, and a program that was \"truly revolutionary in the sense that it embodied conscious social antagoni sms.\" H But such revolutionary means still served reactionary ends. Innovative political practices continued to require aggressively Christian ideolo­ gies. The grounds for a new approach were prepared by the exhaust ion with religious conflict and by the enthusiasm over the scientific method that produced a \"crisis of the European consciousness\" at the end of the seventeenth century. l o In the ensuing Enlightenment of the eigh­ teenth century, a critical spirit began to regard Greco-Roman antiquity as a kind of secular alternat ive to Christianity. 11 Much of the growing volume of secular political writing in the age of the Enlightenment dealt with the problem of revolution. A pioneering Italian work of 1629 on the causes and prevention of revolution found kingdoms particul arly vulnerable to revolution because of their mon­ archs' misconduct. 12 An anti-Spanish treatise, The Revolutions in Na­ ples, appeared in 1647 on the eve of an uprising in Naples led by the fisherman Masaniello against the Hapsburgs .l3 This event stimulated the already well-developed Italian discussion of political revoluti on.14 Po­ lemic writers in England during the Puritan Revolution drew in turn on Italian writings. One English work on the Neapolitan uprisi n g coined the classic revolution ary metaphor of a \"fire\" coming from a small \"spark.\" 1 5 The poet Robert Heath appears to have been the first to link political revolution with social change, 16 speaking of a \"strange Vertigo or De­ lirium o' the Brain\" drawing England into a revolution that went beyond politics : Nor doth the State alone on fortu ne's Wheeles Run round; Alas, our Rock Religion reeles."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Incarnation He then suggests that the hope of heaven on earth might replace that of heaven above: Amidst these turnings, 'tis some comfort yet, He aven doth not fly from us, though we from it. And finally comes the full new fantasy : Nothing but fine Utopian Worlds i' the Moon Must be new form'd by Revolution .17 Interest in the upheaval which restored moderate monarchy to England in 1688 led to a proliferation of anonymous historical studies in which the term \"glorious revolution\" was introduced to the continent. 18 In the New World as in the Old, revolution became for the first time a posi­ tive political ideal. The most dynamic of the \"enlightened despots,\" Frederick the Great, saw revolutions as part of the destiny of nations, particularly new ones. In 1751 he wrote that ... fragility and inst ability are inseparable from the works of men; the revolutions that monarchies and republics experience ha ve their causes in the immutable laws of Nature. 19 Frederick generally used the word \"revolution\" in the old sense of re­ volving back to where nations had been before. But he also began the trend among German thinkers of applying the word to spiritual as well as political change. He said of the Lutheran Reform ation: A revolution so great and so singular, which changed almost the entire System of Europe, deserves to be examined with Philosophical eyes.2 o Later Germans, such as Hegel and Marx were, of course, to use just such \"philosophical eyes\" to see in the liberating reforms of both Luther and Frederick antecedents of the modern, ideologically based revolu­ tionary tradition . Frederick the Great's interest in revolution as a spiritual and political event subtly influenced many Germans of his time. He created in Prus­ sia a sense of new Promethean possibilitie s. His impatience with tra­ dition in affairs of state was echoed in the republic of letters by the rebellious poets of the Sturm und Drang. Radical Bavarian Illuminists urged in the early 178os that his secularizing reforms be carried even further through an \"imminent revolution of the human mind.\" 21 Their opponents, in turn, already saw in such a program in 1786 the threat of an \"imminent universal revolution.\" 22 Thus Germany-not France-gave birth to the sweeping, modern idea of revolution as a secular upheaval more universal in reach and more transforming in scope than any purely political change. This concept was transported to Paris by Count Mirabeau, a former French ambas­ sador in Berlin; it helped him to become the leading figure in the early events of the French Revolution in 1789. His study of Frederick the Great in 1788 had proclaimed Prussia the likely site of a coming revo-"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"20 FouNDATIONS oF THE REVOLUTIONARY FAITH lution , and the German Illuminists its probable leaders. 2 3 Mirabeau's speeches and writings the following year transferred these expectations of a deep transformation from Germany to France . He became both the leader in turning the Third Estate of the Estates-General into a new National Assembly and \"the first to succeed in launching a journal without the authorization of the government.\" 2 4 His reputation as the outstanding orator of the Assembly is closely related to his pioneering role in convincing the French that their revolution, though political in form, was redemptive in content. Mirabeau popularized the Illuminist term \"revolution of the mind,\" introduced the phrase \"great revolu­ tion,\" 2 5 and apparently invented the words \"revolutionary,\" 2 6 \"counter­ revolution,\" and \"coun ter-revol utionary.\" 2 7 Mirabeau pioneered in ap­ plying the evocative language of traditional religion to the new political institutions of revolutionary France. As early as May 10, 1789, he wrote to the constituents who had elected him to the Third Estate that the purpose of the Estates-General was not to reform but \"to regenerate\" the nation. 2 s He subsequently called the National Assembly \"the in­ violable priesthood of national policy,\" the Declarat ion of the Rights of Man \"a political gospel,\" and the Constitution of 1791 a new religion \"for which the people are ready to die .\" 29 The introduction of the hitherto little-used word revolut ion into the German language sealed the new and quasi-religious usage of the word. Writers and lexicographers initially either bragged or complained, ac­ cording to their politics , that \"we Germans wish so hard to keep [rev­ olution] distant that we do not have even one word for it in our vocab­ ulary\"; and the French word was introduced into German precisely \"to convey in its nature an impossible movement with speed and quick­ ness\" -to inspire awe and suggest a novelty beyond the traditional word for political upheaval , Umwiilzung . 3 o We shall return to this faith in revolution as something totally new, secular, and regenerative-and to the occult, Germanic sources of this idea. But first, we must briefly consider the events of the French Rev­ olution themselve s. For the convulsions that began in Paris in 1789 represented an unprecedented success ion of novelties that made Mira­ beau's new conception of revolution believable. With mounting intensity and without any clear plan or continuous leadership, France proceeded to create a new political lexicon centered on the word \"democracy\" 3 1 and on a new understanding of revolution as a superhuman source of fresh dynamism for human history.32 The Fact of Revolution In the summer of 1789, absolute monarchy and aristocratic authority were overthrown forever in the most powerful kingdom in Chr istendom. This was the essential French Revoluti on: the hard fact that gave birth"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Incarnation 21 to the modern belief that secular revolution is historically possible. This unplanned political transformation occurred within a period of exactly five months- between May 5, when King Louis XVI opened in Ver­ sailles the first Estates-General to meet in 175 years, and October 5, when the king was brought back to Paris as a virtual prisoner of the mob. The decisive event of these five months was the Third Estate (which represented everyone except the clergy and nobility and was dominated by articulate middle-class lawyers) declaring itself to be the National Assembly. Members of the other two estates went over to join the Third Estate; it resolved in the \"tennis-court oath\" of June 20 to remain in being \"until the constitution of the realm is s et up and consolidated on firm foundations.\" Following the violence in Paris that led to the storming of the Bastille on July J4, a \"great fear\" spread through the countrys ide. Fires destroyed many records and symbols of the manorial system. In the course of August the Assembly abolished serfdom and aristocratic privilege and proclaimed the \"natural and imprescribable\" right of every citizen to liberty, equality, property, and security. News of a political act-the king's dismissal of his reformist Finance Minister Necker-had fired the original unrest in Paris. Nine days after the Bastille fell the Paris mob hung Necker's successor, and political authority was restored by the Marquis de Lafayette. He arrived on a white horse-literally as well as symbolically-and took military com­ mand of Paris on July I 5, lending legitimacy to upheaval, and serving with Mirabeau as a founding father of the revolution ary tradition. Wounded at age nineteen while fighting for American independence in the Battle of Brandywi ne, Lafayette had returned to France hoping that the American Revolution \"might serve as a lesson to the oppres­ sors and an example to the oppressed\" in the Old World.3\" He pre­ sented a key to the Bastille to Washington, used American rhetoric to help draft the Declarat ion of the Rights of Man and Citizen, 3 4 and lent dignity as head of the new national guard to the fateful march on Ver­ sailles on October 5· Yet this seeming guarantor of continuing order amidst revolution ary change was soon denounced not just by the Right, but by the Left as well. Burke's conservative attack on the French Revolution listed \"Fayet­ tism\" first among the \"rabble of systems.\" R5 On the revolutiona ry side, \"Gracchus\" Babeuf, just a year after the fall of the Bastille, excoriated Lafayette as a conceited and antidemocratic brake on the revolution ary process.3 6 Later revolutionar ies, as we shall see, repeatedly raged against him. Mirabeau, also a marquis but less elegant than Lafayette, was more central to the early revolution ary events. Rejected by his fellow aristo­ crats for election to the Estates-Gener al, the pock-m arked Mirabeau ac­ cepted election by the Third Estate; he infused it with la passion politique. The constitutional monarchy favored by Lafayette and Mirabeau could not survive the attempt of the king to flee Paris in the summer of 1791 and the outbreak of foreign war in the spring of 1792.

External and internal violence in­ creasingly polarized politics and split the National Assembly into the original \"right\" and \"left.\" 37 The subsequent equation of the left with virtue dramatized revolutionary defiance of Christian tradition , which had always represented those on the right hand of God as saved and those on the left as damned.3 8 During this time the armed masses in Paris tended increasingly to reject the politics of the Assembly, arguing that Le Cote Droit est toujours gauche Et le gauche n'est jamais droit .3 9 The crowd that had invaded the Tuileries Palace to imprison the king on August 10, 1792, broke into the Assembly on May 31, 1793, and in the summer mobilized in the levee en masse to resist counter-revolution­ ary foes in the countryside and on the borders. The subsequent history of the armed revolution reveals a seemingly irresistible drive toward a strong, central executive. Robespierre's twelve­ man Committee of Public Safety (I 793-94) gave way to a five-man Di­ rectorate (1795-99), to a three-man Consulate, to the designat ion of Napoleon as First Consul in 1799, and finally to Napoleon's coronation as emperor in I 804. After 1792 a growing split developed between the stated ideals of the revolution ary republic and their practical implementation. Marxists have represented this conflict as the inevitable clash of the \"proletar­ ian\" quest for a social revolution and the \"bourgeois\" desire to consol­ idate newly acquired property rights and political power. But social consciousness at the time was focused on the shared hatred of foreign­ ers and arist ocrats; and in pre-industrial Paris the distinction between the working and middle classes was not yet clear. The more signific ant split was between the political consciousness of the articulate lawyers and leaders of revolutionary France and the mundane, apolitical demands of the urban masses for food, security, and something to believe in. The leaders repeatedly failed to satisfy the Parisian populace. La­ fayette, who in April 1792 had favored war in order to rally France be­ hind the constitutional monarchy , was soon drowned out by the more bellicose and radical Brissot. The Brissotists, or Girondi sts, were in turn swept aside by the more extreme Jacobins in the late spring of 1793. The relatively moderate Jacobinism of Danton was then supplanted by Robespier re; his reign of terror claimed some forty thousand domestic victims in 1793-94. Yet none of these figures was able to bring stability. Robespierre, the most radical political leader of the revolutiona ry era, was also the first to turn decisively against the Paris mob. He broke up its sectional assemblies in the fall of 1793 and executed the extreme enrages or Hebertists in the spring of 1794-shortly before he too was guillotined in July. The retrenchment that followed, the so-called Ther­ midorean reaction, checked a seemingly inexorable drift to the left. The new republican Constitution of 1795 was far less radical than that written in 1793 (but never put in effect). Two years later the attempt"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Incarnation 2 3 of the Babeuf conspiracy to organize a new revolutionary uprising was crushed by the five-man Directory with no difficulty. Though Napoleon rose to power through the revolutionary army and used revolution ary ideas to expand French power, he (like the constitutional monarchs who were restored to power after him) was generally seen not as an heir to the revolution but as its repudiator. The revolution ary tradition reached maturity when fighting broke out again on the streets of Paris against the restored Bourbons in July 1830. Lafayette, by then an old man, emerged to legitimize a return to con­ stitutional monarchy, and helped establish in power Louis Philippe of the House of Orlea ns. The linkage was deeply appropri ate. For the original revolution of 1789 that had been led by Lafayette can in a sense be said to have begun in the Parisian pleasure dome of Louis Philippe's father, Philip of Orleans: the Palais-Royal. There in the shadow of the Tuileries Palace, Philip had decided to accept the revolution and rename himself Egalite rather than remain loyal to his cousin, King Louis XVI. It was this Philip who renamed the great public gardens of the Palais­ Royal-in which the mob that stormed the Bastille first formed-\"the garden of equality.\" And it is in this revolutionary garden of Eden, this unlikely Bethlehem, that the story of the revolutionary faith prop­ erly begins."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 A Locus of Legitimacy AS PARIS overthrew the old regime, its citizens felt an almost desperate need for some new source of authority. The story of this need is usually told in terms of political or social forces , but it can also be told in terms of an ideological and geographical search for legitimacy. If one were to use a single word to describe what the original French revolutionaries were really seeking, it might well be a key term later used by the Russians : opros tit'sia, to simplify. The desire for radical simplification (even of oneself as the reflexive verb suggests in Rus­ sian) impelled intellectuals following Rousseau to reject personal pre­ tention as well as social convention. A similar striving toward simplicity compelled politicians leading up to Robespierre to rely increasingly on liquidation as well as inspiration. At the root of everything lay the pas­ sionate desire of thinking people to find a simple, unifying norm for society like the law of gravity that Newton had found for nature. In their drive toward revolutionary simplicity Frenchmen melded many estates into one state; discarded innumerable titles for the uni­ form \"citizen,\" \"brother,\" and \"tu \" ; supplanted elaborate rococo art with a severe neo-classic ism; discarded complex Catholic traditions in the name of Dame Nature or a Supreme Being; and replaced reasoned argument with incantational slogan. The early revolution ary call for \"one king, one law, one weight, one me asure\" prefigured later French evangelism in spreading the use of the metric and decimal systems .1 Throughout the inventive revolution ary era, new symbols and societies seemed to be searching for le point parfa it: \"the perfect point\" within a \"circle of friends.\" These were the strangely appropriate names of two leading Masonic lodges that flourished in Paris during the Reign of Terror. 2 But where was the \"perfect point\" on which to base a new secular faith?

Precisely under Napoleon, however, the professional"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"A Locus of Legitimacy revolutionary tradition began. The appearance of conspiracies within Napoleon's armies at the height of his power revealed an unsatisfied revolution ary thirst for something more than pure power. Violence was part of what revolutionaries sought- and was in many ways their ultimate form of radical simplific ation. A thousand hopes and hatreds could be compressed into a single act of blood ritual, trans­ forming philoso phe.s into r�§vol utionnaire s. As the darkest mystery of the revolution ary faith, violence was at first mainly discussed by reac­ tionary oppone nts, who saw the revolutionaries preempting the promise of ancient religions to provide salut par le sang.3 Revolution ary violence has been best described metaphorically as a volcanic eruption or the birth pain of a new order. Because revolutionaries always believe their violence will end all violence, it might also be described as the sonic boom at which controls must be reversed, the vortex of a whirlpool in which a helplessly descending object may suddenly be hurled up to freedom. The mark of blood distinguishes real revolution from mythic melo­ drama about the storming of a Bastille or a Winter Palace. The drama resembles rather that of a medieval passion play-in which, however, the act of crucifixion rather than the fact of resurrection provides le point parfait for a new beginning. Belief in a purely secular salvation leads the modern revolution ary to seek deliverance through human destruction rather than divine redemption. We shall trace the course of revolutionary violence from a romantic, Italo-Polish phase in the early nineteenth century to an ascetic Russian form in the late nine­ teenth and early twentieth centuries. Yet the same lava that was to destroy a decadent Pompeii was also to fertilize a new Eden. The original search for revolution ary legitimacy involved not just the razing of a Bastille and beheading of a king, but also the quest for sacred space in which perfection might appear and oracles might speak. The story can be traced through both places and people. It begins in the cafes of the Palais-Royal and leads on to the neglected figure of Nicholas Bonneville. The Cafes of the Palais-Royal Nowhe re-the literal meaning of Utopia-first became somew here in the Palais-Royal. In the cafes that ringed the gardens of this great royal enclosu re in central Paris, the \"heavenly city of the eighteenth­ century philosophers\" found earthly roots; high ideals were translated into coarse conversati on; salon sophistication became bourgeois bra­ vado; reform moved through revolt to revoluti on.

The"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"FouNDATIONs oF THE REVOLUTIONARY FAITH palace was transformed into an enclosed complex of galleries, exhibi­ tion halls, and entertainment centers in the early I78os-a nd was opened to the public by the reform-minded Philip of Orleans. His avarice rapidly converted it into a profitable center of pleasure where \"all desires can be gratified as soon as conceived.\"4 In the late spring of I787, Philip built Le Cirque-a large oval enclosure more than one hundred meters long in the middle of the garden-for large meetings and sporting events. The cafes in the arcades and the \"circus\" in the center of the Palais­ Royal incubated an intellectual opposition that went beyond the mild, Whiggish reformism of the London coffeehouses that the House of Or ­ leans had originally sought to imitate. The Palais-Royal became \"a sor t of Hyde Park of the French Capital,\" \"the place where public opinion is formed,\" \"the agora of the city in ferment,\" \"the forum of the French Revolution .\" 5 If the French Revolution can be said to have begun in any single spot at any single moment, it may have been in the gardens of the Palais-Royal at about 3:30 in the afternoon of Sunday, July I2, I7 89, when Camille Desmoulins climbed up on a table and cried Aux armes! to the milling crowd. He was suggesting a collective Parisian response to the news that had just come from Versailles about the king's dismissal of Necker. Within half an hour of his speech, the crowd began coursing out onto the streets carrying busts of Necker and the Duke of Orleans.n The moment was dramatic-in the most intense and literal sense of the word. The Palais-Royal had attracted an expectant audience. A minor operatic composer had set the stage, helping Desmoulins to mount what he called la table magique taken from the Cafe Foy. A green ribbon attached to Desmoulins's hat (by some accounts a green leaf plucked from a tree) provided the new costume : a badge of nature and of hope to brandish against the unnatural emblems of a hopeless aristocracy. The urban hero was (like Saint-Just and Babeuf to come ) an intellectual journalist from rural Picardy. In response to his harangue, the sup­ porting cast of hundreds spilled out into the streets. Their immediate purpose was the demonically appropriate one of forcing all the theaters in Paris to cancel their evening perform ances-as if to remove from the city any drama that might rival their own. Having shut the theaters , they converged on the greatest open square in Europe, the Place Louis XV, which they helped transform into a theater of revoluti on. Under the equestrian statue of the king's father, the crowd bran­ dished the busts of the king's dismissed minister and of his suspect cousin. The first act of the revolut ion/drama began at 8 P.M. in the square when stray fire from royal troops created the first martyrs of the revolution and the mob responded by sacking nearby armories. The drama was to return repeate dly to this great, open-air theater for its climactic scenes: the execution of the king in January 1793 (with the setting renamed Place de la Revolution ), and the Easter liturgy cele­ brated by Tsar Alexander for the entire Russian army after the final defeat of Napoleon in ISIS (r enamed again as Place de la Concorde ).

The ultimate destination of the crowd that first acquired an identity on July 12 was, of course, the sparsely popu­ lated prison and armory known as the Bastille; but their original as­ sembly point had been the Palais-Royal. Located about halfway between the Place Louis XV and the Place de la Bastille, the Palais continued to play a central role in the choreography of conflict during the early years of the revolution. The habitues of the Palais were, in a way, the original \"people\" of revolutionary rhetoric; and the mob that assembled there periodically, the model for revolutionary mobilization . By early August, police were coming from other sections of the city to deal with the disorders reigning in the Palais-Royal and the dangers that could result from them.7 If the Palais-Royal was not yet unified behind the republicanism of Desmouli ns, it echoed the Anglophilia of the Duke of Orleans in hail­ ing the events in France as \"cette glorieuse Revolution.\" s Petitions against a royal veto were carried to the assembly in Versailles from the \"citizens assembled in the Palais-Royal,\" 9 who constituted themselves as a kind of informal voice of revolutionary authority in the city. Songs in praise of the soldiers said to have refused orders to fire on the people were im­ provised \"in the name of the citizens of the Palais-Royal .\" lo \"Lacking a King, Paris found a chief in the Palais-R oyal.\" u The locus of legitimacy was the critical issue, and the ultimate pro­ tagonists were the king's court at Versailles on the one hand and the headless \"forum of the people\" in the Palais-Royal at Paris on the other. Standing between them, however, in the summer of 1789 were the newly constituted National Assembly, still under the king's shadow at Versailles, and the formal government of Paris, still at the Hotel de Ville, on the Rue de Rivoli, halfway between the Palais-Royal and the Bas­ tille. On August 30 a crowd of fifteen hundred set off from the Palais­ Royal to the Hotel de Ville for the first of two unsucces sful petitions to gain official backing for a march on Versail les.12 Finally, on Sunday, October 4, 1789, a large group formed in the Palais-Royal ; it was joined by other Pa risians to march on Versailles the following day, and brought both the king and the National Assembly back to Paris. Paris itself thereafter became the battlefield. The king resided in the Tuileries Palace; popular authority, in the Palais-Royal just across the Rue Saint-Honore. The National Assembly was relocated close to both in the drafty building of the former royal riding academy overlooking the Tuileries gardens. The terminology used to charact erize factions within the assembly revealed a thirst for the spatial sanctificat ion of immaterial ideals. Le­ gitimacy was identified with a physic al location: \"left\" or \"right,\" \"moun· tain\" or \"plain.\" The middle position in the assembly between the two extremes became known as \"the swamp\" ( le marais ): the morass oc­ cupied by those unfit for either land or sea. One of the earliest histor­ ians of the revolution characterized le marais in polarized terms that anticipated later revolutionaries' denunciation of the \"center\" as \"un-"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"FOUNDATIONS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY FAITH principl ed,\" \"opportunistic,\" and lacking the conviction of either right or left : Be tween these two extremes, men of secret votes and silent cowardice stagnate, always devoted to the strongest party and serving the powers that be. The place occupied by these eunuchs in the Convention was called the Swamp; it is called the Center in modern assem blie s. 1 3 Then, with the division of Paris into forty-eight sections on June 22, 17 90, the Hotel de Ville was effectively superseded by a new form of popula r govern ment : the Commune of the Paris sectio ns ; and the Section of the Pa lais-Royal (la ter called the Section de la Montag ne ) became the largest sectional government in the center of the city. 1 4 News of divisions and debates in the National Assembly often came first from participants relating their accounts at the nearby cafes in the Palais­ Royal . Rumors were ma nufactured there that the king was planning to flee France by assuming ma sked disguises or by digging a secret canal to Saint Cloud. 1 5 The Palais-Royal played a central role in revolutionary Paris for three reasons. It offered, first of all, a privileged sanctua ry for intellectuals where they could turn from speculation to organization. Second, its owner and patron , the Duke of Orlea ns, represented the point through which new ideas broke into the power elite of the old regime. Finally, the Pa lais provided a living link with the unde rworld of Paris and with the new social forces that had to be mobilized for any revolution ary victory. Royal ownership assured immunity from arrest within the Palais­ Royal; and from 17 88 to 17 92 a host of new organizations were formed and key meetings held there. Amidst the ferment of 17 89 literary and artistic talent was rallied to the revolution by pioneering, if often short­ lived, clu bs : the Lycee de Paris, Lycee des Arts, Musee Frangais, Athe­ naum, and Club de 17 89. 16 The revolution ary theater found a home there first in the Theatre des Varietes, which had opened in 17 85, and then in the new Theatre de la Republique to which many outstanding actors of the na tional theater, including the legend ary Talm a, moved in 17 92. The mob that burst forth from the Pa lais-Royal in July 17 89, carried a bust of Philip of Orleans along with one of Necker , and the mob that went to Versailles in October also acclaimed the king's cousin. As the owner of the Pa lais-Royal, Philip was seen as a pat ron of the revolu­ tionary cause within the royal elite. His journey to London later in 17 89 was seen by some as part of an Anglophile's ma neuvering to move France closer to constitutional monarchy. Philip had written his own Regu lation of Life for the Palais-Royal in Febru ary 17 89; among other things it called for formal Wednesday evening soirees of twenty-five thinkers ,17 His personal spon sorship of the Musee Frangais in his apartment and of various publications as well as open-a ir dramas in the gardens of the Pa lais led many conservatives to assume that the revolution ary tumult was in some sense the result of an Orleanist conspiracy."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"A Locus of Legitimacy 2 9 Shortly after the proclamation of a republic on September 15, 17 92, Philip of Orleans presented himself to the new communal government of Paris with a request to be renamed Egalite, and to have the garden of the Palais called the \"garden of equality.\" 18 He paid tribute to his experience as a Freemason for providing him with a \"sort of image of equality,\" but gave thanks that he had now \"left behind the phantom for the reality.\" 19 The rebaptized head of the House of Orleans was then elected a mem­ ber of the Convention -over Robespierre's opposition. Two months later a decree of the Convention challenged the sincerity of Philip's con­ version , suggesting that he \"speculated on the revolution as on his jockies\" and had simply acted in a way \"most convenient to his inter­ ests.\" �0 Jean Paul Marat cast further doubt on Philip's \"civic dedication\" ( civisme ). When a revolutionary leader was assassinated in the Palais­ Royal on January 20, suspicion of Philip deepened, and the Conven­ tion unleashed a kind of storm-trooper organization, the so-called de­ fenders of the republic, for raids on the Orleanist redoubt. 21 When Philip's son, the future King Louis Philippe, defected to the counter­ revolutionary camp together with General Charles Franc;ois Dumouriez in the early spring, Philippe-Egalite was arrested-and eventually guil­ lotined on November 6, 17 93. The Palais-Royal was the center in Paris not just of high politics and high ideals, but also of low pleasure. Along with the \"political effer­ vescence\" fostered by \"agitators whose mysterious existence seems more appropriate for a novel than for reality\" appeared raucous pub­ lications that mixed politics and pornography, such as The National Bordello under the sponsorsh ip of the Queen, for the use of Provincial confederates. 2 2 Philipp e-Egalite once again showed the way. His long­ time mistress, Mme. de Genlis (later Citoyenne Bn1lart ), was a kind of princess among the prostitutes of the Palais as well as a \"governess of the princes.\" The new personal secreta ry he brought to the Palais in I788, Choderlos de Laclos, was the author of Les Liaisons Dangereuses and a pioneer of the liberated pornography that flourished during the revolution ary era.23 Laclos's friend, the Marquis de Sade, opened a book­ store in the Palais during the turmoil to sell his dark masterpieces; every form of sexual gratification that he described was available in the cafes and apartments of the Palais complex. The gardens were the gathering place for prostitutes, and respect able women did not appear in the Palais-Royal after I I: oo A.M.24 Even before the revolution , the Palais-Royal had generated a counter-morality of its own. A defiant pros­ titute who refused to give herself to the Comte d'Artois became a folk heroine, and a cafe, La Venus, was named in her honor. 2 5 The prome­ nade of boutiques and galleries in the center of the Palais where con­ tacts and assignations were usually made (the so-called Gall erie de Bois or Camp des Tartares) had as its central sculpture \"la belle Zulima,\" 2 n a wax statue of a naked woman done in realistic flesh color. Cafes were the heart and soul of the Palais-Royal. About two dozen ringed the Palais-Royal and beckoned strollers from the gardens into the arcaded pleasure spots which were-literally as well as figura-"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"3 0 FouNDATIONs OF THE REVOLUTIONARY FAITH tively-the underground of Paris. Like the Cirque in the middle of the gardens (five-eighths of which was dug out below ground level ), the cafes were mostly undergroun d. Some of the most important names­ Cafe du Cav eau, Cafe des Aveugles, and Cafe du Sauvage-suggest the fetid air, mysterious darkness , and indulgent abandon that character­ ized these subterranean retreats. The Cafe des Aveugles offered twenty separate \"caves\" for the sexual and narcotic delectat ions of its custom­ ers, who usually descended there after lighter, alcoholic preliminaries at the Cafe Italien directly above. 2 7 For those who remained in, or re­ turned to, the Cafe Italien (also known as the Corazza) passions turned political, and politics became international because of its large Italian clientele. The verb \"to politic\" (politiquer) may even have originated in the cafe language of the Palais. 2 8 A special kind of politics emerged in this ambience. Playful irreverance and utopian speculation were preferred to pedestrian practicality. It was not the politics of those responsible for exercising power in the National Assembly or within the Paris Sec­ tions. It was a politics of desire fashioned over drinks that induced blissful oblivion, such as the non-lo-s apraye (fractured Italian for \"You will never know it\"), and after sweets designed for gluttons (such as the ice-cream confections of the Cafe Tortoni ). 2 9 The cafes of the Palais-Royal were also filled with votive objects of the emerging new faith in the applied science s. In the Cafe Mecanique, \"the ancestor of our automatic bars,\" 30 drinks appeared from trap doors, which were part of an elaborate set of levers and other devices illus­ trating various principles of Newtonian physics. Illusion became real­ ity in the Cafe des Milles Colonnes, where mirrors magnified a few columns into a thousand. The stove that warmed the Cafe Italien was shaped like the pioneering balloon flown by Joseph Montgolfier, who himself frequented the cafe.31 This complex of cafes made the Palais-Royal seem, to the most acute observer of Paris on the eve of revolution, the capital of Paris, a sumptuous little city within a large one; the temple of voluptuous ness.32 The sanctuary within this temple was the Cafe Foy, before which Des­ moulins issued his famous call to arms on July 12, 1789. The Foy was the only cafe that had both the privilege of serving tables within the garden and control of a passag eway out of it onto the Rue de Richelieu. Thus, it became the \"portico of the Revolution,\" 3 3 the precise point at which Desmoulins's followers first moved from talk to action on the streets : During these months of excitement, the Cafe Foy was to the Palais-Royal, what the Palais-Royal was to Paris: a little capital of agitation within the kingdom of agitation.34 The Foy earned a mantle of martyrdom when it was shut down briefly by the king later in 1789, and the cafes of the Palais-Royal continued"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"A Locus of Legitimacy 3 1 to politicize the populace of Paris in emotion ally satisfying wa ys that neither the National Assembly nor the sectional governments could al­ together duplicate. As one relatively neutral observer wrote in 1791 : When a post erity more reflective and enlightened than the present gen­ eration studies the history of the French Revolution dispassionately, it will not be able to believe that cafes became the supreme trib unals within a city at the center of a free state. The Ca fe de Foy and the Cafe du Ca veau ... are today two republics in which the most pronounced intolerance takes the name of pa trio tism. s 5 In this period \"cafes grew and formed clubs; their tables became tri­ bunals ; their habitues, orators ; their noises, motions.\" 36 As the qu arre ling among revolution aries became more intense , each faction tended to have its own cafe within the Palais- serving as both outpost and headquarters. The Cafe du Caveau was a gathering place for the Girondists who prepared the demonstrations of August 10, 1792, that overthrew the mona rchy and est ablished the First Republic. The Cafe It alien was an assembly point for the more radical J acobins who eventu ally occupied the National Assembly and est ablished the revolu­ tionary dict atorship in the early summer of 1793.3 7 But the Jacobins operated ma inly outside the Palais, deriving the name for their nationwide organization from the Jacobin monastery where the Parisian leaders first met. The Jacobin politicians were deeply sus­ picious of the Palais-Royal because of its obvious lack of discipline and at the same time out of con trary fear that it might ultimately fall subject to the discipline of a potential claimant to the thro ne : Philip of Orlea ns. They fe ared not only the royalis ts , who also controlled cafes within the Palais, but also the foreign friends of the Revolution who enjoyed the hospitality of the Palais-Royal. Thus, during the na ­ tionalistic mobilization of 1793, when all Paris became a theater of political conflict, the J acobin dict atorship of Robespi erre curtailed the freedom of the Palais-Royal. The cafe headqu arters for the Jacobins and Babeuvists were some distance away on the left bank. Thus, long before the Cirque was burned down in 1798, and the cafes cleaned out by Na poleon in r8o2, the Palais-Royal lost its centrality. But why was the Palais-Royal able to mobilize mass emotions so suc­ cess fully during the early years before full state power and military emergency could be invoked against it? The truth seems to be that the cafes provided not just a protected place for political meetings, but also the intoxicating ambiance of an earthly utopia. Distinctions of rank were obliter ated, and men were free to exercise sexual as well as politi­ cal free dom. In the course of a single visit, one might sip such libations of liberation as a new tricolored liquor, savor foreign foods in perfumed boites, see the laterna magica trace the history of the world in the apart­ ment of Philip pe-Egalite, visit a quasi-pornog raphic wax museum in the arc ades, attend a melodrama which included music and acrobatics in the Cirque, and then go underground for entertainment that ranged from ven triloquism by a dwar f to sex with the seven-foot two-inch Prus­ sian prostitute, Mlle.

Hedonist ic awakening was combined with politi­ cal and intellectual discussion in an atmosphere of social equa lity and directness of communication that had been unknown among the aris­ tocratic conventions of the old regi me. All races were represented among the servants, entertainers, and shopkeepers of the Palais. Two blacks (known as Aladin and Scipio ) were revered rather in the manner of court \"fools\" during the Renaiss ance, and were even called upon to resolve confiicts .39 The form of communication was egalitarian . The often scatological language of the cafes was incorporated into plays produced by the Duke of Orleans in his \"garden of equality.\" His so­ called genre Poissard introduced irreverent forms of speech that soon found their way into revolution ary journalism. The Palais-Royal was an intensely verbal place, infecting Paris and all of France with its revolutionary rhetoric and iconoclastic speech. As one pamphlet noted already in r 790 : The Palais-Royal is a theater, which imprints a great movement on the capital and on all the provinces of the French kingdom! 40 The anonymous writer was describing an incident in which Mirabeau had been challenged by a mob in the Pala is ; and the implication was that legitimacy lay no longer with the orator of the Assembly , who hides \"under the mask of na tional interes t,\" but with the spontaneous people in the Palais.41 The Palais had become not just \"the temple of patriotism and wisdom,\" but also the point of combustion for la revolution senti­ mentale: that \"immense and quas i-universal explosion of sensi bility\" that began with Rousseau and helped transform a political crisis into an emotion-charged upheaval. \"From May to October r 789, there is no scene ... which did not end in tears and embra ces .\" And many of those scenes began in the Pala is-Royal : ... a sacred temple where the sublime sounds resound in celebration of this revolution that is so happy for the French nation and of such good augury for the entire universe.42 Within the cafe a small group of trusted friends often met at a table and gradually formed a basic new unit for revolutionary activity : the \"circ le .\" Mercier noted that even before the outbreak of revolution in 1789 ... the taste for circles, unknown to our fathers and copied from the En­ glish, has begun to become naturaliz ed.43 Unlike the English, the French in the Pa lais-Royal became \"grave and serious once gathered in a circle .\" 44 A small group could move beyond the surface conviviality of the cafe to deeper dedication in a circ le : unified by the pursuit of truth, a sharing of inner thoughts, and the \"strength of a uniform equality.\" 45"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"A Locus of Legitimacy 33 The most important such body to appear in the Palais-Royal during the turbulent and creative early years of the revolution was the Social Circle ( Cercle Social ), which was in some ways the prototype for the revolutionary organizations of the future. Its founder , Nicholas Bonne­ ville, was as important and innovative in his day as he has been ne­ glected since. It is to this remarkable figure that attention must now be turned. Nich olas Bonn eville and Oracular Journalism Editorial offices no less than cafes were breeding grounds of the new revolutionary faith. Indeed, at almost every crucial point of the French Revolution , journalists stood at center stage-or perhaps left-center, with active political leaders slightly to their right. The Abbe Sieyes, a denizen of the Palais-Royal 4 G and a leading voice of the Third Estate in 1789, suggested that the Fourth Estate of jour­ nalism may have been even more important than the Third: The printing press has changed the fate of Europe ; it will change the fate of the world .... The press is for the immense spaces of today what the voice of the orator was on the public squa re in Athens and Rome.47 The Fourth Estate in many ways replaced the First, the Church. In revolutionary France journalism rapidly arrogated to itself the Church's former role as the propagator of values, models, and symbols for society at large. Indeed, the emergence of dedicated , ideological revolutionaries in a traditional society (in Russia of the 186os no less than in France of the 1790s) depended heavily on literate priests and seminarians be­ coming revolution ary journalis ts. Like church-state relations in an ear­ lier era, the relations between the journalists and the politicians of revolution involved both deep interdependence and periodic conflict. The new breed of intellectual journalist during the French Revolution created both the basic sense of legitimacy and the forms of expression for the modern revolution ary tradition . Journalism was the only income­ producing profession practiced by Marx, Lenin, and many other leading revolutionaries during their long years of powerlessness and exile. The story of the link between journalism and revolution-one to which we shall repeatedly return-began with the sudden imposition at the on­ set of the revolution of two new conditions on journalists : the granting of unprecedented civil liberties and the assignment of broad new tasks of civic mobilization. The idea that events in France were part of a process greater than the sum of its parts was popularized by the new journals which sprang up in 1789 like Revo lutions de France et de Brabant and Revolutions de Paris. When the latter ceased publication in February 1794, it pro­ claimed that the people were now in power and that la revolution est"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"3 4 FOUNDATIONS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY FAITH faite .4B But by then the Reign of Terror was at its height, and a new species of journalist-agitator had educated the masses to believe that the revolution was not at all completed : they were men like the Swiss­ Sardinian doctor Jean Paul Marat and the Norman libertine Jacques­ Rene Hebert, who had begun his journalistic career while serving as a ticket seller at the Theatre des Varietes in the Palais-Royal. Marat broke the unspoken taboo against using the press to call openly for violence against fellow French men.49 He institutionalized the per­ petual denunciat ion of traitors-often writing from hiding or exile in his L'Ami du Peuple. He in many ways anticipated and validated the main ideas of the Jacobin dictatorship -attacking both the Girondists and the Palais-Roy al. When murdered in his bath on the eve of Bastille Day, 1793, he became a martyr of the uncompleted revolution and was transfigured immediately into an icon by David's famous painting. Five other journals appeared to perpetuate Marat's title; two others called themselves Veritables Amis du Peuple .5° The more earthy Hebert provided the people not with a fri end, but with a spokesma n: the coarse but candid \"Father Duchene,\" a figure of folklore well-known in the vaudevilles of Paris and in the cafes of the Palais-Royal. Hebert delivered his own editorials in the rough language of this mythical personality, who became a kind of Everyman for the Parisian mob and lent his name to Hebert's newspaper, Pere Duchene ; he inspired even more imitators than Marat.5 1 Hebert popularized the revolutionary technique of anathematizing people not as individuals but rather for the sins they allegedly personifi ed: Brissot isme, Buzotisme, and so forth. 5 2 Pere Duchene reached beyond the realm of commenta ry and even of agitation to exercise for brief moments direct revolutionary leader­ ship. Hebert had found the secret of arousin g the animal instincts of the mob through the power of the printed page. The appeal of Pere Duchene 53 was so great that he reappeared in every revolution of ninetee nth-century France along with Mere Duchene, Les Fils du Pere Duchene, and so forth. This rough-hewn personification of the revolution was more than merely the hero of a popular morality play or the mouthpiece for the left wing of the revolution. He represented a ritual desecration of au­ thority, something that was as important to the cultural revolution as was the legal change in authority to the political revolution. The cele­ brated profanity in Hebert's journal not only appealed to the masses, but also encouraged them to overthrow the secret tyranny of language exercised by aristocratic French and its elaborate conventions of clas­ sical restraint. The forbidden words of Hebert both heralded and legiti­ mized formerly forbidden acts carried out during the Reign of Terror. Many early, aristocratic supporters of the revolution had their tongues silenced by Hebert before their heads were removed by Hebert's readers. Along with the seizure of power, there came a \" seizure of speech,\" a prise de parole. Indeed, the four-letter outbursts of the youthful demon­ strators in the late Ig6os echoed the political shock tactics of Hebert, who"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"A Locus of Legitimacy 35 . .. never began a number of the Pere Duchene without putting in a foutre or bougre. This gross vulgarity signified nothing but signaled ... a total revolutionary situation [by using language] . . . to impose something be­ yond language which is both history and the part one is to play in it. 54 In a highly verbal culture linguistic shock was essential to the sustaining of the revolutionary spirit. The intimidating effect of aristo­ cratic or academic speech had to be shattered by . . . the seizure of the for bidden word, that which the esta blished order proscribes because it destroys its legitimacy. The word which is both hid­ den and for bidden; the word which has been buried under accumulated generations of alluvial respectabi lity.55 Hebert cut through these layers with a vulgarity that fed the rage of the Parisian populace when food supplies ran low late in the winter of 1793-94. In demanding social controls and economic redistribution, the journalist exceeded the limits that politicians could tolerate. Martyred by Robespierre, Hebert was rediscovered in the 1840s as a for­ gotten hero of the revolution and a fresh model for militant revolu­ tionary journalists frustrated by bourgeois culture and anxious for social rather than political change. But among all the pioneers of revolutionary journalism, Nicholas Bonneville was perhaps the most original. He was the first to issue the famous cry of La Marseillaise: \"Aux armes, citoyens!\" even before it was used to summon the mob to the Bastille.5 6 From May to July 1789, Bon­ neville's new journal Le Tribun du Peuple directed attention beyond the revolution then taking place to \"the revolution that is being prepared .\" 5 7 He looked for deliverance not to any political republic, but to \"the re­ public of letters\": 5 8 a rallying of intellectuals to lead mankind. Bonneville saw his new journal as a \"circle of light,\" whose writers were to transform the world by constituting themselves as \"simul­ taneously a centre of light and a body of resistance.\" 59 They were to be \"legislators of the universe,\" 6 0 preparing a \"vast plan of universal regenerati on, \" 61 and opposing \"those pusillanimous beings whom the indifferent crowd call moderate people.\" 62 The supreme authority was not to be any elected official, but a \"tribun e\": a modern version of the idealized tribal commander of the uncorrupted early Romans. The revo­ lution to come must be led by a \"tribune of the people,\" a reincarn ation of the special leaders first chosen by the plebeian legions in 494 B.C. to defend them against the Roman patricians. On the eve of the first anniversary of the seizure of the Bastille, Bon­ neville became the first to use the most basic weapon in the revolution­ ary seizure of speech. He substituted the familiar, plebeian form of address, tu, for the formal, aristocratic vous in addressing the king of France. 6 3 Though Bonneville was elected secreta ry of the assembly of repre­ sentatives of the Paris Commune that met in June 1790, it was basically through his new journal that he worked to exercise his \"tribunat dans la Republique des lettres.\" 6 4 In the seventeenth and last issue of his Tribun, he proclaimed his intention to provide the revolution with \"a"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"FouNDATIONs OF THE REVOLUTIONARY FAITH mouth of iron ... a kind of tribune that will always be open.\" 6 5 He pub­ lished a Bulletin de la Bouch e de Fer in the summer, 66 and in October put out the first issue of La Bouche de Fer, which he saw as a kind of public oracle: C'est la force magique Et sa Bouche de fer sauve la Republique. 1n The first issue called La Bouche \"a different, superior power,\" a \"fourth power\" 68 -a power outside and above the three branches of government that the American Revolution had taught European re­ formers to admire . This \"superior power\" had a right and obligation to conduct censorship and denunciation in defense of the revolution. Its mission was \"universal surveillance\" on behalf of that \"multitude of good citizens who are not yet enlightened enough to know what they desire.\" 69 Reporters for Bonneville's journal were \"tribunes of the people,\" coun­ tering the despotic tendencies not only of monarchs, but also of patrician assemblies. These tribunes were not just to represent their region, but were also to know and report \"the heart of their people.\" 70 All nations and languages were to send messages to Bonneville's let­ ter box, which was shaped like an iron mouth. This \"mouth\" was to swallow and digest the words it was fed and then to announce its coun­ sel to \"friends of truth\" everywhere. Just as \"mouths of gold\" spoke of war, so the \"mouth of iron\" announced the coming of universal peace.7 1 Indeed, its distribution on the streets was to be announced by trum­ peters.7 2 Although Bonneville's journal ceased publication on July 28, 1791, the echoes of its trumpets did not die out. In the early years of the revolution, Bonneville and other literary jour­ nalists in effect invented a new, post-aristocratic form of French that was rich in neologisms and hailed as la langue universe lle de la Republique .1a This language was forced on the dialec t-rich provinces as a means of destroying local loyalties in a time of national danger. After 1792 the documents of the central government were no longer even translated into provincial dialects; in some ways a \"body of lan­ guage\" replaced the body of the king as the symbol of French unity.74 This new language was derived from the living speech of the revolu­ tion itself. Revolutionary French destroyed many oral traditions of the provinces and countryside in the course of radiating its own song and speech out from Paris. In the hands of Bonneville's associates, men like Anacharsis Cloots, the \"orator of the human race,\" the spoken language tended to recapture its primitive function of communal incantation. Bonneville's closest friend, Claude Fauchet, was a curate who helped storm the Bastille and then stormed the pulpit with a new genre of revo­ lutionary sermon. In the very citadel of Catholic France, Notre Dame Cathedral, Fauchet used words that anticipated Lincoln to call for a new kind of governm ent: pour le peuple, par le peuple, au peuple .7fi"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"A Locus of Legitimacy 37 Many revolutionary leaders had been trained in rhetoric by the Jesuits and in oratory as prosecuting lawyers or preaching curates. Philosophers in the prerevolutionary period had increasingly sought \"less to prove than to move, less to demonstrate than to touch.\"7 6 As a young advo­ cate, Robespierre had dreamed of stimulating ... within hearts this sweet shudder by which sensitive souls respond to the voice of the defender of humanity.77 \"Vous fremissez, messieurs !\" Danton said to the National Assembly as it prepared to found the first French Republic in 1792. This \"voluptuous shudder\" seemed to be a \"symbol of the contagion of the word.\" 78 It re­ flected as well the decisive transformation made by Danton himself (\"the Mira beau of the populace\") in revolutionary rhetoric: the discarding of classical metaphors and aristocratic forms for earthy speech directed at the masses.79 Oratory in this new idiom fed the fever of 1792-94 and dominated the new civic rituals. Revolutionary journalists often seemed to echo, if not actually to re­ produce, the spoken word. Spontaneous speech was thought to approx­ imate the language of nature itself. There was a revulsion that was al­ most physical against any writing not directly inspired by revolutionary ideas. Saint-Just denounced \"the demon of writing,\" which led to the \"tyranny of bureaus .\" H o Cloots warned against \"men of letters who were not men of ideas.\" s1 Bonneville cried out almost audibly against \"the mania of decrees\": Point de decretomanie ou nous perdons les moeurs et la liberte ! 8 2 Bonneville insisted that the authority of revolutionary intellectuals should supplant once and for all that of authoritarian politicians. He had been one of the first to revile Necker before the revolution; to de ­ nounce Lafayette as a potential \"Caesar,\" and to warn against Jacobin ambitions with the slogan point de societe dominatric e.83 The appearance of revolution ary intellectuals in the modem world is inseparable from their reverence for le peuple-Dieu. For Bonnev ille the only antidote to the aristocrat ic indulgence of \"talking societies\" was immersion in the language of \"the people.\" Bonneville had in mind, of course, not the words actually spoken by ordinary people but what he thought of as the hidden language of their true desires, the expression of the goodness they preserve when living naturally as \"brothers and friends.\" 84 Well before the revoluti on, Bonnev ille had urged the aristo­ cratic Condorcet to speak more simply. If writers do not inspire the people, who \"always have a rapturous feeling for nature,\" the fault lies with the aristocratic philosophe's own loss of touch with the \"language of fire,\" the \"universal language : sighs and tears.\" s u In his proto-romantic search for pure origins and radical simplicity, Bonnev ille suggested that both speech and worship began when man first placed fire in water and heard the whistling sound is-is. He con­ tended that the Cathedral of Notre Dame had been superimposed on an earlier, more universal cult of Notre-Isis. s6"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"F ouNDATIONS oF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH The legitimizing myths of the revolution became inextricably con­ nected with key words drawn from the language of \"sighs and tears\" and used for incantation more than explanation. The rational discourse of the philosophes was engulfed by a torrent of terminology created by intellectuals for plebeia ns, repeated in staccato shouts, and italicized or capitalized on fly-sheets and wall posters. Literate reformers of an earlier generation bitterly denounced the new \"disposition to dominate conversation\" with idees forces, to profit from \"the power of badly de­ fined words,\" and to camouflage denunciations by using \"on dit que ... \" rather than \"a precise and human nominative.\" 8 7 But they recognized that the new journalists had found the secret of arousing the masses: The people, burdened with their daily work, ha ve neither the ability, time, nor desire to read. This enormous mass of people could never ha ve been led into the terrible movement of these past three years by meta physi­ cal, philosophical, or eloquent works. Other levels were needed. . . . not books, but words : liberty, tyranny, despotism . .. . ss In revolutionary Paris at the height of the terror in 1794, words had become weapons. Robespierre silenced Hebert in March, and justified further censorship by a special study of language in May, which de­ scribed words as \"the bonds of society and guardians of all our knowle dge.\" 8 9 From the still undisci plined Palais-Royal, however, came a call for the direct translation of words into deeds, in a pamphlet appropriately en­ titled L'Explosion by Jean-Franc;:ois Varlet, a protege of Hebert and Bon­ neville, warning that \"despotism has passed from kings to committees .\" j)() If words ruled the world, ultimate power could be thought to inhere in the compilation of the ultimate dictionary. Efforts to do so were in fact made by two literary friends of Bonneville, and of each other, Restif de la Bretonne and Louis-Sebas tien Mercier. Each of them wrote de­ tailed descriptions both of ordinary Parisian life and of the Palais-Royal at the beginning of the upheaval.91 The \"universal\" language each sought to create was the language of aspiration in the city both loved, and of imagination in the section they knew best. Restif attempted to compile a Gloss ographe for a new universal lan­ guage that would free French from being merely \"a dialect of Latin.\" 9 2 Mercier devoted most of his energies in the revolution ary era to a mag­ num opus that appeared only in 1801 : Neology or Vocabulary of Words That Are New or to Be Renewed. Mercier compared his own accom­ plishment to Bonaparte 's conquest of territory for the republic, describ­ ing himself as le premier livrier de la Fran ce-a position apparently comparable in the republic of letters to Napoleon's first consulship in the republic of politics.93 After falling out with Napoleon, Mercier continued to work on his partially suppressed and never completed Universal Dic­ tionary of Language.94 Like Restif and Bonneville , Mercier died forgotten and has continued to be largely neglected by historians of the revoluti on.

His remarkable utopian work of 1768- 81, The Year 2440, predicted the destruction of the Ba stille 95 and a future republican form of govern­ ment for France. The republic was to be based not on institutional mechanisms, but on a democratized language that would have \"rein­ stated equal dignity for words as well as men. No single word will be vile,\" 9 6 and people throughout the world will be nourished by words from journals \"twice as long as English gazettes.\" 97 When the revolu­ tion ary confl agration finally came, Mercier traced its origins to Rous­ seau,9s and saw it spreading through words that \"crackled\" in contem­ porary usage. The introduction to the German edition of his Year 2440 found his picture \"full of fire,\" 99 and Mercier used the same metaphor four years later to suggest prophetically the link between ideas and revoluti on : . . . the flame of philosophy . . . has been lit and dominates Europe : the wind of despotism in curbing the flame can only stir it up and billow it into larger and brighter bursts. 1 0o The ultimate keeper of this flame was the most secret inner group within the Pa lais-Royal : Bon neville's \"Social Circle .\" This organization combined the Masonic ideal of a purified inner circle with the Rous­ seauian ideal of a social, and not merely a politic al, contract. There may have been some continuity with a prerevolution ary Club of the Social Contract or Social Club under Philip of Orleans, to which Bonneville had belonged. l 0 1 He appears first to have conceived of this new organi­ zation in October or November of 1789, and first to have formed it in the summer of 1790 out of the Thursday editorial meetings of his Tribune of the People - initially as an organ of surveillance and censor­ ship for La Bouche de Fer . 1 o 2 Bonnev ille distinguished his new organization from all other revolu­ tion ary clubs. \"The Socia l Circle, which seeks neither masters nor disci­ ples, is not at all a club,\" he insisted in the first issue of La Bouche. 1 °3 Members had secret cards and assumed names. They comprised an in­ ner group within a broader \"patriotic circle of the friends of truth,\" 10 4 and La Bouche was their \"hierophantic\" interpreter of truth to those outside. Bonneville sought to organize in the Cirque of the Palais-Royal a \"Universal Confederation of the Friends of Truth,\" and attracted some six thousand members to its opening session in October 1790. 10 5 Bonne­ ville appe ars to have viewed it as a kind of rival ideological parliament to the Na tional Assembly, organized by \"old friends united in principle and in heart long before the birth of the Na tional Assembly.\" 106 The constitution of the confederation, published in November 1790, described it as the servant of the Social Circle \"and of all the circles of free brothers (francs-f reres ) affiliated with it.\" 1 01 \"Circles of free broth ers\" may have existed in Utrecht, Geneva, Genoa, and Phil adelphia -a ll had correspondence centers for the Social Circle. 10 S Another main outlet appea rs to have been London, where Bon neville had lived and written just prior to the revolution and where a printing press and for-"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"F ouNDATIONS OF THE R EvoLU TIONARY F AITH mal branch of the Social Circle were founded under \"one of our English franc-brothers\" -John Oswald. 1 0 9 Oswald was an uprooted Scottish soldier-of-fortune who had fought in both America and India, worked as a jeweler and veterinarian , and become proficient in an astonishing range of languages including Arabic , Greek, and Portuguese. 110 One of the first foreigners to hail the french Revolution , Oswald became, in effect, Bonneville's London correspon­ dent. He translated from and contributed to Bonneville's publications, and transmitted them to \"franc-Scottish\" and \"franc-Irish\" as well as to \"Anglo-franc\" brothers . Bonneville's English friends denounced the English constitution, long admired by French reformers , as a parliamentary despotism. It repre­ sents poor people in the way \"wolves represent sheep.\" 11 1 Oswald personally joined the military struggle of the French Republic against the British-led coalition. In Paris in 1793, just before going off along with his two sons to die in battle in the Vendee, he published The Gov­ ernment of the People; or a Sketch of a Constitution for the Unive rsal Common- wealth. By fohn Oswald Anglo -franc, Comma ndant of the First Battalion of Pikes, in service of the Republic of France. l 1 2 \"A Constitu­ tion for the Universal Common-wea lth\" was the only one worthy of the \"Universal Confederation of the Friends of Truth.\" In his major work for the Universal Confederation of the Friends of Truth, Bonneville saw social justice radiating out from \"the center of the social circle,\" and truth generating the \"electricity\" of virtuous con­ duct. 11 3 He provides one of the first rationalizations for the rule of an intellectual elite: \"In intellectual organizati on, truth is the center to which all should gravitate.\" 1 14 The very dedication to Truth, however , may require the tactical concealment of some truths ... not out of gratuitous cruelty, but in order to secure little by little, uni­ versally, the innumerable steps that must be taken on our ladder. l l5 \"All the parties\" should respect La Bouche de Fe r , since it \"serves none of them,\" 116 but only Truth. Bonneville's Friends of Truth envisaged the univers al rule of \"the re­ public of letters,\" not the parochial control of any political republic. Au­ thority was to come not from below by assembling the etats generaux, but from above by the confe deration des ecrivains generaux , 11 1 Bonneville's group was a self-con scious, self-proclaimed intellectual elite. They were les intelligences superieures capable of finding une lumiere vive ... dans les spheres tres-elevees de la mw;; onnerie. ll s The hope of humanity lay, therefore , in purifying the intellectual elite, not in imposing any checks upon its power. The main reason for fear was external: the persistence of irrational violence par les imaginations mal reglees. l 1 9 Bonneville's concept of rule by \"superior intelligences\" represents the first revolution ary equation of abstract intelligence with concrete people claiming political authority. Thus, Bonneville launched the idea of an inner intellectual \"circle\" as the controlling unit of a secret interna-"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"A Locus of Legitimacy tional movement. He seems even to have anticipated the future east­ ward migration of this idea through the German Kreis and the Polish kola to the Russian kruzhok, when he wrote even before the revoluti on: In France, in Italy, in Germany, and above all in Russia, they are cher­ ishing the hope of one day being admitted into the miraculous secrets by the beneficent superiors who watch over all the members of the soc i ety . 1 2 o Bonneville anticipated both the idea of an elite intelligentsia and the special receptivity of Russians to this concept. It seems appropriate that the key founder (Count Dmitriev-Mam onov) of the pioneering group (the Order of Russian Knights) within the first Russian revolu­ tionary movement (the Decembrists of the 182os) had not only read Bonneville , but insisted : For the basic design of a plan I know of no more suitable book than La bouche de fer de Bonneville. 12 1 In a chapter of his work for the Friends of Truth entitled \"On the Theory of Insurrections,\" Bonneville described how \"a beloved magis­ trate\" would appear before his people in the new order to conduct a naturalistic version of Holy Communion : Friends, this is the body of the sun which ripens the harvest. This is the body OF THE BREAD which the rich owe to the poor! 122 He addressed his readers not as Freemasons ( franc- ma<;ons ) but as Francs-cosmopoli tes-an altogether new breed combining the natural order of the early Franks and the \"universal fraternity\" of the modern Enlightenment. After a Hymn to Truth invoking the need \"to conquer the light,\" 12 3 Bonneville intoned: CERCLE du PEUPLE FRANC, pour forth with a sure hand thy luminous rays into the dark climate s.1 2 4 A remarkable appendix spoke of \"magic circles\" and reduced major political systems to graphic circular representations of how the parts relate to the center of power. The impression created by his cercles con­ stitutionels was that both the original constitution of England under Alfred and the cons titution of revolution ary France represented simple, symmetrical systems compared with the constitution of England during or since the Puritan Revolution. 12 5 Yet even the purest of political cir­ cles seemed implicitly inferior to the social circle, which would realize \"the perfectibility of all governments\" 12 6 by creating an egalitarian so­ ciety: the perfect circle in which all points are equidistant from the center, Truth. The Universal Confederation of the Friends of Truth represented one of the first efforts of a small circle of intellectuals system atically to propagate radical social ideas to a mass audience. The Confederation advocated a grande communion sociale that would provide social bene­ fits, univers al, progressive taxation, and the extension of civic equality to women and blacks."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"F ouNDATIONS oF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH \"Of the Paris political clubs the Cercle Social was the first to advocate feminism.\" 1 27 It called for circles of women to accompany those of \"free brothers ,\" 1 2 8 and formed on February IS, I79I, in the Cirque of the Pal ais-Royal a feminine Society of the Friends of Truth with the Dutch Etta Palm (nee D'Aelders ) as president. 1 2 9 The Social Circle was also relatively sympathetic to the cause of the blacks. Among the many engravings and medallions that Bonneville's artistic brother Fran<;ois designed for the Social Circle, two of the best depicted in classical style a black man and a black woman bearing respectively the legends : I am thy equal. Color is nothing, the heart is all, is it not, my brother? In freedom as thou art : The French Republic in accord with nature has willed it : am I not thy sister? 1 3 0 From the beginning Bonneville's stress on social equality rather than political discipline and the determination to be \"universal\" and hos­ pitable to foreigners rendered his organization suspect to the Jacobins. They accused Bonneville of building an explosive \"new volcano\" in the underground cafes whose crater was \"the mouth of hell.\" (La bouche d'enfer was a play on words with the title of Bonneville's journa l.) 1 3 1 In February I79I, Bonneville answered the Jacobin accusation that his program was \"incendi ary\" by agreeing that he was in truth attempting to generate \"the warmth of universal fraternity.\" 1 3 2 His combustible material was often foreign. Thomas Paine moved in I79I from his Lon­ don associat ion with Mirabeau's former secreta ry to take up residence with Bonneville and his wife and to become their closest friend. Fresh from completing his famous defense of the French Revolution, The Rights of Man, Paine together with another American in Paris, Joel Barlow, helped impart a sense of apostolic linkage between republican Americ a and revolutionary France. 1 33 Bonneville argued against Marat's call for a revolution ary dictatorship after the king tried to flee abroad in I 79 I : No more king! No dictator ! Assemble the people and face the sun. Pro­ claim that the law alone will be sover eign .134 Their belief in a totally legal order led Bonneville and Paine to oppose the two key political decisions of the First French Republic : the exe­ cution of the king and the establishment of Robespierre's dictatorship . The Jacobins rejected Paine's argument that revolutionaries should rise above the death penalty, and Marat denounced Bonneville as a \"base flatterer\" in the pay of Lafayet te.J35 The murder of Marat intensified the fear of foreign subversi on-and the suspicion that the cosmopolitan Palais-Royal was its breeding ground. Bonneville's principal collaborators on C hronique du M ois (the journal he founded after the Bouche de Fer)-Brissot and Condorcet -were killed, and Paine and Bonneville's other foreign friends were imprisoned.

In fact the press had always been the heart and soul of the Social Circle. So long as it continued to op­ erate, the concept of an international, egalitarian transformation of society continued to grow and deepen. While on a revolutionary mis­ sion for the new republic in September 1792, Bonneville sent back an independent report addressed to \"Free Citizen s, directors of the press of the Social Circle, Paris.\" l3S Thereafter Varlet, the leading opponent on the left to Robespierre's dict atorship , wrote pamphlets for the press of the Social Circle. As president of the Central Revolutionary Com­ mittee of the Paris sections, he preached \"permanent insurrection\" as the logical means of supporting \"direct\" democr acy.139 Varlet later joined Babeuf's proto-Communist Conspiracy of Equals, and continue d-along with Sylvain Marechal, author of the conspiracy's Manifesto-to publish with Bonneville's press. The novel of Restif that first introduced the word communist to a general audience and many of the plays of Bonneville's friend Mercier also appeared under Bonne­ ville's imprim atur. Even Babeuf, who was connected at an early date with Bonneville's confederation, built his conspiracy of 1796 around an oracular journal that used the original title Bonneville had intro­ duced six years earlier: The Tribune of the People. But the republic was at war in 1792, and so it was inevitable that the locus of legitimacy was to shift away from the Palais-Royal. A nation at arms in the name of \"the people\" could no longer tolerate elite prophets of cosmopolitan confederations and universal Truth . Para-milita ry \"defenders of the republic\" began system atic forays early in 1793 into the Palais-Royal to apprehend alleged foreign and aristo­ cratic sympat hizers . By midyear France was in the middle of a civil as well as a foreign war. Paris was suffering a shortage of bread and fuel on the one hand and an excess of inflammatory patriotic journals on the other. The center of power had moved from the Girondist assembly to the J acobin dictatorship. The locus of legitimacy was moving from closed to open space, from the editorial office to the public festival, from the Cafe de Venus to the Champs de Mars, the great military parade ground of Paris on the left bank of the Seine."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"44 F ouNDATIONs OF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH The Fields of Festival There was almost certainly no serious conspiracy within the Palais­ Royal. Philip of Orleans was too weak to constitute a political threat, and no cafe-based organiz ation had the structure of support to rival either the national network of Jacobin clubs or the sectional governments within Paris. Yet what Nicholas Bonneville created within the permissive ambiance of the Palais-Royal was nothing less than the prototype of a modern revolutionary organization. It had global political pretensions (\"a uni­ versal confederati on\") based on ideological convictions (\"friends of truth\") under the discipline of a secret inner group (the Social Circle) who pretended to translate Rousse au's general will into revolutionary strategy through an oracular journal (\"the mouth of iron\"). Physically, Bonneville's organization may be thought of as a series of concentric circl es. The outer circumference was the high colonnaded quadrangle of the Palais-R oyal; the second circle, the enclosed Cirque where the Universal Confederation of the Friends of Truth met in 1790- 91; and the inner circle was where Bonneville's own group met in a cafe even further underground than the subterranean Cirque. Bonneville sought legitimacy, not power, and he is thus overlooked by modern historians for whom struggle among political factions is somehow more real than the contention of political symbols. Yet the quest for legitimacy is no less important to trace than is the politics of power if we are to penetrate the minds of revolutionaries and not merely describe the externals of the revolutionary process. Bonneville made the most thorough effort to replace the circle of the court at Versailles with a new circle of authority in Paris. But \"the people\" still needed something to rally around, a common point of reference if not of reverence, new rituals to replace the rituals of Versailles and Notre Dame. The search for authority in a landscape newly stripped of familiar landmarks led many to look beyond language for direct certainty. Dis­ oriented men and women unconsciously discarded the familiar \"refer­ ence\" symbols used in conventional communication and reached out for \"condens ation\" symbols that might directly represent truth itsel£. 140 If the inner circle was a condensed symbol of perfection and equality (opposing the linear, hierarchical symbols of the old regime ), the circle required a center: some common point of reference to unify and equal­ ize all the points on the circumfer ence. The unifying point of authority within Bonneville's circle was the press. It was the totem within the Social Circle, the larynx behind the mouth of iron. The press became and has remained the core of revolu­ tionary counter- authority to modern political tyranny. The smell of printer's ink is the incense of modern revolutiona ry organization. But for all its import ance, the printing press could not provide the unifying authority for society, or even a condens ation symbol for the"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"A Locus of Legitimacy 45 revolutionary faith. In the first place, the printing press was a complex machine rather than a simple expression of nature. Revolutionary au­ thority juxtaposed the simple and natural to the complex and tradi­ tional. If the circle was the microcosm of a purified nature , any central symbol within it would have to be a distillation of Nature. In the second place, the function of the printing press was to produce written ref­ erence symbols, not direct condensations or representations of things. Revolutionary Paris was not prepared to follow any linear parade of words or train of thought. Such products of aristocratic complication would lead to dispute and division rather than to unity of feeling and purpose. Insofar as words played a unifying role in the early years of the revolution, it was through the slogans of orators like Mirabeau and Danton rather than through the structure of argumen ts. A painting of the murdered Marat and an etched image of Pere Duchene were better known than was any article of Marat or Hebert. Slogans and images changed with the passions that inspired them; they were fleeting points of reference for a fickle populace. But there were also solid symbols that commanded broad allegiance ; they provided rallying points for popular rituals of unity during the early years of the French Revolution. First, of course, was the Bastille itself. This architectural embodiment of unyielding authority provided a condensat ion symbol for the old regime and in late June and early July, a target for the hitherto diffuse unrest of Paris. France first found its rev­ olutionary identity not only by storming the Bastille but also by razing it utterly, creating in the heart of Paris a field of nature where the towers of tradition once stood. From the stones of the leveled fortress eighty­ three small models of the Bastille were built and sent to every department of France \"to perpetuate there the horror of despotism.\" 1 41 The site of the Bastille itself became a cleared space: a tabula rasa. Many proposals were made to fill it with symbols of a new order, but the first to be realized was the enormous , sphynx-like statue of Nature erected there for the Feast of Unity and Indivisibility in 1793 on the first anniversa ry of the overthrow of the monarchy. Designed by the brother-in-law of David, the statue was to be the rallying point for a predawn gathering to sing a \"Hymn to Nature\" by Gossec, to hear the poet Herault de Sechelles read an invocat ion to nature, and then to join in a ritual that was nothing less than a secular fusion of baptism and communion rites beneath a \"fountain of regeneration representing Nature\": From her fertile breasts (w hich she will press with her hands ) will spurt an abundance of pure and healthful water. From it shall drink, each in his turn, the eighty-six commissioners sent from the primary assemblies ... a single cup shall serve for all. 142 The equivalent of the consecration of the host came from the act of the president of the Conven tion in filling the first cup and pouring it on the ground as he walked in a circle around the statue of Nature, \"watering the soil of liberty\" and tracing the circle within which be­ lievers must come to share the common cup.143"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"F OUNDATIONS OF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH Dame Nature was a rival authority not just to the king, but to the church. On the eve of the first anniversary of the seizure of the Bastille the Cathedral of Notre Dame celebrated not a Christian mass, but a mu­ sical \"hierodrame\" of the revolution called La Prise de la Bastille .1H By the time of the Feast of Unity and Indivisibility three years later, the high altar in Notre Dame had been replaced by a \"mountain\" of earth from which an actress dressed in white intoned Gossec's \"Hymn to Liberty\" like a Druid priestess. She invoked a kind of secular counter­ trinity: Mother (nature), Daughter (liberty), and Holy Spirit (popular sovereig nty) : Descend, o Liberty, daughter of Nature. 1 45 From its negative focus on sending miniature Bastilles to every de­ partment of France, the revolutionary imagination soon progressed to positive symbols like planting a tree of liberty. A tree had the incal­ culable advantage of being an organic product of nature : a symbol of regeneration rooted in the earth but reaching up to heaven. Popular festivals soon took place in local communities around the ritual of planting such a tree. There was a natural equality in the circle of those who gathered for this open-air, communal event, and there was continuity with the apolitical tradition of planting and decorating a maypole. But the tree of liberty was a living totem: an acceptable new form of verticality amidst the leveling impulses of the revolut ionary era. The tree was preferably a young oak, which symbolized strength and youth and did not cast shadows. Communal activities were to be con­ ducted openly in the sunshine nearby in defiance of secretive tyrants, who, in the words of one orator, never felt ... obligated to expose all their acts of governing to the light of day. They abandoned the trees for the interior of their houses where they forged the chains that subjugated posterity. 1 4 6 Trees of liberty were often fertilized with the ashes of patriots killed in battle, and were used to replace crosses in public places; they were venerated for their mute pedagogy as \"silent teachers of the com­ munity.\" 1 47 In the feast commemorating the execution of King Louis XVI, the planting of a tree of liberty was the central, obligat ory rituaJ.l4 R The tree of liberty was now said to be fertilized by the blood of kings-blood that came from the third and most famous focus of revolutionary ritual: the guillotine. The guillotine was first employed in Paris on April 25, 1792, to execute an assassin who had been ap­ prehended three months earlier in the Palais-Royal. Viewed from the open air around liberty trees, the subterranean recesses of the Palais seemed particularly suspect. Already in 1790, the police had referred to \"this shadowy cloaca,\" and the extraordinary device that was un­ veiled to avenge the murder there was a mechanical device for decap­ itation championed by an \"enlightened\" member of the National As­ sembly, Dr. Guillotin, in order to democratize and humanize capital punishment. The execution did not take place until the new machine"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"A Locus of Legitimacy 47 had been tested on both animals and human corpses; and it occurred publicly with electric effect-i nspiring both revulsion and fascination. If the rituals around trees of liberty were essentially dances, those around the guillotine were dramas of the highest order. The guillotine was a hypnotic attraction in the great squares of Paris; it became the leading actor in these open-air theaters. Mter its debut in the Place des Greves, the guillotine moved in August 1792 into the Place du Carousel, directly in front of the royal palace. In April 1793, it was left out on permanent public display, and transferred in May to the most prominent public place in Paris, the Place Louis XV, where it remained until the end of the Reign of Terror. Each gesture of each prominent figure on the way to the scaffold was invested with mean­ ing, and legends were spun out of the alleged final words of many who perished on this sacrificial altar. The guillotine turned the revolution into a drama that all could under­ stand. It was the Enlightenment on display, punishing all equally with­ out causing unnecess ary sufferin g. La sainte guillotine was the awe­ some heroine of a morality play; the ending was known, but there was the perpetual possibility of minor variation in individual performances. This mass for the masses offered the certainty of blood sacrifice and the promise of collective redempti on. By the end of the Terror, children were being given toy guillotines and sparrows for practice executions. 1 49 This collective ritual in the public places of Paris made anything tak­ ing place on an indoor stage seem pale by comparison. The event was free and (to cite the slogan that the theaters had adopted from the Bon­ neville-Fauchet circle) par et pour le peuple. Talma and his colleagues at the pro-revolutionary Theatre de la Republique in the Palais-Royal were frequent spectators at the greater drama taking place outdoors. Evreinov, the man who directed the greatest open-air revolutionary pag­ eant of the twentieth century-the recreation by the cit y of St. Peters­ burg of the Bolshevik seizure of power-has perhaps best charact erized the revolutionary play that unfolded in Paris: In eighteenth century France, the competition between life in actuality and life on the stage had reached the point where no one could say which was more theatrical. In both there were pompous, overstudied phrases, a mannered refinement of bows, smiles and gestur es; in both, showy cos­ tumes ... courtyards ... powder, rouge, beauty spots, monocles and very little of one's \"natural\" face ... . And then a reaction began .... The first to \"come to his senses\" on life's stage was Jean-Jacques Rousseau; the first on the theatrical stage was Talma. Both of them, lackeys in their youth, wanted to return the conceited lords of life back to natural ness. More than a political revolution was needed to expose \"the theatrical pomposity of the hierarchical system of its life.\" The first revolution changed only the mise-en-scene and changed the roles .... Ha ving established a purely the atrical equ ality, the first thing to be concerned with was costu me : the painter David sketched the costume of the \"free citizen,\" the actor Talma tried it on in the theat re, and the people approved it and adopted it.

Only those succeeded who had an artistic temperament and sense of timing. In­ corrigible actors, utterly unhappy to be without a director, the people soon discovered one in the person of Napoleon : an actor who dared to teach the great Talma himsel £.1 5 1 But the search for legitimacy involved more than the dance around the liberty tree and the drama of the guillotine . It involved a festive attempt to realize utopia, not in the enclosed Palais-Royal but in the open air: to transform old Paris into a new Jerusalem ; to move from the guillotine's kingdom of fear to a republic of rejoicing in which Dame Nature was Queen. One revolution ary proposing changes in Pari­ sian street names asked: Is it not natural that from the Place of the Revolution one should follow the Street of the Constitution to that of Happine ss? 1:;� The very geography of Paris was invested with moral meaning, and the only question for the believing revolutionary was where in Paris is that Place of Happiness and how does one get there. Revolutionary Paris declared, in practice, that happiness lay in an open field to be reached by festive procession. The destination for the first and the last of the great revolution ary festivals was the largest open space in central Paris, its ultimate amphitheater for the drama of revolu­ tionary redemption : the Champs de Mars. Some one hundred thousand Parisians dug up this large military re­ view ground and created a natural earthen arena for the Feast of Fed­ eration on July 14, 1790, the first Bastille Day. More than three hundred thousand Frenchmen from all over the country marched in procession through driving rain to hear a vast chorus commend the unified French nation to the Sun : \"pure fire, eternal eye, soul and source of all the wor ld.\" 153 The Champs de Mars became the \"metaphysical center of Paris\"; 154 and the revolution ary choreographers decided that henceforth National feasts can have no enclosure except the vault of the sky, be­ cause the sovereign, that is to say the people, can never be shut into a circumscribed place .1 5 fi The constitution was delivered to the people from that open sky to an open field by balloon on September 10, 1791. As the venerated dead were being moved from open Christian graveyards into closed pagan pantheo ns, living revolutionaries moved from Christian cathedrals into pagan parks� driven by a kind of cosmic claustrophobia. 1 56 A procession from the ruins of the Bastille was combined with the"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"A Locus of Legitimacy 4 9 popular assembly in the Champs de Mars on the second Bastille Day in 1791. By the time of the Feast of Indivisibility in August 1793, the procession was in fact organized into a kind of five-act drama of rev­ olutionary redemption. Stops along the way resembled stations of the cross. The predawn gathering watched the sun rise over the statue of Na ture at the Place de la Bastille. The group picked up strength as it surged through Paris, which was \"drowned in a sea of flowers .\" 1 57 The cortege flowed into the Tuileries (le Jardin National ), where the twenty­ four hundred delegates of the forty-eight sections of Paris were joined by the entire National Convention and fifty members of the Jacobin Club (la societe mere), who melded into the procession to the Champs de Mars. So many flowers, fruits, and even vegetables were carried that the festival has been called a \"vegetable metamorphosis of Paris.\" 1 5 8 A float at the center of the procession was drawn by eight bulls with gilded horns carrying a printing press and a plow-each under a tree of liberty. The Champs de Mars was newly planted with trees, and the spectators from previous festivals now became participants on the giant \"mountain\" raised up as an altar to Nature with one hundred thousand people on it singing antiphonal responses to cues from trum­ pets and cannon. Paralleling the development in festivals from assembly to procession was the shift in the locus of legitimacy from space to ti me: from nature to history. With the formal adoption of a new revolution ary calendar by the Convention in the fall of 1793, utopia became temporal. Nowhere became sometime-and time was just beginning a new march that would be \"novel, majestic and simple like equality.\" 1 59 Nature itself sanctified the founding of the new era on the day of the sun's autumnal equinox : September 22, 1792. At the very moment when \"equality was marked in the skies between days and nights\" and \"the sun passed from one hemisphere to another,\" authority on earth \"passed from monarchical to republican governm ent.\" 1 GO The new calendar reflected \"the rationality and simplicity of nature,\" and provided an \"eloquent nomenclature\" of neologisms suggesting \"a vague 'rural and agricultural' ideolog y.\" 1G1 The calendar was divided into the four seasons with new names of months designed to suggest the mood of each: mournful 6se endings for winter months (Pluviose, Ventose ), spring names in al suggesting new growth (Germinal, Florea! ). The week-based on the religious idea of seven days of creation-was elim­ inated altogether. Sundays and saints' days were replaced by feasts consecrating natural (largely agricultur al) objects : trees, fruits, domes­ tic animals. The latter, wrote one of the authors of the calendar, should be \"far more precious in the sight of Reason than beatified skeletons dragged from the catacombs of Rome.\" 1 6 2 He rejoiced that cultivation had replaced cult in France, invoking na­ t ure in both its senses-as higher law and as simple countryside-as the supreme authority of the new order. In announcing the need to com­ plete the \"physical\" revolution with a revolution in the moral order, Robespi erre had proclaimed \"the universal religion of Nature.\" 1 63 Var­ let labeled I 793 \"the first year of truth\" and addressed a new Declara-"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"s o F OUNDATIONS OF THE R EVOL UTIONARY F AITH tion of the Rights of Man \"in the social state\" to the \"people of na­ ture.\" 16 4 A new version of La Marseillaise began Voici le jour ou la Nat ure Reprend ses droits sur l'univers . . .. 165 The last great festival on the Champs de Mars (the Feast of the Su­ preme Being on June 8, I794) was the largest (five hundred thousand participan ts), the simplest, and the most profoundly pastoral. Animals of warfare were excluded, with only peaceful cows and doves permitted in the cortege. The couplet for sunrise urged participants to begin the day \"in the fields\" tete-a-tete avec une fleur; and the \"vegetable exuber­ ance\" under sunlit skies caused many to believe in a kind of greening over of the guillotine. 166 \"The instrument of death had disappeared un­ der the trappings and flowers .\" 1 67 The revolutionary calendar seemed to be heralding a new \"life of fetes. \" 168 But within a few weeks, Robes­ pierre himself had been guilloti ned, utopian expectation had receded, and the Champs de Mars had become once again a place for military drill. The only innovative festival to be held there in the later revolu­ tionary period was a national industrial exposition for workers in I798, the first exhibit of this kind in modern France. 16 9 The Champs de Mars had become a field for displaying iron, and the great iron totem, the Eiffel Tower, eventually rose to dominate the very fields on which the festivals of Nature had once unfolded. One speaker later looked back on the great festivals as representing \"in the navigation of life what islands are in the midst of the sea: places for ref reshment and rest.\" 1 7 0 It was a more powerful image than the former participant may have intended, for many of the most dedicated revolutionaries felt the need to retreat at some point in the turmoil to real or imagined islands. The first major festival after the fall of Robespierre was his apotheo­ sis on October I I, I 794, when a special island was created for his remains in a pond in the Tuilerie s. The service was a kind of rural repudiation of indoor entombment in the Pantheon, a tradition that pre­ vailed from the reburial of Voltaire in I79I to that of Marat as recently as September 2I, I794· Behind musicians in rustic dress, botanists fol­ lowed in Robespierre's cortege bearing the inscrip tion: \"The study of Nature consoled him for the injustice of men.\" 1 71 The event was a throwback to the past-an imitation of Rousse au's burial on an island within a lake at Ermenonvi lle-and, at the same time, a symbolic anticipation of things to come. Just as Rousseau had sought political \"relevance\" by writing a constitutional proposal for the island of Corsica, so later revolutionary pioneers tended to find either hope or solace in the miniaturized isolation of a \"natural\" island­ from the pioneering popularizer of communism in the I84os, Goodwyn Barmby, who successively sought out the islands of Sark, Man, and Wight for his first \"Communistery,\" to the leader of the rival tradition of revolutionary nationalism, Giuseppi Garibaldi, who repeatedly returned like Antaeus to renew his strength on the small island of Caprera."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"A Locus of Legitimacy Those who were to lead the Babeuf conspiracy under the Directorate all retreated for a time under Robespierre to islands of one kind or another. Buonarroti, one of the conspirat ors of whom we shall hear a good deal later, tried to put egalitarian ideals in practice first in Corsica and then on a small island off Sardinia. Babeuf retreated even within Paris to the relative tranquility of the lie de la Cite to define his agrarian ideal in the relative obscurity of the food administration . Restif re­ peatedly returned to the even quieter lie Saint-Louis, on which he wrote endearing graffiti and to which he addressed his own epitaph .17 2 More's original Utopia had been located on an island; 1 73 and the first modern communist utopia, Morelly's Code of Nature, arose out of his earlier utopian fantasy about \"floating islands\" and provided the inspiration for Buonarroti's own island experiment. 1 74 Morelly's radi­ cally utopian ideas about material equality and the redistribution of property helped draw Babeuf and Buonarroti together into the Conspir­ acy of Equals. They turned for ultimate ideological guidance to a pop­ ularizer of Morelly and a choreographer of revolutionary festivals : Sylvain Marechal. Marechal was impelled to revolutionary utopianism-which came to include extreme atheism and anarchism -both by Rousseau and by the German preromantic poets. He used the pastoral forms of the latter to write in I779 a long elegy, The Tomb of ].-]. Rousseau, returning regular ly to his island burial place and publishing a second edition at Ermenonville itself upon the outbreak of the revolution. Calling himself the Shepherd Sylvain , he drew a picture of pastoral perfection in The Golden Age in I 782 and already in I 785 used the term \"community of goods\" to describe his egalitarian ideaJ. 1 75 In the early years of the revolution he wrote Dame Nat ure at the Bar of the National Asse mbly and a Code of Nature of his own, 1 7 6 In I 793 he published at Bonneville's press a blueprint for a new golden age which called for reorganizing society into small \"familie s\" modeled on the communal peasant units of the Auvergne and Franche Comte. 1 77 Well before his Manifesto of Equals, Marechal warned that \"the revolu­ tion is not completed,\" and that there will be \"a new and more equal distribution of goods.\" 1 1 s Under the Directorate, Marechal retreated from the Champs de Mars to the private islands of his imagination. He and his friends returned to underground cafes-but no longer to the arcaded splendor of the Palais­ Royal, which had been largely transformed into fashionable restaurants for the jeunesse don!e (whence lobster thermidore and \"Tortoni\" ice cream). 1 71l The hard core of committed revolutionaries now met in the more plebeian cafes: the Cafe Manoury on the left bank and the Cafe des Bains-Chinois on Montmartre, where Marechal composed songs for his red-haired mistress: Tu nous creas pour etre egaux.

She was also a seductive sorcer­ ess offering the emotional gratification of both mother and mistress. Dame Nature was a Goddess with two faces : a Janus who looked back to the \"rationalism\" of the eighteenth century and forward to the \"ro­ manticism\" of the early nineteenth. The modern revolutionary, born at the juncture of these two eras, worshipped both images. He drew in­ tellectu ally on the belief that Na ture represents some higher order of perfection, and emotion ally on the belief that Na ture provides earthier forms of satisfaction. We shall tum to the former, philosophical con­ cept of Na ture when we examine the surprising sources of revolutionary ideas about organization . Here we must linger for a moment on the psycho-sexual element in the revolutionary understanding of nature. One must note in passing the importance of Laclos and De Sade in the ambiance of the Palais-Royal, the fact that many innovative revolution­ ary thinkers from Mirabeau to Marechal were major collectors and authors of literary pornography, and the not -untypical menage a trois of Bonne ville's wife with Bonneville and Paine (the former naming his second son after the latter and permitting his wife to move back to Amer ica permanently as Paine's companion ). Paine's closest American friend in Paris, Joel Ba rlow, imagined that there were \"natural\" sexual origins for festive revolutionary sym bols . He traced trees of liberty to the pha llic symbol of the Egyptian cult of Osiris -c arri ed thence to Greece and Rome, where \"Bacchus was known by the epithet Liber, so that the Phallus became the emblem of Libertas. \" 1 8 1 Ba rlow derived the \"Phrygian\" red cap of liberty from a Roman symbol for the head of the phallu s, 1 82 and he decried with solemnity the substitution of a ma ypole and the celebration of May I for the older and richer ph allic festival of the Liber Deus on the vernal equinox : Men ha ve forgot the original object of the institution, the phallus has lost its testicles, and has been for many centuries reduced to a simple pole. 18 3 Restif, who introduced the word \"communist,\" first burst on the Eu­ ropean literary scene with a vivid depiction of a foot fetish in his novel of 1769, Le Pied de Fanchette, ou l'orpheline frant;ais e; he proceeded to produce a virtual encyclopedia of sexual fact and fantasy climaxing in his defense of prostitutes, Le Pornographe, of 1779 and his endless accounts of Paris by night. 1 84 The very act of writing his communist work, Monsieur Nicol as, has been described as \"a shockin gly direct sublimation of Restif's erotic dri ves.\" 1 85 As Restif himself explai ned : Failing the physical satisfaction so ardently desired, my imagination gorged itself on ideas . .. _ 1 8 G But revolutionary communism was not the ma in dest ination of the awakened romantic imagination , which gorged itself rather on the rival"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"A Locus of Legitimacy 5 3 tradition of revolution ary nat ionalism, which swept through France in 1793 and overwhelmed all ideological competit ion .

There was a trend toward radical simpli fication, how­ ever, as they increasingly tended to substitute labels for arguments. In attempting to state simply the purpose of secular society under popular sovereignty, they found three basic answers. Each was expre ssed by one of the words of the most important slogan of the era : liberty , fraternit y, and equality. Each of these three ideals had ancient origin s, but each acquired a new mystical aura during this peri od. At the beginning of the revolu­ tion they had blended into a trinitarian unity. Bu t there were deep, inherent differences between the three concepts, and much of the sub­ sequent history of the revolutionary tradition involved recurring and widening conflict between these rival ideals. First came the political ideal of securing freedom through a consti­ tutional republic. This was the original revolutionary cause of liberty -defined in terms of constitutional rights and popular legislature s. Property no less than people was to be freed from traditional bondage to nonproductive author ity-an idea that made the republican ideal attractive to entrepreneurs of all sorts. Second came the emot ional ideal of experiencing brotherhood in a new kind of nation. This was the romantic vision of fraternity : the discovery amidst a struggle against others that one's immediate neigh­ bors are one's brothers-linguistically, culturally, geographically-fel­ low sons of a common fatherland. Finally came the intellectual ideal of creating a nonhierarchical socio­ economic community . This was the rationalistic concept of equality : the collective sharing of goods within a community free of all social and economic distinctio ns. In general terms, the first ideal may be identified with the Enlighten-"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Object s of Belief 55 ment reformism of the eighteenth century ; the second with the roman­ tic nationalism of the nineteenth ; the third with the authorit arian com­ munism of the twentieth. The post -1789 his tory of the revolutionary tradition was to show the gradual, near-universal spread of the first ideal- followed by growing conflict between the other two. Though po­ litical \"liberation\" spread from France in the eighteenth century throug h Europe in the nineteenth to the wide world in the twentieth, the split between the rival ideals of national and social revolution grew and deepened. In consi dering these ideals, the n, we shall concentrate attention not so much on the first ideal, which arose in the relatively familiar debates culminating in the creation of the First French Republic in 1792. We shall focus more on the less understood rival ideals of na tional and socia l revolution which aro se to serve the more elusive goals of brother­ hood and equality. Fraternal nation alism dominated the period of war and terror from 1792 through 1794 ; ega litarian communism appeared during the subsequent period of seeming stagn ation under the Directory. Libert y : The Republican Ideal The replacement of a mona rchy by a republic was the major accom­ plishment of the initial period of the revolution. In the course of 1793, the republican ideal was sea led in blood by the execution of the king, in ink by the drafting of a radical constitution, and in time by the adoption of a revolutionary calendar. La rtipublique represented the Enlightenment ideal of a rational po­ litical order; it replaced old privileged distinctions with the single cate­ gory of \"citizen,\" the rule of kings with the rule of law : royaume by loyau me.1 Hum anity was thereby freed from the arbitrary authority of the past in favor of rational perfectibility in the future- through laws est ablished by popular assemb lies and through virtue inculcated in secular schools. \"Republican\" and \"republicanism\" had been transformed from terms of opprobrium to labels of pride by the American Revoluti on-pa rtic­ ularly during the six months of intense debate prior to the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. 2 Thomas Paine's Common Sense, published in January 1776, played a decisive role through its secular, millenarian insistence that \"we have it in our power to begin the world over aga in\" by establ ishing a new cons titutional union.3 Yet \"republican\" was not a major rallying cry in America during the debates leading up to the Const itution of 1787, and the American ex­ perience with republican rule did not prove very appealing to Euro-"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"F OUNDATIONS OF THE R EVOLU TIONARY F AITH peans in the 178os.4 In the debates over the first revolutionary con­ stitution for France during the summer of 1789, the Abbe Sieyes's call for direct popula r rule by a single legislative chamber prevailed over the rival idea of an American-style balanced gover nment with a bi­ cameral legisl ature and an executive (that is, a royal ) veto.5 The movement toward republican government in France and the dis­ cussi on of its proper const itution did, however, generate genuine excite­ ment-not least in Paine's own defense of the French Revolu tion against Burke in 1791 : What were formerly called revolutions were little more than a change of persons or an alteration of local circ umstances ... what we now see in the world . . . is a renovation of the natural order of things, a system of principles as universal as truth .. . . 6 When the First Republic was formally established, Paine moved to Paris, accepted French citizenship, founded the first \"republican\" society in Paris, edited a short-lived journal, The Republican, and attracted the ire even of Jacobins by his quasi -devotional use of the word \"republi can.\" 7 Paine was only one of many foreigners to find a new ident ity as a citizen of the revolution ary republic ; Ba beuf only one of many French­ men to refer to \"republican\" as \"this sublime word .\" s The continuing de bate about a constitution (even after the adoption of one in I 79 I ) lent an added aura to that word as well. In the first issue of a new revolutionary journal in I792, Bonnev ille insisted that . . . this health-giving word, this sacred word CON STITUTI ON ! must exercise a prodigious influence on the destinies of the human race.9 Fasc ination grew in late I792 and early I793 as the Convention pre­ pared the more radical republican Const itution of I793· Thoug h never put into effect, its text was carried like a holy object from the Bas tille to the Champs de Mars in the great feast of August IO, I793; 10 it re­ ma ined a venerated model for many political revolutionaries well into the nineteenth centur y.n One of the few demonstrable results of the two greatest upheavals within France in that century-the Revolution of I848 and the Paris Commune of I87I-was the reesta blishment of constitutional, republi­ can govern ments : the Second and Third Republics respectively. The major (though more short-live d) expression abroad of the revolutionary French ideal was the founding of satellite republic s: Ba tavian, Cisalpine, Helvetian, and so forth. As we shall see , the Europeanwide revolu­ tion ary tradition began as a series of repub lican, constitutional con­ spiracies against an imperial Na poleon and the mon archical restor ation that followed him . But, in I793 revolution ary France was ready to reject many repub­ licans including Paine and other foreigners gathered in Paris around journals like Le Cosmopolite and talking ecumenically about \"the great human republ ic.\" 12 By then, Frenchmen were inventing modern na­ tional ism- and the worship of its exclusive and elusive ideal, la grande nation."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The Objects of Belief 5 7 Fraternity : The Rise of Nationalism The second new ideal to emerge in the French Revolution was that of la nation : a new fraternity in which lesser loyalties as well as petty enmities were swept aside by the exultation of being born again as enfants de la patrie : children of a common fatherla nd. The nat ion was a militant ideal that was largely discovered on the jour de gloire of battle and best expressed in the levee en masse of 1793 : the prototype of modern mass consc ription on a \"nation al\" scale . The American Revolution had origin ated the concept of independence as a political rather than a philosophical ideal-creating in effect a new nation through a revolution. But the United States did not call itself a \"nation\" in the Declaration of Independence , or constitute itself as a nation in the modern sense. There was no new language to be asserte d, no mythologized antiquity to be created, no continuing foreign threat bordering on the new territorial entity. The official designat ion \"United States\" was the only formal name of a major country prior to the creat ion of the Soviet Union that contained no ethnic or na tional designation. In Americ a, a \"sense of nat ionhood was the child, not the parent of the Revolution .\" 1 3 In the French Revolution , on the contrary, the concept of a \"nation\" was central even though no new country was created. The word nation soon predomin ated over the older and more paternalistic term patrie.l4 Flags, feasts, and songs were all said to be \"national,\" and Bonneville, while organizing the Paris militia in the summer of 1789, warned against ennemis de la nation .15 Citizens of the old regime were forced to communicate in the French language, which until then had not been the basic tongue of many living under the French crown . The word nation had been used in Roman times to describe a na tive community smaller than a people but larger than a family-and in the late Middle Ages to des cribe regional student groups within universities and differing groups within church councils. Prerevolutionary France used the term for a representative group of aristocrats. In choosing the name assemblee nationale (instead of representants du peuple fran<;ais), the revolutionary Third Estate sought to give itself, in effect, aristo­ cratic status. 1 s The term nation was not widely understood at first. Peasa nts forced a well-dressed man to cry \"Vive la nation !\" early in the revoluti on, then begged him : \"Explain to us just what is the Nation.\" 1 7 But the label was soon understood to define a new type of popular sovereignty that was territorially and linguistically unified and often more absolute than monarchical authority. God Himself was reborn in early revolu­ tionary tracts as the \"Savior of the Nations,\" 1 8 \"the august and sublime na tional Areopagus\"; 19 and prayers were addressed to \"the body of the Nation.\" 20 The concept of la nation gave tang ible definition as well as higher legitimacy to the revoluti on.2 1 The revolution acquired spatial dimen-"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"ss F ouNDATIONS oF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH sions and was hencef orth embodied not in complex republican insti­ tutions but in simple conc entric cir cles. The borders of France were an outer, ideolo gical mote ; Paris the inner citadel ; the National Assembly the \"perfect point\" of authority within Paris itself. The revolutionary nation was proclaimed \"indivisibl e,\" and its borders expandab le . The archenemy of the French Revolution, the Abbe Ba rruel , introduced the term \"nationalism\" to denigrate the new form of parochial, secular selfishness that he felt was replacing universal Christian love as the human ideal. 22 Militant nationaHsm reached the European masses largely throug h Napoleon : \"the first ruler to base a political regime exclusively upon the nation . . . the most powerful purely national symbol that any nation has had .\" 23 Some were positively inspired by his example of nationalism (the Poles and ItaHans ); others were neg atively stimulated to form national movements against him (the Spaniards and Prussians ). By the end of his career Na poleon's grande armee had in effect sup­ planted the revolutionary grande nation. That army was two-thirds foreign by the time of its decisive defeat in the \"Battle of the Nat ions\" in 1813 by a coalition of the nationalisms he had awakened throughout Europe . Nationalism remained the major revolutionary ideal until the final quarter of the nineteenth century. Its mysterious power and continuin g mutat ions make essential a closer look at its origins . The birth of this new ideal was both sublime and bloody, involving the heights of music and the depth of terror . The birth of a nation takes us beyond the Paris of Robespierre to the Strasbourg of Saint- Just. The Song from Strasbourg Strasbourg, the largest city of the lower Rhin e, was France's major link with Europe-with a Cat holicism that was more than Gallican (the bishop retained political allegiance to the Holy Roman Emperor ); with a religion that was more than Ca tholic (a third of Strasbourg was Prot­ estant ); and with a culture that was more than French (m ost of the city spoke German ). Strasbourg had been France's most important conti­ nental conquest during the century and a half prior to the revolution. When the upheaval came , this exposed outpost felt particula rly vul­ nerable. The bishop's patrimony was confiscated, the German-speaking university was shut, and the great pentagonal fortress built by Vauban was reinforced by an elite \"army of the Rh ine.\" Strasbourg did not just accept, but amplified and transfor med , the rising new French nationalism -i nternaHzing German ideas even as it combated the external threat of German arms. Unlike Paris, Strasbourg was not distracted by competing factions and multiple political insti­ tutio ns. Its quasi-medieval municipal structure gave Strasbour g rela tive unity within itself and solid arity with the surrounding Alsatian coun try­ side. Even its cafe culture was an esta blishment activity devoid of Parisian license and radiating Gemiitlichkeit .24 The twice-elected Prates-"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Obiects of Belief 5 9 tant mayor of revolutionary Strasbourg, Frederic Dietrich, unified the city with a family having both French and German branches (D idier and Dietri ch ), a multilingual Swiss wife, and a bilingual salon where old antag onisms tended to melt away. In the early beleagured months of 1792, a national consciousness was intensified by the growing sense that an enemy was nea r and war was likely. The normal popul ation of fifty thousand had been swollen by friends of the revolution fleeing from Aus tria and Prussia, and by volunteers from all over France coming to reinforce the garrison city on the Rhi ne. The news that both Germanic mon archs had declared war on revolutionary France reached Strasbourg before Paris ; and, on the night of April 24, 1792, Dietrich commissioned a young engineering captain from his salon, Claude-Joseph Rouget de Lisle, to write a song that would arouse the polyglot army to resist the anticipated Hapsburg attack. In the feverish inspiration of one night, he wrote a song that rallied a people as had no other song since Luther's Ein feste Burg.25 Originally called Chant de guer re de l'armee du Rhin, its surprisin gly bloodthirsty lines were sung with special zest by newly arrived volun­ teers from afar. The contingent from Ma rseilles gave the song from Strasbourg its permanent name : La Marsei llaise. The origin of La Marseillaise in Strasbourg was not accidental, for this was the city in which the rich musical culture of Germany flowed into Franc e. It had both French and German cathedral choi rs, French and German opera houses, and the finest orchestras in prerevolution ary France outside of Paris and Versailles. Strasbourg manufactured instru­ ments as well as melodies. The great piano ma nufacturer Ignace Pleyel became Kapelmeister in the Strasbourg Ca thedral in 1789. Drawing on both Ca tholic page antry and Protestant hymnography, Strasbourg pro­ duced an original revolutionary repertoire, introducing elaborate musi­ cal compositions into open-a ir revolutionary festivals via the Pleyel­ Rouget de Lisle Hymn of Liberty. 2 6 First performed on Sept ember 25, 1791, it used the entire audience as a chorus for the first tim e, a tech­ nique that was only later transported to Paris. The austere words of Rouget renouncing \"the vain delirium of profane gaiet y\" and \"soft vo­ luptuousness\" suggested the revolutionary puritanism that lay ahe ad.27 La Marseillaise was from the beginning a kind of corporate production . When Rouget first presented the rough melody to the ma yor in his salon, Dietrich, who was a tenor, became the first to sing it, and his violin ist wife, the first to orchestrate it. La Marseillaise elect rified the nation going to war. The two leading composers of the Opera Comique, Dalayrac and Gossec, composed Offering to Liberty, Religious scene on the Marseillais e.2s This \"religious scene\" was taken out of the theaters into army camps. Choruses of women knelt before statues of liberty singing the verse, \"Amour sacre de la pat rie . . . \" as a hushed prayer, then rising to sing the final verse with a percussion accompaniment that \"would make the pavement leave the street for the frontier.\" 2 9 The leading composer of the era , Andre Gretry , congratulated Rouget for creating \"musique a coups de canon, \" 30 and in his Guillaume Tell,�l"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"6o F ouNDATIONS oF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AIT H perhaps the most popular new opera of the revolutionary era, began the popular practice of inserting the anthem directly into operatic scores. The tide of passion aro used by music soon engulfed its early patrons. In 1792, Dietrich was swept out of office as a moderate accused of affinities with Lafayette. Musical militance intensified at the Strasbourg celebration of the first anniversary of the founding of the republic on August 10, 1793, when Pleyel and Rouget de Lisle staged their remark­ able The Allegorical Alarm Bell. Described as \"a battle in music,\" the pageant took place in the newly transformed cathedral underneath seven bells suspended from the cu­ pola. The bells (like the enormous chorus and cast ) had been gathered in from all over Alsace; they were to be melted down for cannon im­ mediately after the production . The first part was purely orchestral (\"the arousa l of the people\" ). When alarm bells rang, the second move­ ment (\"the battle\" ) began. Only when all combat was finished did hu­ man voices burst forth for the first time-in a trium phant chorus end­ ing with la victoire est a nous .3 2 So gre at was the Strasbourgeois belief in the unifying power of music that its craftsmen invented a new system for printing the notes of the new na tional music. So great was the fear of evocative melody that the priests, who later restored Ca tholic authority to the cathedral, de­ creed that only bleak plainsong and organ drone would henceforth be permitted in ordinary worship. ss Music reached a special crescendo in Strasbourg precisely during the Terro r. It seems appropri ate that the first guillotine was made by a piano maker in Strasbourg named Schmidt and was first brought to Paris to be used on a living person on April 25, 1792, at almost exactly the moment that Rouget de Lisle was finishing La Marseilla ise.34 Strasbourg brought France the excitement not just of the German musical tradition, but also of the German theater. The antitraditi onal, anti-Hapsburg dramas of Friedrich Schiller were usu ally introduced into France by performances in Strasbourg, and the principal tr anslations of Schiller into French were made by Nicholas Bonnev ille when he was studying in Strasbourg during the 178os. The early German romantics inspired the altogether new type of play that Bonneville wrote in 1789 to commemorate the fall of the Ba stille . It was a Tragedie Nationale designed for the peuples-germains ... peuples- freres worthy of entering a new societe frater nelle.B5 Bonnev ille appealed to Ca mille Desmoulins to institution alize this \"nation al\" genre as a kind of rebuke to \"the lack­ eys of the Court\" who favored light entertainment devoid of moral pur pose.3 6 Strasbourg became the major continental correspondence center for Bon neville's Social Circle, and the place for translating and publishing its works for distribution in the German wor ld.37 Charles Nodier, a later pioneer in secret revolutionary organization and the inventor of the antitraditio nal, partly musical genre of melodrama, discovered Ger­ man literature through Bonnev ille's transl ation s, and dedicated his Es­ says of a Young Bard to Bonneville.

Schneider, a former Capuchin monk, became an Illuminist in Neuwied and a popular pro­ fessor at Bonn until he was dismissed for heresy in June 1791 .39 He led the radical republican overthrow of Ma yor Dietrich, composed the first German translation of La Marseillaise, edited two extremist journa ls. founded a special unit for popular revolutionary indoctrination through­ out Alsace called la Propagande, and served as chief prosecutor of the revolutionary tribunal in Strasbourg.4 o Nodier later recalled with aesthetic fascination an execution where Schneider's \"pr opaga ndists\" wearing red hats and tricolor sashes and with large hunting knives, lectured the spectators.

Schneider took over the German theater in Strasbourg as his headqua rters and popula rized the word \"denunci ation\" in the revolutionary vocabula ry.4 2 The mayor of Strasbourg insisted that the word \"inn\" be substituted for the feudal term \"hotel\" throughout the city,43 and the Germ ans writing in Schneider's journal brought a new flood of rustic meta phors into French revolution ary nationalism. The Prussian Anacharsis Cloots in his Pat riotic Crusade spoke of the French nation's historic right to control the Rhi ne : The mouths of the Rhine, the ancient frontier of Gaul will sing the hymn of liberty in the sh adow of our victorious banner ... let us rush en masse to the banks of the great river, and never again will a German crowd in on the soil of the newborn Fra nce.4 4 Cloots had seen the first festival on the Champs de Mars as a return of the French people to being \"all Germans and all brothers .\" Another German witness compared it to the ancient barbarian ritual in which \"the Franks, a free union of Germ ans, gathered yearly in order to declare to the king the sovereign will of the people.\" 45 The ancient German tribes became a mythic prototype for the sov­ ereign \"people\" within a revolution ary \"nati on.\" Bonneville's alternative to the indulgence and selfishness of modem civilization was a virile , pre-Christian communalism of \"the free man\" (hom me franc) such as Tacitus had described among the early Germ ans. Bonneville praised Frankish tribalism in his Manifesto of the Friends of Truth in 1789; 4 6 later he praised the barbarians over their \"civilized\" oppressors in his \"Prophecy of an Old Druid against the Romans.\" 47 Bonnev ille saw the nation learning from \"the university of na ture ,\" with a modern \"Druid\" like himself helping it rediscover the lost language of truth :"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"62 F ouNDATIONS oF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH La nature est un livre immense a devorer, La langue en est perdue, il faut la recouvrer. 4 8 Nat ure is an immense book to be devoured, Its language is lost and must be recovered. That language was largely Ger man-not just the \"sighs and tears\" of the early romantics so well known to Bonnevi lle, but also the com­ p ound words with abstract apposition s, like Peuple-Dieu, which he im­ ported wholesale into the French language . There were many other con­ tributors to this process in addition to Bonnev ille , Cloots, and their frie nds : J.-G. Saiffert , the doctor of Philip of Orleans who led the short­ lived German leg ion in Paris and was called \"the vand al\" ; 49 A. G. F. Rebmann, the leading publisher of German journals in Par is ; 50 and the Frey brothers, Germ an-spe aking Jews from Strasbourg, one of whom wrote a defense of terror by a minority : Philosophie Sociale. 5 1 In trying to weed out \"the verbiage of the defunct French Academ y\" 52 and \"create a language, make a religion\" 53 for la nation, Bonnevi lle drew heavily on Germanisms and followed the Strasbourg custom of publishing tracts bilingu ally.54 \"People\" (like \"Nation\" and other sym­ bolic substantiv es ) acquired a capital letter in the Germanic fashion in new French phrases like Peuple-Roi, Peupl e-Dieu, and Peuple-Sau­ veur. Cloots's pledge of allegiance to la nation required capital lette rs through out : My profession of faith is as reas suring for the patriot as it is terrible for the treasono us : I BELIEVE IN THE INFALLIBILITY OF THE PEOPLE .55 Partly created by German influences in France, nationalism was first so named by a French exile in Germany, the Abbe Ba rruel. Herder, the original romantic lover of organic variety, had in fact previously used the words Nationalismus and Nationalism in a cultural sense as early as 1774 .5 6 Herder's image of a rustic, virt uous , and musical Ger­ man nation ality was admired by radical French thinkers as they soug ht to define their own \"national\" identity. Long before Madame de Sta el's Germany of 1810 , Schneider's pupil, Charles Nodier, spoke rapturously of ... that marvellous Germany, the last country of poesy and belief in the West, the future cradle of a strong society to come-if there is any society left to be created in Europe .57 For the romantic political imaginat ion , the locus of legitimacy no longer lay in a city, but in a na tion ; that \"nation\" sometimes seemed to spea k with a rustic German accent. The Saint from Picardy By the early fall of 1793, Stra sbourg was dispirited by terror from within and the threat of German occup ation from without.

On October 17, Paris sent a special proconsul of la nation to rally people and collect provisions for the anny of the Rhi ne. In a little over two months in Strasbourg, he curbed the excesses of the extremi sts, energized the indifferent masses, and headed the soldiers, who turned back the invaders in a stunning series of victorie s. The man who led this salvation of the revolutiona ry na tion was the quin­ tessential youthful revolutionary, Louis-Antoine de Saint- Just. Saint-Just gave living legitimacy to the revolutionary ideal. He was by far the youngest member of the twelve-man Committee of Public Safety which exercised executive authority in Paris. But because the commit­ tee met largely in secret in the Tuileries Palace and did not communicate in regular ways with the people, its authority depended heavily on the deeds and examples of those it sent out in the name of the nation .5 8 Unlike other members of the commi ttee, Saint-Just had no prior, practi­ cal experience as a lawyer, engineer, prie st, journalist, or eve n actor. Too young to be anything but a child of the revolution , he became in 1793-94 its embodiment. Legitimacy no longer lay in a place, a symbol, or a song; it lay in a revolution ary apostolate of twelve. The center of ascetic coolness within this heated group was the young man from Picardy whose very name summoned up images of sanctity. The locus of leg itimacy was nar­ rowing to a point : \"that ideal location where the creative and divine forces have their greatest and most potent concent ration .\" 59 The secu­ lar, revolution ary drama was converging, like Da nte's Divine Comedy, toward \"the point in which all time is pres ent.\" 6 0 And that point was not simply Saint-Just himself, but the nerve center within his head. His friend Ca mille Desmoulins wrote that Saint-Just . . . regards his head as the keystone of the republic and carries it on his shoulders with respect like a holy sacrament. 61 Another fascinated contemp orary felt sure that some \"secr et\" was hid­ den behind the \"shade of general anxiety, the somber accent of preoccu­ pation and defiance, an extreme coolness in tone and ma nners\" of his large head. Saint-Just's leadersh ip role cannot be explained as resulting from the characteristics now often ascribed to revolutionary leaders. He was not \"charismatic\" -lacking Robe spierre's flair for the inspira­ tional and the theatrical. Nor was he particularly \"violent\" -he purged Schneider and ended public executions in Strasbourg. He developed neither the bloodthirsty rhe toric of a Marat nor the theory of violence of an Oswald. Saint-Just was not a moralist, and he was not esse ntially interested in power in the purely political sense. He ceded formal posi­ tions of authority to others and never partook in the practical play of peacetime political deliberation . Saint-Just has been des cribed as \" an idea energized by passion\"; 6 2 he might also be cha racterized as passion disciplined by an idea.

The challenge to a \"great hea rt\" in 178g-go was to beat with the revolution ; his passions soon became absorbed in the two sides of it -the organizational and the ideolog ical-t hat political leaders tended to neglect. Organizationally, he formed a national guard in the small town of Blerancourt and led the guardsmen in such rituals as the public burn­ ing of counter-revolution ary books. Ideologically, he turned to writing (on three tables in the open air) his Spirit of the Revolut ion and his uncompleted and unpublished Nature .67 Saint-Just in effect withdrew from the pettiness and divisions of the old dying order to develop the central beliefs of the new one . He was suspicious of mass movements, and considered the storming of the Bast ille simply \"the drunkenness of slaves\" and the great festivals the sta ging grounds for demagogu es.6 8 Nor was he interested in the rights of man or the formulas of const itution s. These were the work of \"petty thieves in the holy sanctuary.\" 69 He went beyond Rousseau's social contract ( contrat social) in his call for a new social order ( etat social ) \"founded solidly only on na ture .\" 7° With no vision of the future , almost no knowledge of the past, and surprisingly little concern with the present , Saint-Just became the first ascetic of the revo lution, cutting himself off from people in order to serv e \"the people\" tot ally :"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Obje cts of Belief I shall speak of all peoples, of all religions, of all laws as if I myself did not adhere to any . . .

His removal from the society of his day was the indis­ pensa ble psychological prerequisite to his revolution ary conception of nature as ... a totality saturated with moral content ... at one and the same time \"paradise lost\" and the permanent possibility of beginning everything anew.7 2 Saint-Just, however, provides the first suggestion of the total re­ moval from normal attachments later called for in the Revolut ionary Catechism of Nechaev, who enjoined revolutionaries to cut \"every tie with the civil order, with the educated world, and with all laws.\" 73 Arguing that \"all is relative in the world\" and \"truth alone is ab­ solute,\" Saint-Just saw the only hope for ending \"the circle of corruption\" in a retur n to \"original virtue\" -a secularized inversion of original sin. 74 \"Original virtue\" implied renewed communion with the primitive sim­ plicity of nature. Elected as a represent ative to the Convention in September 1792 , Saint-Just returned to Paris just after the founding of the Republic and proclaimed the Convention to be \"the point toward which everything is compr essed.\" 75 The legislator converging on such a sacred spot is not to be a sophist dea ling with wor ds, but an \"oracle\" or a pontifex in the original Roman sense of a human bridge between higher truth and a confused humani ty.7 6 Assigning himself this larger-than-human role at the center of power, Saint-Just quietly became in October secretary to the main office of the Convention and the most powerful advocate of regicide on the floor of the Assembly. His argument for killing the king was totally impersonal and dispassionate. The monarch was not con­ sidered a human being at all, but a universal abstracti on, \"the King of Kingdo ms.\" He was the counterpoint to the new point of sovereign power in the Convention ; and Saint-Just impelled that body forw ard to the revolutionary point of no return, arguing against \"a compassion which involuntarily corrupts one's energy.\" 77 His radical simplification provided at last a compelling met aphor for the French na tion to replace that of the king's body just as it was being severed. He revived the old image of the human body itself, which personalized the agony and affections of the nation in a way that the mechanistic meta phors of the eighteenth century never could. \"The enemies of the republic are in its intestine s.\" Its leaders are largel y \"worm s.\" The best hope lies in a \"great heart\" and \"great nerves\" as well as in \"the audacity of ma gnanimous virtue.\" 78 Saint-Just ex­ pressed model revolutionary contempt for individual good deeds in a \"sick\" socie ty: The particular good one does is a palliative.

That which produces the general good is always terrible . 79 His image of the nation as a single body made any loss of territory as painful as an amputation. In the early spring of 1793 he saw the nation threatened with death \"if division is attached to territory,\" s o and set off on the first of three special missions to rally the resistance in exposed provinces. Working on the Constitutional Committee of the Convention , he failed in his campaign to create an eighty-four member executive formed from a nerve center in each departmen t; but he suc­ ceeded in inserting into the Constitution of 1793 an unprecedented constitutional provision against ever making peace with a foreign power occupying any French territory. 81 In his great speech on October 10, 1793, calling for a revolution ary dictatorship, Saint-Just denounced all traditional government as \"a world of paper\": The prolixity of governmental correspondence and orders is a mark of inertia; it is impossible to govern without laconicism .... The bureaus have replaced the monarchy; the demon of writing makes war upon us and we cannot govern. B 2 With the Committee of Public Safety now \"placed in the center,\" the cause of all misfortune in the nation had been determined to be \"the vicissitude of passions.\" 8 3 The only passion that could give constancy to the nation prior to the inculcation of virtue was terror, which he sa w as a means not of punishing crime, but of fanning popular energy and audacity. Although Saint-Just's argument for terror was reluctant and his use of it in Alsace limited, his legitim ation of it encouraged the fresh wave of pedagogic violence that began with the public execution of Marie Antoinette on October 16. Saint-Just left for Strasbourg the next day; on the day following a new pla y opened in Paris that introduced the metaphor of a volcano into the previously tranquil image of an island utopia. Despite the urgent need for explosives at the front, the Com­ mittee of Public Safety authorized the delivery of twenty pounds of saltpeter and powder to the Theater of the Republic to produce the on­ stage volcanic eruption that pitched rocks and smoldering charcoal into the audience at the end of Sylvain Marechal's Last Judgment of Kings.84 This was precisely the image that Saint-Just had used long before the revolution in connection with his first discussi on of \"terror\"; 8 \" and Marechal's enormously successf ul play in a way substituted a new \"nat­ ural\" image as a focus of awe and terror in place of the guillotine, which Saint-Just had avoided using for public executions in Strasbourg. There was a sugges tion of orgasm in the Saint-Just -Man§chal image of eruption-just as there was a suggest ion of nudity in Marechal's subse­ quent opera depicting a priest sheddin g his robes \"to renounce my imposture ... in the eyes of nature.\" s 6 Saint- Just, too, turned to the emotive power of music.

His Selico au les negres was apparently built around the intense friendship of two brothers involved in slaying a tyran t; this sense of masc uline comradesh ip-in­ arms enabled Saint-Just to identify the nation with brotherhood in an almost physiological way. ss Brought up entirely by his mother and sisters, Saint-Just discovered la fraternite along with la nation. On his first mission of mobilization to the provin ces in the spring of 1793, he wrote that the nation \"is not at all the sun, it is the community of affection s.\" 89 His posthumously published vision of an ideal society promotes his concept of brothers­ in-a rms into quas i-erotic attachment. He proposes that every twenty­ one-ye ar-old declare his friendships publicly in the temple and repeat the ritual at the end of every winter. If a man leaves a friend, he is required to explain the motives behind it bef ore the people ; and \"is banished if he refuses ... [or] says he has no frien ds, or renounces his beliefs in friendship .\" Friends are to fight in battle together; are held responsible for each other's cri mes ; and \"those who remain united all their life are to be buried in the same tomb.\" 9 o Saint-Jus t's worshipful companion on the mission to Strasbourg, Le Bas, felt the same kind of fraternal loyalty that Saint-Just in turn showed to Robe spierre . Saint-Just never distanced himself from Robespie rre at the end, as he might easily have done. He never mar­ ried, and his engagement to Le Bas's sister seems to have been ma inly a token of friendship for his companion in Als ace. Militant fraternity in the service of the nation allowed no room for sorority-or indeed for fraternization with women. Saint-Just and Le Bas dest royed Schneider in Strasbourg for indulging not just in dis­ tractive sex and excessive viole nce, but also for taking a German wife , Sarah Stamm, at the height of the battles with foreign invaders in December. Schneider had threatened both the ethnic and the sexual homogeniety of the French legio ns; his wife was executed along with him in April, 1794. n A foreign threat was once again coupled with feminine temptation in the case of Etta Palm d' Aelders, the radical feminist within Bonneville's Confedera tion , who was denounced for foreign links .9 2 In late 1793, the nation was applying standards of loyalty that were more exclusive, Spa rtan , and homophile than anyone educated in the cosmopolitanism of the Enlightenment could have imagined. At the popular level, too, a sudden surge of feminine participation in revolutionary activity was permanently repre ssed during the nationalist mobilizat ion of late 1793. An \"Amazon corps\" of four thousand young women had appeared briefly in Bordeaux and a feminine \"Friends of Liberty and Equ ality\" in Lyon .93 Within Paris, women \"took the most violent initiative and sur passed by a good deal the fury of men\" 94 in the debates of May 31, 1793, which moved power out of the Assembly and into the streets. All of this feminine activity vanished along with the Revolution ary Republican Society, a Parisian society of female sans­ culottes, which became \"the first target of the Jacobin assault upon the"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"68 F ouNDATIONs OF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH popular movement\" 0\" in the fall of 1793. Its demand for women to wear the red cap of male revolutionaries outraged the central revolu­ tionary leaders. On October 3 r, the Convention outla wed all female clubs and societ ies. The antifeminine sentiment that swept through Paris was almost certa inly related to the parallel process of mobilizing men for military servi ce. The unprecedented levee en masse involved tearing thousands of young men away from their mothers and linking them together by the masculine mystique of militant nationalism. Female and foreign identities were already blended together. The word for \"Austrian\" was spelled in the feminine form even when French grammar called for a masculine ending .n G Whether or not the red hat was a ph allic symbol as Joel Ba rlow contende d, the wea ring of it by women in Paris clearly seemed to threaten the male leadership. Fa bre d'Eglantin e, one of the principal choreographers of the revolutionary festivals, invoked a kind of domino theory of prospect ive feminine annexations of male weaponry/sexuality. After the bonnet rouge, women would take the gun belt and then the gun itself, he warn ed.97 The official report to the Convention on the role of women urged against any participation in politics by a sex that is congenitally \"exposed to error and seduct ion\" : ... women, by their constitution, are open to an exaltation which could be ominous in public life . The interests of the state would soon be sacrificed to all the kinds of disruption and disorder that hysteria can produ ce.98 The hysteria was largely in the minds of the men who voted-w ith only one dissenting vote in the entire Convention-to outla w all women's associ ation s. In this atmosphere , Ma rie Antoin ette , who had been relatively neglected as a target of abuse in the early years of the revoluti on,99 became a target for a savage hatred that bordered at times on sadism. Her execution on October r6 began a series of public guillo­ tinings of the great symbolic women of the era in a short space of time . Charlotte Corday, the killer of Marat, Olympe de Gouges, author of a Declaration of the Rights of Women, and finally the Girondist leader Madame Roland on November 8-a ll provided spectacula r executions for the Parisian masses. The popular imagination , which had already substituted inexpensive etchings for aristocratic engrav ings, 1 o o re­ ceived its gynephobic icon in the form of Da vid's pencil sketch of an ugly, but still arro gant, Ma rie Antoinette on the way to her humiliating end. The contrast is striking in both medium and message with the ide alized neo-classical male nude wa rriors that were to dominate David's vast oil canvases in glorification of la grande nation. Subcon­ scious fear of revenge might well explain the strange apprehension that later haunted both Robesp ierre and Saint-Just of being assassinated by women. l01 As the very embodiment of militant, male fraternite, Saint-Just wrote to Robespierre from Alsace that there were \"too many laws -t oo few example s.\" 1 02 In the last months of his life , Saint-Just observed the \"stric test aus terity of habit,\" avoided all contact with women, l O:l and led the struggle against indifference and factionalism .lo4 Late in April"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The Objects of Belief 6g of 1794, he journeyed to the front with Le Bas one final time to share in the great victory at Fleurus late in June. When the vanquished Aus­ trians before Charleroi brought him an envelope with terms of sur­ render on June 25 and beg an speaking to him of honorable arrange­ ments, Saint-Just interrupted them to say that he would not open it, and demanded unconditional surre nder : We cannot either honor or dishonor you here, just as it is not in your power to either dishonor or to honor the French nation. There is nothing in common between you and me. l 0 5 Ironically, the victory that assured the survival of the na tion removed the need for terror and for the emergency that had justified the first governmental body ever to des cribe itself officially as \"revolutionary.\" Robes pierre and Saint-Just were both executed and the Committee of Public Safety dissolved a month after the victory. As befits the chiarascuro politics of apocaly pse, there was one final fabulous feast of fraternity just before the fall of Robe spierre . If the Feast of Federat ion in 1790 had represented \"the first day of the sublime dream of fraternity,\" 1 o 6 Robespierre's spectacular Feast of the Supreme Being on June 8, 1794, suggested the beginning of its unending sum­ mer. The winter, the foreign arm ies, and the guillotine all seemed to have passed; and the last stage in revolution ary simplification had oc­ curred with Robespierre's election as president of the Convention and proclamation of a new religion of maximum simplici ty : \"the Cult of the Supreme Being.\" Designed to be the first in a series of regular national festivals , the Feast of the Supreme Being turned the volcano into a peaceful moun­ tain of floral beauty and choral unison on the Field of Mars. Women were admitted and given a separate but equal place in the hitherto homophilic rituals. Even the ascet ic Saint-Just saw in the proceedings the beginnings of a pedag ogic program that might truly inculcate virtue in a corrupt world. Here at last was Sparta plus song. Paris had been transformed not into a city based on some preexisting con­ ception , but into \"an eternal model of assembly, simplicity and joy.\"1°7 In hailing the Supreme Being, Robe spierre proclaimed that its \"true priest\" was \"nature\" : ... its temple, the universe; its cult, virtue ; its festivals the joy of a great people ... renewing the sweet bonds of universal fraternity . l OB The euphoria was short-l ived, though much of the new secu lar sim­ plicity survived together with many of the national festivals in the Cult of Theophilanthropy under the Directory. The \"fraternal me als\" of the last weeks of Robesp ierre's rule 109 and the \"fraternal embrace\" which ended the festival were followed by a final, fratricidal burst of terror and fac tionalism which brought down the emergency government. Saint-Just illustrated within the leadership the mass phenomenon within the populace of dedicated young soldiers harnessing their pas­ sion to a na tional cause. He was a prototype for the ascetic revolu-"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"F OUNDATIONS OF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH tionary of the future. Through him the locus of legitimacy moved away from physical place and political formula to living example. That example was made awesome by the icy calm, the sang-froid,1 1 ° he maintained throughout the quarreling and violence of his last days . Saint-Just had the serenity of one who had surrendered himself long before death to a transcendent ideal, to \"the spirit of the revolution ,\" and realized the goal of human \"regeneration .\" The passion of Saint-Just was cold rather than hot. It imploded into intelligence rather than exploding into indulgence. That intelligence charted a course of constancy and toughness in the turbulent final weeks of rule by the Committee of Public Safety. He resisted both Robesp ierre's apparent moves to make peace with foreign enemies and his tendency to personalize his struggles with moderate s. At the same time, Saint-Just seems to have been far bolder than Robespierre in at­ tempting to appeal over the heads of the Convention to the revolu­ tionary army in a final effort to forestall the conservat ive drift. Whatever his exact role, Saint-Just retained till the end a cool con­ tempt for the \"dust\" of ordinary life, the \"softness\" and idleness of those who gave themselves over to the process of corruption rather than to that of regenerati on.111 The \"spirit of the revolution\" was resisted not just by \"the force of things\" -about which he often impatiently com­ plained ; there was also the lack of force among revolutionaries them­ selves- the backsliding from l'esprit de la revolution into le bon esprit of aristocratic salons: ... l'esprit is a sophist which leads all virtues to the scaffold. 11 2 Within the proud head of Saint-Just as he went to la sainte guill otine may have lain that most sublime of all contradict ions in revolution ary thought : the need for a tyranny of virtue to prevent the recurrence of tyranny surrounded by vice. His apparent attempt to by-pass the Con­ vention with the army, his revelation that Augustus Caesar was his greatest hero of antiquity, his mysterious references to Oliver Cromwe ll, and Robespierre's final likening of him to Charles IX, author of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre 113-all indicate that this just saint who sought no personal power may have felt impelled to justify absolute power. The national ideal of fraternity reached its apogee in the execution of Saint-Just following the Roman suicide of his younger revolutionary \"brother,\" Le Bas. The rival ideal of communitarian equality appeared during the Thermidorean reaction that followed. Its leader, Babeuf, was, like Saint-Just, a native of Picardy with a similar nostalgia for agrarian simplicity and antique virtue in a corrupted world.H4 Its supreme cultural expression was not Robespierre's singing festival of fraternity, but Sylvain Marechal's prosaic Manifesto of Equals.

Everything has changed in the physical order; everything must change in the moral and political order. Half of the world revolution is already done, the other ha lf must be completed . . . ,115 Equality : The Vision of Community The third new ideal to arise out of the French Revolution was that of communaute : a new type of social and economic community based on equality. Though this ideal was the least arti culated at the time (and the least important politically throughout the nineteenth century ), it has important roots in the revolution ary era. The revolution ary egali­ tarianism of Ba beuf, Ma rechal , and Restif de la Bretonne is the progeni­ tor of modern Communism -a nd of revolution ary socialism, the rival ideal of revolutionary na tionalism. The new ega litarian communalism was rooted in Rousse au's call for a social contract that would repudiate inequa lity among men and leg iti­ mize authority by permitting the \"general will\" to unify the community on a new basis. Rousseau's contract was generally interpreted in purely political terms during the French Revolution , but the germs of a socio­ economic interpretation also emerged from two sourc es : the rhetoric of the American Revolution and the reality of the French countryside. The American Decla ration of Independence offered as its first philo­ sophical justification of separ ation from England the ideological as­ sertion \"that all men are created equal.\" By pronouncing this to be \"self-evide nt,\" the Declaration also initiated the tendency of revolu­ tionary publicists to proclaim the obviousness of truths that had never before even been thought about by more than a handful . The more secular French Declaration of Rights in 1789 proclaimed men to be equal only \"in respect of their rights\" ; but later revolution aries thought also of the \"pursuit of happiness\" proclaimed by the Americ ans- and the radical Cons titution of 1793 affirmed (as the Americans never did) that \"common happiness\" ( le bonheur commun ) was the aim of society and \"oppression against the body of socie ty'' (corps social) a justifica­ tion for insurrecti on. u s The proto-communist idea that \"common happiness\" might be realized at the expense of private property ownership began to appear rel atively early in the cosmopolitan Parisian circles that ultimately proved anathema to the na tionalistic Jacobin leaders. A petition on \"the agrarian laws\" by an Anglo-Irishman James Rutledge, who called him­ self a \" c i t i z en of the universe, \" urged in 1790 the est ablishment of a"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"7 2 F ouNDATIONS OF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH social order ( etat social ) with \"no ownership of property.\" 117 This idea of a lex agraria, a modified land distribution in the manner of Tiberius and Caius Gracchus during the Roman Repub lic , was syst em atically propagated at the same time by Bonneville's principal collaborator in the Social Circle , the Abbe Fauchet. 1 1 8 The idea became a special fa­ vorite of the provincial clergy who identified with their rural parishes. The Abbe Cournand went even further, decla ring that \"in the state of nature, the dom ain of man is the ent ire earth\" and arguing that all land­ owners should have plots equal in size, non-hereditary, and non-trans­ ferr able. 1 19 Other \"red curates\" found an almost religious exalt ation in identifying with the masses and articulating a social ideal that went be­ yond Parisian politics to suggest secular salvation. Thu s, Pierre Dolivier was almost saintly in self -denigration as he petitioned for acceptance into the Bonneville-Fauchet Universal Confederation. I am, he said , the lowliest of men : ... simple and even too simple, without knee britches and without a hearth (s ans culottes et sans feu ), but not without passion for the work of bringing into being the kingdom of universal justice.1 2o This universal ideal found local roots in the grie vances of the French countrysi de. These were brought to Paris in Ma y 1790 by Franc;ois­ Noel Ba beuf, a young prisoner from Picardy who had led a local tax revolt against the continued levying of indirect taxes by the Na tional Assembly. Ba beuf had been brought up in the country, trained as a com­ missioner of land deeds, and studied land utilization but with rela­ tively little interest in politics. In Paris, he discovered the concept of the agrarian law by est ablishing links first with Rutledge and then with the Universal Confederation , 121 which gave an ideological cast to his earlier primitive ideas about a \"collective lease\" ( ferm e collecti ve) and the redistr ibution to the poor of confiscated church lands .1 22 His opposi­ tion to the moderate political revolution was dramatically signaled by an attack on Lafayette in the summer of 1790. This Letter of a Deputy from Picardy was distributed in the Palais-Royal, 12 3 where Ba beuf drew up plans to publicize a radical feminist Conf ederation des Dames, per­ haps in connection with the Universal Confederation. 1 24 He identified the communal government in Paris with local rural au­ thority in common opposition to the parasitic na tional government . Elected as administrator of the depa rtment of the Somme in September, 1792, he returned to Paris to adopt in the spring of 1793 the name \"Gracchus\" in his quest for \"real economic equalit y\" ( egalite de fait) and some new kind of \"general happiness unknown throughout the ages.\" 12 5 It is to that revolutiona ry sea rch that we must now turn.

Babeuf had known Rutledge even bef ore the revolutio n, and late in 1789 he signed on as a regular corre spondent from provincial Roye for the interna­ tional Courrier de l'Europe published in London. 1 26 Arri ving in Paris in February, 1793, Ba beuf joined the agitational \"legion of people's lib­ erators ,\" serving as secretary to the Franco-Haitian Claude Fournier, who had led the storming of the Ba stille from the Pala is-Royal and kept the name \"the Americ an .\" 127 He then briefly became secretary to a Dutch officer in cha rge of the Ba tavian legion 1 2 8 before retreating to the food administration of the Paris Commune. When Fournier was not chosen to lead the revolution ary assault against the conservat ive uprising in the Vendee, Ba beuf appea rs to have despa ired of finding a meaningful role in the exciting events of 1793. During a period when nationalist armies were singing La Marseillaise rather than reading proto-socialist tracts, Ba beuf wrote to his protector Sylvain Marechal that he envied Rousseau's capacity to susta in himself by writing music : I have no such talent, and am therefore more unhappy. But I shall le arn to compose with typography. 1 2 9 He became a master composer in his chosen medium . In and out of prison during the Reign of Terror, Ba beuf repeatedly turned to typog­ raphy and journalism. His perennial protector Marechal directed him first to Bonne ville's press of the Social Circle in April and then to his own Revolutions de Paris in December of 1793.1 30 After the over­ throw of Robespie rre , newspapers became \"more of an arm of struggle than a source of information\" ; l R l and Ba beuf founded in September, 1794, his own arm, Journal of the Freedom of the Press, hailing jour­ nalism as the means of keeping alive the revolution ary spirit and struggling to implement the Const itution of 1793. His ideas soon went beyond radical republicanism and the denunci ation of Robe spierre's tyranny. He began to discover posthumously in Robespier re \"the genius in whom resided true ideas of regenerati on\" ; 13 2 and, in 1795, he founded his Tribune of the People : the first journal in history to be the legal arm of an extralegal revolution ary conspiracy. Ba beuf's Tribune was an organ of strategy, not just an outlet for rhet­ oric. Its criticism of other revolutionary journals and its effort to define a coherent line make it a distant ancestor of Lenin's Iskra and Pravda ; and its prospectus defined a social goal as well as a moral missi on. At the head of each issue stood the italicized phrase, \"The aim of society is the happiness of the communi ty.\" l3 R Ba beuf rejected the \"right of property\" guaranteed in the Declarat ion of Rights of Ma n in favor of the \"state of community\" , 134 arguing that society should provide \"com­ mon happiness\" through \"perfect equality.\" 135 Alongside the journ alistic proclamation of a new social ide al came a new type of revolution ary orga nization . The national network of Jaco­ bin clubs, which had been largely destroyed by the overthrow of Robes­ pier re , was no longer taken as the model. In a long ma nifesto of No­ vember 1794, \"On the need and means of organizing a true popular"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"74 F ouNDATIONS oF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH society,\" he likened the relationship between earlier \"clubists\" and the masses to that of \"the Christian sermonizer vis-a-vis the benevolent congregation.\" He called for a militant society to end all subservience to the \"aristocracy of riches\" and to begin \"the reign of republican virtues.\" 1 3 6 Arrested in March 1795, Babeuf used his six-month imprisonment in Arras to perfect his ideas of a true \"popular society.\" All were to be equal and dedicated to developing collectively commerce, agriculture , and (in a striking addition for this period) industry. Such a society was to come about through a new geographical base and a new militant organizati on. In an important letter of July 28, Babeuf provided per­ haps the first outline of a program for completing the revoluti on, and anticipated the later idea of a secure base area for militant revolu­ tionaries. 1 37 He speaks variously of \"our Vendee,\" 1 3 8 the \"Sacred Moun­ tain,\" or \"the plebeian Vendee. \" 139 \"Advancing by degree, consolidating to the extent that we gain terri­ tory, we should be able to organi ze.\" 1 4 0 \"Enemies of the human race\" fear the militance of \"numerous phalanxes\" 1 4 1 by revolutionaries who will give up their traditional occupations to advance the struggle. Babeuf fled backward in time and forward in revolutionary conscious­ ness when he moved from the ideal of a Roman legion to that of a Greek phalanx as the model for the revolutionary struggle. His effort to form a \"phalanx of sans-culottes\" in the spring of 1793 failed, but the image reappeared in Saint-Just's call for new forms of socio-military support for the revolution ary government in October. Anacharsis Cloots, the deracinated \"orator of the human race,\" saw the revolu­ tionary army of France not as a national body at all, but as the new Greeks fighting for all civilization as ... phalanxes of interpreters, of translators of the universal law. 1 4� Babeuf used the term phalange for the formations needed to realize the social as well as the military discipline of his new communautl?; and the term was to have a venerable history in subsequent revolu­ tionary usage. 1 43 The original phalanx in search of a new society arose directly out of revolutionary journalism. Late in 1795, the Club of the Pantheon began meeting by torchlight in the crypt of the Convent of Sainte Genevieve (\"the Cave of Brigands\" ) to discuss the program of Babeuf's Tribune. Babeuf, who had r eturned to Paris in September 1795, assumed leader­ ship of the club, which claimed two thousand members. Accused of fomenting civil war, Babeuf invented the classica l revolutionary riposte that such a war already existed : the war of the rich against the poor. 1 44 He accepted with pride the accusations of his foes that his friends were \"anarchists . . . men who want to be always making revolution.\" 1 45 In November, Babeuf published the first in the new genre of social revolutionary manifestos which would culmin ate in Marx's Communist Manifesto of 1848. Babeuf's Plebeian Manifesto was both a philosophical"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The Objec ts of Belief 75 inventory (a manifest of what was needed to bring about \"equalit y in fact\" and \"the common good\" ) and a call for a popular uprising (a manifestation, \"greater, more solemn, more general than has ever been done before\" ). 1 4 6 When a police raid led by the young Na poleon Bonaparte shut down the Club of the Pantheon on February 28, 1796, Babeuf and his associates turned their atten tion inward on their \"Conspiracy of the Equals .\" Seek­ ing now to revive rather than revile the dictat orial methods of Robes­ pierre, they constituted themselves on March 30 as the Secret Directory of Public Safety. Decisions of the directory were reached collect ively and announced anonym ously.147 In place of individual signatures on leaflets and let­ ters, there was the designation \"public safety\" or the words of the revolutionary trinity in triangular form -with \"common happiness\" substituted for \"fraterni ty.\" 148 Each member of the central insurrection­ ary committee was to be concurrently active in other areas from which he could report back to the inner circle. The secret center was to communicate outward through a network of twelve trusted \"instruc­ tors ,\" with each responsible for mobilizing a broader insurrectionary force in one of the twelve arrondis sements of Paris. The secret direc­ tory met almost every evening. It published in printings of at least two thousand not only the theoretical Tribun du Peuple, but also a fly sheet, L'Eclaireur du Peuple for the ordinary worker.149 Methods of mobilization included the act ive enlistment of affiliates by small groups of activists or grou pistes, who gathered around newly and prominently displayed revolutionary posters. The number of those loosely recruited grew to seventeen thousa nd,15 0 and the conspiracy increasingly focused on the army as the crucial recruiting ground for insurrection. The de­ cision to put a military committee of the conspiracy directly in touch with the secret directory enabled an informer to discover the inner circle and expose it to police arr estJ51 The consp irators were guardians not only of the revolution ary hope for social equa lity, but also of the vision of Saint-Just that true revolu­ tion would take men beyond polit ics. All governm ent-a nd not just some governm ents-w ould somehow be dest royed by a true revolution . \"To politic\" (politiquer ) was a verb invoked with contempt by Babeuf, whose Plebe ian Manifesto ended with a call for \"total upheaval\" (boul­ eversement total ). \"May everything return to chaos, and out of chaos may there emerge a new and regenerated wor ld.\" 152 The conspiracy envisaged the estab lishment of a \"great national communi ty\" in which all goods were owned in common and shared equally. This \"commu­ nity\" was eventually to supplant-by either attractive example or co­ ercive for ce-all other systems of political and economic authority. Imperceptibly within Babeuf's conspiracy arose the myth of the un­ finished revolution : the idea that the political upheaval in France was only the forerunner of a second, more portentous social revoluti on. Babeuf's journal called in 1795 for the reality rather than the appear­ ance of revolution :"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"F OUNDATIONS OF THE R EVOLUTIONAHY F AITH Ce n'est plus dans les esprits qui'il faut faire la revolution ... c'est dans les choses . . . _153 A few months later in 1796 Babeuf explained that \"the epoch of these great revolutions\" had created a situation ... where a general upheaval in the system of property ownership is in· evitable ; where a revolt of the poor against the rich is a necessity that noth­ ing can preven t. 1 5 4 Already in his Plebe ian Manife sto, Babeuf had begun to develop a sense of messianic mission, invoking the names of Moses, Joshua, and Jesus, as well as Rousseau, Robespierre, and Saint-Just. He had claimed Christ as a \"co-athlete\" and had written in prison A New History of the Life of Jesus Chris f.l55 Most of the conspirat ors shared this belief in Christ as a sans-culotte at heart if not a prophet of revolution . The strength of the red curates within the social revolutionary camp in­ tensified the need to keep Christian ideas from weakening revolution ary dedication. Anacharsis Cloots helped break up Bonneville's Social Cir­ cle by attacking the Abbe Fauchet for extolling the levelers of the Puritan Revolution. Cloots juxtaposed the certainty of Nature (\"always living, always young, always the same\") to the ambiguities and contra­ dictions of the Gospels.156 The antique ideal that the Babeuvists adopted as an alternative to Christianity was that of the Spartans-militant, ascetic, rooted in the land, and deeply hostile to the artificially cerebral and crassly commercial life of the new \"Athens\" : bourgeois Paris under the Directorate .157 But the only sure antidote to the vestigial appeal of Christian ideas lay in atheism, which was the special contribution to the Babeuf conspiracy of Sylvain Marechal, the man who called himself l'HSD, l'homme sans dieu, and produced for the revolutionary movement a totally secular version of the messia nic idea of a Second Coming. Marechal had repeatedly declared that \"the revolution will not be com­ plete until men share the fruits of the earth as they share the rays of the sun.\" 1 58 His neglected Correct ive to the Revolution, written at the height of revolutionary exaltation in 1793, insisted that The Revolution is not complete .... The revolution is still only in words and all in theory. It does not yet exist in fact.1 5 9 Marechal said the revolution was not yet real, because men were not happier; they would never find happiness without higher principl es; and they could never discover such principles under conditions of social inequality : Tant qu'il y aura des valets et des maitres, des pauvres et des riches .... La Revolution n'est point fai te.1 60 In another study of 1795, Marechal added an element of urgency, sug­ gesting that the preceding, purely political revolution may have made life even worse. \"Merchants have become aristocrats, a thousand times more dreadful than the feudal nobility .\" 161"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The Objects of Belief 77 It was only a short step to the prophecy of the Manifesto of Equals which Marechal wrote for Babeuf's group: The French Revolution is but the precursor of another revolution, far greater, far more solemn, which will be the last. 1 6 2 Babeuf was arrested and the conspiracy destroyed on May 10, 1796. In his court defense and final letters, he appeared surer of his role than of his ideas-dea ling with the government often as if he were another governm ent. He viewed himself as the precursor of something new, and bade farewell in a moving last letter to his family as he prepared for a \"perfectly virtuous sleep.\" 1 6 3 The conspiracy sounded a reprise on many themes of the revolu­ tionary faith. The solar myth of the revolution blended with the cafe breeding ground of activism in the Chant des Egaux sung at the Cafe des Bains-Chino is: Sortez de la nuit profonde . . . . Le Soleil luit pour tout le monde ! 1 6 4 This song was itself the revolutionary counter to the Reveil du peuple, introduced after Thermidore as the reactionaries' rival to La Marseillaise. Just as the greatest Christian theologians had defined God as \"the coincidence of opposites,\" so Babeuf took the new faith in revolution to the level of sublime paradox. The justification for launching a new revolution was to \"terminate the revolution\" ; 1 6 5 the means of ending \"the spirit of domination\" was to obey an elite hierarchy ; and the way to avoid the tyranny of \"factions\" was to accept a single leader. The miraculous move to true popular sovereignty was to take place on a springtime \"Day of the People\" in which some seventeen thousand direct supporters 1 66 were to rise up in Paris at signals from bells and trumpets. This apocalyptical political act would bring an end to poli­ tics.1 6 7 Born out of the vision of island utopias, this realization of instant equality planned to banish opponents immediately to preselected islands in the Atlantic and Mediterranean J 6 8 Few accepted Babeuf's egalitarian ideal; but many were haunted by his example. There were, moreover, some grounds for fearing that the conspiracy had foreign links. Representatives of the radical Batavian Republic (the revolutionary regime proclaimed amidst continuing chaos in the Netherlands in 1795-and the first anywhere to adopt officially the revolutionary slogan liberty, equality, fraterni ty) had some contacts with the French conspirators . Babeuf had once served in the Batavian Legion, and a major uprising by cannoneers of the national guard oc­ curred in Amsterdam on the same day that Babeuf was arrested in Paris.l69 There were echoes of the Babeuf conspiracy in the two coun­ tries that in many ways dominated the revolution ary tradition during the early nineteenth century : Italy and Poland. Babeuf's Italian collaborators sought e arl y in 1796 to p ersuade the rul­ ing Directory in Paris to support an uprising of \"popular movements\" in Italy that would lead to a \"general revolution\" and a unitary state"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"F ouNDATIONS OF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH aligned with France. Guglielmo Cerise, Babeuf's former secretary, and Buonarroti, his future historian, sought to organize and promote a rev­ olution in Piedmont that would confront the French authorities with a fait accompli -and push the Directorate closer to the Babeuvist posi­ tion. Buonarroti argued eloquently against French military rule in Italy, urging instead \"the prompt formation of popular authorities\" by the local populace. 1 7° But his revolutionary vision was derided by French military leaders, 1 7 1 who launched under Napoleon a conventional mili­ tary invasion in April. The entry of French troops into Italian villages was celebrated, however, not with local uprisin gs, but with Catholic masses-prompting a friend of Buonarroti's to complain bitterly: One does not found a democracy with a mag nifi cat. Instead of illuminat­ ing churches, it would be better to light up (t hat is, to burn ) feudal castles. 1 72 Frustrated in Piedmont, Babeuvist activists moved on to Milan, where they briefly helped organize a local militia and introduced the Italian tricolor prior to the arrival of Napoleon. The Babeuvists helped form the hierarchical revolutionary organization the Society of Lights (or Black League ), founded by Cerise and others in Bologna late in I 798. Though this organization failed to realize what Godechot has called the best opportunity to unify Italy prior to 186o, it did leave a legacy of experience with secret, nationwide revolutionary organization which was later to benefit the CarbonariJ73 The echo of Babeuvism from occupied Poland was more distant and muffled. A conspiratorial peasant organizat ion of 1796-97 led by a vet­ eran of both the American and French wars of revolution proclaimed the slogan \"Equality or Death,\" and may have been influenced by the Babeuf conspiracy. 174 Within France, there were flickers of revival among the surviving Babeuvists-notably in July 1799, when they gathered to form a Society of the Friends of Equality and Freedom. Such activity was snuffed out with the arrival of Napoleon later that year.175 Yet the hope did not die that the revolution was not yet complete and might still produce a new morality, if not a new type of man. The coming revolution was to be Babeuf's bouleversement total. Such expectations were intensified by conservative critics like Burke's Ger­ man translator (and the future secreta ry of Metternich), who popular­ ized the phrase \"total revolution .\" 1 7 6 What was the nature of the revolution yet to come? There was a difference-and at times open conflict-between the Saint-Just-Robes­ pierre ideal of a moral revolution within a nation and the Babeuvist belief in a \"universal\" social revolution. But there were human links between the two ideas through the two most important surviving mem­ bers of the conspiracy : Buonarroti and Marechal. For both of them social and moral revolution were one and the same thing. Their shadowy careers point, as we shall see, to some surprising philosophical and organizational roots common to both ideals."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"The Object s of Belief 7 9 The Communism of Restif The revolutionary concept of communaute may have come less from the high culture of the Enlightenment than from the low culture of popular journalism. Babeuf had been influenced by The Year 2440, the prophetic utopian work of one great chronicler of Parisian life, Se­ bastien Mercier. 1 77 The word \"communism\" was introduced to the world by Mercier's friend and fellow journalis tic chronicler of Paris, Restif de la Bretonne : the \"Rousseau of the gutter,\" the \"jean- jacques des Halles.\" 1 78 Restif's verbal invention came out of a life that was-l iterally-fan­ tastic. His literary production filled nearly 250 volumes with cosmic, social, and sexual fantasies that no one has yet fully catalogued. His writings anticipated everything from interplanetary travel to atomic energy, and encomp assed almost every imaginable sexual fetish and perversion . 179 Inexhaustible, erotic energy made him as compulsive as he was cre­ ative. He was possessed with the mystique of the new journalistic me­ dium-inventing hundreds of new words and a bewildering variety of typographical formats. His attachment to printing was almost physio­ logical. He worked for many years as a type-setter and often composed his works directly on his home type-setting equipment without a manu­ script. 180 Every aspect of the formal production of a literary work contributed to his total message. His choice of typography, use of ital­ ics, overuse of capitalization (often in the middle of words), misuse of accents, and endless invention of pseudonyms and neologisms 18 1 -reflected an almost religious fascination with the production of the printed word. Legitimacy for the partisans of egalitarian community flowed from the printing press. Restif's only political activity during the revolution­ ary era was his attempt beginning in 1789 to organize a productive association for printers and typographers. 182 His works provided an unparalleled descriptive panorama of lower-class life. Distinctions be­ tween fact, fiction, and fantasy were swept away by his gushing stream of conscious ness. Restif remained the purest form of self­ centered intellectual from his youthful days in rural Burgundy to his later years as a nocturnal street-walker in Paris. Wherever he was, Restif lived only in his own self-created world of words, his maze of monologue. In 1785, Restif published a review of a book describing a communal experiment in Marseilles. He cited a letter of 1782 from the book's au­ thor, who described himself as an auteur communiste-the first known appearance in print of this word. l8 3 The author, the educational theo­ rist Joseph-Alexandre-Victor Hupay de Fuvea, later submitted a vast, utopian educational plan to his friend in Aix, Mirabeau, when he set off for the Estates-Ge neral in 1789.

J . ROUS­ SEAU, Citizen of Geneva, Investigator of the principles of Human Ed­ ucation.\" 190 A privileged exit from this \"house of meeting\" of the community was shown leading to a special place for \"communities formed by Children married within the Philosophical Community.\" 19 1 This was presum ably a kind of philosophical maste r race living in \"equality and union\" and \"the most perfect sociability.\" 19 2 . . . a Spartan people, the true nursery of a better race of men than ours. 1 93 But where was the new Spartan race to come from? Was there anyone who might really aspire to set up the \"community of moral-economic rule\" based on an egalitarian \"community of goods\"? 19 4 There is no record of any serious attempt being made in the vicinity of Marseilles; but there is in the text ample and altogether prophetic indication that he thought it might most easily be realized in Russia. Hupay-like many philosoph es-was inspired by the ambitious r e­ form plans of Catherine the Great, the prototypical \"enlightened despot.\" Her pretentious early writings led him to believe it might be possible \"to put into practice the beautiful laws of the Republic of Plato,\" to create ''an entire city of philosophers\" which would \"be called Plato­ nopolis.\" 19 5 Such an ideal community would be easier to establish in Russia than in the West precisely because it was an authoritarian so­ ciety with coercive power \"where each lord could more easily become the father and benefact or of his serfs.\" 196 Hupay, however, was an unnoticed minor figure. His letter to Restif in 1782 had been prompted by reading the latter's seminal Le Paysan perverti, ou les dangers de la ville. In the fourth volume of this work, Restif announced his intention to provide a \"new Emile\" that would enrich the pedagogic ideas of Rousseau's original Emile with a social program inspired by Rousse au's Discourse on Inequal ity.

He could be restored to wholeness only by the establishment of a new \"philosophical community\" based on \"the sentiments of the best authors and the principles . . . of the New World.\" 1 98 In 1781, Restif wrote a literary fantasy describing an egalitarian so­ ciety, where there was only one law. All must be common among equals. Each must work for the common good. All must take an identical part in work .1 9 9 This was in many ways the most sophisticated of all the utopian islands to appear in prerevolutionary literature. It depicted not only the innate goodness of the inhabitants of the Island of Christin a, but also the compat ibility of their unspoiled egalitarianism with advanced ideas brought back to the island from \"Megapatag onia\" (an idealized version of France ). Thus the \"French Daedelus\" sought not just to fly away from a decadent France to an island paradise, but rather to res­ cue an egalitarian society from \"the people of the night,\" ruling over it by providing an eighteen-article \"Codex of the Megapat agonians\" which decreed the common ownership of all property and the uniform work obligations that the oppressed islanders secretly wanted. 20 0 An even more ambitious work in the following year introduced the term \"community of goods\" and suggested the \"manner of establishing equality\" in \"all nations of Europe.\" 201 Thus, Restif was able to refer his corresponden t, the self-proclaimed \"communist author,\" to works of his own that had already taken his communist ideas beyond the out­ line in Le Paysan perverti. Communism may in part be one of the new ideas blown back across the Atlantic by the original revolution ary \"wind from Americ a.\" 2 o 2 Both Hupay's \"project\" and Restif's Le Paysan were conceived in 1776. In his comment ary on Hupay's letter, Restif argued that \"the people of brothers of Philadelphia\" have opened the possibility for \"that union and that community of moral and economic rule ... that excludes all vain and external distinct ion.\" Restif spoke of the coming of a supra­ national community that would end \"the puerile rivalry which con­ founds states and drags all of them together into ruin and crime.\" 2o a Even more crucial to the communism of Restif was its close identi­ fication with the peasantry; the peasants had been perverted by the cities, but retained the moral force to build communism. On the eve of the revoluti on, Restif wrote a pamphlet urging that peasants be ad­ mitted as a fourth estate to the Estates-General ; 204 and on the first an­ niversary of the fall of the Bastille, Restif wrote another pamphlet warn­ ing rural Frenchmen coming to Paris for the Feast of Federation against the evils of the city. 2 o 5 Although Restif prided himself on belonging to no club or pa rty, his writings of the early revolutionary period seem to envisage a further uprising (soulevement general) to support his broad plan for social justice:"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"F ouNDATIONS OF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH Mettez toute la nation en communautes . . . faites une insurrection generale, partagez. 2 06 From his appeal for agrarian communalism submitted to the Estates­ General in 1789, he turned in late 1792 and early 1793 to the Con­ vention with an appeal for what he now called his plan de commu­ naute generale . 2 o 1 In Februa ry 1793, Resti£ used the term communism as his own for the first time to describe the fundamental change in ownership that would obviate the need for any further redistribution of goods and property. zos His detailed exposition of communism (and regular use of the word) began the following year with a \"Regulation . . . for the establishment of a general Community of the Human Race\" in his Monsieur Nicolas or the human heart unveiled. 20 9 In this work, Resti£ insisted that the absolute elimination of private property would end human need but not individual initiative. He saw communism as a more effective cause for rallying the French army than the \"uncom­ pleted republic\" of the Directory. The republicanism of the post­ revolution ary United States was also attacked for providing only \"nom­ inal\" equality. 21 o In a communist society, all citizens would accept the obligation to work-and to declare publicly their annual production goals at the beginning of each year. Neither possess ions nor professions could be passed on from father to son.2 1 1 Communism was the best of eight possible forms of government 2 12 and would give birth to a new political system : \"the only one worthy of reasonable men.\" 21 3 Only a communist order could bring to an end seduction by money and the attendant corruption and vice. 2 14 Restif's proposed regulations for the human race proposed communal owner­ ship, communal eating, and a new monnaie communismale to replace traditional forms of exchange .2 1 5 As the revolution progressed, Restif intensified his commitment to his communist ideal, which he traced back to his Andrographe of 1782. But it was a lonely vision; and Restif had to print many of his own books in his basement in such small editions that many have been lost. He printed Monsieur Nicolas in an edition of two hundred on pa­ per of such low quality that the book remained largely unknown for nearly a century. 2 16 His Posthumous Letters, also written in 1796, could not be published until 1802; then they were immediately con­ fiscated by the Napoleonic censorship. He compared the ideal communist society of the future with other societies by describing a series of inter­ planetary visits. Appropri ately, in view of his erotic interests and pre­ occupation s, Venus was the site for his communist society of the fu­ ture.

All we know is the one line Restif devoted to \"the birds\" in his Posthumous Letters : Mais le Communisme les retenait dans l'egal ite.217 Others besides Restif disprove the suggestion that there was no \"com­ munism\" in the French Revolution and that the revolutionaries all ac-"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The Objects of Belief cepted the sanctity of private propert y.2 18 Jean-Claude Chappuis, who lived in the same building as Restif during the late 1790s, attacked the Declaration of the Rights of Man for its defense of property rights, anticipating Proudhon by nearly a half a century in labeling property as \"theft.\" 21 9 Another proposal of 1795 argued for la communaute des biens-fonds, communaute d'indus trie and urged the formation of small territorial commu nes.22 o Restif's three-volume Philosophie de Monsieur Nicolas of 1796 called for a commu naute univer selle, and talked about \"the Communists\" as if they were active and numerous in the real world.22 1 The question of whether Restif was alluding to, or in some way connected with, Ba­ beuf's concurrent conspiracy takes us deeper into the occult labyrinths of Paris where modern revolution ary organiz ation began. But it is worth glancing first across the continent to the open spaces of St. Petersburg, where real Communists eventually were to come to power. The first of many Russians to comment substantively on Restif was the founder of a distinct ively Russian tradition of revolutionary intelligentsia: Alex­ ander Radishchev. Writing in his famous Journey from Petersburg to Moscow in the first year of the French Revolution, Radishchev blasted the libertarian excess and sexual permissiveness of Restifs commu­ nism 222-pr oviding a hint of the more ascetic and puritanical version that was to come. The Bonneville Connect ion The possibility of links between Restif's verbal communism and Ba­ beuf's active conspiracy has never been seriously considered-p artly because historians of the revolution have been slow to acknowledge the importance of Restif, but perhaps even more because the paths of investiga tion lead into dark corridors of the human im agination that Western positivists no less than Eastern Marxists prefer to ignore. But before plunging in to explore in all seriousness the occult origins of revolutionary organization, it might be well to summarize such evidence as exists for the possibility of actual links between those seminal figures whom we have found to share so many ideological affinities. While no public suggestion of a link between Babeuf and Restif was raised at the former's public trial, the authoritie s, as they prepared their case, apparently believed that such a link existed.223 Historians now can hardly hope to find more conclusive evidence than the prose­ cutors were able to amass at the time before deciding not to press the connection in court. But Babeuf repeatedly used the word communaute (and inventions like communautiste s) in the revolutionary manner of Restif; 224 and Restif tantalizingly ends Monsieur Nicolas, the magnum opus in which he first set forth his full-blown communist ideal,225 with a reference to Babeuf followed by three dots. He may have been sug­ gesting that the imperatives he provided were flowing into the Babeuvist movement that was just beginning.

Bonnevil le was perhaps Restif's closest friend, seeing him \"almost daily\" in the mid and late 1790s.22 6 Bonneville's most extreme revolu­ tionary associate, Jean-Franc;ois Varlet, lived in the same building as Res­ tif at the time he was beginning his collaboration with Babeuf.227 Bonne­ ville secretly printed Restif's basic communist treatise, Monsieur Nicolas, in his own home along with the follow-up treatise, Le Philoso phie de Monsieur Nicolas, and Varlet's Explosion . 22 s Ba beuf had close knowledge of (if not direct contact with) the Social Circle in 1790, placing the Bouche de Fer at the head of his own list of journals; 229 and in December 1790, signing his name \"Babeuf de la societe de la confederation universelles des amis de la verite.\" 230 He may have had continuing contact with the Confederation in Picardy, where there was special provincial enthusiasm for the Confedera­ tion.231 He could have had personal contact with Bonneville in Paris in December 1790, or again in April 1793, when Marechal suggested that Babeuf take a job as typogra pher for the press of the Social Circle. At that exact time, Marechal was engaged in an intensive program of publication at Bonneville's press; and both of his major works of 1793, Correctif ala revolution and Almanach des republicains, bore the mys­ terious new designation \"a Paris chez les Directeurs de l'Imprimerie du Cercle Social.\" It would appear that Marechal himself was one of the \"directors\" of this press; and that this press, which continued to publish works by Marechal and other Babeuvists, linked in some way Bonne­ ville's circle with Babeuf's conspiracy.2 a 2 Import ant further evidence for suggesting such a link can be found in the neglected pamphlet of Varlet, which appeared in 1792 as the first document to bear the imprimatur of \"the directors of the p ress of the Social Circle.\" His Project for a Special and Impe rative Man­ date to Those Mandated by the People to the National Convention pur­ ported to be \" printed at the expense of sans-culotes [sic]\" and seemed to call for little less than a social revolution. It was a warning of the dang ers of \"legislative tyranny\" in any central assembly within the new republic where \"careerists\" may claim to \"represent \" the people while failing to satisfy their concrete social and economic needs. In order not to betray what Varlet was the first to call \"the second revolu­ tion,\" he bluntly instructed \"those mandated by the People\" : You will cement the social pact .... You will lay the foundation that has so far been neglected of social happine ss. 2 33 Thus Man�chal appears to have derived his concept of a needed sec­ ond, social revolution from his fellow \"director \" of Bonneville's press. Marechal's subsequent participation in the Babeuf conspiracy was kept secret until revealed in Buonarroti's History in 1828, which explained that materials on Marechal's \"definitive legislation of equality\" were hid­ den in a place inaccessible to the police. Any such materials have"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Objects of Belief remained hidden from scholars as well, so the precise nature of Ba­ beuf's links with Marechal and the surviving \"directors\" of the Social Circle cannot be determined. There is strong reason to believe, however, that Babeuf borrowed heav­ ily from the Bonnev ille he had admired in 1789-90 in shaping his own conspiracy in 1795-96.23 4 Babeuf took both the title and function of his key journal from Bonneville's earlier Tribune of the People. He adopted this new name at precisely the point when his journalism assumed the oracular and mobilizing functions Bonneville's journal had claimed for itself during the Parisian insurrection of 1789. Posters to be distributed by the Babeuvists alluded to the precedents of 1789 (rather than 1792) not only to attract a broader base of support but also to suggest an uprising beyond politics of the kind first envisaged in Paris by Bonne­ ville. Babeuf revived Bonneville's favorite fantasy of using trumpets in the streets to make announcements, his stress on social goals and bonheur commun, and his assignment of leadership roles to women .235 Babeuf ma y also have adopted from Bonneville the more general idea of a net­ work of reporters-supporters and of a secret inner circle directing a broader public confederat ion . Bonneville's Social Circle had a far more extensive program than is generally realized during the two years prior to Robespierre's dictator­ ship in the summer of 1793. 2 36 The Social Circle was, moreover, more radical in social policy then than were the rival Jacobins-setting up an agitational organizat ion for wage earners and artisans in 1791, the Point central des arts et metiers,za1 writing pioneering treatises on insurrec­ tion ,za s and calling for equality above all, equ ality between men, equality between the departments, between Paris and the rest of France. 2 39 These militant egalitarian ideals attracted new interest after the fall of the Jacobin dictatorship and the parallel deepening of the economic crisis in Paris. Although the nature and the extent of Bonneville's activ­ ity after Thermidore is still obscure, he became even more closely linked with Restif and Mercier-and remained active and influential until 18oo, when Napoleon shut the last journal of the Social Circle, Le Bien-Informe after Bonneville compared Napoleon to Cromwell. 24 0 Whatever the precise links of Babeuf to Bo nneville , of both with Marechal, and of all with Buonarroti, a common force shaped them all: romant ic occultism.

Those who sought to keep alive the high hopes of the early revolution ary era no longer focused their faith on the ongoing process of innovation in society as a whole, but instead retreated to the secure nucleus of a secret society where intense conviction need not be compromised by the diffuse demands of practical politics. Their myth of the unfinished revolution lent to such secret societies the special aura of an elect anticipating the Second Coming. The mantle of revolutionary legitimacy passed from the rulers of France to small conspiratorial groups throughout Europe. These groups echoed the se­ crecy and utopianism of Bonneville's circle and Babeuf's conspiracy more than the open political activity of the J a co bin clubs and the par­ liamentary assemblies. Moreover, because of the increasing effectiveness of the political po­ li ce, secret societies tended to move even further underground. Thus under Napoleon, conspiratorial societies with hierarchical discipline became the dominant form of revolutionary organization, and in the 182os under the conservative restorat ion they produced a wave of rev­ olution s throughout Europe. Historians have never been able to unravel the tangled threads of this tapestry-and in recent times have largely given up trying.

The plain fact is that by the mid-1810s there were not just one or two but scores of secret revolutionary organizations throughout Eu­ rope-extending even into Latin Americ a and the Middle East. These groups, although largely unconnect ed, internationalized the modern rev­ olution ary tradition and provided the original forum for the general de­ bate in the modern world about the purposes of political power in a post-traditional society. And it was they who in the process of moderni­ zation pioneered a phenomenon by now familiar: impatient youth form­ ing their own organizations to combat monarchical-religious authority. The story of the secret societies can never be fully reconstr ucted, but it has been badly neglected-even avoided, one suspects-bec ause the evidence that is available repeatedly leads us into territory equally uncongenial to modern historians in the East and in the West. In what follows I shall attempt to show that the modern revolution­ ary tradition as it came to be internationalized under Napoleon and the Restorat ion grew out of occult Freemasonry ; that early organiza­ tional ideas originated more from Pythagorean mysticism than from practical experience; and that the real innovators were not so much po­ litical activists as literary intellectuals, on whom German romantic thought in general-and Bavarian Illuminism in particular-exerted great influen ce. Buo narroti : The First Apostle The continuous history of international revolution ary organiz ation be­ gins with a lonely individual in exile, Filippo Giuseppe Maria Lodovico Buonarroti. Largely unknown until in 1828 at the age of sixty-seven he published his History of the Babeuf Conspiracy, thereafter he was the patriarch to a new generation of revolutiona ries until his death in 1837. He is largely remembered today as a kind of Plato to Babeuf's Socrates -recording the teachings and martyrdom of the master for posterity. But he was also the first apostle 2 of a new religion : the first truly to become a full-time revolutionary in the modern sense of having total dedication to the creation by force of a new secular order. Buonarroti, the oldest of five sons of a noble Florentine family, was a direct descendant of Michel angelo. He showed an early aptitude for French and for music: the two languages used by Italians to express hopes higher than those they found in their own vernacular. French was the language of philosophy and progress for the aristocratic En­ lightenment in Tuscany as elsewhere , and music, of course, was the language of longing."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"88 F ouNDATIONS oF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH These languages of rational reform and of lyric hope were important to the young Buonarroti. His family was largely impover ished; by the time he was elected to the noble order of Saint Stephen in 1778, the handsome, seventeen-ye ar-old Florentine had acquired a sense of self­ importance he had no way of sustaining. A poor aristocrat in an eco­ nomically stagnant city, he sought satisfaction in the life of the mind. Thus he became the prototypical radical intellectual : gifted, self-indul­ gent, and restless-wit h a penchant for politics. Buonarroti was directed by his father to the study of law at Pisa,3 and his earliest thoughts about radical social change may have oc­ curred during his first voyage out of Tuscany to Marseilles in the sum­ mer of 1780. He was shocked by his discovery of urban poverty 4- and perhaps also stimulated by the cosmopolitan atmosphere of the French Mediterranean port. Returning to study at Pisa, he fell under the spell of the Italian followers of Rousseau and Morelly who dom­ inated the faculty.5 By late 1786, Buonarroti had chosen the public career characteristic of almost all revolutionar ies: journalism. He founded a short-lived weekly journal in Florence which sought simultaneously to combat religious superstition in Tuscany and to awaken political consciousnes s. Published in French, the language of the Enlightenment, his Journal Politique was conceived \"dans le gout des Gazettes Angloises,\" and ap­ peared at the beginning of I 787 as .. . a collection of the deeds transpiring in the four corners of the World, and above all in Europe, seeking to inspire interest and to make one take note of the march of Nations to their greatness or decadence. 6 By seeking \"to talk politics (politiqu er) with those who shall wish to listen to us,\" 7 Italy would find the path to greatne ss. Buonarroti's journal praised both the new American constitution for its guarantees of religious and journalistic liberty, and the religious battles of the Jansenists and the Dutch republicans against the forces of tradition. 8 During the first days of the French Revolution , Buonarroti enthusias­ tically propagated the new ideas as an editor and bookseller in Leg­ horn, and he was exiled to Corsica early in 1790. In the decade that followed, he refined into modern form the two cent ral myths of the revolution ary tradition: belief in an uncompleted revolution and faith in a perfect alternative rooted in nature. The first myth he esta blished through cultivating the memory of Babeuf and by pioneering a new approach to revolutionary organization. And he re­ fined the myth of nature by carrying it beyond sentimentality into revolution ary practicality. This latter contributio n, unrecognized even among Buonarrotian scholars , began with his stay in Corsica from 1790 to 1792. In these years, the very ones when Babeuf was first formulating his radical \"agrarian law\" in Picardy, Buonarroti discov­ ered an idealized state of nature in rural Corsica (with occasional visits to Sardinia and other neighboring islands ). 9 His Patriotic ] ournal of Corsica in 1790 10 defended the French Revolution in Rousseauian terms, arguing that \"general happiness\" can be found only \"in the state of"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The Occult Origins of Organization 8g nature\" where alone we realize \"the faculty of acting according to the determination of our will.\" 11 His baptism by fire occurred during the Corsican years when he joined the campaign of revolutionary France against Sardinia in 1792. He became a propagandist-legislator for the only successful part of the expedit ion: the occupation of the small Island of San Pietro. Describing his function in that idyllic spot as \"teaching the sweet doctrine of nature,\" 12 he drafted for it a model republican constitution, which he called The Code of Nature. Faced with the general failure of the Sardinian expedition, Buonarroti left for Paris late in 1792. He had been one of the foreigners designated as citizens of the First French Republic. On April 29, 1793, Buonarroti argued successfully before the Convention in Paris for the incorporation of his island utopia into the French Republic under the new name of Isola della Liberta, the Island of Liberty .IB Buonarroti's first arrival in Paris began a life-long infatuation. The revolutionary city seemed to him magically able to lift people out of their private pettiness into shared enthusiasm : I admired that metamorphosis by which long dominant personal interests were fused into a common interest that became the passion of all .14 He saw the main thing to fear as betrayal from within. In the only treatise that Buonarroti wrote during his first stay in Paris, The Corsican Conspiracy Entirely Unmasked, he warned the French people against creeping count er-revolution by \"rich egoists\" who were in fact \"enemies of equality.\" 1 5 \"Great treasons\" arise from those who lacked \"holy en­ thusiasm\" for creating a new type of community. This pamphlet of 17 94 was a savage denunciation of the alleged betrayal of the Corsican revolution by its supposed leader and hero General Paoli. Having led the original rebellion against Genoese tyranny, Paoli had returned to Corsica after a long exile and allied himself with the English in oppos­ ing the French-supported republ icans. Paoli symbolized the revolutionary­ turned-opportunis t. Buonar roti denounced him as a type, and called for a new sort of man to complete the revolution. To prevent future Paoli's in France, he suggested-in a passage prophetic of future revolutionary history-that there was a \"great need for a great purge.\" 1 G As the Reign of Terror descended on Paris, Buonarroti moved back onto the front lines of revolutionary advance into Italy. He joined Robespierre's younger brother Augustine and the young Napoleon Bon­ aparte with the French armies on the Italian Riviera early in 1794. On April 9, Buonarroti took charge of revolutionary rule in the Ligurian city of Oneglia. He began the \"organization of the peace\" by setting up a centralized system of \"revolutionary agents\" designed to mobilize the population against \"agents of tyranny\" still serving the Italian aristocracy and priestho od.l 7 Buonarroti's proclamation of May 9 to the people of Oneglia may be considered the first statement of his apocalyptical egalitarianism.

He incessantly used the term sans culottes, and affected penury by insisting when he was arrested that he possessed only one suit of clothes : I have never attached myself to any powerful person. I have always lived modestly, sometimes in poverty .... No one would dare say that I ha ve ever loved money . .. 1 9 Until the end of his days, he kept with him as a kind of talisman the certificate indicating that he had been admitted to La Societa Popola re \"after having undergone a purifying scrutiny.\" 2 o After helping to set up a new system of public instruction and a local Festival of the Supreme Being and of Nature, Buonarroti was arrested on March 5, 1795. In the Paris courtroom he defended his use of terror in Oneglia against \"the enemies and emigres that infested us,\" but stressed the pedagogic nature of his rule: . . . my manner of terrifying consisted in preaching our principles and interests to the inhabitants; in placing in their hands proclamations and books in their language in a familiar and intelligible style ... 21 In his successful defense he insisted that he \"never belonged to any party.\" 22 He anticip ated the authentic revolutionary posture of pur­ porting to serve a universal cause beyond the petty, quarreling factions of the moment. By 1796, Buonarroti had moved away entirely from his sentimental understanding of nature to a revolutionary concept of law and obligat ion. The law of nature differs esse ntially from what is called the state of nature. The first is the result of experience and reflection ; the second, of first impressions and ignorance. 2 3 He henceforth sought \"to lead men back to nature\" 2 4 not by following the mossy path \"of the native living alone in the forests,\" 2 5 but by creating an egalitarian community in Paris itself. After his acquittal in 1795, Buonarroti joined the Babeuf conspiracy in an effort to realize \"this sweet community.\" 26 He was rearrested with Babeuf and the other conspirators in 1797, imprisoned in Cherbour g, then sent to the Island of Re under close scrutiny before being permitted by Napoleon to move to Geneva in July 1806. 2 1 Buonarroti remained in Geneva for the next seventeen years except for fourteen months he spent in Grenoble during 1813-14. He became the first in a long line of revolutio naries-culmin ating in Lenin-to use Switzerl and, \"the land of Jean-Jacques\" as he called it, 28 as a secure mounting base for revolutionary activity.

Neither organization appears to have had much substance, but Buonarroti's unremitting efforts in­ spired and at times guided the resistance to Napoleon. Some of his fel­ low Babeuvists were active in the intrigues of the Philadelphians, which culminated in the first serious republican attempt to overthrow Na­ poleon, led by General Claude-Franc;ois Malet in r8o8, and Buonarroti had direct contacts with the second, more formidable conspiracy of Malet in r8r 2.2il Buonarroti's role was even greater in the revolution ary conspiracies that proliferated during the Restoration following the final defeat of Bonaparte. Though Buonarroti never succeeded in formally enlisting many fol­ lowers, his ideas influenced many young soldiers and students who had been politically awakened by the Napoleonic wars. Indeed, Buonarroti brought a certain Napoleonic quality to his own plans for revolution. Like Bonaparte, he had begun his political career as an obscure Franco­ Italian on the Island of Corsica; and had been an early agent of French revolution ary expansion into Italy. At the end, on St. Helena, Napoleon paid grudging tribute to his revolutionary nemesis : He could have been very useful to me in organizing the Kingdom of Italy. He could have been a very good profe ssor. He was a man of extra­ ordinary talent : a descendant of Michelangelo, an Italian poet like Ariosto, writing French better than I, des igning like David, playing the piano like Paesiello.3 0 Buonar roti did not, however, return the compliment. He wrote Ba­ beuf's son that Bonapa rte \"delivered the coup de grace to the revolu­ tion.\" 3 1 As he and his contemporaries struggled to keep revolutionary dedication alive under Napoleon, Buonarroti became ever more deeply imbued with romantic occultism. This very tendency to the occult owed, paradoxically, a good deal to Napoleon. Since Napoleon claimed to embody the Enlightenment, his revolution ary opposition cultivated anti­ Enlightenment ideas. Since Napoleon posed as the be arer of universal rationalism-openly imposing the Code Napoleon, the metric system, and French administrative methods wherever he went-his opponents secretly fled to exotic fraternal organizations to nurse their protest. Since, moreover, Napoleon's opposition included extreme monarchists as well as extreme republ icans, concepts of the Right often filtered into the programs of the Left. The Masonic lodges of Geneva provided the ambiance in which Buon­ arroti formulated in r8II his first full blueprint for a new society of revolutionary republi cans: the Sublime Perfect Masters.3 2 Both the so­ ciety's name and the three levels of membership proposed for it had been adopted from Masonry. Indeed, Buonarroti sought to work through existing Masonic lodges: to recruit through them, influence them, use them as a cover, and (if necessary) even undermine them. His final aim was the original Babeuvist one of putting into effect on a continental scale the revolutionary republican Constitution of 1793.33 His colorful blueprint for doing so-rich in Masonic symbolism -pro-"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"F ouNDATIONs oF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH vided the prototype for modern revolutionary organization. The society was secret and hierarchic al. Only those in the inner circle were told that the organization sought radical social change as well as a republi­ can constitution. Elaborate precautions of secrecy were increasingly taken. Printed forms signifying the grade of membership were to be burned-or if necessary swallowed-in case of detainment or danger. Buonarroti's organization called for a morality of its own; a kind of moral Manicheanism within the revolutionary elect. They were the agents of good against evil, freedom against tyranny, equality versus egoism. His inner circle, the \"great firmament\" of Nature, was a political authority clearly superior to Napoleon, let alone other petty princelings. The Milieu of Freemas onry Although Buonarroti's revolution ary organization went far beyond any Masonic models, it was clearly influenced by his five-year immersion in Masonic meetings in Geneva. So great, indeed, was the general impact of Freemasonry in the revolutiona ry era that some understanding of the Masonic milieu seems the essential starting point for any serious inquiry into the occult roots of the revolution ary tradition. Masonry imparted to the revolution ary tradition at birth the essential metaphor that revolutionaries used to understand their own mission down to the mid-nineteenth century : that of an architect building a new and better structure for human society. Masons believed they were recreating in their fraternal societies the \"natural\" condition of cooper­ ation that prevailed among those earlier, artisan masons who shaped stones for a common building. The progression of each \"brother\" from the stage of apprentice through journeyman to master required philosophical and philan­ thropic accomplishment rather than social status. \"Free\" masonry was, thus, a moral meritocracy-implicitly subversive within any static so­ ciety based on a traditional hierarchy. Men of intelligence and ambition in the eighteenth century often experienced within Masonic lodges a kind of brotherhood among equals not to be found in the aristocratic society outside. The rituals leading to each new level of membe rship were not, as is sometimes suggested, childish initiations. They were awesome rites of passage into new types of association, promising access to higher truths of Nature once the blindfold was removed in the inner room of the lodge. Each novice sought to become a \"free\" and \"perfected\" Mason capable of reading the plans of the \"Divine Architect\" for \"rebuilding the temple of Solomon,\" and reshaping the secular order with moral force. Masonry ritualized fraternity and provided upward mobility more eas­ ily than outside society. The Masonic title of \"brother\" fulfilled on the continent some of the function of blending bourgeoisie and aristocracy that was assumed in England by the envied term \"gentleman .\" 3 4 In the Masonic milieu, normally conservative people could seriously enter-"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The Occult Origins of Organization 93 tain the possibility of Utopia 35-or at least of a social alternative to the ancien regime. Philip of Orleans was the titular head of French Ma­ sonry (the Grand Orient); and most of the pro-revolutionary denizens of the cafes of the Palais-Royal were his Masonic \"brothe rs.\" In the early days of the revolution, Masonry provided much of the key symbolism and ritual-beginning with the Masonic welcome under a \"vault of swords\" of the king at the Hotel de Ville three days after the fall of the Bastille.3 6 To be sure, most French Masons prior to the revolution had been \"not revolutionaries , not even reformers, nor even discontent\" ; 37 and, even during the revolution, Masonry as such re­ mained politically polymorph ous: \"Each social element and each politi­ cal tendency could 'go masonic' as it wished.\" ss But Masonry pro­ vided a rich and relatively nontraditional foraging ground for new national symbols (coins, songs, banners, seals), new forms of address (tu, frere, vivat!), and new models for civic organizati ons, particularly outside Paris. s9 Most important for our story, Masonry was deliberately used by revolu­ tionaries in the early nineteenth century as a model and a recruiting ground for their first conspiratorial experiments in political organiza­ tion. Buonarroti was entirely typical in adopting the names of two Masonic lodges, \"perfect equality\" and \"perfect union,\" for his first two revolutionary clusters in Geneva. These lodges had originated in the 176os in opposition to absolute monarchy and aristocratic priv­ ilege respectively.4 o Buonarroti drew up his first blueprint for \"the sublime perfect masters\" during his active membership of I8o6-I3 in a lodge of \"perfect equality\" in Geneva,4 1 and defined \"perfect equal­ ity\" as its goal. The lodges of \"perfect union\" left their impact on the revolutionary organizat ion Union founded in I813-14 in Grenoble dur­ ing Buon arroti's visit there by his future collaborator Joseph Rey. The Illuminist Model If Freemasonry provided a general milieu and symbolic vocabulary for revolutionary organization , it was Illuminism that provided its basic structural model. The organizational plan that Buon arroti distilled from two decades of revolutionary experience in Geneva (and basically re­ mained faithful to for the rest of his life) was simply lifted from the Bavarian Order of Illumin ists. This radical and secular occultist move­ ment was organized on three levels in a secret hierarchy: church, sy­ nod, and areopagite. Buonarroti's revolutionary version of this struc­ ture defined the \"church\" as the local cell headed by a \"sage,\" who was alone linked with the regional \"synod.\" The members of each synod (\"the sublime elect\") were headed by a \"territorial deacon,\" who super­ vised the activities of all \"churches\" in the region. The highest \"areo­ pagite\" grade (also called \"the Great Firmament\" ) sent out its own \"mo­ bile deacons\" to control the synods and supervise propaganda and agitation . 42 It may be well to trace in some deta il the nature and impact of this"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"9 4 F ouNDATIONS oF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH baffling movement, because its influence was far from negligible and has been as neglected in recent times as it was exaggerated in an earlier era. The Order of Illuminists was founded on May I, 1776, by a professor of canon law at the University of Ingolstadt in Bavaria, Adam Weis­ haupt, and four associates. The order was secret and hierarch ical, modeled on the Jesuits (whose long domination of Bavarian education ended with their abolition by the Papacy in 1773) and dedicated to Weishaupt's Rousseauian vision of leading all humanity to a new moral perfection freed from all established religious and political authority. Weishaupt did not so much invite intellectuals to join his new peda­ gogic elite as taunt them to do so . He radiated contempt for men of the Enlightenment who \"go into ecstacies over antiquity, but are them­ selves unable to do anything,\" H and insisted that \"what is missing is the force to put into practice what has long been affirmed by our minds.\" 44 That force was to come from an altogether new type of secret so­ ciety, which would have \"much more the characteristics of a militia in action than an order with initiati ons.\" 4 5 The purpose of ascending the Illuminist hierarchy was not so much to attain wisdom as to be remade into a totally loyal servant of a universal mission. \"We can­ not use people as they are, but begin by making them over.\" 46 Weis­ haupt's elaborate process of recruitment involved creating in the nov­ ices a psychological dependence on the process that was transforming them. \"Insinuators\" (those who brought in new members ) were to pro­ ceed \"little by little following detours\" : ... giving birth first to imprecise and vague desires, then, when the can­ didate himself experiences them, show him the object that he will then seize upon with his own two hands.47 The \"object\" was the card pledging the new member's desire for admission to the next higher level of the order. At this point of eager­ ness, the \"insinuator\" became the \"superior,\" and made it difficult for the newcomer to enter into the next circle. The \"postulant\" might in­ deed have to face intense scrutiny during a two-year \"novitiate\" and a thirty-page questionnaire asking him about everything from his taste in clothes to his position of sleeping in bed. This nerve-wracking pro­ cess sought to mobilize a new elite whose purpose was ... neither to conquer territories nor to impose authority, nor to gather riches ... [but] the more difficult conquest of individuals. Their indiffer­ ence, passive or obedient submission is not enough. Their total confidence without reservation, their enthusiasm, must be gained.48 The revolutionaries' primitive vision of the world as a dualistic strug­ gle between the forces of darkness and of light may originate in the neo-Manichaean view of Weishaupt's followers that their elect group of \"illuminated ones\" was engaged in struggle with \"the sons of darkne ss,\" their categorical name for all outside the order. The name for the order was initially uncertain (Perfectibilists was used and Bees consid-"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"The Occult Origins of Organization 95 ered); 49 but the name Illuminist was apparently chosen from the im­ age of a sun radiating illumination to outer circles. At the very center within the inner circle of Areopagites burned a candle symbolizing the solar source of all illumin ation. The Zoroastrian-Ma nichaean cult of fire was central to the otherwise eclectic symbolism of the Illuminists; their calendar was based on Persian rather than classical or Christian models .5 0 Pseudonyms and symbol s, which had precise esoteric significance in Masonic lodges, became deliberate instruments of camouflage for the Illuminists. Ingolstadt was both Eleusis and Ephesus ; Munich was Ath­ ens; Vienna, Rome. Weishaupt's own Illuminist name of Spartacus, the leader of a slave revolt in ancient Rome, provided a hint of revolu­ tionary commitme nt; but his original key collaborators took the names of the Greek Ajax and the Egyptian Danaus respectively, and other names ranged from Tamerlane to Confucius. 5 1 The Illuminists attempted to use the ferment and confusion in Free­ masonry for their own ends. Weishaupt joined a Masonic lodge in Munich in 1777; and attempted to recruit \"commandos\" (groups of followe rs) from within the lodges of the Bavarian capital. Late in I 780, Weishaupt's campaign spread to all of Germany and to the pseudo­ knightly higher orders of Masonry with the entrance into Weishaupt's inner circle of Baron Adolph Knigge. He was a native of Hanover and a leader of occultism in Frankfurt, which soon replaced Munich as the leading \"colony\" of the movement. For five intensive years (until Knigge left the order in July 1785), the Illuminists recruited largely among those who had belonged to the most popular of the German higher Masonic orders, the Strict Observance. The Illuminist technique was, first of all, to discredit the more conservative rival order by fair means (helping the conference of occult orders at Wilhelmsbad in 1782 to determine that the Strict Observance Lodges were not in fact descended from the Knights-Te mplars ) and foul (arguing that the Strict Obser­ vance Lodges were secretly controlled by \"unknown superiors\" who were in fact Jesuits in disguise ).52 The Illuminists coopted the organizational structure of their conser­ vative Masonic rival; in the process, they acquired some of the myster­ ious allure that they had not possessed as an arid cult of rationalistic intellectuals. Illuminism also became much more political. Weishaupt appears to have initially seen Masonry as a kind of inter­ mediate training ground for Illuminists- after they had entered the order but before they joined the secret inner circles.\"3 Then, under Knigge's guidance, he developed a system of three successive \"classes\" that in­ corporated all existing \"grades\" of Masonry as prelimin ary to a higher class of Illuminist grades. The first two classes (the prepara tory and the middle) incorporated the three traditional grades and the higher sym­ bolic grades of Masonry respectively. The third or \"administrative\" class was the most original-and indi­ cated by its very name the political implications of Weishaupt's plan for the moral renovation of humanity. Its first two grades, those of \"small secrets\" and \"great secrets\" respectively, led up to the third and"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"g6 F ouNDATioNs OF THE R EVOLUTIONAHY F AITH highest grade: the Areopagites, where all the ultimately irrelevant sym­ bols were discarded for the pure reign of natural liberty and equality. Within this final grade-tota lly secret from all others-the \"ennobling of motives\" 54 was complete, the social contract was restored, and a new \"inner politics\" would provide both the nucleus and the model for a transformed world. These divisions within the Illuminist hierarchy were popularly described in ecclesiastical terms. The first two classes encompassing all past Masonic stages were the \"C h urch\"; the first two grades of the administrative class, the \"Synod\" ; and the final, Areopa­ gite stage represented man freed from all authority to live in egalitar­ ian harmony. This promise of total liberation terrified the German-speaking world, and the order was subjected to ridicule, persecution, and formal dis­ solution during 1785-87. Weishaupt was banished to Gotha and kept under survei llance. But the diaspora of an order that had reached a membership of perhaps two thousand five hundred 55 at its height in the early 178os led to a posthumous impact that was far greater throughout Europe than anything the order had been able to accom­ plish during its brief life as a movement of German intellectua ls. In France, the publicat ion by the Bavarian police of Weishaupt's corres­ pondence and other documents in 1787 created more fascination than fear. The Essay on the Sect of Illumi nists, published the following year by the brother of a former function ary of the Prussian court, intrigued rather than horrified. Even the erotic imagination of the Palais-Royal could not have improved on the description of an alleged Illuminist initiation : Marks were made with blood on the prostrate nude body of the candidate. His testicles were bound by a pink and poppy-colored cordon; and he renounced all other human allegiances before five white­ hooded phantoms with bloody banners after a \"colossal figure\" ap­ peared through a fire. Finally, the bands and marks were removed, and he was accepted into the higher order by drinking blood before seven black candles .56 The decisive book in popula rizing the Illuminist ideal was Count Mirabeau's The Prussian Monarchy under Frederick the Great, which also appeared in 1788. Written in large part by a former Illuminist, Jakob Mauvillon, Mirabeau's work distinguished rationalistic Illumi­ nists from \"mystical\" occultists, hailing the former as leaders of a move­ ment the \"great aim\" of which was \"the improvement of the present system of governments and legislations.\" 5 7 Mirabeau took much of his new, totalistic concept of \"the revolution\" directly from Illuminist mod­ els; he almost certainly transmitted something of this ideal to his in­ fluential proteges, Camille Desmoulins and Etienne Dumont (the friend and protector of Thomas Paine in London ), who served successively as his personal secretary. Nicholas Bonneville was, however, the decisive channel of Illuminist influenc e. He was converted to Illuminist ideas during the first of two visits to Paris (in June 1787) by Weishaupt's leading associate in the final political stage of Illuminism, Christian Bode. A friend of Lessing who had come to win Frenchmen away from their own drift into con-"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The Occul t Origins of Organization 97 servative occultism, Bode apparently converted the German-speaking Bonneville (then working as a lawyer for the Parlement ) to a faith that combined Illuminist symbols and radical ideas of popular sover­ eignty.5 8 Bonneville immediately began his unsuccessful attempt to convert Condorcet to the more active faith, hailing the imminent com­ ing of \"the People-K ing,\" the liberating \"flame of the world\" foreseen by the \"sage\" Rousseau.\"9 Bonneville saw popular liberation as a kind of blindfolded mass entry into an Illuminist sanctuary : Take away from the people the bandage that covers their eyes .... Place the hand of the People on the veil ... it will soon be torn aside. G o Accused by contempora ries of making \"the title of Citizen a grade of Illumini sm,\" 6 1 Bonneville argued in Illuminist terms that \"the integral man is God,\" and that from the center of the social circle there will ... emanate a circle of light which will uncover for us that which is hidden in the symbolic chaos of masonic innovations. 5 2 In his massive study of 1788, The Jesuits Driven from Free Masonry, Bonneville developed the basic idea of Weishaupt and Bode that Ma­ sonry had been infiltrated by Jesuits, who had to be driven out by some new order opposed to tyrants and priests. Bonneville's version of the Illuminist ideal interested figures as widely removed as Saint-Just and Desmoulins in Picardy and Dietrich and Schneider in Strasbourg. 6 : 1 The substantial German influx into Paris itself included former Illumi­ nists like the Saxon physician of Philip of Orleans, Jean-Geoffrey Saif­ fert, the Frey brothers, and the journalist Rebma nn.64 Occult-po ssibly Illuminist-influence is detectable in Babeuf's first clear statement of his communist objectives early in 1795-inviting a friend to \"enter into the sacred mysteries of agrarianism\" and accepting fidelity from a chevalier de l'ordre des egaux. 6 5 Babeuf's subsequent first outline for his conspiracy spoke of a \"circle of adherents\" \"advancing by degree\" from les pays limotrophes to transform the wor ld.66 Babeuf's secret, hierarchical organization resembled that of the Illuminists and of Bon­ neville. The strange absence of references by Babeuf and the others to the man who formulated their ultimate objectives, Sylvain Marechal , could be explained by the existence of an Illuminist-type secrecy about the workings of the inner group.67 The conspirators may have viewed Marechal as the \"flame\" at the center of the \"circle.\" As such, he would have had to be protected by the outer circle against disclosure to pro­ fane outsiders. His mysterious designation of Paris as \"Atheopolis\" and himself as l'HSD ( l'homme sans dieu) represented precisely the ideal of Weishaupt's inner Areopagites: man made perfect as a god-without-G od. As for Buonar roti (who codified the legend of Babeuf and first revealed Marechal's role), he had been fascinated with Illuminism even before the revolution. Already in 1787, he drew ideas from Mirabeau and noted the struggle of Illuminism with Catholicism in Bavaria.68 A hint that Buonarroti may even have been committed to Illuminism is provided in"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"g8 F ouNDATIONS oF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH a forgotten journal of 1789 by a group of young Italians who had been influenced by Illuminism while studying in Bavaria. Excited by the political news from France, these students drew up plans in Innsbruck (\"Samos\" ) to set up a journal capable of promoting the total transfor­ mation of humanity set forth in the Illuminist ideal. Late in 1789, they published in Sondrio, on the Italian side of the Alps, a journal that may well have been the first ideological revolutionary organ of modern tim es: Political Appendix to all the gazettes and other news sheets .... The journal purported to move beyond politics, by providing a kind of pedagog ic guide for the revolution ary reading of all other publications. The editors insisted: The Appendix is not a gazette, but rather a reasoned course of Legisla­ tion, of Government, of Political Economy, applied to the present revolu­ tions of Europe.G 9 Its ideal was \"happy equality\" 70 as \"preached by the citizen of Ge­ neva\" 7 1 and embodied in a \"social constitution .\" 7 2 This ideal clearly went beyond the purely political reading of Rousseau favored among French politicians of the revolution ary era. The more radical social ideal had released on Europe \"the energy of the winds, which are bursting forth violently against oppression .\" 73 The first issue praised the Weishaup t-Mirab eau concept of a \"revolu­ tion of the mind\" as the proper objective of the \"century of the illumi­ nated.\" 74 It identified this type of revolution with the Bavarian Illumi­ nists (\"the company which Count Mirabeau has compared to the Priests of Eleusis\" ) ,7\" and distinguished their ideal from spiritualist distor­ tions. The editor followed the Illuminist practice of adopting a preten­ tious pseudonym, \"Lazzaro Jona\" (suggesting perhaps Lazarus, Jonah, and the return of truth from death), and hailed as a friend \"Abraham Levi Salomon,\" the \"recorder\" ( estensore ) of the Patriotic Journal of Corsica. 7 6 A footnote identified this figure as \"the cavalier Buonarroti,\" a \"man of spirit.\" 77 Since Buonar roti is the only contempo rary Italian mentioned by name in the journal, Buonarroti would seem to have had some special connect ion with the Appendix as well as with the Patriotic Journal, \"the first revolutionary journal in Italian,\" 7 8 which he launched soon after being banished to Corsica in October 1789. Cer­ tainly there is stylistic and substantive continuity between Buonarroti's Journal Politique of 1787 and the short-lived Appendix and Patriotic Journal. The second and final number of the Appendix spoke of a forth­ coming special issue that would provide \"a political course on the Rev­ olution in France and the affairs of the other powers.\" 79 But this issue never appeared, and Buonarroti soon immersed himself in revolution ary activity within France. Gioacchino Prati, a young student from Trentino who later became one of Buonarroti's closest collaborators, traced the Illuminist connec­ tion when he contended that Buonarroti's first revolution ary organiza­ tion, the Sublime Perfect Masters, \"was instituted during the first French Revolution \" and was \"composed of four concen tric circles\"­ each with its own secret profession of faith. so The outer circle was"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The Occult Origins of Organization ---- ------- ---- 99 designed to attract \"the large mass of Liberals, who, like the Radicals, strive for universal suffrage and popular instituti ons.\" Inside was a secret, second circle composed of \"staunch democ rats.\" The final, inner circle was unknown to the others and pledged to absolute egalitarianism . Whether or not Buonarroti was in effect propagating an Illuminist program during his revolutionary activity of the 17gos, he had clearly internalized a number of Illuminist ideas well before the massive bor­ rowing in his revolutionary blueprint of I 810-1 I. He had adopted the Illuminist pretension of recovering a natural religion known only to \"Illuminated\" sects in the past. He saw himself as \"reintegrating\" \"in its ancient forms the religion of nature, reason\" 81 by reviving the legacy of a bizarre genealogy : \"the Persians of Cyrus, the initiators of Egyptian priests, the holy Hermandad of Spain, the apostolate of Jesus, t he Anabaptists, and above all the Jesuit order.\" 8 2 He followed Weishaupt and Bonneville in attaching special importance to the Jesuits, whom he sought both to imitate and to liquid ate. His secret ideal was from the beginning, according to Prati, the egalitarian Illuminist one of breaking down all \"marks of private property.\" Let the Republic be the sole proprietor; like a mother, it will afford to each of its members equal education, food and labour. This is the only regeneration ai med at by philosophers. This is the only rebuilding of Jerusalem . .. ,83 Such borrowings from Illuminism seem substantial enough to chal­ lenge the long-accepted judgment of the leading student of the subject that, after 1790, Illuminism \"having disappeared from history ... lived on only in legend.\" 84 There seems good reason to believe that Illumi­ nist influence was not so much a \"legend\" as an imperfectly perceived reality. 8 5 The same historian's perplexed observation that \"the police legend\" about Illuminists began to \"develop with more amplitude and originality\" in the Napoleonic era 8 6 points to a surprising source of Illuminist influence. Illuminist ideas influenced revolutionaries not just through left-wing propone nts, but also through right-wing oppone nts. As the fears of the Right became the fascination of the Left, Illuminism gained a paradoxical posthumous influence far greater than it had exer­ cised as a living movement. The Pythagorean Passion As we have seen, a vast array of labels and images was taken from classi­ cal ant iq u it y to legitimize the new revolution ary faith. Two r ela tive ly neglected names were central to the development of an ideal identity among revolutionary intellect uals: the image of the revolutionary as a"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"100 F ouNDATIONS oF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH modern Pythagoras and of his social ideal as Philadelphi a. These two labels illustrated the proto-romantic reaching for a distant Greek ideal as a lofty alternative to the Roman images of power and conquest that had dominated France as it moved like ancient Rome from republic to empire under Napoleon. Pythagoras and Philadelphia represented a kind of distillation of the high fraternal ideals common both to the oc­ cult brotherhoods of Masonry and Illuminism and to the idealistic youthful mobilization to defend the revolution in 1792- 94. The two labels recur like leitmotifs amidst the cacophony of shifting ideals and groups during the r ecession of revolutiona ry hopes at the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth. Precisely during this dark period the modern revolutionary tradition was born-echoing the romantic Napoleonic belief that all things were possible, but looking for a lost Hellenic ideal r ather than to the recov­ ered Roman empire of the new Caesar. Pythagor as, the semi-legendary Greek philosopher, provided a model for the intellectua l-turned-revo lutionary. He became a kind of patron saint for romantic revolutionar ies, who needed new symbols of secular sanctity. According t o tradition, the great geometrician of antiquity was driven from Samos, Greece, in the sixth century B.c. to Crotona in Southern Italy, where he allegedly founded a religious-philosophical brotherhood to transform society. Radical intellectual reformers throughout an ­ tiquity periodically revived and embellished this tradition. Neo­ Pythagoreans flourished in Alexandria in the second century B.C.; and a later group of Pythagoreans produced Apollonius of Tyana in the first century A.D., a wonder-working sage who was in his time a major rival to Christ. Though organized movements faded away, Pythagorean ideas recurred in medieval Christianity, which for a time represented Pythagoras as a hidden Jewish link between Moses and Plato. An undercurrent of fascination with Pythagorean thought in the High Renaissance and Enlightenment came to the surface during the French Revolution . Weishaupt's final blueprint for politicized Illuminism, writ­ ten during the first year of the French Revolution , was entitled Pythag­ oras; and, as extremists sought some simple yet solid principles on which to rebuild society, they increasingly turned for guidance to Pythagorean beliefs in prime numbers and geomet ric forms. Early, romantic revolutionaries sought occult shortcuts to the inner truths of nature, and repeatedly attached importance to the central prime num­ bers of Pythagorean mystici sm: r, 3, 7, and above all 5· Pamphleteers of the Right suggested that prime numbers provided a secret organiza­ tional code for revolutionar ies; one particularly ingenious effort of 1797 derived the entire structure of revolutionary history from the number 17. Bonneville had begun the fad on the Left, suggesting even before the revolution that the number 17 held the key to understanding the Jesuits' secret take-over of Masonry. R 7 However bizarre it may appear to later revolution aries and historians alike, this Pythagorean passion seriously influenced the organizational activities of the first revolutionar ies. We have seen how the Illuminists"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"The Occult Origins of Organization 101 made the first halting efforts systematically to use the forms of occult Masonry for ulterior conspiracy-pointing the way for Bonneville, Buonarroti, and the early professional revolutionar ies. But the wild profusion of exotic symbols and higher orders also fed a much broader and more open impulse : the search for simple forms of nature to serve as a touchstone for truth amidst the crumbling authority of tradition. The increasingly manic search for simple, geometric harmonies within Masonry in the I 770s and I 78os reveals the radical thirst for revolu­ tionary simplification at its purest. This quest for legitimizing simplicity spilled out of closed lodges into open assemblies in I78o. Occultists became politicians, and made spe­ cial use of the two most important Pythagorean geometric symbols­ the circle and the triangle-in dramatizing their challenge to estab­ lished power. These two forms became symbols of divinity in medieval Christianity. 88 They increasingly dominated the hieroglyphics of the higher Masonic orders 89-and the imagination of prerevolutionary utopian architects who often sought to build only with \"geometric figures from the triangle to the circle.\" !J o Since many early leaders of the revolution saw themselves as mason-archit ects, they felt some affinity with this ongoing campaign to combat the aristocratic rococo style with the \"rule of geometry.\" Reassured by Newton's law of gravity about the circular harmony of the universe, they felt that man's mastery of mathematical laws made him \"possessor of the secret of the solar universe\" destined to organize human society rationally.9 1 At the same time, the proto-romantic philosophy of German occultism inspired many to see man not as a cog but as a dynamic \"living point destined to become a circle\" n 2 with a \"field of vision comparable to a circle whose circumference grows without end.\" 9 3 But before borders could expand, monuments had to be built in the center. The architectural plans for Paris during the early months of the revolution reveal a special fascination with the three-dimensional forms of the triangle and circle: the pyramid a nd the sphere. Two of the most important monuments proposed in I79I-to the glory of the French nation on the Bastille and to the memory of Mirabeau-were inde­ pendently designed as giant pyramids.94 The pyramid form became even more popular after Napoleon's return from Egypt, though it was soon superseded in public places by the more elongated obelisk. Even before the revolution, utopian architects had felt drawn to \"the sublime magnificence of the sphere.\" The pure form reappeared in the sketch for a Newton Memorial (a sphere with nothing inside except a small grave lit from a single beam of sunlight), a necropolis for the revolution (an empty globe in the middle of a cemete ry), and a proposed Temple of Equality (a huge sphere on columns containing a smaller sphere inside ).95 The Circle The later Pythagoreans had been the first school of classical antiquity systema tically to contend that the earth and universe were spherical in"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"10 2 F ouNDATIONS oF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH shape and finite in form. Numbers and music expressed the hidden harmonies of an ultimately spherical natural perfection. The central reality of human life was the transmig ration of human souls from one body to another-all moving in cycles like the universe itself. Eighteent h-century Pythagoreans were specially excited by the Illumi­ nist idea of progressive human purification from the lower cycles of animal nature to the heavenly spheres of pure intelligence. The Illuminists' hierarchy of circles-mo ving inward from \"church\" to \"synod\" to the Areopagite center-suggested the concentric circles in the universe itself. The flame at the center of the final, inner circle was assumed to be an image of the inner fire of the universe around which the earth and all planets revolved. Occultists may not have always believed in such images literally, but they did usually feel that some secret inner circle held out the promise of both personal redemption and cosmic understanding. Added to this traditional belief in an esoteric higher wisdom was the new promise of German romanticism for liberati on. The concept of a charmed inner circle gave a spatial dimension to the romantic longing for liberty. The life of \"the circle\" was one of liberation-freeing oneself even from bodily limitations for life in the heavenly spheres, freeing society from the constraints of inherited tradition . Weishaupt appears to have been the first to use the term \"circle\" to designate a new type of political organization making both individual moral demands and universal ideological claims. Weishaupt described his recruitment of Illuminists from within Masonic lodges in Munich as \"the progress of the 8\" in the political area. He introduced italicized variants of the Latin word ( circul, circl) into his German writings to explain the politicization of the movement, which he propagated by means of \"circulars\" and \"circulation .\" 9 6 The idea of circles was central to the caricature of Illuminism by Marquis de Luchet no less than to Bonneville's imitation of it. In two key chapters of his expose, Luchet described the \"circle\" as the key nine­ man cell of conspira cy: the \"administrative committee\" for an altogether new type of human society in which \"each member of a circle belongs equally to all the others\" and \"has broken all the links which attach him to society.\" 97 The conservative Rosicrucians who dominated the Prus­ sian court after the accession of Frederick William II in I 786, created their own rival conception of a nine-man Zirkel. Propagators of the Illuminist ideal variously tried to attack the Rosicrucian \"circles of cor­ ruption\" 9 8 and/or to incorporate them into their own plans for occult \"circulation .\" 99 We have already seen how Bonneville envisaged a global transforma­ tion on the Illuminist model through \"magic circles\" radiating the ideas of his central \"social circle\" out to the entire CERCLE DU PEUPLE FRANC. With the recession of revolutionary expectations in the late I 790s, Bonneville (and his associates like Thomas Paine and Sylvain Marechal ) clung-like Weishaupt in exile before them-to the image of oneself as Pythagor as: an exiled but \"relevant\" intellectual building a new brotherhood of deliverance for the future."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The Occult Origins of Organization 10 3 Bonneville even before the revolution had traced the Illuminist ideal to Pythagoras, who \"brought from the orient his system of true Ma­ sonic instruction to illumin ate the occident.\" 1 00 Mter the demise of his effort to \"squ are the social circle\" 101 via his organizations of the early 1790s, Bonneville wrote verses on \"the numbers of Pythagoras,\" 10 2 pro­ cla iming that \"man is God\" and will \"become angelic\" by widening the circle of universal brotherh ood : 0 Cercle Social! Espoir toujours plus doux, d'un pacte general; Des peuples opprimes ta ligue fraternelle Jura la delivrance, enti€�re, universelle. 0 Social Circle ! Ever sweet hope of a general pact; Thy brotherhood of oppressed peoples Has sworn eternal, universal deliverance. As romantic hyperbole mounted, Bonneville immolated himself figura­ tively on the altar of primitive Germanic purity and the solar myth of revoluti on. The idealized \"people\" had become Libre et pur comme l'air, et dans rna republique, Tout est fraternite, parente germanique .... Soleil d'un autre monde, et dans ta Majeste D'un nouvel Univers sois la Divinite ... Je brule ... . 1 o 3 Free and pure as air, and in my republic, All is brotherhood, German parenthood .... Sun of another world, in thy Majesty Become the divinity of another Universe . .. I am burning .... Thomas Paine, who lived in a menage a trois with Bonneville and his wife from 1797 to 1802, believed that the Druids and Pythagoreans had combined to provide an occult ideological alternative to Christianity. An Essay on the Origin of Free Masonry, written after his return to America (with Bonneville's wife ) and immediately translated into French by Bonneville, insisted that the nat ural sun worship of the Druids had not been des troyed but merely diverted into Masonry. At its apogee of influence in I 792, the Social Circle began to publish new crypto-revolutionary works by the high priest of mysticism from Lyon, Louis-Cl aude de Saint-Martin. This long-time foe of the Enlighten­ ment had suddenly discovered in the mysterious chaos of revolution the possi bility of building a new Jerusalem by means of Pythagorean forms and numb ers . \"A radiant sun has detached itse lf from the firma­ ment and come to rest over Paris, from whence it spreads universal light.\" The \"new man\" can perceive that light by contemplating con­ centric circles that converge on a point within the flame of a lighted candle, thereby \"rein tegrating\" himself with the primal elements of air, earth, and water .

They were not-as we have seen­ politic al-military leaders , but journ alist-intellectuals ; they were influ­ enced not so much by the rationalism of the French Enlightenment as by the occultism of the early German romanti cism. Marechal's work was widely distributed in the German-speaking world ; 11 0 but, propheti­ cally for the futu re, it was most appreciated in the distant Russian Em­ pire in the atmosphere of vague religiosity and unfocused reformism under Tsar Alexander I.

One of its leaders wrote for the society a utopian picture of St. Petersburg three hundred years in the future, where Tsarism and Orthodoxy have, in effect, been overthrown by Pythagorean forms. There is a circular temple with a plain, white ma rble altar and an open arch. Music is the only art medium per­ mitted. A phoenix with an olive branch has replaced the decapitated two­ headed eagle (the two heads of the imperial seal, allegedly represent­ ing despotism and supers tition ) .1 1 7 Alexander Pushkin, the greatest of Russian poets, referred to the Green Lamp as a circle in which \"be­ loved equ ality sat in Phrygian cap by a round table.\" 1 1s Though not so deeply involved in occultist revolutionary circles as his Polish counter­ part, Adam Mickiewic z, Pushkin shared his fas cin ation with the dedica­ tion and sacrifice that seemed to be found only within a ma gic circle of youthful revolutiona ries. The \"circle\" was, in short, the supreme symbol of what a Russian Ma sonic song of the period called Those truths of holy law Given you by Geometry. l 1 9 The Triangle Seeking some secure way to enlist those outside their inner circles, revolutionaries found inspiration in another key Pythagorean symbol : the tr iangle. If the circle suggested the objective-the ega litarian per­ fection of nature-the triangle suggested the way to get there . The triangle, a key symbol for all Masons, had particular mea ning for Pythagoreans as the simplest means of enclosing a surface with stra ight line s. The triangle expressed harmonic relationships (such as that of the Pythagorean theorem ) and became a key symbol in revolution ary ico­ nography. The revolution ary trilogy (Liberty, Equality, Fraternity ) and the tricolor (red, white, and blue) each adorned one side of the omnipres­ ent triangle on seals and stamps. Pythagorean occultism gave added importance to the symbol. Franz von Baa der's influential On the Pythagorean Square in Nature of 17 98 suggested that the three elements of nature-fire, water, and earth­ had to be energized by an \"all-animat ing principle\" or \"point of sunrise,\" represented as a dot in the center of an equilateral triangle &. , 1 2 0 Any letter, symbol, or maxim that a revolutionary group wished to venerate specially was given this central place of occult authority within the inevitable triangular sea l ,1 2 1"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"106 F ouNDATIONS OF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH Man�chal introduced the occult idea of triangular harmonies into his \"CHARTER OF THE HUMAN RACE\" in 17 93, announcing the three­ fold duties of man to be a father, son, and husband as \"traced by Na ture on ma n\" : \"a triangle beyond which he dare not pass with im­ punity.\" 122 This seemingly traditional ideal is revalidated for the liberated \"man without God\" by seeing him as a kind of secular trinity : three persons in his own substance. Man�chal often placed his own atheistic sobriquet HSD inside a triangle. In building their nuclear organizat ions, early revolutionaries showed a mania for trian gular forms. The original Illuminist idea of a nine-man inner circle was soon discarded as too susceptible to police penetration, and subsequent plans for reorganization broke the circles down into three-man \"trian gles .\" 1 2 3 One ma n from an inner group was to recruit two from an outer group for apprenticeship ; and an almost indefinite chain of interconnected organizations could then be formed. Any one member need know only two others-f rom one other group either below or above -outside his three-man cell. This process of triangulation may not have been implemented by the Illuminists-or even conceived by them. The alleged Illuminist plans were published by the Bavarian government as part of an expose, and may have been edited to appear more incrimin ating. 1 24 But whether the Right invented this tactic of the Left or merely publicized it, it was soon adopted in revolutionary circle s. This intimate and relatively se­ cure triangular form of orga nization has recurred in modern tim es : in Vietn am, Algeria, and even the Soviet Uni on.125 Shortly after his arrival in Geneva in 18o6, Buon arroti and his friends took the lead. His pro­ gram of 18o8-g for the Sublime Perfect Mas ters was sat urated with triangular symbo ls. The sign of the grade was G; 126 and the alta r in the sanctua ry to which a new member was brought was only one point in a triangle of shrines. The other two points represented the ocean (of new life, the element of water) and the volcano (or revolution , the element of earth )J27 To the east, behind the altar-ocean-volcano triangle , three candles burned in a candel abrum in the form of an equi­ lateral triangle beneath a semicircle signifying the equ ator (which in turn signified the circling of the entire globe and the perfection of eterni ty ) .128 The three men who faced this symbolic picture of the universe ma y have provided the model for Buon arroti's triumvirate form of organi­ zation. At the center of this human triangle facing the symbolic tri­ angles was the North Star, leader of the other two Grand Stars. The Polar Star was clea rly the one to steer by, and it became a favorite label for revolutionary journals. Under the assumed name of Camille, Buon arroti joined the mildly pro­ republican Masonic lodge of Sincere Friends in Geneva in order to recruit revolutio naries. However, he was under survei llance, and the lodge was infiltrated by police and shut in I8II. He then tried to continue its meet­ ings secretly, apparently reorganizing it with expanded particip ation of the military under the new name Triangle.129 Not hing more is known"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"The Occult Origins of Organization of this organization, but the choice of name and the circum stances of police repression may indicate the beg inning of triangular organization. Such a system of interlocking secret cells was apparently used in the first major plot to kill a king in post-Na poleonic Euro pe : the Spa nish Triangle Conspiracy of I8I6 . 1 30 Like Buon arroti's associates, restless young Spaniards were in transition from conspiring against Na poleon toward a broader concept of combat ing monarchs of all kin ds. The Sub­ lime Perfect Mas ters must have been sympathetic, even if they were not connected, with the Spania rds' attempt to kill the restored Ferdinand VII, who had rejected the liberal Const itution of 1812 and reinstituted the Inquisition. This triangular method of organization remained a basic means of en­ forcing conspiratorial security throughout the 183os; and was trans­ lated back into Germany in the statutes of 1836 for the first revolution­ ary organization of German emigres in Paris : the League of Outlaws. From its local \"tents\" to its central \"campfire,\" this progenitor of the original League of Communists kept various levels of organizat ion ig­ norant of one another. One man in each large group formed the con­ necting triangle with one other secret representative from a group at his own level and one connecting representative to both of them from a higher level , 1 3 1 The Philadelphian Fantasy The new secula r revolutionary, then, found a model in Pythagoras (the action-oriented intellectual ), a starting place in the circle (the micro­ cosm of perfection ), and a building tool in the triangle (the basic unit of organizat ion ). But what was he buildi ng? What was the macrocosm that the next and final revolution would reve al? The answer was, quite simply, a univer sal community of brotherly love, which revolution aries designated by its Greek name, Philadel­ phia. The Circle of Philadelp hians, conceived in 1797 and constructed some years later, was the first important revolutionary organization to arise in France after the suppression of the Babeuf conspiracy. It epit­ omized the occult conspiracies of the Na poleonic era and anticipated the larger revolution ary movements of the I8Io s and 182os. The name Philadelphia provided both the sanction of revelation and the promise of revolution. Two lost cities of antiquity had been called Philadelph ia : one in the Holy Land near present-day Amman, the other in Asia Minor and mentioned in the Book of Revelation.

The word Philadelphia entered French Masonry during a rising tide of occult influx from Germany with the founding of a Primitive Rite of Philadelphians in Narbonne in 1780. 1 32 The Germanic order of Strict Observa nce, with its chivalric ima gery and hermetic teachi ngs , had swept into France through Strasbourg on to Bordeaux in the late 1770s ; and the German-sponsored Rectified Scottish Rite esta blished itself in Lyon as the leading occult order in Franc e, 1 33 causing contemporaries to describe the Lyonnais as \"our Germans,\" whom \"obscurity does not bother.\" 1 34 The attempt of the Na rbonne group to proclaim a primitive rite was pressed farthest in Paris in the remarkable, proto-romantic lodge of the Nine Sisters. German influences aga in predominated through the founder of the lodge, a Swiss Protestant pastor, Court de Gebelin . From his first arrival in Paris from Berne in 1763 until his death in a mesmer­ ist bath in 1784, Court preceded Herder in glorifying the German lan­ guage and seeking the secrets of nature in the sounds of primitive spee ch. 135 In 1773 he published the first of nine volumes of a megalo­ manic inventor y of sounds, signs, and symbo ls : Monde primitif analyse et compare avec le monde moderne. By the third volum e, he moved from lamenting man's lost happiness to insisting that unity \"among nations\" could be rediscovered through a primordial language in which vowels were sens atio ns; consonants, ideas ; and all writin g, hieroglyphicYW On July 5, 1776, he founded the radica l, occultist Nine Sisters, which became a kind of \"UNESCO of the Eighteenth Centur y,\" attracting r8o mem­ bers including 40 foreigners within two years .l:l 7 Reading Court's Monde primitif became part of its ritu al; and by the eighth volume Court ad­ vocated \"a single political order ... a single grammar of physics and morality ... an eternal and immutable religion which creates perfec­ tion in man.\" He rejected \"words\" for \"things\" -by implication radical social reform J38 The occultism of the Old World blended with the revolutionism of the New through two of Court's closest associates in Paris : Benj amin Frank­ lin and M. L. E. Moreau de Saint-Mery. Franklin, who arrived in Paris from the real Philadelphia just before Christmas in the revolutionary year 1776, was initiated by Court into the Nine Sisters, beca me its Venerable Master,1 39 and collaborated with Court on the lodge's fifteen­ volume collect ion of political miscellany. The Nine Sisters subsequ ently printed the constitutions of all thirteen American states and became , in effect, \"the first school of const itutionalism that ever existed in Europe.\" 14 0 Moreau de Saint-Mery, who was secret ary of the educ ational arm of the Nine Sisters, conveyed back across the Atlantic to Cap-Franc;ais in Haiti a magical faith in the transforming power of science which rivaled the faith in voodoo of the oppressed natives.

They used the language of occult Mason ry in referring to the \"last degree of perfection,\" and the restoration of an \"ancient knight­ hood ( cheval erie )\" \"to unveil the truth.\" 141 The Philadelphians claimed a radical secular identity as an \"ideal little society, an image of the great future society\" with \"perfect equ ality . . . no rank, no prece­ dence,\" and a commitment to the civic educ ation and advancement of the native Creo les . 142 In the occult circles of this lush colony it was easy to contend some­ what patronizingly that \"France needs a revolution. But ... it must be enveloped in mystery.\" 14 3 The Phil adelphians became revolution ary leaders in Cap-Franc;ais during 17 89-9 1 before the blacks rose up in July 17 91, and other white colonists turned against them . They later remini sced that We took the intoxicating cup of novelty without realizing that it con­ tained poison that would tear up our own intestin es. 1 44 Brissot, who was close to the Creole Miranda in Paris and others linked with the Philadelphians in Haiti, was accused of \"trying to make Paris a new Philadelp hia\" ; 1 4 5 the hotel near the Pal ais-Royal, where Parisian leaders met with English , Irish, and American friends of the French Revolution, was nicknamed Hotel de Philadel phie ; and the magic word was used to suggest subversive internationalism in Germany and Po­ land as well. 1 4 6 Cloot s, Court's closest collaborator, had foreseen already in 17 81 that the Nine Sisters would create \"citizens of the world\" by \"forming an immense circle whose center is in Paris, but whose rays penetrate every­ where .\" 147 In his final work in 17 93, he fore saw a future in which France will have become ... a fraternal city, the city of Philadelphia, whose circumference neces­ sarily embraces the entire universe, the whole human family ( famille antropique ). Na tional and sovereign unity will be expressed by a single word : Philadelphia . Philadelphia thus became the name of a truly universal republic cen­ tered on Paris. Just as the Nat ional Assembly had become \"the resume of the world-map ( mappemo nde) of the philanthr opists,\" so \"the commune of Paris will be the meeting place and central funnel of the universal community.\" Europe and Afri ca and Asia and America will give themselves over to the vast and ha ppy city of PH ILADELPHIA. 1 4 8 Court's romantic ideal of recov ering the monde primitif found its final revolution ary expression in Marechal's Voyages of Pythagoras .

At the end of his travels, Marechal's dying Pythagoras summons his followers : Let us agree among ourselves to call monde, that is to say, a mas terpiece of harmony and perfection, what other men designate as the universe, heaven, the globe. May our school, our adoptive family, be for us a little world ( monde ) as harmonious as the great one ! 15 0 Marechal may have been the source of the term monde, which Buon­ arroti finally settled upon for his inner organization .151 But the Phil­ adelphians were the first to realize Marechal's vision ; and their history is best told through the bizarre figure of their founder, Charles Nodier : the last of the literary, Germanophile occultists to play a pioneering role in revolutionary organization. Nodier's Pentagon Yet another geome tric model for revolutionary organizat ion was sug­ gested by the occult symbol for the universal love of hum anity : the pentagon. This five-sided object provided the image of five-man cells for the first organizat ion of opposition to arise within Na poleon's army -w hich is what the Philadelphians were. Their plan of organization was conceived in 1797 by Nodier, exiled from Paris of the Directory to his native Besa n<;on, which he renamed \"Philadelphi a.\" His organizational plan developed to the point of mania the Pythagorean fascinat ion with the number s. Five is the mean num­ ber between I and g, and the mystic figure that emerged when these and intervening odd numbers were added together and divided by the number of digits .15 2 The number acqu ired revolutionary significance in the new calendar, which had five special days (the sanscul ottid es) each year set apart from any of the twelve months for special celebra­ tions, and especia lly under the new five-man Directory, which replaced the \"apost olic\" twelve-man Committee of Public Safety as the ruling ex­ ecutive arm of the revolution. In Nodier's original blueprin t, the Philadelphians appear as both the guardians of festive purity for the sanscul ottides and as a potential coun ter-Directory. The pentagon was their sign of friendship and recog­ nition ; a five-pointed star with the number five engraved on it was their seal. Initiations took place at five o'clock on the fifth day of the month , when members were to face the setting sun- wherever they happened to be-for five minutes to renew their vows to the brother hood. Power to revise the statutes was confided in \"the five oldest brothers .\" 15 3 The five-man cell appeared concurrently for a brief period in Ire­ land, 1 54 Ital y,155 and Pola nd,l5 6 and became the dominant revolution­ ary unit in France beginning with the formation of a directoral com­ mittee and a web of five-man brigades by the student organization of 181g, the Friends of Truth J57 The five-man, qu asi-military unit dom­ inated the conspiratorial organizations of Bla nqui and the first group"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"The Occult Origins of Organization Ill ever to call itself \"Communist,\" the Travailleurs-Ega litaires of 1840 in Pa ris .I 58 The five-man unit acquired added mystique in the East. The Russian Decembrists were to call for five-man ruling committees in both the executive and legisl ative branches of a post-revolutionary govern­ ment,159 and added ma rtyrolo gical mea ning to the number when their five lead ers were executed early in 1826. The concept of a nationwide network of five-man cells controlled by a central \"five\" would be revived in the Land and Liberty organizat ion of the early I 86os 1 6 0 and drama­ tized a decade later in Dostoevsky's The Possessed. The idea was to spread back to the weste rn and southern Slavs through a series of or­ ganiz ations which saw the four ordinary members of each cell as the \"fingers\" of a single hand, with a single leader (\"the thum b\") as the sole connecting link with the next, higher leve J .l 6 1 This image would appear in the name of the South Slav revolutionary \"Black Hand,\" whose as­ sassinat ion of the Ha psburg Archduke in 1914 was to bring on World War I, which would in tum give birth to the October Revolution in Russia. The original Philadelphians achieved no such prominenc e, and No­ dier's vision of an army secretly transformed from within into a revolu­ tionary brotherhood of fives never developed. But an organizat ion did gradu ally emerge and involve itself in anti-Napoleonic plots through the exotic figure of Ch arles Nodier. His career ranged from Parisian cafes to revolutionary armies to the popular stage-t hen on to jou rnalism in Ljublj ana and a visit to Russia at the very time that the first revolu­ tionary societies were formin g there ,1 6 2 Whether or not he had any influence in the East, he anticipated the Easte rn-type alien ated revolu­ tionary intel lectual. Nodier's vivid imag ination was shaped by the revolution from the time, in 1790, when as a ten-year-old boy he led a delegat ion of \"en­ fants de la patrie\" in greeting the delegates returning to his native Bes­ anc;on from the Fest ival of Federation in Paris. On that occ asion young Cha rles held a banner showing an eagle with a tricolor in its beak, 16 3 standing at the head of 200 little girls dressed in white. Like Robes­ pier re, he was much influenced by a Maso nic father, who was the prin­ cipal orator of the Besanc;on lodge \"Perfect Union .\" 164 He went with his father to Par is ; and, at age twelve on New Year's Day in 1793, read a poem calling for \"the punishment of traitors by the republican dag­ ger.\" 1 6 5 He wrote parodies of the Lord's Prayer (\"Our father who art in Hell. . . .\" ) and of the Creed : I believe in Sieye s, the father almighty, and in Robespierre, his beloved son, who suffered on the g Thermidore, was guillotined, dead and buried . . .. 1 6 H He fell under the spell of German romantic literature and of Eulogius Schneider, his tutor in Strasbourg, where he was arrested by Saint-Just in 1794.1 6 7 Returning to Paris as the revolution turned to the right, he took refuge in writing fantasies, often under the influence of opium , in erotic engagements with young men , and in the contem p lation of sui­ cide . l 6 � His attention returned to the revolution when he attended the trial of the Babeuvist group which began in Februar y 1797. The drama-"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"11 2 F OUNDATIONS OF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH tist in him particul arly warmed to the handsome figure of Buonarroti, calm under quest ioning and with his fait hful wife at his side. l 69 With the border between fact and fantasy thoroughly blurred in his mind, the eighteen-ye ar-old Nodier returned in 1797 to his native Besan­ �on and drew up his Rules of the Philadelphes. He almost cert ainly began there his collaborat ion with the other leader of the Philadelphes, Jacques Rigomer-B azin, a radical journalist from Le Mans who had par­ ticipated in the Babeuf conspiracy and was exiled to the Jura at about the same time as Nodier. 1 1 o Nodier's discussion group at the Cafe Ma rrulier in Besa n�on and his later society of white-robed Meditateurs, who met in an abandoned monast ery near Passy, were occult literary groups under the dominant influence of Bonne ville and German romanticism .l7 1 Influenced by Bonneville's translat ions of Schiller, Nodier, and Bazin invented the new dramatic genre -me lodram a-a nd slowly brought into being the occult organizat ional blueprint of the Philadelphians. Nodier was arrested in 1799; Bazin placed under surveillance after the first assas sina tion at­ tempt against Na poleon on Christmas eve of 18oo; and Nodier rearrested in 1803 when an English newspaper revealed him as the author of the anti-Napoleonic poem La Napoleone. Their first real organization appears to have been the Conspiracy of the Alliance, formed in opposition to the crowning of Na poleon as em­ peror by the Pope in Notre Dame Cathedral on December 2, 1804. The group contemplated kidnapping Na poleon as he passed through the Jura on his way to Milan to receive the crown of Italy in March 1805. 1 7 2 Some form of Nodier's original Philadelphian blue print-a t least its basic core of five inner fives -came into being in or around Besan�on under the empire. The key ingredient was the participation of two mili­ tary leaders from the Jura : General Ma let and Colonel Oudet. Malet became the leading anti-Napoleonic activist inside the French milit ary until his execution after the uprising of 1812. Oudet was the romantic hero of the first of these abortive uprisings before dying under mys­ terious circumstances just after the Battle of Wagram in 1809. Oudet was the charismatic leader for whom Nodier's miscella­ neous band of self-indulgent but imaginative intellectuals desperately longed. 1 73 He appealed to them as a handsome young man of action. Conservative by temperament and sca rred by youthful duels , Oudet fascinated Nodier and Bazin as a re al-life version of the heroes they had created in their melodram as. Nodier likened Oudet to the hero of Schiller's Conspiracy of Fiesco; 174 and he saw Oudet as a kind of anti­ Napoleon -a figure like Na poleon bigger than life and driven by the nobility of struggle more than by clarity of convictions. Oudet was ap­ parently converted to revolution ary conspiracy in 1801-02, while serv­ ing as military commandant on the islands of Re and Oleron where Buo narroti and others were impris oned. Whether or not he was won over by his captives, l 75 he ma de common cause with General Malet, deriving inspiration for revolution ary republican activity against Na­ poleon from the earli er count er-revo l ut ionary uprising in t h e V en de e. They \"prof essed admiration to the point of enthusiasm for the Ven-"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The Occult Origins of Organization 11 3 deens,\" contrasting their grass-roots fidelity to the cowardly flight of the aristocrat ic emigres. Malet seemed almost to envy the \"Happy Bourbons,\" whose dynasty was virtually relegitimized by \"the devotion of the Ven­ dee.\" 1 7G Nodier noted an affinity of spirit between the extremes of Left and Right: During the Revolution, Jacobinism and the Vendee provided all the moral elevation that there was in France .1 77 \"Moral elevation\" was more important than a precise political goal for the romant ic imagination. Most distasteful was the juste milieu : venal, compromise politics based on petty interests rather than noble goals. A single, melodram atic hero leading a simple organization-this was the Philadelphian fantasy : the radical, sublime simplification that would lead to revolution. Nodier's task was to find the lost language for the coming kingdom of brotherly love: a form of speech worthy of Oudet, the leader who left him speechle ss. 1 78 Thus, at the very time the first Philadelphian conspiracy was taking shape in r8o8, Nodier was propagating the \"primitive idioms\" of natural man in his Dictionary of Onomatopea and his Theory of Primitive Langua ges; and extracting 283 thoughts from Marechal's Voyages of Pythagoras for his Apotheo­ sis of Pythagoras, Warnings of Pythagoras , in a limited edition with pseudoantique inscriptio ns.l79 The city of publication, his native Bes­ an<;:on, was no longer referred to as Philadelphi a, but as Crotona, the city where Pythagoras's active brotherhood had been founded. Malet planned in r8o8 to overthrow Napoleon while he was occupied in Sp ain and to set up a t emporary dictatorship in the name of the French Senate that would prepare a republican constitution for France. The plot was uncovered and five hundred arrested. But, in r8og, Malet returned to Nodier's original idea for the Philadelphians of a fusion between J acobin and royalist foes of Napoleon into a conspiracy that was \"properly speaking neither royalist nor republican.\" 1 8 0 Malet was plan­ ning in r8og to announce the overthrow of Napoleon in Notre Dame Cathedral in order to reassure the Right. l8 1 He included two aristocratic royalists in the government he proposed to form after the coup he planned for October r8r2 when Napoleon was in Russia. He appealed to royalists with his message to the army: Show France and Europe that you are no longer soldiers of Bonaparte, just as you are not soldiers of Robespierre. l 82 Malet's insurrection at dawn on October 23 very nearly succeeded. He seized the bank, treasury, and other key municipal buildings in Paris and gained the allegiance of two battalions after announcing that Na­ poleon had died in Russia. But he never disarmed the police; his fol­ l owers fell into disarray; and some fifteen hundred were arrested. Before Malet was executed, he made a courtroom response worthy of Nodier's melodramas to the prosecu tor's quest ion of who his collab­ orators had been: \"You yourself, sir, and all of France if I had suc­ ceeded.\" 18 3"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"F OUNDATIONS OF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH By that time, Nodier was in exile in distant Ljubljana, suspected of counter-revolutionary activity but undaunted in his romantic fantasi es. The newly found Slavs now represented primitive, natural purity, the Sparta of his dreams, the \"last and touching shelter of the ancient ways.\" 18 4 The ideological intensity of his original Philadelphian ideal had not survived beyond 18og when Oudet was killed and Bazin was im­ prisoned, where he remained for the rest of the Napoleonic era. Hence­ forth anti-Napoleonic activity among Frenchmen was concentrated in military cabals pointing toward opportunistic insurrection . Buonarroti's Monde The grandiose ideal of an occult revolution ary brotherhood was taken up with even greater intensity by the Italian version of the Philadel­ phians, the Adelph ians.1 8 5 Formed no later than 1807 among exiles in Paris under Buonarroti's friend, Luigi Angeloni, the Adelphians seem to have considered themselves even more consciously than the Philadel­ phians an inner controlling organizat ion within a broader revolution­ ary movement. The Italians, too, used pseudonyms (including Weis­ haupt's \"Spartacus\" ) and code words (\"secret\" for \"revolutio n,\" \"money\" for \"arms\") 18 6 while legitimizing violence through occult symbols. In­ ner circles were now said to represent the letter 0-suggesting the martyred Oudet, the verb to kill ( occide ), and the Olympians of imag­ ined antiquityJB7 There was even an Italian version of the melodramas of Nodier and Rigomer, because the revolutiona ry imagination of the Italians in France was shaped by the heroic plays and Masonic fantasies of Francesco Salfi's romantic revolt against the \"languid imagination\" of his complacent countrymen. 1 ss Buon arroti reestablished his links with broader revolution ary move­ ments through Angeloni and the Adelphi ans, whose statutes of I8II coincided with and strongly resembled his own first blueprint for the Sublime Perfect Masters J8 9 On July 22, 1812, he issued \"from below the Equator\" the first \"decree of the Great Firmament\" incorporating both Adelphians and Philade lphians into a new order. A counsel of three members was to propose each new member .19 o Though there is no evidence of any direct response to this call, Buonarroti's entourage was at least loosely linked with Malet's final conspiracy. During the Restoration, he refined his concept, insisting that \"instruc­ tion on the falsehood of Christian revelation\" be given before conferring the title Tieboar (\"Tyrannum interfic e, Bona omnia antiqua re­ cupera\" ), 1 9 1 writing a Latin Profess ion de foi for both the outer, five­ man circles (\"the Synod of 0 \" ) and the inner, three-man circle (\"the Church of Q \") . 1 9 2 He expanded his contacts with the French, but placed his hopes increasingly on Italy and used the German Illuminist term Weise for the central figure in the inner circle of Sublime Perfect Masters .193 As the tide of revolution seemed to rise again, Buonar roti dipped once more into the world of the occult for his second and last blueprint for a world revolutionary organiz ation: Monde or \"world.\" He saw this revolutionary microcosm, Monde, as liberating and uni-"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"The Occult Origins of Organization 115 fying the ma croco sm, realizing (in the words of the pass word of the final grade ) felicitas -consensus for all the world. Buon arro ti assumed the new pseudonym of Polyc arp ,l94 naming himself for the early Chris­ tian evangelist who had bridged the gap between the first apostles and the institutional church. He meant to represent a similar historic link between the apostles of the revolution ary era and the institutionalized movements of the Restoration . He sought to establish connections with other movements through \"mobile deacons\" and to strengthen authority by invoking occult titles like \"archont\" for Angelo ni.l 95 The documents also speak of freres intimes, who were to watch for spies and test the loyalty of new members , and of a new set of four grades : adolescent, man, theologian, and philosopher. l 9 6 His occult structures were all thinly staffed, and often represented more a figment of im agination than a fact of organization. But they captured the imaginati on even as the police captured them-the awak­ ening romantic imag inat ion of the young in restless sea rch of \"the mir­ acle that will release each of them from mediocrity .\" 1 9 7 The Philadel­ phians in France, the Adelphians in Italy, and Buon arroti's \"world\" in Geneva- all saw themselves as the \"party of the vanquished\" 1 9 8 dedi­ cat ed to a vague republ ican-cons titutional ideal into which everyone poured his private hopes for an alternative to Na poleon . The radical republican Constitution of 1793 was generally accepted as the ideal precisely because it had not been put into practice. The new generation, having had its hopes raised in the 1790s and dashed in the early 18oos, was clear er about what it opposed (Na pole on ) than what it wanted. As Nodier rec alled : The republic was for my generation a verbal talisman ( un mot talis­ manique ) of unbelievable power ... the name of a government that could be anything one wanted except that which actu ally exists. 199 Political romanticism believed in youth against age-and in heaven on earth : Not in Ut opia, subterranean fields, Or some secreted island, Heaven knows where ! But in the very world, which is the world Of all of us,-t he place where, in the end, We find our happiness, or not at all ! 2 oo This thought sounds so familiar to the modern secular mind that it is more likely to be thought banal than revolutionary. Yet it represented in its time an extraordinary, almost unprecedented form of faith -a faith made all the more intense (like that of Marx later ) by its repudia­ tion of the inherited images of (and the very word ) utopia.

He had returned from the land of the pyramids to deliver France from mediocrity and all of Europe from encrusted habit, inspiring French Masonic lodges to sing : Poursuis, Napoleon, fais encore un miracle, Etonne l'Un ivers par un nouveau spectacle, . .. les Franc;:ais ne reverraient-ils pas Corneille et Racine reparaitre ?

Could not the French see Corneille and Racine reappear? You can do what you will; command, they'll be here. The new generation of revolutionaries looked to the sun of the En­ lightenment from under the shadow of Na poleon. They internalized his Prometheanism even as they opposed his imperialism. The first at­ tempt at a secular socialist cosmology (that of Fourier) and the first authentic ally revolutionary ideologies (those of Hegel and Saint-Simon ) were conceived during the reign of Na poleon and under his impact. Buon arro ti was a kind of mirror image of the emperor, brin ging a certain Na poleonic quality to his own plans for revoluti on. 2 0 4 The mundane question of how Buona rroti made a livin g during his lonely years as a revolution ary exile leads one into the most sublime of all regions to Pythagor eans : music. Na poleon was not the only person to admire the musical talent of Buonarroti, who supported himself throughout his long career by giving piano and singing lessons-o ften retiring from all human company for long solo sessions. A French visi­ tor to Geneva in I8II described how Buona rroti's \"superb and inspired head\" rose above the piano : He was dreaming, improvising, then reining himself in to produce fire­ works on his instrument with long, agile and powerful fingers, bursting into songs without words that seemed to be the explosion of mysterious thoughts . . . , 2 0 5 \"Songs without words\" were for the Pythagoreans the ultimate form of conversation of the cosmos with itself. The \"music of the spheres\" was the highest form of discourse, expressing \"the harmony of creation, or rather of the world as it should be.\" 2 0 6 The occultist Antoine Fabre d'Olive t, who composed all ma nner of fantastic works in the revolution­ ary era climaxing in his Golden Verses of Pythagoras,207 left behind a posthumous work that proclaimed music as \"the science of harmonic relationships of the universe. \" 2 0 8 The very word music was said to have blended primitive Egyptian and Celtic roots into a Greek name 2 0 9 \"when Pythagoras appeared in Greece, rich with all the illumination of Afr ica and Asia, about nine centuries after Orphe us,\" and left behind a sect \"which even to d ay is not entirely extinct. \" 21o Fascinat ion with music as the lost language of liberation led Buonar-"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The Occult Origins of Organization 117 roti's friend, Luigi Angeloni, to publish in Paris a dissert ation on the medieval origins of musical not ation even as he was organizing his Adelphian revolutionar ies .2 11 For the romantic mind, music was the realm of freedom : the most spiritual of the arts, releasing emotion yet creating order in the dimension of time. Music freed man from spatial and ma terial limitations for a new sense of boundless expectation. Mu­ sic was the expression of modern, \"Faustian\" man, for whom infinite striving had replaced the finite mast ery of classical for ms,2 1 2 the lan­ guage of hope which was speci ally \"open to the future .\" 21 3 The music in the life of Buon arroti and Angeloni, the melody in the melodramas of Nodier, Bazin, and Salfi- all were expressions of as­ piration rather than inspiration , of emotion rather than inte llect. The text for Buona rroti's \"songs without words\" was to be provided by the leader of the last important revolutionary organizat ion he directly found ed : the Flemish Society of Brother hood, of Jacob Kats in the 183os. 214 Kats, who lived on to influence the German emigres in Brussels who gathered around Karl Marx to create the Communist League, chose Pythagoras as his revolution ary pseudonym and projected the Pytha­ gorean ideal in his revolutionary mystery drama The Earthly Paradise. He flooded music into the play- and later into the Flemish lower classes broadly, creating the first theater for popular Flemish music in Brussels during the Revolu tion of 1848. 21 5 This was , as we shall see, the wa ve of the future. For music became the handm aiden of ethnic rather than class conscio usness , of fraternity rather than equality. The medium of music found its messag e in the romantic era on the operatic stag e in the service of national rather than social revolution. But the belief in the liberating power of music derived from the occult fascin ation of the Pythagorean pioneers of the revolution ary tradition with disco vering the lost harmony of natu re . They sought a language that went beyond words to soun ds-a legitimacy that moved beyond space to time. The Interaction of Extremes Well before the revolution, Mercier, the friend of Bonneville , Restif, and Nodier, had introduced the phrase les extremes se touchent as a cha pter heading in his Tableaux de Paris . He was anticipating a fateful fact about the early revolutionaries and a reappe aring reality of revolu­ tionary dynamics : the affinity and unconscious borrowings between the extremes of Right and Left. The interaction of extremes affected the revolution ary tradition in two ways : dialectically and symbiotically. Dialectica lly, the radical, secular Illuminists on the Left developed their sense both of univ ersal, peda­ go gic missi on and of secret, hierarchical method from the conse rvative Christian Jesuit order on the Right. The Illuminist strain represented the hard, ideological core of the revolution ary faith as it developed from Bonneville through Babeuf to Buonarroti. Symbiotically, the broader spectrum of opportunistic revolution ary leaders and functionaries drew in the early days of the French Revolu-"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"ll8 ----��- --- - ------ ----- --- -- F ouNDATIONS oF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH tion on an equa lly broad range of reactionary, pseudo-chiva lric higher orders of Maso nry. The symbiosis became even more intimate during the Na poleonic era when monarchists and republicans borrowed repeat­ edly from one another while coll aborating in common opposition to Bonaparte. The dialectic of Left-Right interaction began as we have seen-l ike so much else in the \"French\" Revolution-in Germany well before 1789. Adam Weishaupt had derived his concept of hierarchical organizat ion in pursuit of a global mission directly from the Jesuits, 216 and Knigge had described the Illuminist program as one using Jesuit methods to combat Jesuit objectives, a \"counter-conspiracy of progressive, enlight­ ened forces .\" 2 17 Subsequent Illuminist propaganda contended that there was a secret Jesuit conspiracy, and that the nominally abolished order had est ablished underground links between Bavarian Jesuits and Berlin Rosicru cians. 218 As the conspiracy mania grew, Weishaupt him­ self was accused of being a secret Jesuit. 2 1 9 The Illuminists became more revolutionary in the course of the 178os precisely in the process of winning converts from conservative Masonic lodges of Strict Observance. The anti-Illuminist campaign of German conservatives in the 1790s was in many ways simply an echo of the anti-Jesuit campa ign that the radical Illuminists themselves had launched in the 178os. Revolution­ aries began to take Illuminist ideas seriously (long after Illuminism as a movement was dead ) because of the panic that the Illuminist label seemed to produce among conservativ es. Buona rroti appe ars to have first discovered the Illuminists through an ant agonistic expose by the archconservative Elector of Bavar ia. 220 The \"great fear\" of an \"aristo­ cratic conspiracy\" in the summer of 1789 in France helped create the conspiracy it assumed; and conservative fears during 1790 of an \"in­ fernal cabal\" of revolutionaries may have helped shape Buona rroti's first plans for forming such a caba J .221 The Illuminist myth both \"crystallized the antirevolutionary forces of central Europe\" 222 and-pa radoxically-r evived hopes among some revolution aries. How the fear� of the Right dialectically became t he fascinat ion of the Left is illustrated by the case of Hungary. Ignatius Martinov ics, a Catholic priest and physics profe ssor, was hired by the Ha psburg police to report on the alleged Illuminist dan ger in Budapest. He became absorbed in his subject, however, and soon drew up plans to provide Hungarian radicals with an Illuminist-ty pe, hierarchical or­ ganization. Martinovics wrote separate cat echisms in May 1794 for both the open Associ ation of Reformers and a secret, inner Associ ation of Liberty and Equality.2 2 3 The first organizat ion was to acc omplish a po­ litical revolution for national independe nce; the second, a social revolt on behalf of the serfs. Martinov ics, the self-proclaimed Democritus of the Mountain, was soon arrested along with many of the two hundred to three hundred conspirators. (Despite a final reversion to coll aboration with the polic e, Martinovics was beheaded in May 1795.) 224 The dialectical interaction of Right and Left was also a factor in the prerevolutionary popul arization of the ideas of Rousseau and Court de Gebelin within France. Of course, the literary cult of Rousseau in the"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The Occul t Origins of Organization ll 9 178os led in some cases directly to the political cult of 1790-94. But Court de Gebelin's own Rousseauist work, Duties of the Prince and of the Citizen,2 2 5 was probably less influential among radicals than the dialectical impact of reactiona ry attacks such as that of the Abbe Le Gros, Analysis of the Works of Rousseau and Court de Gebelin. Le Gros unintentionally revived interest in the occult thought of the deceased Court by suggesting already in 1786 that Court was merely codifying the subversive ideas of Rousseau in a desire \"to effect in the Universe the greatest of revoluti ons.\" 226 The interborrowing between monarchists and republicans in common opposition to Napoleon began with the very first acts of resistance to his dict atorship in I 8oo. The \"infernal machine\" (a cart loaded with gunpowder) detonated in the rue Nicaise in Paris by royalists appears to have imitated an earlier machine designed by J acobins .227 The intel­ lectual discussion group that took shape at the same time on the rue des Marins brought together elements of the two extremes and gave birth to the Philadelphi ans, who also mixed royalists and republic ans. The Philadelphians followed the Babeuvists in idealizing from the Left the grass-roots heroism of the Vendee on the Right. Extremists tended to share a common opposit ion to moderation that w as more intense than their opposition to one another. This attitude was a legacy of the revolution ary era and its basic drive toward rad­ ical simplification. Moderate positions tended to complicate political calculation-and they inspired a special contempt among activists on both sides. Robespierre coined the scornful term moderantisme, which \"is to moderation what impotence is to chastity.\" 22 8 Either Left or Right, \"mounta in\" or \"plain\" was preferable to \"the swamp\" or mod­ erate Center in the National Assembly. The interborrowing between extremes was particularly striking in backward agrarian regions on the European periphery : the Iberian and Italian peninsulas and Russia. These centers of resistance to N apole­ onic authority were among the first to produce revolutionary move­ ments after his demise. Tsar Alexander I mixed both revolutionary and reactionary impulses within himself. Both Metternich and his leading foe on the Left (the Italian Carbonari) believed that the tsar supported the Italian revolutionar ies.229 In Poland, where a national Masonic net­ work converted itself into a new revolution ary organizat ion (the Polish National Society of Freemasons ) in I819 -2 1, a key revolution ary leader was concurrently head of the secret police.23 0 The Polonophile Society of the United Slavs, the most revolution ary Russian group of the period, p romised the ideal of pan-slav solidarity, which eventually became the reactionary alternative to revolution ary ideology in Russia. British leadership in the anti-Napoleonic struggle encouraged the blending of Right and Left throughout southern Europe- from Greece through southern Italy and Sicily to Spain and Portugal. The British medium for mobilizing elites politically was often the conservative Scott ish orders of Masonry; 2\"1 but the main English messa ge ( consti­ tutional limitation on royal power) was a revolutionary concept in these lands of absolutism. As earl y as June 1803, British intelligence advised"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"120 F oUNDATIONS OF THE R EVOLUTIONARY F AITH ... that the Republicans and the Royalists were very numerous and if they could be brought to trust each other ... a revolution might be operated. 2 3 2 Although such trust was never achiev ed, Right-Left colla boration be­ came commonplace in the national resistance movements to Napoleon. In Portugal, for instance, republican Philadelphians collaborated with the conservative English commander, the Duke of Wellin gton. 233 Spain provided perhaps the most striking illustration. The central point of mobilization for the army-b ased revolution ary societies was es­ tablished in I8og in the former headqua rters of the Inquisition . Mem­ bers of these societies were haunted by continuing uncertainty as to whether their allegiance was to a king more conservative tha n Na­ poleon or to a revolution more radical than that of the French. Right­ Left confusion extended to the hardy Basques, who lent important lead­ ership to the protracted Spanish resistance against Na poleon. They became (and have remained) inventive practitioners of the irregular war­ fare that wore down the French conventional forces. The most impor­ tant guer rilla leader, Francisco Espoz y Mina of Na varre, who later led the revolutionary army that bat tled the right-wing Carlists, nevertheless went through an extreme monarchist phase of his own in 1814, when he formally executed by a firin g squad a copy of the Constitution of 1812. Another key guerrilla leader, Jeronimo Merino of Burgos moved in the opposite direction to become a leader of the same Carli sts. Yet another guerri lla, Merino's lieutenant Eugenio Aviraneta of Irun, ended up as the leading apostle of continuing revolutionary conspiracy in the His­ panic world. He founded a five-man central revolution ary cell in North­ ern Spain ( El Aventi no), sought international support for est ablishing a republic in Zaragoza in the early 182os, and remained act ive in repub­ lican consp iracies down to the middle of the century, including ma king trips as far afield as Mexico and the Philippine s. 234 Symbiosis between the extremes of Right and Left is evident in the career of the man who became the leading counter-revolution ary of the era : Joseph de Maistre . As a young and ambitious magistrate, de Mais­ tre became a Mason in 1773 and called for an American Revolutio n even before the Americans did in his politically charged eulogy of 1775 to the King of Sardini a: Liberty, insulted in Europe, has taken flight to another hemisphere. It coasts over the Canadian ices, arms the pe aceful Pennsylvanian, and from the heart of Philadelphia cries out to the British .. . ,23 5 De Maistre later confessed that only a radical conversion by the Jesuits kept him \"from becoming an orator in the Constituent Assem­ bly. \" 236 De Maistre took his own positive ideal from the negat ive por­ trayal of conservative Cat holicism in Germany by the revolutionary Mira beau. 23 7 De Maistre's counte r-revolutionary ma nifesto of 1796, Considerations on France, betrayed a hypnotic fascinat ion with the revolution more extreme than that shown by earlier antirevolution arie s. De Ma istre outdid the revolutionaries themselves in insisting on the absolute nov-"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"The Occult Origins of Organization 121 elty of the revoluti on. It was a direct, mysterious act of providence, a \"miracle\" of evil calling for a counter -miracle : the establishment of papal theocracy. 2 SR Far from being a simple throwb ack to medieva l Catholicism, de Mais­ tre's call had a modern ring which derived from his long exposure to German romantic thought while in exile. 2 39 His long residence in St. Petersburg led him to predict that upheavals in that country would hencefo rth be led not by peasant Jacqueries like that of Pugachev against Catherine the Great, but by \"Pugachevs from the universitie s.\" 2 4 0 De Maistre called from the Right for violent measures to restore au­ thoritarian rule by the pope. Man§chal argued from the Left for a similar militant dict atorship in a memorandum to Napoleon of 17 98. He pointed out, like de Maistre, the virtues of war and the dangers of degeneracy in any peace negotiated before the process of \"regeneration\" was underway .24 1 He called in vain on Napoleon to lead the failing revolution in terms similar to those used by de Maistre imploring the pope to lead the counter-re volution. Napoleon was urged to become a ... dict ator not just of the French republic, but of all the other powers of Europe . .. the Founder of a universal and federative Republic . 242 Marechal echoed Buonarroti's fear of a compromise peace brokered by England such as Napoleon's fellow-Corsican Paoli had accepted.243 The model for liberation was Napoleon's Italian campaign : \"You revo­ lutionize Italy first, and then preach prudence and calm.\" 244 De Mais­ tre, who became Sardinian ambass ador to St. Petersburg, turned to Rus­ sia as the elemental, uncommitted power that might somehow save Europe. Marechal seems to have entertained, if he did not espouse, this thought at the end of his remarkable History of Russia of 18 02. Ostensibly the work seeks to discredit all autocratic government, repre­ senting Russian history as an unmitigated series of crimes and attack­ ing those like Voltaire who purported to find hope there. Insisting that \"truth is always brutal,\" 24 5 Marechal seemed at times to be attacking Napoleon as well. But, in a darkly brilliant supplement to this other­ wise dull work, the veteran revolutiona ry presented a blueprint for the suppression of revolutionary movements : The Good and Last Advice of Catherine II to Paul I. Marechal likened it to a new version of Machiavelli's Princ e; and it is indeed a political classic, which deepens the mystery of Marechal's late years and his seeming immunity from arrest even during periods of extreme reaction. The work reveals either the extraordinary penetra­ tion by the extreme Left into the thinking of the extreme Right-or possibly even some final movement of Marechal from one extreme to the other. Marechal's Catherine instructs her son on how to prevent the \"distant political revolution which will befall us if its giant steps are allowed to continue as they have for seven years.\" 246 \"Learn from me,\" she ad­ vises, \"the science of conjuring with popular storms.

The public must not be courted with favors but dazzled with \"the ma gic of the throne\" and kept \"breathless\" with activity : wars, parades, and festivals. Do not leave the people time to think .... The common lot of men love movement .... Stagnant waters become spoiled and produce disease. 2 5 o Princely rule is threatened either by \"armed confederations\" like Po­ land or \"unarmed confederations that are called clubs in England, and under the name of societies and patriotic circles have brought a deluge of crimes and calamities to Fran ce.\" 251 The true monarch must main­ tain \"san g-froid in great political crises\" and indifference to the fate of indiv iduals, for he is \"a being below God only, but above all men.\" 252 At the height where we are placed, my son, we need have regard only for the ensemble; and here again we model ourselves on nature, which seems to abandon to themselves those beings that it no longer needs. 2•i� Marechal seems to see his own egalitarian position as the most dan­ gerous challenge to the old order. Cat herine denounces \"these vile mag­ istrates of the people\" who \"write ostentat iously the word equality at the head of their decr ees.\" 254 She advises her son that there is nothing to be done with the \"handful of parvenus\" who would lead France into that \"den of thieves\" known as democracy except to outsh ine them in wisdom and purity. This political polarization into revolutionary and reaction ary positions -each understanding the other better than any position in between­ became chara cteristic of the Restoration. Paul Didier, lead er of the first and most seminal revolutionary conspiracy of that era, had been an arch-royalist during the revolutionary and Na poleonic perio ds. He argued in his Spirit and Vow of the French (I 799 ) and his Return to Religion (I 802) for a unitary, total faith as the essential bond for society .255 He prefer red, therefore, to move all the way over to the revolutionary camp rather than support the compromise formula of a constitutional monarchy after I8IS. The unsuccessful conspiracy that he mounted just north of Grenoble was denounced by perplexed royal­ ists as the act of one \"who has now betrayed success ively all the govern­ ments in France for 20 years.\" 256 Didier's defense was that I do not wish to defy either laws or men; I am only defying irre li gion .257"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The Occult Origins of Organization 123 The romantic temperament called for heroism in the name of faith and tended to rule out middle positions. The term \"ultra,\" used in France to descr ibe the extre me , theocratic Right, was invoked in Italy for revolutionaries of the far Left. Moderate defenders of the compro­ mise settlement of IBIS in France were saddled with the less compli­ mentary label of \"doctrin aire .\" Perhaps the two most influential new reacti onaries of the era were both refugees from the revolutionary occultist infatuations of an earlier peri od. Karl Eckhar tshausen, the leading propagator of the antirevolu­ tionary mysticism of the \"Holy Alli ance,\" was a Bavarian who had briefly joined and subsequently studied at length the Illuminist Or­ der.258 Joseph de Maistre , the most influential among the ultramon­ tanist breed of reactionary, had been a leader of radical occult Ma­ sonry in prerevolutionary Fran ce. The most important two figures in system atizing the police repres­ sion of revolution ary forces in France were both former revolutionary extrem ists.

In one of the last lett ers which de Maist re received just before his death in I82I, Lamennais (who was moving in the opposite direction from ultramontanism to an ultrademocratic faith in the masses ) wrote prophetica lly: There will be no more middle way between faith and nothing ness.

There­ after, however, the nationalist ideal of fraternite was increasingly dis­ sociated by revolutionaries from the liberte of the liberals-p articularly in central and easte rn Europe. And in western Europ e, constitutional liberalism lost some of its earlier links with revolution ary nationalism -becoming an experim ental, evolution ary alternative to the revolu­ tionary path which increasingly emphasized ideology and viole nce. In the I 84os a new generation of revolutionaries turned to socialist rather than nationalist ideals -revivin g the banner of egalite as a rival to the fraternite of nat ional revoluti onaries. The long struggle thus began between the two ma in branches of the revolutionary faith. Paris re­ mained the Mecca of the faith; but the dominance of nationalism waned after the defeat of the revolutions of 1848; and the last Parisian revolu­ tion-the Commune of 1871-became a legend and model for the social revolutionaries of the future. This entire, Francocent ric period of revolutionary ferment was suffused with a florid romanticism that sought to mobilize the imag ination with naturalistic imagery. In an age of accelerating indus trialization and urbanization, there seemed a compens atory need to identify revolution­ ary organizat ion with pas toral simplicity. Dame Na ture was no longer mat hematical but organic. Her servant was no longer an aristocratic mason building a temple in stone but a democratic \"charcoal burner\" returning to a primeval fores t.l Beyond the forgotten folklore and ne­ glected vernacula r that nationalist revolutionaries everywhere sought to recover lay an imagin ary golden age.2 In the Latin American revolu­ tions this idealized state of nature was associated with the period prior to foreign domina nce : a return to an Aztec idyll after \"a sleep of three centuries \" in the Mexican Revolution of I8o8-Io; a to past oral, six­ teenth-century Araucania in the subsequent Chilean (and to some ex­ tent the Argentine and the Peruv ian ) Revolution .4 In the Latin part of North Americ a, too, the earliest uprising of French Canadians against Anglo-Saxon dominance in 1837 was led by a \"secret associ ation of brother huntsmen.\" 5 Social revolutionaries no less than the dominant national revolution­ aries sought to begin building a new world by recovering vanished perfection and familial feelings in rural settings. Buon arroti's Parisian rival to the nationalistic Carbonari, his True Italians, called themselves Famili es-a s did Blanqui's pioneering social revolutionary organizat ion of 1834, the Societ y of the Families. Blanqui replaced his Families with an organizat ion with even more pretensions of recreating the harmonies of nature : a Society of the Seasons organized into a hierarchy of weeks, month s, and seasons. The pioneering communist society in Lyon in 1836 was the Society of Flowers, which assig ned each artisan member the name of a flower or plant and met early in the mornings in a beau­ tiful fore st setting overlooking the river Saone. 6 The pioneering German social revolutionary group that met in Paris at the same time, the League of Outlaws, adopted the pose of rural bandits and organized into huts, mountai ns, and national huts, then into tents, campfires , and campfire"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The Dominance of the National Revolutiona1'ies 12 7 points. 7 Independently in Switzerland, French-speaking social revolu­ tionaries called themselves the Society of the Swan, 8 closely followed by a German-speaking group which organized itself into leaves, buds, blossoms, and fruits-with a seed at the center. 9 And in England, the trail-blazing socialist ideas of Robert Owen were popularized by a rev­ olutiona ry theory of history allegedly derived from studying beehives. Humanity was simply to follow the bees through five successi ve revolu­ tions: noble savagery, pastoral occupations, farming, and industry on to the final creation of a community of goods by the wise bee. 1o The main product of the romantic return to nature was not, however, ideal socialist alternatives but real nationalist moveme nts. The image of a nation as a vitalistic, natural organism legitimized the revolu­ tionary nationalism that dominated the Francocentric period. Since this supra-personal national ideal continues to baffle modern man as con­ sistently as it arouses him, it may merit unconventional scrutiny : of its songs and signs, of its \"people\" and their violence.

But no sooner had he destroyed this massive inventory of those who had \"troubled the tranquility of France\" since I7 92 than he was forced to begin another. Working for the restored Bourbons from ISIS until his death in I8 27, he compiled some fifteen thousand dossiers on real-life organizations far more fanciful than No­ iller's Philadelphians or Buonarroti's Sublime Perfect Masters.

Indispensable to a politicized youth movement is the raising of hopes by a tradition-shattering political leader. Like Frederick the Great for the original Sturm und Drang generation of the 1770s in Prussia or the Kennedys for the youth movement of the Ig6os in Americ a, Napoleon Bonapa rte was the inescap able model for a restless generation that had never known any other leader. Napoleon was less a father figure than a kind of idealized older brother beckoning the young into battle against patriarchal authority. At the same time, Napoleon was bigger than life, having risen \"above the earthly thought of founding a dynasty,\" ac­ cepting instead ... the providential mission ... to destroy the isolation of peoples, spread civilization afar, shatter the diadem s. a He had, in short, attempted what others had only dreamed of: the political transformation of the world. Napoleon's messia nic reappearance from Elba for the \"hundred days\" prior to his final defeat at Waterloo had restored the image of Napoleon as revolutionary rather than tyrant. He had adopted the constitutional banners of civil liberties and a federal distribution of power. He had at last brought to his side the Marquis de Lafayette, the symbol of successful constitutional revolution in both America and France. Whether young Europeans fought for or against him, Napoleon left them with a thirst for heroism and even martyrdom. He widened hori­ zons, raised appetites, and infected young Europe with politica l pas­ sions. The three nations that dominated the revolution ary tradition of the early nineteenth centur y-France, Italy, and Poland-were precisely those in which the cult of Napoleon was most developed. The new revolutionaries awakened during the Napoleonic era did not yet seek sweeping social change; but they clearly wanted something more than mere political independence and constitutional reform. Mic­ kiewicz spoke implausibly of combining Christ and Napole on; Piasecki alluded vaguely to \"the creation of a new people.\" 4 But to ask what it was they really wanted is to pose the most un­ answerable -if most import ant-que stion about the revolutionary vo­ cation. Mapping utopia may be more conduci ve to reverie than to revolution. Any precise list of demands may lead to ennervating dis­ cussion and division among the revolutionar ies-and provides the op­ portunity for selective cooptat ion by the existing powers. Thus, the success of early conspirators in arousing large sections of Europe against existing authority did not come from any finished vision of the society they sought.

The revolution ary movement's principal stated objective-l imiting monarchy by a formal \"constit ution\" -was perhaps its least under­ stood aspect. The French ambass ador to Naples asked a peasant in the Apulia early in 1818: \"Just what is this constitution you are demand­ ing?\" and received the answer : I don't know anything about it, but they had better give us one .5 The romantic world view of the young revolutionaries was shaped not just by the spell of Napoleon but also by the experience of camaraderie within their own small groups. These exclusively masculine fraternities sublimated eros into aspiration-providing dislocated young men in a turbulent era with a simple community of faith that suggested some earlier, less complicated time. The fraternal groupuscule was the model; the \"politics of the miraculous\" was the motor; a revolutionary Second Coming was the destination . The most important movement of the era was the Italian Carbonari: the first to mobilize the masses for a national cause through a secret organization. Attracting in a short space of time an unprecedented mem­ bership of at least three hundred thousand,6 they presented a danger to the conservative restorat ion that reached far beyond Italy. They posed a direct challenge to both the stability and the legitimacy of Hapsburg rule, the linchpin of the post-Napoleonic order. The Carbonari threatened the twin pillars of the Metternichean order, traditional bor­ ders and monarchical authority, precisely where their hold was weak­ est: in the divided Italian peninsula. The Forest Fraternit y When Buonarroti's key collaborator spoke of the revolutionary move­ ment during the restoration as \"this party of the Jura,\" 7 he provided insight into the genealogy as well as the geography of the revolution ary tradition . The original Philadelphians of the 17gos had come from the wooded and relatively unspoiled Jura region between Besanc;on and Geneva; Buonarroti and his friends operated there until he moved to Brussels in 1824; s and the romantic idea of recovering a lost golden age continued to flourish there down to the formation of Bakunin's final alliance of romantic revolutionaries, the Federation ]urasienne of the early I 87os.

A leading role was played by a veteran of the Besan- 90n group, Jean-Pierre Briot, whose fascination with a new type of forest fraternity was apparently fueled by the experience of escaping from Austrian imprisonment into the Black Forest and by his own po­ litical experience as revolution ary commissioner for the Island of Elba in 1801-02, before moving to Naples and founding the first Carbonari group in 1807.11 This new ritual order drew on the same type of extended family struc­ tures and protective loyalties that was later to produce the Mafia.l 2 It attracted lesser aristocrats and untitled professional people who had not become as extensively involved in traditional Masonic lodges as their counterparts in northern Italy.13 The Carbonari increasingly drew a hitherto quiescent populace into civic activity, and posed an immediate threat to the traditionalist Bourbon King Ferdinand I, when he was restored to the Neapolitan throne in 1815. Carbon ari ritual in the South was far more effective in mobilizing the masses than traditional Masonic ritual in the North. Naturalistic and fa­ miliar symbols replaced the occult and mathematical language of Ma­ sonry. The charcoal burners were an artisan brotherhood in the woods, not an eso teric order in a temple; they met in a bourgeois shop (the literal meaning of vendita, the term used for their local cells) rather than an aristocratic lodge; and they bade their members follow a pa­ tron saint (Theobald, who allegedly renounced civilization for the simple life of the charcoal burner) rather than to seek out the esoteric secrets of Solomon , Pythagoras, and the like. Most import ant, the Car­ bonari used popular religious symbols in this intensely Catholic region. Membership was attained by initiation into a kind of higher Christian fraternity. The postulant for the second grade of membership received a crown of thorns analogous to that of Christ's own passion. Later, as the society became more explicitly political, initiation came to include the path of Calvary past Caiaphas, Herod, and Pilate.

The Ca rbonari account of the group's origin appears to have been adopted from the account given in Abbe Ba rruel's counter­ revolutionary expose, according to which Scottish fugitives had been seeking liberty in the forests as charcoal burners . King Francis I of France was allegedly aided by them when he got lost on a hunting mission, was then initiated into their rites, and became their prot ector.l5 By r8r2 , the Ca rbonari had assumed their charac teristic structure of secret local cells ruled by a higher one : the Alta Vendita. The Carbonari became, in effect, a pyramidal cou nter-government in the Kingdom of Naples, with a self-appointed mandate to assemble a legisl ative body from other tribes (the ethnic -territorial subdivisions of the Carbonari ). Ca rbonari organizations soon spread into the papa l states and other Ital­ ian provin ces, melding a new constitutional ideal with the age-old dream of a united Italy. The Ca rbonari combined all three beliefs that we have seen to be cru­ cial to the revolutionary traditi on : belief in an uncompleted revoluti on, in the authority of Nature against tradition, and in secret, hierarchical organization. Belief in an uncompleted revolution was particularly widespread in Italy, which had provided some of the most dram atic echoes and notable foreign supporters for the original French Revolution and the Napoleonic refor ms. The Italian middle class was angered at the return of a con­ servative monarchy without even the partial guarantee of constitu­ tional liberties offered by the French Ch arter of r8rs. The society viewed itself as heir to a rich line of sects and societies that had kept alive \"the una ffected language of nature,\" and could guide man \"to the contemplation of never varying nature, to the love of man collectively .\" 1 6 Although \"the tender name of brother has been re­ nounced\" by a humanity that has fallen prey to violence and intri gue , 1 7 one could at least become a \"good cousin\" through the Carbonari. The space surrounding the meeting place was the fores t in which goodness had been preserved by the charcoal burners . Each apprentice wore a sma ll fragment of wood-hoping that it would be transformed into the higher form of charcoal and he into a charcoal burner. The Grand Master used an axe as his gavel on a wooden block, the symbolic trunk of a tree to which all branches of the society were organic ally related. These branches all shared common roots in the earth, and were part of a great common tree, whose leaves reminded the secret frater­ nity ... that as our first parents, after ha ving lost their innocence, covered their shame with leaves, [so] the Good Cousins ought to conceal the faults of their fellow men, and particularly those of the Society. l R Secrecy became almost a way of life for the Carbonari, with their meetings concealed from public view, secret handcl asps , passwor ds, and pass- signs . Hierarchical discipline was also import ant. The Grand Mas­ ter exercised absolute power over the agenda.

The wooden ladder-symbol of man's climb to perfecti on-was al­ ways present on the table of the lodge master ; and a principal sign of both the apprentices and the masters was known as the \"ladder.\" 1 9 Their ritual of recognition-the vertical extension of both arms down­ wards with clenched fists-may be a distant ancestor of the future revolutionary salute: the raised, single-armed clenched fist. Bundles (fasci) of sticks also lay on the table of the master-a symbol that harked back to ancient Rome and would be revived in the Rome of Mussolini. For the Carbonari the bundles signified \"the members of our respectable order, united in peace.\" 2 o In order for each piece of wood to be transformed symbolically into the purer, more useful form of charcoal, each meeting was conceived of as a ritual purification by fire in the furnaces of a secret grotto within a forest.2 1 Those who progressed on to the level of the great elect faced the most awesome of these ordeals by fire. The Grand Master entered through the secret single door from the West. Two guards called \"flames\" are placed at either side of the door, with two sabres like flames of fire. 22 The members sat in triangular lines in a triangular room under three over-hanging candles symbolizing the three sources of enlightenment in the great firmament (sun, moon, and northern star). The meeting was opened with seven solemn strokes of the axe by the Grand Master upon the ceremonial tree trunk to the East, now decorated not just with sym­ bolic fire but with \"numerous yellow flames.\" 2 3 Those deemed unworthy of admission could be excluded if \"black balled\" with charcoal in a black book. There was quite literally a burn­ ing obligation to meet the society's demands for both secrecy to out­ siders and full disclosure to fellow members. The names of repeatedly errant members were burned from the membersh ip rolls at public meetings.24 The Carbonari provided an ideal meeting ground for those who were politicized by the revolutionary era and shared its vague resolve to \"rid the forest of its wolves.\" 25 By 1817 , the society was printing pamphlets that suggested withholding tax payments until the king granted a written constitution .2 6 Political involvements increased until the Carbonari led the successf ul Neapolitan uprising in July 1820. Then, when Austrian troops came in to put it down , the Carbonari led a simi­ lar revolution in Piedmont to the north.27 These spectacular if short-lived Italian upheavals were the decisive events of the Restoration era for the revolutionary tradition. They were the central link in a chain of constitutional revolutions that had begun five years earlier far to the west with colonial rebellions against Spain and ended five years later with the defeat in the east of the Russian Decembr ists. The Italian upheaval was inspired by the successful revo­ lution in Spain in January 1820; 2 8 and the Italians in turn helped in­ spire the Russians."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"13 4 T HE D oMINANCE oF THE N ATIONAL R EvoLUTIONARIES Intern ational Echoes The first- and the only successful-echo of the Ca rbon ari began with a secret conclave of revolution aries held in the fall of r 820, at the very time when count er-revolutionary powers were meeting at the Troppau Congres s. A group of East Europeans gathered in Izmail at the mouth of the Danube heard plans for a forthcoming upheaval in Greece out­ lined by an organizat ion remarkably similar to the Ca rbon ari : the Philiki Hetairia or Brotherly Associat ion . Formed by Greeks in nearby Odessa in r814,29 it resembled the Italian organization in its initiation rites and oaths, its mixture of Masonic and Christian symbols. There were four levels in its hierarchy, supplemented later by three specially recruited higher levels under a seven-ma n directorate. This complex, secret structure grew rapidly, largely within the Greek merchant com­ munity of the Mediterr anean. Its affiliates spread from Gibraltar to the Russian Black Sea ports. It provided a rallying cause and a refuge for disgruntled Ba lkan veterans of a decade of intermittent struggle against the Turks. The Heta iria had four advantages over the Carbon ari : an important sponsor within the continental power structure (G eneral Alexander Ypsilanti, aide-de-ca mp to Tsar Alexander I); a non-European foe (the Moslem Turks ); a more explicitly political focus (its basic higher and lower orders being those of citizen and administrator respectively ); and, above all, a song. For the Greek national movement had been called into being by a militant, anti-Turkish hymn, the Thourios, which elec­ trified the Greek people with a rapidity \"perhaps unique in hist ory\" even before its author- poet, Rhigas Velestinl is, was arrested with his flute and two wood instruments and turned over by the Hapsburgs to the Ottomans for execution in 1798. If the rudiment ary org anization of \"good cousins\" that he had founded in Vienna with branches in Belgrade and Bucharest was in some respects a forerunner of the Hetairia, his anthem anticipated the evoc ative role we shall find music repeatedly playing in nineteenth-cen tury national revolutio ns.3 0 Since the song of Rhigas appealed to all Ba lkan peopl es, and the Het airia of Ypsilanti (w hom Rhigas had once served as secreta ry ) was strong throughout the Ba lka ns, hopes rose for a widespread insu rrec­ tion to be supported by Russian arms against the Tur ks. But the assas­ sination in r8r7 of the militant Karageorge, the former elected head of constitutional Serbia, deprived the Heta iria of its most powerful ally. The failure of an uprising in Moldavia and Wallachia early in r82r dampened visions of a Danubian or trans-Balkan liberati on.31 Neverthe less , the uprising that began in Greece in March r82r, revived hope for revolution elsewhere, stimulating the romantic imaginat ion with the ideal of liberating shrines of classical antiquity and appealing even to conse rvatives as a crusade of Christian solida rity .

Even con­ servative monarchs subscribed to the \"revolution ary\" cause of fighting the Turkish Sultan. But radical romantics also imagined themselves renewing links with the cradle of democracy, and the Greek national revolution assumed an enduring historical importance for the revolution ary tradition. It raised the prestige of constitutional revolution throughout Europe at the very time when that cause seemed most humiliated. It gave an imaginat ive boost to the cause of national -as distinct from social-r evoluti on; and it mobilized politically the influential romantic writers.32 Shelley wrote his last drama Hellas in its praise; and its literary sympathizers helped popularize the new designation \"liberal\" for those who sought to limit kings and clergy with constitutions and civil libertie s. Lord Byron helped found the new quarterly Liberal and published his Verse and Prose from the South in IS22, and secured his position as romantic hero of the age by dying as a revolution ary volunteer in Greece two years later. The liberal ideal did indeed come from the South. If after Italy Greece became the chosen cause of European revolutionaries in the I82os, in the preceding decade it was in Spain that \"liberal\" first became in­ scribed on the banner of national revoluti on.33 The birth of the term \"liberal\" in Spain-used in opposition to the term \"servile\" -marks the conscious appearance of Manichaean combat terminology among revolutiona ries.34 The establishment of constitutional rule the fol­ lowing years involved in the revolutionaries' eyes, more than a m ere vic­ tory of \"democrats\" over \"aristocrats\" (the sharpest polemic dualism of the French revolutionary era). The new \"liberal\" revolution marked the birth of a new type of \"liberal\" man, freed at last from a heritage of servility. Lord Castlereagh introduced the word in the House of Commons early in I8I6, by denouncing the Spanish \"Liberales\" as \"a perfectly Jacobin­ ical party.\" 35 By then, the new ideal had already spread to France dur­ ing the one hundred days of renewed hopes that followed Napoleon's dramatic return from Elba in March I8I5. Joseph Rey of Grenoble, where Napoleon received one of his most tumultuous welcome s, told the emperor in April that the age of \"liberal ideas\" and \"liberal constitu­ tions\" had dawned; 36 and that Napoleon should head the new move­ ment as \"the favorite foster child of the most liberal of revoluti ons.\" 37 After Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo and final exile, many older fig­ ures, like Lafayette and Cousin, who had rallied to him during his \"liberal\" period, were impressed with the constitutional charter under which the restored Louis XVIII promised to rule. Lafayette confided to Jefferson his intention \"to unite ourselves with the constitutional throne of the Bourbons while struggling to make it as national and liberal as possible.\" 3 8 But to the younger generation, the \"national and liberal\" banner was sullied almost from the beginning.

Rey was inspired by his close contacts with Germany and later became an active agent in Swit­ zerland for Buona rroti's plans for an international revolutionary organi­ zati on.4 3 Union soon established links with the respectable revolutionaries who provided the backbone of what was soon to be called the French Car­ bon ari : Lafayette, Voyer d'Argen son , Dupont de l'Eure, and Victor Cousin. At the same time the swelling postwar student population in Paris began independently to use Masonic lodges for republican agita­ tion. An organization, formed soon after September r8r8 under the Illuminist name Friends of Truth , bec ame a center for student radicals and gained more than one thousand members .44 The proliferation of organizations and demonstrations in France dur­ ing r8rg -2o reveals no single directing force or program. Yet the student circles of the restorat ion shared with the police spies who pursued them the implausible ass umption that the agitation of a few would somehow produce a convulsion among the many. The students felt-all appe ar­ ances to the cont rary not withstandin g-that innovation through sud­ den political change was the destiny of modern Fran ce . Accordingly, their task was simply to throw out the foreign-i mposed rule of the Bour­ bons. The antimonarchical party known as the Independents was thus infiltrated by students who substituted the subversive Spanish label \"liberal\" and introduced the even more terrifying Italian term Ca rbonari for their organization. Using Masonic organizations for revolutionary mobilization through the Friends of Truth, the students converted the journal The French Aristarchus into a legal outlet for revolutionary ideas in r8r g. The same group attempted to organize a revolutionary \"directorial commit­ tee\" and a classical conspi ratorial web of five-man cells (\"brigades\" ). 45 Little direction was given, and these brigades often resorted to uncoor­ dinated viol ence ; but they represented the first large-sc ale deployment in France outside of military organizations of this cellular type. The French students of r 820 introduced the typical modern jus tifica­ tion of revolutionary violence as a necess ary defensive measure against the forcible undermining of their const itutional rights : All the efforts made by a people to reconquer the constitut ion which violence or intrigues have torn away from it are legitimate.4n The innumerable mini-revolts of the French Ca rbonari 4 7 were born of the belief that making manifest what was secret would somehow trig­ ger revolution ary change. There was an exaggerated faith in the power"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The Conspiratorial Constitutionalists 1 37 of a demonstration (manifesta tion) or proclam ation ( manif este). This faith related directly to the belief that some new spiritual power was being generated within the secret society. The young revolutionaries sometimes compared their power to that of ma gnetism and electrici ty-those newly discovered forces in nature that seemed to reveal new powers beyond those described by Newtonian mechan ics.48 Prati ma de a pilgrim age to visit Mesmer before joining Buon arroti in a revolutionar y career,49 and Buon arroti had an equ ally typical interest in Swedenborg .5 o Revolution was related directly to spiritualism by Barbes, one of the key figures in the secret revolution ary societies of the 183os.5 1 Robert Owen, who influenced both Rey and Buon arro ti, eventually became a full-time spir itu alist . 5 2 In this atmosphere, revolution aries turned to Buon arroti as \"an occult power whose shadowy tentacles extended over . . . Europe.\" 53 Buonar­ roti sought to use the Carbonari organizat ions as he had Masonic ones earlier, and he probably collaborated with the French republican dele­ gation that went to Naples in the mid- 182os to est ablish connections with the Carbonari .54 His principal frie nds and protectors in Genev a, the Fazy brothers, were a key link between the Italian and French move­ ments .55 James Fazy was specially fascinated by the revolution ary po­ tential of youth, and soon wrote perhaps the first programmatic decla­ ration of generational war in modern times. His Gerontocracy of 1828 saw revolution ary struggle as a necessa ry response to a political system that denied participation to anyone under forty ; and to an ideology that frustrated the enthusiasm of youth for applied science as a means of unleashing human productivi ty.5 6 Buon arroti himself crossed into Savoy from his frequent meeting place with revolutionaries just across the Swiss border at Nyon, initiat­ ing Frenchmen into the firs t grade of Carbonari membership .57 His close associate Prati est ablished a Carbon ari vente in Lausanne 5 8 and became a point of contact between the directorate of the French Car­ bon ari and the Alta Vendita in Naples. Prati had become a member of the Swiss Bible society and wrote a tract praising Swiss reformers which was published in a variety of languages (including Romansh) in the Swiss town of Chur 59-a frequent point of reunion with Germ an­ speaking revolutionar ies. Within Italy, Carbonari organizers also some­ times traveled as agents of the Bible society 6 °-l ending some credence to the widespread fear that this new, mission ary-or iented organization was potentially subve rsive if not covertly revolutionary. 61 Mter the arr ests in Piedmont of the Carbonari, revolutionaries there apparently sought links with the Buona rrotian Grand Firm ament. 62 Prat i discussed with Joseph Rey, then in exile in Bern, a possible \"Euro­ pean Union\" to be based on Rey's Union in Grenoble.

The specific inclusion of students was probably the work of the most remarkable member of the triumvir ate, Ka rl Follen of Giessen : \"the first student leader of modern times ... the prototype for all the student leaders of the next cent ury and a half.\" 6 4 Follen, an extremist leader within the new German student societies ( Burschensc haften ), soon joined other youthful emigres in Swiss exile to form a revolutionary League of Youth (Bund der ]ung end) which also sought to establish links with the Ca rbonari. The Burschens chaften were asse rtively masculine and Francophobe societies that had arisen during the national struggle against Napoleon. They emphasized vigorous gymnasti cs ; and in I8I8 , on the first anni­ versary of their outdoor festival at Wartburg, some one thousand five hundred students in long hair and open-necked, unbleached linen shirts proclaimed a \"universal students' union\" -\"the first overt, self­ conscious assertion of the intellectual elite as a political force in mod­ ern history.\" 65 As a leader of the Union's left wing, which admired the French Revolu­ tion as much as German antiquity, Follen had already in 1814 formed a German reading society which later became a German culture and friendship society, but was best known by its intervening designation­ the blacks- after the color of its members' favorite velvet attire. Seek­ ing a republican const itution for a united Germany based on the 1793 model from revolutionary Franc e,66 Follen soon became obsessed with the quest ion of how to move from endless discussion to concrete ac­ tion. \"Life without scienc e, \" he concluded was better than \"science with­ out life .\" 67 In a series of Sunda y afternoon meetings with trusted friends, he formed an activist revolutionary band , \"the uncondi tionals,\" who toyed with the idea of sel ective political ass assination. They argued that perjury and murder \"against the great robbers and murderers of popular freedom\" might be a duty. Members were \"uncond ition ally\" bound to follow the dictates of the gr oup , and \"if matters come to the worst, all who are wavering in their opinions must be sacrific ed.\" 6 8 Moving from Giessen after its student associa tion was shut in 1818 , Follen became a lecturer and counselor to student radicals in the per­ missive atmosphere of Jena. One student put his ideas into practice on March 23, I8Ig, by fatally sta bbing Kotzebue, a prominent playwright thought to be an agent of the Holy Allian ce. This assassination, which forced Follen to leave Germany, had an ele ctric effect on wa vering revolut ion arie s.

This League of Youth was alleged to be the activist arm of an ultrasecret League of Men who were supposedly already scattered throughout society and ready to constitute after the revolution a new republican government. Preparations for the revolution were assigned to the youth organization, which began recruitment in Germany during the summer of 1821 through a Jena student who had gone to Italy to participate in the Ca rbon ari revolt earlier that year.71 The idea of a Miinnerbun d-]iinglingsbund has no precise antecedent in Germany and may have been an effort to realize the first two grades of Buona rroti's Monde : men and adolescen ts.72 The German republican movement was, however, swept away in a flood tide of repression . The leading ministers of the German-speaking world me eting at Carlsbad throughout August r8rg abolished the Burschensch aften and introduced uniform censorship and political su­ pervision of the universit ies. Most members of the League of Youth were arrested; and, by the end of 1824, Follen was forced to lea ve Switzerland. He dreamed of founding a German state in America as a secure base for mounting further revolutionary agitation in Germany and throughout Europ e, but he soon settled down to become a Unitarian minister and the first professor of German literature at Ha rvard Uni­ versity. The wave of insurrections against monarchs was broken in 1823, when a French royalist army invaded Spain and rescued the king with rela­ tive ease from the constitutional obligations he had assumed in r82o. French and other foreign republicans formed a Legion of European Liberty to fight for the Spa nish liberals, but this proved as futile as ef­ forts of the International Brigade on behalf of the Spanish Republic in the 1930s. In both cases, the trend of the times was towards the Right. Fea rs were felt as far away as the United States-by President Monroe in the r82os even more acutely than by President Roosevelt in the 1930s. In December 1823, Monroe propounded his doctrine condemn­ ing intervention in the New World, fearing that the Holy Alliance might seek to reassert its sway in newly independent Hispanic America . Within Europe, the victorio us conservative tide produced a fresh crop of fanciful theories about \"the Hydra of Revolution .\" 73 Writers de­ nounced not only republicanism but Mason ry and Pythagorean symb ols .

The sides of the right angle were the Father and Son ; and the hypotenuse, whose squa re so harmoniously equalled that of the other two, represented the love of God coming down to man via the Holy Ghost.74 An anonymous study of 1823 suggested that aristocratic patrons of revolution should first renounce their own titles (Lafayette should call himself neither Ma rquis nor General , but farmer ; Voyer D'Ar genson, \"iron-maste r\" rather than Viscount, and so forth ), and presented a prototypically con­ servative view of the subversive effect of an expanding educationa l system : .. the man, who can read and write, fancies himself on an equality with his superiors, and, instead of earning his bread by honest labour, he medi­ tates on state matters, and becomes a politician, and in his heart a traitor .7r> The react ion seemed to climax in I 824 with the accession to the French throne amidst medieval pag eantry of the ultracons ervative Charles X. Ma sonry and the Carbonari were outlawed by kings and con­ demned by the p ope. Organized discussions of any kind became sus­ pect, and civil liberties waned thro ughout the continent. Russian Reprise The last echo of the constitutional rebellions came in distant Russia with the Decembrist revolt late in 1825, in which major themes of the earlier rebellions in western and southern Europe were played back in reprise. An ill-coordinated coalition of several secret organizations sought to force Russia to accept some form of constitutional limitation on ts arist power after the death of Alexander I. Its leaders were young officers and even younger students who brought unusua lly high hopes out of the Napoleonic peri od. Russia had first shared with Na poleon the dream of dividing up the civilized world and then had taken the lead in defeating him. Those young officers who had entered Paris tri­ umphantly at the beg inning of Holy Week 1814 and celebrated en masse the Easter liturgy in the squa re where Louis XVI had been guillotined (now renamed Place de la Concorde ) could not easily readjust to the petty perspectives of provincial Russian life. The Turgenev brothers, the first to form plans for a secret society, testified to the impact of the wartime experience on their political consciousn ess : The circumstances of the last war reinforced a soldier's material strength with moral strength, the strength of opinion. They had fought for the fatherland, for freedom, for independence. Then su dd e n l y it was proposed to turn these giants back into gingerbread soldie rs ! And by whom ? Political pygmi es. 76"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The Conspiratorial Constitutionalists The Turgenevs followed the familiar revolutionary pattern of deriving their organizational ideas not directly from an earlier revolution ary group, but rather from conservative attacks on a previous secret society ( the German Tugendb und) . 77 More like the quas i-religious Italian Ca rbonari than the secular French movement, young Russians dreamed of bringing spiritual rebirth to Europe by consummating Alexander I's marriage of \"religion and lib­ erty.\" They sought to use Masonic lodges, beginning with the Lodge Astrea-named for the Goddess of Justice, who had been the last to leave the Elysian fields before the end of the Golden Age. Just as the Ca rbonari at first enjoyed the pat ronage of Murat, so the Russian Decembrists received initial encouragement from Alexander himself. He actually joined the Lodge Astrea and vaguely implied that the parliament which the Poles ma intained within his expanded empire might provide a model for the rest. The characteristic move towards increased secretiveness and radical­ ism began with the transformation in 1818 of the Society for the Salva­ tion of the Fatherland into the Union of Welfare, which then developed a proto-governmental structure. A secret meeting in Moscow early in 1821 set up a \"constituent Duma\" and regional councils of the Union . The split between constitutional monarchists and radical republic ans­ chara cteristic of the Italian, French, and Spanish movements alike­ was reproduced in Russia in the conflict between the federal ideas of the Northern Society and the Jacob in version of a unitary republic in the Sout hern Society. As elsewhere, there were partisans of regici de : a sma ll group of youth who dreamed as early as 1816 -I7 of a twelve-man brotherhood that would kill the Imperial family at night on the road to Tsarskoe Selo.78 The Decembrist movement was both the last cha pter in a century-long struggle of Russian aristocratic reformers and the starting point of the modern Russian revolutionary tradition. If the revolt was also part of the European-wide chain reaction of constitutional risings against tradi­ tional monarchi es, the leaders already displayed many of the distinc­ tive characteristics of later Russian revolutionar ies-stoic, humorle ss ascet icism combined with a cult of brotherhood and Schilleresque the atric ality. 79 In December 1825, the more revolution ary faction of the movement, the so-called Sout hern Society, mounted a doomed uprising in the Chernigov Regiment. The leading theorist of this group, Paul Pestel, was one of the most inventive revolution ary thinkers of his time any­ where in Europe. He was one of the few to argue for an authoritarian, centralized revolutionary state that would consciously create a single nationality and press for egalitarian social refor ms. 80 He followed the Buona rrotian pat tern of making extensive use of Masonic lodges and symbols,s 1 and anticipated Buonar roti in calling for an immediate provisional government after a revolution .82 As the son of a former governor of Siberia and a veteran of the Napoleonic wars, Pestel had traveled widely.

After 18I5 , the incorporation into Russia of western region s-t he Baltic provinces and Poland- added non-Russians into the agita tion for political reform .83 Me anwhile in St. Petersburg, conse rvative ministers and bureaucrats (often Ger man ) had been appalled by the new wave of German student unrest in I8I6-I8 and developed a kind of domino theory of revolution spreading east from Germany through Poland to Russia. Then came word of conspiracy even further east, with returning veterans setting up small secret societies even in places like Orenburg and Astrakhan. The virus seemed to spread even to the Arctic north, when the secreta ry to the governor of Olonetsk set up a secret society called the French Parliament in Petrozavod sk.84 The barrage of revolution ary reports from afar created a giddy sense among youthful Russians of \"another mail delivery, another revoluti on.\" 85 To Pestel, the experience of the early 182os in Spain, Portugal, and Naples demonstrated the treachery of kings and the hopelessness of constitutional monarchy. Even in France and England const itutions were only masks for monarchical despotism. Revolution inside Russia might lead to international war. After Napoleon's experi ence, no one would dare invade Russia, so revolution there \"will spread safely and immediately to other countries whose people are even more bent on revolution . \" 8 6 The all-European nature of the revolutionary contagion is illustrated by the affinity that the Decembrists felt for the revolution ary constitu­ tionalists at the opposite extremit y of the contin ent : in Spain. The Spaniards' original \"little war\" (guerrilla) of popular resistance to Na­ poleon in 18o8-og had anticipated and influenced the Russians' \"parti­ san war\" against him in I8I2 -I3. Young Russian officers ha d shared with distant Spaniards a sense of common victory and-uniquely in Europ e-of contact with the inarticulate masses who made the new guerrilla tactics possible. The Decembrists took as their principal model for a constit ution that of the Spanish liberal monarchy of 1812; and for their eventual uprisin g, the bloodless Spanish Revolution of 1820.8 7 The Decembrists may also have been more closely related to other European revolutionary movements than has yet been reali zed. The original Union of Salvation was formed in 1816 among Russian officers traveling back and forth to France at precisely the time Rey founded his model Union. Once again, the Russians developed similar plans for working through Masonic lodges with a secret, three-stage hierar chy .88 F. N.

Russians had many contacts with Ita lian revolutionar ies, and tried to establish links early in r8rg.94 The Grand Duke Michael toured Italy in the same year together with his (and the tsar 's ) tutor, Laharpe, who had become a leader of the Swiss Ca rbon ari in close contact with the Italian movement .95 In May, a leading Russian periodical published an article in praise of the Sect of Pythag ori ans, be­ ginning its catechism with questions allegedly asked by Pythagoras him­ self : \"What is unive rsal ?

Equality.\" 9 6 Their credo went, if anythin g, beyond Buon arroti : Not having any private property, not knowing false pride and vain praise, far from petty things that often divide, they competed with one another only in doing good ....

The Poles had deeper links with the Italian movement through both a common backg round of collaborat ion with Na poleon and a common Ca tholic culture. The special commission that investigated the Decembrists during the first half of 1826, after their doomed uprisin g, sugg ested that their regional organization was modelled on the five regional ventes of the French Ca rbonari .9 8 Moreover, the Italians were so well informed of the plans of the Russia n movement and so optimistic about its potential that they continued to expect a second and conclusive uprising by the Decembrists in the spring of I 826 : the original secret date chosen be­ fore the abortive rising of December.99 But the Decembrists did not rise again.

The revolutionary picture in 1826 was one of total disorder. Left behind were only an aura of romantic heroism and a few martyrs . But the period had been one of critical revolutionary experiment and political tute lage-not least for one of the youngest of the French Ca rbonari, Auguste Blanqui. Even as a twenty-year-old boy, late in 1825, Blanqui had drawn inspiration from the Dece mbris ts : \"five ma rtyrs of liberty . . . illustrious victims that European democracy has inscribed on its ma rtyrology\" for having opened \"to Russia the era of progress and liberty.\" 1 0 0 He was to keep alive the conspiratorial spirit throughout the nineteenth century, and to help transmit it back to a more receptive Russia in the I 87os. Within Russia itself, a revolutionary tradition distinctive in many ways began atop Spa rrow (now Lenin ) Hills overlooking Moscow when the youthful Herzen and Ogarev swore together their \"Hannibalic oath\" to \"sacr ifice our entire lives\" to the strugg le that the Dec embrists had begun .1 0 1 Many ideas of the Russian revolutionary tradition were to come from Herzen ,1 0 2 and some of its organizational ideas from Oga­ rev.l 0 3 Russia, as we have seen, was the last to turn to revolution in the crisis of authority that followed the Na poleonic wars. A cen tury later, after the next great continental war, Russia was to be the first. But for all its international echoes and prophetic anticipation s, the post-restoration decade of revolutionary activity belonged largely to the Italians. The Ca rbonari had been the first secret org anization to lead a large-scale revolution in modern Europe. Despite its failure and disin­ tegration, the Carbon ari awakened enthusiasm for a united Italy; and provided a model for others. Its surviving members retreated into a sub-culture of loc alized groups-sometimes taking the names of their local vendita, sometimes inventing new ones, sometimes dissolving into other group s. The Carbon ari diaspora produced a bewildering variety of atomized protest group s. Classic revolutionary cells appeared with such colorful names as \"five in a family\" and \"the seven sleepers .\" The hasty military tra ining grafted onto the Ca rbon ari during the uprisings of 1820 left a legacy of militance, intensified by the execution of some eight hundred Ca rbonari leaders after the uprising was put down. Veterans of the strug­ gle formed new militant groups like the Sons of Mars of 1820 and the American Hunters ( cacciatori America ni), who met for drills in the pine woods near Ra venn a. There were the black bellies (pancie nere ) of Rome , the shirt less ones (scamiciati ) and vampires (vampiri ) of Naples, the imitators of Sand (the young ass assin ) in Sicily.

It was then that men began to confront a question that still ari ses : Should the coming revolu­ tion create a new nation of cultural brotherhood that obliterates the lines between classes? Or a new classless society that breaks down na tional borders ? Should revolution aries rely on the emotional appeal of nationalism or the intellectual appea l of social equality? This enduring quest ion was posed implicitly in the mid- 17gos. As early optimism faded, French revolutionaries began to ask if the ful­ fillment of their sta lled revolution lay in fraternite or egalite : the build­ ing of a grande nation as Na poleon urged or of a new social com­ munaute as called for by Ba beuf. The more popular idea wa s-a nd has genera lly remain ed-that of a nation, and of what the Spaniards were the first to call \"national revolution .\" 1 After the revolutions of 1830, romant ic na tionalism lost its autom atic linkage with const itutional liberalism. As na tionalism developed a new revolutionary intensity of its own, it began to confront a Ba beuvist revival from which the rival tradition of social revolution emerged. The Revolution of 1830 in France raised more hopes than it could satisfy by merely removing the last Bourbon king of France. A new gen­ eration was excited by the \"three glorious days\" of July when men were once again willin g to stand and fall on one or the other side of the barric ades.

Ardor and intelligence on the one side, honor on the other .... Poor people, great people, warriors all. 2 This romantic love of heroism -whether Vendeen or revolutionary­ made it difficult to reconcile oneself to the juste milieu of Louis Phi­ lippe. France seemed to have been reborn out of sheer enthusias m; a month later a new na tion was in fact born out of spontaneous up­ heaval in Belgium ; and this in turn inspired a heroic na tional revolu­ tion in Poland. The picture of nations rising in arms against foreign rule provided new hope for na tional and social revolutionaries alike. But nationalists were far more numer ous, and Ita lians led the way. Ha ving provided the previous model through the Ca rbonari, Italy now devised the prototype of a nat ional revolution ary orga nization in Giu­ seppe Mazzini's Young Italy. The rival call for social rather than national revolution was sounded at the same time as Ma zzini's appeals. In 1831, just as Young Italy was formed among emigres in Ma rseil les, French artisans farther up the Rhone at Lyon turned a riot into an ins urr ection, inspiring a new languag e of class warfare. French poets in 1831 spoke of a \"universal uprising\" and of a revolution ary volcano unleashing a \"lava of new Spartacuses\" to level out inequ ality and insure that \"there will be no more basta rd children on our na tive soil.\" 3 In the same Lyon , Ma zzini used the same meta phor while recruiting for an armed invasion of Savoy that he hoped would set off a chain reac tion of nationalist revolutions . \"If we act resolutely, if we show one spa rk of real fire, Italy is a volcano.\" 4 Shortly after the invasion attempt aborted and his leg ion dissolved early in 1834, a second and more massive social upheaval convulsed Lyon, inspiring some to speak of \"the great final revolt of the proleta riat.\" 5 If dramatic new models for social revolution came from Lyon, the leade rship still came from Paris. Here the awakened romantic imagina­ tion was forced to confront the prosaic reality of Louis Phili ppe's bour­ geois monarchy. With growing desperation, Parisians turned in the 183os to Mazz ini's aging Italian riv al, Bu onarroti, who had returned at last· to Paris in 1830 for the final seven years of his life. He and a younger Frenchman of Italian ancestry, Auguste Blanqui, created there in the 183o s the modern belief in a coming socia l revolution. In contrast, Ma zzini set up a series of revolutionary nationalist orga nization s- Young Italy and Young Euro pe- precisely to oppose the \"Parisian principle\" : the dependence of an entire continent on one French city. The conflict between na tional and social revolutionaries was, in es­ sence, between romanticism and rationalism : the na tionalists' emotional love of the unique and organic against the socialists' intelle ctual focus on general laws and mech anistic analys is. The nationalists saw revolu­ tion as a \"resurgence\" (the Italian risorgi mento ) or even \"resurrection\" (the Polish zmartwychwstanie) of an individual nat ion.

The inability of either tradition to understand the other is illustrated by the astonishingly inaccurate appraisal of na tionalism in Marx's Com­ munist Manifesto, written on the very eve of the widespread na tionalist upheavals of 1848. T he workingmen have no country .... Na tional differences and antag­ onisms between peoples are daily more and more vanishing. . . . 7 Nationalism rather than socialism remained the dominant revolutionary ideal even after the failures of 1848-so. The First Internat ion al, which called itself explicitly a \"Working Men's Association,\" sought out Maz­ zini before it turned to Marx for lea dersh ip at its founding in 1864. The Dom inant Nationalists Revolution ary na tion alism attracted a variety of social groups whose pattern of life had been disrupted by the early stages of the Indus trial Revolution. The new radical na tionalists came neither from the fac tory­ centered proletariat (w hich hardly even existed on the continent in 1830 ) nor for the most part from the commercial or industrial bour­ geoisi e. Three general characteristics seem to have been sha red by most of those who identified revolution with na tionalism during this period-whether they were East European aristocrats, Franco-Italian jun ior officers , German studen ts , or educated art isans . Politically, national revolutionaries sought for themselve s-a nd de­ manded for others -a greater sha re of political power than monarchs were willing to give. The drive for power appropri ated the new idea of popular sovereignty and pushed into the background the earlier Enlight­ enment concern about constitutional forms and rational balance. Socially, the new nationalists were almost all displaced people. What­ ever their class status, they had generally lost the sense of structured expectations that traditional societies had hitherto prov ided. Whereas the revolutions of 1820 had occu rred in traditional societies (Spain, southern Italy, Greec e, and Russia ), the revolutions of 1830 affected regions where the workings of a ma rket economy were relat ively ad­ vanc ed : Belgium, Rhineland Germany, northern Italy, Paris, and Poland."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"National vs. Social Revolution 14 9 Defeated or frustrated revolutionar y exiles congregated after I83o in victorious Paris and Brussels, or in the even more economic ally sophis­ ticated urban centers of London and Genev a. There , a combination of unnatural exile and urban anomie often created a compens atory longing for the family-type structures and rural images which became char­ acteristic of revolutionary national ists . The perception of creeping mechanization and uniformity created a sometimes manic desire to as­ sert the peculia rity and humanity-even the divinity-of one's own tradition. Revolutionaries no less than reactionaries of the romantic era began to look back longingly to the Middle Ages at precisely the time when they first confronted the modern, indust rial era. Occupationally, the national revolutionaries tended to work in the communications media. Whatever their class origin , the new revolu­ tionaries came together not just in Masonic-type meetings and military conspi racies, but in editorial offices and theaters. With an almost mis­ sionary spirit they invented, debated, and transmitted ideas and iden­ tities for hitherto inert sections of the European population. Their greatest spiritual adventure seemed to lie in defining the mission for one or another of the many \"peoples\" who had been suppr essed in the eighteenth century by the artificial conventions of aristocracies and the subtle tyranny of French culture. Social revolutionaries were, of course, also affected by political am­ bition, exile, and the new means of communi cation. But, during this relatively early stage of industrialization, class identities were not so cle arly perceived as national ones. Thus the nationalists were more successful in attracting a mass following. In the wake of I83o, they renewed their efforts to arouse the peoples of Europe against the mon­ archical power of what the Polish poet Mickiewicz called the \"Satanic Trinity\" of Russia, Prussia, and Austria. The Mazzinian International The man who did the most to incite the peoples of Europe against their kings was the Genoese Giuseppe Mazzini. A veteran of the Car­ bonari who had been imprisoned during the Revolution of I83o, Mazzini saw his life's mission as an \"apostolate\" that would provide ma rtyrs as well as teachings for a new type of national society. In exile in I 83 I, he founded the model society for modern revolutionary nation­ alism : Young Italy. He collaborated for a time with Buon arroti's new Society of True Italians, but soon rejected the latter's continued de­ pendence on French leadership, as well as its hierarchical \"spirit of caste,\" and challenged the idea that a small group of deracinated con­ spirators could be trusted even provisionally with dictatorial power by a people with the cultural wealth of Italy. 8 He insisted that a truly Italian movement could never tolerate either terror or one-man rule, both of which he sa w emerging from Buon arroti's appro ach.

Jansenist teachers had filled him with a moralistic religi osity; and romantic lit­ erature had infected him with a compulsion to produce inspirational writin g. More than one hundred large volumes of his collected works still do not exhaust his prose production . He particul arly excelled in the most personal of all genr es : letters to frie nd s; and his web of associ ation and influence was Europe-wide. Philosophically, Ma zzini provided a universal and not merely a paro­ chial Italian rationale for a nationalistic movement. He spoke of one master (G od), one law (prog ress ), and one earthly interpreter (the peo­ ple). No \"people\" is complete until it becomes a nation. \"The individual is too weak and humanity too vast.\" 1 o True nat ions are not in conflic t, but are only the proper organic uni ts-g eographically, linguistically, cul turally-of a harmonious international order. Symbolically, the Italian cause assumed the role that the struggle for Greek independence had played in the preceding peri od. It fired the romantic imag ination thro ughout Europe with the image of a seat of idea lized antiquity bathed in sunlight and beauty, longing for heroic rebirth , bidding everyone unite against a common oppr essor : the Ha ps­ burgs, who had replaced the Tur ks. Politically, the Italian national movement seemed to hold out the most realistic prospects for success. German nationalists were hemmed in by the Prussian and Aust rian mona rchie s; the Poles had been crushed by the Russia ns; and other movements were only beginning. The Ital­ ians, on the othe r hand, had international advantages as well as a powerful indigenous revolutionary tradition. Italy was remote from the center of the Hapsburg empire and accessible to potential foreign sources of support : Fra nce, Switzer land, and even seaborne England. Mazzini was able to mobilize on French and Swiss soil an internationa l legion of Frenc h, Germ ans, Swis s, and Poles under a Polish commander to join with Italians in an aborted attempt of Janu ary 18 34 to invade Savoy and trigger revolution in Italy.n Organizationally, the Italian movement formally became the center of a European movement on April 15, 18 34, when Ma zzini attempted to keep the international charact er of the legion alive by founding Young Europe in Bern, Swi tzerl and. Organized under a committee of seven Italian s, five Ger mans , and five Poles, Young Europe soon added a Young Swiss affiliate and smaller groups for France, Spain, Hunga ry, and Scandinavia. Mazz ini's alternative to the Buona rrotian centralism of a \"universal monarchy cont rolled from Paris\" 12 was a federation of nat ionalist mov e­ ments. By the summer of 18 35, there were 86 clubs of Young Italy (7 4 inside Italy with 693 members ), 62 Swiss clubs with 480 members , 50 Polish clubs, and 14 each for Young Germany and Young Fra nce.l3 Penetrated by spies and torn by disputes between the Italians and the Ger mans, the organization was expelled from Switzerland in August"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"National vs. Social Revolution 1836; and after Ma zzini moved to London in Janua ry 1837, it virtually ceased to exist. But the example of trans-national collaboration in the cause of nationalism had been esta blished and securely identified with Ita ly. Ma zzini's nationalist International was the first of many attempts throughout the nineteenth century to draw revolution ary nationalists together in a common struggle against traditional monarchies. The in­ ternational importance of the Italian cause extended even beyond Eu­ rope in the late thirties and early fortie s. Giuseppe Garibaldi, who had been converted by Ma zzini and condemned with him for attempted in­ surrection within the Piedmontese armed forces in 1833, took the cause of national revolution in its purest Italian form to Latin Amer ica. He joined the struggle to defend the new nation of Uruguay from the incursions of its giant neighbors , Brazil and Argen tin a. With a ship named the Mazzini and an Italian Legion mobilized under his command to \"serve the cause of nations,\" Ga ribaldi went to battle under a black flag with a volcano at the center (symbolizing respec tively the mourning of Italy and its coming revolution ). His legion acquired its \"red shirt\" uniform by expropri ating smocks in Montevideo which were intended for export to the slaughterhouses of Argentin a.14 These, the original \"bloody shirts,\" were henceforth to camouflage the blood of men rather than cattle. This characteristic Ita lian revolution ary uni­ form was later brought back from the New World to the Old when Garibaldi returned with his legion to Italy on a ship named Speranza . On the open deck of this ship of \"hope,\" Garibaldi and his followers gathered nightly on the high Atlantic in a circle for patriotic singing. Such rituals -suggest ive alike of Christian vespers and pagan incan­ tation-w ere cha ract eristic expressions of communal revolution ary ex­ pectation in the romantic era. When the Speranza final ly landed in Spain early in 1848, Garibaldi learned that revolution had already broken out in Italy. It was as if life itself had echoed their chor us, just as hope was heading home. Garibaldi rushed onstage in Nice like a heroic tenor, and aroused his audience with dramatic appearances all over Italy . His subsequent rally­ ing of besieged republican Rome against ass aults from all sides, the tragic death of his beau tiful Brazilian wife and companion-in-ar ms, Anit a, and his final departure for the United States in June 1850, on the Waterloo-all have some of the quality of Italian opera spilling over onto the stage of history. It seems appropriate that Garibaldi in exile prepared for his glorious revolutionary return to the Italian scene in a house that he shared on Sta ten Island with the greatest operatic tenor of his day, Lopenzo Salvi. 1 5 Indeed, it is well worth pondering the actual, if surpris ing, way in which opera itself, this most Italian of art for ms, interacted with­ and even helped to shape -revolutiona ry nation alism in Europe gen­ erally and Italy in particular. For the telling though elusive interaction between theater and life that was evident during the French Revolution became even more striking in the case of opera and revolution in the nineteenth century."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"T HE D oMINANCE OF THE N ATIONAL R EVOLUTIONARIES The Operatic Stimulus The connect ion between revolution and the musical theater was rec­ ognized by one revolutionary at his trial in the summer of r8 32 : People have left the churches for the theaters ... opera is a spectacle to awaken and excite the senses a vast reservoir of powerful sensual excitem ents.1 6 Opera so far had been written only for the few and rich, but in the future , it must \"awaken and excite\" the masses for social transforma­ tion s- taking advantage of the large audiences to spread ideas through agitators known as chefs d'attaque 17 at a time when political assem­ blies were prohibi ted. The \"leaders of the attack\" on the existing order in the early nine­ teenth century were the national revolutionar ies ; 18 and the emotional power of romantic nat ionalism was heightened by its intimate ties with opera. Of cour se, nationalism cast its spell throu gh many art for ms. From Da vid to Delacroix, there were pictorial icons. The revolution ary call was sounded in the dramas of Schiller and Hugo -a nd answered by the vernacular poets who became revolutionary leaders in r8 48 : La ma r­ tine in France, Pet o fi in Hungary, Mickiewicz in Poland, Herwegh in Germany. But revolution ary nationalism was a visceral ideal that reached beyond pictures and poems to the most immaterial -a nd emo­ tionally evocative-medium of the romantic era : music . Ma zzini , while he was forming Young Europe, hailed the revolutionary potential of music as a form of human communication which begins where poetry ends . . . the algebra of the spirit . . . the perfume of the whole universe ... which the materialism of our age has hidden, not exiled from the wor ld .19 Deepest of all was the connect ion with oper atic melodrama. By link­ ing music with vernacular languag e and local folklore, opera became the vehicle for national consciousness- unifying fragmented, often il­ literate audien ces. The dream of attaining total human happiness through the creat ion of a new nation required extraordinary leaps of faith . Belief in a national revolution was somehow easier for those who were already immersed in the unreal world of opera where social, spiritual, and even sexual satisfactions were simultaneously obtained through the magic of music.2 o There were three stages in linking the oper atic stage to the national revolutionary cause. Firs t, in the r76os, had come the birth of the opera comique, which lifted out of low bourgeois culture its combina­ tion of \"little songs\" (called vaudevill es ) and spoken dialogue to express everyday sentiment and to evoke direct emotional reactions from the audienc e. Gone was the aristocratic ideal of disciplining rather than arousing the passions-and the subordination of melody to a rhetorical text. Second had come the rapid development in the early days of the"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"- �-- � ---------- National vs. Social Revolution 1 53 French Revolution of a propaga ndistic , revolution ary message for the opera comique. Revolution ary operas required ever more crude plots, spectacular setti ngs, and larger orchestras attuned to outdoor acoustics and bombastic military music. Brasses replaced strings as \"Apollo put down his lyre, donned a red cap, and picked up a trum pet.\" 21 Actors playing kings were often physically abused, while republican heroes and choruses were required to repeat revolutionary choruses or insert popular songs into the action. Guillaume Tell-a landmark opera by two leading figures of the opera comique, librettist Michel Sedaine and composer Andre Gretry -co nverted the tale of a fourteenth-century Swiss foe of the Ha psburgs into a roiling revolutionary exhortation. Marechal also glorified Wil­ liam Tell 22 and collaborated with Gretry on ideological operas during the Reign of Terror. In The Feast of Reason, a sans-culotte is crowned with a cap of liberty, while a priest hails the liberating effects of pub­ licly shedding his robes. Another Marecha l-Gretry opera, Denis the Ty­ rant, celebrated the need \"to inculcate in children ... the sacredness of equa lity.\" 23 The invocation to struggle against tyranny may have been even more intense in a lost opera of the same period by Saint- Just, Selico ou les Negres. 2 4 The third and final stage in the linkage between opera and national revolution came during the Na poleonic wars . \"Revolutionary pride was transferred to the French arm ies, which were seen as liberators of the oppre ssed count rie s.\" A new genre of \"rescue operas\" glorified \"the liberation of foreign peoples or indiv iduals suffering under absolut­ ism.\" 25 The most famous of these was the 1798 work of a police chief in revolutionary France : Leonora or Wedded Love: A Spanish Historical Play in Two Acts, which provided the basis for Beethoven's only opera, Fidelia, the greatest of all operas of heroic deliverance. The opera was, in effect, banned during the first dec ade of its existe nce , with the pre­ miere delayed by Aust rian censors and then by the French entry into Vienna in 1805. Only in the revised version of 1814, amidst the buoyant hopes that followed the defeat of Na poleon , did Fidelia emblazon itself on the European imagination. The setting for the final scene in which the prisoners reappear was moved from the dungeon to the open air­ just as the thirst for liberation was about to spill out from the operatic theater into real life na tional revolution. Music helped keep alive a feeling of unity in divided and humiliated Poland.26 In I8I I, the director of the Polish Nat ional Opera Theater, Karol Kurpinski, introduced in Warsaw his new opera Kalmora, written on an altogether novel theme for the operatic stage anywhere : the American Revolution. Kalmor a, an American girl, is una ble to ma rry a British soldier until after the revolutionaries have defeated the Brit­ ish and convinced him of the supe riority of a republic to a monarchy.27 In I8I6, after the Napol eonic wars, Kurpi6.ski tried to iden tify opera with national struggle in his Cracovians and Mountaineers. Consciously reviving the title of an earlier work written just before the first par­ tition of Poland, Kurpinski turned folk dances-the polonaise and ma zurka-into symbols of suppressed nationhood."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"1 5 4 T HE D oMINANCE oF THE N ATIONAL R EVOLUTIONARIEs Kurpinski sought in vain to persuade his most gifted pupil, Frederick Chopin, to develop an operatic tradition for Poland.2 8 But Chopin's pi­ ano music transposed the same polonaise and mazurka into symbols not just of Polish pride, but of unrealized nationhood everywhe re. Schumann described Chopin's mazurkas as \"cannons buried in flow­ ers,\" 29 and Chopin's benefit concert tours throughout Europe between the revolutions of 1830 and 1848 were themselves dramatic events, mobilizing the emotions for national revoluti on. Franz Liszt's virtuoso concerts of the same era played a similar role. He dedicated his Lyon to Lamennais and called on music to recapture the \"political, philosophi­ cal and religious power\" it had allegedly exercised \"in pagan times.\" He transformed a tune from the Hunga rian gypsy violin into the Ra­ k6czi March, and played it as \"the Hungarian Marseillais e.\" 3 o Berlioz inserted into his Damnation of Faust an orchestral form of this march with bass drums suggesting cannons of liberati on, which was hailed as a revolution ary symbol at its debuts of 1846 in both Budapest and Paris. The French romantic wrote a host of idiosyncratic works in praise of national revoluti on.:n With their deep musical traditions and leadership in the drama since Schiller, the Germans developed a particularly important national school of opera. In 1817, Carl Maria von Weber first described the type of opera all Germans want: a self-contained work of art in which all artistic elements cooperate, disappear and reemerge to create a new world.3 2 Five years later in Der Freischutz, he put this new concept into prac­ tice. Focusing on a tale from Germanic folklore , he enlarged the or­ chestra and scrambled the placement of instruments, producing a new dependence on the conductor and preparing the way for the conductor­ comp o ser who was to realize his dream of a uniquely German Gesamt­ kunstwerk : Richard Wagner. The mature Wagner weaved pagan myth and a seductive new musical idiom into a unique vehicle of modern German nationalism. But his original, youthful turn to revolution ary politics prior to 1848 illustrates the more general romantic forms he later denigrated. His first and most explicitly political opera, Cola Rienzi, the last of the tribunes, was completed in Paris in 1840 to celebrate the fourteenth-century Roman revolutionar y.aa The twenty-ye ar-old Frederick Engels wrote a play in praise of the same Rienzi in the same year.34 The first organized conspiracy of the Left against Napoleon was an assassination planned to take place during the climactic chorus of an operatic premiere on October 10, I8oo. Less than two months later, the first conspiracy of the Right killed or wounded eighty in its unsuc­ cessful attempt to kill Napoleon on the way to the opera.35 On both oc­ casions, Napoleon demonstrated his sang-froid by continuing on to the opera and watching the performance as if nothing had happen ed-be­ coming thereby a kind of operatic hero in his own right.

And an operatic performance on January 12, 1821 at the Teatro d' Angennes in Turin helped precipitate the revolution that broke out in Piedmo nt.3 6 This forgotten event at the heart of the region that eventu ally led the struggle for unific ation of Italy was the beginning of the open, direct link between romantic opera and national revolution. The opera itself was a seemingly apolitical work by one of the most politically conservative composers of the age : La Gazza Ladra (The Thievish Magpie ) by Gioacch ino Rossini. Determined to outdo the Ger­ mans in an opera written for Aus trian-controlled Milan, Rossini aug­ mented both the size and the volume of his orchestra and began the process of conjuring up new sounds in the score to support new ideas in the libre tto . The conflict between a classicist and a romantic over a falsely accused servant girl was given a revolution ary reading by the Italians, who had already felt their emotions aroused by Moses in Egypt, Rossini's earlier opera about the chosen people seeking libera­ tion from bondage. The potenti ally revolution ary message was empha­ sized more clearly in the Parisian triumph of the new French version of the opera in 1827. Thus, Rossini, who had been Metternich's guest at the Congress of Verona and chief composer to the ultraconservative King Charles X of France, found his audiences identifying his real-life patrons with his operatic villai ns. He unwittingly abetted the gathering revolutionary ferment with his William Tell, which opened in Paris in 1829 and provided a musical model for national liberation struggl es . The excitement of the famous overture, the overall length (nearly six hours ), and the emphasis on large choral ensembles -a ll lent a por­ tentous air to the work. The William Tell overture was to be played at the last meeting of the radical circle to which the youthful Dostoevsky belonged in 1849. Orsini's spectacula r attempt to assassi­ nate Napoleon III a decade later occurred outside the Paris opera while the orchestra was pla ying that same prelude to liberation. Two decades later, a French revolutionary on trial in Switzerland explained that his model was Tell, whose \"arrow whistles the music of Rossini .\" 37 The tenor who sang the lead in the original production was permanently radicalized by the experie nce-le ading the singing of La Marseillaise atop the barricades during the Revolution of 1830 with sword in hand and cherishing thereafter the vision of a world where \"an upheaval would be nothing more than a concert.\" 3 8 The revolutions in France and Belg ium in 1830 were highly the atri­ cal : the sudden exits and entrances of kings, the processions and pag­ ea ntry of volunteer arm ies, and the festive spirit of Paris and Brussels. Revolution seemed to be moving from the stage to the street-or perhaps the street was merely reclaiming what it had previously given to the stage . The extravagant melodramas of Nodier's protege, Victor Hugo, had in many ways anticipated the revolution . The premiere of Hernani on February 25, 1830, was in effect the opening political demonstration of the year. The tale of an outlaw strugg ling for love and liberation against fate , hate , and the Hapsburg est ablishment aroused the student audienc e. The red vest defiantly sported by Hugo's supporters anticipated the revolutionary red flag which was soon to be"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"----- - -- - - --- -- -- - 1 5 6 T HE D oMIN ANCE OF THE N ATIONAL R EVOLUTIONARIES raised in the open-a ir theater of Paris ; and the anti-traditional beat of Hugo's poetry fed nat urally into innumerable operatic amplific ations of his plays .39 In Brussels, the theatrical cata lyst was yet another anti-Hapsburg opera : The Mute Girl of Portici by Da niel-Fran<;ois Auber. In this tale of a seventeenth-c entury Ne apolitan insurrection, choral scenes of begga rs and shopkeepers swirled around the arresting figure (taken over from popula r pantomi me ) of a dumb heroine. The melodrama had been proscribed in Brussels after the July Revolution in Paris ; but the defiant Belgians demanded that it be restored to the repertoire soon after they were asked to honor the birthday of the Dutch king on August 24. After lengthy discussion of cuts , a perf ormance was reluctantly approved for August 25-a long with secret orders for stand-by troops. During the perform ance, the police chief of Brussels sent a boy out to conduct reconnaissance among the mob that had gathered outside. The informer returned to report rumors that the chief was to be as­ sassinated in his box.4 0 At the end of the fourth act, many people left the theater as if in sea rch of their own ending for the revolutionary melodrama. By the time the opera ended with a pyrotechnic onstage eruption of Mount Vesuvius (ma king spectacular use of new sound and color effects ), the lava of revolution was already coursing through the streets of Brussels. Wealthy members of the audience were unable to get out of the theater and into their carri ages. Soldiers and police were un able to keep up with (let alone contain ) t he movements of the mob in search of symbols of authority to burn and destroy. Thu s, an operatic perform ance triggered the revolution that led to Belgian independence in 1830. Later popular uprisings in Belgium were formed in the knowledge of this bizarre fact. Risings in 1834 were built around demands for another revival of the Auber oper a, while later perturbations in Ghent were triggered by a gala perform ance of William Tell at which the student audience confronted the Duke and Duchess of Brabant.41 The program to prevent the spread of revolution into Germany in 1830 involved prohibiting perform ances of The Mute Girl and William Tell in cities close to the French or Belgian borders .4 2 But the fears of those in power became the fascination of those who were not. Continent-wide efforts to restrict the rights of assembly for politica l purposes after 18 30 increased the covert political content of theatrical perform ances. A recurring theme of the new grand opera which spread out from Paris after 1830 was national uprisi ngs : Druids versus Romans in Bellini's Norma (M ilan, 1831 ), conspirators ass assinating a king in Auber's Gus­ tav III (Paris, I 833 ), persecuted Protestants against aristocratic royalists in both Bel lini's Puritans (Pa ris, 1835) and Meyerbeer's Huguenots (Paris, 1836); Jew versus Christians in Meyerbeer's The ]ewess (Paris , 1835) and versus Babylonians in Ver di's Nabucco. The premiere of this latter work in Milan on March g, 1842, brought Giuseppe Verdi into the center of the rea l-life dram a of Italian uni­ fication. Verdi, whose very name was to become an acronym for Italian nationalism (Vittorio Emmanuele Re d'Ital ia), struck a deep vein of"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"National vs. Social Revolution 1 57 anti-Austrian sentiment with this operatic tale of bondage to King Neb­ uchadnezzar. The uproar at the end of the first act surprised and fright­ ened the composer, who was seated in the orchestra. The prolonged standing ovation he received at the final curtain-f rom the orchestra as well as the audience-removed all doubt that he had suddenly be­ come a culture hero for the risorgimen to . The chorus of captive Jews from the third act Va pensiero (Fly, my thoughts, on golden wings to the fat her land ) had to be resung on the spot at the premiere. Massed mourners at Verdi's public funeral in Milan were spontaneously to sing it again nearly sixty years later. It was to become a kind of informal national anthem , with its lush lingering melody calling for the deliver­ ance of \"my beautiful but lost fatherla nd.\" Nabucco was followed in 1843 by a second patriotic opera, The Lam­ bards at the First Crusade, with another chorus of liberation (\"Today the Holy Land shall be ours !\" ), which also had to be resung at the premiere.43 Verdi turned next to an operatic version of Hernani. Melo­ dramatic operas of struggle casca ded from Verdi's pen in the remaining years leading up to the Revolution of 1848: Joan of Arc ( 1845), Attila (18 46 ), The Robbers (18 47), and finally, The Battle of Legnano, first produced amidst great excitement in January 1849 in Rome just 12 days before the esta blishment of the short-lived Roman Republ ic.4 4 Verdi subsequ ently returned to Victor Hugo for his Rigoletto of 1851 (ba sed on Le Roi S'Amuse ); and escalat ed to virtual onstage revolution in his Sicilian Vespers (Paris, 1855). The political censorshi p required a change in title for the first Italian perform ance the following year; and pop­ ular revolt against the doge of Venice dominated Simone Bocca negra, which opened in Venice in 1857. Verdi's rewriting of Auber's regicidal Gustav III as The Masked Ball was hea vily censored and first produced in Rome (after the setting was moved from Europe to distant Boston ) in 1859 on the eve of the decisive war of liberation against Austria. At that crucial point in Italian history, even Verdi's apolitical operas seemed to be mobilized. Cavour entered the key battle against the Ha psburgs in April 1859, humming the famed tenor air from Il Trova­ tore : \"Di Quella Pira.\" 4\" The essential mess age that nationa l revolu­ tionaries found in Verdi was that of the Roman envoy speaking to the conquering Hun in the first act of Attila : \"Take the univer se, but leave me Italy.\" 4 6 There were operatic echoes among social as well as national revolu­ tionar ies. Buon arroti gave singing lessons throughout his career, and his colla borator in both musical and revolutiona ry activity, Luigi An­ geloni, turned from his doctoral disserta tion on the origins of musical notation to writing about opera.47 Buon arroti's Flemish protege, Jacob Kats, wrote the strugg le song from Meyerbeer's Robert le Diable into his revolutionary drama The Earthly Paradise 48 and created the first Flemish theater for popular music and drama in Bru sse ls.4 9 That su­ preme symbol of international social revolution, Michael Bak unin, bade his friends farewell with the chorus of assassins from the Huguenots ,\"o and drew on the text of the fourth movement of Bee thoven's Ninth Symphony (Schiller's Ode to Joy) to call his followers \"beautiful daugh-"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"1 5 8 THE DOMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES ters of the divine spark.\" On Palm Sunday, 1849, in Dresden, he rushed forward after hearing Wagner conduct to announce that that movement would be exempted from destruction in the forthcoming revolutionary upheaval.\"l Whether or not Bakunin provided part of the model for Wagner's Siegfried, the bear-like Russian suggested to many that a general \"downfall of the gods\" was imminent in life as well as operatic fancy. Songs and Flags Musical militance burst out of the opera houses after 1830 in a flood of song and verse. This \"trumpet blast that suddenly rouses a vast camp of nations in arms\" 52 led to a profusion of national anthems and banners in imitation of La Marseillaise and the tricolor of the original French Revolution. Louis Philippe adopted and ostentat iously led the singing of La Mar­ seillaise as a means of securing his precarious hold on power.\": 1 The tenor Nourrit and the composer Berlioz led the singing of it on the Paris barricades with a sword and pistol respect ively as a baton.5 4 Rou­ get de Lisle, the all-but-forgotten author of the great anthem, hailed Berlioz as \"the Vulcan of revolution,\" 55 and was freed from prison by donations from the radical songwriter Jean-Pierre Beranger, who de­ scribed his protest singing as a \"tambour social a ouvrir la marche et marquer le pas. \" G G The new Marseillaise of 1830 was the \"Parisie nne,\" which Lafayette sang onstage with Nourrit at the end of the public theatrical per­ formance that followed his introduction of the new king to the Paris masses at the Hotel de Ville.\"7 Its composer, Casimir Delavigne, had contributed a melodram a, The Sicilian Vespers, to the unrest of 1819- 20; and he soon added to this stirring march for victorious Paris, words to a martial air of Kurpinski for the martyred Poles, the \"Varsovie nne,\" which became in many ways the Marseillaise for all defeated national­ ities . The Belgian Revolution of 1830 produced the \"Braban<;:onne,\" which became the national anthem; and the Franco-German crisis of 18 39-40 produced a proliferation of nationalistic airs, such as \"Watch on the Rhine\" and \"Deutschland, Deutschland iiber alles,\" adapted to Haydn's music and destined to become the future German national anthem .5 8 The national song, of course, had its accompanying flag. In some cases, the song was about the flag (the Romanian \"Tricolor,\" \"The Star Span­ gled Banner\" ). \"9 In some, it was simply identified with a banner : La Mar seillaise with the tricolor, which became the official flag of France after 1830. To the fourteen-year-old Eugene Pottier, the future author of the \"Intern ationale,\" the tricolor was \"the signal of happiness\" when first raised over Paris in July 1830. 60 Each nation suddenly seemed to feel the need for some such signal. A true nation was now thought to require a tricolor-freed of all crosses, crowns, and heraldic reminders"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"National vs. Social Revolution 1 59 of traditional authority and civic inequality. The first creative act of the Belgian revolution aries after leaving the opera house in Brussels was the crude fashioning of a new banner out of curtains ripped down from the gutted office of the hated editor of Le National. t>l The three ver­ tical stripes of the black, yellow, and red of Brabant were identified with the \"Brabanc;:onne \" and immediately raised over the Hotel de Ville in Brussels. 6 2 Like the Belgian, the Italian tricolor (green, white, red) had made its debut in the revolutionary era. The revolutionary legion in Italian Lom­ ba rdy blazoned on their tricolor \"equality or death\" and \"victory or death.\" 6 3 The Hungarian na tional movement began to gather in the I84os around its own tricolor of red, white, and green .e4 Romanian nat ionalists threw up a vertical tricolor of blue, yellow, and red, which became the flag and inspired the anthem \"Tricolor\" when Romania joined the unrest of I848. The black, red, and gold banner was a central symbol of the Ham­ bacher Fest of May I832. Local colors were swept away by youthful enthusiasm for three-colored cockades and sashes bearing the legend \"Germany's Resurrection .\" 65 Following the impulse for radical simpli fication, some demonstrators called for \"only one color.\" 66 However, the idea of one unifying color was most fully developed by social revolutionaries in their search for a banner to rival the tricolors of national revolutionari es. \"Our flag can no longer be contained by the sky of France,\" the visionary prophets of universal social change, the Saint-Simoni ans , had sung.67 Their mis­ sion was to \"unfold in the breeze the battle standard of the workers ... serve the universe as a tor ch.\" cs Workers themselves began to provide a real-life banner for this Saint­ Simonian fantasy. Having gained few tangible benefits from the revolu­ tions of I83o, they brought out colors of their own in urban demon­ strat ion s. In Rei ms, the black flag (w hich was later to become the banner of anarch ism ) made its modern French debut, when on Janu ary IS, I 83 I, unemployed dirt carriers bore a flag of mourning through the streets with the slogan, \"Work or Death !\" 69 The futu re banner of international revolution , the red flag, made its modern debut in Paris during riots and demonstrations after the funeral of a popular general, Max imilien Lamarque, on June 5, 1832 .70 In a nocturnal scene worthy of his own melodram as, Victor Hugo unfurled the red flag that night on the barricades in the Rue de la Ch anverie and lit a torch beside it, which, in his words, added \"to the scarlet of the flag I don't know what kind of sinister purple .\" n The demonstration of June 5 has been called \"the first disturbance that was simultaneously both republican and social.\" 72 It was organized by republican agitators in the wake of the trial of \"the fifteen\" -Blanqui and his associates. The red flag, which had been used as a sign of martial law and a signal of alarm during the original French Revolution, was thus revived by a new set of republicans amidst the cholera epidemic of 1832.

Songs and flags helped enlist the emotions and politicize the illiterate. If system­ atic ideology was not part of revolutionar y nationalism, this concept of \"the people\" was central to it. As a counter to ration alism, evocation of \"the people\" goes back at least to Rousseau's quarrel with the elitist philosophes of Paris. Bonne­ ville in 1787 had warned the aristocratic Condorcet of the coming of the Peuple-Roi,19 and had written songs about the peuple-fr ere,8o while Cloots had proclaimed \"THE INFALLIBILITY OF THE PEOPL E.\" 81 By the I 83os, romantic revolutionaries were speaking almost rou­ tinely of le peuple, das Volk, il popolo, narod, or lud as a kind of regen­ erative life force in human history. The new monarchs who came to power after the Revolutions of 1830, Louis Philippe and Leopold I, sought the sanction of \"the people\" as king \"of the French\" and \"of the Bel­ gians,\" rather than of France or Belgium. Even the reac tion ary Tsar Nicholas I, three years after crushing the Polish uprising of r830- 31, proclaimed that his own authority was based on \"nationality\" (as well as autocracy and Orthodoxy )-and his word narodnost' also mea ning \"spirit of the people\" was copied from the Polish narodowosc. \"The people\" was a different concept for revolutionary nationalists than for evolutionary liberals (who thought of specific propertied groups to whom the franchise and civic liberties might be extended ), or for social revolutionaries (who thought of an industrial proletariat that might provide fresh fuel for revolution ). For romantic national ists, \"the people\" was simply the source of legitimacy for the exercise of sov­ ereign power in the moder n nation-state. Its sanction was gained not by the prosaic counting of parlia mentary or class divisi ons, but by the poetic invocation of a forgotten inner unity.

High priest of this new religion of \"the people\" was Jules Miche­ let. Da zzled by the spontaneous mass action of the 1830 revolution in Paris, he published an Introduct ion to Universal History in 1831 as a prelude to his ma ssive epic , The History of France, on which he spent most of his next forty years . To Michelet, France was \"not only a nation, but a gre at political prin­ ciple,\" 82 vague enough to include both of \"our two great redempti ons, by the Holy Maid of Orleans and by the Revolut ion .\" 83 The revolution had opened up a \"second period\" of God's presence on earth. \"His in­ carnation of '89\" 84 in France would lead to the resurrection of all peo­ ples. The liberation of the masses during the July days was a foretaste of that \"eternal July\" yet to come. The spontaneous development of popular unity and popular institutions from July 1789 to July 1790 made the popular festival of federal unity on the first annivers ary of the fall of the Bastille more important than the original event itself. From being \"friends of the people\" (the leading republican society of 1830-32), radicals soon sought to become the servants thereof. \"In the presence of the sovereignty of the people, you must all bow your fore­ heads into the dust,\" Voyer D' Argenson told the Chamber of Deputies during a dispute over symbols of authority with the Gu ardian of Seals in 1834.8 5 In the same year, one of the leading former advocates of a Catholic revival under papal leadership, Lamennais, celebrated what was to be his final break with Rome. He retreated to Brittany, shed his cleric al collar, and published his passionate and apocalyptical testa­ ment to the simple people of Europe as the suffering servant of God : Words of a Believer. This immensely influential tract directly inspired Mazzini's Faith and the Future of 1835, which he considered his best wor k.86 Lamennais's Book of the People (18 37) went still further in glorifyin g \"the people\" as \"the poor, the weak, the oppres sed.\" 8 7 He excited imitators into writing a Marseillaise of the People, Reign of the People, and Gospel of the People .88 It seemed not too much to contend that-in the words of a song of the period-\"the people ... is God.\" 8 9 For Michelet the people was both plebs and populos, both the humble toilers and the spiritual unity of the nation.9 o In his view England was a great empire, but a weak people. Only a people can become a nat ion ; indeed \"a nat ion is a people that has become a person .\" 91 The En­ glish were a kind of antipeopl e, dedicated to power and prospe rity with­ out love and frie ndship ; they were sca vengers who have \"profited from the entr'acte between the two religions (Catholic and Revolution ary ).\" 92 Beyond France, Michelet looked for vindic ation to Poland and invited as lectu rer to the College de France perhaps the greatest of all poetic prophets of revolutionary nationalism : Adam Mickiew icz. The crushing of the Polish Revolution was for the poet a crucifixion of the \"Christ among nations.\" In his last lecture at the College in 1842, he con­ tended that a messi anic mission had been imparted to three peopl es : the ancient Israeli tes , the Fre nch , and now the Slavs. Mickiewicz rega rded Poland's temporary dest ruction twice in one life-"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"162 T HE D OMINANCE OF THE N ATIONAL R EVOLUTIONARIES time as a sacrificial offering for the sins of others, necessary to save the peoples of the world. By submitting itself to partition during the French Revolution , Poland had saved revolutionary France from con­ certed action by the monarchs of Europe. Likewise the Polish rising of I83o, inspired by a sense of fraternity with events in France and Bel­ gium, preven ted-ev en in defeat-Nicholas I from restoring the power of his wife's uncle, King William of the Netherla nds. Intoxicated with the outbreak of a third wave of revolution in I848, Mickiewicz tried to organize a Polish legion to lead the final liberation of Poland and all mankind. Like Lamartine in France and Pet 8 fi in Hun­ gary, he was a great vernacular poet destined to mount the barricades amidst a popular upsurge. The transfer of the revolution ary cause from Franco-Italian conspirators to an international fraternity of romantic na­ tionalists is illustrated by Mickiewicz's plural version of the old Babeu­ vist tit le , Tribun des Peuples of I84g.93 Already in the I83o s the Poles had assumed a certain leadership in internationalizing revolutionary nationali sm. Arriving in Paris in great numbers after the failure of the Polish Revolution in I83I they or­ ganized innumerable protest meetings and petitions against repression by the German as well as the Russian governmen t.94 Mickiewicz and others expected a German revolution throughout I 832-33 that might lead to guerrilla uprisings and the liberation of Poland.9 \" On Novem­ ber 3, 1832, many Poles addressed a proclamation of solidarity to the Jews as another persecuted nation in exile.9n Mickiewicz died in Istan­ bul in November I855, in the arms of a Jewish friend who had his own proto-Zionist dream of liberating Jerusalem. By the end of I832, the Polish radicals in Paris had formed a group of I ,500-2,ooo (later known as the Democratic Society 97) to organize popular revolution, not only in Poland but also in the surrounding regions where national aspirations were being repressed by the Haps­ burgs and Romanovs. Young Poland became one of the largest sections of Mazzini's Young Europe. When restrictions in Paris became tighter after I834, the Poles blazed the trail of further revolutionary migration to Brussels and then London (the trail followed by Marx). Of the 4,380 political refugees known to have been in England in I853, 2,500 were Polish.9 8 The dominant figure in the Polish emigration was Mickiewicz's former history professor, Joachim Lelewel. Head of the Revolutiona ry Patriotic Society during the insurrection of November 1830 in Warsaw, Lelewel had spoken on July 27, I83I, at the first in a long series of gatherings in Paris to commemorate the Polish uprisi ng.99 For Lelewel as for Miche­ let the revolution ary potential of the oppressed people lay not in their material desperation but in the spiritual richness of their communal feelings. \"The classes which we call inferior and which follow instinct more closely,\" said Michele t, \"are for that very reason eminently ca­ pable of action, ever ready to act. \" 1 o o Lelewel gradually came to believe in the capacity of the Slavic peasant masses to accom p lish what the Russian empire would not, and the Polish aristocracy could not, do: free the captive Slavic nations.

Both men felt redeemed by their own historical contact with the ordinary people of the past; both compared their profession as historians to the hard but wholesome work of the ordinary laborer ; both urged that the we althy and wise should seek out \"mixed marri ages\" with poor and simple people to unify the nation. 102 Michelet glorified the fishermen of Normandy for forming a \"moral union\" that looked beyond mere economic interest and helped lead men from \"the natural associ ation of family ... to the grand association, that of our native country.\" 1 o s Lelewel saw the commun al agrarian institutions of the early Slavs serving the same function. The revolt of I 846 in Cracow inspired the Polish Democratic Society to plan rapidly (if vainly) for a general levee en masse of the entire Polish peasa ntry. The Polish uprising inspired even the British working class, 10 4 and provided the first hint of the national uprisings that were to become epidemic in I 848. The Slavs' answer to the national congresses of I 848, held in Frank­ furt by the Germans and in Budapest by the Hunga ria ns, was the pan­ Slav congress of Prague convened in the Bohemian Na tional Museum by the romantic Czech hist orian Frantisek Palacky. Like so many revo­ lutionary nationalist gatherings of that era, the Prague congress pro­ vided the precedent and the symbols for the conse rvative chauvinism of a future generation of imperial politici ans. 10 5 At the same time, how­ ever, the activities of Bakunin, the dominant Russian representative, revealed that the revolutiona ry belief in the liberating power of \"the p eople\" was moving farther to the left as it moved farther to the east. Ha ving already set forth in a French journal in Janu ary I845 a fluent sta tement of faith in the revolutiona ry potential of the Russia n peasan­ try, 10 6 in December I848 Bakunin published an \"Appeal to the Slavs,\" urging alliance with revolutionary Hungary and Germany in a \"gen­ eral federation of European republ ics.\" 1o 1 Revolutionary populism-no less than reactionary imperial pan­ slavism- developed from the intellectuals' fantasy of an unspoiled peo­ ple who longed to be liberated and who offered in turn moral liberation in their midst. In the wa ke of I848 populism developed slowly out of the writings of Alexander Herzen and Bakunin, the two leading Russian participants in the events of that year in wes tern Europe. But it was Michelet who fortified radical nationalism with the kind of antireligious humanism that Russia n revolutionaries were to find congeni al,l os His The People of I 846 was a revolutiona ry enconium to plebeian France . When the French Revolution of 1848 failed, Miche­ let looked east again to Poland for a popular revolution in his Poland and Russia of I85I . In reply, Herzen wrote his famous \"Open Letter to"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"16 4 T HE D OMINANCE OF THE N ATIONAL R EVOLUTIONARIES Michelet,\" insisting that the Russian people with their communal land­ holding and adjudic ation truly carried the germ of revolutionary re­ generation for Eur ope. 1 0H Michelet looked more sympathetically at Rus­ sia in his Democratic Legends of the North of 1854, but attached even greater hopes to the Da nubian Revolution in Hung ary and Roma nia. l1 0 Romania became in 1859 the first new nation to emerge from a revo­ lutionary struggle in Europe since Belgium in 1830. Its revolutiona ry movement represented the convergence of Italian, Polish, and French influenc es. There was, first of all, the same echo of Mazzini that had also been heard in the 184os in such far corners of Europe as Ireland and Norway. \"Young Dacia\" and \"Young Romania\" 1 11 appeared in the Danubian region where the three multinational empir es- Ottoman, Aus­ trian, and Russian- converged . The lonely bearers of Latin culture in eas tern Europe were to develop a new historical consciousness of them­ selves as heirs to the ancient Roman province of Dac ia. The his torian Nicolae Balcescu went to study with Michelet in Paris ,11� and orga­ nized the most important of many national revolutionary organizatio ns : Fratia (Bro therho od ) .1 1 3 He edited a nameless wee kly and organized secret ten-man cells under a three-man director ate. The militant struc­ ture required total obedience to the deacon or priest who catechized the individual member. A militant strategy for national revolt was sug­ gested in Balcescu's massive historical study of I 844 : Armed Power and Military Art from the Setting up of the Wallachian Principality to our Times. \"Justice and Brotherhood\" was their motto and their image of what a national struggle against a foreign power could achieve. In 1846, translations from Michelet's The People and the outbreak of the Polish upheaval in Cracow began to bring the Mazzinian ideal into revolutionary reality within Rom ania. Balcescu went over to the slogan \"father land, brotherhood, and libert y,\" and gave first priority to achiev­ ing \"unity of ideas and feelings which in time, shall bring about politi­ cal unification .\" 11 4 During the unsuccessful national revolution of 1848-49, Balcescu pub­ lished a new journal The Sovereign People, fleeing thereafter to Paris and London, where he represented Romania on Mazzini's European Democratic Central Committee .1 1 5 The tricolor banner which had been proclaimed for revolutionary Romania in June 1848 (red, yellow, and blue with the slogan \"Justice-Fr aternity\" ) became the flag of a new nation when the two principal provi nces, Moldavia and Wallachia for­ ma lly united to form independent Romania in Janua ry 1859. The idea of \"the people\" penetrated into the vast Russian empire in a way that illustrates the ambiguity of this romantic concept. Nicholas I invoked the term narodnost' more in its narrow meaning of \"nation­ ality\" than in its broad sense of \"spirit of the peop le.\" In combating the Ottoman Empire , which he did in the years from the war of 1828- 29 to the Crimean War of 1853, Nicholas I found an oppressed \"people\" to liberate : the Orthodox Slavs under the Moslem Tur ks.

But the vag ueness of belief in \"the people\" and the danger of conflict between one people and another did not diminish the idea lism and high expectations of national revoluti onaries. Despite the failures of 1848-49, romantic nationalism remained the dominant revolutionary faith throughout the 185os. Michelet remained the prophet, Poland the hope, and Mazzini the heart and soul. As with Michelet and Lelewel , \"the people\" was for Ma zzini a spiritual for ce-not something to be divided up into interests or classes. In his first journal for the working cla ss, Apostolate of the People (the weekly of his Workingmen's Associ ation which he founded in 1840 ), Ma zzini published the first four parts of his most famous work, The Duties of Man. The stress on moral obligat ion was also evident in the slogan he placed over the ma sthead of a later journal for Italian worke rs : \"Mor­ ality, Fatherland, Labor.\" 11 7 He dreamed throughout the I 84os that a \"council of ma nkind\" might issue a declarat ion of principles to supersede French-type declar ations of rights . 1 1 8 This stress on ethical rather than ma terial imperatives is apparent in his last attempt at a nationalist Internati onal : the Interna­ tional Associ ation of 1855-59· Mazz ini org anized this effort in London, where he had returned after serving in the ruling triumvir ate of the short-lived Roman Republic in 1849. He sought to fortify his old faith in a \"third Rome\" of \"the people\" replacing the earlier Romes of em­ perors and popes. He now argued that a broader \"alliance of the peo­ ples\" was about to be formed by the three gre at \"peoples\" of Europe (the Slavs, Germ ans, and \"Gallo-Rom ans\" ) to renew the common struggle. 11 9 But the I86os dest royed the dream forever. Italy was unified not by the passion of Maz zini but by the realpolitik of Cavour, \"the prose trans­ lation of his poem.\" 120 Poland rose and was crushed aga in in 1863 ; and Germ any chose Einheit rather than Freiheit as it achieved unity under Bisma rck's rule of \"blood and iron .\" All this was accomp anied by war and bloodshed never envisaged by rom antic nation alists, who had dreamed of a conflict-free family of na­ tion s. The vern acular poets and national historians who were the \"ideol­ ogists\" of nationalism always assumed that the only national war would be that of peoples aga inst kings. The faith in national revolution remained dominant throughout the I8sos. But the rise of the rival tradition of social revolution had already been for esh adowed in the appearance of deep and conscious class con­ flict during the revolutions of 1848. Paralleling the emergence of the red flag as a rival to the tricolor was the increasing substi tution of ouvriers for peuple in Paris during May and June of 1848. 1 2 1 If the new class terminology was most evident in the petitions and songs that di-"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"166 THE D oMINANCE OF THE N ATIONAL R EVOLUTIONARIES rectly reached the masses , the new ideas of social revolution were de­ veloped by a small, apostolic succession of elite intellectuals who took their torch from the hands of the aged Buona rroti. Revo lutionary Violen ce: The !tala-Polish Cont ribution Before going on to the social revolutionary tradition, it is necessa ry to consider the introduction of violence into revolution ary practice by na­ tional revolutionarie s. There were anticipations of a distinctively new approach to violence in both the American 122 and the French 1 23 rev­ olutio ns. In a broad sense as we have seen, the national revolutionary tradition arose in a period of almost continuous wa r from the mass ive monarchical assault on France in I 792 to the final defeat of Napoleon by a coalition of national resistance movemen ts. The French provided the preceden t; the English , distant support; and the Germ ans, ideas . But the dedicated cadres who combined practice with theory came largely from Italy and Poland. The Italo-Polish period of revolutionary violence lasted until the suc­ cessful unification of Italy and �he defeat of the last Polish rebellion in the early 186os. Thereafter, a very different tradition of revolutiona ry violence emerged-primarily in Russia and among social revolutionar­ ies. The two types naturally overlapped and, in the early twentieth cen­ tury, converged in the Balkan no-man's-land of European politi cs. The shooting of the Hapsburg Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo in July 1914 led to World War I and to the new age of total war and totali­ tarian peace. That fateful ass assination was to be the work of a move­ ment inspired by both Italian and Russian revolutionari es . The difference was that Ha lo-Polish viole nce , parochial in aim, was heroic in style . Russian viole nce, universal in aim, was rationalistic and ascetic in style. The Russian story is well known. The tale of Halo­ Polish revolutionary violence has, however, been generally overlooked. Almost all modem ideas on guerril la tactics or wars of \"national lib­ eration\" have antecedents if not origins in forgotten writings by national revolutionaries from these two nation s. The originality of Italy and Poland derived paradoxically from their fanatical dedication to repli­ cating and perpetuating the revolutionary example of France. It was in 1794, as the Terror reached its peak in Paris, that the mo dern theory of revolutionary violence began to emerge in places dis­ tant from that capital. In that year, the young Buonarroti esta blished within his revolutionary rule in Oneglia a special school to teach \"the theory of revoluti on.\" At the same time, in Warsaw, there was a large­ sca le uprising against the final partition of Poland which included scythe-bearing partisans. Survivors of the insurrection formed a legion of liberation in Italy which grew within a year to ten thousand, and began the long linkage between the two national revolutionary tradi­ tions . Fighting with the French in Italy, the Poles dreamed of an even­ tual return \"from Italy to Poland\" ; and their song later became the Polish national anthemJ 24"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"National vs. Social Revolution The wounded leader of the defeated Polish upnsmg, Tadeusz Kos­ ciuszko, saw the liberation of Pola nd opening the \"epoch of general pacificat ion\" to end all human conflict. l2 5 In exile, he developed the charact eristic belief that revolutionary violence would end all other violen ce. In r8oo, he published Can the Poles recover their indepen­ dence by armed action ? 1 2 6 and answered affirmatively that \"a people which aspires to independence must absolutely have faith in its own arms.\" 127 The combination of militance and self-reliance forced upon the Poles by history guarantees, in effect, that a new quality of man and nation will emerge. Kosciuszko had drawn on eight years of experience in the American Revolution and on the indigenous Polish trad ition of Cossack -influe nced resistance to earlier Swedish and Russian incursi ons.1 2 8 He focused on the key unanswered question arising from the Polish experience of 17 94: How can a popular army combat supe rior conventional military for ces ? The Poles had simultaneously confronted the armies of the three most pow erful conse rvative powers in Europ e: Russia, Prussia, and Austria. He was impr essed that, despite the impossibility of victory, susta ined mass resistance had taken place. Morale had been a facto r, but even in purely military terms, a sma ll insurrectiona ry army could neutralize a much larger convention al force by simply refusing to fight in traditional terms. Kosciuszko may have been the first to use the term \"little war\"; 1 29 but his substa ntial contributions to the American army lay in the relatively conventional areas of designing fortifications for West Point and writing the first milit ary manual for the horse artillery . 1 30 In Europe, he uni­ vers alized the struggle for nationhood by denouncing Na poleon as the foe of \"every great nationality and still more the spirit of indepen­ den ce.\" 13 1 But memory of the resistance movement he had led con­ tinued to dominate the Polish imagination ; and, four years after his death in r8r7 , the Polish Patriotic Society was formed with the secret name League of Scythebearers. l 3 2 The most important writings on revolution ary violence in the r82os were by the Italians in the aftermath of their unsuccess ful uprisin gs. At the forefr ont were the members of the Apofasimeni or desperate soldiers, formed by veterans of the Spanish, Italian, and Greek up­ heavals. They perpetuated the Carbonari's secret, hierarc hical organi­ zation, subs tituting the military term tent ( tende ) for shop in describing the local unit .l33 The initiation ceremonies placed an almost ma sochistic emphasis on viol ence. After a centurion had washed away the servile past of each new member with two ritual drops of wa ter and baptized him as \"the terror of tyra nts,\" 1 34 the neophyte asked-on his knees with his left hand on his heart and right hand on a dagger-f or punishment if he should ever betray any of his vows : I wish that my eyes be pulled from head, my tongue ripped from my mouth, my body cut and torn little by litt le; that my bowels be pulled out; that corros ive poison may eat at me with pain-with spasms of the ches t , lungs and stomach bringing even sha rper pain .... 1 35"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"1 68 T HE D OMINANCE OF THE N ATIONAL R EVOLUTIONARIES And after this process, the traitor to the Apofasimeni was to be quartered, and his remains put on display with the label : \"Here was justly punished the infamous --- .\" 1 3 6 The first theoretical reflections on revolutionary violence among Ital­ ians occu rred as the nonviolent agitation of the Carbonari escalated into unsuccessful milit ary confrontation with Ha psburg power in 1820- 21. Buonarrotfs associates took the lead. Prati suggested in 1821 organizing a guerrilla-type wa r using Genoa as a base or \"point of action for the Liberals of Italy.\" 1 37 The Spanish Constitution of 1812 like the Spanish resistance movement was seen as the model for national resistance to a foreign oppressor _ I ss As the Italian movement was collapsing, Luigi Angeloni wrote a series of letters on the problem of violence which were later published in London as On Force in Political Affairs . Procl aiming that \"all is force in the universe,\" he cited Hobbes's gloomy view of human nature (a rare authority for revolutionari es ) ,139 and found hope only in the struggle that lay ahead between \"artificial\" and \"natural\" force . l4 0 The former, expressed politically through hereditary privil ege, must eventually suc­ cumb to the latter, which is based on popular sovereignty rooted in ma­ jority rule. Italians after the failures of 1820-2 1 (like Poles after their setbacks in 1830- 31 ) tended to substitute the distant example of the American Revolution, however little unders tood, for the tarnished model of Franc e. Angeloni cited the American Revolution as the purest example of \"natural for ce,\" and the Monroe Doc trine as an indication that this natural force may be turning from a \"minor force\" into the \"major\" force in the world. 1 4 1 Angeloni's work impressed his old colleague Buona rroti as he was pre­ paring to publish his History of the all-bu t-forgotten Babeuf conspiracy ; and also interested other Italians exiled with Buon arro ti in Belgium. 1 4 2 Both Angeloni and Buona rroti influenced in turn the most extensive and original treatise yet to appea r on irregular revolution ary wa rfare : the two-volume On the War of National Insurrection by Bands applied to Italy by Count Carlo Bianco di Sai nt-Jori oz.I43 Bianco had been active in the revolu tion ary struggle in Piedmont during 1820, and had journeyed to Paris in an unsuccessful effort to coordinate the Italian struggle with other European movemen ts. Re­ turning empty-handed, he was captured and narrowly escaped a death sentence in Turin in 1821. He then led the \"Italian lancers\" in Spain, stayed on to fight the royalist French troops there in 1822- 23, fought briefly for Greek independe nce, and played a leading role in the Apofasimeni before beginning a life of permanent exile in Gibraltar, Malta, Corsic a, Algeria, London, and Brussels .144 Thus, his treatise of 1830 was the summary and synthesis of a decade of active experience -and at the same time an anticipation of the final flurry of violent revo­ lutionary activity that he was about to undertake in Lyon in Febru ary 1831, and in Ma zzini's efforts to invade and inspi ie revolution in Savoy in 18 3 1 and 1834.1 4 5 Bianco's treatise urged Italy to reject timid political philosophers"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"National vs. Social Revolution 1 6 9 \"more foreign than Italian,\" in favor of a \"strong, robust and ardent\" political-military mobilization for \"national insurrection,\" such as took place in the United States after \"their stupendous swift revoluti on.\" 1 4 6 He called for a nationwide network of guerrilla bands that would avoid dire ct combat but raid armorie s, seek camouflage , and deny the occupy­ ing Ha psburgs any local sustenance. 1 47 Gradually, areas were to be liberated, \"bands\" coalesced into \"flying columns\" and then into regular military formations with colo rs, uniform s, and Roman titles ( decurion, centurion, consul, tribu ne ) . 1 48 The insurrection was to produce a model for political orga nization through its military command structure (four provinc es, twenty congreg ations or cantons, and two hundred smaller units ). 1 49 The secret of success for a wa r of peoples rather tha n kings lay in the political and moral mobilization of the entire country. Arguing implicitly against the dominance of Parisian thinking in the revolutionary tradi­ tion, Bianco contended that the possession of a major-or even a capital -city is not important in the ear ly stages of a national insurrection. The real national war against the invader in Spain and Russia began after Mad rid and Moscow had fallen, 1 5 0 Capture of the capital-li ke the use of identifying uniforms and banners-would come later rather than early. It was important not to be corrupted by the big cities in the formative stages of a revolution ary movemen t. Rome itself was a \"clo aca\" of dishon esty; and large cities generally promoted \"a luxuriat­ ing and effeminate life.\" 1 51 The insurrection ary movement was thus seen as a kind of rural-based moral revival of the nation. Bian co's seven types of military movement prescribed a kind of corporate calisthenics for a people already sinking into la dolce vita. There was a sense of athletic adventure in Bianco's preference for light weapons, which put a premium on individual skill and intimate familiarity between man and implement : pikes and pitch­ for ks, the Spanish knife and the Italian pugnole. 1 5 2 Violence for Bianco (like \"artificial force\" for Angeloni ) was charac­ teristic only of react ionary states. Bianco (like most later apostles of revolutionary viole nce ) saw himself as a reluctant fighter for national liberation opposing the mercenaries of a degenerate empire. The latter alone fought per violenza, 1 53 Mazzini tried to put his insurrectional theory into practice, 1 54 but came to depend on emigre exhortation more than insu rrection ary action after the failures of the early thirtie s. Garibaldi would revive the notion of a partisan fighting group in the mid-fortie s; and the revolution ary failures of 1848-49 in Ita ly would inspire a return to violence in the fifti es-es pecia lly in the remarkable uprising led by Carlo Pisaca ne in 1857, from a ship he had kidnapped on the high seas. Prior to this, Pisacane had written a long st udy of the Italian Revolu­ tion of 1848-49. A military officer by profe ssion, he laid particular stress on the need for ideological motivat ion in revolution ary wa rfa re. The word concetto (conce pt) was distinguished from \"ste rile doctrines\" and became almost synonymous with \"revolution ary movement.\" 1 55 He called for \"the revolution of ideas which must always precede the rna-"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"17 0 T HE D m.nNANCE OF THE N ATIONAL R EvoLUTIONARIES terial revoluti on\" ; for an insurrectionary movement to spread \"from one extreme of Italy to the other with the rapidity of thought\" ; 156 and for a new type of militant distinguished from the old type of soldier : militi tutti, soldato nessuno.H\\1 Nat ionalism was \"enough for the ins ur­ rection, but not enough for victor y\"; so one must switch slogans \"from 'war to the foreigner' to 'wa r on the ruler.' \" 1 58 He envisaged a blend of Spanish and Russian anti-Napoleonic guer rilla tactics with the new class wa rfare of the workers of Lyon .159 Moral factors could de­ feat mat erial for ce; and \"poet ry\" would prevail over \"grammar\" as the revolution spread from the count ryside to the cities for final victory. l 6 0 The Poles became even more innova tive than the Ita lians in the use of revolutionary viol ence. They built on the almost mystical significance that Kosciuszko had attached to the link between peasa nt and scythe in the insurrection of 1794, 1 n1 and speculated subseq uently about using everything from fence posts and table knives to boiling water as weap­ ons for insurgence against traditional armie s. 1 6 2 They hoped, after their failed uprising of 1830- 31, that a chain reaction of revolutions else­ where would reverse the Russian suppression of Polish libert ies. But neither the French unrest of 1832 nor that of Germany in 1833, nor the second Italian campaign against Savoy in 1834 succeeded. One of the relatively moderate leaders of the Polish military uprising of 1830-3 1 had written a lengthy and radical call to arms, On Partisan Warfare, in Paris in 1835; 16 => and in the same year, a significant minority of the large Polish emigre popul ation split off from the Democratic Society to form the Polish People organization, which advanced even more com­ prehensive theories just ifying revolutionary viole nce. Within the Democratic Society, the most influential proponent of vio­ lence, Ludwik Mieroslawski, was born appropriately enough on a mili­ tary wagon in 1814. He had led uprisings in Sicily and Ba den as well as Poland, and by the 1830s was arguing that \"in a state of revolution , the whole country is transformed into a single communal property in the hands of the revolutionary gover nment.\" 164 He advocated \"salutary\" terrorism and mobilization of the peasa ntry for acts of viol ence, but still thought in terms of regular wa rfare aga inst the occupying powers­ concentrating against Russia. His ideas found reinforcement in an­ other Polish treatise drawn up in the same year in Pa ris : Partisan War­ fare as the type most convenient for resurgent natio ns.1 6 5 The Poles lent some of their milit ance to other national revolu t-i ons in 1848. J6zef Bern, author of the first modern treatise on rocketry, be­ came commander in chief of the military forces of the Hunga rian na­ tional army. 1G 6 But he saw the Hunga rian Revolution crushed by the bulwark of react ionary antinationalism , by troops from the same Rus­ sia that had besieged him in Gdansk in 1817 and destroyed the Polish insurrection in 1830-3 1 in which he had fought. The failure of the I 846 uprising in Poland and of the final uprising of 1863 brought to an end the Polish-Italian period of heroic insur­ rectionist teachin gs. Left behind to poste rity, however, was the largely overlooked legacy of the most original and prophetic of the Italo-Polish theorists of revolutionary viol ence, Henryk Kamienski. He so intensified"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"National vs. Social Revolution the myth of \"the people\" as to insist that national revolution was in­ sepa rable from social revolution \"because he who wishes to achieve his goal must will the means.\" 16 7 The means of re alizing true national independence and dignity was his strikingly modern concept of a \"peo­ ple's war.\" This concept was first set forth as the title of the third part of a tract published in Brussels in 1844, partially exemplified in the Cracow uprising that he helped lead in 1846, and fin ally perfected in his Peop le's War, published posthumously in 1866 after his long im­ prisonment and exile. A \"people's wa r\" differed from a partisan war which was seen by Kamienski as only a tactical form of struggling for \"auxili ary goals.\" A people's war was the totally just strugg le of a tota lly oppressed peo­ ple like the Pol es, involving a total mobilization \"in which the number of those fighting equals the numbers of inhabitants of the country.\" 168 The gentry who had long led Polish liberation movements must either re­ nounce all social privil ege and join the struggle or face punishment in­ cluding death. Factors of morale were more important than weapo ns ; and because the idea of a \"people's war\" was totally new, its leaders must be created in the struggle preferably among the peasa nts at the grass-roots level. They must be \"apostles\" of an egalitarian social trans­ formation as well as tactic ally skilled milita ry leaders. The image of the revolutionary spark was given a slightly more mod­ ern ring by the widely travelled Kamienski (who lived in Paris and Brussels after 1830, Russia in exile, and France and Algeria in emigra­ tion after 1846). Social revolution, he insisted, was \"the elect ric spark over the whole of Poland, set in motion by a magical power \" 1 69 that would arouse the masses to defeat any traditional means of force (and would free national movements in the future from their traditional de­ pendence on external aid or emigre leadership ). With great detail-and a consta nt emphasis on political and moral as well as military factors -Kamienski developed two separate outlines for a four -stage concept of people's war. Initial scattered uprisings would build confidence and organization while avoiding pitched battles with regular units. Then mobile detachments would begin action, gradu ally merging into larger units. His tactics always included flexible responses to the forms that opposition might take, so that the occupying power (and the vacillating gentry ) could never esta blish any enduring security. There is hardly a concept of modern, ideologic ally disciplined guerrilla warfare (includ­ ing trans-national solidarity even with the impoverished Russia ns ) that was not included in Kamienski's treatise, which in its final form was in­ tended for the leaders of the 1863 uprisi ng-but never reached them. The only important new theoretical writing of the immediate pre- 1863 period was Mieroslawski's Instructions to Insurgents of 1862, which en­ couraged the Poles to think in more traditional anti-Russian terms de­ spite such novel ideas as the use of armored cars, 1 7 0 Mieroslawski was a more traditional national ist, who had fought with Garibaldi and shared the Italians' gre at hopes for Na poleon III.

The Italian and Polish interest in milit ary action was a direct outcome of the military training and aroused expectations of the revolu­ tionary and Na poleonic eras. Italy in the south and Poland in the east of Europe had provided the earl iest, most consistent support of both revolutiona ry and Na poleonic Franc e. These nations continued to nur­ ture romantic hopes of ma terial or spiritual aid from France. Up risings had been looked upon as necessa ry responses to what Angeloni in the aftermath of I82o ca lled \"artificial force\" and Cabet in the aftermath of I83o called the \"system of violence\" 171 of the Holy Allian ce. The Ita lo-Polish dream of national insurrection was generally based on the expectation that revolutiona ry France would lead the way. A sense that Na poleon had left that path was what had led in I 8oo to the first revolutionary conspiracy to attack him by a Corsican and an Ita lian .172 Continued bitterness by Italians at the French rejection of their own revolutiona ry heritage had led to periodic violence in Paris, culminating in the most grisly assa ssinat ion attempt of the early nineteenth century by a Corsican Ita lian veteran of Na poleon's Russian campaign, Giuseppi Fieschi. In July I 835 (on the fifth anniversary of the Revolution of I83o), his improved version of the anti-Napoleonic \"infern al ma chine\" fired twenty-five guns simultaneously at King Louis Philipp e, k illing eighteen innocent bystanders and wounding scores more while missing its target altogether. l n Hope waned during the Second Empire of Na poleon III for another revolution in Fra nce ; and the inevitable violent Italian exp ression of un­ requited revolutionary love came, as we shall see, with Orsini's attempt to assassinate the French ruler in I858. Finally, when unification came in I8s g-6 I through wa r and diplomacy rather than heroic revolution , the dream of such revolution died in Italy. Polish revolutionary hopes were definitively crushed by the massive Russian repression of the last in a long line of Polish insurrections in 1863. The Italo-Polish era of heroic violence had end ed ; and the new and very different Russian tradi­ tion was about to begin. The Rival Social Revoluti onaries The rival tradition of social revolution, as we have said, was less suc­ cessful than that of national revolution throughout the I83o-48 period. Social revolutionary leaders were usua lly lonely emigre intellectuals divorced from the masses . Even among urban workers there was little organized class wa rfare, let alone proletarian consciousness, outside of Paris and Lyon . Yet a sense of impending social revolution haunted much of Europe in the I83os. The conservative de Tocqueville, in the preface to his"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"National vs. Social Revolution 17 3 Democracy in America of 1835, used the term \"social revolution,\" and spoke of it as \"irre sistible . . . an accomplished fact, or on the eve of its accomplishme nt.\" There were two ma in stages in the birth of a social revolutionary tradition, that is, in the transition from the republican conspiracies of the early twenties to the Marxist Communism of the late fortie s. First came the perfection of the idea of revolution ary dict atorship by Buona r­ roti in his last decade from 1828 to 1837. During this period, the revived Ba beuvist ideal of equa lity was linked with the proletarian class struggle by some of Buon arroti' s follow ers- and by his succes sor as chief or­ ganizer and symbol of revolution ary conspirac y-Auguste Blanqui. The second phase, lasting from the late 183os to 1848, was dominated by emigres, who both internationalized the impulse towards social revo­ lution and linked it with the working class. This progression of the so­ cial revolutionaries from conspiracy to ideology took place in Paris, London, Brussels, and Genev a. In these citi es, relatively free expres­ sion was pos sible , and the critical intellect was forced to confront the reality of a new industrial order. Buona rroti' s Legacy The starting point for a distinct and continuous social revolution ary tradition was the publicat ion in 1828-at the nadir of revolutionary hopes-of Buon arroti's ma ssive memorial to Babeuf : The Conspiracy for Equality. It provided at last both an ancest ry and a model for egalitarian revolution by publicizing the all-but-forgotten Babeuv ists.l74 The book was studied by both emigres and local Belgians, who were en­ couraged by Buo narroti to see in a social revolution ary organiz ation the \"Archimedean lever\" to overturn the world .175 The failure of all revolutions since 1789 had, in Buon arroti's view, been caused by a lack of strong leaders prepared in advance to give power to \"a revolutionary government of sages.\" 176 He harkened back to Babeuf's idea of delegating authority immediately to \"genera l commis­ sioners\" ( commissa ires generaux ) trained in revolutionary \"seminaries\" and insisted on the need for a \"provisional authority cha rged with com­ pleting the revolution and governing until popular institutions come into active being.\" 111 Buon arroti urged that th e revolutionary regime not submit itself to popular elections while initial revolutionar y changes were being ef­ fected; but fulfill three functions instead : (I) \"direct all the force of the nation against internal and external enemies,\" ( 2) \"create and esta blish the institutions through which the people will be imperceptibly led really to exercise sovereignty,\" and ( 3) \"prepare the popular Consti­ tution which should complete and close the revolution.\" 1 1 s The ultimate aim of the revolution was the Roussea uian one of re­ turning man to his \"natural\" state of liberty in which the \"general will\" prevails. Thus r ev o l u t i o n ar y power must be entrusted immediately to a \"strong, constant, enlightened immovable will,\" and \"the same will must direct the enfranchisement and prepare liberty .\" 1 79 \"Experience"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"1 74 THE DOMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIOKARIES has shown\" that the privileged are \"very poor directors of popular revo­ lutions\" and \"the people are incapable either of regenera tion by them­ selves or of designating the people who should direct the regenera­ tion .\" 1 8 o Buon arroti provided a mandate for the continued existence of an elite revolutionary dictatorship, and an implied license for the secret police surveillance of the future. In his retrospective version of the Ba beuf conspiracy, a final decision had been made by \"the secret directory\" that ... once the revolution is completed, it would not cease its works and would watch over the conduct of the new assembly. 1 8 1 Buona rroti was almost certainly influenced by the more authoritarian turn of mind among Italian emigres after the failure of the liberal revo­ lutions of the early 182os. The theorist of violence Carlo Bianco, who saw much of Buona rroti during this period, argued that the collapse of the const itutional reg imes in the early 182os was facilitated by the very liberties they granted. He insisted that revolutionaries should esta blish a strong provisional authority and that no one should \"deter­ mine in advance the durat ion .\" In language strongly sugge stive of Sorel's later paean to Mussolini, Bianco expr essed a preference for an individual dictator : \"a condottiero with a heart that is hard and inac­ cessible to any shriek for mercy .\" 1 s� Buon arroti's History was a model for modern revolutionary polemics in its Manichean simplification of a complex story into a clear, cosmic struggle of evil against good : \"egoism\" vs. \"equality .\" He immediately relegated to the camp of egoism almost all who ha d hitherto written about the revolution. He then pointed out that \"among the parties ... there is one on which the wise man should rivet his gaze \"; 1 H 3 and this party is presented as a kind of ultimate Masonic order, \"the sincere friends of equality.\" 1 8 4 Buon arroti had gone to Brussels in 1824 because the Belgian half of the newly created kingdom of the Net herlands was almost the only French-speaking area in Europe still tolerant of exiled political extrem­ ists. Many aging French revolutionaries had taken up permanent resi­ dence there ; it was largely among older revolutionary veterans that Buon arroti gathered the inner circle for his Monde organization. When Charles X abdicated after a struggle with the deputies that spilled into the streets, the constitutional monarch Louis Philippe suc­ ceeded him with the support of that patron and symbol of moderate revolution, the Marquis de Lafayette. However shocking it was to estab­ lished kings to see a monarch enthroned by a mob , the spectable was equ ally disquieting to extremists on the Left like Lafayette's former aide-de-camp and associate in the French Ca rbonari, Voyer D'Arg enson. Likewi se, the decision of Jean-Ba ptiste Teste, a former refugee in Bel­ gium, to become a minister of the new king repelled his brother, the publisher, Charles Teste. Thus D'Argenson and Teste formed together with Buon arroti in his last years a kind of revolutionary triumvirate 1 8 11 -the highest Illuminist \"triangle,\" perhaps, or the final inner circle of"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"National vs. Social Revolution 17 5 his Monde. In their eyes, the failure to institute a republic -let alone an egalitarian community-foredoomed the new French regime to failure long before its subservience to bourgeois capitalism ma de it a commonplace object of criticism and satire. When revolt broke out in Brussels late in August 1830, French repub­ licans were encouraged to believe that the revolutionary wave had not yet crest ed. Frenchmen moved into Belgium to defend the revolt; and Ch arles Rogier, who had many French revolution ary connecti ons, led troops in from Liege to become the president of a provisional govern­ ment. Buon arroti remained in Paris, but his friends participated in the agitation which led to the formation of a provisional revolutionary government on September 25. Buon arroti and Teste exercised direct, and at times con trollin g, influence on Rogier; on the more radical Louis De Potter, who briefly headed the provisional government; and on Felix Ba yet , who was Buona rroti's secret agent in Brussels. 186 Buona rroti urged the Belgians to provide the \"great example\" that France had failed to give revolutionary Europe : 1 87 to form \"fronts\" for the revolutionary leader ship by creating popular societies and jou rnals that would propa­ gate the virtues of a radical republican regime ,188 and to \"delay elec­ tions .. .

The new kin g, Leopold I, was a German who had married into the British royal family, just as -a t the opposite end of society from him-many work­ ers came from Germany to work in the expanding English-type indus­ tries of the bourgeois monarchy.

The Ba beuf-Marechal idea that an elite vanguard must rea lize the unfinished revolution was revived with a vengeance. De Potter's pamphlet of December 1831, On the revolution yet to be made, predicted that \"the first really social and popular revolution will fill up in reality and for all time the abyss of revolut ions.\" 193 Teste in­ sisted that \"the extraordinary authority of strong, wise and devoted men\" should exercise full interim power after any future revolution on behalf of \"the most advanced, magnetic, energetic and prudent party in the society.\" 19 4 Buon arroti himself now turned to Italy, where revolution still seemed possible.

The following year, this group allied with the Reformed Carbonari (radical republican veterans of the original French Ca rbon ari ) into the Universal Democratic Ca rbonari : the last effort to realize Buona rroti's dream of an international revolution ary or­ ganization. It had loose links with Belgian, Swiss, and German (and possibly Spanish and Portuguese ) movements as well as with France and Ital y.196 The goal was to realize equ ality \"not in name, but in fact.\" 197 The revolution ary conspiracy adopted names for lodges such as Jean­ Jacques and Saint-Just, the Ba beuvist term phalanx in place of the Car­ bon ari vente, and pseudonyms, codes , and security procedures that grew ever more complex with the mounting police repression. The plan for a reorganized Carbon ari organization involved two grades, the forest and the mountain-the former rec alling the original Ca rbonari, the latter the radical Mountain, now being glorified by a growing cult of Robes­ pierre among Buon arroti's associates. But by the mid-thirties both his foreign links and his \"universal\" organization had evaporated. Living in virtual exile in the Parisian home of Voyer D' Argenson until his death on September 16, 1837, Buona rroti ended up -literally-with the anagrams rather than the reality of a revolutionary organiz ation .1 9 H Buona rroti had survived long enough to become a living legend, and to attract the admiration of the very young, who were disillusioned with Louis Philippe in the way Buon arroti had been with the Directory. Many radica l leaders of socialism in the 184os-Ca bet, Blanc, and Buchez- apparently had contacts with the venerable \"Jean-Jacques\" in the mid 183os.1 99 Buon arroti also influenced the new generation of revolutionary artists -particularly the revolution ary painter, Phili ppe-Auguste Jeanron : the first to represent the proletariat in revolutiona ry scenes with a realistic style .� 0 0 Destined to illustrate Blanc's History of Ten Years and to di­ rect the Louvre during the revolution ary years 1848-so, in the 183os J eanron attacked not only the official art of the institute (\"the Ba stille of artists\" ), but also the neo-classical imitators of Da vid (\"the old regime in art\" ). Jeanron produced in the mid 1830s a haunting portrait of Buona rroti, 20 1 who in turn inspired Jeanron's procl amat ion of 1834 that \"After the beneficent storm, EQUALITY SHALL APPEAR UPON THE EARTH.\" 2 02 Buon arroti had also had a final brush of sorts with the ghost and legend of Napoleon. The most interesting new associate of Buon arroti's last years, Jean-Jacques Delor me, was the link with surviving Bonap art­ ists . As a young provincial from Lair-et-cher, Delorme had felt the grass­ roots appeal of the Na poleonic legend, and had been in sympathetic touch in the late 182os with circles that \"would prefer a Napoleon to a Bourbon if there were no other choice.\" 2 0 3 His vivid account of his links with Buona rroti at the same time provides a unique source for understanding the final revolutionary perspectives of the revolution ary patriarch.

Quest ioning the hostility to compromise of his revolutionary mentors, Delorme was told by Voyer D'Argenson (after a ceremonial banquet on M ontm artre late in 1833 ) that \"profound convictions are intolerant\" and that revolutionaries must maintain la severite de l'esprit exclus if.�()!; Anticipating the later Leninist concep tion of \"principled \" oppositi on , Buona rroti insisted on separating revolutionary from personal quarrels. The resulting sense of selfless dedication to an issue served in turn to intensify contempt for rivals in the political aren a. \"Pure love of equal­ ity,\" Buon arroti wrote in 1834, is \"the thread\" of Ariadne which will show \"the way out of the labyr inth .\" \"Sincere vows\" to equ ality must precede any political activity. Otherwise revolutionary activists will be­ come \"enemies of the people and of hum anity\" and \"all political changes will be deceptions and all revolutions incomplete and vici ous.\" 2 07 Even royalists and Bona partists now \"call themselves republicans to deceive the weak,\" wrote Buona rroti, 2o s as he adopted his final pseudonym of \"M aximilien\" to dramatize his admiration for Robespier re. Bu on arroti also warned against the temptation to drift off into scholarly discus­ sions. Revolution aries have \"no greater enemies than would-be scholars ( les pretendus savants ): such people, pet rified with vanity, are the aris­ tocracy inc arn ate.\" 2 ou Buona rroti's most important new body of followers in the I 83os had been the Polish revolutionary organization founded on the Island of Jersey on October 30, 1835 : the Polish People (Lud Polski ). This group called for the abolition of private prope rty , subdivided itself into com­ munes, published innumerable manifestoes and denunciations of mod­ erate refor mists. They thought of themselves as \"disciples of Buonar­ roti,\" and were \"the first ... publicly to accept his teaching as their own .\" 2 1 0 They took as their slogan Voyer d'Argenson's phrase l'egalite des conditions sociales, and urged an interim \"dicta torship of the peo­ ple\" to reeducate people after a revolution through terrorism, the use of the sword to bring principle into effect, intolerance of all that either now or at any time harms this principle or can endanger our aims. 2 1 1 The movement towards social revolutionary ideas in the 183os can be vividly illustrated through the brief career of Simon Konarski, who, independently of the Buona rrotia ns, carried the Polish revolutionary mentality farthest to the east and deepest into the masses .m A bri ll ia n t student from an impoverished aristocratic family of Polish Ca lvinis ts, Konarski had fought as a youth in the Polish Revolut ion of 1830- 31. In"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"17 8 T HE D OMINANCE OF THE N ATIONAL R EVOLUTIONARIES the best heroic tradition of his nation, Konarski did not stop when defeat was inevit able, but continued fighting in Lithuania and the east­ ern ma rches until mid 1831. After a brief intern ment, he emigrated to France and Belgium , where he became a protege of Lelewel and a mem­ ber of Young Poland. Thus he at first became the quintessential national revolutionary-rushing to Switzerland to participate in the ill-fated Mazzinian invasion of Savoy, keeping with him always both the pistol with which he fought and the flute on which he played patriotic songs. But the national cause alone could not fully satisfy his revolution ary longi ngs; and in the fall of 1834-a full year before the formation of the Polish People organiz ation -he moved on to his own form of social revolution. In his biweekly Parisian journal, Midnight, he called not only for an overthrow of Tsa rism, but for expropriating landowners , eman­ cipating peasants with land grant s, and e qualizing social classes. He also followed the new Buona rrotian pattern of planning for a provi­ sional revolutionary government in his \"The Transitional State and the Final Organization of Society.\" In 1835, he returned incognito to Poland and established a revolu­ tionary Society of the Polish People ( Stowarzyszenie Ludu Polskie go) in Cracow, then moved east to organize revolution ary cells in Lithu ania, White Russia, and the Ukraine. Across the vast area which stretched from the Baltic to the Black Sea, Kona rski spun a conspiratorial web which was estimated to have included about three thousand partici­ pants-and which soon became perhaps the first purely revolution ary orga nization to form a special, separate circle for women. Arrested at Vilnius late in May 1838, Konarski proved unbreakable under torture, converted his Russian guar ds, and would have probably esca ped had he not insisted that all other prisoners also be released. In a farewell verse to his fiancee from jail just before he was executed by a firing squad on February 25, 1839, Konarski wrote : \"I do not wish to go to heaven, while my people are in bondage.\" The revolutionary par excellence thus confronted without flinching a hopele ssness that extended from this world to the next. He had cre­ ated- among other thin gs-t he first student revolutionary movement ever to take root inside Russia. So great was the fear of his circle of student followers that Kiev University was shut altogether for a year. Imperial Russia in 1839-a s Custine's famous book of that year, Rus­ sia, eloquently pointed out 21 3-p roved the very heart of European re­ pression. It was of course to be in this same Russia that actua l social revoluti on, dimly foreshadowed in the Konarski movement, eventually took place. Blanqui If Buon arr oti had become the venerable old man of social revolution in France of the 183os, the cause was actua lly more deeply identified with the youthful Auguste Blanqui. Blanqui thought of a revolutionary movement as a force for educat ing the masses rather than purifying the members ; he was better equ ipped to ma ke revolution ary use of the"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"National vs. Social Revolution 179 new pos sibilities for political agitation under the new constitutional monarchy. Keeping alive the Buon arrotian tradition of secret hierarchi­ cal organiza tion , he still gave more concrete social content to the egali­ tarian ideal. Blanqui was descended from a north Italian family (Bianchi-Blanchi­ Blanqui ), and had joined the French version of the Carbonari during its period of decli ne.2 1 4 His interest in economic questions was aroused by his older brother, the economist Adolphe Blanqui, and also perh aps by the pioneering ideologue-economist Jean-Bapt iste Say, whose socialist utopia of 1799, Olbie, had envisaged the banishment of all tyrants, parasites, and pries ts. 2 1 5 Wounded three times in the electi on demonstrations of 1827, Blanqui set off on foot with a pack for the then almost ma ndatory \"rendez-vous of love\" with Greece. 21 G His romantic wande rings , however, took him only as far as conserva­ tive Italy and Spain, where he intensified his hatred of both monarchs and prie sts. He returned to Paris just in time for the July revolution , which permanently affected his imag inati on : No one could forget the marvelous suddenness with which the scene changed in the streets of Paris, as in a coup de theatre; how ordinary clothes replaced formal dre ss in the blinking of an eye as if a fairy's wand had made the one disappear and the other surge forth . ... 217 Mter the \"three glorious days,\" the only remaining revolutionary task was \"gat hering in the booty.\" The failure of national revolution ary lead­ ership to do this gave Blanqui his sense of permanent mission : to pro­ vide lead ership for a popular social revolution . He was determined to prevent the \"unworthy usurpa tion\" of revolutions by political opportun­ ists, the victory of les hommes du compto ir over les hommes des ateliers. 21 s Blanq ui felt from the beg inning a profound impatience with excessive verb alizin g. He became active in the radical republic an Friends of the People formed during the Revolu tion of 1830 \"to cons erve for the people the rights they have just conquer ed.\" He agitated for universal suffrage and full implementat ion of the radica l Jacobin const itution of 1793. 21 9 At his trial on Janua ry 15, 1832 (he was acquitted ), Blanqui began the modern revolutionary tradition of using the courtroom as a podium for a revolutionary profession de foi. To the ques tion \"W hat is your est ate ?\" ( etat) he answered simply \"prolet ariat.\" When the president of the court insisted \"that is not an estate,\" Blanqui repli ed : How can it not be? It is the estate of 30 million Frenchmen who live by their labor and are deprived of political rig hts.22 o Increasing agitat ion by the Friends of the People for social as well as civic equ ality began after Bla nqui's acquittal in the summer of 1832.

Blanqui insisted that mental intelligence and physical labor were interdependent needs for a successful revolution : Labor is the people; intelligence is the men of devotion who lead them. How could the brutal violence of priv ilege prevail against this invincible coalition. . . ? Here in essence was a call for a revolutionary intelligen tsia: \"intelli­ gence\" not just as a mental force but as a group of people pledged to social justice. 221 By 1834, most radical republicans had transferred their activities to the Society of the Rights of Man. This organization was a nationwide, open associ ation under a central committee, with sections of ten to twenty members elected by ma jority vote. This society gathered in local memberships from a wide variety of groups agitating for civil liberties and republicanism ; its variegated local affiliates assumed names as respecta ble as Washington and Stoicism and as disturbing as Revolu ­ tionary Power, Death to Tyran ts, and Buonarroti. 222 It was the first na­ tiona l society to extend its educ ational activities to the working class. It was largely against the growing strength of this amorphous organi­ zat ion that Louis Philippe early in 1834 dire cted new laws restricting the rights of asso ciation and the press. This action strengthened the hand of revolutionary republicans and helped precipitate new distur­ bances. Pola rization into extremes continued with a new wa ve of ar­ rests. The following year a former Corsican bandit together with two members of the Society of the Rights of Man made a bloody but un­ success ful attempt with their \"infernal mach ine\" to ass assinate Louis Philippe and his sons. The repressions that followed forced republ icans to move again from open to secret societi es; and the prisons of Louis Philippe became the centers of recruitment for a new wave of revolution ary organiz ation led by Blanqui. Blanqui led two successive cons piratorial organizatio ns, the Society of the Families and the Society of the Seasons, where in many ways th e modem social revolutionary tradition was born. The name \"family\" was probably taken from Buon arro ti's Italian secret society; 223 and its five­ member structure came from the French student circles of the early twenties where Blanqui served his revolution ary apprent iceship. Founded in the summer of 1834, the families gained twelve hundred adheren ts-ma ny of them workers from the militant \"revolutionary legions\" which had sworn to keep alive the insurrectionary traditions of 1834. 22 4 The secret hierarchical organiz ation often expanded to in­ clude as many as twelve members in a nuclear family cell. There were five or six families to a section; and two or three sections to a qua rter, whose leaders were linked with the secret, central committee through a revolutionary agent. Special authority to screen members was invested in a three-man jury; and the catechism for new members reiterated the Buon arrotian mess age that egoism was \"the dominant vice of society\" as it now existed and \"equ ality\" the \"principle basis of society\" as it should be. \"New aristocrats\" ruled by force and money; but the revolu-"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"National vs. Social Revolution tionaries had new allies in the \"proletariat,\" whose lot was now \"sim­ ilar to that of serfs and negr oes.\" The last of fifteen questions and answers for the would-be member of a family was : Is it necessa ry to make a political or social revolution? -It is necessary to make a social revolution . 2 25 The Society of the Families was crushed through police penetration in 1836. When Blanqui was released from prison in 1837, he reor­ ganized it as the Society of the Seasons with a more proletarian com­ position and an even more florid form of organiz ation evoking the idea of revolutionaries as mysterious agents of a higher natural order. The basic cell was a week composed of six men with a chief called Sunday. At the next level, four weeks comprised a twenty-nine-man month with a chief called July; three months constituted a season with a chief called Spring. Four seasons made a year with a chief who was the supreme agent of the revolution for the given are a. At the head of the Seasons, which at its peak included about nine hundred members, was a triumvirate of leaders : Blanqui, Armand Barbes, and Martin Ber­ nard. 226 This triumvirate sought to lead not just the revolution ary struggle, but an interim revolutionary government as well. 22 7 In an insu rrection be­ gun on Sunday, Ma y 12, 1839, the Seasons anticipated the Bolshevik idea of striking directly for the centers of power : transport and com­ munication. On a prepared plan they seized the Hotel de Ville and Palais de Justi ce ; but the absence of widespread popular support (the \"silence of the stre ets\" ) made the triumph short-live d. With its leaders condemned to imprisonment in Mont-S aint-Michel, the tradition of rev­ olutionary conspiracy largely ended in Paris. However, this secret tradition continued to flourish in outl ying re­ gions. In the same 1839, much of Ireland lay in terror before the Irish Sons of Freedom and Sons of the Shamrock or Ribbon Society. This secret revolution ary organization had attempted to impose profes­ sional discipline on an old and hallowed Irish tradition of agrarian violence by est ablishing regional brotherhoods in which a master had power over three members , who in tum each commanded twelve broth­ ers. 228 Secret passwor ds, recog nition signals, and ribbons were changed with each season; and carefully targeted beatings (\"slatings\" ) were un­ dertaken by leaders such as one Edward Kennedy, who later became the principal informer at their trial in Dublin.229 There was a central committee in Dublin 2 R 0 which apparently entertained some hopes of forming alliances with Scots and even Englishmen. 231 Ribbonism was feared not only as a kind of counter-government in Ireland but also as an instrument of class warfare within the British Kingdom. In sentencing the principal leader in 1840, the judg e spoke of \"the protection of the working classes against being duped into the commission of crimes which they never contemp lated.\" 232 Unlike Bla nqui's Society of the Seasons, the Ribbon Society did not attempt a political coup.

German Emigres One dec ade after Buona rroti's death in 1837 and eight years after Blanqui's eclipse, the social revolutionary tradition gave birth to the Communist League. A small group of young German emigres created this short-lived but hist oric organization. They took over the struggle within the German emigration \"between national republicans and com­ munist republic ans,\" 234 and produced a leader for the latter camp in Karl Ma rx. He fortified the entire European social revolution ary camp with an ideological armory and strategic perspective it had never pos­ sessed before. The scene for this German drama was the liberal metropolitan centers of the non-German world : Paris and London -a nd, to a lesser extent, Brussels and Geneva. There the possi bilities for free expression and as­ sembly were gre atest, and the plight of the growing industrial prole­ tariat most inescapable. These cosmopolitan, multi-lin gual centers of bourgeois capitalism provided favorable breeding grounds for the tough­ minded secula rism that eventu ally prevailed in Ma rx's Manif esto. The first stage, however, in est ablishing links between emigre intelle ctua ls and indigenous workers was the new surge of romantic religiosity which swept through the intellectuals themselves in the late 183os and 184os. Infatuation with religious ideas helped reassure social revolutionaries that a total transformation of society was still pos sible even at a time of repression and of disillusionment with the experiments of the early Fourier ists and Saint-Simoni ans. At the same time, religious images en­ abled revolutionaries to communicate anew with the still-pious masses . This was important in building a base for the top-heavy revolutionary organizatio ns. It was also important psychologic ally in providing hu­ man links for deracinated intellec tuals within the impersonal city. Sm all-group solid arity- face-to-face human relation s-w as a deep need for sensitive and isolated leaders. The small revolution ary band as a surrogate family with quas i-religious rituals had often answered this need, particul arly in Italy. Some of the new political exiles were , however, attached to ideas, divorced from local allegianc es, and seized by a revolution ary vision that was-to use a favorite word of the decade- unive rsal. In the early 184os, the tota lly uprooted Franco-Peruvian author of Peregrina­ tions of a Pariah, Flora Tristan, drew up in London the first plan for an all-Europ ean proletarian alli ance, the Union ouvriere. 2 35 In the early"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"National vs. Social Revolution r8sos, continental emigres in London calling themselves \"the outlaws\" (proscri ts) formed an alliance of revolutionary nationalists for a \"uni­ versal republic .\" These were the first in a series of attempts by political exiles at ecumenical organization that led eventu ally to the First Inter­ national.2 3 6 A certain thirst for conflagr ation began to infect the intel lectua ls . Flora Tris tan, for instance, called for a purely \"intellectual union\" of worke rs , but wanted it animated by \"fire in the hea rt\" so that it could constitute \"a firebrand in the system .\" To the sugg estion that one must ignite such firebrands, she repli ed : \"Not before one is sure that the fire would be inextin guishable.\" 2 37 The more universal the dream of brotherhood the greater the personal need often was for a protective \"family\" or-to cite another image of Flora Tri stan' s-a \"nest.\" It was principally among the Germans that the progression from na­ tional to \"universal\" social perspectives had taken place. Disillusioned with the reactionary turn of their new national leader, Frederick Wil­ liam IV of Prussia, Germans were in any case inclined to a broader perspective by their traditions of theological and philosophical specu­ lation-and also by the absence of a nation alistic emigre subcultu re such as the Poles and Italians enjoyed in Paris and London. To be sure, the revolution ary movement among German emigres , as elsewhere, was initially nationali st, with the formation in 1832 of a German People's Union in Paris and of a Young Germany affiliated with Mazzini's Young Europe the following year in Gene va. Many were vet­ erans of the ill-fated German revolutions of 1830; others had joined emigre Polish nationalists in the Ha mbacher Fest of 1832 before set­ tling together with the Poles in the safer surroundings of Paris or Ge­ neva. In Switzerland, where the maj ority of early German emigres tended to go for linguistic reasons, the religiosity of Lamennais and Mazzini tended to domin ate. Those who went to Paris were, however, mostly secula r intellectuals from the Rhineland attracted by the example of succes sful revolution in Fra nce, and quick to imitate the new orga nizations that were spring­ ing up \"like mushrooms after rain\" in Paris . After the repressive mea­ sures of 1834, German radicals in Paris followed their French counter­ parts in moving towards more extreme organizations, founding in July I 834 the League of the Outlaws ( Bund der Geiichteten ). Its leader, Theodore Schuster, was less explicitly revolution ary than his French counterpart, Blanqui, but apparently borrowed directly from Buon ar­ roti's final fantasy of a Universal Democratic Carbon ari .238 Schus ter's hierarchical structure had regional tents or foundaries ascending up through provincial camps to a central focus or burning point. 239 Schuster's Confession of Faith of an Outlaw, written in 1834, 2 40 was perhaps the first example of a portrayal of the coming revolution as a necessa ry cre ation of the outcasts of society. He suggested that re­ jected exiles and outl aws would provide the elemental power of the revolution. Bakunin picked up this idea in the early r84os,2 4 1 and later popularized it among Russian revolutionary popul ists. Schuster, however, anticipated more the Marxist conception of a pro-"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"1 8 4 T HE D OMINANCE OF THE N ATIONAL R EVOLUTIONARIES leta rian revolution than the romantic idea of a bandit uprisin g. In his journal, The Outlaws, which appeared until the society was abolished in 1836, Schuster spoke not only of Buon arro tian social equa lity, but also of inevitable class struggle. He advocated productive cooperatives as a means of protecting the poor and enhancing their solidarity. 242 Schuster and his associates took a skeptical view of the republican and civil libertarian ideals of the French. The fact that they tended to be working class in origin and at the same time of a relatively high edu­ cational level predisposed the Germans to a more concrete, economic approach to the problems of their time. Seeing such problems as com­ mon to both France and Germany, they argued that the deepest divi­ sions in Europe were now between social classes. 2 43 Schuster advo­ cated government intervention to prevent the rule of capitalists over workers through a \"cooperative republic .\" 24 4 The Outlaws were the first international organiz ation of social revolu­ tionar ies. With about one hundred members in Paris and at least seventy to eighty members in the area of Frankfurt am Main, 2 45 they soon outg rew their con spiratorial cocoon. Schuster led one group back into the national revolution ary camp via a new League of Germ ans ; 2 4 6 but the larger successor organiz ation was the League of the Just, which drew up its sta tutes in Paris as the Outlaws were disintegrating in late 1837 and early 1838. The new organiz ation was less hierarchical in structure and more directly responsive to worki ng-class interests tha n the Outlaws. Though its federative orga nization and social demands resembled those of Elan­ qui's Society of the Seasons, there was a new strain of internal democ­ racy. Officers were now elected loc ally rather than appointed from the center, and orders that violated personal conscience could be ignored. 2 4 7 Ten members formed a commune, ten communes a county. Delegates from each county made up a hall ( halle ), which was to elect both an executive committee in charge of political direction and a committee of assistance in charge of ma terial support and adjudic ation within the one thousand-man society. No longer content with the abstract political rights of the French republican tradition, the German League of the Just followed the So­ ciety of the Seasons in insisting on \"the right to existence\" and to edu­ cat ion as well as the right to vote. They fortified the Buon arrotian call for provisional revolution ary dict atorship with a medical meta phor : The state of society ha ving become gangrenous, the people will need-in order to pass into a healthy state-a revolutionary power for some time.24� Here was the hint of forthcoming amputations by self-appointed sur­ geons for the sick society. The organic image of society implicitly chal­ lenged the open, contractual concept of politics common to revolution­ ary republic ans. A split soon developed between advocates of political agitation and partisans of a social revolution to create a \"community of goods.\" The former group (called cabinet-makers or carpenters be­ cause of the guild affiliation of some leaders ) opposed the more revolu-"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"National vs. Social Revolut ion tionary faction (ca lled tailors or shoemake rs ). This split between po­ litical refor mists and social revolutionaries paralleled the schism in France between radical republicans who sought gains for workers through the political system, and social revolutionaries like Bla nqui who wished to overthrow it altogether. One key member of the more extreme tailor faction within both the Outlaws and the Just was Joha nn Hoeckerig, who was a protege and vis­ itor of Buon arroti in his last days. Hoeckerig had founded a short­ lived Franco-German radical journal in 1836 and subsequently intro­ duced a number of Germans into Ma sonic and revolutionary activity in Paris-moving even beyond Bu ona rroti, who had believed in a Grand Architect though not a Creator God, to pure athe ism . 2 49 But most of the revolutionary minority among the approximately eighty-eight thousand Germans in Paris in the 1830s retained a special qua lity of religiosity. German workers and craftsmen were closer to a communal religious life than the cosmopolitan, Francophile intellec­ tuals ; and the Germans proved receptive to Lamennais's suggest ion that the alternative to bourgeois exploitation would be some new kind of social Christianity. 2 5 0 Just as uprooted Catholic intellectuals from Italy and Poland drew hope for national revolution from Lamennais's Words of a Believer, so uprooted Protestant workers from Germany saw the out lines of a coming social revolution in Lamennais's picture of \"the people\" as the suffering servant of God with a mes sianic desti ny. Karl Schapper, leader of the Paris section of the League of the Just, had moved from an early allegiance to Mazzini to egalita rian social­ ism. 2 5 1 Addressing his followers as \"Brothers in Christ,\" he des cribed the coming social revolution as \"the great resurrection day of the peo­ ple\" that will sweep away not just the \"aristocracy of money,\" but also the \"aristocracy of the mind.\" Revolutionaries should beware, however, of intell ectuals, who ... think little of the people and believe that heads filled with book learning make them better than other people [and entitled] to make laws and govern .... 25 2 Scha pper's anti-intelle ctual religiosity was intensified and popularized by the tailor Wilhelm Weitlin g, who wrote the principal ma nifesto for the League : Huma nity as it is and a:s it ought to be. Under the influence of Lamennais's Book of the People, which he translated, 2 5a Weitling proclaimed himself to be a \"social Luther.\" His clandest inely printed Huma nity conveyed in tones of ear thy simplicity the thirst for relig­ ious community within the uprooted, newly indust rialized working class. His diagnosis was primitive, and his prescription utopian. But simplicity and directness reached the new mass audi ence. Its two thou­ sand copies were widely distributed and discussed, and Huma nity be­ came the model for subsequent manif estoes of social revolution . Inequality, Weitling argued, was increasing rather than vanishing in the face of industrialization. All exploitation and corruption could be traced to one disease carrier : money.

Against the artifi cial world of this false medium Weitling juxtaposed a utopian alternative to be based on a fusion of the \"law of nature\" with the \"law of ch arity\" -a melange of Buon arroti and Lamennais, of radical secula r enlightenment with visionary Christian sentiment. All individual property ownership and right of inheritance were to be abol­ ished. The value of all products was henceforth to be calculated in terms not of money, but of hours of work. Conflict was to be resolved and rights guaranteed not by republican political for ms, but by two totally new social authoriti es : the \"order of families\" and the \"order of producti on.\" The order of families most likely drew its name and federative struc­ ture from Bla nqui's Society of the Famili es. The pyramid ascended from local assemblies elected by universal suffrage up to a supreme Senate which was to appoint an executive director to dete rmine social priori ties for each million inhabit ants. The natural unstructured social unit, the family-rather than any artificial economic identity -was the basis for all higher social authority. The order of production divided society into four sep arate estates : the rural, the worker, the intell ectual, and the industrial. The first three were decentralized. But the industrial estate-dea ling with public util­ ities and heavy ma nufac turin g-r equired a cent ralized \"industrial army,\" in which everyone between the ages of fifteen and eighteen would be required to serve. The only permissible commercia l exchange was that earned by supplementary volunteer labor (during so-called \"commercial hours\" ) in special factories in which alone \"objects of luxury or fantasy\" could be produced. 25 4 Weitling initially had no idea of bringing such an order about by viole nce. Despite ma ny connections with the Society of the Seasons, the League of the Just did little to aid its insurrection of May 1839 in Paris. When, however, ma ny members were arre sted in the general re­ pression and the survivors forced to emigrate a second time , the Ger­ ma ns began to explore more revolution ary paths. The largest element of this new emigration moved to London, and helped form in Febru ary 1840 an Educ ational Society for German Work­ ingmen .2 55 Three transplanted leaders of the Paris League of the Just (Schapper, Bauer, and Moll ) took the lead in organizing this larger new society, while simultaneously keeping alive something of their sm aller old organization. 2 56 The Chartist Catalyst The quasi-Christian influence of Weitling was we aker in London than in Switzerland, where Weitling had initially emigrated.

Ch artism has been seen in retrospect as a reformist rather than rev­ olutionary movement : open agitation for rights rather than clandest ine organization for upheaval. The English Reform Bill of I832 focused attention on political rather than social change. The Victorian estab­ lish ment-so the accepted wisdom runs-p rovided just enough light at the top of the chimney to persuade the dispossessed to continue climbing up through the soot rather than to contemplate tearin g down the house. But Ch artism had a Europe an-wide impact on revolutionar ies. This large-scale movement was launched in the I83os in order to oppose the authority of a propertied parliament with the more revolutionary idea of full popular sovereignty : annual elections based on universal suffrage. The radical proposal of a \"people's charter\" in I838 led in the following summer to a direct challenge to Parliament by a \"national convention\" summoned to present a petition with one and one-qu arter million signatures to the House of Commons. As the subsequent petitions of I842 and I848 were also to be, this was rejected. Much of the Cha rtist program was to be incrementally adopted in later reform bills. But the radical wing of the Chartist move­ ment dramatized the continuing pos sibility of violent direct action by the working class ; and their increasingly desperate sea rch for allies brought them into collaboration with the German emigres who left France after the parallel failure of the Bla nquist insurrection in I83g. Radical Chartists were the first in the modern world both to suggest (in I 832 ) 257 and to attempt (in I 842 ) a nationwide general strike as a means to power for the working class. The London Working Men's As­ sociation, formed by radical Chartists in June I836, internationalized their quest for revolutionary act ion a few months later by issuing a \"Ma nifesto of Solidarity to the Working Classes of Belg ium\" in support of the arrested Buona rrotian Jacob Kats. 2 5 8 This pamphlet was distrib­ uted in Germany by the Leag ue of the Just and used as a means of raising money. German links with the Chartists became even closer in I837 when the latter's more radical membe rs, George Julian Ha rney and Bron terre O'Brien, broke away to form the more militant Demo­ cratic Association. These two played key roles in pioneering the inter­ national social revolutionary tradition. As early as I833 O'Brien argued that the working class must have \"complete dominion over the fruits of their own industr y.\" An entire change in society-a change amounting to a complete subversion of the existing \"order of the world\"-is contemplated by the working classes. They aspire to be at the top instead of at the bottom of society-or rather that there should be no bottom or top at all.2 59 A displaced Irishman impressed by his stay in Paris, O'Brien looked to cosmopolitan London and to foreign support for help in countering the dominant trend in Chartism towards moderate refor mism. 26 o Ha rney's role as secreta ry to the Democratic Association was even more impor-"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"1 88 T HE D OMINANCE OF THE N ATIONAL R EVOLUTIONARIES tant.

The Chartists arranged in his honor the first truly international meeting of social revolutionaries in London on Sep­ tember 22, 1844: the anniversary of the founding of the first French Repu blic. Ha iled as \"a ma rtyr in the cause of Communism,\" 262 Weit­ ling proposed a toast \"to that social organizat ion which leads through republic to the community .\" 2 6 3 A British speaker followed him with a speech that looked even more explicitly beyond politics to a communist society. He argued that the French revolutionaries had \"tried conven­ tion, dire ctory, consulate and empire, and had found mere political changes insufficient.\" Thus had Ba beuf and Buona rroti arisen to decl are that without reform and common labor and enjoyment, the end of the revolution was not gained. 26 4 He proposed a massive \"communist\" publicat ion program in French, German, and Italian so that \"the world would be revolutionali zed. \" 2 6 \" Those who hoped for international social revolution tended to disre­ gard not just the national ques tion but pol itic al issues altogether . The League of the Just proclaimed to the rebellious Silesian weavers in October 1844 that the coming emancip ation of the proletariat ma de the form of government almost irrele vant : It is all the same to us whether the state is monarchist, cons titution al or republican, so long as it is founded only upon justice. 2GG Excited by the international proletarian cause , the German Educa­ tional Society in London began adding foreign members. From a scant thirty members in 1844, they grew by June 1846 to two hundred fifty membe rs, including forty Scandin avia ns, thirty Ger mans, twenty Hun­ gar ians, and other repr esentat ives from Latin and Sla vic lands as well as from the Low Countrie s. 2 6 7 The Germans regul arized cooperation with French and Polish political exiles through an inform al, international society of 1844, the Democratic Friends of All Nations. Its name and organizational ideas were taken from Ha rney's Democratic Association. On September 22, 1845, German rel ations with the Chartists were for­ ma lized at another meeting to commemorate the founding of the first French Republic. This truly international Festival of Na tions led to the founding of the International Democ ratic Associ ation under Harney, who insisted at the banquet that the word \"foreigner\" be expunged from the"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"National vs. Social Revolution 1 8 9 dictionary. In Ma rch 1846, Harney founded yet another, even broader, internat ional group, the Fraternal Democrats, with Poland, Germany, Fra nce, England, Hungary, Switzerland , and Scandinavia all repre­ sented in the secretariat. Harney issued a ma nifesto to the workers of America and Brit ain dur­ ing the war crisis of 1846 between the two cou ntrie s, urging that the proletariat not be diverted from social issues into national wars. The League of the Just adopted in the course of 1846 the Fraternal Demo­ crats' slogan \"All men are brothers,\" and made London formally the headqua rters of the League. 26 s A similar call for transnational unity in the \"abolition of property\" had been issued in Switzerland late in I 844 in the pamphlet What do the Communists Want? by the leading survivor of Weitling's original communist organizat ion : If we speak of the liberation of humanity, we mean that the liberty which we hope for is not German or French or North American freedom, but the real freedom of man. 26 9 The message of social revolution was also being spread to the New World. In November 1845 secret members of the League of the Just helped an industrial congress in New York focus on the disp arity be­ tween the ega litarian language of the Decla ration of Independence and the inequa lities of the industrial order. Calling themselves \"the German Commune of Young Amer ica,\" they led the German community in New York to form a special Social Reform Association within the Na tional Reform Associ ation in Amer ica. 2 7 0 Their German-lan guage journal, which first appeared in New York in January 1846 under the Babeuvist title, Tribune of the People, addressed itself to \"the poor, the sup­ plic ants, the oppressed. \" 2 7 1 Both the journa l and the associ ation attracted attent ion among German immigrants in ma jor American cit­ ies from Boston to Milwaukee to St. Louis. On July 4, 1846, the German movement in England prevailed on Har­ ney's \"Fraternal Democrats\" to appeal to the \"Workers of America\" on the seventieth anniversary of the Decla ration of Independence ... to crown the perfection of your institutions with the abolition of the slavery of whites as well as blacks-of the salary as well as the whip ; to expel from your legislative assemblies landed proprietors, userers, lawyers, mercenaries and other charlatans and idlers. 272 Lasting leadership for the social revolutionaries was to come, however, neither from emigre German workers nor from English democr ats. The figures who fused proletarian communism with democratic internation­ alism were two German intellectuals in Brussels : Karl Marx, the learned son of a distinguished jurist from Trier, and Frederick Engels, the widely read and traveled offspring of a wea lthy indust rialist from Wup­ pertal.

Moder ation provided food for caricature ; and, in his last years, the ag­ ing Lafayette could not escape. He , who had typified the moderate , con­ stitutional ideal among revolutionar ies -a dashing freedom fighter in Amer ica, the first ambass ador to the United States, and perhaps the most lionized foreign visitor to early America on his triumphal return in 1824-25-was to prove as much a political failure in France as he had been a success in Americ a. His tolerant deism, his belief in natural rights and const itutional propr iety, which had earned him so much ad­ miration in Americ a, were to win more enemies than friends in Fra nce. He was repeatedly caught between the scissor blades of Right and Left as they cut through him to steely confrontation with each other. Both const itutional monarchies that he backed, that of 1791 and 1830, were undercut from both Right and Left almost as soon as they were promulgated. Lafayette had attached himself to Washington upon his arrival in America as a boy of nineteen in 1777. But in France he neither found such a leader nor became one himself. His hopes for Louis XVI proved misplaced; and by the end of 1830 his faith in Louis Philippe had faded. Disda in for Na poleon born of a sense of rivalry cut Lafayette off from influence on that era. He had joined Na poleon only for the final, ill-fated Hundred Days, and for an unsuccessful effort (as vice-president of Na poleon's chamber of deputies ) to establish Na poleon's son as ruler of France under a regency. If one accepts the brilliant charac terization of his grand nephew and post humous editor, Charles Remusat, Lafayette cannot simply be dis­ missed as a \"statue looking for its pedestaf' 1 in Lafitte's term, or, in Mira beau's, as a statesman who \"avait bien saute pour reculer.\" 2 Nor was Lafayette simply an ineffectual moderate, like so ma ny Girondists and Orlea nists, addicted to timid compromise or self-interested oppor­ tunism. Despite superficial similarities and occasional allia nces , Lafay­ ette disliked and fought most such moderat es. \"Il n ' y a pas de milieu,\" Remusat insisted desp airingly to Lafayette during the initial revolutionary chaos of 1830.3 But Lafayette rejected the extreme alternatives of either a republic under himself or a mon­ archy under the Bourbo ns. He proposed instead a constitut ional mon­ archy under the new house of Orle ans. The opposite of liberal was \"doctrinaire,\" 4 and its political style was moderate, but not un­ principled. \"Moderation,\" he wrote in the last year of his life, \"has never been for me the middle point between any two opinions whatsoever .\" 5 It was rather a positive commitment \"to the cause of liberty\" guaranteed by a rule of law and representative institut ions; and an equa lly firm op­ position to \"the adversa ries of the cause under whatever form : despotic , aristocratic, anarchi c.\" In his political testament, Lafayette equated mod­ eration with the militant defense of : The sacred cause of liberty from the heresies that denature it, the excesses that retard it, the crimes that profane it, and the apologies that"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"The Evolutionary Alternative 1 93 would still defeat it-if it had not found refuge in the pure memories and sublime sentiments which charact erize the great work of the people . 6 This \"great work of the people\" was to have been the est ablishment of political freedom and civil liberty through the original French Revolu­ tion of 1789- 91. Despite secure social roots in the aris tocracy and ample personal wealth, Lafayette believed that there were revolutions yet to be made. But they were to be limited, const itutional revolutions designed to initiate popula r sovereignty and release individual initiative . When reaction closed in on France with a vengeance in I 824, Lafayette refurbished his image as elder of the revolution with a long and wildly successful trip to the United States. He returned in 1825 to be greeted by insecure student agitators seeking him out for long discussions. It is hard to _ determine exactly how intimate and extensive his col­ laboration actu ally was with the many revolution ary groups with which he had contact throughout the 182os. Police investigations were reluc­ tant to probe too deeply when the trail pointed towards such a power­ ful and respected figure.7 His hold on the imagination of the young represented in many ways a transfer of messi anic expectations follow­ ing the death of Na poleon in 1821. He presented himself as both the successor to and the antithesis of \"the false liberation of Na poleon.\" By cont rast, he seemed to be blending posi tive sentiments into a pro­ gram of liberal rationality. His aristocratic remoteness from dire ct par­ ticipation in conspiracy made him even more invulnerable as a hero when the conspiracies faile d. In any case, more important than the deta ils of how Lafayette col­ laborated with the new generation of European revolutionaries is the question of why. The answer tells us much about the enduring power of the revolution ary ideal. In 1787, prior to the revolution in Fra nce, he had argued before the assembly of notables for both toleration of Prot­ estants and a national assembly. He had thus favored legitimizing both the ideological and political opposition, a step that might have helped France to follow the English and Swiss path for preventing the development of a revolutiona ry tradition. And he argued with no less pass ion for full popular sovereignty in his last ma jor speech before the Chamber of Deputies just before his death in 1834. Like his friend Thomas Jefferson, Lafayette continued to believe in re­ newal through perpetual reexamination and periodic revolution. But whereas Jeffersonians envisaged such revolutions as taking place within the system, the young French radicals who looked to Lafayette during the restoration were not so sure. Lafayette always viewed himself as working through the system even when cooperating with cla ndestine revolution ary groups. Like ma ny an aging reformer in later times , he thought he could elevate and educate the young extrem ists -a nd per­ haps also recover something of his own youth amidst an army of adonis-liberators. Because of his own sincerity and disinter estedn ess, Lafayette was seduced by these qualities in othe rs. How could he resist a new generation \"so irre proachable and interesting which crowded around him and whose disinteres tedn ess, devo tion and ardor demanded"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"1 94 T HE D OMINANCE OF THE N ATIONAL R EVOLUTIONARIES that he put himself out for them ?\" 8 He was unable to see that the young conspirators of the restoration sought not so much liberty in his eighteenth-century understanding as the new romantic goals of equ ality and fraternity. To him, they were the new version of his old regiment. His feeling of duty to the young may also have been compounded by feelings of guilt toward his own son. Like many indulgent liberal fathers of revolutionary children in our own time, Lafayette had neglected his son George and his educ ation because of preoccup ation with high pol­ itics and public affairs. The boy in turn had become an introverted and narrow revolutionary, idolizing the views of his father but rejecting his incongruously aristocratic style of life and discou rse. Within the house of Lafayette there grew up \"a disintere sted, modest, and exacting fa­ natic such as one must find in new religions [with] a holy abhorance for men of wit and a marked preference for common men.\" 9 The constant accus ation of hypocrisy that such a young man presented to Lafayette may well have had its effect. In any event, Lafa yette's decision to become a father figure to younger revolutionaries may have been in part a belated effort to be a father to his son. He did succeed in winning back his son to a more moderate subsequent political career. But the views of the old lover of liberty never converged with those of the new believers in equality. La fayette esca ped from the young demonstrator at General La­ ma rque's funeral in 1832 who had said : \"If we were to kill General Lafayette, could not such a good death provide a call to arms ?\" 10 But, in the following year, he was killed off as a revolutionary symbol with the publication of Political Life of Lafayette, written by Buon arroti and his young confrere s, which excoriated the Ma rquis as an anachron ism , artificially preserved \"like a mummy in its bindin gs.\" n He was an ex­ ample of what to avoid -a false friend being more dangerous than a declared enemy ,1 2 As he had in so many other respects, Bonneville had, already in the early 1790s, anticipated these new attacks on Lafayette by cha ract er­ izing him as a \"tempor isateur; a double personality,\" who, being \"noth­ ing in either one party or the other, will be doubly nothin g.\" 1 3 But to unmask a figure of La fayette's venerability and stature after 1830 was no easy task. An extraordinary target required innovative ammunition , and the Buona rrotian salvo was in many ways a model for future ritual denunciations by revolution ari es. The tract is not a debate about gen­ eral ideas, but an illustrative unmasking of a particula r individ ual­ all, however, in the name of principle. The \"objec tive\" political signi­ ficance of Lafayette's failings are analyzed with an air of clinical detach­ ment. His \"subject ive\" statements and seeming accomplishments are simply neglected. Lafa yette was said to espouse \"egoism\" rather than \"equ ality\" because of his infatuation with the American rather than the French Revolu­ tion. Amer ica did not have a real revolution because of \"the egoistic character of its leaders\" who did not include \"a single proletarian\" 14 and inherited from England a baleful legacy of lega lism and localism."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"The Evolutionary Alternative 19 5 Federalism defeated unity and created a chaos of ever more inextricable laws. It is the feudal regime reclothed with democratic for ms.15 The same egoism which caused Americans to turn their backs on revolutionary France in 1793 led Lafayette to the \"omission of the word equa lity\" 1 6 from all his public speeches. Cle arly the \"hero of two worlds\" was no hero to the new social revolutionarie s. 1 7 Perhaps no role is more difficult to play in modern times than that of the moderate revolution ary : the man who honestly shares both the radical hope for a new sta rt and the conservative concern for older values and continuity. Not unlike a Mart in Luther King in a later era, Lafayette stood at the center of events and became the focal point \"of all the hat reds and all the prejudices\" 1 8 of a bitter time. If Lafayette never quite drew the lightning of ass assination, he faced a thousand jibes from Right and Left and a long period of posthumous obloquy. Just before his death, he spoke wea rily in a letter to an old Italian revolutionary of the osc illation between apathy and despotism, which feed on one another to hold back political ma turity and social progr ess . He saw a time coming when ... the great struggle will begin of the two princip les, the awakening of the oppressed against the oppressors; and there will be a European con­ flagration that could have been avoided by a modest adherence to the program of the Hotel de Ville .... 19 However distas teful this position may have become for old aristo­ crats, new revolutionarie s, and Orlt�anist opportunists alike, Lafayette remained the outsta nding symbol in Europe of moderate hopes for the general revolutionary ideal. Though he lamented the misfortune that resulted from the unsuccessful spread of the revolution to other coun­ tries in 1830, 20 he accepted membersh ip in the Po lish national guard in I 83 I and worked unce asingly on behalf of the fading Polish cause.2 1 He concluded that, if royal absolutism was the old foe, popular apathy was in many ways the new one. The corrosive force of indifference had driven sensitive figures like Lamennais into the arms first of reac­ tion and then of revolution. The desp air which Lafayette felt over political apathy in France was shared even by his more successful Swiss protege, James Fazy, during his period of deepest discouragem ent : C'est trop d'avoir a !utter a la fois contre !'indifference de ses amis et la malveillance de ses advers aire s. 2 2 But Lafayette never gave up hope. He continued to believe that liberal and national institutions would inevitably be est ablished in \"the two peninsulas\" (Italy and Spain ) as well as in Germany and Poland. 2 3 His ideal was always liberty, rather than equality and fraternity. He linked the old virtues of enlightened rationality with the new tech­ niques of constitut ional guarantee and parliamentary debate.

As the Masonic enconium at his funeral put it: the death of Na poleon was the extinction of a volcano ; the death of Lafayette was the setting of the sun.24 But it was the volcano, not the sun, that had dominated the political life of France during the revolutionary era. Lafayette's great moments -the Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789 and the \"three glorious days\" of 183o-were overshadowed by the more fateful convulsions of 1792 and 1848 respectively. Each of these eminently political revolutions eventually brought to power a Napoleon. In a world of polarized politics, centralized power, and demagogic leadership, there was little room for a Lafayette. Fazy and the Swiss Success The one successful revolution in Europe between 1830 and 1848 oc­ curred in Switzerl and. In the space of a few years, the Swiss moved from semi-feudal division under Hapsburg dominance into a federal republic with a bicameral legislature closely approxim ating the United States. The most important revolutionary leader was James Fazy, whose career provides a rare example of an American-type revolution prevail­ ing in continental Europe. He helped guide Switzerl and-despite its geographic and linguistic links with three cultures that pioneered con­ tinental revolutionary agitation-France, Italy, and Germany-into the essentia lly Anglo-American mold of \"bourgeois\" liberalism. James Fazy was born into a Huguenot family who had emigrated to Geneva and involved themselves with moderate success in commercial and manufacturing activities. One ancestor was a clock-maker to Cath­ erine the Great and another a cousin of Rousseau. The ideas of the latter exerted a strong influence on Fazy through his mother, and his father was a leading Genevan supporter of the original French Revolution .25 Born in I 794, Fazy was subjected to pietistic influences at the school of the Moravian Brethren in Neuwied, then thrust into the heady life of a Parisian university student in the early years of the restora­ tion. He founded a short-lived radical journal, La France chretienne in 1817, and helped organize the French Carbonari together with his brother Jean-Louis and Antoine Cerclet, who (like Fazy's mother ) had been born in Russia, and who later became a Saint-Simonian and editor of Le Nation al. 2 n Fazy's own interest in political journalism led him to write a criticism of the Bank of France, followed by a revolutionary fable and play.27 His first book-length work, a series of \"philosophical"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"The Evolutio nary Alternative 197 and political conversations of 1821,\" proclaimed \"Jesus Christ the first prophet of liberty and equality,\" and hailed the French Revolution as guaranteeing the spread of \"liberalism\" even to Asia and Mrica.2 8 Early in 1826 , he returned to Geneva and founded the journal de Geneve in an effort to oppose the political indifference of the restora­ tion era in his native city; but in August, he returned to Paris, where he worked on the Mercure de France au XIX siecle and signed protest ordinances against the repressive laws of Charles X on behalf of the journal La Revolution. 2 9 Fazy's imagin ation was fired by long conversations about the Ameri­ can experience with Lafayette ; and he later recalled a particularly ex­ citing description of America that the Marquis provided him during a long ride from La Grange to Paris . . . . if a stenographer had been there to record all that the general said, the book which De Tocqueville later published would ha ve been unnecessa ry .3 0 In Paris in 1828, he produced a neglected masterpiece, Gerontocracy, the first work systematica lly to identify the revolution ary struggle as one of youth vs. age. He was on the barricades in July 1830, and in the forefront of the radical republican opposition to Louis Philippe immediately thereafter. After harassment by the censorship and pay­ ment of a 6,ooo-franc fine, he returned to Geneva, announcing in 1831 his belief that only something like the \"federal system of the USA\" would \"fulfill the constitutional needs of Switzerl and.\" 3 1 Having shel­ tered Buonarroti in the early 182os,3 2 his household became the gather­ ing place of Mazzini and other nationalist revolutionaries in the early 183os. a 3 In 1833, he established the first daily paper ever published in Geneva, L'Europe Centrale, as a kind of journalistic counterpart to Mazzini's Young Europe. From radical journalism , he turned to radical politics in the late 1830s, producing in 1837 the first draft of an Americ an-type, federal constitution similar to that finally adopted by Switzerland a decade later. From 1835 to 1841, he devoted much of his energy to a lengthy History of Geneva, which exalted the role of ordinary citizens in both developing the city and resisting authoritarianism (Calvinist as well as Catholic). He broke sharply with Buonarroti's Swiss followers when they tried to transform Young Europe into an organ of social rather than political revolution .34 Despite close friendship with the pioneers of communism in Nyon, Lausanne and Geneva, Fazy opposed from the beginning the r estrictions on political freedom and econom ic growth that he found i nherent in their programs. Socialists as well as com­ munists were producing mummies rather than citizens, he believed, by shriveling and binding the dynamic political and economic processes that freedom releases. A report to Metternich in 1847 noted that Fazy's program for Geneva called for both freedoms (of religion and associa­ tion) and responsibilities (observing laws, promoting educati on) : Within these freedoms and limits, James Fazy believes that the life of the Republic will develop entirely on its own into a harmonious liberty"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"1 9 8 THE DoMINANCE oF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES with bodily and spiritual prosperity. He will hear nothing of socialism or communism .35 Fazy linked his republican ideal to \"bourgeois\" commerce, insisting that the increased circulation of money in a free society would itself solve many social problems and end traditional forms of bondage. Armed in 1841 with yet another new magazine, La Revue de Geneve, Fazy published a plan for the municipal organization of Geneva and with his brother gathered 950 signatures for a popular petition de­ manding an elective council. Skillfully allying his own radical minority with liberal deputies on the one side and revolutionary emigres on the other, he succeeded in getting the council of state to convene a con­ stituent assembly elected by all citizens in November 1841, 36 and suc­ cessfully resisted in the course of the I 84os the resurgent power of the Catholic Sonderbund within Switzer land. He became on October 6, 1846, head of a ten-man provisional revolution ary government which proved to be one of the most orderly and moderate in modem history. His government reformed the city in concrete ways-breaking the old economic monopolie s, democratizing the churche s, converting forts into housing and old people's homes, and so forth. Fazy also carried out a second constitutional reform of the city in 1847, which in tum in­ fluenced the structure of the federal republic that was established in all of Switzerland the following year. Fazy was a deputy to the constitutional Diet and a contributor to the federal constitution adopted by Switzerland in 1848. He helped persuade the king of Prussia to renounce his rights to Neuchatel, and remained head of the government of Geneva until 1864. He was a leader in both the local and national political activity of the Radical Party, in a host of journalistic and economic activitie s, and in education. He cham­ pioned the academic study of political economy in Switzerl and, and founded the Institut national genevois in 1852. He spent his last years lecturing, writing, and sponsoring apolitical civic projects in Geneva. Fazy had his failures and his enemies. His overall city plan for Ge­ neva was never successf ully carried out; and his own precarious finan­ cial situation led him into economic speculations that compromised his integrity .37 His political activity won him enemies in Geneva­ and many more among conservative, German-speaking Swiss.38 Never­ theless, his overall record is one of the most impressive of revolution­ ary politicians in the nineteenth century. Even conservatives did not interfere with the constitutional reforms that he had so solidly estab­ lished; and the critical chronicler of his record is probably not exag­ gerating in saying that \"Fazy brought forth a democracy and a new city.\" 3 9 Like so many revolutionaries in England and Americ a, Fazy was ab­ sorbed into the political system. In the process, he helped to change it -but was also changed by it. In ninetee nth-century Switzerland, as in seventeenth-century England and eighteenth-century Americ a, revolu­ tions enjoyed qualified success; and divisive recrimination soon ended."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"The Evolutionary Alternative 1 99 In part, one may credit underlying economic changes in all three coun­ tries with having kept political changes from being as soci ally revolu­ tionary as they had initially promised to become. Yet it is not enough simply to speak of rising bourgeois capitalism domesticating polit ical sloga ns; of yesterday's revolutionary activist becoming tomorrow's con­ servative raconteur. For the young man who in 1828 wrote the original indictment of rule by old men had emphatically not by the time of his death a half-century later become simply the \"debris left over from a time rich in storms\" 4 0 -a s he had accused the original French rev­ olutionaries of becoming during the restoration. There is an inner con­ sistency in his life's work-in both the ideas he expressed and the tradition he represen ted. Ideologically, he articulated as well as anyone what could be described as the progressive , evolutionary alternative to both revolution and reaction. More generally, the Swiss tradition pro­ vided a receptivity to incremental change that seems to have repre­ sented an effective -a nd perhaps instruc tive -i mmunity to the forma­ tion of a revolutionary tradition. In examining Fazy's ideas, one finds from the beg inning the belief in a humanized, person alized democracy- compounded of both the univer­ sal ideals of the French Revolution and the intim ate, communal ex­ perience of his native Switzerland. His roots in a Swiss manufactu ring family enabled him to come to grips in a way few radical social theo­ rists in continental Europe were able to do with both the irreversible necessity and the liberating potential of industrial development. Like Sa int-Simon, he believed in \"the necessity of an industrial revolution as the means of avoiding a new political revoluti on.\" 41 But unlike the Saint-Simonians, Fazy did not believe that the industrial age required a new authoritarian ideology and elite . To Fazy, the real conflict was be­ tween those societies that were closed and \"absolutist\" on the one hand and those that were open and \"examining\" on the other. He feared equa lly the old ecclesiastical authoritarians and the new political ideolo­ gists with their doctrines alarmantes du sans-culottisme apostolique. Restorat ion France was falsely preoccupied with protecting old wealth rather than creating new rich es. Taken up with the short-term political ma neuvering of \"all these more or less detestable or ridiculous par­ ties,\" 4 2 France had allowed itself to become the arena for the debilitat­ ing quarrels of old men. The \"debris of the emigr ation\" 43 was squab­ bling with the burnt-out revolutionary \"generation of '8g,\" which \"began by interdicting its fathe rs, and ended up disinheriting its childr en.\" 44 Youth must be given power because it was \"the virile part of the nation\" 45 that did most of the work and uniquely understood \"the real needs of the body social.\" 4 6 Youth sought concrete socio-economic goals rather than abstract political ide als ; and it must be allowed to advance civilization cautiously and experi menta lly-freed from the ritualized slogans and controversies of the revolutionary era. This faith in youth was neither a passing fancy nor an abstract idea for Fazy.

Alexander Herzen describes one such banquet during the revolu­ tionary year I 849 : Fazy delivered a thoroughly radical speech, congratulated the prize­ winners and proposed a toast \"To the future citize ns !\" to loud music and firing of cannon. After this the children went after him, two by two, to the field .... 47 With mounting bewilderm ent, Herzen recalls the spectacle of the par­ ents and other adults forming an avenue and saluting with their wea pons Fazy's parade of children : ... they presented arms ... Ye s! presented arms before their sons and the orphans .... The children were the honoured guests of the town, its \"future citiz ens.\" All this was strange to such of us as had been present at Russian school anniversaries and similar ceremonie s. 4 8 Fazy's bete noire was Spain, whose \"absolutist\" form of government produced \"general apathy\" in the populace and a static economy. He sought to build on the good ma nners and family feeling of sm all­ scale Swiss and German communal life, but to add the benefits of indus­ trial growth. His ideal societies were the open and enterprising coun­ tries of England and Americ a. This affection of his suggests a certain deep affinity between the nation he inhabited and those he admired . Fazy, like most political radicals in England and Americ a, remained ac­ tive to the end and was not forced into emigration. These three nations -u nlike those torn between revolution and react ion- provided a con­ tinuing opportunity for the innovative radical to make an enduring con­ tribution to his nation's development. Thu s, the difference between Fazy and most of his fellow Carbonari, who subsequently either burned out or sold out, lies less in person alities than in political systems. Fazy perfected the technique of effecting change through peaceful con­ stitutional and electoral agitation. By conceding regul arly to his conserv ative opponents on ma tters of nomenclature and terminology, he was generally able to prevail on essential matters of democrat ic rights and guarantees. As he noted after his successful struggle for the adop­ tion of a consti tution for Gene va: ... the greatest adversaries of the revolution themselves contributed to the most radical reform -s atisfied to triumph over us on some points of detail to which we seemed to cling, and which in fact were of little concern to us.49 Fazy used extra-legal means, but in a limited way in order to broaden political participation rather than narrowing it through manipulat ion or conspiracies. Thus, in November 1841, when the Council of State was blocking the constitutional reform that was called for by Fazy's popular petition, he proposed to go directly to St. Peter's Cathedral and summon the populace to authorize directly a democratic ally elected body to revise the constitution. Faced with a much more substa ntial conserv ative counter-attack in 1846 aga inst the constitution that was"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"The Evolutionary Alternative 201 adopted in 1842, Fazy did not hesitate to throw up barricades and pro­ claim a revolutionary government. Herzen described the annexation of power as \"an eighteenth Brumaire-f or the benefit of democracy and the peop le.\" Fazy appeared before the council to announce persona lly its dissolution. The members nearly arrested him , then asked in whose name he spoke . \"In the name of the people of Geneva, who are sick of your bad govern­ ment and are with me,\" and thereupon Fazy pulled back the curtain on the council-room door. A crowd of armed men filled the hall, ready at Fazy's first word to lower their weapons and fire . The old \"patricians\" and peace ful Calvinists were taken aback. \"Go away while there is time !\" said Fazy, and they meekly trudged home; and Fazy sat down at a table and wrote a decree ... , 5 o This is a no doubt exaggerated, but ess entially accurate, account of a rare nineteenth-cent ury victory for \"the audacity which Saint-Just con­ sidered esse ntial in a revolu tion ary.\" 51 Even here, the revolutionary act of seizing power was immediately subordinated to a constitutional pro­ gram; and the ten-man provisional government immediately sought to democrat ize the city within even as they prepared to defend it from external threats. Most significant of all was the importance that Fazy attached to in­ dividual rights as an aim of the revolution, always to be protected even against revolutionary leaders themselves. His preference for a bicam­ eral legislat ure , for the maintenance of local as well as central powe rs, and for checks and balances between the three branches of government -all were rooted in his admiration for the American system. But they also grew out of the suspicions that independent Swiss burghers felt for a long line of authoritarian intruders from the Holy Roman em­ perors to Na poleon. He sought to reta in the political integrity of the cantons to maximize local participation in government and to guard against the \"unitary tendencies\" 5 2 on which tyranny builds. His de­ fense of indiv idual rights of press, association, and religion was \"more Anglo-S axon than French in inspiration,\" the work of a man who had \"nothing Jacobin, statist and authoritarian\" in his ma ke-up .53 He de­ fended the diffusion of power by giving a libertarian twist to the doc­ trine of absolute popular sovereignty traditionall y used by Jacobin centralizers. The sovereignty of the people is an absolute sovereignty, the whole of which can never be entrusted to anyone ... The people never delegate more than parts of their sovereig nty.5 4 Fazy denounced communism not with conservative outrage, but with liberal disdain. It was an impractic al, foreign derangement that could never be \"representative of the people,\" Fazy contended early in 1842. \"Foreign governments alone seem to be aware of the presence of com­ munists in our cantons and of their works, which no one among our­ selves has seen.\" 55 Practical Swiss enterprise rejects the alien concept of"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"202 THE DoMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REvoLUTIONARIES ... the centralization of ownership ... by which German workers admitted into our cantons are preparing a ha ppy future in which they will no longer need to rob, since people posse ssing anything will already have been forced to give it up.56 Swiss family loyalties were likewise contrasted with the communist principle of \"the centralization of the family\" into \"a single great fam­ ily of humanity.\" 57 The Swiss disdain for communism was born both of confidence in their own constitutional revolution and of fear that concrete gains might be sacrificed for abstract goals. Already in March 1842, a Genevan jour­ nal noted proudly that Swiss workers in Laus anne had withdrawn from the meetings of German communists ... when they discovered that mutual instruction was only a pretext used to conceal some other objective. Communism runs aground on the good sense of the Swiss peop le.5S Fazy also became apprehensive about the authoritarian and centraliz­ ing dangers of revolutionary nation alism. Ha ving welcomed Garibaldi to Geneva in 1867 as the personification of \"the new generation,\" Fazy soon turned against him .59 Increasingly thereafter, he criticized the overconcentration of power in the modern state. He called for the fed­ eration of France, Spain, and Italy as a means of extending the Swiss formula to Europe and beginning a continental federation. 6 0 He also struck a Millsean note of al arm about the gathering threats to liberty from the new tyranny of ma jorities within democrac ies . He wrote a \"Declarat ion of Individual Rights,\" and his last work, On the Collective Intelligence of Societies, of 1873 insisted that individual rights must be guaranteed against collective authorities of all kin ds.61 Individual freedom with continuous openness to l'esprit examinateur provided the only chance for progress and the best hope of happiness for Fazy as for the leading liberal progressives of the Anglo-American world in the nineteenth century. Soci eties without Revolutionaries The experience of this particular sm all country raises a larger general questi on : Why did the parliamentary regimes and rel atively open so­ cieties of the United States, Engla nd, and Switzerland never transf orm their own successful revolutions into broader revolutionary moveme nts ? Why did these lands, which provided so much early inspiration and continuing asylum for foreign revolutionar ies, produce almost no pro­ fessional revolutionary traditions of their own ?

Yet at the"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"--- ---�-- ---- ----------------- ------ ---- -- -- The Evolutionary Alternativ e 203 same time without these two nations a modern revolutionary trad ition is unthinkable. The Puritan Revolution in seventeenth-century England has been called the first \"ecumenic al\" revolution in terms of projecting a universal vision of man and society. 62 England began the Industrial Revolution a cen tury later, and by the early nineteenth cen tury pos­ sessed the world's first indust rial proletariat and a rich bouquet of agitational and journalistic activity. Yet England did not produce a revolutionary tradition-let alone a revolution -of its own in the nine­ teenth century. Nor did the United States, which had sta rted in 1776 the chain of modern political revolutio ns. Despite the revolutionary language of the Declarat ion of Independence and the continuing rhetoric of American politics (with parties using the revolutionary names \"Democratic\" and \"Republican\" ), the United States contributed little of its own to the modern revolutionary tradition. Like England, Americ a absorbed the defeated. Its underpopulated expanses accommodated the utopian ex­ periments of Owen, Fourier, and Cabet- and later the desperate doings of Irish republicans and east European anarch ists. But Americ a pro­ vided Europe with no important revolutionary leadership, ideology, or organization. The feedback from the New World to the Old was prob­ ably greater from South Americ a than from North Amer ica in the nine­ teenth century. The United States appeared in the international revolu­ tionary movement ma inly as the site for the final journ alistic flurries of the Communist League and the final organizational collapse of the First Internati onal. Even this latter event in Philadelphia in 1876 went largely unnoticed amidst the centennial celebrations of the origin al American Revolution. But why did Switzerl and, located in the heart of Europe and closely in touch with revolutionary movements throughout the contine nt, fail to bring forth a revolutionary tradition from its more recent revolution ? Switzerland had given Europe the ideal of William Tell and the ideas of Rousse au. It provided shelter for active revolutionaries from Buonar­ roti in Geneva through Bakunin at Vevey to Lenin in Zuric h. 6 3 It at­ tracted such a large proportion of Slavic revolutionary leaders that the anti-revolutionary Dostoevsky characte rized the entire concept of rev­ olution as the \"Geneva idea.\" 6 4 The fact of a successful past revolution and a measu re of popular represent ation does not altogether explain why Switzerland, England, and Americ a proved so immune to the formation of indigenous new revolutionary organizations or ideologies. The central example of France proves that a relat ively successful revolution and a me asure of suffrage were not necess arily an antidote to the development of a professional revolutionary tradition . France, the site of victorious \"bourgeois\" revo­ lutions in both 1789 and 1830, became the principal breeding grounds for fresh revolutionary ideas and organizations. What then is the crucial difference between England, Americ a, and Switzer land, where r e v o luti ona r y traditions did not develop, and France, Italy, and Poland (as well as other Slavic, Germanic, and Latin lands ), where they did?"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"204 THE DoMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIEs The key difference appears to lie in two common features of the way in which change and opposit ion developed in England, America, and Switze rland. These were nations that, first of all, had previously ex­ perienced and legitimized ideological opposition to medieval Catholicism. They were, in short, nations in which Protestantism was, if not the dominant creed as in Americ a, at least a venerable and coequal one as in Switzerland. Secondly, each of these nations in different ways had found ways to institut ionalize political opposition through an effective system of parties. Whether under a monarch and a centralized parlia­ mentary government as in England or under a federal republic with separation of power as in America and Switzerland, these nations all gave political scope to serious, institutionalized opposition. That oppo­ sition, moreover , assumed the disciplined form of a limited number of political parties-usually two major ones. This is not to say that Protestant rule was not itself intolerant (or indeed bloody, as defeated Irish and Swiss Catholics could attest). Nor was the toleration of political opposition achieved without violence and civil strife at one time or another in all three countries. The in­ stitutionalization of ideological and political opposition was in some sense interrelated with-and expressive of-a peculiar type of dynamic and exploitative economic development taking place in all three coun­ tries. Only those still clinging to the scientistic simplicities of nineteenth-century thought would say categorically that capitalism was the cause and constitutionalism the effect. Karl Marx and Max Weber suggested exactly opposite conclusions about whether Protestantism caused or was caused by capitalism. A similar stand-off could be extracted from the literature about the relationship between the rise of the industrial bourgeoisie and of liberal democracy. But there was also an interrelationship-in which cause and effect are again difficult to disentangle-between the presence of Protestant and parliamenta ry traditions and the absence of revolutionary tradi­ tions in the nineteenth century. Thomas Macaulay, the great troubador of Protestant, parliamentary England, spoke of himself as a man who \"disliked revolutions and for the same reason ... disliked counter­ revoluti ons.\" The passage was cited on the title page of a major treatise by a Hungarian liberal, 6 '' and could well stand as a preface to the history of parliamenta ry progressivism. Later generations have rebelled at Macaulay's self-congratulatory \"whig interpretation of history.\" 66 But his conviction that Protesta ntism and Parliament were the essential an­ tidotes to st agnation and upheaval was widely shared by rising conti­ nental politicians in the nineteenth century. Just as Macaulay spread his ideas not only in Parliament, but through his monumental and readable History of England, so on the continent the liberative powers of Protest antism and parliamentarianism were celebrated by a host of politicized popular historians of civilization beginning with Guizot and Sismondi. Much experience in nineteenth-cen tury Europe supports the argumen t that Protesta ntism and parliament arianism provided a kind of alterna­ tive equivalent to revolution. The countries perhaps most immune in"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"The Evolutionary Alternative ------ ----�------ �� 205 all Europe to native revolutionary movements were the totally Protes­ tant nat ions of Sca ndinav ia, which even developed an elastic, simul­ taneous tolerance for welfare socia lism and monarchy. The low coun­ tries also provide a validating case. Although Holland had experienced an ideological revolution aga inst Spain in the late sixteenth century, a political one in the late eighteenth , and a revolution for independence in 1830, the low countries were tranquil, thereafter, accommodating into the twentieth century both a monarch and a high degree of social controls. All of this was accomplished increment ally with tolerance for legal opposition and vocal dissent. Why then was France so differ ent ? Like England, Americ a, and Swit­ zerland, France had made constitutional gains through revolution : in the charter of 1815 and the constitutional monarchy of 1830. Yet new revolutionary movements appeared after each of these \"victorie s,\" and France became the principal center of revolutionary extremism unt il af­ ter the Paris Commune in 1871 . Jansenists and philosophes had provided France with its own forms of ideological dissent from medieval Cathol­ icism; and the July monarchy had legitimized a me asure of political opposition. But France remained polarized into extreme positions. The attempt to legit imize both ideological and political opposition by Lamennais and the school of Cat holic social reform represented per­ haps the most powerful effort of the 183os to provide a coherent middle way. Yet Lamenn ais , though widely read in the 183os, failed almost totally in his effort to bring the equivalent of Protestantism and of political democracy into Catholic France. Lamennais argued for a kind of socialist version of the Reformation within the Catholic Church. He welcomed the revolutions of 1830 pre­ cisely because they legitimized political opposition in France and Bel­ gium and therefore freed Catholicism from its links with traditional monarchs . He had some immediate influence among moderates in Bel­ gium, 6 7 but little in France prior to receiving posthumous praise from both Christian Democrats and Christian Socialists in the twentieth cen­ tury. For Lamennais was antirevolutionary as well as antiauthoritar­ ian. Although he was never a Protestant and never sat in a parliament, he believed in the need for both a religious opposition within Chris­ tianity and a political opposition within the social order. Without both ideological and political opposition to the status quo, Lamennais feared Europe would either break up through continued civil war between revolutionaries and react ionaries or disintegrate from a loss of all enthusiasm. Like the Protestant revivalists in England , who are often accused of substituting religious for revolutionary fervor among the working classes, Lamennais was a passionate enthusiast. He wrote his first and famous Essa y on Indifference in 1817 specific ally to combat the debilitating trend toward apathy and decay. 6 s If he alter­ nated between his early Catholic conservatism and his later courts hip of revolutionary socialism, he consis tently and above all wanted Europe to share his enthusiasm ; to help create a new ideologic al-politic al op­ position to revitalize an aging civiliz ation.

Unlike Americ a (or Switzerland ), where controversy after the origin al revolution was rapidly ritualized into party politi cs, French politics re­ ma ined polarized. Revolutionaries were consta ntly confronting counter­ revolutionaries outside parliamentary bodi es, which were often seen as bickering arenas for petty secta rians. Moderate ruling fact ions rarely felt secure enough to risk letting opposition parties coalesce-or even to tolerate elections that might risk major changes in the exercise of power. Why was the impact of the two great revolutions of the late eighteenth century so dramatic ally different on the subsequent political history of Amer ica and France respectively? There are of course obvious differ­ ences between the tabula ras a of the New World and the clutter of feudal custom and aristocratic privilege in the ancien regime ; between the reluctant acceptance by England of a revolution partly rooted in historic rights and the revanchist ref usal of traditionalist France to ac­ cept structures created by the French Revolution . It may also be argued that the American Revolution was esse ntially republ ican, whereas the French was democrat ic-a nd thus inherently more extreme. The successful Swiss Revolution followed the American rather than the French pattern of accepting a federalist solution for state organiza­ tion. The moderate Girondist for mula in Switzerland was rejected by central izing Jacobins and Bonapartists alike in France. The Swiss Revo­ lution , like the Americ an, distributed power more succes sfully outside the center than the French. The Swiss and Americans defused the myth of a total revolution to come-both by mythologizing a moderate con­ stitution and by legitimizing political and ideological opposition in the post- revolutionary society. Amer ica and Switzerla nd-a nd to some extent England, the low coun­ tries , and Scandinavia-rejected the basic impulse of the ideological revolutionary tradition towards radical simplific ation. Both the Amer­ ican and the Swiss revolutions were consolidated by building more rather than less complex political system s. They were federal rathe r than centralize d; more people participated in the pro cess; and power tended to be diffused. From the time of the Jacobin attack on the Girond­ ists to Buon arroti's attack on the American system, the French revo­ lutionary trad ition clearly saw the complexity of federalism as a threat to the simplicity of the revolutionary dream. America essentia lly realized in practice the reformi st ideas of the Enlightenment through a process of evoluti on.69 Continental Europe remained throughout the nineteenth century more authoritarian polit­ ically than the British Empire had been under George III in the eigh­ teenth century.

This new class created original systems of thought which may be called ideologies, and eventu ally de­ veloped a new sense of identity (and a term to desc ribe themselv es ) as an \"intellig entsia.\" To be sure, intellectuals were joined at every point by other social and ethnic forces protesting against the conditions of early indust rial­ ization and against political reac tion. But the ferment that led to revo­ lution in 1848--w hatever the final causes--was clea rly dominated by intel lectuals. They bore the cont agion from their studies into the streets, from banquets to barric ades, and across national borders . They popu­ larized, legit imize d, and internationalized the revolutionary impulse. A thousand studies rem ain to be made about the sociology and psy­ chology of this new social for ce. 1 But the first task for a history of revolutionary movements is to isolate those systems of thought that were most decisive in developing revolution ary commitment among in­ tellectuals in the early nineteenth cen tury ; to trace the genesis of those new spiritual creations known as ideolo gies. Ideologies have been defined as \"the integrated asse rtio ns, theories and aims that constitute a socio-political program. \" They \"conceptu alize the historical process and orient human beings for sha ping it \" by creat­ ing \"a progra m of collective action\" from a \"coherent system of sym-"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Prophecy: The Emergence of an Intelligen tsia 209 bois.\" 2 They are in many ways a modern form of religi on- all­ inclusive in scope, universal in applicat ion , historical in focus. To determine which of these systems in the romantic period was most revo­ lutionary, one may begin with Lenin's distinction between the ideol­ ogies of revolutionaries and revolutionary ideology. Any inventory of the former in nineteenth-century Europe would have to include repub­ licanis m, national ism, Fourier ism , Owenism, Christian messianism, anarchism, populism, and even spir itualism. But few of these were inherently revolutionary ideologies with universal applicability and a clear concept of how present conflict would lead to future happi ness. None of these \"ism's\" offered a clear, secular conception of how history worked and how it could provide both intellectual secur ity and strategic guidance for revolutionaries. Two of the new syste ms-t hose of Saint-Simon and Hegel- offered just such a view of history, and t hese two systems provided the princi­ pal sources of modern revolutionar y ideology. Although the ideologies developed only after their deaths, Saint-Simon and Hegel generated the original ideas that spread across national and cultural bound aries to atta in nearly universal appeal in an age of national ism. There are some parallels between the radic ally different thought­ worlds of the French aristocrat and the German professor. Each sought to update the Enlightenment faith in the underlying laws of nature with a new belief in the dynamic laws of history. Each attracted am­ bitious young intellectuals with the ideal of a new activist elite. The following of each increased after the mas ter's death (Saint-Simon in 1825, Hegel in 1832), for their respective impact was one of ideas rather than person alitie s. Each of these ideas gave rise to a school of thought that took a path ironically different from the one envisaged by the mas ter. Both Saint­ Simon and Hegel had developed new views of the world precisely to end revolutionary disruption ; yet their followers were at the forefront of re­ newed revolutionary agitation. Although the influence of both Saint­ Simon and Hegel was protean and dive rse , it was most decisive on revolutionar ies. The impact of both men converged on Karl Marx. If both Saint-Simon and Hegel were deeply conditioned by the events of the French Revolution, each first articulated his major ideas in the shadow of Na poleon. Each was in some ways an imperi alist of the mind, seeking to fulfill in the realm of ideas the universal dominion that Na poleon seemed to have est ablished in the ma terial world. At the age of forty-two Saint-Simon turned from a life of financial speculation and aristocratic adventur e to one of intellectual specul ation and adventu re. He did so in direct response to the assumed needs of Napoleon, who had just proclaimed himself emperor. Saint-Simon's first serious composition was a proposed curriculum for the new system of thirty lyceums th at Napoleon had projected as the basis for civic education 3 and his first major published work an anonymous proposal of I8o2-03, addressed directly to Napoleon, for a plan for perpetual peace during the hiatus in warfare that followed the treaty of Amien s.4 Hegel's first major writing was done in these same years, following"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"- -- --�----- 210 T HE D oMINANCE OF THE N ATIONAL R EVOLUTIONARIES his ac ademic appointment at Jena in 1801. His great ideologic al trea­ tise, The Phenomenology of Mind (or Spirit ), was written as a kind of intellectual counter point to the Na poleonic military conquest of Ger­ many. It was completed with cannon sounding in the background from the battle at Jena, where Na poleon crushed Prussi a. Hegel's philosophy in some ways constituted a revenge of German thought against victorious French power. Saint-Simon's writings on the other hand represented a subtler dra ma : the first \"ideologists\" reveng­ ing themselves against a political system that had rejected them . The Saint-Simonians Largely neglected recent research indic ates that revolutionary Babeuvists and Philadelphians may have exercised a direct influence on Henri de Saint-Simon during the first decade of the nineteenth century. Long stud­ ied largely as an influence on later revolutionar ies, Saint-Simon should also be seen as a figure who was himself perhaps in turn directly in­ fluenced by the first conspirators of the Na poleonic era. The crucial link in the apostolic success ion from the Babeuf Conspir­ acy to the birth of ideology under Saint-Simon is provided by a minor revolutionary playwright and editor, Jacques Rigomer-B azin, with whom Saint-Simon lived in Paris at several important points during this de­ cade. Bazin may have been linked with Bonn eville's Social Circle and was almost certainly connected to the Babeuf Conspiracy while still working as a revolutionary journalist in provincial Le Mans .5 After moving to Paris, he became close to Marechal and other survivors of the conspiracy through a circle of radical intellectuals which began to meet regularly at the Cafe Manege in 1799. The Paris police arrested Bazin in May 1804, and confiscated his Sketch for a new plan of social organization, which apparently called for an authoritarian elite of thirty savants to help the poor and create social equ ality. 6 Bazin was living with Saint-Simon at the time of his arrest; and the latter clearly borrowed extensively from Bazin in his writings of this period. His Letter of an Inhabitant of Geneva ( 1802-3) called for twenty-one men of genius to open a subscr iption before the tomb of Newton and begin the scient ific reorganization of society. His next work of 1804 adopted the very title of Bazin's confiscated work, adding to Bazin's previous call for a scientific elite an idea shortly to be de­ veloped more fully by Bazin : the artist should be the moralist of the new scien tific era; and a new type of writer, the litterateur, its propagand ist. 7 Bazin played just such a role when he reappeared after his release from prison in 1807 as editor of a new journal Lettres philosophiques, which attacked the Catholics and strongly defended Marechal on beh alf of \"the"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Prophecy: The Emergence of an Intelligentsia 211 party which persists in providing instruction in the progress of philos­ o phy.\" s The journa l ostensibly sought to \"open a public correspondence among philosophers\" ; 9 but it appears in fact to have been a medium for communic ation (and perhaps even coded mess ages ) among revolu­ tionary Philadelphi ans. Bazin was one of their leaders. He signed a ma­ jor article, \"Dialogue on Philosophy,\" with the name Philadelphe; and the list of 250 subs cribers included most leading revolutionaries of the era in an aggregate sum consonant with the society's organiz ation into five-man cells. The supposition seems reasonable that Lettres was sim­ ply an open organ for a secret conspir acy. 10 In the last issue of his journal, Bazin issued the classic cry of the alienated intell ectual; restless with abstract pursuit s, anxious for polit­ ical relevance, and possessed with his own missionary import ance, he announced that he was giving up philosophy altogether for 0 0 0 un plan d'une plus grande etend ue; j'ouvre un plus vaste champ a la critique ... sur tous les points de la Republique des Lettres. ll Ba zin's new journal that was to realize this mission never appea red ; he was arrested in the wake of the first conspiracy of Malet in I 8o8. Released from prison in I809, Bazin lived secretly and illega lly once again with Saint-Simon, who helped him esc ape into exile. 1 2 Though their paths did not apparently cross again,IB Bazin clea rly provided in this formative period both a personal and an ideological inspirat ion for Saint-Simon's vision of an elite of intellectuals transforming not just politic s, but all of human society and culture. To trace the birth of revolutionary ideology one must distinguish between two successi ve phases of the Saint-Simonian moveme nt : the scientistic and the romantic . The first, scientistic period occupied the last twenty-five years of Saint-Simon's life, which was the first quarter of the nineteenth century. It represented in essence a re affirm ation of the eighteenth-c entury belief in rat ional , secular progres s. The second, romantic phase unfolded during the decade after the mast er's death in 18 25. Following the invocation in his final work, The New Christianity, Saint-Simon's disciples created a fantastic new secular religion with global perspectives that foreshadowed many aspects of twentieth-century thought. A Science of Man The scientistic phase of Saint-Simonian thinking grew directly out of the activities of the first people to call themselves \"ideolog ists.\" Destutt de Tracy, who first popularized the term \"ideology\" in I 796- 97, 1 4 sug ­ gested in the first part of his Elements of Ideology in I80I that tra­ ditional meta physics must be superseded by \"ideology,\" a new method of observing facts , inferr ing consequences, and accepting nothing not suggested directly by sensation. Building on the tradition of Locke, and of Condillac's Treatise on Sens ation of I775, de Tracy ma intained that all thinking and feeling were physical sens ations in the strictest sense"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"- - --- ---�-- --· - - 212 T HE D OMINANCE OF THE N ATIONAL R EVOLUTIONARIE S of the word. \"Ideology is a part of zoology,\" he wrote with a cert ain polemic zest. 1 5 Ha ppiness is merely the free play of the organs. As his closest collaborator put it : \"The brain digests impressions and secretes thought.\" 1 6 Henri de Saint-Simon extended this radical empiricism into the alto­ gether new field of social relations. Ha ving spent eleven months in prison during the Reign of Terror, expecting death at any moment, Saint-Simon had a deep fear of revolution. He dreamed of founding a new science of man as a means bot h to overcome disorder and to remove the overgrowth of false politic al rhetoric which concealed the real, ma­ terial que stions of society. 1 7 Thus, ironic ally, this aristocrat of the an­ cien regime seeking to provide (in the words of one of his titles ) the means for bringing an end to the revolution, lB ended up popul arizing the most revolutionary of all modern ideas : there can be a science of human relations. Saint-Simon's ideas fell on receptive ears because the original \"ideolo­ gists\" around de Tracy 19 popul arized not just a method of analysis but also a vision of society. Among de Tracy's friends within the Second Sect ion of the newly created Ins titute (devoted to moral and political scien ce ), there had grown up in the I 79os the heady belief that the development and application of a new science of humanity could be the supreme creation of the revolutionary era. The journal that popu­ larized this belief in the practica l power of science was the influential Deca de philosophique, litteraire et politique founded in 17 94, the year of the Thermidorean reaction. After five years of a tempestuous revolu­ tion, this jou rnal and the newly created Second Sect ion of the Institute had sought to focus attention on peaceful, ped agogic changes for the \"philo sophical decade\" ahead. The controlling group , which de Tracy and Cabanis called ideologiste, argued that the key to diagnosing and curing the ills of humanity lay in an objective understanding of the physiological realities that lay be­ hind all thinking and feelin g. They were encouraged by the rise of Na­ poleon ; for he had assembled a kind of institute in exile during his cam­ paign in Egypt, surrounding himself with scientists and asking de Tracy and others to join him there. On his return to France, Na poleon a c­ cepted membership in the First Section of the Institute, which dealt with the natural sciences. He visited Helvetius's widow, a kind of salon mot her to the ideologis ts. De Tracy's group was led to believe that a \"revolutionary aca demy\" might replace popular sovereignty. The first outline of his Elements of Ideology in I8oi was designed for use in the new republican schools they expected from Na poleon .2 o Once sec urely in power, however, Na poleon became suspicious of the ideologistes, denouncing them as ideologues. 2 1 He dissolved the Second Sect ion of the Institute in 1803, forcing these original ideologists into a kind of party of opposition to the emperor. When the daughter of de Tracy married the son of Lafayette, the philosophical and political op­ position were joined. The struggle between Na poleon and the ideologistes deeply disturbed"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Prophecy: The Emergence of an Intelligentsia 213 both sides-pe rhaps because each secretly admired the other. Na poleon was a compulsive writer and a would-be intellectual who never had the time to develop these inclinations in himself. The ideologistes had a clea r thirst for the power that Na poleon seemed to have denied them. Many of them had caught a glimpse in the revolution ary era of an exhilaratin g, active life in which they might simultaneously debate ideas and shape events. As imperial res triction descended on their acad­ emies and journals, the ideologists felt empty and depriv ed; and their distress was no less keen for being spiritual rather than ma terial. Saint-Simon provided a broad battle plan for the intellectual opposi­ tion. The combat leaders were to be the new politicized journa lists whom he called litterateurs in his Sketch of I 804 and publicistes subse­ quently. Scientific indoctrination and intellectual unity were to be pro­ vided in a new \"positive encyclopedia\" on which he worked from 18og to 1813. 22 His Essay on the Science of Man in 1813 suggested that every field of knowledge moved successi vely from a conjec tural to a \"positive\" stage, and that the sciences reached this stage in a definite order.23 Physiology had now moved into a positive stage, just as as­ trology and alchemy had previously given way to astronomy and chem­ istry. Now the science of man must move towards the positive stage and completely reorganize all human instituti ons . In a sense, Saint-Simon was only reviving the Enlightenment vision of humanity advancing through three success ive stages to a scientific ordering of life (in Turgot's Discourse on Universal History of 1760); and of universal progress towards rational order (in Condorcet's Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Huma n Mind, written in hiding shortly before his death in 1794 ). But just as the revolution ary regime condemned Condorc et, so Na­ poleon shut the Second Section of the Institute. Saint�Simon was forced to publish his early proposals anonymously and usu ally outside the borders of the Napoleonic Empire. Thus, Na poleon, who had helped inspire the quest for a science of man, also began the process of driv­ ing it into social revolutionary paths. 2 4 Bel ieving that the scient ific method should be applied to the body of society as well as to the in­ dividual body, Saint-Simon proceeded to analyze society in terms of its physiological components : classes. He never conceived of economic classes in the Marxian sense, but his functional class analysis prepared the way for Marx. The key problem at each stage in Saint-Simon's successive efforts at social analysis was to determine which social force was capable of ap­ plying science to society. During the Na poleonic period he divided so­ ciety into property owners , workers , and savants, placing all his hope in the latter group's disinterested approach to human affairs . He thoug ht that property owners could be persuaded to see that the savants were natural leaders able to steer humanity away from a revolution ary dis­ ruption of the social order. During the restoration Saint-Simon divided society into two fundamen­ tal grou ps : industrials and idlers .

He idealized the industriels out of re­ spect not for their ownership of property but for their powers of pro­ duction . Work was liberative ; the beaver and not the lion should be the king of beasts. In his Letters to the Industriels and other articles 2 5 during this period, he envisaged an end to revolution through a new religion with a single commandmen t: \"All men must work .\" There were idlers ( oisifs ) and indust rious ones ( indus triels ) within all social group s. The new elite was thus to be drawn from whoever was industrious in agriculture , commerce, ma nufacturing, and banking regardless of so­ cial origi ns. Sa int-Simon was the prophet of meritocracy, seeking to re­ order society in the image of the new chessboa rd he had designed for revolutionary Franc e, with a hierarchy in which the king was replaced by a figure called Talent. Ha ving failed, however, to win over the industr ialists, Saint-Simon turned to one last force for revolution ary support in his last years, I 824- 25 : \"the most numerous and poorest class.\" He addressed to the self-proclaimed spiritual lead ers of the \"holy alliance\" his final plea for a \"New Christianity\" of morality without metaphysics, technology with­ out theology. This alone could keep the urban poor from returning to the false god of revoluti on. \"Listen to the voice of God spe aking through my mouth,\" he proclaimed with charact eristic lack of modesty in the final words of his last work addressed to the political heads of Euro pe : Turn to true Christianity again, ... Fulfill all the duties it imposes on the powerful. Remember that it commands them to devote all their strength to the swiftest possible amelioration of the lot of the poor. 26 Saint-Simon promised to ela borate fully the nature of the \"New Chris­ tianity .\" But he died in 1825 and never had a chance to go beyond suggesting that it would resemble heretical Christian sects of the past and would reorganize society to benefit the poor. Saint-Simon was a truly seminal intellectual for ce : a father of social­ ism as well as sociology, and a John the Baptist of revolution ary ideol­ ogy, crying out in the wilder ness of the Napoleonic and restoration eras for a new historicism and moral relativism. Saint-Simon was one of the first to popula rize the distinctiv e nineteenth-century belief that truth is not absolute but histor ical, and is realized not in individual thought but in social action. He was one of the first continental thinkers to contend that the Industrial Revolution was more important than the political revolution in France. The key fac tors in history for him were tools and technological revoluti ons. Archimedes was greater than Alexander ; Newton than Na poleon . The real forces for change in modern society, t he industriels, far from being aided by the political changes in Fra nce, were now burdened with a second group of nonproductive oisifs : new politicians alongside old priests."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Prophecy: The Emergence of an Intelligentsia 21 5 The bourgeoisie was for Saint-Simon hardly less parasitical than the idle aristocrats of the ancien regime. He rejected liberalism (which soon won over some of his closest friends such as Augustin Thierry ) as a neg ative and critical movement, incap able of reunifying ma nkind, incompatible with the new positive age of science. He accorded eco­ nomics prim acy over polit ics, physiology over met aphysic s. Govern­ ment was a social function appropriate to the meta physical stage of history and was now to be replaced by a rational social organization suitable for the exploitation of nature. The rule of man over man was always oppressive ; the rule of men over things , liberative. Even in his most political propo sal, his Reorganization of European Society in r8r4 , he urged a clean break with past political systems in favor of a new Economic Parliament of Europe and a trans-n ational authority to unify Europe through vast public works such as a Danube -Rhine and Rhine­ Baltic Canal. Political authority was to be replaced by social authority in his tech­ nocratic utopi a. It was to be administered by three chambers : Inven­ tions run by engineers , Review run by scient ists, and Execution run by industrial ists. A supreme college was to draw up physical and moral laws; and two even higher academ ies , Reasoning and Sentiment, were to be filled by a new breed of propa gandist ic writer and artist. Saint-Simon's final call for a new religion represented the culmina­ tion of the ideologiste attempt to supplant all religion by absorbing it into a progressive scheme of secular evolution. In his commentary of r8o2 Franc;ois Dupuis's The Origin of All the Cults of Universal Reli­ gion 2 7 de Tracy suggested that past religions were not simply senseless superstition, but rather a kind of scient ific baby talk : the generalized expression in imprecise language of the scient ific thought of the age. Religious ritual was, moreover, socia lly necessa ry to dramatize scien­ tific principles for still-ignorant people . Saint-Simon viewed his New Chris tianity as just such a neces sity for the masses. His death left it unclear whether this faith was designed to provide the moral basis for the new social order or merely an interim faith until the masses were educated to accept a totally scientistic system. Saint-Simon more than any other figure of his generation excited young Europeans about the liberative possib ilities of industry and about reaching salva tion throug h knowledge and mast ery, not belief and mys­ tery. After the failure of their conspiracies in the early r82os, radical youth found both consolat ion and a new direction in Saint-Simonian ideology. They reas sembled in sma ll discussion groups, form ing \"a con­ gress of philosophers charged with discussing everything that had been left out of the one at Vienn a.\" 2 8 They were exhil arated both by the new sense of history filtering in from German philosophy and by the study of economics filtering in from England. These interests led to a new appreciation of Saint-Simon . Some directly transferred from Car­ bonari conspiracies to Saint-Simonian circles, leading one of the best memoirists of the period to charact erize Saint-Simonianism as simply \"religio us carbon arism .\" 2 9"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"21 6 T HE D OMINANCE OF THE N ATIONAL R EVOLUTIONARIES The enormous posthumous influence of Saint-Simon stretched from Russia and Poland to Latin Americ a-eventua lly reaching the Near and even Far East.3 0 His teachings helped form a radical intellectual elite both in Germany (which he considered \"infinitely superior in its char­ acter, science and philosoph y\" ) 31 and in Russia (which he praised as \"not yet withered up by sce pticism\" ).3 2 He influenced the lonely pio­ neer of Scandinavian socialist thought, young Swedish printer Per Gotrek, who translated and popularized Saint-Simonian tracts before turning to Cabet and the Communist Manif esto.33 Saint-Simon produced a permanent impact on bankers and on railroad and canal builders,34 imparting the vision to look beyond immediate obsta cles and traditional inhibiti ons. But the greatest Saint-Simonian influence lay within France, first of all on the positivist tradition developed by his friend and sometime pupil Auguste Comte.35 Comte perpetuated the search for a science of society through a thr ee-staged theory of progre ss, which he derived from Saint-Simon in 1822. Comte's idea that ma nkind moved from a \"theologic al\" through a \"metaphysic al\" to a \"positive\" era encouraged a certain indifference to democratic politics (a phenomenon of the passing second sta ge ). Though esse ntially apoliti cal, positivism had authorit arian implic a­ tions-relying on intellectual authority rather than on the random play of vulga r pressures. The link between enlightenment and despotism in the eighteenth century was not entirely accidental. Saint-Simon had consistently appealed to monarchical authority from his first petitions to Na poleon until his last appeal for a \"New Christianity\" to the leaders of the Holy Allianc e. Saint-Simonians on several occ asions sought out Metternic h, who exp ressed admiration for their doct rine and met at length with Michael Chevalier in I835.3 6 Auguste Comte was later to appeal for the adoption of his \"System of Positive Politics\" to the two most authoritarian potentates in Europ e: the Russian tsar and the Turkish sultan.37 Comte's positivism was perhaps most influential in the courts of antidemocratic regimes in Latin Amer ica and the Near East . M ore important than Saint-Simon's influence on sociology was his im­ pact on socialism. His followers in the 183os first gave widespread use not only to the word \"socialism,\" but also-in the course of 1831 alon e-to \"socialize,\" \"socialization,\" and socializing the instruments of labor.38 These usages were at times only an extension of older Saint­ Simonian terms like orga nization and association, but they carried new suggestions of social control and of challenge to liberal individualism. The first hist oria:Q of socialism , Louis Reyb aud, prophesied in 1836, just after the seeming disa ppe arance of the Saint-Simoni ans, that they ... will be to the social future what a trial balloon is to aeronautical experi­ ence. The trial ba lloon swells up before the eyes of an astonished crowd, rises, grows smaller and smaller, is lost in space.

This \"school of many crafts\" had trained the engineers and technicians for the revolutionary and Na poleonic armies and was a model of the new antitraditional institution open to talent and dedicated to practical accomplishment. Social revolutionar y Saint-Simonianism was begun by two young stu­ dents from the Ecole Polytechnique : Olinde Rodrigu es, the son of a Jewish banker from Bordeaux, and his young mathematics student, who had fought for Na poleon in the Hundred Days and spent 182 1-23 in St. Petersburg, Barthelemy Prosper Enfant in.4 0 These two polytech­ nicians joined with former French Carbonari like Bazard and Buchez to edit Le Producte ur, in 1825-26, and then in 1828 drew up a systemat ic Exposition of Saint-Simon's doctrine. These Saint-Simonians introduced the phrase \"the exploitation of man by man\" and the concept of class conflict arising out of \"the relationship of the workers with the owners of the instruments of labor.\" 4 1 But it was not until renewed revolutionary hopes in 1830 gave way once more to disillusionment that the Saint-Simonian cult truly fl ow­ ered. The liberal daily The Globe, edited by Pierre Leroux, converted to the new belief in 1831, and a weekly Organisateur and the first of a nationwide system of temples of humanity were founded. With these developmen ts, Saint-Simonianism became a mass phenomenon. Gaining at its height perhaps forty thousand French adherents or sympat hizers , Saint-Simonianism developed links with prominent intellec tual leaders throughout Europe in the 183os -ranging from Heine to Goethe in Germ any, from the liberal Mill to the conse rvative Carlyle in England.4 2 Franz Liszt was an active member, playing the piano at some of the sect's gatherin gs. The Saint-Simonians briefly tried to open a new Saint-Simonian college on Christmas Day, 1829, before turning to their temples of humanity in 1831. They were harassed in Paris by governmental restrictions and rumors of scandalous sexual license. When Leroux left The Globe later in 1831, and the journal collapsed in the following year, there was a need for a new source of revelation and place of worship . The Saint-Simonians found both the source and the place by withdraw­ ing in the summer of 1832 into a celib ate, communal retreat on Enfan­ tin's family estate at Menil montant in the outskirts of Paris. There at 10 P.M. on Bast ille Day, the long-haired \"father\" Enfantin gathered seven of his favorite \"children\" for their first of four long ses sion s, re­ vealing his New Book : a series of mystical aphorisms suggesting how science was to be applied to society. Rich in Pythagorean number myst i­ cism, Enfantin's revelation concentrated on triadic formulas for the new \"organic era.\" There was the coming harmony of sentiment, industry, and intell ect; of the spiritu al, mat erial, and ration al; and of the worker (a plane ), the theorist (a line ), and the apostle (a three-dimensional solid ).43 The commune under Enfantin was short-lived, memorable largely for"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"21 8 THE DoMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES such customs as the we aring of vests buttoned in the back to enforce dependence on one's fellow man. Their subsequent search for a female Messiah in Egypt was even more bizarre . Yet such efforts represented only the excesses of a general European infatu ation with new ideolo­ gies, offering hope after the failure of revolutions in the early 182os and in 1830 to produce a new social order. Saint-Simonianism contained the implied promise that those involved in its discussions were to be the elite of the new age. Indeed, they can perhaps be considered the first modern \"intelligentsia\" in the sense de­ fined by Karl Mannheim : a new, classless element free of either the Church control of the past or the regional and class biases of the fu­ ture ; and able to impart a \"dynamic and elastic\" qua lity to thought while forcing ideas into the political arena. This \"free intelligentsia\" was dest ine d, in Ma nnheim's hopeful view,44 to produce a society free of prejudice and directed towards rational social goals. The Saint­ Simonians for the most part viewed themselves as doing precisely that. Romantic Global ism The Saint-Simonians of the 183os developed plans that exceeded even those of the master, who had dreamed of himself as a new Charle­ magne and of him and Mme. de Stael giving birth to a new Messiah. His romantic followers fantasized projects for the rejuvenat ion of Oceania, India, and Chin a,4\" and launched subst antial movements in eastern Europe, the Near East, and Latin Americ a. Saint-Simonian ideas provided new hope for Spaniards exiled in Gibraltar as well as Argen­ tineans exiled in Urugua y.4 6 Chevalier, the head of the Saint-Simonian religion in Paris, scouted out terrain in Russia and North Afr ica, North and South Americ a. He wrote a detailed plan for the minute republic of Ando rra,4 7 advocating a kind of omnibus pilgrim age to all the cities frequented by Moses, Jesus, and Mohamm ed.48 But the enduring historical impo rtance of the Saint-Simonians lies not so much in their impact on specific groups as in their general effect in quickening expectat ions throughout the European world. More than any other system of thought, Saint-Simonianism inspired restless revolution­ aries with fresh hope in the early 1830s, a time when disillusionment was growing not just with revolution but with the Enlightenment belief in natural laws. As the French Revolution of 1830 trailed off into petty political bickering under a constitutional monarchy, Enfantin and Haz­ ard's Judgment of the doc trine of Saint-Simon on the most recent events proclaimed that \"in the presence of the impotence and inco­ herence of the parties, only the Saint-Simonians possess a logical solu­ tion to the difficulti es.\" 49 Saint-Simonianism promised a universal social transformation. The old political revolutions had grown out of French civiliz ation, based on the archetype of 1789- 93.

Na poleon's Egyptian camp aign in the 1790s had introduced the printing press and new ideas into the old civilizations of the Afro -Asian world. In like manner, the Saint­ Simonian heg ira to the East after their failures in France led to the founding of the first polytechnical school outside Europe (in Egypt in 1834 ),54 and to the first export of revolutionary ideology beyond the tra­ ditional confines of European civiliz ation. Canning had described the British naval support of revolutions in the Americas in the 182os as \"calling the new world into being to redress the balance of the old.\" The Saint-Simonian move into the East in the 183os attempted in a sm aller way to call upon the ancient world to redress the failure of social revolution in con temporary Eur ope. Though there was little re­ sponse, the stirrin gs of the Saint-Simonians in the East were prophetic of things to come. The Saint-Simonians' eastwa rd voyage in 1833 after their failure in France broke the usual nineteenth-century pat tern . Revolution aries in search of a new start had previously gone west to Americ a. Saint-Simon himself had first been stimulated to global perspectives by his experi­ ences as an eighteen-ye ar-old particip ant in the American Revolution in 1778 and as a would-be builder of a canal to join the oceans through Mexico. Michael Chevalier returned to the ma ster's original source of inspiration to ma ke a new appraisal in 1832-35 of the prospects for Saint-Simonianism in Americ a, Mexico, and Cuba. 55 Chevalier, however, moved east to those original cradles of civilization that had not yet distorted the revolution ary faith. His Mediterranean System in The Globe 56 saw peace ful industrial progress reaching out from the Mediterranean via a web of railroads into Asia and Africa as well as Europe . The \"sea among the lands\" which had cradled wars in the past would now become \"the nuptial bed of East and West,\" 57 the forum for a \"universal associat ion\" of all peoples. Along with the railro ads, two critical canals were needed to increase the worldwide interdependen ce. The same Globe in the same month set forth the first call for a canal through Panama to connect the Atlantic and Paci fic following an earlier Saint-Simonian call for a canal to link Europe and Asia through Suez. They also called for a high dam on the Nile. Chev alier suggested that the fundamental conflict in the world was between East and West. But unlike Kipling and the heroic pessimists of a later age, the Saint-Simonians felt that the twain did in fact meet in Egypt.

The \"univers al associ ation\" of all peoples through the canal was conceived in the same sexual terms as the cultural intercourse to be consummated in the \"nuptial bed\" of the Mediter ranean. 6 1 Nothing less than their own virility seemed to be at stake. Upon his release from prison, Enfantin communicated the order to go east on August 8, 1833, in rhapsodic , erotic verse : Suez Est le centre de notre vie de travail La nous ferons l' acte Que le monde attend Pour confesser que nous sommes Males. 62 Physical labor wedded a mascu line humanity with a feminine earth : le peuple with le monde .6B Universal signific ance was thus attributed to the simple act of intellectuals doing a little work. \"The people,\" who of course had been performing such labor all along, were patronizingly described as the dependent children in the Saint-Simonian \"family.\" The people is our family, let us engender them by work, let us embrace, caress the earth ... let us await the milk of the Woman, but let us men prepare the bread! 6 4 God himself was feminine as well as mas culine, 6 5 drawing people in to reunion with nature (and a share of divini ty) by a kind of uni­ versal libi do : Cette electricite vaga bonde qui circulait du monde a l'assemblee et de l'assemblee au monde et qui traversait les corps sans se fixer . ... n 6 The Saint-Simonians viewed the couple-pretre of man and woman as the new social micro cosm, replacing the atomized indivi dual, and they extended sexual imagery to the macrocosm, the entire world.

The future will pro­ vide the benefits, as it were , of both recole polytechnique and l'amour polymorph ique. Each will complete his experiences in the life of others , then flow into the lives of all and ultimately perpetuate life itself into eternity -so argued Enfantin in his last work, La Vie eterne lle.68 He lifted the older Saint-Simonian idea of transmigration (palin-gene sis) of souls 69 to its highest level, prophesying both the technological trans­ formation of the earth and the biological creation of a new, androgy­ nous humanity. The mystical excesses and eastern adventures of Saint-Simonianism deserve attention not solely as data for psycho-sexual investigation. For their eastern expedition may be the first major, organized effort of western, urban intellectuals to apply a secular ideology for radical social change to an idealized, underdeveloped are a. Egypt appealed to the Saint-Simonians' Na poleonic delusio ns. They appe ar to have believed that they might ultimately return to France from Egypt triumphant and vindicated as Bon aparte had to save an earlier revolution from disinte­ gration. But in place of Na poleon's military victories in the East, the Saint-Simonians saw themselves winning technological triumphs as a prelude to their return . They would lead France not to a short-lived imperial glory, but to an unending age of industrial prosperity. The First Black Muslim: Urbain This first call to look East for the light of revolution that had faded in the West found a response in the New World from a gifted member of the group most oppressed in the Amer icas : the black slaves. Thomas Urbain, one of eight mulatto children born by the black second wife of a French planter and slave trader is perhaps the most interesting and neglected of the original Saint-Simonians. His vision of using the Sai nt­ Simonian religion to liberate black people was, in a way, the last des­ perate effort of West Indian blacks to find in French culture the liber­ ation promised by the revolt of Touss aint L'Ouverture. At the same time, the journey of Urbain back to an Afr ica from which he never returned represents the first in a long line of returns to Africa from the New World (and mostly from the West Indies ) by black revolution aries : Padmore, Blyden, Dubois, Fanon, Malcolm X, and Carmichael. But for Urbain, the island remained a kind of paradise lost in his later memories of \"the sweetness of creole and family life\" and of the young black girl \"who initiated me into the first raptures of love in a large woods.\" 70 When he went to France with his father to study medicine, he adopted as a surname the Christian name of his father, Urbain, and was called Thomas by his schoolma tes . 71 Isolated and uncert ain of his identity, he was converted to the new religious Saint-Simonianism before he was twenty, went through the monast ic phase at Menilmon tant, wan­ dered by foot across Corsica with other Saint - S i m on i an s , and finally headed east with the Compa nions of the Woman, landing near Con­ stantinople in April 1833.7 2"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"222 THE DoMI NANCE oF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES When he eventua lly arrived in Egypt, he instinctively \"felt himself to be an orien tal,\" 73 and he became a te acher of languages in Damietta and a convert to Islam. The plague of 1835, which turned some Saint-Simonians like the fem­ inist Suzanne Voilquin to hashish, led Urbain away from drink and the \"explosion of sensu ality\" into a new life as a Muslim. He was im­ pressed by their tolerant attitude toward race and the solidity of Mus­ lim family life 74- and perhaps also disillusioned by reports from other Saint-Simonians that even isolated groups like the Ma labar Christians of India had not preserved the hoped-for island of purity in man-woman relations within Christend om.75 He found at last a name of his own, that of the prophet !small, who had also been the son of a slave aban­ doned by his father, but had allegedly \"discovered a source of water near Mecc a.\" 7 6 In Alger ia, newly colonized by the French, Urbain found his \"oasis\" in the shadow of Enfantin, \"the gigantic palm tree in my desert,\" 77 who arrived in 1839 with a scientific commission. Urbain, who had moved there in 1837, began a long career as official milit ary interpreter to a series of high French officials beg inning with the Duke of Orlea ns 7 8 and ending with Napoleon III. Urbain believed that he had been chosen to mediate between East and West; and that the link that he person ally represented between the French and the Arabs stood at the pivotal point of a coming reconci liation . \"The day is coming,\" he proclaimed to the Arabs ... when you will place yourself in the midst of the nations to demand an accounting from them of the riches you have deposited in their midst. The Orient and the Occident belong to God and he is pushing the one toward the other.79 Urbain immersed himself in linguistic and ethnographic studies of his adopted land. Enfantin's image of reconciling the East and the West seemed in a way to be taking place in Algeria through Urbain, who was half black, half white, \"embracing Islam without renouncing Chris­ tianity,\" 80 writin g poe try in both French and Arabic . In 1839 Urbain added a vision of reconciliation between the races to the Saint-Simonian repertoire of conflicts to be resolved in the coming \"univers al associat ion\" of peop les . The Letters on the black race and the white race, which he exchanged with the Jewish Saint-Simonian Gus­ tave d'Eichtal, suggest racial rec onciliat ion through the creation of a new mulatto race. Eichtal was clea rly fascinated by his personal rela­ tionship with Urbain, which had led to collaboration on The Two Worlds in 1836-39, a work app arently lost. 8 I Eichtal saw his link with Urbain as that of \"the black and the Jew : the two outcasts, the two prophets !\" and saw the liberation of the two peoples as deeply inter­ related. 8 2 The conversion of blacks like Urbain to Islam was an impor­ tant first step as it made them \"members of the great family of Abra­ ham\" and offered via the Koran \"the initiation of the black to the book.\" 8 3 Eichtal transferred the charact eristic romantic glorifi cation of the unspoiled \"people\" directly to the blacks : \"La race noire c'est le"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Prophecy: The Emergence of an Intelligentsia 22 3 monde sauvage de Rousseau .... \" 84 The blending of the races in the Hispanic world (which has gone on from the time of the Moors to present-day Cu ba) was seen as a model of the future in the third and last of the Letters .85 The coming mulatto humanity was to be the product of the direct erotic fusion of divided races and sexes. Urbain seemed to accept Eichtal's view that the new chosen people should begin forging their \"alliance of zoology with history\" 86 in Al­ geri a. Efforts to est ablish a new Franco-Arabian college and the pro-Arab Colonization of Algeria, which Enfantin published in 1843 on the basis of notes by Urbain, repre sented the last common effort of the Saint­ Simonians to find a place on earth for the immediate transformation of the human condition. The mast er's final hopes for a \"new Christian­ ity\" bec ame transferred into the pupils' interest in what might be called a \"new Islam.\" Eichtal developed this idea in The present and future of Islam in Central Africa.87 The very title of the new French-l anguage journal founded in 1844 summa rized the new geopolitical vision of these Saint-Simonia ns : Algeria: courier of Africa, the Orient and the Mediterrane an. 88 Urbain was in Paris during the Revolution of 1848. Caught up in \"the revolutionary fever,\" he served with Eichtal in a u nit of the Na tional Guard commanded by Rodr igues.89 The leading Saint-Simonian contri­ bution to revolutionary events in Algeria was the brilliant defense of the leading indigenous revolution ary organization, the Children of Car­ thage, by the original lead er of the Saint-Simonian pilgrimage to the East : Emile Barrault. 9 0 He lectured the defendants even as he pleaded their case , pointing out the dangers of fantasm agorie revolutionnaire in an atmosphere of conspi racy : \"Si la democratie conspire, elle ab­ dique .\" 91 Most of the European community in Algeria were persuaded by his argument that the revolutionaries were largely a harmless anach­ ronism. They received a light sentence, and the prestige of the Saint­ Simonian group was enhanced in Algeria. However, their activities in the antirevolutionary, pos t-romantic 185os largely involved either tech­ nocratic development or cultural bridge-buildin g-w ith Urbain the leading advocate of the latter. After a long career of trying to unify the two worlds (increasingly un­ der the pseu donym Voisin, \"neighbor\" ), Urbain issued a ringin g, revo­ lutionary defense of the native culture against forced Europeanization in his work of I86o, Algeria for the Algeria ns.9 2 This title was the prototype for innumerable anticolonial appeals of later eras. But for Ur­ bain it was personally inspired by the lingering fatal illness of his Mauresque wife, which for him symbolized the suffering of the Arab peoples. Napoleon III was impressed by this and other of Urbain's works . He came to know Urbain as his official interpreter while tour­ ing Algie rs, and gave the aging Arabophile the impression of adopting his ideas by declaring in 1862 : How can one count upon the pac ification of a country when almost the entire population is incessantly distur bed. . . .

The tragedy is not only that N a­ poleon III did not honor the implied promise of national self-determi­ nation, but also that men like Urbain believed that he would do so.94 It was the last in a long line of Na poleonic illusions which began with Saint-Simon's own propo sals to the first Bonapa rte and ended with the docile service of surviving Saint-Simonians as bankers and railroad builders for Na poleon III. Even after Na poleon's fall in 1870, Urbain continued to believe that some kind of reconciliation between East and West was in fact taking place within French North Afric a. When another black came from the West Indies a century after Ur­ bain to adopt the Algerian cause as his own, he preached not the reconciling philosophy of Urbain and the early Saint-Simo nians, but heroic , therapeutic violence. The time seemed to have come for the \"na ­ tions of the world\" to \"account for the riches\" taken from the poorer na tions as Urbain had predic ted. But Frantz Fanon's accounting was not to be made in Urbain's warm confidence that both \"the Orient and the Occident belong to God\" ; but rather in the cold belief that a diabo­ listic Occident must be defeated by a mass ive uprising of les damnes de la terre . Yet these words from Fanon's most famous title came not from a native song, but from the French revolutionary poet, Eugene de Potter, whose hymn to the fallen commun ards of Paris became the Intern {}}­ tionale. It was not just from native traditions or from visionary proph­ ets like Urbain that the \"wretched of the earth\" were to take their ideas of liberation in the twentieth century. It was also from a new genera­ tion of European political revolution aries tutored less in the romantic Saint-Simonianism of Urbain, than in the grim political prison of Devil's Island on the tropical island Urbain had left behind. The Hegelians The \"Young\" or \"Left\" Hegelians transformed the vague historicism of Saint-Simonians and others into hard revolutionary conviction. Their in­ fluence (like that of the Saint-Simon ians ) began only after the death of the master. About a decade after the appearance of a Saint-Simonian moveme nt, left Hegelianism appeared in the late 183os as the genera­ tional badge of younger radicals east of the Rhi ne. Alexander Herzen, a founder of the Russian revolutionary tradition, was typical in mov­ ing from an early infatuation with Saint-Simon, whose works he had \"carried around like a Koran ,\" to Hegel, in whom he found \"the algebra of revolution.\" 95 The met aphors were well chosen.

Some older Saint­ Simonians turned to the study of Hegel; 96 and young Slavs like Herzen were exhil arated by the more radical Young Hegelia ns. Herzen wrote from exile in Vladimir in July 1839 that he was contemplating a dis­ sertation on \"How is our century a link between the past and the future ?\" when he came upon the radical treatise of a Polish Hegelian who answered his ques tion with a \"philosophy of action .\" 97 Nothing better illustrates the transnational appeal of revolution ary Hegelianism . A Russian exile east of Moscow was rejoicing over the work of a Polish thinker writing in German on the basis of a French translation of the works of the dead Hegel. Revolutionary Hegelianism was , however, no less extreme for being derivative. Herzen wrote that Saint-Simon's sentimental \"New Christianity\" was henceforth forever su­ perseded \"by the absolute knowledge revealed by Hegel.\" The future society is to be the work not of the heart, but of the concrete. Hegel is the new Christ bringing the word of truth to men .. . 98 The conversion to Saint-Simonianism of young Germans like Gall and Gans in the Paris of the early thirties preceded, and in a way prepared for, Karl Marx's educat ion in Hegelian ism. For Gans was Marx's high­ school teacher at Trier; and either he or Marx's future father-in-law may have exposed Marx to the ideas of Saint-Simon there before his infatua­ tion with Hegelian thought at Berlin Univers ity.99 The entire phenome­ non of left Hegelianism has indeed been described as \"nothing more than a Heg elianized Saint-Simonianism or a Saint-Simonianized Hegel­ ianism.\" 100 Prussian Pedagogy To understand the Young Hegelians, one must move from the adven­ turesome vistas of the Saint-Simonians to a quieter world of abstract intellectualism : from energetic engineers at the Ecole Polytechnique to brooding philosophers of the University of Berlin. If Saint-Simonian­ ism was the religion of the polytech niciens in pos t-revolutionary France, so Hegelianism was the religion of university students in post­ reform Prussia. The new university at Berlin was the intellectual heart of the Prussian revival after Prussia's humiliation by Na poleon. Hegel was central to its intellectual life not only as professor of philosophy from 1818 until his death in 1831, but for many years thereafter. Founded in 18og, the University of Berlin was in many ways the first modern university -urban, rese arch-ori ented, state-supported, free from traditional reli­ gious controls .1 0 1 Berlin stood at the apex of the entire state educa­ tional system of reform Prussia. Deliberately located in the capital rather than in the traditional sleepy provincial town, the University of Berlin breathed an atmosphere of political expectation and intelle ctua l innovation among both its uncharact eristically young professors (m ostly in their thirti es ) and its gifted students. Berlin was built on a"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"226 THE DOMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES solid German tradition that had already extended and modernized the university ideal-notably at Halle in the late seventeent h century and Gottingen in the mid-eighteenth. But both of these had been lost to the Prussian state in the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807. Thus the hopes of all Prussia were focused on the new university at Berlin, the first to be built around the library and laboratory rather than the catechistic class­ room. The university offered entering students the challenge of research rather than learning by rote, the promise of discovering new truths rather than propagating old ones. Education at Berlin was built around sharing the explorations of a professor rather than covering a pre­ scribed curriculum. Interest focused on research institut es-twelve were added during the first ten years of the university's existence­ rather than on the theological faculty, hitherto the dominant area. Even here, innovation was evident in the intra-confe ssional, state ­ appointed theological faculty dominated by the unorthodox Friedrich Schleiermacher. Berlin University marked a new chapter not only in the development of scholarship, but also in the relationship of education to society. For it was a creation of the state, pledged to train a new Prussian elite. Schleiermacher's most famous work was Patriotic Sermo ns; and the best-known work of Fichte, the first rector and professor of philosophy at the university , was Speeches to the German Nation of 1807. By the time Hegel succeeded to Fichte's chair in I8Ig, the first flush of optimism in Prussia had faded. Restrictions had been placed on students, and conservative Austria rather than reform Prussia domi­ nated the politics of the German-speaking world. But Hegel had a life­ long interest in politics evidenced by his substitution of English polit­ ical newspapers for morning prayers as a young student of theology. He described newspaper reading as \"a sort of realistic morning prayer. One orients one's attitude to the world by God or by that which the world itself is.\" 10 2 Hegel's \"world\" was largely political. Deeply affected by the aroused hopes of the French Revolution, he focused his philosophy on the goal of universal political liberation : No other philosophy has been so much and so intimately a philosophy of the Revolution .l o 3 Marxist intellectuals continue to insist on the revolutionary impact of Hegel: as the first major thinker to dwell on both the Industrial and the French Revolutio ns,10 4 as a key influence on Lenin as well as on Marx.1°5 Hegel was particularly impressed with Napoleon, the subconscious model for his ideal of a \"world- historical figure.\" He wrote of Napoleon in Jena in 1806: I saw Napoleon, the soul of the world, riding through the town on a reconnai ssance. It is indeed a wonderful s i gh t to see, concentrated in a point, sitting on a horse, an individual who overruns the world and mast ers it. l 0 6"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Prophecy: The Emergence of an Intelligentsia 22 7 Here was the ultimate simpli fica tion, a point parfait for the imperial intellec t. Hegel's complex thought was brought into focus by power \"concentrated in a point,\" which made new beginnings possible. When political reaction followed Na poleonic innovations and Prussia n reform , Hegel sought to convert philosophy into a political we apon . He suc­ ceeded in politicizing philosophy ; his lectures satisfied the striving toward power and \"relevance\" that was inherent in the University of Berlin -and in much of modern intellectual life. Hegel expre ssed, first of all, the supreme self-confidence of the think­ ing man in the value of his thought. Everything became relative to historical context because his own capacity for seeing the whole pic­ ture was assumed to be absolute. l0 7 Accepting the romantic belief that truth was revealed in the pecul iarities of history rather than in a sta tic natural order, Hegel nevertheless simultaneously pressed the Enlight­ enment idea that all was rational. His method applied reason to pre­ cisely those phenomena that most interested the romantic mind : art, philosophy, and religion. He had begun as a student of theology, in search of a theodicy, a just ification of the wa ys of God to ma n; he ended up instead creating a new God : the \"World Spir it.\" Just as Hegel saw his chair of philos­ ophy giving overall coherence to the intellectual variety of the new university, so the World Spirit provided a unifying rationale to the historical proc ess. Just as Berlin University was the dynamo for re­ generating German society, so Hegel's philosophy was its source of dynamism. Hegel found in the ancient Greeks' insistence on man as a social ani­ mal an antidote for lonely romantic brooding. Eternal contemplat ion of the self was , he discovered , the old idea of hell : the literal meaning of hypochond ria. The world of the spirit (or mind, the German Geist meaning both ) provided a way out, because the mind finds satisfaction in its own activity. Cha rting the life of the spirit -the \"phenomenology of mind\" as he called it- appeared as a kind of compens ation for de­ feat in battle. Hegel's \"science of consciousness\" was seen as the con­ trolling force of the univer se . His subseq uent work suggested that the individual's plight in overcoming \"alienation\" was related to that of history itself, which altemates between sep aration and reconciliation. Thesis generated antithesis and was resolved in a higher synthesis fol­ lowing the pattem of thought itself. Like history thought moved up­ ward through such tensions toward the pure life of the spirit-the old Greek ideal of contemplating contemplation. Young intellectuals in nineteenth-century Europe were fascinated by the sugges tion that their own intellectual life and personal alienation put them in special communion with the World Spirit. Reconciling reason and revelation presented no conflict for the self-proclaimed Thomas Aquinas of Protestantism. Hegel viewed all religious creeds his­ torically, as the rat ional expression of what was implicit in religious feeling at a given moment. One believed in a particular formulation primarily because one believed in the wisdom of the process of which it was a part. Just as political organizations were necessa ry to give"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"228 THE DoMI NANCE OF THE NATIONAL REvOLUTIONARIEs objective expression to the need for sociability, so churches were needed to objectify the subject ive feelings of awe that all men felt. Ultimate truth lay only in the process itself-moving through, yet beyond, all partial, historical forms of expression. History was a process whereby the absolute mind moves to absolute freedom. The only real freedom for any individual man lay in knowing its inner laws and ever-changing necessities. Thus, Hegel gave a compelling urgency to knowledge about how his­ tory worked. All truth was realized in history, and any part of reality was intelligible only in historical context. Hegel's fragmentary attempts to decode the historical process inspired a bewildering variety of move­ ments. His argument that certain great men were chosen agents (\"world historical figures\") stimulated Carlyle and other theorists of \"great men\" in history. His belief in a special role for the German world and the Prussian state inspired the chauvinistic \"neo-Hegelians\" of the late nine­ teenth century. His own political predisposition for evolution ary con­ stitutionalism influenced the so-called Rechtsstaat or \"rule of law\" liberals. His belief that the mission of the mind was to seek a compre­ hensive understanding of human phenomena inspired much of the apolitical, \"Germanic\" scholarship in the humanities and social sciences throughout the nineteenth century. But the most important aspect of Hegel's immense influence was that which he exercised on the so-called Young or Left Hegelia ns. This new generation of radicals drew from his legacy a belief in the dialec­ tical inevitability and revolutionary direction of history. Of course, like the other Hegelian isms, revolutionary Hegelianism was based only on a partial reading of Hegel's world picture. Hegel no more than Saint-Simon intended to start a new revolut ion; he meant only to resolve the co nflicts of the old. But the sedenta ry Berlin professor with his snuff box and haute bourgeois style of life hatched the most rev­ olutionary idea of all: the dialectical method. By suggesting that history like thought proceeds progressively through contradiction and conflict, Hegel justified a new type of militance based on what might be called the power of negative thinkin g. Originally, of course, the dialectic was for Hegel a positive, reconciling concept. The general direction was onward and upward. Each new synthesis tended to lift up ( aufheben ) the level of civilization. But, since history pro­ gressed through contradiction, Hegel's method suggested that each new affirmation necessa rily gave rise to negation. This tension, in turn, gave birth to the \"negation of ne gation,\" a new synthesis. Since the essential content of history was thought, the key elements in its dynamic development were ideas. To understand which were the critical ones in a given era required a new type of speculative thinking that transcended the one-sidedness of either unhistorical reasoning (which he called raisonne ment ) or unreasoning imagination (which he called Vorstellung or \"representation,\" the favorite word of his rival Schopenhau er). Rather one had to seek through reflection on realit y to gain a \"grasp\" or \"concept\" (Begriff ) of the unfolding truth of history. By gaining this grasp of the Zeitgeist (\"spirit of the time\") the specu-"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"�---- -- - -------- - -------- - - -- -- -- ----- ---�-- -- Pl'op hecy: The EmeTgence of an Intelligentsia 22 9 lative intellectual acquired a sense of relevance which he otherwise tended to lack in a frenetic world. Hegel saw history taking man from the realm of necessity to that of freedom through the progressive development of Western civilization -from the advent of monotheism when freedom was posited for the one (God ) through the Reformation when it was proposed for all by Luther. Hegel felt that, in the present age, the idea of freedom was at last taking political form through the new type of state that had been proposed by Frederick the Great and partly realized in the Prussian refo rms. In a sense, then, the Hegelian vision was simply a sublime justific ation for Hegel's own voc ation as a kind of pedag og-in-chief for reform Prussia. Hist ory was transforming abstract ideas into concrete form, and Prussia was the cutting edge. Who could be more important to history than the key figure in the key institution of the key state ? The sense of destiny and self-impo rtance that Hegel imparted to the study of philosophy at Berlin lingered on after his death. But to a new generation of students who flocked to the Prussian capital from central and eastern Europe it was difficult to sustain Hegel's optimism about the state as the chosen instrument of the historical process. After Tsar Nicholas I of Russia crushed the Polish rebellion in 1831 and pro­ nounced his absolutist doct rine of \"Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Na tion­ ality\" in 1833, he leaned increasingly for support on his conservative relatives in the ruling house of Prussia. When a new king of Prussia, Frederick .William IV, dis appointed the hopes that attended his coro­ nation in 1840 and proved even more reac tion ary than his predecessor, a new group of Young Hegelians began to give a revolutionary reading to their ma ster's message. It had been a decade since Hegel died; and the new generation had never known the exhil aration of hopeful participation in active reform. They had, however, imbibed the visionary hopes of the Hegelian per­ spective and the exuber ant, arrogant intellectualism of Berlin . Each of the two major strands from which Bolshevism was eventu ally woven -the Russian revolution ary intelligentsia and German Ma rxism -had its origins in the Young Hegelian movement. The pioneers in both camps were intellectuals of the 184os-men who were seeking not so much to redress concrete wrongs as to realize an abstract ideal : the Hegelian transition \"from necessity to freedom.\" Before turning to the German Marxist, and the Russian revolutionari es, one must trace the first Slavic awakening which took place under the spell of Hegel and the leadership of the Poles. Slavic Awakening A new generation of Poles, humiliated by the disappearance of their nation, found a certain attraction in the new German intell ectual at­ mosphere. Writin g largely in the relative freedom of Prussian-occupied Poznan, these Poles tumed Hegelianism into a wea pon of revolution and invented a new verbal talisman for the Sla vs : intelligentsia. The founder of revolution ary Hegelianism, August Cieszkowski, came"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"2 3 0 THE DOMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES to Berlin in I832 just after Hegel's death. During a trip to Paris in I836-38, he fell under Saint-Simonian and Fourierist influence and pub­ lished upon his return to Berlin in I838 his seminal Prolegomena to a Historiosophy. Despite his pretentious title and awkward German prose, Cieszkowski brought a simple message that radicalized the master in the guise of providing a final \"knowledge of history\" (the literal mean­ ing of historiosophy ). History, he contended, moved dialectically through three successive ages: emotion, thought, and action. The first age was that of antiquity, the second stretched from the birth of Christ to the death of Hegel, and the third was the present age which was destined to translate philoso­ phy into action. Cieszkowski introduced the Greek term praxis for the \"practical ac­ tivity\" that he felt would be characteristic of the new age. The quest for a \"philosophy of action\" became central to the most revolutiona ry thinkers of the group : first radical fellow Poles, 108 then the seminal Russian revolutionary Nicholas Ogarev in I 84 I , 109 and finally Karl Marx. In his Philosophical Manus cripts of 1844 Marx sought to harness thought to action: both by plunging directly into revolutionary activity and by discarding specul ative thought for \"the study of social praxis.\" 110 This activist study of society in its concrete historical con­ text was little more than a German adoption of the \"social physiolo gy\" of the Saint-Simoni ans; but it was also a means of overcoming one's sense of separation from other men by discovering a new world in which \"total man and total society tend to recover one another.\" 111 Thus, however much the Young Hegelians may have been providing answers to the real needs of society, they were also answering their own psychological need for a purpose in life: some way of reconciling themselves to living with their fellow man, and even with themselve s. The more lonely and intense the intellectual, the more universal his ideal tended to become. Thus the Poles who had lost their national identity in 1831 and imbibed Hegelianism from nearby Prussia produced a small but highly creative group of ideologists who rejected the dom­ inant ethos of Polish nationalism for the more universal vision of social revolution . A Polish Saint-Simoni an, Bogdan Janski, had been the first to use the term \"social revolution\" in the I83os, 11 2 before going on to found a conservat ive new religious \"order of the Resurrecti on.\" Cieszkowski, too, moved from ideology to cosmology in order to sustain an image of worldwide social transformation. To counter Mickiewicz's idea of nation-as-messiah, he suggested that the Lord's Prayer contained a prophecy of a coming social utopia. In his enormo us, unfinished work of the I84os, Our Father, he argued that the Kingdom was literally about to come \"on earth as it is in heaven.\" A reintegrated \"organic humanity\" was to usher in a new age of \"the Holy Spirit\" in which all national identities would disappear before the Central Government of Mankind, the Universal International Tribunal, and the Universal Coun­ cil of the Peoples, 1 13"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Prophecy: The Emergence of an Intelligentsia 2 3 1 In 1843, B.

In his neglected work, The Relation­ ship of Philosophy to Cybernetics; or the art of ruling nations, he also invented the word \"intellig entsia.\" In a passage challenging the leader­ ship of the nationalist poet Adam Mickiewicz, Trentowski called him out of touch with \"the new generation and the new spirit ,\" ... trembling from fear lest the sceptre with which he rules the Polish in­ telligentsia be taken from him. 114 Trentowski had been educated in Germany; and he published his treatise in Poznan, where the Prussian cens orship was somewhat more liberal than in the Austrian- or Russia n-occ upied parts of Poland. The following year, in the same city, the term \"progre ssive intelligentsia\" was introduced in a periodical edited by Karol Libelt, a Polish Hegelian who had been educated in Berlin and politicized in Paris. 1 1 5 In his Love of the Fatherland written in the same 1844, Libelt des cribed this intelli­ gentsia as ... all those who having carefully and broadly obtained an educat ion in higher schools and institutes, stand at the head of the nation as scholars, officials, teachers, clergymen, industrialists-in sum all those who lead it because of their higher enlightenment. l 16 Here, clearly, was an alternate leadership for Poland to the military rule of the occu pying powers . The idea blended in with the new theory simultaneously put forward by Cieszkowski that the hereditary aristoc­ racy should be replaced by a new aristocracy of merit .117 Subsequent usages of the term by the Polish press in Poznan introduced the idea that the \"intellig entsia\" was separate from the masses. l l8 Libelt and Cieszkowski still looked largely to the old aristocracy to produce the new elite. But Libelt's call upon the youth of Poland to \"sacrifice your reality to an ideal,\" to \"fall in love with enlightenment while renouncing the pleasures of the body\" was a harking forward to the future. In Russia of the 186os, intelligentsia first acq uired its full­ blown modern sugge stion of an intellectual elite cut off from traditional allegiances and dedicated to radical social change.UB Libelt invoked the text of Schiller's poem \"Resignation,\" a poem that had become simul­ taneously \"especially popular in Russia,\" 12 o suggesting the needed spirit of sacrifi ce to the founders of its revolutionary intellige ntsia, Herzen and Oga rev. The poem offered the choice between satisfaction in the present and hope for the future. There was no question that Slavic revolutionaries had chosen, already in the fort ies, to live by hope. Hegelian philosophy gave them hope-even when they rejected it. Belinsky, the founder of Russian radical journalism, wrote in 1838 that Hegel's teachings enabled him \"to get along with practical peo­ ple\" 1 2 1 by convincing him that they were objectively worthy of study. Th e He g elian pe rs p ec tiv e elevated him beyond what his correspondent Bakunin called \"my personal me.\" 1 22 Belinsky subsequently rejected the \"reconciliation with reality\" that Hegel had provided, proclaiming that"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"2 3 2 THE DOMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES ... the fate of the subj ect, the individual, the personality is more important than the fate of the whole world and ... the Hegelian All gemeinheit. 12 3 But this was \"the cry of revolt of a sick man whom the Hegelian medi­ cine has not cured.\" 1 24 Indeed, the \"medicine\" had induced an addic­ tion for an all-encompassing ideology; and the young n?voltes of Berlin were producing one in their \"philosophy of action.\" 125 Ogarev, studying in Germany, pointed the way with his declaration that \"not all that is real is rational, but all that is rational should become real. The philosophy of action is at present the best trend . . . a theory according to which irrational reality changes into a rational one. Praxis is history.\" Revolutiona ry action is the cure for alienation , the appropriate response to the present age, and a means of transform­ ing Hegelian abstractions into \"something personal.\" 126 Ogarev's friends, the \"romantic exiles\" Herzen and Bakunin, made particularly anguished efforts to blend the personal into the universal and to answer Cieszkowski's call for a new philosophy of action.1 2 7 The Russians felt the double disability of being provincial aristocrats as well as alienated intellec tuals. They suffered an acute sense of being like the \"superfluous men\" of Russian literature, with even less opportunity than Prussians for meaningful activity in society. But, in a Prussia more interested in economic growth ( through the Zollverein, the new customs union of I 834) than in political or educational development, many Germans also felt frustrated. Neglected young intellectuals tended to reaffirm their own worth by exaggerating the worthlessness of the ruling forces. None of the leading Young Hegelians had seriously suffered at the hands of the European authoritie s; and most of them (including Marx) appear never to have even been inside a factory. Theirs was a mental and spiritual revolt-born of new vision rather than old grievances. They spoke from exile-Russians in Berlin or Paris, Prussians in Ge­ neva or Brussels, Poles everywhere . They spoke with many tongues­ but always in the language of prophecy. Just as Christian prophets had identified oppressive rulers with the Antichrist in order to heighten ex­ pectations of deliverance by the True Christ, so the Young Hegelian prophets now proclaimed the evil of rulers in order to intensify the thirst for revolution. That thirst was stimulated by the order of Frederick William IV of Prussia to \"root out the dragon seed of Hegelianism\" 12 8 in Berlin by awarding Hegel's former chair in philosophy to his rival: the ro­ mantic idealist Frederick Schellin g. For the radical pilgrims to Hegel's shrine, installing Schelling in Berlin was not unlike enthroning the Antichrist in Jerusalem. His inaugural lecture on \"The Philosophy of Revelat ion\" in November 1841 attracted a glittering audience, 129 in­ cluding Engels and Bakunin, both of whom excoriated this seeming re­ treat from Hegelian logic to romantic fancy.

Bakunin proclaimed late in 1842 that \"the joy of dest ruction is a creat ive joy\" ; 131 and his friend Proudhon, then under Hegel's influe nce, began his major work of the mid -18 4os with the motto : Destruam ut aedifi cabo : \"I destroy in order to build. \" 1 32 But all radical Hegelia ns-not excepting that bitter foe of Bakunin and Proudhon, Karl Marx-bel ieved that the revolution was to bring free­ dom through the destruction of the state, rather than through its ful­ fillment, as Heg el had envis aged. This second generation of Hegelians saw the end of all repressive rule coming. Some like Bakunin argued for a social revolution to overthrow \"God and the state.\" 1 33 Others like Max Stirner argued for \"the ego and its own\" 134 to reject all externally imposed authority. Marx argued that social revolution would emerge dia­ lectically from a feudal through a bourgeois to a proletarian order. But Bakunin's anarchism, Stirner's solip sism, and Marx's communism were all sus tained by the Young Hegelian conviction that an end to all authority was at hand ; and that the \"spirit of the times\" req uired a revolutionary reject ion of the present power structure. Revolutionary Hegelianism reached a kind of climax in the life of Edward Dembow ski , the aristocratic journalist who was shot at age twenty-three after leading perhaps the most extreme revolution ary re­ gime to appear in nineteenth-century Europe. Dembowski had been a leading agitator in Poznan and the quintesse ntial example of the phe­ nomenon Libelt had been the first to name : the progressive intelligent­ sia. As a youth of twenty he was struck by the doctrine of creative dest ruction set forth in Bakunin's article of 1842. The following year, Dembowski published in Libelt's journal the first of several articles in which abstract philosophy was used to justify concrete revolution ary activity. His \"Few Thoughts on Eclecticism\" argued against using Hegelianism to reconcile cont radiction s. Such an \"eclectic\" perspect ive merely played into the hands of the est ablished rulers. Atheism was esse ntial since \"the Left Hegelian school\" was at \"the absolute pole from religious radical ism.\" Only pure neg ation and des truction could lead to concrete, creat ive action that would affect the \"sensual sub­ stance\" of real life . 1 35 His last ma jor artic le, \"Thoughts on the Future of Philosophy\" in 1845, argued for a Polish nat ional philosophy of revolution to synthe­ size German thought and French deeds . 1 3 6 He traced the history of parallel sets of German thinkers and French acto rs : Kant-Robespierre, Fichte-Babeuf, Schelling-Saint-Simon, Hegel-Fourier, and Feue rbach­ Proudhon. The last pair exhausted the poss ibilities of philosophy and social criticism respec tively by attaining atheistic ma terialism on the one hand and a total reject ion of political authority on the otherJ37 Nothing remained to be done except to translate these ideas into a creative , necess arily bloody revolution on the unspoiled soil of Poland.

The ancient capital had acquired new importance as the only unoccupied part of Poland and a small region where peasants had been emancipated in the Slavic East. On Washington's birthday of 1846 a national government of Poland was proclaimed there, and two days later Dembowski became de facto leader of the \"Republic of Cracow .\" Its brief ten days of existence shook Europe with a bold proclamation of universal suffrage, national workshops, and the abolition of the system of landlord ownership so that \"everybody could make use of land property according to his mer­ its and abilities.\" 1 3 8 Seizing the difficult task of quieting and satisfying the still unruly peasantry, Dembowski set forth from the city to meet the advancing Austrian troops-hoping that they might stay out of the city and neutralize the advancing Russians. But Dembowski was shot by the Austrians, who annexed the last vestige of free Poland after the Russians occupied Cracow on March 3· The despairing Poles began to tum from soaring philosophy to grim practicalities. Dembows ki's elder cousin, Henryk Kamienski pointed the way with two major works published 1843-45: The Philosophy of the Material Economy of Human Society and On the Living Truths of the Polish People.139 The first discussed the earthy mechanics of socio­ economic change; the second, the tactical uses of revolution ary vio­ lence. The latter work called for agrarian revolution via a guerrilla uprising and a careful campaign of revolution ary terrorism. In the ex­ ploration of this subject-as in so much else-Poland of the 184os anti­ cipated Russia of the 186os. In between came the uprisings in the West: the \"revolution of the intellectuals\" in 1848, in which neither occupied Poland nor somnolent Russia played any major part. The Clash of \"Isms\" in 18 48 Early in 1848, a wave of revolutions struck Europe. It reached further and lasted longer than that of 1830. But it failed everywh ere-and brought to an end that \"exciting sense of almost limitless possibili­ ties\" Ho that had previously prevailed among revolutionar ies. After 1848, calculation generally replaced exaltation; the prosaic reality of state-building and industrial development supplanted the romantic vi­ sion of a new nation or social community. Henceforth, revolutions were basical ly caused by defeat in foreign wars rather than by internal social upheaval. Taken as a whole, the revolutions of 1848 seem more fluid than solid: more a flooding of foundations everywhere than a hard seizure of power or definition of program anywhere .

Artisans threatened by social change and other uprooted ele­ ments in the great cities of continental Europe provided the combus­ tible material. Traditional structures were weakened by economic de­ pression below and political ineptness above. The resulting swirl of political experiment and poetic enthusiasm has perhaps been best char­ acterized as \"the revolution of the intellectuals .\" 1 4 1 This revolution may have a relevance for the ideologically insecure Western world of the late twentieth century which it did not have for the more confident Europe of the late nineteenth century. As the last great upheaval of an essentia lly pre-industrial Europe, 1848 drew on many of the same basic elements as the first internal upheaval of the essentia lly post-industrial West in the late rg6os. Both movements be­ came almost instantly transnati onal-and cut deepest into society when they succeeded in arousing newly arrived and unassimilated elements within the cities. The Irish in London, the Saxons in Berlin, and the provincials in Paris 142 played roles in the agitation of the late r84os not altogether unlike that of the blacks in American cities in the late rg6os. Of course, the revolutions of 1848 were far more extensive than the student-led riots of rg68-and the bonds between intellectual and ur­ ban upheaval far stronger . The two waves of unrest also had profoundly different causes. But both had the effect of encouraging conservat ive trends in the years that followe d. The two upheavals shared, moreover, a profound difference from almost all the more ritualized and organized forms of upheaval that appeared during the intervening 120 years of industrial organization and geopolitical conflict among mechanized states. Indeed, 1848 and rg68 form a kind of frame for the geopolitical conflict of the industrial age. For all their differences, the unrest of 1848 and rg68 each began by bringing down the dominant symbol of political power in the Western World: the last king of France and an \"imperial\" president of the United States. In each case internal unrest bore an intimate historic link to a remote foreign war. The unrest of the r 84os did not really end until the aroused popular passions of the greatest industrial states of the nineteenth century, Great Britain and France, were channeled off into the first major armed conflicts of the industrial era: the Crimean War of r853-56. The unrest of the rg6os did not really begin until popular sentiment in the greatest industrial state of the twentieth century, the United States, rose against the war in Vietnam. There is a similarity between these two wars-as between the revolu­ tions to which Crimea and Vietnam are related. These two destructive wars mark the birth and perhaps the death of the ritual of mass vio­ lence organized at home but exercised abroad by liberal industrial states. Both wars were strictly localized in distant places through a grad­ ual process of escalation. The doses were calculated by antiseptic ac­ countants and sugar-coated by ambitious politicians who dramat ized the threat of a hostile authoritarian regime taking over- through the domino effect-an unstable area (Russia in the Balkans, China in Southeast Asia). Both wars were entered into by idealistic, innovative"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"2 3 6 THE DOMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES reformers (Palmerston and Kennedy/Johnson ) and were briefly glam­ orized by creating heroic fighting models (the Light Brigade, the Green Berets). Success or failure depended in each case on the relevance of new technology and the role of new means of communication. In the Crimea, the London Times and the new mass press stimulated the enthusiasm for war and the thirst for victory. In Vietnam, the New York Times and the new mass medium, television, helped take Americ a out of the war. The modern ritual of national warfare through applied industrial power came into being to a considerable extent to channel if not resolve the largely formless but exalted aspirations of the I 848-50 period in industrial England and industrializing France. The ritual may well have exhausted itself in Vietnam in the Ig6os, when some of these same aspirations reappeared in post-industrial America in a second, even more formless \"revolution of the intellectuals.\" The ferment of Ig68 may have revived at the twilight of the industrial era some of the forms and ideas present at the dawn in I848. A central role in this original revolution of the intellectuals in I8 48 was played by new ideas (the \"isms\") and new means of communication (m ass journalism ). Out of the three basic ideals of the French Revolu­ tion-la n§publique, la nation, la communaute-came the three new systems of ideas that vied for men's allegiance in continental Europe during the early nineteenth century: liberalism, nationalism, and so­ cialism. After the reincarnation of revolution in France in I83o, these isms were linked with renewed hopes for revolution ary fulfillment on the part of political, national, and social revolution aries alike. The revolutions that spread from France in Europe in I848 can be discussed in terms of the interaction and conflict of these three isms. We have seen how the cafes of the Palais-Royal provided in I788-8g the legitimation of a royal patron for free political discussion with a broad public, and mobilized that public for revolution ary action. In like manner, the national banquet campaign for electoral reform of I 84 7-48 provided the legitimation of a parliament ary activity for an even greater extension of political discussion that led to a new revolu­ tion .143 But, whereas the Paris mob on July I2, I789, had assembled in one point (the Palais-Royal ), were aroused by one grievance (the dis­ missal of Necker), and finally converged on one target (the Bastille), the new mob of February 22, I848, assembled diffusely on the streets in support of a banquet campaign that had covered all of France; their grievances were economic ; and their processions protested the cancel­ lation of the climactic great banquet in Paris. The crowd that coursed through Paris for two days until King Louis Philippe abdicated lacked the cohesion of the earlier mob that had set out from his father's ele­ gant enclave of cafes sixty years earlier. The Parisians of I848 were seeking food not drink, an ideological not a geographical locus of legitimacy. The basic conflict between moderate political and radical social aspi­ rations was apparent from the beginnin g. Though superficially a classi-"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Prophecy: The Emergence of an Intelligentsia 2 37 cal political revolution like that of 1830, the scenes on the barricaded streets were dramatically different. The people were hungrier, the weather colder. The romantic tenor Nourrit had held center stage in celebrating the \"three glorious days\" of July 1830. But, in the freezing February of 1848, the revolution found its artistic hero and spokesma n in a vaudev ille actor, Frederick Lemaitre, playing in a social drama of the street: The Ragpicker. Lemaitre also played in traditional revolution ary melodramas, such as Toussaint L'Ouverture written by the poet who became foreign min­ ister of the new provisional government in 1848, Lamartine. But Lemai­ tre increasingly turned to vaudeville, which had been dramatically linked with revolution ever since the manager of the Vaudeville Theater, Etienne Arago, had shut his theater and bid the audience join the in­ surgent mob in 1830, proclaiming \"there shall be no laughter at the Vaudeville while Paris is in tears!\" 144 In preparing for the role, Lemaitre studied directly with a famous Parisian ragpicker who was viewed as a social critic, 1 45 Lemaitre played the role daily-cont rary to Paris cus­ tom-after its opening in 1847; 1 4 6 and The Ragpicker proved in 1848 a piece d'occasion for revolution as had Hernani and The Mute Girl of Portici in 1830. A free perform ance of the play given on noon of February 24 for the people of Paris produced such an \"indescribable effect\" that \"contem­ poraries are unanimous in attributing to the play an influence on the February Revoluti on.\" 1 47 In the play, Lemaitre had to pick a crown out of a wastebasket, and when he did so the audience burst into singing La Marseillaise in communal celebration of the transfer of power from the last French monarch to the people. Cannon sounded, the audience cried Vive la n§publique !, and the performance blended into a popular demonstra tion which Lemait re called \"a truly sublime spectacle.\" The author of the play, newly returned from banishme nt, wrote that \"a life of exile is a small price to pay for a day like that.\" 14 8 By June, the provisional revolutionary government would be firing on many of those who had felt the sublimity of which Lemaitre spoke. The working people of Paris had begun to echo the ragpicker's complaints about having to \"find his bread in the manure pile,\" 14 9 and had en­ rolled 30,ooo subscribers for a proposed banquet of the people (costing only 25 centimes rather than the 10 francs of bourgeois electoral ban­ quets) . 1 50 But this popular feast was cancelled, and the bloody \"June days\" soon followed, pitting liberalism against socialism in the streets of Paris. In the meantime, however, revolution had spread throughout Europe largely under the banner of the third and most appealing ism of the age: nationalism. Nationalism was, as we have seen, the dominant revolution ary ideol­ ogy between 1830 and 1848. On the eve of 1848, with the campaign of the Cyril and Methodius Society in the Ukraine and of nationalists under Kossuth in the Hungarian Diet, youthful representatives of the largest sub-nationalities in each of the great multi-national empires, Austria and Russia, led the way.

When the bourgeois monarchy of Louis Philippe collapsed in Paris late in February, French approval seemed assured for national revol t elsewhere. A French chansonnier who had previously seen the French banquet campaign as the beginning of a new \"universal feast\" of all nations,1\"I now rhapsodized that Paris est sorti du tombeau ... Radieux comme un Christ nouveau .15 2 Even before the new French government had acquired political form, it justified itself \"by natural right and by national right,\" appealing to the nations rather than the sovereigns of Eu rope.153 As if in respons e, a flash flood of national revolutions swept from Copenhagen and Amsterdam to Venice and Sardinia. Germany was the whirlpool at the center in its \"March days.\" Metternich, symbol par excellence of antinationalism, resigned and fled. Within a week, Berlin followed Vienna in revolt; the king of Prussia adopted the tricolor of revolutiona ry Germany; and all authority seemed on the verge of col­ lapse. In this atmosphere, nationalist revolutionaries turned to the con­ stitutional political forms that had provided the banners for revolt at the beginning of the Metternichean era. Thus, the German-speaking world brought to center stage the second revolutionary doctrine of the romantic era: liberalism. Liberalism dominated European thinking from the assembling late in March of a committee of fifty German leaders in a \"pre-parliament\" calling for the election of a constituent assembly for a united Germany. In April, a constituent assembly was elected in France in the first n a ­ tionwide voting by universal male suffrage, and when the provisional government resigned its authority in May, a moderate republican assembly in effect became the government of France. Republics and constitutions were proclaimed in a variety of Italian regions; and a Slavic congress assembled in Prague in imitation of the German as­ sembly that met in Frankfurt on May I8. The 83o-man Frankfurt assembly provided the most sustained and se­ rious effort to realize a new constitutional order on the continent. It sought to extend the French idea of a Declaration of the Rights of Man into a broader Declara tion of the Rights of People. But in seeking to represent \"the people\" directly, the educated parliamentarians of Frankfurt cut themselves off from the existing bases of real power. In a German world that was still politically divided and economically backward, local and princely authorities gradually reclaimed real power from above. Meanwhile, from below, the specter of social revolution in the summer of I 848 increasingly frightened the middle-class liberals of Frankfurt.

Proletarian unrest following the depression of 1847 had helped pre­ cipitate the original February Revoluti on. The Commission for the Workers, which the provisional government set up in the Luxembourg Palace, soon became the driving force in a gathering social revolution. This Luxembourg Commission of three hundred to four hundred work­ ers provided the forum for workin g-class demands, some of which (promulgation of the right to work and creation of national workshop s) the assembly formally approve d. Foreign apostles of socialist solutions- Robert Owen, Goodwyn Barmby, and Karl Marx-rushed to Paris. \"The King of Trade has been conquered by the Man of Work,\" 1 5 4 Barmby proclaimed in March, prais­ ing the socialist president of the commission, Louis Blanc, and its vice­ president, \"Albert the Artisan.\" 1 55 On April 22, he wrote to England that \"by the time this reaches you Paris will have peacefully socialized its banks, railroads and factories .\" 15 6 By the time that message reached England, however, the conserva­ tive swing against proletarian Paris had begun. The Left was badly de­ feated in the elections to the assembly late in April; well-known revolu­ tionary leaders like Blanqui were arrested in May; and in June some ten thousand workers were killed or wounded and about eleven thou­ sand deported by the forces of the \"liberal\" assembly. The \"June days\" emboldened forces of reaction throughout Europe. Four days after repression in Paris, the Frankfurt assembly turned to the conservative Austrian archduke as \"regent of Germa ny.\" Shortly thereafter, the assembly called on Prussian troops to rescue it from revolutionary siege of the Frankfurt church in which it met. With the crushing of a revolt in Baden in September and of a proletarian uprising in Berlin in October, the assembly prepared the way for the full-scale return to monarchical conservatism in the German-speaking world, which began with the counter-revolution in the spring of 1849 in Vienna, where the German revolution had started just a year before. The counter-revolutionary resurgence throughout Europe in 1849-50 benefited not just from the inexperience of intellectuals as political leaders. Equally important were the underlying conflicts that came to the surface between the differing revolutionary ideologies themselve s. Liberalism in Germany had been the main source of revolutionary hope outside France; Marx himself had urged the abolition of a distinct Communist League in the spring of 1848 in order to unify all revolu­ tionary forces behind a consolidated \"bourgeois democratic\" revolution. But German liberals were unnerved by the rise of a workers' move­ ment, and the specter of communism that this movement raised helped turn older liberals into new conserv atives. Even more fundamental was the inner conflict between the once compatible, but now rival, revolu­ tionary goals of national unification and constitutional republi canism. The former proved far more appealing to the masses in times of up­ heaval. Germans could be aroused by hatred of Russia, and Italians by"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"240 THE DoMI NANCE oF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES hatred of Austria. Both Germans and Italians proved willing-at times even eager-to drop liberal republican ideals and accept a king. As long as it was a king of their own who could give them identity, they seemed ready to choose the national ideal of unity over the liberal ideal of freedom : Einheit over Freiheit. The failure of 1848 in Germany also illustrated the conflict within lib­ eralism between the desire for a strong rule of law and for increased freedom of the individual. The defeated German liberals of Frankfurt were only a little less authoritarian than the victorious German na­ tionalists. The liberals believed in a strong executive and a weak leg­ islature; 1 57 and their concept of a \"constitutional union\" helped di­ vorce the phrase \"constitutional\" from its previous associations with romantic revolutionary delivera nce. Konstitutionelle suggested the juste milieu of law and order; and this concept of a \"constitutional consti­ tution\" was in direct contrast to that of a revolutionary constitution. The former bespoke moderation, the latter had promised liberation. Constitutional liberalism ceased to be a revolution ary ideal in Germany not just because of hostile pressures exerted by conservati ves, but also because of the definitions that liberals made of their own calling. Calls for political change became less revolution ary; and calls for social revolution went largely unheard. Even within the dominant rev­ olutiona ry ism of nationalism, the upheavals of 1848-so revealed deep conflicts that were never envisaged in the Mazzinian dream of a happy fraternity of federated peoples. German power was asserted at the ex­ pense of Danish and Czech identity. Hungary, which produced the most flamboyant and successful of the purely national revolutions, was crushed from above by the rival, reaction ary nationalism of Russia and undercut from below by the secessionist nationalism of the Croatians, Serbs, Slovaks, and Romanians. Reactionary monarchs triumphed everywhere east of the Rhine; and, by rSsr, the only hope for revolution aries seemed to lie in France and England. England had preserved a measure of civil liberties and wel­ comed political refugees from the continent. France had overthrown its last king and established a republic based on universal suffrage. But England had defused the radical side of its liberal tradition by an in­ genious combination of preventive police repression and selective leg­ islative co-optat ion of the Chartist reform program. The Chartist demonstr ation in London of April r848 involved elements of the largest urban working class and the best-educated lower middle class in Europe. But the proponents of \"physical force\" had already lost out within the movement. With the failure of the rain-soaked gathering to produce anything more than an ineffectual petition for further democratic rights, England saw 1848 pass without an uprising, let alone a revolution. Liberalism was separated further from revolu­ tionary militan ce; and the great exhibition of material goods in the Crystal Palace in rSsr turned English eyes away from ideas altogether to the promise of prosperity and evolutiona ry progress.

Despite stiff resistance to the coup in the countryside , he was able to turn the Second Republic into the Second Empire and establish for a decade a kind of police state sanctioned by plebiscite which reflected a widespread desire for order and stability. 1 5 S Four days after his coup, Napoleon III returned the Pantheon to the archbishop of Paris, who renamed it (for the third time) the Church of Saint Genevi eve-thus dooming to oblivion a unique artistic effort to express the general faith underlying all the ism's. For more than three years, a dedicated team of revolution ary painters under Paul Chenavard had been working on a vast set of designs to redecorate the Pantheon. 1 59 It was perhaps the most ideologic ally ambitious artistic project of the 1848-51 era-and a worthy reprise of those first efforts after the death of Mirabeau in 1791 to turn the church into a secular shrine for great men which might inspire revolutiona ries to \"make the world into a Pantheon .\" 16 o Chenava rd's career reads like a recapitulation of revolution ary roman­ ticism. He had been a member of the claque at the opening of Hugo's Hernani on the eve of the Revolution of 1830, an iconographer of Mira­ beau and the original National Assembly in the afterm ath, the man whom Delacroix asked to see when dying, and-through out-a faithful son of Lyon both in his passion for the working man and in his Ger­ manic and mystical approach to social question s. At the end of the frieze he designed for the Pantheon to show the progress of humanity stood Saint-Simon and Fourier, whose followers were Chenava rd's closest friends in the 184os.l6 1 He was commissioned to redecorate the Pan­ theon in April 1848 by the brother of the socialist leader Louis Blanc (Charles Blanc, the revolution ary Director of Beaux-Arts ) and by the radical political leader Alexander Ledru-Rollin , the new Minister of the Interior. The central element in Chenava rd's revolution ary iconography was a vast mural in heroic classical style representing real and mythical fig­ ures in a circular panorama of progressive \"palingenesis\" (continuous rebirth) leading towards universal brotherhood among androgynous su­ permen. Right-Left interaction is evident in this uncompleted monu­ ment of revolution ary faith. The title of his great mosaic under the central dome of the Pantheon, La Palingenesie Sociale, was taken di­ rectly from a book published in 1827 by his conservative Catholic friend and fellow Lyonnais, Pierre-Simon Ballanche. Ballanche's vision of his­ tory as a series of \"social rebirths\" represented the romantic \"politics of the miraculous\" at its most fantastic. Although he was politically reactionary and ultimate ly pessimistic about progress (predicting a re­ turn of humanity to animality after its ascent to godhood ), Ballanche had inspired many of the most widely optimistic imaginations in the revolution ary camp: the Saint-Simonians in their messianic phase in 1832, and the aged Charles Nodier, who p ublished a futuris tic fantas y Palingenesie humaine in the same year. 1 6 2 The paintings, sketche s, and plans of Chenav ard and his associates"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"2 4 2 THE DoMI NANCE oF THE NATIONAL REvoLUTIONARIEs were relegated to the archives of provincial museums under the Second Empire .

But the con­ trolling ism's in France were no longer revolutionary ideologies of any kind-whether liberalism, nationalism, or socialism-but rather a new set of apolitical and anti-romantic attitudes which went under the names of realism, materialism, and positivism.

When the word first appeared publicly in 1840, it spread throughout the continent with a speed al­ together unprecedented in the history of such verbal epidemic s. Unlike earlier revolutionary labels, communism was a new word, associated from the beginning with a new concep t.l Rapid dissemination of the term throughout Europe was made possible by accelerated means of communication (mail service regularized by means of the steamboat and steam engine, and the first telegraphy ). Those who spread the word were a small group of young journalists whose sole occupation was verbal craftsmanship. Unlike the operatic voices of romantic nationalism, social revolutionaries communicated most naturally in printed prose-the social novel, the critical review, the polemic pamphlet. Out of a veritable ocean of such prose, the word communism emerged as a telegra phic label for an essentially ver­ bal vision. The idea, first popula rized in the pages of a novel (Cabet's Voyage to Icaria ), was refined and finally made manifest by Marx on the eve of revolution in 1848. The new term brought into focus both the fears of the older genera­ tion and the hopes of the new. The word communism spread before there were any communists.

The Talismanic Word With almost rhythmic regularity, each decade had produced its own new labels for rallying the revolutionary Left.

All of these terms lingered on in the revolutionary lexicon -a nd returned to recapture their original evoc ative power at later times in distant places. In the decades that followed the defeat of Na poleon , however, there came a change in the nature of the central, mythic terms favored by revolutionar ies . Altogether new words with more sweeping meanings began to replace older words which had more limited associations. These new labels were derived from French words ending in isme, and offered the vague but appealing prospect of providing new legitimacy for a European civilization no longer so sure of its churches and kin gs. The first new ism, which was invented and widely disseminated at the dawn of the century, was roma nticis m. From its appearance in 1804, the word transcended mere literary usage and implied the active commitment of the human will to a new world view .2 The proclama­ tion of an ism suggested a new idea requiring act ive adhere nts -a b­ stract beliefs in need of concrete commitment. Political content was added by the proclamat ion of the new and equa lly self-conscious ism of the next decade, liberalis m. But the terms romanticism and liberalism were not as revolution ary as the content of their adherents' manif estoes. Indeed, the jarrin g nov­ elty of the broad movements we understand by those design ations to­ day was somewhat softened for contem poraries by the fact that the accomp anying adjectives already had well-established, nonrevolutionary usages. There was no pretense that a romantic or a liberal person embodied in any basic sense some new doc trine requiring the special design ation of a neologism such as romanticist or liberal ist. The first new isms to create their own new ists were socialism and communism. These verbal talismans appeared with timetable punctu ality at the be­ ginning of the 1830s and 1840s respect ively. But, unlike the liberalism of the 182os, socia lism and communism produced self-pro cla imed so­ cialists and communis ts.

Nationalisme, a word coined in Barruel's widely read treatise of 1797, was rarely used by subsequent national revolutionar ies, and does not appear in any major European lexicon until the Larousse of 1874·3 National revolutionar ies, of course, used songs and symbols as much as words. They generally rebelled against any abstract social ideal, pro­ claimed an almost organic attachment to their own land and culture , and rejected slogans reflecting the rationalistic universalism of uprooted intellec tuals. National revolutionaries were also more reluctant than social revolutionaries to adopt terms introduced with scorn and hatred by their opponen ts. Even Mazzini initially avoided and rarely used the term national ism.4 Romantic nationalists essentially preached an emo­ tional gospel of love, drawing men of like heritage together into a new type of brotherh ood. Social revolutionar ies, in contrast, preached the rational restructuring of society. They were a small intellectual elite in search of a mass audience to rival that of the national ists. Above all, they needed visibility, which could be attained even through negative publicity. This, and a slogan that inspired outrage in the nonrevolu­ tionary, mass press, could be profoundly useful in attracting fresh at­ tention to their ideal of radical social change. The term socialist had a substantial prehistory of random usage as a term of abuse in the eighteenth century. In Italy, Rousseau was de­ nounced as a socialist in 1765,5 then as an antisocialist in 1803. 6 In France, a radical veteran of Babeuf's Conspiracy used the term socialist in 1797 as an insulting designa tion for a royalist chief of police.7 The word was apparently first used in its modern sense within Robert Owen's original circle of followe rs. Writing to Owen in November 1822, Edward Cowper urged the participation in a new utopian com­ munity of an unspecified person \"well adapted to become what my friend Jo Applegath calls a socialist.\" 8 In 1827, Owen became the first to use it in print. \"The chief question between the modern (or Mill and Mal thus) political economists and the communionists or socialists,\" he wrote in Cooperative Magazine, is whether \"capital should be owned individually or commonly.\" 9 It was just after the Revolution of 1830 that socialism came into widespread positive usage for the first time, and it rapidly became one of the \"sacramental words of the epoch.\" 1 0 The word was widely in­ voked in France during the 183os just as liberalism was falling into disrepute through identificat ion with the bourgeois monarchy.11 It spread rapidly along with related words (socialize, socializati on) and other, more ephemeral terms (societism, association ism) in 1831-33. Whether welcomed or cursed, socialism was generally seen as the nec­ essa ry counter both to individualism and to a narrow preoccupation with purely political processes. 1 2 The first large public gathering to use the term extensively was a congress of scientists and philosophers at Nantes in April 1833, where \"socialists\" were contrasted with \"political maniacs\" ( politicomane s), \"who busy themselves with ques tions of the constitution rather than turning their eye to the social question.\" 1 3 Another new ism that arose to challenge the alleged hollowness of"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"2 4 6 THE DOMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES political liberalism was radicalism. Already in the I82os French think­ ers had begun to take over the term radical from English utilit arian reformers. l 4 Their idea that change should go to the very root (radix) of society had been intensified by the raising of expect ations during the Revolution of I83o.1 5 Radical was used increasingly in the late thirties -p articul arly after republican became an illegal term. 1 6 But soon rad­ ical, like liber al, began to suggest opposition to revolution. Theophile Thore, a young revolution ary on trial in I84I, cited the case of a pro­ fessed radical who announced at a banquet in Rouen early in I 839 : We are revolutionar ies. Yes, friends of the completed revolution in order to prevent new revolutions . l7 The new word to which the youthful Thore and his generation turned to vindicate the ideal of social revolution was communis m. In March I84o, a conservative German newsp aper wrote : The Communists ha ve in view nothing less than a levelling of society­ substituting for the presently-existing order of things the absurd, immoral and imposs ible utopia of a community of goods. l B This , the earliest documented use of the term , already illustrates the repulsion mixed with fascinat ion that the new concept inspired in European officialdom. Usage spread rapidly throughout Europe. 1 9 An­ other conservative German newspaper paid tribute three years later to the \"immense power\" and polemic pas sion that the word had come to generate : When host ile papers find themselves unable to touch a liberal news­ paper, they reproach it for Communist tendencies. . . . One regards a Communist as a criminal against the property of another .2 o In the I84os, communism was more a presence in the minds of the propertied classes than an ideal-let alone a reality-for the proletar iat. Its beginnings as a movement can clear ly be traced to France in the late I 83os. The first formal usage of the term communist in Germany of I84o alludes to preex istent French reality, and Cabet claimed in I84I that communism began with discussions in French prisons after the arre sts of I834. 21 Although no written example has been found, the term almost certainly came into being during the late I83os as one of several new French words derived from the revived Babeuvist term communaute. Thus any account of the birth of communism must be­ gin with France. French Founders Communism as a new type of clas s-conscio us, revolutionary move­ ment originated in Lyon and Paris in the second half of the I83os. With the suppression of the workers' movement in Lyon after the insurrection of I834, a small number of proletarian leaders went underground in search of more extreme remedies.

It sought to susta in the hier­ archical revolutionary orga nization of the Blanquist Society of Seasons, but dramatized its proletarian preoccupations by chang ing the units \"week, month, and season\" into \"craft, shop, and factory .\" 2 4 Communism as a political ideal and verbal talisman origi nated, how­ ever, not among workers but among intell ectua ls who provided leader­ ship through smaller groups that arose within or out of these larger organizati ons. In Lyon, Joseph Benoit and two of the other original \"flowers\" formed late in I 838 a Committee of Equals to provid e an egalitarian program for proletarian activity. Basic ally forming a society for peace ful propagand a, its members flirted with revolution ary activ­ ism, particularly after the visit to Lyon in April I839 of Blanqu i's flamboyant comrade-in-ar ms, Barbe s. 2 5 Unlike almost all other revolu­ tionaries in the first half of the nineteenth century, Benoit had con­ siderable firsthand experience doing physical labor. Neverthele ss, his own Confessi ons of a Prole tarian indicated that the dominant forma­ tive influences on him were those that charact eristic ally affected bour­ geois revolution ary intellect uals : schooling in exile in Genev a, partic­ ipation in a colorful range of occult circles, infatuat ion with Rousseau, and, finally, the discovery of Buona rroti's book on Babeuf while impris­ oned in I834.2 s The decisive new ideological influence on Benoit and his restive col­ leagues in Lyon was Albert Laponneraye. His remarkable journal, L'In­ telligence, was later designat ed \"the first Communist organ in France,\" and Cabet called it at the time \"the stand ard-bearer of the ega litarian party, the communist party.\" 2 7 Laponneraye's journal was popular not only in Lyon, but also in Geneva and Lausanne among former followers of Buonarroti, who were simultaneously formin g the first movement to call itself communist in Switzerland. 2 S L'Intelligence began appearing in September I837, and acquired the aura of mart yrdom when Lapon­ neraye's principal collaborator, Richard Lahautiere, was tried the follow­ ing summer for an anti-Catholic article that added the word Intelligence to Liberty, Equality, Fraternit y.29 In his courtroom defen se, he called for inscr ibing on \"the proletarian banner these four organic words : charity, equality, fraternity, intellig ence.\" 3 0 F reedom had vanished from the list-as it had in Blanqui's earlier proclam ation of \"Unity, Equality, Fraternity,\" 31 and would again in the first Communist Banquet on July I, I84o, shortly after L'Intelligence had been forcibly shut. \"A new era has just begun for the world,\" the published account of this banquet for some one thousand artisans in the Belleville section of Paris proclaimed in bold italic s.3 2 A series of spe akers proceeded to invoke the word communist for the first time in pub lic , rejoicing that henceforth ordinary politicians ( routiniers politiqu es) would never be able to \"contain its explosive impact.\" 33 The words unity and equ ality recurred throughout the toasts. Their unity was to be \"perfe ct,\" \"indis­ soluble,\" and \"unalterabl e\" ; 34 their equality, \"re al, perf ect, and so-"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"2 4 8 THE DOMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES cial.\" 35 Community, common happiness, and probity were substituted for liberty in the revolutionary trilogy.3 6 The only toast that even used the word spoke of \"a general and all-inclusive liberty ... which cannot walk without leaning on its sister and companion equality.\" 37 Liberty was thus crippled from the beginning by commun ists. Their preference for unity and equality was made clear by the senior co­ sponsor and principal speaker at the banquet, the former priest Jean­ Jacques Pillo t. He called on all present to \"lay down upon the altar of equality all sentiment contrary to the great unity.\" a s He and the co­ sponsor of the banquet, Theodore Dezamy, were communistes imme­ diats 3 9 -and may be considered along with Laponneraye the true founders of modern communism. Unlike Benoit and his colleagues from Lyon, these three Parisian jour­ nalists were young intellectuals, divorced from personal contact with the working class. They were infatuated with the power of Intellig ence, the very title of Laponneraye's journal ; and it is hard to escape the suspicion that in some sense it was their own power they were seeking through intelligenc e. In the upwardly mobile atmosphere of the July monarchy, such youthful and bourgeois intellectuals represented the cutting edge of the \"revolution of rising expectati ons.\" The story of their pilgrimage to the new communist ideal begins- chronologically and ideologically-with Laponneraye . Laponneraye's Intelligence was the first journal successfully to trans­ pose the revolutionary visions of middle-class intellectuals into an appealing revolutionary message for the working class. Laponneraye developed two of the three new ideas that the first communists intro­ duced into French social thought : a class-oriented view of the French Revolution and a totalistic conception of popular education. He pro­ vided a new view of the one historical event that had meaning for even the most illiterate worker, that is, the French Revoluti on.40 He helped create a mythic view which has dominated subsequent communist his­ toriography : the simultaneous glorification of both the political leader­ ship of Robespi erre and the socio-economic aspirations of the Parisian proleta riat. These two elements had in fact often been in conflict, but they were unified retroactively in order to validate Laponneraye's own desire to provide elite leadership for proletarian power. The deification of Robesp ierre was a final legacy of the old Buonar­ roti to the new communis ts. In the last article Buonarroti wrote, \"Ob­ servations on Robespier re,\" he had reversed Babeufs negative view of the dictator, and glorified him as the true successor to \"Moses, Pythag­ oras, Lycurgus, Jesus and Mohamm ed.\" Robespierre alone had fought \"gangrene\" in society and laid \"the base to the majestic edifice of equal­ ity and the popular republic .\" 41 Laponneraye's popularly written works on French history presented the \"incorruptible\" Robespierre as a model for contemporary revolu­ tionaries in his dedication to public over private interest.4 2 Laponne­ raye glorified the political style of the Committee of Public Safety and engrossed himself in the first systematic edition of Robespierre's works, which appeared in three volumes in 1840.43"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"The Early Church (the 184os) 2 4 9 But he went further, suggesting that the mission of the cont emporary revolutionary was to combine Robespierre with Babeuf : authoritarian means with egalita rian ends. Babeuf's \"agrarian law\" was to be super­ seded by a more thorough \"repartition, pro-rated according to need,\" designed to create a totalistic \"community of rights, labors and duties.\" 44 The second element in the birth of the communist ideal was a new concept of intellectuals and educat ion. Laponneraye argued in his Dem­ ocratic Catechism for \"communal and unita ry\" indoctrination based on an alliance between \"intelligence and labor.\" For him educat ion was a means not just of spreading knowledge, but also of building a new type of human being \"in the midst of a society that has turned gan­ grenous with egoism and corruption .\" 45 This new type of educ ation sought \"the annihilation of egoism\" within man and the destruction within society of \"this moral anarchy in which intelligences are drow ned.\" 4 6 This reference to \"intell igences\" as an animate plural marks the be­ ginning of the fateful translation of the old idea of abstract intelligence into the modern ideal of an active intell igentsi a. Revolutionary vindi­ cation is guaranteed by the gathering force of intelligenc e-a category always implicitly understood to beg in with the writer and his readers. Such intelligence must penetrate and unite with the masses in order to free them from bourgeois corruption, which takes the political form of \"liberalis m, the off-spring of Girondist federalis m.\" 47 What is needed is \"a radical revolution in ways of life.\" 4 8 For this revolution, the pro­ letariat will play the role that the Third Estate assumed in 178g-by becoming conscious that it is nothing, and must become everythin g.49 This educ ational ideal was developed in an even more extreme man­ ner by the second major figure in the birth of communism : Theodore Dezamy. In an essay of 1839 for a contest of the French Academy on the failure to translate Enlightenment into practical morality, the eigh­ teen-ye ar-old Dezamy called for a tota lly new type of mass educati on : \"communal, egalitarian, harmonious ... industrial and agric ultural.\" 5 0 Elite educ ation of all kinds must be aboli shed. The more educ ation pen­ etrated the masses \"the more intelligence will come together.\" Strong central authority (\"a good social mecha nism\" ) was required to unify theory and practice, combine mental and physical development, and fill everyone with new \"habits of equality and fraternity .\" 51 Deza my argued that the social theorist-turned-revolutionary was the ideal \"intelligence\" for the new age-replacing the former hidden model of many social reformers : the medical doctor. There is no mirage more perfidious than to exalt medicine (o r law or literature ) over social sc ience .... I would compare the doctor to a tailor who puts new cloth on an old suit, and in closing a small hole opens up a larger one.5 2 Such writings announce the third and most import ant new element in the birth of communism : the metaphysical.

He im­ bued a tempestuous outpouring of pamphlets with an intensified belief in universalism and atheism, the antitheses of the dominant national­ ism and religiosity of the age . He developed (before Marx and inde­ pendently of the Ger mans) an inner certainty that he was building both the final science and the perfect society. Armed with such convictio n, Dezamy developed a polemic style that was qualitatively different from previous petty wrangling over the de­ tails of utopias or the motives of persona lities. He stressed the need to discipline intellect for the task of revolution . Leaders of the coming revolution would be neither \"believers\" ( croyants ) in any religion nor the \"wise men\" (savants ) to whom even Buonarroti had looked, but a new type of engaged intellectu al: the \"knowing ones\" ( sachants ) for whom \"the aim of philosophy . . . is to conduct men to happiness . . . by science .\" 53 The first task of the sachant was to rescue the \"primordial truths, general principles\" of communism from the sentimental distortions of it by the two most famous people identified with the label at the be­ ginning of the I 84os: the venerable Lamennais and the literary prophet of communism (whom Dezamy had once served as personal secretary), Etienne Cabet. Dezamy had initially joined these two in a united front of social revolutionary opposition to the rise of officially sponsored nationalism that followed the Blanquist insurrection of May 1839, the subsequent war scare with Germany, and the move from restrained occupation to full conquest of Algeria. Dezamy collaborated with Cabet in an antina­ tionalist compendium of 1840, French Patriots, Read and Blush with Shame ; 54 and Lamennais denounced the government's stationing of military forces in forts around Paris as \"new Bastilles.\" 55 Lamennais be­ came the first in a long line of idealistic radicals to be denounced by governing authorities as \"communist\" 56 -but was soon denounced in even stronger terms by Dezamy for not being communist enough. De­ zamy's excoriating pamphlet of 1841, Mr. Lamennais refuted by him­ se lf, sought to expunge religiosity from the commun ist label. 5 7 His pamphlet of the following year, Slanders and Politics of Mr. Cabet, criticized the vacillation ( girouetti sme) of his former mentor, and ar­ gued-for the first time-that ideological, and not merely political, dis­ cipline was necessa ry for communism. 5 s At issue once again was form as well as content, roles as well as rules. Cabet had established himself as the oracular interpreter of the new communist label. He had to be discredited if he were to be sup­ planted. He had attained his status through the highly traditional means of creating a literary utopia on an imaginary island (in Voyage to Icaria of I 839-40) and presenting a secularized version of a religious credo (in Communist Credo of 1841 ). Dezamy's alternative was his Code de la Communaute of 1842.

He began with a quote from Hobbes (\"In the community morality comes from things and not from men\" ) and ended with a fold-out chart of a \"communal palace\" where the communized men of the future would live. In be· tween lay an extended discussion of the ration ality and inevitability of social revolution against the compromises of reformist politics on the one hand and the diversion of national revolution on the other.

In the society of the future there would be one global congres humanitaire,6l a single lan­ guage (preferably a neutral, dead language like Latin ), 62 and a single form of service as \"industrial athl etes,\" 6 3 who would tran sform all tasks of construct ion into communal youth festivals . \"Travailleurs , unis­ sons-n ous!\" 6 4 Dezamy called out in anticipation of the Ma rxist \"Work­ ers of the world, unite !\" As an apos tle of unity and simplicity, Dezam y denounced the \"politics of diversion\" which seeks \"to detach and dis­ tract the workers from ega litarian and communist theor ies.\" 65 The logic of radical simplicity led Dezamy to insist that just as com­ munism was \"unitary,\" its victory would be univers al. \"Finished Com­ munism\" would exist only in a \"unive rsal country\" 66 that will super­ sede not just nationalism (which \"imprisons equ ality in the narrow circle of an egoist ic national ity\" ) 6 7 but also any other divisive alle­ giances such as famill isme. 68 There would be no \"new holy alliance against the first govemment embracing Commun ism ,\" 69 because its ideological appeal would spread rapidly and create \"the universal com­ munity.\" 7 ° Conflict among \"unitary Communists\" was logic ally imposs ible : No, no, there can be no splits among Commu nists; our struggles among ourselves can only be struggles of harmony, or reasoning . .. . 11 \"Communitarian principles\" contained \"the solution to all problem s.\" 72 The original French Revolution failed because it did not realize that such principles were \"the most powerful and most sublime arm for cutting down the enemies that had to be vanquish ed.\" Communism was . . . the sole, the unique means of dest roying, of guillotining in a stroke, not men, not your brothers, but on the contrary all the vices.73 Dezamy thus anticipated both the Maoist concept that only \"non­ ant agonist ic contradictions\" are possible among communists and the high Sta linist idea that killing dissenters is always portrayed as the ritual expulsion of some impersonal form of vice."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"252 THE DOMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES An alarmed French police investigator described Deza my's Code as a bluepr int for \"la communaute rigoureuse, mathematique et immedi­ ate.\" 74 His arre st and trial in 1844 attracted and inspired the most radical foreign intellectuals then in Paris : Arnold Ruge, Moses Hess, and Karl Marx among the Germans and Nicholas Speshnev among the Russia ns.75 In addition to their examples as ma rtyrs, the French founders left behind a legacy of unalterable opposition to supernatural religion. De­ zamy's last three major works argued in the course of 1845-46 for a ma terialist and atheist worldview to supplant Catholicism for \"the or­ ganization of universal well-bein g.\" 76 Already in his prize essa y of 1839, Deza my had spoken of \"this sub lime devotion which constitutes socialism\" 77 and bid the \"unhappy proletarians\" ... reenter into the gyre of the egal itarian church, outside of which there can be no salvation. 78 For Dezamy-as for his admirer Karl Marx-the atheism of his ma ture years was not \"just an historical or biographical accident,\" but \"an ess ential premise of his whole theory.\" 79 The former priest Pillot went even further with his insistence that \"Equals know neither God nor the devil.\" 8 0 British Influence Communism was transnational as well as antinational ist. If the French pioneers soon had German followers , they themselves had drawn more than is generally realized on Englim sour ces . England had become important in the repressive atmosphere of the late 183os as a sec ure place for revolution ary emigres to meet each other and publish freely. The Chartist movement in its early, semi-insurrectional stage provided an inspirational example for the awakening political imagina­ tion on the continent. By far the most important British catalyst on the early communists, however, was Robert Owen, who decisively in­ fluenced two very different founding fathers of modern communis m: Etienne Cabet and Goodwyn Barmby. Cabet spent most of the 183os in exile in England, where he first published clandest inely in 1839, his enormously influential Voyage to Icaria. The novelistic form of his Voyage was largely taken from En­ glish models,8 1 and the content was deeply influenced by the secular so­ briety of Owen, who provided Cabet with a rationalistic alternative to the romantic socialism of Fourier, which had hitherto domin ated the French imagination. Owen imparted a new, secular confidence that human nature could be transformed through a cooperative enviro nment. He also preached a lofty contempt for democratic reformi sm, calling instead for a social transformation outside politics and beyond political borders.

Owen presented a rationalistic alternative to the romantic moralism of the \"prophets of Paris\" and appealed to those who, like Cabet, had difficulty relating to the parliament ary perspectives of Whig reformers and Chartist radic als. Owen was a succes sful manu­ facturer who had founded concrete, cooper ative enterprises on an al­ legedly scient ific basis in both Britain and Americ a. Bitterly attacked by the visionary Fourieris ts, Owen attracted some support from the more scientistic Saint-Simoni ans, whose journal published in 1826 the first French discussion of Owen's \"System of Mutual Cooperation and Community of Goods.\" 83 French Fourier ists, in sea rch of a more rational basis for unity, al­ lied with Owenites in 1834-35. One Fourierist complained in May 1834 that the dream of \"un grand parti socialiste\" was still far away.84 In lodging the complaint, he defined the new ideal, which was brought into being by Owen's principal apostle in Franc e, the youthful editor Jules Gay. A disillusioned Fourieris t, Gay journeyed to London in 1835 seeking in Owenism a more scientific and revolution ary doctrine. He persuaded Owen to visit Paris in 1837 with the object ive of setting up a Maison Harmonienne to unify Saint-Simonianism , Fourie rism, and Owen ism. Owen also met with Buo narroti shortly before his death, and was feted by the Masoni c editor who headed the Universal Statistical Society. The sole organizational result was the est ablishment of a sma ll French affiliate of Owen' s Associ ation of All Classes of All Nat ions .85 Owen had earlier introduced and popularized terms like commu­ nionist and comm unional.86 His remarkable book of \"Social Hymns\" to be sung in the \"Halls of Science\" of new cooperat ive communities in­ voked the word repeatedly and lyrically : Community doth all possess T hat can to man be giv en : Community is happiness Community is heaven. 8 7 Increasing public attacks on Owen's atheism only intensified the mas­ ter's anticler icalism. In 1839, he changed the name of his associ ation to Universal Community Society of Rational Religio nists. At the same time, his teaching of scientific egalitarian community as the true goal of humanity provided new inspiration- through Gay-for those French­ men in the 1839-40 perio d- Dezamy and his associates-w ho intro­ duced the term commun ist.88 Moreover, as far afield as Russia, the Pocket Dictionary of the radical Petrashevsky circle used Owenism as its \"Aesopian\" entry for communism in 1846. Cabet himself, moreover, was so deeply influenced by Owen that the Icarian Communism he brought back from England to France has been des cribed by the leading authority as \"merely Owenism Frenchi fied.\" 89 Cabet returned to London in 1847 to seek Owen's direct sanct ion for his proj ect to organize communist emigration to Americ a. Owen in turn went to revolution ary Paris in March 1848; and his pamphlets there calling for a total social reorganization were denounced by the indigenous French Left as \"Com-"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"2 5 4 THE DOMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES munist.\" 9 0 Owen's final call for a new community \"of all classes, all parties and all religions\" 91 was echoed in Gay's short-lived journal of r849, Le Communiste. Cabet may also have derived his belief in the need for a revolutionary dictatorship from another British (or more properly, Irish) thinker, Bronterre O'Brien. 9 2 But Owen's emphasis on peaceful education kept Cabet from developing O'Brien's linkage of social revolution with Robes­ pierrist dictator ship into the full-blown authoritarianism of Dezamy and the younger generation in France. Meanwhile, another Englishm an, Goodwin Barmby gave a more exotic, religious twist to the pacific Owen­ He ideal and in the r84os became perhaps the most prolific-and surely the most forgotte n-propaga ndist for communism anywhe re. Christian Fantasies: Barmb y John Goodwyn (usually called Goodwin ) Barmby first popularized the term communism in England, linking it with inventive fantasies that were bizarre even for this period of florid social theory. Armed with a letter of introduction from Robert Owen, he journeyed as a twenty-year-old youth to Paris in r84o, seeking to escape from the \"melee of compet ition\" and the limitations of narrow nationalism 9 3 by establishing \"regular communication between the socialists of Great Britain and France.\" 9 4 Calling himself \"the friend of Socialism in France, in England, and the world,\" he promised to gather material for a definitive history of socialism and of \"all the systems of com­ munity\" ever devised. 95 He used the word \"commun ity\" to suggest rational Owenite organi­ zation as an antidote to Fourierist romantici sm. \"A Community is pref­ erable to a Phalanstere,\" he had proclaimed prior to his departure from England; 96 but upon arrival in Paris, Barmby was soon caught up in a whirl of Fourierist activities including socialist discussion groups, Four­ ierist concerts, and lectures on phrenology and \"societarian science\" in \"community coffee houses.\" 97 On June 20, Barmby presented \"the prospectus and papers of a pro­ posed 'International Association for the promotion of mutual inter­ course among all Nations' for which society a provisional committee was lately formed, under the presidentsh ip of an ardent friend of hu­ man progressism, in Paris.\" 98 The Association was designed for people from all countries and limited \"neither to sect or party.\" 99 Although nothing more is known about it, this lost document may well have been the first outline of an international communist organiz ation. It appears likely that its French president was Jules Gay. l 00 Barmby was pleased to report back to the Owenites in England that the communist banquet organized by Dezamy and Pillot at Belleville on July r served \"the community and not the Phala nstere.\" 1 o 1 Though Barmby later claimed to have invented the word commu­ nist, 1 02 his totemistic fascination with the word appears to have begun only after he realized that \"the public journals are all on fire at the Communist dinner at Belleville.\" 1 0 3 Barmby was determined not to let"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"The Early Church (the 184os) 255 the fire go out, and he began tracing \"the movements of the commu­ nists\" in Paris for his English Owenite readers, 10 4 The French govern­ ment immediately prohibited any further communist banquets in Paris. But smaller banquets were held in Rouen and Lyon; and Barmby an­ nounced late in August that a second communist banquet was to be held at the Institute of Childhood directed by Jules Gay's wife: a grand Fete in \"about a month\" to be built around the secular marriage cere­ monies of leading commu nists. Such hopes came to naught with the government crackdown in the face of widespread strikes late in the summer and the attempted assassination of the king early in the autumn . On his return to England, Barmby went wild with the new-found label. He founded a Communist Propaganda Society (soon renamed the Uni­ versal Communit arian Society ) 1 05 and a journal, The Promethean or Commu nitarian Apostle (soon renamed The Communist Chronicle ). He described communism as the \"societarian science\" and the final reli­ gion of humanity. His Credo proclai med: . . . I believe . . . that the divine is communism, that the demoniac is individualism .... 106 He wrote communist hymns and prayers, 1 °7 called for the building of Communit ariums, 1 08 under a supreme Communarchy headed by an elected Communarch and Communarc hess. l 0 9 He called himself \"Pon­ tifarch of the Communist Church,\" 11 o proclaimed the \"religion of COM­ MUNISM,\" 111 called for the rejection of Christ's claim to messia hship, and defined communism as a new fusion of Judaism with \"Christ ianism .\" 11 2 In March 1842, Barmby set forth the first communist theory of history: a scheme based on four ages of humanity (an early pastoral stage, \"paradization,\" which leads through feudalization and civilization to \"communization\" ). There were to be four successive stages of com­ munization (from a club or lodge through common production unit and communal city to a total communist society ). 11 3 He instituted a new calenda r and proclaimed a new vegetarian diet. From his central com­ munitarium at Barnwell he called for a restorat ion of the church lands confiscated by Henry VIII-not to the monasteries of the past, but to his \"communisteries\" of the future. 11 4 Barmby soon attracted the backing and counsel of a radical Chartist journalist, Thomas Frost, who transferred Barmby's publications to the veteran printer of the Left, Henry Hetherington. Barmby took advantage of WeHling's arrival in London to increase the size of his \"communion\" from 70 to 130. He wrote Book of Platonopolis, combining traditional utopian motifs (Platonopolis was the name given by Hupay to his orig­ inal \"philosophical community\" of I 779 ) with scientific projections for the future (including some yet to be realized such as a steam-driven auto­ mobile ). He drew up a list of forty-four Societar ian Wants for humanity and a plan of action that rapidly became almost global.

He sought links with radical sectarians planning to set up an egalitarian commune in Venezu ela. But, since they saw themselves only as a political-economic society, they could be considered only \"approximate Communists\" and a \"congregation,\" not a true \"commu­ nion\" of total spiritual commitm ent. 116 Barmby saw communism rendering politics as such obsolete, and he appears to have been the first to use a phrase incorrectly attributed to others: In the future, government politics will be succeeded by industrial ad­ ministration. 1 1 7 In his manic desire to realize heaven on at least a little part of earth, Barmby was driven to the outer islands of the British archipelago. On the Isle of Wight in 1844, he began devising plans for a model \"com­ munitarium\" on the Island of Sark. From there, he dreamed of estab­ lishing \"a community of printing and agriculture\" throughout the Chan­ nel Islands. Nothing came of it, and the more practical Frost rebelled and founded a Communist journal to rival Barmby's Communist Chron­ icle. Barmby in turn began the long history of communist excommuni­ catio ns. Viewing F rost's adoption of the word \"Communist\" as \"an in­ fringement of his copyright\" Barmby formally forbade its further use in a document that was \"sealed with a seal of portentous size, engraved with masonic symbols in green wax, green being the sacred color of the Communist Church .\" ns Isolated in his own fantasies, Barmby retreated to yet another island, the Isle of Man, to publish his Apostl e in 1848. No one there or any­ where else appears, however, to have submitted to the bizarre initia­ tion ritual that he prescribed to separate the \" ap p r o xi m a te\" commu­ nists from the real ones. His four-staged suggested baptismal rite was t o begin with a cold bath (the Frigidary), followed by a hot one (the Calidary), a warm one (the Tepidary ), and then vigorous exercise (the Frictionary ). All of this was then followed by anointment with oil and perfume : a secular chrism designed to prepare the candidate for \"the divine communiver se.\" 1 1 9 From dreams of an international movement (where progress was re­ corded nation by nation in his column \"Communist Intelligence\" ), Barmby moved on to become the first to speak of \"National Commu­ nism.\" 1 2 0 After a brief visit to Paris during the Revolution of 1848, he became a Unitarian minister, a friend of Mazzini, and a defender of national rather than social revolution . His colorful melange of secular utopianism and Christian ritual is illustrated by the subtitle of his journal of the forties : \"The Apostle of the Communist Church and the Communitive Life: Communion with"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"The Early Church (the 18 4 os) 2 57 God, Communion of the Saints, Communion of Suff rages, Communion of Works and Communion of Goods.\" Within his short-lived \"Commu­ nist Church ,\" Barmby saw the struggle for Communism in apocalyptical terms: In the holy Communist Church, the devil will be converted into God. And to this conversion of Satan doth God call peoples . . . in that Com­ munion of suffrages, of works, and of goods both spiritual and material ... for these latter days. 1 21 Thus, this pioneering communist proclaimed the death of the devil as decisively as later Communists were to announce the death of God. The rush to heaven on earth was, predictably, led by the Poles. In a book called Future of the Workers a Pole named Jean Czynski, the most revolutionary of the Fourieri sts, was the first to suggest syste­ matically that socialism was to be realized by workers rather than in­ tellectuals. Barmby translated the book into English .12 2 Cabet was even more dependent on another Polish emigre, the remarkable self-educated peasant, Ludwik Krolikowski. He was Cabet's close collaborator, and the first to popula rize a Christianized version of the new communist ideal in his extraordinary journal Poland for Christ. 1 2 3 In 1840 the first French journal conceived and edited by workers , L'Atelier, proclaimed to \"revolution ary workers ,\" that \"My kingdom is not now of this world\" 12 4 and carried an engraving of \"Christ preach­ ing fraternity to the world.\" 12\" Christ stood atop the globe trampling the serpent of egoism beneath his feet and brandishing a ribbon saying \"fraternity\" between angels in phrygian caps labelled \"equality\" and \"liberty\" 12 6-the iconography of the Holy Trinity blended with the trinitarian slogan of revolution. Other French revolution ary journals of the 1840s spoke of protest banquets as \"holy tables\" and \"holy communisi ons.\" 12 7 The infusion of Christian ideas represented for many \"not the degradation of Chris­ tian faith, but the regaining of religious enthusi asm.\" 128 In Germany, this tendency to identify communism with religion was widespread and more distinctively Christian . The only books cited by Weitling in his manifesto for the League of the Just, Hum anity as it is and as it should be, were the Bible and Lamennais's Words of a Be­ liever. Propagandists were aided by the tendency to identify commu­ nism with communion,1 29 and by the rhyming of fesu Christ with Kommunist in German .l3 0 An 1842 pamphlet in Paris by one of WeH­ ling's followers called fo r a new \"community of brotherly love\" and mutual assistance to bring \"pure Christianity\" into being among the workers.lB 1 Another follower penned a utopian dream of the new com­ munist order in the same year, bearing a title that harkened back to the Book of Revelation, but was to be revived by Hitler : The Thousand­ Year Kingdom (Reich) , 13 2 Religious fervor helped Weitling's Swiss Com­ munist movement attain by 1843 some 750 G e r m a n members in thir­ teen separate associa tions plus 400 French-speaking members. 1 33"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"258 THE DOMI NANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES Barmby purported to find Weitling's communism \"not a faith but a universal science,\" 1 34 and urged Weitling to go to Ireland to spread the new revolutionary doctrine. 1 3\" The arrest and trial of Weitling in 1843 and his subsequent expulsion from Switzerland embittered the original communists and inclined many towards an increasingly tough-minded and secular point of view. But religious themes remained powerful in the German movement, 1 3 6 and played a more important role in the revolutionary ferment of 1848-5I in Germany than is generally realized. 1 37 Indeed, communism probably would not have attracted such instant attention without this initial admixture of Christian ideas. This infu­ sion (I ) made credible the inherently implausible idea that a totally different social order was possible \"on earth as it is in heaven\" ; ( 2) convinced many that this new \"Communist\" order would fuse Babeuvist communaute with Christian communi on; and thus, (3) helped for the first time make a transnational social ideal compelling to significant numbers of pious working people. This debt to religious ideas usually remains unacknowledged or ob­ scured by revolution ary and communist historians-if not condemned out of hand as a retrograde flight from reality. But this turn to religion would seem to represent a \"progressive\" stage in the development of revolutionary movements-moving beyond the utopian experiments and speculat ions of Fourierist and Saint-Simonian intellectuals. Reli­ gious ideas activated the moral and social consciousness of a hitherto largely passive working class and helped secular intellectuals \"in the passage from utopia to reality.\" 1 3 8 For simple workers, it was easier to rally to a communism allegedly founded by \"the sublime egalitarian\" whose first communion was \"the image of future banquets\" for a communist society, 1 3 9 The hope for an international communist organization of a quasi­ religious nature was advanced by Barmby for a brief time in the im­ mediate aftermath of Weitling's arrival in London in 1844. This \"grand event\" should '1ay the basis by which the Communist Church in En­ gland and the Communist Church in Germany can act in concert to­ gether.\" Barmby publicly corresponded with \"the Primarchs of the Com­ munist Church of Ireland\" about the possibility of a joint mission ary trip there with Weitlin g. But already by 1845, the tide was turning to precisely the irreligious communism that Barmby feared. 1 4 0 Schapper, the most religious leader of the League of the Just, insisted against Weitling in that year that \"nothing transcendent\" be mixed in with their political discussions ; 141 and an Italian in Paris noted at the same time the rise of \"the specula­ tive and practical atheism of the Communist s.\" 142 The formation of the League of Communists in December 1847 represented the merger of the two key communist groups opposed to the religiosity of Weitling and Barmby : the London League of the Just and the Communist Cor­ respondence Committee of Brussels. The revolution ary atheism that Karl Marx derived from Ludwig Feuerbach was the new unifying force."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"The Early Church (the 18 4 os) Flight to Ameri ca? If the denial of God's heaven was essential to European revolutionary doctrine, so too was the rejection of the belief in a heaven on earth in Americ a. Throughout the nineteenth century, Europeans had escaped defeated revolutions in the Old World by fleeing to the land of suc­ cessful revolution in the New. Some came in person like Kosciuszko; others by proxy like Bonnev ille, who sent his wife and son when he himself was imprisoned by Napoleon. The revolutionaries provided sinew for the new state. If Kosciuszko helped design the battlements and early military manuals for West Point, Bonneville's son became one of its legendary early graduates-the first in a long list of former European revolutionaries to be military leaders in both the Mexican and Civil wars. Bonneville's wife, Margaret, became the companion of Thomas Paine in his last years. His son Benjamin was the aide to Lafayette on his visit to America in I825-26 and an explorer of the Far West celebrated in Washington Irving's book of I837: The Adventures of Captain Bonneville. Thus, Bonneville's own revolution ary career, which drew its original romantic inspiration from Schiller's plays as well as early revolutionary events in Paris, trailed off into literary ro­ mance as well as military history in Americ a. Flight to Americ a was, thus, a tradition among European revolut ion­ aries. When a number of European communists were to challenge Ca bet over this issue in the late I 84os, some of the luster was to be removed from this option. After the arrest of Weitling and the widespread trials and investiga­ tions of I843, Cabet, as the best-known propagandist of the communist ideal, had faced the problem of giving leadership to the inchoate move­ ment. His attempts to rally broad support against the communist trials of the mid-I84os in France led him to seek some form of transnational organization . He solicited the collaboration of both French and Ger­ mans in London for establishing a communal center of five to twenty members to coordinate international propaganda for communism. 1 43 However, he soon conceived a plan for establishing a much larger settlement in Americ a. He turned his energy to enlisting twenty to thirty thousand \"communists\" for a massive emigration to Americ a. He envisaged this voyage to a New World \"Icaria\" not just as an es­ cape, but as an attempt \"to create a new direction\" for the European movement as wellJ44 In so doing, Cabet was only expanding on the tradition established by followers of Fourier and Owen, whose major communal experiments had also been founded in Americ a. Indeed, he planned to visit Owen, \"the venerable patriarch of English Communism,\" in England during I 84 7 to secure a kind of blessing for his project. Cabet's project was, however, criticized by the Germans in London, who insisted that communism be set up in Europe instead. 145 The Lon­ doners were echoing the harsh denunciation by Marx the year before of He rmann Kriege, the leading German revolutionary editor in America,"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"260 THE DoMI NANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIEs for suggesting that the proletariat could gain a fresh start by settling the empty spaces in America. Marx's position had been supported by all of the Communist Correspondence Committee in Brussels except Weit­ ling, who had already left to join Kriege in America. l 4 6 In arguing for revolution in Europe rather than flight to America, the German communists in London echoed in amplified form a Buonarro­ tian position of the I 83os that had gone almost unnoticed outside nar­ row conspiratorial circles. The Buonarrotians in Paris had opposed the flight of Saint-Simonians to the East as escapism; and, almost alone among active European revolutionaries of the I 83os, they remained hostile to the American experiment. This attitude was expressed by unprecedented attacks on the two most admired European participants in the American Revolution who had subsequently become semilegend­ ary figures : Kosciuszko and Lafayette. 1 47 In any case, it was the fact that nineteenth-centu ry America absorbed rather than rearmed the many revolutionaries who came to her shores. (T he numbers increased sharply after the revolutions of I848 failed in Europe .) Cabet's Icarian communists settled first in Texas, then in Nauvoo, Illinois; soon quarreled among themselv es; then melted into the larger society, as had earlier secular utopians in the New World. Cabet died in St. Louis in I856, rejected by his few remaining followe rs. The only serious movement of social revolutionaries to reach America w.as the First Internat ional, which, however, did not arrive until I872 after it had already fallen apart and needed a decent place of burial. And when the First International formally collapsed in Philadelphia in I876, hardly anyone in America even noticed. Erstwhile revolution­ aries had become new Americans; and popular attention was fixed on the centennial celebrations in the same city-the city of America's own, quite different revolution. The continuing struggle \"between the proletariat and their oppres­ sors\" was to be fought-as the Buonarrotians had foreseen-primarily in Europe. Indeed, the only revolution ary movement to be based in Americ a in the last half of the nineteenth century was the narrowly national Irish Republican Brotherhood. 1 4 8 There is irony in all th is, because the original American Revolution had given birth to the radically new idea that a purely political party­ without religious or dynastic sanctions-could be the legitimate object of supreme, if not total, human dedication. In the aftermath of inde­ pendence, Americans had developed intense political passions and \"party spirit\" as they sought substance for the political life required by their new Constitution. 14 9 In the course of the nineteenth century, however, America increasingly defined parties more in terms of shared material interests than of shared spiritual ide as, and measured \"party spirit\" by precisely the kind of reformist electoral activity that by the I84os the rising generation of European social revolutionaries had come to hate.

Nor is it surprising that European social revolutionaries in the post-Jacksonian 184os had not looked to American models in their efforts finally to form a party. In the repressive atmosphere on the eve of 1848, it was difficult for Euro­ peans to share the distinctively American political faith of John Adams that \"the blessings of society depend entirely on the constitutions of government.\" 15 0 The first attempt by communists to form a party and develop \"party spirit\" grew not out of the old hopes of the New World, but out of new hopes in the Old World. The new party for which Marx wrote his manifesto late in 1847 was a largely imagin ative anticipation of the more substantial \"party of a new type,\" complete with sacrificial \"party spirit\" (partiin ost'), which Lenin created in 1903. Communists of the 184os had even less impact on the revolution which followed in 1848 than did Lenin's Bolsheviks on the Revolut ion of 1905. There is, neve i theless, a special importance to studying this first appearance of a communist party in human history. It is an event that should play for later communists something of the role that the Incarnation -or perhaps Pentecost-plays for Christia ns. Eccles ia: A New Party French social thinkers had long dreamt of a political party of an al­ together different type from the quarreling factions of the restoration . They wanted a party faithful to \"the movement \" that had produced the original revoluti on: 151 an associat ion that had both higher prin­ ciples and deeper roots than the bourgeois politicians of the July mon­ archy. The rallying cries of the pre- 1830 revolutionar ies-constitution, republic, liberalism-were increasingly rejected; but the new genera­ tion in the late 183os and early 1840s was not yet quite ready to accept a direct call for social revolution. Instead, they turned back to the old term of the 1790s: democracy- often fortifying it with the adjectives true or revolutionary. Democracy was associated with the unfulfilled hopes-social as well as political-of the French revolutionary tra­ dition,152 The term had also acquired romantic new identification with \"the people\" in Lamennais's sense of the unenfranchised and unfed masses. Victor Considerant transformed Fourierism into a new socialist polit­ ical movement by changing the title of his journal from Phal ange to Peaceful Democracy. He spoke of the need for a \"social party\" to ful­ fill the needs of a \"modern democracy.\" 153 It was in rivalry to Con­ siderant's Manifesto of Peaceful Democracy that Karl Marx wrote his Communist Manifesto late in 1847. Marx was seeking to create just such an ideological \"social party\"-but it was to be revolutionary rather than peaceful, communist rather than socialist.

The more authoritarian the early communist writers became in their revolution ary plans, the more insistent they were on the \"demo­ cratic\" nature of these plans. Pierre Leroux led the way, proclaiming that total democracy was the only possible sanction for modern au­ thority and insisting that democracy was not only a \"sacred word,\" 1 55 but a \"religion\" 1 56 cap able of providing \"a peaceful solution of the problem of the proletar iat.\" 1 57 He led George Sand and Louis Blanc into popular journalism through his Revue Independante during 1841-48. The new radical journalis ts, however , were having difficulty trans­ lating this sacred symbol-democracy-into political reality. Theo­ phile Thore was thrown into prison in 1840 for telling The Truth about the Democr atic Party, which was that it must serve \"the interest of the most numerous and deserving classes, of the working people.\" 1 5 8 Con­ vinced that many \"Communists are in the great democra tic current,\" 15 9 Thore persevered in trying to connect the two movements in Leroux's journa} 1 6 0 _prompting a rebuke from the possessive Cabet, The Demo­ crat turned Communist in spite of himself. 1 6 1 Out of the more radical new communist journals which had sprung up in 1841, that is, L'Humanitaire and La Fraternite, first came the unequivocal suggestion that the \"democratic party\" must in the modern era be a \"communist party.\" Most of these original communists were little more than twenty years old. They felt that the promise of 1830 had been betrayed, and that even their older mentors, Cabet and Leroux, might be in danger of \"decapitating the future.\" 162 It seems appropriate that the first use of the term Communist Party appears to have been by the journal of the young Dezamy announcing the death of Buonarroti's last old comrade-in-ar ms, Voyer D'Argenson in August 1842. l 63 A Franco-German Alliance As for the Young Hegelians in Germany, it was not until they began to look toward their counterparts in France that they became truly revo­ lutionary. 1 6 4 The original link between the Young Hegelians and the new generation of French social revolutionaries had been Moses Hess, the Paris correspondent of Die Rheinische Zeitung .

Belinsky in 1840 hailed Heinrich Heine, the radical German poet living in Paris, as \"a German Frenchman-precisely what Germany now needs most of all.\" 170 Bakunin's summons to violent upheaval was published under a French pseudonym in the German Yearbook of 1842. Another Russian, Bakunin's future friend and sometime collaborator, Alexander Herzen , hailed that article as evidence of the emerging alliance between French politics and German philosophy, \"the beginning of a great phase of acti­ vization [Betii tigung ]\" of the European revolutionary movement .171 The editor of the German Yearbook, Arnold Ruge, expressed the hope that Bakunin's article would make \"some sluggards get up from their beds of laurels\" and begin working for \"a great practical future.\" 17 2 Ruge played a central role as the oldest of the \"young\" Hegelians, bring­ ing with him an aura of martyrdom from having spent most of the 182os in prison. His Halle Yearbook of German Science and Art in 1840 provided the first authoritative vehicle for declaring the victory of the revolutionary \"philosophy of action\" over the contemplativeness of pre­ vious German philosoph y.173 His rapid success ion of journalistic ex­ periments became the medium for this \"philosophy of action,\" just as treatises and lectures had been the m edium for the earlier \"contem­ plative\" philosophy. His Halle Yearbook became the Germa n Yearbook, which in turn gave birth among his followers late in 1841 to Die Rheinische Zeitung : a deliberate challenge in the newspaper world to the conserv ative Kolnische Zeitung. In 1843, Ruge began to give the Hegelian \"party\" a revolutionary political line by seeking to \"cleanse\" Hegelianism of Hegel's own moderate liberalism and by urging Ger­ many to \"transform liberalism into democracy.\" 174 Thus he introduced the Germans to the French communists' polemic technique of juxtaposing true democracy and false liberalism . He was soon forced to begin a hegira of Hegelians to Paris. He had fled from Prussia in 1841, only to be banished from Saxony (and to see Rheinische Zeitung shut) early in 1843.

Enter Karl Marx The man who came closest to fulfilling this task was Ruge's young journalistic protege, Karl Marx. The decisive works in which it was per­ formed were Marx's lengthy critique of Hegel's The Philosophy of Right, written in the summer of 1843, and his introduction of the following year to the same work. In criticizing Hegel's last and most political work, Marx applied for the first time his so-called transformative method -reversing the role of matter and spirit-to politics. In the introduc­ tion, he used \"proletariat\" and \"communist\" for the first time as labels of liberation. 175 Hegel had contended that beyond subject ive \"civil society\" lay a higher and more universal social objective: the state. The identifi­ cation of the state as \"the march of God through history\" may represent the overenthusiasm of the auditor whose notes on Hegel's lecture were posthumously turned into The Philosophy of Right. Hegel was, in any case, speaking of an ideal, rather than an existing German state. Never­ theless, Hegel did see a universally liberating mission for the state and for its dedicated \"universal class\" ( der allgemeine Stan d): the dis­ interested bureaucracy. Marx turned this analysis on its head by beginning with states as they actually existed in 1843. Hegel had seen civil society as the imperfect anticipation of an ideal state. Marx described the state as a degraded expression of the controlling material interests in \"civil society\" -the term bilrgerliche Gesellschaft now acquiring some of the overtones of \"bourgeois\" as well as \"civil\" society. The state bureaucracy was the agent of venal interests rather than of any universal mission. The concept of a \"universal class\" was revived a year later in Marx's introduction to Hegel's work, and applied to the \"proletariat\" -a term that Marx used for the first time in this purely philosophic al, Hegelian sense. The \"abolition of private property,\" which the proletariat was to accompl ish, was not initially related to any analysis of either capital­ ism as a whole or the proletariat in particular. The liberating mission of the proletariat was, however, closely re­ lated to the establishment of \"true\" democracy by universal suffrage. Venal civil society controlled the state through the institution of prop­ erty, and even advanced forms of representative governments main­ tained a property requirement for the vote. Universal suffrage would accompany and insure the advent of universal property. The abolition (Aufhebung, also meaning uplifting and transformin g) of property would also involve the abolition of the state. As with proletariat, Marx first used \"communistic\" in this philosophical-political context. The ab­ olition of the old political system through universal suffrage would. Marx insis ted, \"bring out the true communistic aspect of men.\" Thus, Marx related the achievement of communism to the cause of"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"The Early Church (the 18 4 os) universal suffrage. At the same time, the univers ality which Hegel ex­ pected to realize in the ideal state must now be realized instead by abolishing the existing state. Like other radical Hegelians, Marx dreamed of a politics to end all politics. The Hegelian concept of a \"universal class\" leading humanity to an earthly millennium through a clash of opposites was retained: Just as philosophy finds its mat erial weapons in the proletariat, so the proletariat finds its intellectual weapons in philosophy .... Philosophy is the head of this emancipation and the proletariat is its heart. Philosophy can only be realized by the abolition (A ufhebung ) of the proletariat, and the proletariat can only be abolished by the realization of philosophy. l 7 6 The young Marx was seeking cosmic compens ation for political frus­ tration. The Prussian government had failed to realize the exaggerated Hegelian hopes of its becoming \"the incarnation of objective moral­ ity.\" 1 77 Therefore all government-indeed the very business of gov­ ernmen t-had to be superseded. This eschatologic al vision was given social content largely by Moses Hess. Through Hess's elaboration of Proudhon, Marx first came to see private property as the root cause for the degradation of man and the ineffectiveness of political reform in bourgeois society. 178 It was also Hess who first introduced Marx in 1843 to his lifelong collaborator, Frederick Engels , who called Hess \"the first Communist in the party\" and \"the first to reach Communism by the philosophical path.\" 179 Together with Engels, Hess evolved just such a philosophical concept of a communist party. Developing Hess's idea of a \"European triarchy\" in a series of articles during 1843, Engels insisted that a German communist movement would arise not out of the \"compara­ tively small\" working class, but \"among the educated classes.\" 180 Hess and Engels began denation alizing the revolutionary ideal by adding French and English perspect ives to those of the Berlin Hegel­ ians. Hess tried to provide a transnational outlook by publishing in 1844 in the Paris journal Vorwiirts the first of a series of communist catechisms. l8 1 The special contribution of the young Marx in 1844-45 was to identify this still-idealistic concept ion of a communist party with both the pre­ tensions of science and the destiny of the proletariat. The idea of a \"sci­ entific\" socialism based on historical materialism and a rigid theory of class was \"uniquely and exclusively\" 182 the work of Marx-so Engels later insisted. The first stage was Marx's break with Ruge over the meaning of an unsucces sful weavers' revolt in Silesia in I 844. Ruge, the doyen of radical Hegelian journalis ts, argued for better political organiz ation and educat ion of the workers. Marx urged, instead, deeper study of the causes of poverty and greater faith in the universal mission of the Ger­ man proletariat. Members of the proletariat were to become the theore­ ticians of the world proletarian movement just as the English were to be its economic and the French its political leaders .183 In his The Holy Family of the same year, Marx broke altogether with"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"266 THE DOMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES the Hegelians-and by implication with his own previous intellectual­ ism. He held up as the model instead the recently suppressed German workers' movement led by Weitling in Switzerland. Two years later, Marx denounced Weitling's Christianized communism (and, more broadly, sentimental idealism ) in his German Ideology. Marx used \"ide­ ology\" as a term of abuse for the self-deceptions of German intellec­ tuals. But he himself was, at the same time, creating an ideology in the modern sense: a secular system of ideas based on a theory of his­ tory that ultimately promised answers for all human problems. The \"Communist Party\" for which Marx soon wrote his manifesto was \"ideological\" in this latter sense. Marx's polemics against his seeming allies on the Left during the formative period of this \"party\" reflected his personal desire to annex a pedagogic position with the rising proletariat analogous to that which Hegel had held over the rising Prussian elite for an earlier generation at the University of Berlin. Before turning to the Communist League, which became Marx's \"party\" in I 84 7-48, it is important to trace Marx's own quest for a political party to believe in. This search paralleled his philosophical quest and antedated his discovery of either communism or the proletariat. In his doctoral dissertation of 1841, Marx had placed faith in \"the liberal party as a party of a concept ... [which] realizes real prog­ ress.\" 184 Though soon disillusioned with liberals, he did not immedi­ ately embrace those who called themselves socialists and commun ists. These seemed to him to be more interested in economic theories than in actively advancing \"a concept.\" 1 8 5 Marx defended himself late in 1842 against the accusation of being a \"commun ist,\" 1 86 and insisted in the following year that communism was only \"a dogmatic abstrac­ tion . a particularly one-sided application of the socialist principle.\" 1 8 7 Marx's move to Paris in 1843 immersed him in French revolution ary history , and his friendship with Engels introduced him to the study of English economics. Spurned by real-life radicals in Paris (with whom he, Hess, and Ruge attempted to collaborate in the new German­ Fren ch Yearboo k),1 SS Marx \"discovered\" the distant German proletariat as the force for revolutionary deliver ance. The thought gradually rip­ ened that the longed-for movement of theory into action might in fact be taking place through the \"constitution of the proletariat into a class\" about which Flora Trista n had spoken in forming her international pro­ letarian society in 1843 : the union ouvriere. Politically, the task of the proletariat was the conquest of democ­ racy, which had been compromised by liberalism. Ideologically, the mission was to realize the \"huma n emancip ation\" that lay beyond the purely political gains of past revolutio ns: 189 to bring into being what Marx described in his Philosophical Manus cripts of 1844 as \"realized humanism\" or \"naturalism.\" By the time of his expulsion from Paris early in 1845, Marx described both his and humanity's goal as \"Commun ism.\" This Communism is like realized naturalism which equals humanism which equals naturalism .. .. 1 90"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"The Early Church (the 184os) A Finished Ideolo gy The crucial new element that Marx brought to communism was dialectical materialism. Here at last was a finished revolutionary ideol­ ogy with a dynamic historical outlook. It was perfected in the three years he spent in Brussels-1845-48-which were the happiest of his life. Marx forged there the long-sought revolutionary link between France and Germany. But it was not the alliance of active forces envis­ aged by Hess and Ruge so much as a merger of elements from the two universal ideologies of the preceding era: Saint-Simonianism and Hegelianism. Philosophically, Marx drew most basically on three new attitudes charact eristic of radical Hegelians in the early 184os: negativism, ma­ terialism , and atheism. One has to use Hegel's own dialectical method to explain how such revolutionar y ideas could be derived from a politi­ cally moderate, philosophical ly idealist, sincerely Lutheran , and patrio­ tic Prussian professor like Hegel. It seems, indeed, an \"ironic\" develop­ ment of \"antitheses,\" through which the \"cunning of reason\" expressed the \"spirit of the times.\" Having placed exaggerated initial hopes in the Prussian state, restless Young Hegelians rationalized their disillusionment in the early 184os by cultivating the sublime idea of its total destruction . Since history proceeds through contradictions (the dialectical \"negation of nega­ tion\"), and since the state had become a negative force, their historical duty was to \"negate\" the state. Radical Hegelians also moved from idealism to philosophi cal material­ ism in the mid-184os. Ludwig Feuerbach championed the thought that Hegel's \"spirit of the times\" was nothing more than a conglomeration of material forces. \"Man is what he eats,\" he argued in a character­ istic ally inelegant pun ( isst, \"eats,\" ist, \"is\"). Feuerbach later went so far as to explain the failure of the Revolution of 1848 by the dulling effects of a potato diet on the lower classes. 1 91 In August 1844, Ma rx confessed to a \"love of Feuerbach 1 92- a senti­ ment he rarely expressed-for pointing the philosophical way to so­ cialism. Feuerbach had substituted materialism for ide alism while re­ taining a monistic , deterministic view of history. Materialism in the 18 4os attracted some of those preoccupied with industrialization in northern Europe. By reasserting the monism and determinism of Hegel, Feuerbach reassured radicals that the tension between moral ideals and material reality was only at the level of appearan ces. Marx introduced the dynamic idea of dialectical progression into this materialistic monism. Like other earlier metaphysical determinisms (Islam, Calvinism ), dialectical materialism provided, paradoxically, an effective call to action. His Theses on Feuerbach, written shortly after his move to Brussels, was for Engels \"the first document in which is deposited the germ of the new world outlook.\" 19 3 It contained his famous dictum : Philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways. The time has come to change it.194"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"268 THE DOMI NANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONAHIES A third area of borrowing from the radical Hegelians was Marx's athe­ ism. Whereas Hegel had identified God with the totality of history, his followers took God totally out of it. In a sense, Hegel had prepared the way by placing philosophy above religion, and by subordinating all Gods to his own concept of an all-controlling \"world spirit.\" Contem­ poraries viewed this as tantamount to atheism; and \"the vehemence of attacks from religious quarters on Hegel can perhaps be compared to the reaction in England to Darwin.\" 1 95 Struggle with religion, the original cause to which the young, pre­ political Hegelians had rallied in 1837-38, 19 6 reached a high level of sophistication in Feuerbach's Essence of Chris tianity of 1841. He dis­ tinguished the \"true or anthropologic al essence of religion\" (man's need for higher moral purpos e) from its \"false or theological essence\" (be­ lief in God). Marx broke only with Feuerbach's effort to create a new secular religion. However religious in nature, Marx's ideology could never be religious in name. The insistence that it was \"scientific\" helped protect it against the ebb and flow of enthusiasm that plagued rival revolutionary doctrines. Lenin later rejected \"God-building\" tendencies within his movement, and subsequent Marxist-Leninists have consis­ tently rejected religious allegiances of any kind within their ranks. Feuerbach prepared the way for revolutionary atheism by inventing the Hegelian belief that God created man out of his spiritual need to overcome divine alienation. Feuerbach suggested that, on the contrary, man had created God out of his material need to overcome human alien­ ation. To Marx, this suggested that alienation was to be solved not by spiritual, but by material forces. Both the source and the cure lay in political economy ; its driving force was not ideas but social classes. The class of the future-the class to end all classes-was the prole­ tariat, which had arisen inevitably out of the conflict of the bourgeois with the feudal order. All alienation would be overcome-and all need ended for the Gods that mask repression-w hen the proletariat over­ came its alienation from the means of production that it did not own. Thus the social revolution so widely discussed in the 184os-the forcible confisc ation of the means of producti on-became in Marx's analysis the inevitable, necessary, and culminating act of history. Marx became the first to argue consistently that the social revolution was to be made not only for, but by the proletariat. The intellectual seeking \"relevance\" could find it only through the working class. Marx grafted certain key Saint-Simonian beliefs onto his Hegelian view of history : the liberating potential of the Industrial Revolution , the need for a \"scientific\" analysis of society by classes, the historical destiny of \"the poorest and most numbrous class.\" The German writers from whom he and his friends had learned about French revolutionary thought-Hess in the late 183os, Stein in the early 184os-had both attached special importance to Saint-Simonianism. Also, Marx's native town of Trier had been a center of the new Saint-Simonian teaching. 1 97 The small group of German emigres to whom Marx sought to impart his ideology represented an authentic revolutionary intelli gentsia­ more coherent than the Saint-Simonians of a decade earlier, and more"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"The Early Church (the 184os) explicitly revolutionary. The dialectical method offered insurance against disillusionme nt; ma terialism provided relevance in a time of growing socio-economic stress ; and, most important of all, Marx was an indefatigable ideological leader. Karl Marx remained basic ally a He gelian intellectual-always relating individual parts of his analysis to a broader context, writing with voracious interest yet emotional sobriety about an astonishing variety of subjects. The admixture of Saint-Simonian ideas and other Anglo­ French social theories helped Marx bring Hegel back \"from the blue skies to the kitchen.\" 1 98 Establ ishing the Movement But where were the troops for Marx's ideological army? Was there any body attached to his head? Weitl ing, the wa ndering tailor from Ma gdeburg and Paris, had formed among Germans in Switzerland the first workers' group to call itself communist. Relocated in London, he began in Febru ary 1845 a year­ long, intermittent discussion with Scha pper's more moderate German emigre-faction. Weitling argued that the time was ripe for revolution, which could be ma de in alliance with criminals and youth on the one hand and with kings and princes on the other .199 Scha pper's group argued for reliance on the communist education of the working classes and rejected Weitling's willin gness to tolerate violence and \"the com­ munism of Princes\" (Filrstenkommunis mus). 2 oo But Weitling argued that \"simple propaganda helps nothing,\" 2 01 and would not be effective unless it promised people a social revolution in their own lifetime. Schapper, on the other hand, said that communism must strengthen the ability \"to develop oneself freely,\" 202 and \"a real system will be developed by our new German philosophers .\" 20 3 The way was clear for Marx and Engels to steer a new path between Weitling's militance and Sch apper's moralism. Across the channel in Brussels, they seem to have derived some inspiration from former friends and followers of Buon arroti. They planned to publish a German trans­ lation of History of the Babeuf Conspi racy which Buon arroti had pub­ lished there and adopted the Buon arrotian jux taposition of \"egoists\" and \"Commu nists.\" 2 0 4 On their first visit to London from July 12 to August 20, 1845, they took the elitist high grou nd- avoiding the quarrelin g Ger­ man workers and discussing international collaboration with radical democrat ic intellectuals in the Weber Street pub. 20 5 Engels sta yed on alone for the Chartist Fes tival of Na tions in September. Excited that \"a Chartist meeting became a Communist festival,\" he wrote that \"Democ­ racy in our days is Communism .\" 20 6 Against this backg round of asso­ ciation with bourgeois democrats rather than German workers, Engels used for the first time the term \"proletarian part y.\" 207 Marx worked first through his Communist Corr espondence Committee in Brussels , an orga nization of about fifteen German writers and type­ setters closely linked with Belgian radical intell ectuals.

Marx had been unable to gain followers among Germans in Switzerland where Weitling's influence was still strong, and, despite energetic proselytizing by Engels, had won over only one small element of the Parisian German colony (the furniture carpenters ). After driving Weitling to America and Proudhon into animosity in the sum­ mer of I846, Marx and Engels turned for allies to Karl Schapper's group in London, the League of the Just. Since I84o, this group (though smaller than the Parisian branch of the league ) had placed itself at the head of two German worker education associations with some five hundred members including French, Scan­ dinavian, and Dutch emigres. The London league established formal contact with Marx's committee in Brussels on June 6, I846, through a long letter from Schapper, Joseph Moll, and seven other \"of the most diligent local Commun ists. \" 2 1 0 They described a vigorous collective life: three meetings a week for their two hundred fifty members (nearly half of them non-German ), biweekly gatherings with Harney's group (called Fraternal Democrats ), and an educational program including song and dance instruct ion and a small library in many languages. 211 Though he preferred Marx's concept of a \"thorough [tilchtig] revolu­ tion\" based on an \"intel lectual [geisti ge] revolution\" to Weitling's un­ scientific \"inanity,\" Schapper confessed to having once feared that Marx might fan \"the scarcely suppressed hate between intellectuals and workers\" and install some new \"aristocracy of the learned [Gelehrten­ Aristokratie] to rule the people from your new throne. \" 2 1 2 In October I846, Engels defined \"the aim of the Communists\" as sup­ port of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie through a \"violent demo­ cratic revolution\" that would end private property and establish a \"com­ munity of goods\" (Gutergemeinschaft). 2 1 3 Police repression of the Paris branch of the league forced the London league to assume international leadership in this effort. In November I846, its members called for a \"powerful party \" to be formed in London around a \"simple communist creed, which could serve everyone as a rule of conduct.\" A congress of the league was called for May I, I847, to prepare for an international congress the following year of \"the supporters of the new thought (neue Lehre ) from all regions of the world.\" 2 1 4 This call singled out three pressing problems for the forthcoming congress to resolve : (I) alliances with bourgeois-radical groups, ( 2) attitude towards religion, and ( 3) the unification of all \"social and communist parties.\" 2 1 5 In January I847, Moll journeyed from London to cement links with Marx in Brussels and with Engels in Paris. These"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"The Early Church (the 18 4 os) 2 7 1 two provided the London group in the course of the next year with comprehensive answers to all three of its questions. On the question of unification, Marx suggested that unity be based on a revolutionary ideology-universally valid but centrally defined. He inveighed against both the \"economists,\" who accepted passively the logic of capitalist economic development, and the \"socialists,\" who contented themselves with private experim ents. 2 16 Only a clear re­ cognition of the basic antagonism between the bourgeoisie and pro­ letariat would prepare the latter for the \"struggle of class against class, which carried to its highest expression is a total revoluti on.\" 217 Marx used the early part of 1847 to write his Poverty of Philoso phy against Proudhon . This was a dramatic assertion of his own authority against a better-known rival, who had defied him both organizationally and ideologically, and also a text for discussion of the \"new doctrine.\" Later in 1847 Marx arrived in London secure in his vision of revolution­ ary eschatology. Having exposed the \"poverty\" of his principal continen­ tal rival, he now brought the riches of philosophy to the German colony in London, which was built around \"educat ion\" associations and was awed by the German intellectual tradition . Armed with his ideology, Marx and Engels now proceeded to offer solutions to the two other tac­ tical problems facing the League of the Just: the attitudes towards religion and towards bourgeois radicalism. The question of religion was in many ways the most difficult. The proleta riat in London had never accepted the philosophic atheism of Berlin and Paris intellectuals like Marx and Dezamy. At the London congress of the League of the Just from June 2 to June g, the old \"utopian\" idea of directly establishing a quasi-apostolic \"community of goods\" among workers was still favored-along with the catechism form for expounding \"Communist articles of faith.\" Engels was ap­ parently the principal author of the creed of the London congress which concluded : All religions up to now ha ve been the expression of the historical develop­ mental stages of individual peoples or masses of peop les. Communism, however, is the developmental stage which makes all existing religions superfluous and abolishes them .21 s Engels verb for \"abolition,\" the Hegelian aufheben, suggested uplift to a higher level of synthesis. The tone was condescending and intel­ lectual. But there was not yet any statement of a clear, alternative world view. At a second congres s, from November 29 to December 8 of that same year, the league defined its purpose as the abolition of property and of the bourgeois class as such. Historical materialism was accepted as the basis for a party statement, which Marx was asked to write. The Communist Manifesto resolved a year of ideological infighting within the League of the Just. The decision to change the name to Communist League (and the first use of the slogan \"Workers of the world, unite!\") had emerged from the June congress where Marx's in-"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"2 7 2 THE DOMI NANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES fluence was still small. Subsequent discussion and propagation of the new Marxist perspective within individual branches of the league ap­ pear to have tipped the balance. In late October or early November, Engels composed for the Paris branch \"Princi ples of Communism\" de­ signed to combat \"The Communist Confession of Faith\" drafted by the London branch the previous month. Objecting to the catechistic form, 2 1 9 Marx went to London himself to try to seal the debate at the second congress of the league. The quasi-religious perspective of figures like Schapper sharpened the debates which lasted for ten days. But Marx prevailed, and the first paragraph of the new program bluntly announced that \"the aim of the League is the downfall of the bourgeoisie, the rule of the proletariat .... and the foundat ion of a new form of society devoid of classes and private property .\" 220 At the same time, Marx also shaped the approach of the new league to the third and last of its unresolved problems : the attitude towards bourgeois-radical political parties. Like other communists of the forties, Marx had opposed the secretive, conspirat orial past of the revolutionists and defined communism as the fulfillment of political democracy. The arguments for an alliance between democrats and communists were par­ ticularly forceful in London, where the Chartists' struggle for civil rights seemed to aid their own educational and organizational work. The tactical alliance between prolet arian and bourgeois revolution­ aries was put into practice in London through Engels's links with the English Chart ists. Concurrently, Marx's Communist Correspondence Committee in Brussels participated in the activities of the Belgian Fra­ ternal Democrats, and acquired a new designation as the German dem­ ocratic communists in Brussels. 2 21 Many of its members joined local Belgians in founding the Democratic Association of Brussels in I 84 7 with Marx as one of the vice-pre sidents. Marx's trip to London, which enabled him to participate in the second congress of the Communist League, was made possible by an invitation from the London Fraternal Democrats to its Belgian affiliate. 222 The importance of a united front with bourgeois democratic forces was thus naturally stressed by Marx. After returning to Brussels from London, he became president of the Brussels Democratic Association. 22 3 The tactic of cooperation with other democratic parties was spelled out in the fourth and final section of Marx's Manifesto. Only communists could represent the true class interests of the proletariat, but they needed to ally themselves with radical democratic parties in advanced countries-and with agrarian revolutionaries in backward lands like Poland. Communists needed to support \"every revolution ary movement against the existing social and political order of things,\" but at the same time \"bring to the front, as the leading question in each, the property question .\" Ma rx saw all this being done openly-and in some sense with the \"agreement of the democratic parties of all countries .\" 224 Thus Marx provided guidance on all three of the problems from the original 1846 agenda of the League of the Just. He offered ideological unity, rejected religious idealism, and suggested tactical cooperation"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"The Early Church (the 18 4 os) 2 73 with bourgeois revolutionar ies. He illustrated his belief in \"the union and agreement\" of all \"democratic parties\" early in the Revolution of 1848 by dissolving the new Central Committee of the Communist League founded in Paris under his presidency. He argued that the es­ tablishment of full civil liberties in revolutionary Paris rendered such an association superflu ous. Disillusion ment with the democrat ic label was soon to develop ; but many believed in 1848 that communism was democracy in the social sphere. Like \"democracy\" in 1789-94, \"communism\" in 1848 became a major scare word-used \"to frighten political rabbits,\" and, as such, ap­ pealing to \"all frank democrats aware of the logic of their principl e. \" 225 Communism vs. Socialism In the course of the I 84os, the word communism acquired a meaning distinct from socialism. There was, to be sure, much confusion and overlappin g. Some, like Marx, used the terms interchangeably at times.226 Neverthele ss, the aggressive propag ation of the newer word by young French journalists in the early forties and the halo of martyr­ dom attached to the \"communist trials\" lent a special aura to the new term. Communism was generally distinguished from socialism in any or all of four ways. First, communism suggested more far-reaching social control than socialism-con trol over consumpt ion as well as production. At its first congress in June 1847, the Communist League advocated not just social­ izing the means of production, but also creating a far-reaching \"commu­ nity of goods\" for \"the distribution of all products according to general agreeme nt.\" 227 Communism was a new form of life shared in common, not merely a new form of social control.22 8 Second, communism was increasingly associated with a scientific and materialistic worldview in contrast to moralis tic and idealistic social­ ism. With an intensity that grew from Cabet to Dezamy to Marx, com­ munists saw the future order emerging out of the objective necessity of scientific truth rather than from any subjective appeal to moral ideals. Attachment to the communal ideal required detachment from everything else: a distaste bordering on revulsion for romant ic senti­ mentality (the degenerate form of moral idealism), and a militant opposition to belief in God (the ultimate source of moral idealism). 2 29 Third, communism was widely associated with political violence in a way that socialism seldom was. This identification was present from the very beginning. In 1840, when one of the original communists at­ tempted to assassinate the king, the trial linked communistes immedi­ ats to violent means.23 0 Lamennais argued in 1841 that communists unlike socialists had to realize \"rigorous and absolute equality\" and would therefore be forced \"under one form or another\" into . . . the use of force, despotism and dictatorship in order to esta blish and maintain it. 2 3 1"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"2 7 4 THE DOMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES George Sand noted that socialists, unlike communi sts, do not \"concern themselves enough perhaps with the present-day struggle .\" 2 3 2 Cabet, in tracing the history of communism in I842, admitted that its origins lay less in his own nonviolent utopianism than in the Babeuvist tra­ dition of \"immediate and violent\" revolution. 2 33 The communists' belief in the inevitability of an egalitarian order legitimized, if it did not lead to, violence. 2 34 Communists argued that bourgeois society was already doing violence to humanity. Precisely because the communists saw themselves building the final, violence­ free community, they felt justified in undertaking a final, revolutionary act of violence. In his original statement of the \"purposes of the Com­ munists\" in October I846, Engels declared that they would \"refuse to recognize any other means\" to establish communal ownership by the proletariat \"except violent, democratic revoluti on.\" 2 35 Victor Considerant, author of the socialist manifesto that rivalled Marx's, insisted that \"communism is before all else a negative idea .... Not knowing how to unravel the Gordian knot, it cuts it.\" 2 3 6 Russian socialists tended to agree. Herzen in I 844 defined commu­ nism as \"primarily negative, a storm-cloud charged with thunder bolts, which like the judgment of God will destroy our absurd social system unless men repent\" ; 2 3 7 and, a few years later as \"the socialism of revenge ... close to the soul of the French people, which has so profound a sense of the injustice of the social order and so little respect for human personality.\" 2 3 8 Within Russia, the Pocket Di ctionary of the Fourierist Petrashevsky circle listed communism in April I846 at the end of a series of opposition groups descended from \"the party of Milton\" in the English civil war reaching even beyond the \"radicals.\" 2 39 The suggest ion was made that the future society be divided between \"Fourier ists\" and \"communis ts,\" 2 4 0 who were said to differ by locating the source of evil, in competition and in private property, respec­ tively. 2 4 1 But the heart of the difference-in Petrashevsky's own words -lay in the fact that \"Fourierism leads gradually and naturally up to that which communism wants to institute forcibly and in an instant.\" 2 4 2 The fourth way in which communism generally differed from social­ ism by the late I 84os was in its reliance on the power and authority of the working class . Even Herzen, despite his fear of communism, called it in I844 \"closer to the masses.\" 2 43 From Homelessness to Universality The small band of intellectuals that moved the social revolutionary camp toward communism had one common characteristic : homeless­ ness. They generally owned \"neither castles nor cottages,\" 244 and, in the words of a French student of the rise of communism, comprised a \"species of proletarian that is described by the term Heimathlosen , that is to say, people without hearth or home.\" 2 45 Physical homeless­ ness was often deepened into spiritual alienation by three characte r­ istics shared by most of the original communis ts: youth, unrewarded intellectual precocity, and the loneliness of exile."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"The Early Church (the 18 4 os) 2 75 The most extreme communists were extremely young. The original communist banquet of I 840 had been organized largely by radicals in their late teens as a counter-banquet to the more genteel evenings of older electoral reformers . The systematic atheism with which Dezamy rejected Cabet (and Marx, Weitling) expressed the rebellion of the very young against men sometimes old enough to be their fathers. The ideological passion of Dezamy and Marx was also the channel of expression for intellectual talent and personal ambition that could find no adequate rewards in existing society. These men turned against the patriarchs of communism in the French and German worlds seeking to free the new ideal from the \"utopian\" mode of social experiment charact eristic of an earlier generation . But where could the young who rejected paternal and divine authority find a home of their own? Ultimately not in space, but in ti me; not in the places of geography, but in the flow of history. Historical ideology offered cosmic compens ation for the lack of a particular dwelling place. The social revolutiona ry became a pilgrim without a holy land, but with a wholly certain view of history. This vision flourished in lonely exile. The path to communism began with Buonarroti, an Italian exiled from Corsica to France to Switzer­ land to Belgium. Communist organization began among Germans exiled into non-German-spe aking regions : in French-speaking Switzerl and, France, Belgium, and finally England. Communism never took root inside Germany even during the turmoil of I848-49, nor among the large, German-speaking regions of Switzerland and the United States. Revolutionary communism also proved stronger among Frenchmen ex­ iled after I 848 to Jersey and London than it ever had been in Paris. The social revolutionaries who formed the Communist League in Lon­ don were young, uprooted, and largely denationa lized intellectuals. The core was Heimathlosen Germans surrounded by a miscellany of Flemish­ speaking Belgians, Anglicized Irishmen, multi-lingual Swiss and Scan­ dinavians. The twenty-nine-year-old Marx could become a senior statesman in such a group. He was the prototypical displaced intellectual : a Berlin Hegelian who had discovered French social thought in Paris and then digested English economics during a second exile in Belgium. The \"Communist Party\" for which he purported to be speaking in his Mani­ festo existed only in his prophetic imagination. This \"party\" was a kind of pied-a-terre for a few intellectuals cut off from the main currents of European politics on the eve of revolution. Marx provided no real navigational course for the storms that broke out early in I848 within a few weeks of publication of the Manife sto. But he did find a homing point for the compass : the coming classless society. The inexorable movement towards this end overrode and super­ seded all personal or parochial considerations. Man's proper home in the interim lay not in any castle on the sand, but in the stream of history itself. Faith in a coming \"universal\" liberation 246 reinforced Marx's faith in historical materialism.

His hopes focused on wester n Europ e, where bourgeois society and its redemptive pro­ letariat were most advance d; and he generally saw progressive sig­ nificance in the spread of European institutio ns : German above all-but French, English, and even Russian when at the expense of Asian bac kwardnes s. 2 47 Even amidst the pressing happenings in Cologne dur­ ing 1848-49, Marx's articles in Neue Rheinische Zeitung repeatedly found revolution ary relevance in remote events . On the Taiping rebel­ lion, he suggested in 1853 that . . . the Chinese revolution will throw the spark into the overloaded mine of the present industrial system and cause the explosion of the long­ prepared general crisis, which, spreading abro ad, will be closely followed by political revolutions on the Continent. 248 A few years later, a Spanish upheaval prompted him to conclude that \"the revolution is imminent and will take at once a socialist charac­ ter.\" 2 49 On the eve of his death, ass assinations in Russia inspired the thought that Russian events might serve as a \"signal to the revolu­ tionary development of the West\" 2 5 0 and thus to universal liberation. Marx's genius offered rootless revolutionaries anywhere a new kind of shelter-in nothing particular, but something universal. That some­ thing combined Hegelian historicism and Saint-Simonian scientism : in­ evit ability and perfectibility. Whereas other socialists and communists offered revolutionary ideas, Marx provided a revolution ary ideology. By developing it at a relat ively young age, Ma rx was able to stake a claim as strategis t-in-chief of proletarian revolution that he was able to sus­ tain for another forty years . His younger collaborator, Engels , contin­ ued that role for eleven more years after Marx died in 1883, beg inning an apostolic succession with an increasingly disputed lineage. Marx's special position was based largely on two factors that he emphasized for revolution ary thinking during the turmoil of 1848- so : the destiny of the proletariat and the necessity of dictatorship. The first of these elements was introduced by Marx on the eve of t he Revolu­ tion of 1848, the second in its afterm ath. Marx invested both concepts with the kind of universal significance that assured their continued appeal long after the memory faded of revolution ary events in which Marx played only an insignificant part. \"The Proletariat\" Once aga in a word was crucial. Much of the sudden rise to prom­ inence of the numerically insignificant communists can be traced to their ability to dramatize their own connection with something they were the first system atic ally to label \"the prolet ariat.\" There was, of course, something very tang ible behind the label. The"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"The Early Church (the 184os) 2 77 spread of industrial machinery and the factory system throughout west­ em Europe had created by the 184os a growing body of manual labor­ ers working for uncertain wages in new urban environ ments. The con­ ditions in mine and mill were often brutal; and the new industrial laborer had none of the pride of product and self-respect of traditional artisan s. He tended to become a subordinate statistic in the ledgers of investment and accounting, and shared similar experiences and griev­ ances with workers in other countries. Neverthel ess, there was little internal communic ation-let alone shared identity-among these workers. They tended to quarrel more among themselves than with anyone else-and to exacerbate rather than supplant all the older ethnic, religious, and national conflicts of humanity. The number of factory workers was still insignific ant out­ side of England, and their sense of collective importance was even smaller. Marx's distinctive accomplishment was to establish the idea widely that history was producing a single force of deliverance known as \"the proletariat\" with a single head (\"organ of consciousness\" ), the communist party. It is as important to trace the revolution ary intel­ lectuals' myth of \"the proletariat\" as it is to analyze the actual condi­ tions and concerns of working people in the industrial era.25 1 The term proletariat came into modern use in the seventeenth cen­ tury as a general , contemptuous term for the lower classes.2 52 More positive connot ations appeared in the eighteenth century through Rous­ seau and some Babeuvis ts.253 The word was identified with class con­ flict in Sismondi's influential New Principles of Political Economy of I8Ig. Sismondi's \"social economics\" challenged the classical econo­ mists' indifference to the social consequences of the free play of market forces, which had led not to incre ased happiness for the people, but rather to the impoverishment of \"the proletar iat.\" He argued that, whereas the Roman proletariat lived at the expense of the people, the modern bourgeoisie was living at the expense of the proletar iat. After the Revolution of 1830, some argued \"the need of special rep­ resentation for the proletarians\" in the assembly; 254 but an increasing number followed Blanqui in identifying \"the proletariat\" with social struggle outside all existing political arenas.255 Lamennais wrote that the common objective of both socialists and communists was \"to abol­ ish the proletariat and to liberate the proletar ian.\" 256 The reality of class conflict was affirmed in a host of new publica­ tions of the early 184os,257 and the need for active class struggle was intensified by the younger communists' battle against Cabet's pac­ ifistic communi sm. A defender of Babeuf launched an early attack on Cabet in August 1840, announcin g, \"Je ne suis pas litterateur, mais un pr oletaire .... \" 25 8 Per Gotrek, a Swedish printer who had person ally known Cabet, 259 brought some of the large Workers' Education Circle in Stockholm into the discussions of the London League with his pamphlet of 1847 stress­ ing the link between the pro l etariat and communi sm: On the Prole tariat"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"2 7 8 THE DoM INANCE oF THE NATIONAL REvoLUTIONARIES and its Liber ation by the Path of True Communism. 2 6 0 Victor Tedesco wrote Catechism of the Prole tarian , 26 1 which spoke of class conflict between \"the rich and the proletarian.\" 2 6 2 The European worker's con­ dition was like that of the black slave in Ameri ca: \"The negro is the slave of man. The proleta rian is the slave of capital.\" 2 6 3 Marx's conception of the proletariat may well have been influenced by Gotrek and Tedesco, who later worked respectively on the first Swedish and French translat ions of the Communist Manifesto. 2 64 Tedesco's influence was greater, since he was personally close both to Marx and to Wilhelm Wolff, the organizer of the German Workers' League, which was founded in Brussels in 1847. 2 6\" Wolff accompanied Engels to the first meeting of the Communist League in London in June 1847; and Tedesco accompanied Marx to the second meeting in Decem­ ber. Brussels radical circles had, if anything, even more class conscious­ ness than those in Paris.26H Marx was also influenced by Lorenz von Stein's Socialism and Communism in Cont emporary France, which had first popularized the communist ideal in Germany, by explaining that Communism, as the expression of proleta rian class consciousness, may sharpen the opposition and the hatred between the two large classes of society .... Communism is a natural and inevitable phenomenon in any nation which has developed from a ma rket society into an industrial society and which has given rise to a prolet ari at. There is no power in the world that can prevent the growth of Communi sm.2 6 7 Marx's theory of history and of dynamic class conflict was first set forth fully yet concisely in the Communist Manifesto, in January 1848. \"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class strug­ gles,\" 26 8 proclaimed the opening sentence of the first of its four sec­ tions, \"bourgeois and proletar ians.\" This arresting be ginning suggested not only a simple program -class struggle against the bourgeoisie -but at the same time a messia nic calling for the party that could deliver humanity from its bondage. \"The proletariat alone is a really revolu­ tionary class,\" 2 6 9 the chosen instrument of a class war to end class war. Only in part two, \"proletarians and communis ts,\" was the new type of party mentioned. It derives all its sanction (though not necessarily any of its members ) from the proleta riat. The new party was in no way separate from the proletariat or opposed to \"other working class par­ ties,\" but was the only group to represent \"the proletariat as a whole.\" 2 70 As such, the communist party has an obligation when par­ ticipating in any national movement to \"bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat, independent of all nationality. \" 271 After only a few pages of discussion, all mention of a communist party ended. Engels, at the time of writing the Manifesto, had written that \"communism is no doctrine, but a movem ent.\" 272 Although the Manifesto suggests a number of egalitarian measures to be undertaken after the seizure of power, these are to be undertaken not by a party, but by \"the proletariat\" itself, creating \"a vast association of the whole nation\" in which \"public power will lose its political character .\" All"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"The Early Church (the 18 4 os) 2 7 9 class antagonisms would vanish as men entered a new type of \"as­ sociation in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.\" 273 The third section of the Manifesto was a criticism of rival socialist theorie s, an excellent example of the denunciatory literature endemic among revolutionaries in the 184os. At the same time it was a virtuoso exercise in class analysis-relegating each school to its own form of historical oblivion by showing its \"feudal,\" \"bourgeois,\" or \"petit bour­ geois\" nature. Names were for the most part avoided; and positive recognition was extended- albeit somewhat patronizin gly-only to three \"utopian\" socialists : Saint-Simon , Fourier, and Owen. Their plans for the future allegedly awoke the critical imagination and corres­ ponded to \"the first instinctive yearnings\" of the proletariat \"for a gen­ eral reconstruction of society .\" 274 The final short section of the Manifesto prescribed a variety of tactical alliances for \"the communi sts.\" Marx insisted in the manner charac­ teristic of earlier revolutionaries that the violence of revolution would in reality only bring to a rational (and thus final) conclusion the vio­ lence and disruption already begun unconsciously and prolonged ir­ responsibly by the bourgeoisie. It was they who had disrupted the family, taken away private property from most of humanity, and re­ placed home education by social education. The communists sought only to champion a movement which, by completing these processes in a society free of class antagoni sms, would bring all this disruption to an end. Dictatorship Despite the ringing rhetoric of its final \"WORKERS OF THE WORLD, UNITE !\", the Manifesto was largely unnoticed until well after the revo­ lutions of 1848-49. As a document of its own time, it was inaccurate in its two major predictions for the immediate future: that national antag­ onisms were vanishing before a new transnational proletari at; and that the coming wave of revolution would focus on Germany and move from a bourgeois to a proletarian revolution. The Communist League, for which the Manifesto was written, also played only a minor role in the revolutionary events. After the return of its leaders to Germany in the spring of 1848, the membership of the London League was a scant eighty-fo ur; 275 and the membership else­ where was scattered and divided. Marx was mainly preoccupied with editing Neue Rheinische Zeitung from May 1848 until its demise the following May. He provided not so much practical revolutiona ry guidance as an Olympian overview of political and economic developments that often seemed far removed from his readers .27 6 \"The music in them,\" one worker wrote, \"is pitched too high for us; we cannot whistle it.\" 277 Bitterness grew with the repression in Germany and with the failure of the proletari an-bourgeois democratic alliance to stem the tide.

He helped reorganize it, and issued a first address to it in March I85o.279 But dissension soon tore it apart, and Marx's activities were increasingly concentrated on the refinement of his theory of revolution in two great works on recent events: Class Struggle in France (I 850) and Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (I852). These, together with the Communist Manifesto and the first sketch in I 849 of his theory of socio-economic develop­ ment (later expanded in Critique of Pol itical Economy and Capital), represented the heart of his vision and revolutionary legacy. His writings in London, beginning with his Manifesto for the recon­ stituted Communist League, stressed the transnational nature of the corning social revolution. His tone became almost eschatological in the continuation of Neue Rheinische Zeitung, which was written in London, printed in Hamburg, and distributed in America as well as Euro pe. He expected it soon to become a weekly and then a daily; 28 0 but only six numbers appeared between March and its demise in November I8so. His international perspect ive offered not only cosmic consolation, but also fresh hopes for revolution. The workers had been crushed in Paris only because \"everywhere in the continent\" the leadership of the bour­ geoisie had \"entered into open alliance with feudal monarchy against the people,\" while the working class formed no such international al­ liance. But the French repression also revealed the \"secret\" that any government now was forced \"to maintain external peace in order to conduct a civil war internally.\" Peoples just beginning their struggle for national independence were de­ livered over to the power of Russia, Austria, and Prussia. But at the same time the fate of these national revolutions was made dependent on the fate of the workers' revolution. Their seeming self-sufficiency and inde­ pendence from the great social upheaval had vanished. 281 Pointedly singling out the three most nationalistic revolution ary movements in Europe, he added: Neither Hungarian, nor Pole, nor Italian will be free as long as the worker remains a slave. 2s 2 The victory of the counter-revolution had created-by its own inter­ national character- conditions for the universal victory of revoluti on. His interpretation-in form if not in content-was strikingly like that of religious rnessianists who occasionally joined the revolutionaries of I 848, arguing that the triumph of the Antichrist announced the im­ minent Second Corning of Christ.

The revolution will begin only when world war places the proletariat at the head of the nation controlling the world market, at the head of England. 2 8 5 He hoped that conflict would develop between the temporarily trium­ phant bourgeoisies of France and England. This in turn would unify the French and English proletari at-and represent the \"organic beginning\" of the final revolution. The present generation is reminiscent of those Jews whom Moses led through the desert. It must not only conquer a new world, but also leave the scene in order to give way to a people ripe for the new world. 2 8G By the end of I 849 it had become clear that the German and French revolutions had failed to produce a new order (and the Chartist move­ ment had failed to produce even a serious uprising). But the cause of social revolution had at least acquired a banner of its own to match the myriad colors of the national revolutionari es. In Paris in 18 48 the red flag had replaced the black flag as the favored banner of the proletar iat. \"Only when steeped in the blood of the June insurgents,\" Marx wrote in 18 5o, \"did the tricolor become transformed into the flag of the Euro­ pean Revolution-the red flag.\" 2 8 7 At an international gathering of November 10 , I8 5o, Marx's friend the Chartist Julian Harney became the first man publicly to repudiate his own national banner in favor of the red flag of revolut ion.2 ss But the workers did not follow this banner. The revolution had col­ lapsed everywhere except among the orators in London, where a revolu­ tion had never taken place at all. It was a time of crisis for a com­ mitted ideological revolutionary. Marx had believed in a universal revoluti on, which was fading into universal failure. History manifestly refused to follow his manifesto. As a participant, Marx proved largely unable to communicate with workers, let alone lead them. The standard response to such disappointment was emigration to America for a new start. The flight of German revolutionaries to the New World after 18 48 represented one of the most massive movements of its kind in the century.2 8 9 Marx and Engels themselves briefly planned to emigrate to America in August 18 so. 2 9 0 But they rejected this al­ ternative along with the second one of substituting reformist for rev­ olutionary goals within Europe. Marx followed instead a third course character istic of a small number of Germans remaining in exile within Europe : the intensific ation of messianic commitment. Almost uniquely among the revolutionary ex­ tremis ts, however, Marx avoided acts of adventurism or fantasies of fresh conspiracy.

Incarcerating himself in the British Museum, he wid­ ened his strategic perspect ives with journalism and wrote his massive theoretical works: Critique of Political Economy, Grundrisse, and Das Kapital. The main immediate conclusion that Marx derived from the setbacks of 1848-49 was that there was need for a revolutionary dictatorship to act on behalf of the proletariat. In propounding this doctrine, he drew close to Blanqui, whose ideas would also provide fortification for Lenin at a later time. In April of 1850, Marx and Engels joined Harney and others in Lon­ don to draw up plans for the Universal League of Revolutionary Com­ munists-a short-lived last effort to transform the revived Communist League into a guiding force for secret revolution ary organizations throughout Europe. The statutes of this organization contained the first clear formulation of the concept of an interim \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" : The aim of the assoc iation is the overthrow of all the privileged classes, the subject ion of these classes to the dictatorship of the proletariat by sustain­ ing the revolution in permanence until the realization of Communism, which has to be the final form of the organization of human society. 29 1 Ma rx first related the term \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" to his theory of history and class struggle in March 1852. The Buonarrotian idea of a transitional elite dictator ship was thus transformed into its \"Marxist\" form of class dictatorship as the necessary preliminary to a classless society. 292 After 1848 many revolutionary leaders had discussed the need for some kind of dictatorship to defend revolutionary democracy from counter-revolution . The term \"dictator\" still had some of its ancient Roman connotations of tempor ary martial law in behalf of a repub­ lic 29 :3 -although Marx had also used it as a t erm of abuse. 2 94 The term did not yet have its modern despotic ring. German communists had also used the term approvin gly, beginning with Weitling in 1845: Should we call communism to the fore through revolutionary means, then we must have a dictator who governs over everything. 29 5 In Cologne during the 1848 revoluti on, Marx rebuked the assembly for failing to exercise dictatorship \"in the face of the daily growing threat of counter -revoluti on.\" 29 6 Every provisional state set up after a revolution requires a dictatorship, and an energetic dictatorship at that.297 A decade earlier, after the failure of the insurrection of 1839 and Blanqui's imprisonment in Mont-Saint-Michel, Blanquists had fled to London. Blanquist emigres now turned again to the question of \"what the people should demand the day after a revoluti on.\" 29 8 In 1848, as in I 839, they had seen insurrection crushed and the master imprisoned (in remote Belle-Ile in the Bay of Biscay)."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"------ ----· The Early Church (th_e 184os) Marx had already known (and may have been influenced by) Blanquists in Belgium, particularly Jacques Imbert who had served with Marx as co-vice-president of the Brussels Democrat ic Association.299 A large­ scale publication effort was planned, though never realized, by the Blanquists in London; and consideration was given to founding together with the London communists a new organizat ion on the model of the Central Republican Society, which Blanqui, Dezamy, and others had set up between the Februa ry Revolution and the June repression of 1848. Blanqui had argued then for (I) placing military and political power immedia tely and directly in the hands of the working class, and (2) post­ poning elections so that the interim organizations of the revolutionary proletariat would have time to reeducate the masses in terms of their true interests rather than outmoded political categories.3 00 In the context of forming a united revolution ary front with the Blan­ quists, Marx introduced the term \"dictatorship of the working class\" in place of his previous term \"rule [Herrschaft] of the proletariat\" in January I8so.3°1 Although Marx cited it as a \"brave slogan of the revolutionary struggle\" which had anonymously appeared in Paris in 1848,3 02 it seems probable that he had simply taken it from the Blan­ quists. He had been brought into close touch with the newly arrived followers of Blanqui at a dinner in London given by Harney and other radical Chartists late in 1849. The French Blanquists joined Engels, Marx, and Harney to provide leadership for the Universal League of Revolution ary Communists. The statutes (written in French by the most \"Blanquist\" of the Germans, August Willich, who was then specially close to Marx) proclaimed the aim of overthrowing the privileged classes and submitting them to . . . the dictatorship of the proletariat by maintaining the revolution in permanence until the realization of comm unism .s o s The final section of Marx's Class Warfare in Fra:nce, written at this very time, equates the \"revolutionary proletariat\" with \"the party of Blanqui.\" 3 0 4 All was not lost because The proletariat is more and more uniting around revolutionary socialism, around communism, which the bourgeoisie itself has baptised with the name Bl anqui.3 05 Marx's language becomes almost totally derivative in the use of char­ acteristic Blanquist terms of abuse (\"juggler\") and expressions of physical aversion for utopian \"reveries\" that distract from making revolu­ tion. The victory in the Paris election of March 1850 by Paul Louis De­ flotte, \"a friend of Blanqui's ... the June insurgent, the represent ative of the revolutionary proletariat,\" is cited by Marx as proletarian revenge for the massacres of June 1848. \"Behind the ballot papers lay the paving stones.\" 3 06 He then uses-for the first time-the phrase \"dic­ tatorship of the proletariat,\" linking it immediately with his other new t er m \"perm anent revolution . \" 3 07 The suggestion of Blanquist influence on Marx is anathema to later Marxists, who seem committed both to exaggerating Marx's originality"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"28 4 THE DoMINANcE oF THE NATIONAL REvOLUTIONARIEs and to caricaturing \"Blanquism.\" Even when not subject to Soviet dis­ cipline , Marxists insist that Marx did not take the term from Blanqui and used the term to contrast his \"class dictatorship\" with Blanqui's elitist conception.3° 8 Far fr om establishing a lack of Blanqui's influence, how­ ever, such usage only indicates a deeper linkage. Fo r Marx tended to denounce the ism behind an individual in the act of borrowing his idea-just as he reviled the persona of a rival leader he was seeking to displace. Adopting an idea from Blanqui created a compens atory need to denounce \"Blanquism. \" Blanqui's influence on Marx during this period is further illustrated by Marx's taking over of another term that was to become important in revolutionary history : permanent revolution . Marx had rejected such a concept when it was suggested by workin g-class leaders in Cologne during 18 48- 49; 3 09 but he embraced \"revolution in permanence \" as the \"war cry\" of the reorganized Communist League in March 18 50. 31 0 Marx saw permanent revolut ion as a necessa ry condition of any future \"dictatorship of the proleta riat\" if it was to be different in kind from the \"dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.\" The circulars sent from the London Central Committee to the Ger­ man members of the Communist League in March indicated that the classical Illuminist-Buon arrotian-Blanquist type of conspiracy had taken root among Germans. Emissaries from London were instructed to re· cruit people to the league from within existing revolutionary organi­ zations. There should be two classes of membership ; an outer circle of local and provincial groups that knew nothing about the inner circle; it alone was to be told of \"the communist consequences of the present movement.\" The secret, hierarchical movement was to be entirely ma­ nipulated by the London Central Committ ee, which would sanction selective terror against \"hated individuals or public buildings associ­ ated with hated memor ies.\" 311 The leadership suggested that the Com­ munist League should prepare Germans to fight even more against petty bourgeois democrats than against reactionaries in the next phase of revolutionary warfare . Following the defeat of the workers' insurrection in Paris in July 18 50, Marx decided that further revolution was unlikely ; and by August, he fell out with Willich, who fought a duel with one of Marx's followers early in September. In the course of rewriting the statutes of the Com­ munist League, Marx denounced Willich and his followers on September I 5 for relying on \"the will of revolutionaries as the sole motor of revolution\" 31 2 and flooding the movement with petty bourgeois ele­ ments so that \"the word 'proletariat' is now used as an empty word, as is the word 'people' by the democra ts.\" 31 3 But Marx's plans for reorganizing the league did not force a split with the \"Blanquist\" Will­ ich. Marx took the unusual steps of sanctioning two separate groups in London, while transferring the league's headqu arters to Cologne. Though smaller than ever in numbers, the German-based league gained a measure of new life late in 18 50 through its links with a much larger if nonrevolutionary national organization of workers : Stephen Born's brotherhood (Verbriiderung ). Marx was largely excluded from"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"The Early Church (the 184os) the league, but continued to be represented by many younger revolu­ tionaries . 3 1 4 Nor were links with the French Blanquists affected by Marx's es­ trangement from the Willich group in London. Marx and Engels trans­ lated into both German and English Blanqui's denunciation of moder­ ate socialists sent by him from prison to a Banquet of Equals held in London on February 24, 1851. Blanqui said, among other th ings, that in the future, All governments will be traitorous which, ha ving been lifted up on the shoulders of the proletariat, do not proceed immediately with (I ) general disarmament of bourgeois troops and ( 2) the armament and organization into nat ional militia of all the worke rs.315 The Communist League came to its end in May 1851. The movement which had begun with a German tailor (Weitling) bearing communist proposals to the League of the Just twelve years earlier ended when another German tailor (Peter Nothjung of the Cologne Central Com­ mittee) was arrested in a Leipzig railroad station on May I o carrying most of the important documents of the league.3 16 Engels's Revolut ion and Coun ter-Revolution in Germany of 1851-52 blamed the failure of the German revolution on the timidity of the bourgeois liberals who led it. But some share of the blame might also be allotted to the extremism of the communist program, which fright­ ened workers as well as bourgeois liberals and gave a pretext for re­ pression to reactionaries.3 1 7 The displaced journeymen who provided the rank and file for the German upheavals felt threatened by intel­ lectuals who sought to manipulate them with unfamiliar terminology. As was to be the case later-in Italy on the eve of Mussol ini and Ger­ many on the eve of Hitler- extremism on the Left played a role in preparing the way for reaction on the Right. Marx's own postmortem was concentrated on France. He had trans­ lated Blanqui's blunt aphorism \"Who has iron has bread\" for the Ban­ quet of Equals in February !851.31 8 But by the end of the year he realized that the established authorities had all the iron and could dispense the bread to the weary masses. Blanqui remained in prison; and the last great popular uprising of the era (of one hundred thou­ sand rebels against Napoleon III's proclam ation of dictatorship ) in De­ cember 1851, was crushed with five hundred killed and twenty thou­ sand convict ed.3 19 There was no major upheaval in France and no further mention of the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" anywhere until the Paris Commune twenty years later. s 2 o Marx sent his famous \"Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte\" to his close friend Joseph Weydemeyer in 1852 for publicat ion in his short-lived new weekly journal, Die Revolution.\" 32 1 \"Blanqui and his comrades\" were designated by Marx as \"the real leaders of the prole­ tarian party, the revolutionary commun ists.\" 322 (The last three words were excised in later editions after Marx be g an to view Blan q ui a s a rival rather than an ally.

The Blanquist belief in an unend­ ing revolutionary struggle provided hope in the face of the European reaction. Trotsky was to revive the concept of \"permanent revolution\" in a similar period of depression after the Russian Revolution of 1905.3 26 But most expressions of hope tended to come from the New World rather than the Old. Willich, Weydeme yer, and Weitling (for the second time) had emigrat ed; other pioneering social revolutionaries like Cabet and Harney soon followed; and Marx himself became a writer for the New York Tribune . Militantly atheist \"Communist Clubs\" were formed among German emigres in New York, Chicago, and Cincinnati during 1857-58.3 2 7 But for the most part, the early dream of social revolution in Europe was simply grafted onto the national dream of an expanding Americ a, while in Europe many of Marx's German associates became absorbed in the nationalist mystique of the German drive for unity; his old friend Moses Hess became a visionary Jewish nationalist. H2 H Marx, however , continued to believe in the inevita bility of a social revolution global in scope and permanent in nature. Looking back in 186o on his experiences with the Communist League, Marx would not seem overly distressed that a \"party in the altogether ephemeral sense of the word has not existed for eight years.\" For in his more lofty meaning of the word-\"By party, I understand party in the great his­ torical sense\" -such a party was only beginning to exist: The League, like the Society of Seasons in Paris, like hundreds of other societies, was only an episode in the history of the party, which is every­ where spontaneously growing on the soil of contemporary society.3 2 9 Thus, the confused and quarrelsome history of the Communist League was only an episode in the creation of a greater party to come, a \"party in the great historical sense.\" It seems appropriate that the only other \"episode\" Marx mentioned was Blanqui's Society of the Seasons. In arguing for a centralized revolution ary dictato rship in the name of a semimythologized, monolithic proletari at, Marx had moved close to the positions of Blanqui. This evolution in tum heightened the conflict which had already opened up among social revolutionaries between Marx and the passion ately anti-ide ological, anticentralizing Pierre-J oseph Proudhon ."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"CHAPT ER 10 Schism: Marx vs. Proudhon THE DEEPEST and most fundamental conflict among social revolu­ tionaries is that which recurs between intellectuals who propose to speak for working people and workers who attempt to use the language of intellectuals. Marx, the intellectual par excellence, had his two ear­ liest and bitterest quarrels with the two physical toilers who most effectively articulated the revolutionary cause of the working class in the 184os: Wilhelm Weitling and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. Weitling was in effect excommunicated by Marx during a personal confrontation at the latter's home in Brussels on March 30, 1846. A neutral witness recalls how Weitling attempted to discuss revolution­ ary strategy \"within the bounds of common-place liberal talk.\" Sud­ denly, Marx broke the polite euphor ia: Tell us, Weitling, you who ha ve made such a noise in Germany with your preachi ng : on what grounds do you ju stify your activity and what do you intend to base it on in the future? It is the classic voice of the intellectual, certain that he understands the interests of the working class as a whole, indifferent to the short­ sighted opinions of individual workers , contemptuous of leaders like Weitling who arouse the masses \"without any firm well-thought-out reasons for their activity. \" Weitling responded by touching Marx's raw­ est nerve: his lack of human links with the working class. Weitling consoled himself for the evening's attacks by remembering the hundreds of letters and declarations of gratitude that he had received from all parts of his native land and by the thought that his modest spad ework was perhaps of greater weight for the common cause than criticism and armchair analysis of doctrines far from the world of the suffering and afflicted people."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"288 THE DOMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES On hearing these last words Marx finally lost control of himself and thumped so ha rd with his fist on the table that the lamp on it rung and shook. He jumped up sayi ng : \"Ignorance never yet helped anybody !\" 1 Ma rx responded by asserting his intellectual superiority and pedagogic mission ; and the thumping of his fist did not stop until Weitling had been driven to America and friends like Moses Hess driven to tell Weitling that he would \"have nothing more to do with your party.\" 2 Marx followed this attack with a circular against Hermann Kriege, who had moved from collaboration with Marx in Belgium to editorship of an American journal with the Babeuvist title, Tribune of the People (V olks­ tribun ). Marx excoriated Kriege's mindless sentiment ality (pointing out that Kriege used the word \"love\" thirty-five times) and his belief that the social problem could be solved in land-rich America by \"turning all men into owners of private property.\" 3 Many years later, in the longest and last of his many major works denouncing rival radicals, Marx made it clear that the pamphlet against Kriege had in effect been part of a conscious ideological purge: We published at the same time a series of pamphlets, partly printed, partly lithographed, in which we subjected to a merciless criticism [the reigning ideas] of the League. We established in its place the scientific understand­ ing of the economic structure of bourgeois society as the only tenable theoretical foundation. We also explained in popular form that our task was not the fulfillment of some utopian system but the conscious participa­ tion in the historical process of social revolution that was taking place before our eyes.4 The field was clearer to impose his program on German emigres after Weitling went to Americ a early in 18 47 to aid Kriege and rescue his followers from their nationalistic deviation of the previous year: sup­ porting the war against Mexico. But Kriege's Tribune of the People soon died, and Marx vaulted past the distant Weitling into international leadership of the communist movement . Marx's conflict with Weitling revealed a characte ristic blend of con­ tempt for the man and respect for his role. Marx saw nothing personal in his attacks on Weitlin g. Indeed, Marx paid tribute to WeHling's pre­ vious function of launching a revolution ary social critique of the exist­ ing order. But Weitling by the mid-forties represented to Marx that most obstructive of anachron isms: a historical leader whose time had past. Weitling was unable to fulfill the historical position of egalitarian, proletarian leadership which he himself had created. In order to fill this position himself, Marx moved beyond the German-speaking world to mount a similar , simultaneous attack on Proudh on: the leading pro­ letarian revolutionary within the French citadel of the revolutionary faith. The clash that developed between Marx and Proudhon proved the most important among social revolutionaries in their time-and may remain the most relevant for our own. For two decades after their first falling out in 18 45, Marx and Prou­ dhon fought in bitter rivalry for leadership of the n ew proletar ian movement.

In the I86os (after the death of Proudhon ), Marx's daughters inveighed against Proudhonism even while dancing at the festivals of the First InternationaJ.5 In the Ig6os (after the \"death of ideology\" ), the heirs of Proudhon, in effect, answered back to the Marxists with the festivals of the \"new left.\" The Marx-Proudhon conflict can be analyzed on two quite different levels: as a person al-political clash between rival nineteent h-century revolutionarie s, and as a broader ideological conflict of divergent but enduring radical ideals. The Clash of Men The personal conflict between Marx and Proudhon was most intense dur­ ing its first phase just prior to the Revolution of 1848. But it was to continue until Proudhon's death in 1865; and an insulting obituary by Marx helped ensure that the clash would continue between rival groups. The battle between Marxists and Proudhonists was central to the discordant history of the First International from 1864 to 1876- and to the tensions that continued thereafter between Latin and Slavic revolutionaries on the one hand and German Social Democrats on the other. It was not so much a battle of ideas as a clash of the moralistic and the authoritarian temperaments over the question, should revolution­ aries have an ideology? Marx answered Yes-and became the enshrined authority for the more than a billion people who had come to live under communist rule by the mid-twentieth century. Proudhon's negative answer made him the ancestor (often unacknowl edged) of anarchis tic alternatives, which rarely succeeded but never quite disappeared. In 1844, during the critical turning point in his life, the twenty-five­ year-old Karl Marx first came to know the thirty-five-year-old Proudhon. The quarrels that soon developed between them aggravated almost every exposed nerve of the young Marx at a precarious time of transition from his youth as a philosopher to his maturity as a revolutionar y. Proudon seemed to challenge not just Marx's ideas, but his very identity. In the months just before his expulsion from Paris in February 1845, Marx was blending his personal struggle with philosophical alienation into a world historical theory in which proletarian revolution would overcome all human alienation . He was expecting his first child, but had not yet formed his firm collaboration with Engels or fully elab­ orated his new views. His break with the philosophical idealism of his former Hegelian friends was completed. But he had not yet established any concrete links with either the proletariat or the revolution-the objects of his faith. Youthful Germanic hopes for a \"holy alliance\""},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"2 9 0 THE DoMI NANCE oF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES with the French revolution ary tradition, which had brought Hess, Marx, and the others to Paris, had been rudely dispelled. The Deutsch­ Franzo sische ]ahrbucher of 18 44 had failed to attract a single French contributor. Marx, like other recent radical arrivals from Germany, had been ignored and occasionally ridiculed by leading French revolution­ aries. Thus Marx felt a deep need for a French connection as he entered into extended discussions with Proudhon soon after the latter arrived in Paris from Lyon on September 25, 18 44. Proudhon was the most arrest­ ing and famous radical personality in France: authentically plebeian and fearlessly polemic. Proudhon represented a link both with the revolutionary France that the Germans admired and with the proletariat that Marx personally professed to serve. As early as 18 42, Marx had praised Proudhon above other French socialists as a \"penetrating\" fig­ ure. Early in 18 44 Marx had sought to praise the workin g-class commu­ nism of Weitling by calling him \"even better than Proudhon.\" 6 Marx particula rly admired the power and simplicity of Proudhon's What is Propert y? of 18 41. Proudhon answered bluntly : \"Property is theft,\" and went on to suggest that the \"proletor\" would expropriate the proprietor and establish property rights equal for all. Marx admired Proudhon's forceful clarity in insisting on a social revolution along class lines. Throughout 18 44 Marx contrasted the Frenchman favorably with the abstract Germans. He called What is Property? a \"scientific mani­ festo of the French proletariat\" 7 which has the same importance for modern economics that Sieyes' What is the Third Estate? has for modern politi cs. s This was high praise, even when softened by a patronizing tone. Proudhon had begun to explore precisely those problems that were most central to Marx's own new outlook : the economic basis and class nature of revolutionary conflict. Proudhon had contended that even if the proprietor paid his workers the full day's wage they had com­ manded before moving into a factory, he would still not be paying them for the \"collective force\" that produced new wealth out of \"the union and harmony of the workers , the convergence and simulta neity of their effor ts.\" 9 Marx praised this analysis in The Holy Family ; and what Proudhon called the \"error in counting\" (the disparity be­ tween the sum of the workers' wages and the value of the goods pro­ duc ed) may have been the starting point for the Marxist theory of sur­ plus value. Marx seemed to draw from Proudhon in the first instance the idea that the basic form of capitalist exploitation was the appropria­ tion of work not paid for by the owner: the \"surplus value\" accumulated after paying the worker the lowest wage that the market would per­ mit. 10 But whereas Proudhon invoked Ricardo's theory that labor was the source of all value as a moral imperative for achieving equality in the future, Marx alluded to it as a scientific tool for analyzing exploi­ tation in the present .11 In his Philosophical Manuscr ipts of 18 44, Marx had begun to see future liberation in the overcoming of the \"alienation\""},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Schism: Marx vs. Proudhon of the worker (\"living labor\") from the means of production which were owned by the capitalist (\"dead labor\"). Two essays of 18 44 began to suggest that the proletariat might be the historical force for over­ coming this alienation and liberating all of humanity from this ex­ ploitation. l2 By the time of the Communist Manifesto, Marx had thor­ oughly distilled the view that \"the bourgeoisie ... produces ... its own gravediggers\" and that its overthrow by the proletariat was to come about through historical inevitability and not Proudhonian exhortation. Proudhon made little mention of Marx in his early writings. But Marx later claimed to have given him a philosophical education; and there may be traces of a brief infatuation with the new Marxist perspec­ tive in Proudhon's rather uncharac teristic expression from a letter late in 18 44 : One must abandon the subject ive point of departure so far adopted by philosophers and legislators and seek outside of the vague conception of the just and good the laws which can serve to determine it ... object ively in the study of the social relations created by economic facts.13 The fatal break between the two men came in 18 46 after Marx had gathered together his thoughts and a nucleus of German followers in Belgium. It was a two-staged split affecting first the organiz ation and then the ideology of the revolutionary movemen t-with a deep per­ sonal and cultural animus underlying both. The organizational break came as a result of a lette r from Marx of May 5, 18 46, asking Proudhon to become the French correspondent of a new international revolutionar y organization . The letter spoke of com­ mittees of correspondence, but cautioned of a need for extreme se­ crecy and contained a peculiar postscript added by the Belgian Phi­ lippe Gigot, whom Marx had designated as his cosigner of letters from the Brussels center. Gigot denounced as a \"charlatan\" and \"parasi te\" the German radical Karl Gri.in, who had arrived in Paris just as Marx was leaving. Karl Gri.in was resented by Marx as someone who, in effect, had taken his place. For Gri.in was the latest self-appointed ambassador of German philosophy to Parisian revolutionar ies, the author of a new book de­ fining the nature and meaning of current revolutionary ferment, 1 4 and a rival courtier for the favor of Proudhon. \"Proudhon is the only Frenchman completely free of prejudices that I have ever known,\" Gri.in had written. 1 5 Proudhon reciprocated the admirat ion, and ad­ dressed a sharp response directly to Marx, whom he apparently as­ sumed to be the true author of the entire letter. Proudhon went far beyond the questions raised in the letter to sug­ gest deep doubts about Marx himself. Proudhon expressed willingness to work together to discover the laws of society, but feared that Mar x had not yet risen above the German penchant for \"a priori dogmatism\" : Let us not fall into the contradiction of your compatriot Luther who having overthrown catholic theology, immediately turned to his own ex­ communications and anathemas, to found a protestant theology. lG"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"2 9 2 THE DoMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REvoLUTIONARIES Thus, Proudhon feared the authoritarianism in Marx even when he himself was being offered a major share of the authority. Because we are at the head of a movement, let us not make ourselves the chiefs of a new intolerance, let us not pose as the apostles of a new re­ ligion, even if it should be the religion of logic and reason .l7 Such sentiments were clearly threatening to the much younger Marx, who felt immune from religion, and newly inspired by economic dogma. But Proudhon went still further to challenge Marx's new-found faith in sudden-even violent-social change. Proudhon characterized this as a \"shove\" ( secouss e) rather than a true revolution : I prefer to ha ve proprietorship (p ropriete ) burned over a slow flame rather than to give it new force by making a Saint-B artholomew of prop­ erty owners ... our proletarians have such a great thirst for science that one who gave them nothing to drink except blood would not be welcome among them. l s Proudhon charact erized Marx's faith in violent revolution somewhat patronizingly as a phase that he, Proudhon, had also gone through in his younger years. He defended Grun in human terms as a father faced with abject poverty who had continued the education in German thought that Marx had helped begin. In a somewhat provocative con­ clusion, Proudhon asserted his own authority as the more experienc ed, older figure, and suggested that Marx and his associates help promote the German translation of Proudhon's forthcoming book that Grun was preparing . 1 9 The work to which Proudhon referred was his massive System of Economic Cont radictions or Philosophy of Poverty of October 1846. In direct response, Marx wrote The Poverty of Philosophy, which he fin­ ished in June I 84 7: � o the only book-length treatise against a single man and the only work in French that Marx ever wrote. 21 It was given a key role in spreading the \"new teaching\" that Marx succeeded in making the ideological underpinning of the Communist League by the end of 1847. His personal conflict with Proudhon thus became part of an organiza­ tional struggle for the allegiance of social revolutionaries. The Marx­ Engels collaboration was sealed and their earliest organizational ef­ forts conducted against this background of polemics with Proudh on. At critical stages of Marx's subsequent revolutionary career, moreover, Marx would again be confronted by rival prophecies from the abrasive Frenchman. Marx's interpretation of 1848, for instance, seemed chal­ lenged by Proudhon's General Idea of the Revolu tion of 185I, which de­ nounced the perversion of the revolutionary ideal into \"materialist cen­ tralization .\" 22 Proudhon's La Revolution demontree par le coup d'etat du 2 decembre of July 1852 was a deliberate counter-interpretation to Marx's famous \"Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte,\" filled with maddeningly para doxical judgments which even included an appeal to Napoleon III to become the champion of social reform . 2 3 Marx contem­ plated (and may have written) a critique of Proudhon's General Idea; �� and Engels composed an attack on Proudhon at the time, which was"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"Schism: Marx vs. Proudhon 2 93 long unpublish ed. 2 5 Marxists have repeatedly echoed the master in ac­ cusing Proudhon of courting, if not in effect urging, collaboration with Napoleon II J . 26 Later, when Marx finally saw ideology and organizati on coming to­ gether into the First International in 1864, Proudhon produced a final series of writings that both conflicted in theory with Marx's Critique of Political Economy and helped prevent in practice French workers from collaborating harmoniously with Germans. Proudhon subst ituted talk of justice for economic analysis; direct moral appeals to \"the working classes\" for the ideological politics of \"the proletariat.\" Proudhon's death on January 19, 1865, was all but celebrated by Marx in an obituary for the January edition of the German journal Sozial­ demokrat, which has been subse quen tly used as a ritual preface or appendix to Marxist editions of The Poverty of Philosophy. Marx re­ peated his earlier negative judgment in a letter to a leading German Social Democrat: He wants to soar as the man of science above the bourgeois and the proletarians; he is merely the petty bourgeois, continually tossed back and forth between capital and labor, political economy and communism .27 Followers of Proudhon The ghost of Proudhon lived on to haunt Marx for at least the remain­ der of the nineteenth century. Proudhonist opposit ion to centralism and ideological dogma dominated both the First International and the Paris Commune of 1871-the two most important phenomena in the development of the social revolutionary tradition in the West during the remaining years of Marx's life. The organizational-political aspect of the Marx-Proudhon conflict be­ gan while Proudhon was still alive-with the first attempts to organize international proletarian cooperation after the disast rous failures of 1848-51. Proudhon emerged from these years with much the greater reputation -ea rned as an active journalist in Paris who had consisten tly called for radical, immediate social change and as one of the very few newly elected members of the assembly who used his positi on to pro­ test publicly the June mass acres of 1848. As far afield as quiescent Denmark, there was an immediate response to Proudhon's vision of a new internationalism based on mutual aid and small-sca le cooperatives rather than on national units and par­ liamentary politi cs. A remarkable young medical student, Frederik Dreier, in his Future of the Peoples of the World in 1848 set forth the vision of an international of small-scale cooperatives speaking a new common language. He founded a small artisan organization largely in­ spired by the ideas of Proudhon. 2 8 Thus, the first approximation of the cooperative movement i n northern Europe, which later became a major contribution of Scandinavia to modern socialism, was Proudhonist in inspiration. But Dreier died in 1853 at the age of twenty-fi ve, and the movement never had the chance to develop.

A tall, handsome graduate of West Point and Harvard Divinity School, William Greene of Mass achusetts, published in I 850 a Proudhon­ ist book, Mutual Banking, and proceeded to set up a system of land banks to promote mutual ism in the New World. In 1853, he moved to Paris, where he met Proudhon and remained until the Civil War. After a brief tour of duty in the Union Army, he became a labor organizer, dividing his time between America and France, where he joined the French section of the First Intern ation al.29 The beginnings of an international work ing-class movement can be traced to April 1856, when a predominately Proudhonist deleg ation of French workers arrived in London with an \"Address from the work­ ers of France to their brothe rs, the workers of England.\" It proposed a League of Workers of All Nations to supplant capitalism everywhere with Proudhonist producer and consumer cooperative s.3o Then , in 1862, Napoleon III conceded to his restless working class the right to elect a delegat ion to the London International Exhibit of 1862. This was the first independent political activity of French workers since the Na­ poleonic coup ; and the 750 delegates spread international political awareness among the French prolet ariat. The most influential prole­ tarian leader was a pure Proudhoni st, Henri-Louis Tolain , who inde­ pendently arranged for a second workin g-class delegat ion to London in 1863. Its meet ings proved more milita nt, featuring speeches in sup­ port of the Polish Revolu tion and establishing links with the newly founded London Trades Council.31 A call was issued for an international gathering the following year-w hich proved to be the founding meeting of the First International. Marx prevailed over the Mazzinians within the central committee in the drafting of the general rules and the inaugural address for the new organization late in 1864. Marx's fear of the Proudhonists was evi­ denced in his successful insistence on subs tituting a London meeting of the central committee (General Council ) for its first congress, which had been scheduled for Belgium in September 1865. But conflict with the Proudhonists flared into the open at the conference and continued to dominate the first four congresses which were held on an annual basis in Switzerland or Belgium (Geneva, Lausanne, Brussels, Basel). The underlying issue was almost always the same : the insistence of the Proudhonists on a workin g-class movement based on trade unions and cooperatives that would avoid becoming involved in political or ideological quest ions. The French initially tried to limit membership in the International to manual worke rs, for they had a deep distrust of the rhetoricians and savants who had so long misled the Parisian workers with political slogans. Proudhon had written an influential pamphlet in April 1863 urging true democrats to boycott the polls (\"the political church of the bour­ geoisie\" ) in the elections scheduled for May.32 The same antipolitical tone pervaded both the Manifesto of the 6o of Febru ary 1864, whose signatories included only workers , and Proudhon's own posthumously published On the Political Capacity of the Working C l asses.aa At the congresses of the International in the late sixties , the French consis-"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"Schism: Marx vs. Proudhon 2 95 tently opposed general resolutions on remote and largely symbolic in­ ternational issues (Poland ) or measures of reform that depended on enforcement by the power of the state (child labor laws ).34 To Marx, however, such issues were not ends in themselv es, but useful \"guerrilla fights\" 35 for mobilizing proletarian consciousness and solid arity in the struggle against capitalism. Though not present at any of the early congr esses, Marx exercised increasing control through his position on the General Council and his energet ic talent as drafter and tactician . The Brussels Congress of 1868, which attracted a record one hundred delegates, committed the International to the policy of nationalizing the means of production -lar gely by wooing some of the swollen Belgian deleg ation away from the Proudhonist French position. Cesar de Paepe, leader of the Belgian section which hosted and dominated the congress, described his movement into alliance with the Marxist position as being \"de-Proudhoniz ed.\" 36 The congress at Basel in the following year con­ firmed the decline of Proudhonist influence by endorsing the common ownersh ip of land, which the Proudhonists considered equivalent to \"collective tyranny.\" 37 The relatively nonviolent Proudhonists were, in effect, supplanted within the International by the more militant and revolutionary form of anarchism represented by Bakunin, who for the first time attended a congress at the International in 186g. But during the Franco-Prussian War and the subsequent civil war fought within France against the Paris Commune, it was the Proudhonists (including Proudhon's friend and portraitist, Cour bet) who completely dominated the Paris federation of the International. They provided seventeen of the nine ty-two elected representatives of the Commune. After the war and revolution of 1870-7 I, the nonviolent antistat ism of Proudhon reasse rted its appeal to a new and chastened generation of social revolutionar ies. Proudhonism gained a new following in agrarian southern and eastern Europe. Seminal propagandists of populism like Nicholas Mikhailovsky in Russia and Svetozar Markovic in Serbia trans­ lated Proudhon's works; s s and Proudhon's ideas inspired Pi y Marga!, leader of the antinationalist Federal Party in Spain, and others from Portugal to Mexico.39 In western Europe, Proudhonism remained a dominant current throughout the 187os and I88os. Prior to the great industrial expan­ sion of the I 8gos and the concurrent growth of the Second Interna­ tional, the \"petty bourgeois\" Proudhonist ideal of gaining immediate recompense in goods or property had continuing appe al. In a time of political repression, many preferred to develop workin g-class institu­ tions apart from bourgeois politics altogether. Outside of Germ any, Marxism responded effectively to Proudhonism and its ideological allies only after forming the first Marxist journal in France (Jules Guesde's Egalite of 1877), and the first Marxist circle among the Slavs (Plekhanov's \"Liberation of Labor\" in 1882).

The first was a militant gathering that far outshone the pallid Marxist congress a week later; the latter congress of r88g was, however, as the name Possibilists suggests, only an atten­ uated version of the Proudhonist message : a reformist search for the possible . The main group of Possibilists was overshadowed by the larger and more cosmopolitan gathering of Marxists, whose rival cen­ tennial commemoration of the French Revolution led to the founding of the Second International. A splinter group of the Possi bilists, however, led by the militant Jean Allem ane, who was like Proudhon a pr inter, kept alive the quas i­ anarchistic Proudhonist legacy as well as the emphasis on direct action by workers themselv es: \"No white hands; only hands with callouses!\" 4 0 More militant than the Pos sibilists, but deeply opposed to the dog­ matism and centr alism of the Marxists, the Allemanists helped transmit the heritage of Proudhon to the new revolutionary syndicalists as they formed in the early r8gos. The basic unit for this movement was the local version of a trade union, the Bourse de Travail, which was deeply Proudhonist in its working-cl ass composition and emphasis on local authority and direct action. If the future belonged to the better orga­ nized Marxists, who soon gained control of the Second International, the rival Proudhonists seemed still to dominate the militant workers' movement in France and most of the Latin world. As a leading German Social Democrat of the period explained: Every time that the workers' movement finds itself thrown back on itself, far from bourgeois temptations, far also from the advice of its own chiefs­ those who proclaim themselves their chiefs-it naturally recovers Proud­ honism, this Monroe Doctrine of the Proletar iat.41 Although anarcho-syndicalism continued to flourish in the Latin world at least through the Spanish Civil War, Proudhonism is generally seen as a transitory phenomenon of the period that preceded large-scale in­ dustrial and imperial expansion in the r8gos. The First International and the successor congresses of the r87os and r88os involved only a small fraction of the European working class. Rela tively skilled work­ ers from larger cities cont aining a variety of industries were in the fore­ front. There was little involvement of the unskilled masses from the new metallurgical and mining industries or from the newer factory cities built around one controlling industry .4 2 If the old artisan class was in decline, the new factory proletariat had not yet fully emerged. As late as r8g6, 534,000 of 575,000 industrial establishments in France had less than ten workers .43 The expansion of heavy industry, larger fac­ tories, and unskilled labor prepared the way for new mass movements more receptive to chauvinist appeals from the Right and Marxist direction on the Left. There seemed new relevance to Marx's critique of Proudhon as \"petty bourgeois\" ; but in a time of little-understood change, Proudhon's \" p et t y bourgeois\" ideal of preserving a meas ure of private property and local autonomy had continuing appeal."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Schism: Marx vs. Proudhon 2 97 Enduring Issues Beyond the personal passion of Marx and Proudhon and the political polemic s of their followers lay a deeper conflict about ideas that is of continuing import ance to those in search of radical social change. At first glance, the intensity of the Marx-Proudhon struggle seems surpr ising. Conservatives, liberals, and earlier romantic socialists all saw many similarities between the two. Taken together, Marx and Proudhon represented the point of transiti on-indeed, of no return -from the sen­ timental theorizin g of the pre-1848 period to the no-nonsense toughness of modem mass revolutionary movements. Both had a confident vision of history that attached central impor­ tance to fulfilling the aborted hopes of the French revolutions of 1789 and 1848. This faith actually grew stronger in the wake of 1848, since both men absorbed themselves in fortifyin g their basic faith with long theoretical writings during the disillusioning aftermath of the defeated revolution. Both believed that social revolution could resolve the social and economic contr adictions in the real world. They were the first important continental revolutionaries to study English classica l economics at great length (even before I 848), and to view the working class as the chosen instrument of the ultimate liberat ion of all mankind. Both believed that all preceding socialisms were utopian and, in Prou­ dhon's phrase, reveries fantastiques: private experiments rather than suitable vehicles for the total transform ation of society. Both rejected the traditional institutions of bourgeois liberalism more systematically than their predecessors, and were deeply opposed to nationalism and the ideal of national liberat ion (though each reflected some national prejudices from his own backgrou nd). Both were creat ures of the new feuilleton style of writing in the early 184os and of the concurrent moves from philos ophy to polemic s, history to polit ics, academic dialogue to radical action groups. Yet the differences between Marx and Proudhon -and between their conscious followers and unconscious heirs-were profound. Conflict raged in at least six areas : philosophical, historic al, moral, politic al, economic, and religio us. Each of these domains became a battlefield for the continuing struggle between \"authoritarian\" communists and \"petty bourgeois\" mutu alists in the nineteenth century . Some or all of them have recurred in the continuing twentieth-century debate between col­ lectivist and libertarian impulses on the Left. (a) Philosophically, there was a difference from the first time the two men met in 1844. The young Marx was an authentic product of the in­ tellectual self-confidence of the University of Berlin : believing that all questions were answerable , and all problems soluble in an absolute sys­ tem of truth that he was in the act of discovering.

(b) Their different views of history were evidenced in the contras ting uses they made of Hegel's thought. Broadly stated, Marx turned Hegel upside down, making his theory materialistic rather than idealistic; but he maintained the basic Hegelian view that reality was monistic and that history was moving necess arily and dialectic ally toward the realization of an ideal future order. In contrast, Proudhon left Hegel right side up, maintaining the Hegelian image of history as a process of ideas unfolding through contradictio ns. But he denied the objective, monistic view of reality, substituting the dualism between \"ought\" and \"is\" of the subjective moralist. He further denied that there was any necessary \"synthesis\" to the contradictions of social life. Proudhon's definition of revolution was the \"defatalization\" of history rather than the final resolution of its problems.4 6 Proudhon's first major work, The System of Economic Contradiction s, insisted that the intellect could discover necessary contradictions in society-but no certain synthe ses. To Marx, this was \"the poverty of philosophy\" : a confession of philosophical bankruptcy that would dis­ arm revolutionaries by taking away any rational hope for the course of history. Proudhon's imperfect understanding of Hegel was easily dem­ onstrated by the young Marx, who explained that Proudhon \"glorifies contr adiction because contradiction is the basis of his existence .\" 47 (c) Proudhon's view of history was rooted in a moral philosophy closer to the stern moralism of Kant than to the impersonal historicism of Hegel. Marx called him \"the French Kant \"; and Kant helped lead Proudhon to speak not of a progressive dialectic which resolves every­ thing, but of antinomies that can never be resolv ed.48 Proudhon found in the Kantian discovery of insoluble philosophic al antinomies a source not of despair, as Marx contend ed, but of guidance for understanding the comparable antinomies in social life. The economic analysis of his System of Contradictions found paradox built into the very develop­ ment of an economy : the need for more poverty to create greater wealth; the pursuit of happiness leading to greater unhappine ss, and so forth. But Proudhon insisted that the agony of contradiction would not lead to despair or resignation as long as man did not look on the situation with complacency or cynic ism. The real answer for society was not the mythic conclusion of some future, final synthesis; but the realistic possibility that at every stage the contradictions which are part and parcel of life itself could be held in equilibrium. Proudhon spoke of a"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Schism: Marx vs. Proudhon 2 99 dynamic ever-changing equilibrium: an \"equilibration\" between forces that would never either vanish or lose their venality. The balancing of such rival forces, though always tense and precarious, was the highest good that man can hope for on earth. In society, contradictions are brought into equilibrium by Justice, which was for Proudhon a moral absolute. Justice was a higher princi­ ple that somehow struggled to control the historical proce ss. Good and evil were not relativized and subordinated to historical necessity as in Hegel, but kept as transcendent values in themselve s. He insisted on rejecting any scheme in which the distinc tion between good and evil was not fundamental. Marx noted that Proudhon had reduced Hegel's dialectic to \"the dogmatic distinction between good and bad.\" 49 History for Proudhon was a kind of development of the idea of Jus­ tice, which he described variously as \"the great ideal,\" \"a mystery,\" and \"the very essence of humanity .\" 5 0 This justice was the unending de­ fense of human dignity realized through the moral struggle of the in­ dividual conscience. Evil lay not in socia l relationship s, but in the hu­ man will; and therefore the proletarian cause would not in itself save humanity as Marx contended .5 1 Proudhon called Marx utopia n for be­ lieving that society could be improved \"without stirring up renewed consciousness of justice.\" 52 Marx for his part considered Proudhon utopian for making mankind dependent on the moral idealism of the individ ual, and the workings of an unhistor ical, meta physical concep­ tion of justice. (d) Politicall y, Proudhon's attitude differed sharply from that of Marx-although both believed that the coming revolution would ulti­ mately bring an end to any oppressive rule of man over man. Marx's economic determinism argued that the revolution would be accom­ plished by the proleta rian conquest of political power; and that this pro­ cess would require a new type of politica l party and an interim \"dicta­ torship of the prolet ariat.\" Proudhon, believing in moral determinism , argued that the revolution could be realized only through concrete so­ cial and economic change ; and that this process required a reject ion of all political activity in favor of immediate social changes producing tan­ gible economic benefits. During the Revolution of 1848 Proudhon eschewed political debates, insisting that a parliamentary division is \"Iooo times more idiotic\" than the ceremony of annointment with holy oil.53 He concentrated instead on mounting a direct attack on what he called \"industrial feudalism\" : the abuse of property owners hip to accumulate unearned profits and enserf workers with \"the leprosy of inter est.\" He proposed a system of people's banks to grant virtually free credit. This would stimulate eco­ nomic activity without increasing the power of the government or of large, impersonal business enterpris es. Marx rightly pointed out that this was a petit bourgeois concepti on; for Proudhon sought not to end the ownership of property, but only to end ownershi p without labor-profit without work. He sought to realize equality by \"an identity of the labor and capita list\" that would not deny the acquisitive instinct in man, but rather would make capital immedi-"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"3 00 THE DoMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REvoLUTIONARIES ately available to all, and thus would achieve an equilibrium between liberty and order. 54 (e) Economically, the essence of their argument was that Marx be­ lieved property should be aboli shed, while Proudhon believed it should be distri buted. In the Hegelian language of their polemic s, Marx de­ fined communism-whose essence was the liquidation of private prop­ erty-as the final synthesis of history. Proudhon saw communism only as an \"antithesis\" of capitalism-and thus necess arily as one-sided and false as the \"thesis\" of capita lism itsel£.55 Proudhon's new revolution sociale was to be made not by the violent seizure of political power at the center, but rather by the nonviolent development of a new system of equal contracts at the local level. Direct agreement of man to man was to undermine and replace that artificial contract between citizen and governm ent, between worker and capita l­ ist. Free credit was to stimulate the moral goal of a fairer distribution rather than the economic goal of greater production. Proudhon in the 18sos and 186os moved beyond the simple anarchism of his early works 56 and related his vision of the coming social revolu­ tion to two new concep ts: mutualism and federalism. The word mutual­ ism he took from long prior usage among the artisans of Lyon. It was, thus, one of the few isms with an authentic origin among workers rather than intellec tuals. On June 28, 1828, workers in Lyon organized a so­ ciety of Devoir Mutuel or Mutuellisme, with a program of educat ion and mutual aid designed above all to further the self-sufficiency and self-respect of the silk weavers in the city. The date came to be annually celebrated as \"year __ of the regeneration\" ; 57 and in the subsequent uprising of November 1831, a more militant Association des Mutuel­ listes also briefly played a role. The workers of Lyon generally pre­ ferred to call themselves mutuellistes rather than proletaires during the turbulent years leading up to the Revolution of 1848; and the term connoted workers organizing themselves in militant pursuit of their own immediate needs and material inter ests. This mutua list tradition of Lyon was never dominated either by in­ tellectua ls or by republican politic ians. The prou d, provincial bastion of Lyon was suspicious of either intellectual or political centralization , which inevitab ly meant Parisian dominance. The strong artisan tradi­ tions of the silk industry made Lyonnais workers addition ally hostile to the centralization and monopolizat ion of economic power. Proudhon's native Besanc;on was far closer geogr aphic ally and spiritually to Lyon than to Paris. Proudhon spent much of the crucial period from 1843-47, when he was writing his most important works , in Lyon. He took the Lyonnais label and applied it to his own ideal of a new type of free contractual relationship among individual artisans in a common enterprise.\"8 Proudhon's mutua lism represented a social revo­ lutionary ideal much in the air in the mid-nineteenth century but largely forgotten in the twentieth because it was opposed to commu­ nism. In like manner, Proudhon's political ideal of federalism was widely admired in the mid-nin eteenth century,\"n but has been obscured since by the dominant, rival concept of nationalism."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Schism: Marx vs. Proudhon 3 01 Federalism was \"mutualism transported to the politic al sphere,\" the politic al principle which could alone check the \"materialist centraliza­ tion\" of the modern national state. 6 ° Federalism was Proudhon's reluc­ tant concession to the need for politic al organization: the only hope he saw for avoiding nationalist ic wars and for preserving the equilibrium between order and freedom . So deep was Proudhon's commitment to the federal principle that he opposed most of the fashionable interna­ tional revolutionary causes of the r86os: the unification of Italy, the independence of Poland, the Union side in the American Civil War. He contended in each case that misguided politicians w ere simply creating larger and more impersonal concentrations of power with the aid of dece ptive political slogans. 6 1 Of Mazzini, Proudhon asked : Does he know what he has done for the Italian pleb in making him a fanatic for unity? He has established the reign of the bourgeoisie over him.6 2 Proudhon had a consistent-m any have called it reactionary -prefer­ ence for smaller and more personalized social units. His passionate defense of the traditional rural family (and attendant hatred of the \"pornocracy\" of Paris) w as part of a relentless localism that tended to prefer Burgundy to France, Franche Comte to Burgundy, and the in­ dividual family and village to Franche Comte. 63 Marx attacked this attitude as \"Proudhonized Stirnerism: everything to be dissolved into little groups or communes ... while history comes to a stop.\" 6 4 Marx's global perspect ive favored \"the establishment of la rge-scale economies and polities and the assimilation of smaller cul­ tures and languag es.\" 65 Marx and Engels had a special contempt for \"small relics of people ... got up in popular dress,\" and a certain in­ fatuat ion with \"the right of the great European nations to separate and independent existence .\" 66 Thus, he generally favored the struggles of larger, more advanced nations to become states (Italy, Hungar y), sup­ ported smaller struggles that might aid larger ones (Ireland-England ), and praised \"national classes\" whose interests spearheaded the strug­ gle of a nation with a special historical destiny (the bourgeoisie in Germany I 848-49 ). Against the Proudhonist argument that the Polish cause was a \"Bonapartist invention\" to divert working people from real social issues , Marx insisted in the First International that the Poles deserved continuing international support both because Poland was a great \"historical\" nation and because its nationhood was prerequisite to a German revolution. In his hostility to all forms of centralized power, Proudhon attacked Rousseau with particular venom for having made political tyranny \"re­ spectable by making it proceed from the people.\" 67 Proudhon saw more deeply than most other radicals into the dangers of war that were in­ herent in the very creation of the modern industrial state. War was be­ ing made likely not just by the monopoly of physical power and ideo­ logical au t ho r i ty invested in the state-but also because sta nda rds of behavior had ceased being moral and were becoming aesthetic . Abstra ct slogans and remote border conflicts had become matters of psychic sig-"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"3 02 THE DoMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONAIUES nificance to the uprooted masses who were increasingly seeking artistic genius in their leaders. 6 � Marx occasionally advocated war (usually against Russia ), but viewed it as a means of hastening social revolution and thus as a passing phe­ nomenon. Proudhon feared that war had an enduring psychological ap­ peal and suggested its inevitability in a world of sovereign nations : \"War is the most ancient of religions and it will be the last.\" G n In his view political conflicts tended necess arily to become wars. Since conflict could not be eliminated from human life, the ending of war required the elimination of politics. By concentrating on social rather than political causes , France now had the opportunity to redirect the attention of humanity into an area in which \"the jurisdiction of war is incompetent\" and thus \"create a new spiritual order.\" 7o The \"crea tive valor of war\" would not be denied or suppressed but rather \"trans­ posed\"' into creative labor in which the \"warrior virtues\" of individual pride and team effort were equally engaged.7 1 The creator of this new order-which Proudhon called in his late works a \"third world,\" a \"new democracy\" -was to be the \"working classes\" of France. In his final, posthumously published On the Politi­ cal Capacity of the Working Classes, Proudhon urged the development of a new ethos of \"democratic simplicity\" within the working classes : the nonviolent building of an egalitarian social order by mutu alism at the local level and boycotts against the bourgeois order at the national level. (f) Religion was a final area of difference between Proudhon and Marx; they had radically differing attitudes towards the Judae o-Chris­ tian heritage . Marx was a confident philosophical atheist. Though well versed in scripture as a youth, he showed almost no interest in it as an adult. His hero was Prometheus, who took fire away from the gods; and his perspec tive was patronizing if not contemptuous towards both his Jewish heritage and the Christian tradition of Germany into which he had been baptized. Religion he viewed as the opium of the people n and the confusion of the intel lectuals. Proudhon, on the other hand , was deeply and permanently disturbed by Christian teachin gs. He was not at all a believer in any conventional sense. But his writings were saturated with religious symbols and scrip­ tural passages. He descr ibed the dominant influences on his life as the Bible first, then Adam Smith and Hegel. The last two he shared with Marx; but the first was distinctive to Proudhon. In many ways he was probably a more thorough reader of the religious than of the economic or the philosophical text, since he read both Latin and Hebrew but never mastered the English of Smith or the German of Hegel. He had become acqu ainted with the Bible as a young typesetter for religious texts in his local communi ty,n and made an early contrast between the biblical idea of justice and compassion and the societ y of comfort, callousness, and complacency all around him. He developed a special revulsion for \"neo-Christian\" sentimentality-\"those fools who ad­ mire Christianity because it has produced bells and cathedrals\" -and a"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Schism: Marx vs. Proudhon 3 0 3 lifelong hatred for \"religion offering itself as a safeguard to the middle class.\" 74 For Marx, this use of religion by the ruling class was natural and in­ evitab le; a superstructure of religious rationalization that was bound to perish with the revolutionary destruction of the substructure of bour­ geois social forms. But Proudhon was deeply disturbed by any identifi­ ca tion of Christianity with the bourgeois order of Louis Philippe or Napoleon III. He became a passionate spokesman for the current in French social thought that sought to separate Christ from the Chur ch: to equate social radicalism with true Christianity. Proudhon hated the Saint-Simonian conception of a \"New Christianity,\" the belief that the people need a new religion to reconcile them to a new scient ific elite. Proudhon did not seek any new religion, but rather the final victory of Justice on earth, which he increasingly came to identify with the realizat ion of Christ's teachin gs. Christ to Proudhon was the starting point of Revolution and the supreme teacher of Justice-and thus the man who validated both of Proudhon's key concepts.75 He believed with Tolstoy that \"only that revolution which is impossible to stop is a fruit­ ful revolution\" ; 76 and that Christ had started it. 77 Although best known for his influence on French socialists and for­ eign an archis ts, Proudhon also influenced many unorthodox religious prophets of radical but nonviolent social change. Tolstoy took the title for his greatest novel, War and Peace, and some of his subsequent anarchist ideas from Proudhon . 78 Martin Buber saw Proudhon's mu­ tual ism as part of the moral inspiration for the Israeli kibbutzim , which constituted in turn a rival approach to social ownership to that of Soviet collectiviz ation .79 Radical \"personalists\" and worker-prie sts in France after World War II also found inspirat ion in Proudhon . His substantial foreign following was greatest in those countries that combined powerful religious traditions with react ionary and authoritarian social structures. Although Proudhon's influence has been most fully traced in the Latin world, it was probably most important in Russia. The unique traditions of Russian populism were deeply influenced by Proudhon from the beginning through his formative personal impact on Herzen and Bakunin, the two principal pioneering authors of its ideology. Russian populism developed in the years just after Proudhon's death in 1865 into a near perfect embodiment of Proudhonist ideas. The glorifi ca­ tion of a nonviolent social revolution through the commune and artel was antipolitical mutualism at its best. The anti-ideo logical, quasi­ Christ ian, and anti-authoritarian populist ideology also shared Prou­ dhon's fear of the cities, of central gover nment, and of the entire lexi­ con of liberal constitution alism . Like the Proudhonist socialists in late nineteenth-century France, the Russian populists divided into a mod­ erate \"possibilist\" wing (the \"legal popul ists\") and a more violent \"anarcho-syndicalist\" wing 8 0 (the terrorists in the People's Will orga­ nization and later in the Socialist Revolutionary party ). The Russians' passion for ultimate answers led them to develop Proudhon's antisystemat ic moralism into a heroic phi l osophy of action ."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"3 0 4 THE DOMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES Closest to an ideological expression of this attitu de, which underlay most of Russian populism, was Nicholas Mikhailovsky's \"subject ive method.\" It insisted that \"man with his flesh and blood, his thoughts and feelings\" must be both the means and the end of the revolutionary struggle . Lichnost', the fullness of person ality in every man and woman, could never \"be forgotten for an abstract category\" ; and the heroic, of­ ten anarchistic belief that they were waging a \"struggle for individual­ ity\" kept the Russian populists' belief in \"the people\" from becoming a mask for collectiv ism. 81 An aristocratic convert to revolutionary pop­ ulism in the late I86os, Peter Kropotkin, provided an eloquent new voice for Proudhonianism. After living among the watchmakers of the Jura, observing their disciplined mutualism , and talking at length with the predominately Proudhonist exiles from the Paris Commune, Kropot­ kin returned to St. Petersburg to help set up the first group to organize and politically educate urban workers in Russia, the so-called Chaikov­ sky circle, where much of the broader agitation of the 187os origin ated. Kropotkin amplified Proudhon's ideals by subst ituting the moral im­ perat ive of \"mutual aid\" for \"scientific\" theories of conflic t; and he drew up in late I 873 a kind of populist manifesto that repudiated all forms of constitutionalism in favor of a federat ion of independent local communities controlled by the workers and peasants themselv es.8 2 Conc urrently in the West, Bakunin was developing from the Proudhon­ ist tradition an even more militant form of revolutionary anarchism. Bakunin's resultant struggle with Marx was, as we shall see, in many ways a continuation of the earlier Proudhon-M arx conflict. But Russia in the twentieth century (like Germany in the late nineteen th) was to follow Marx rather than Proudhon. For Marx had analyzed the Indus­ trial Revolution more fully, and accepted the medium of political strug­ gle more naturally. Although few workers ever read his writin gs, in the late nineteenth century Marx's claim to scientific authority exer­ cised increasing appeal to the first generation ever to experience near universal primary educ ation in secular state schools. Marx's unfinished masterpiece of the post- 1848 period Capital was impenetrable for the average worker. He nevertheless felt ... a superstitious respect for that which he does not understand. There were two conditions: that it explain both the suffering he endures and the end it propo ses. Proudhon never knew how to satisfy either condition .H3 Yet despite Proudhon's inherent flaws and the seeming triumph of Marxism in the twentieth century, the ghost of Proudhon has not been entirely laid to rest. For the \"new left\" of the Ig6os bore many striking resemblances to the old Proudhonism. There was, first of all, the intense moralism and quasi-anar chic rejection of almost all established authority. There was the accomp anying Proudhonian desire to put power directly in the hands of \"the people,\" primarily by the nonviolent strengthening of local communal struc tures. At the same time there was a deep antag onism to dogma and \"idea-mania\" 84 as well as an indif­ ference to history,�5 and sus p i cio n of science. They followed Proudhon in protesting against remote central power, and arguing for immediate"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Schism: Marx vs. Proudhon concrete benefits against the distant, symbolic goals promoted by gov­ ernments . 86 They even revived (albeit unconsciou sly) the mystical term \"third world.\" The \"third world\" of the new left was the nonwhite, extra-European world oppressed by both capitalism and communi sm. But this new \"third world\"-l ike the old-was believed to be the bearer of a new social order because of its very lack of participation in the existing processes of power. Marxist hagiog raphers in the U.S.S. R., meanwhile, detected the hand of \"neo-Proudhonism\" behind a bewilder­ ing variety of anti-authoritarian impuls es; and denounced at great length the \"return to Proudhoni sm.\" 8 7 The original Marx-Proudhon controversy took place in the bleak period of European social ism : the third quarter of the nineteenth century. Early utopian experiments had faile d; the revolutions of 1848-so had been crushed; and the mass movements of the late nineteenth century had not yet been coalesced. The industrial bourgeoisie and the great state-builders -Ca vour and Napoleon III, Bism arck and Disraeli­ seemed everywhere trium phant. Yet both Marx and Proudhon continued to believe that bourgeois society was doom ed; and both reaffirmed in the darkest period of all-the 185os and 186os-t heir belief in a com­ ing social revolution . Marx based his revolutionary faith on an all-encompassing system of truth ; Proudhon offered in the last analysis only an impassioned belief in Justic e. Perhaps there is an analogy with thirteenth-century Europ e, when the outward prosperity of medieval civilization was at its height, but when two new mendicant orders appeared to preach prophetically of its inner weakness : the Dominic ans and the Franci scans . Marx was the modern Dominican, the system-building Thomas Aquinas of the revolutionary chur ch; Proudhon was its St. Francis . The former spoke primarily to the intellect, the latter mainly to the emotio ns. The Fran­ ciscans were always further from power and closer to heresy; but it was the Dominicans who lit the fires of the Inquisition and of Savonar ola."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II The Magic Medium: Journalism \"THE PRESS is a drum which leads to the frontier,\" wrote Armand Marrast, editor of the newspaper National during the upheavals of 1848 in Paris. 1 The frontiers were physical as well as spiritu al, for just as journ alism moved men to revolution, so journalists often manned the movements that resulted. Marrast, who as a young man had helped write the libretto for Rossini's William Tell, had moved on to the drum­ beat of journalism and became the mayor of revolutionary Paris. The last king of France was deposed literally as well as figurat ively by journal ists. Emile Girardin, the founder of the first cheap mass paper in Paris, La Presse, went to Louis Philippe and told him to get off of his throne late in the morning of February 24, 1848. 2 At that very moment , the new provisional government was being formed in the office of an­ other newsp aper (Flacon's radical La Reforme) after consultation with the editorial staff of a third (Marrast's Le National).3 Sweeping freedom for the press was among the provisional govern­ ment's first decrees . The profusion of revolutionary printing could not be contained in regular journals. It soon spilled out into posters, fly leafs, and placards, which Barmby likened to \"pulses of intellectual movement which we count by the minute\" -a count er-volley against \"the murder­ ous musk etry of a dead and driving despotism.\" This unprecedented out­ pouring represented \"handwriting on the wall to the Belshazzars of the earth !\" 4 at a time when \"printers must become princ es.\" 5 Whether it was cause or effect, barometer or spark plug, the press played a role that was as central in the revolution of young intellectuals in 1848 as had been the Maso nic-type conspiracy in the revolutions of young officers during 1815-25. A decade of florid journ alistic criticism set the stage for 1848. But the link between journalism and the modern"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"The Magic Medium: Journalism revolutionary tradition goes back much further and may even validate the hypothesis that \"every revolutionary change in the means of com­ munication is followed by a change in the entire structure of society.\" 6 The extraordin ary importance of journalism to the French Revolut ion has already been stressed. Whether at the mass level of mobilizing men and popular izing ideas a la Marat or Hebert or at the elite level of inventing new words and forms a la Bonnev ille or Restif, journalists provided the drumfire driving Frenchmen on to new concepts as well as to new conquests. The impact of the \"fourth estate\" during 1789-94 is all the more re­ markable for having occurred in a largely pre-indus trial era. Indus trial­ ization vastly increased both the number and importance of journali sts; and a large number of revolutionaries developed an almost physiological attachment to printing along with a personal dependence on journalistic writing. The hum of printing machines and the smell of printers' ink were close to the revolutionary movement at every critical moment during its pro­ gression from conspiracy to ideology. Restif is the prototype- inventing the word communist and fantasizing about \"the year 2ooo \" during the French Revolution in private communion with his own horne printing press-designing his own type face and typography, rejoicing in the physical act of printing and in the company of fellow printers. In like manner, Joseph Applegath, the first man to use the word socialist in its modern sense, was an engineer and \"creator of the printing presses from which the mode rn machines were derived.\" 7 Typographic tech­ nicians from the Ecole Polytechnique played a major role in the Saint­ Sirnonian movement. Henry Hetherin gton, the pioneer of the cheap, unstarnped radical press and a key early organizer of English Chartisrn , had been the apprentice of Luke Hansard, the famed parliamentary printer. His life was spent quite literally around printing press es; and court orders to suppress his activities were often accompanied by the physical destruction of press and type with blacksmiths' harnrners .s The spread of Owenite doctrines to the working class was largely the work of Hetherington and other printers such as George Mudie from Scotland. H Hetherington was also instrumental in launching the jour­ nalistic activities of Barrnby, who in turn repopula rized the word corn­ rnuni st.l o Schapper, the founder of the League of the Just, had been a student of forestry and was interested in the production of paper and print as well as of radical ideas. Proudhon learned to read while work­ ing as a printer's apprentice. Apprenticeship in the printshop induced a visceral sense of identification with the working classes in the songs of Beranger 11 as well as in the pamphlets of Proudhon. Compositors played a key role in the formation of revolution ary cir­ cles among German emigres in the late 183os. The German community in Paris had become increasingly revolutionary long before Marx joined their ranks in 1843· A Paris police report traced the leading role of the society of \"German demagogues\" and its subordinate \"action society\"­ both founded in 1838. Two of the three leaders of the former group were identified as printers (a Rauchfuss from Prussia via Swiss secret"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"3 08 THE DOMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES societies, and the \"clever and influential demagogue,\" Trappe of Dresden). The individual leader of the \"action society\" was a \"worker printer\" from Hanover named Rust, who under a variety of pseudo­ nyms had fled from Gottingen in 1830 to Belgium, Switzerl and, and the international revolutionary campaign against Savoy before coming to Paris in 183 7 . !2 From this pioneering group Weitling and Becker drew the talent and precedent for the original communist publicat ion campaign of the early forties in Switzer land.13 Particularly after hopes of revolution were dashed by the failure of the insurrection of 1839 in Paris, the German \"action society\" turned its activities in Belgium and Luxembourg en­ tirely to printing and propaganda.14 Journalism was the most important single professional activity for revolutionary Saint-Simonians and Hegel ians. Hegel as a young theology student had directly subst ituted the reading of English newspapers for morning prayers -a distant anticipation of the modern educated man subst ituting the Sunday newspaper for Sunday church. The Saint­ Simonians regarded the press as the medium for propagating the theol­ ogy of their new religion of humanity (just as the theater was t o provide its new liturgy) .15 The profession of revolutionary journa lism blended most closely with new means of communicat ion in Brussels of the 1840s. Marx's years of crucial ideological development climaxing in the Communist Manifesto were spent in Brussels, precisely when he was perfecting his mature profession as a journa list. Brussels had become a center both of legal revolutionary journ alism and of rapid indus trial development after the success ful Belgian Revolu­ tion of 1830. Buon arroti published his history of the Babeuf Conspiracy in Brussels, reminding his associates there that Babeuf had founded Journal de la Liberte de la Presse before his Tribun du Peuple. Buonar­ roti's Belgian followers like Jacob Kats, Louis de Potter, and Felix Dei­ hasse directed their activist impulses largely into journ alism,1 6 and in­ toxication with the new medium increased as Brussels became the hub of rail and telegraphic links between France, Engla nd, and North Germany. The remarkable Belgian social theorist Napoleon Barthel ar­ gued that these new media of communication hailed the advent of a \"scientific religion of humanity,\" which he called \"normalism.\" Versed in the occult study of phrenology and magnetism, Barthel moved from a Philosophic Manifesto of 1839 on to his strange outpouring of the revo­ lutionary year I 848 : On physical telegraphy in general, and in particu­ lar on the electromagnetic telegraphic system of Napoleon Barthel.17 The marriage of the printing press to telegraphy and a mass audience in the late forties fascinated the restless and uprooted emigres like Marx. The very titles of journals to which the German radicals con­ tributed suggested the mobilization of words to technology : the liberal Leipzig, Locomot ive, the socialist Westphiilische Dampfboot (Steam­ boat), and Gutzkow's Hamburg daily Telegraph filr Deutschland.

Their first organizational use of the label communist was for the Correspondence Committee, which apparently sought to infiltrate the correspondence networks and wire agencies centered in Brussels in order to place material in a wide spectrum of European journals. This Correspondence Committee apparently had links with a leftist news agency, the Brussels Correspondence Bureau, which Marx's close collaborator , Sebast ian Seiler, had helped found in 1844. 2 0 A radical Swiss journa list and former collaborator with Marx on the Rheinische Zeitung, Seiler employed Mar x 's brother -in-law Edgar von West phalen in his bureau. Brussels was the ideal base of operation s. Relatively free from censorship, it was the point of convergence for the three great wire services that were revolutionizing journalism : Reuters of Britain, Havas of Fran ce, and Wolff of Germany. Their lines were to meet in Brussels ; and Marx and Seiler were waiting. Not only the early hopes, but also the seminal quarrels of the revolu­ tionary movement developed in the shadow of the printing press . Schapper was Marx's proofreader on Neue Rheinische Zeitung; Stephen Born was his typesetter on Deutsche Brusseler Zeitung . Marx rejected the \"true socialism\" of the Young Hegelians and the quasi -religious com­ munism of Weitling by attacking their respective journals: the West­ phiilische Dampfboot and Volkstribun .2 1 Thus, emigre journ alism preceded and helped shape Marx's ideas on revolutionary organization. A similar sequence was to rec ur with Lenin , whose organizational ideas were largel y worked out in the activities of his journal Iskra in 1900-02, before a distinct Bolshevik party emerged in 1903. Both German Communism and Russian Bolshevism were founded by emigres largely immersed in journali sm, meeting in the same two cities of Brussels and London a half century apart. To understand the origins of the ideological journalism that played such a central role in the German and Russian movem ents, one must begin with the prior history of revolutionary journalism in France. In this as in so many other areas, Germany and Russia in the second half of the nineteenth century were keeping alive hopes that had been previously raised and then frustrated in France. The French Awakening The rise of revolutionary hopes in France was closely linked with changes in communic ations.

The results were as explosive for European politics as was the simultaneous first fusion of nitrogen and glycerin into the new raw material dynamite. The almost simultaneous discovery of practical methods for machine producing paper and for accelerating printing with steam power pro­ duced by the 182os the first major changes in printing in two cen­ turies.22 The resulting advent of modern mass journalism produced changes in thought no less far reaching than those produced earlier by the introduction of a phonetic alphabet and of a printing press (the \"chirographic\" and the \"typog raphic\" revolutions ).23 The role that Luther, the Gu tenberg press, and the vernacular Bible had played in the six­ teenth century was, in many ways, played by Walters of the Times and Girardin of La Presse at the beginning of the nineteenth. It seems appropriate that the word magazine-used already in the eighteenth century for thick weekly and monthly journals of criticism -was used to describe concentrations both of explosive powder and of polemic print.2 4 The unstamped working-class press of the 183os was, in the words of one French observer, \"simply a machine of war\" ; 25 and the flowering of a cheap daily press after the repeal of the tax deepened the passion for conflict. There may have been a special critical bias to the printed culture of Fra nce, for it took shape more under the influence of Rabelais and Montaigne than of a vernacular Bible . As a French journal­ ist-revolutionary in the 184os put it: Study of the French press reveals a characteri stic of its own that is emi­ nently distinctive : by the very fact that it exists, it is revolutionary ... the great successes, those which are revived from century to century, belong only to the revolutionary write rs. 2 o The powerful role of the press during the French Revolution made sub­ sequent rulers of France fear another Marat or Hebert. Res trictions on the press grew, and were systemat ically imposed by Napoleon. \"If I loosen my bridle on the press, I shall not stay in power for three months,\" he explai ned.27 Of the seventy-odd journals with political con­ tent published in the Paris region in 18oo, only four remained in exis­ tence (all under restrictio ns) by I8II.28 Napoleon viewed the English press as one of his major foes, and made intensive efforts to counter it, to influence it, and even to buy it off.29 His own semi-official Moniteur did little to arouse public support. Indeed, \"Napoleon may have made more enemies with this unfortunate journal than with his cannon. \" 3 0 During his brief restor ation after Elba in 1815, Napoleon raised expec­ tations of a free press -as did the Charter of 1815 after Napoleon's final depositi on.

After he was tried and sentenced to Mont-S aint­ Michel for publishing a new journal in I8I6, he wrote in prison an eight-volume Martyrology of the French Revolution or Monumental Col­ lection dedicated to the memory of the victims by their families. When released in I8I8, he was placed under police surveillance for twenty years, and moved away from revolutionary circles. But in the late twentie s, he renewed associat ion with Buonarroti, his \"tender friend\" 32 and his father's biographer, thus providing a thin thread of continuity between the revolution ary journalists in the I7gos and those in the I830S. During the restoration, Napoleon's Journal de l'Empire reassumed its earlier title Journal des Debats; and energy was transferred from the battlefield of empire to that of journalism by the \"youth of IBIS \" : ... with the collapse of the imperial system, when their arms fell with ex­ haustion, their intellects rose up to satisfy their need for activity. Works of the spirit succeeded fatigues of the body.33 Journals sprang up for all factions within the assembly- extending to the far fringes of Right and Left. The react ionary royalist \"ultras\" who boycotted the new assembly found journalistic voices as did radical republicans too inflammat ory for the assembly and thinly disguised par­ tisans of a Napoleonic restoration. Whatever their position, journals were partisan political organs with no separation of news and editorial functi ons. Only a few centrists around Guizot had anything approach­ ing a commitment to freedom of expression and ideological diversity for its own sake; and such moderates were ridiculed as \"doctr inaires.\" French journalistic polemic found particularly rich echoes among the Poles, who fortified old phrases through ritual repetition and added a halo of martyred heroism .34 Restrictions and censorship began in cen­ tral Europe with the Carlsbad Decrees of I8Ig, which were followed in France by the institution of a preliminary censor ship in 1820. A con­ tinuing alteration of fortune on a generally descending curve of freedom ended in efforts by Charles X to suspend freedom of the press alto­ gether on the eve of the Revolution of 1830. The revolutionaries of 1830 in both France and Belgium looked for­ ward to ... the day when every citizen shall be able to have a press in his home, just as he has the right to have pen and pape r.35 Among the many new journals, some began to argue for social as well as political change. Broad new vistas were suggested by the very titles of the two most important journals : The Future and The Globe.

The Globe had previously been the special organ of romanticism with a staff ... young and free of all attachment to the past ... a new generation ... smitten with liberty, eager for glory, above all young. With the naive faith of youth, generous illusions, limitle ss hope, they flattered themselves that they could avoid the pitfalls of their fathers and seize the conquests of the revolution while repudiating its crim es.37 In October 1830, after a number of his liberal collaborators on the journal had accepted positions in the government of Louis Philippe, Leroux transformed The Globe into a conscious Saint-Simonian organ, which became central to the \"evolution of French romanticism toward socialism .\" 38 Dedic ation to social change was stressed in the solemn pronouncement : \"The publication of the Globe is not a specul ation : it is the work of an apostolate.\" 39 The journal announced that it would be distributed free to the new Saint-Simonian churches springing up throughout France, and it was disseminated in theaters , gardens, and so forth . The Globe vaulted from printings of two thousand five hundred in September 1831 to four thousand two hundred in January 1832.4 0 Its provincial correspondents were to recruit adherents as well as to produce an inward flow of news and an outward dis tribution of propaganda.4 1 Leroux soon broke with the Saint-Simonia ns, but only to propagate even more aggressively their basic idea of using the media of com­ munications for social propaganda. He became a kind of lexicographer­ in-chief of the revolutionary Left-through his Revue Encyclopedique (f rom 1831 ), Nouvelle Encyclopedie (from 1834), his Revue Indepen­ dante (which he co-edited with George Sand in 1841 and effectively turned over to Louis Blanc in I 842), and his Revue Sociale (from 18 43). He was the first to popula rize the word socialism , largely as a term of abuse for the Saint-Simonians (\"who would transform human­ ity into a machine\" ), and the term individualism (an even worse En­ glish heresy \"which, in the name of liberty, turns men into rapacious wolves\" ).42 He gave a new religious intensity to the word humanity 43 and coined the word solidarity 44 for the social doctrine that he hoped would unify it. He himself fell victim to the dynamic of denunciation by labels. Having denounced the Saint-Simonians for building a \"new papacy\" with their mot talismanique of socialism in the 183os, he was accused of the same tendency in the 1840s by the rising critical star Sainte-Beuve, who said of his Revue Independante that \"the end is com­ munism and Leroux is its pope.\" 45 Leroux had an almost totemistic fascination with the new medium. His attachment to the printing press might almost be called Oedipal.

Utopian expectations of the press anticipated great expectations that developed for society itself. Across the Atlantic , Josiah Warren of Cincinnati concurrently sought to propagate a revolutionary message in America through a totally new typographical format involving a high-speed press, type moulds and facings, stereotype plates and cylindrical printers. A veteran of Owen's New Harmony, Warren was perhaps the first to popula rize the word so­ cialist in the New World. He eventua lly defined his unique blend of pacifistic anarchism as universology-arguing that political forms of rule were now irrelevant, that \"public influence is the real government of the world,\" and that printing should hencef orth be the main arm of \"this governing power.\" 47 Whereas Warren was opposed to \"the forming of societies or any other artificial combination,\" 48 Leroux sought some new principle of human association. In the same 1833, when Warren wrote The Peaceful Revo­ lutionist, Leroux's brother Jules addressed an appeal \"to typographi­ cal workers\" on the \"necessity of founding an associ ation aimed at mak­ ing workers owners of the instruments of labor.\" 49 Pierre Leroux's last major journal was the product of a printing associ ation he esta b­ lished in a small town in the Massif Central, purporting to provide a \"temple\" for humanity and a \"peaceful solution of the problem of the proletari at.\" 5o Louis Philippe's ministers saw a free press as the \"universal dissol­ vant\" 5 1 and staged more than four hundred press trials during 1831- 32.52 The example of England was seen as a further danger; for the philosophical radicals used the press to create pressure for the broad­ ening of suffrage in the Reform Bill of 1832.53 An official French en­ quiry on the press in 1833 noted with alarm the power of the new medium : A book is cold and slow like a protracted monologue before an absent spec­ tator. In a journal on the contrary the consequence follows the action. This idea which you hurl onto paper will make a tour of all of France tomor­ row . . . It forms secret links between the journalist and unknown friends that it has never seen and never will, but for whom its thinking is vital food . .. 54 Fearing that this \"food\" was creating its own appetite, the French gov­ ernment enacted restrictive press laws in September 1835. The real challenge to the radical press came, however, less from gov­ ernment restrictions than from bourgeois distracti ons. In 1836, Paris revolutionized journalism by creating two newspapers that were sold at half the previous price and were designed less to instruct than to divert.

The daily press was now pledged \"to study well the general taste and consta ntly to satisfy its changing require­ ments ( ses mobiles exigences) . \" 55 Girardin sought to provide \"public­ ity of facts and not polemic of ideas.\" 56 He and Dutacq developed the already established tradition of sensat ionalist canar d s - jou rn alistic fic­ tions that had begun in 1784 with the \"discove ry\" in Chile of a mon­ strous harpie fifteen feet high and twenty-two feet long, and been encouraged by Louis XVIII.57 Also important were the romans­ feuilletons, which reached the public through the new medium, be­ ginning with Alexander Dumas's smashingly succes sful The Three Mus­ keteers in Le Siecle. The new mass dailies moved \"beyond ideology,\" subst ituting enter­ tainmen t for politi cs, creating literary heroes in the absence of real political ones. In the decade following 1836, the reader ship of dailies in Paris incre ased from 70,ooo to 2oo,ooo.5 s Journalism became a sub­ stitute for both politics and education in a society where access to the assembly and to the universities incre ased hardly at all during the same perio d. As one Frenchman noted in I 838: \"In a country where there is more liberty than education, the press attempts to determine (and not just repeat ) what everyone thinks.\" 59 He saw the mass press building a \"new democracy\" by providing a tribunal for the people that was \"higher than the tribunal of judges, the throne of kings, and, I shall say, even the altar of the living God.\" 6o The Power of Pictures Pictures became a favorite weapon of the new radical journalism for the first time in November 1830, when the lithographed cartoons of the twenty-two-ye ar-old Honore Daumier began to appear in the new weekly La Caricature . The word caricature came from the Italian cari­ care: to load a weapon, and there was more than a little explosive power in the new pictorial press. Men in the mass could often be reached through pictures more easily than through words: through the common denominator of emotion rather than the uncommon quality of reason. The turn to visual effects, to \"journ alism made flesh,\" 6 1 helped move journalism even more deeply into social critic ism. The French Revolu­ tion had been enshrined in the imaginat ion essentially as a series of tableaux : the tennis court oath, the storming of the Bastille , and the endless processions to the guillotine or the battlefield. Napoleon had combined royal theat ricality with revolutionary iconography. From David to Delacroix, French painters sought to give pictorial form to rev­ olutionary longi ngs. Visual symbols on coins and calendars, statues and posters provided both semaphore and sacrament for the revolution­ ary faith. Louis Philippe tried unsucces sfully to codify the visual paraphernalia of the revolution ary tradition in public building and civic symb ols.

Daumier, who had, ironically, for­ merly been an apprentice in the Museum of the Monuments of France, brought a sculptor's vitality to his monuments of political satire against the roi-mitoyen. He was not deterred either by six months in prison, after portraying the king as Gargantua in 1832, or by legal restrictions against caricaturing royalty in 1835. Daumier merely moved into the richer field of social satire against the bourgeoisie in general. In his own daily Le Charivari as well as in La Caricature and another new journal Le Corsaire, he stimulated class consciousness probably more than any socialist pamphleteer with his picture of the bourgeoisie as a \"legislative paunch\" of bloated self -interest. No words could dispel his pictures once they were planted in the popular imagination. Lamennais observed that \"wit itself and talent are on the side of the republic .\" 62 Crayoned lithography provided the first means of inexpensively reproducing a drawing \"unchanged, ac­ tually as the artist made it,\" oR and it required no access to the subject being represented. The department of the Seine in Daumier's time sup­ ported 24 lithographic houses with I 8o presses and soo work men. Daumier's lithography provided an indelible negative picture of bour­ geois society for modern journalism. Many of his prototypes were sub­ sequently codified almost mecha nically into the cartoon culture of the U.S.S.R. The development of pictorial journalism through line engraving to off-set photography, however, involved technologies that were more ex­ pensive than revolutiona ries could afford. A new age of pictorial dis­ traction began with the first appearance of Punch in 1841, followed within two years by Illustrated London News, L'Illustration in Paris, and Illustrierte Zeitung in Leipzig. 6.J Mass pictorial journalism thus moved beyond ideology to entertainment and thenc e-in part out of sheer bored om-to chauvinistic enthusiasm.

Electric telegraphy first became a regular part of a news service on the Morning Chronicle of London in 1845.67 A tele­ graphic correspondence bureau was established by Berna rd Wolff in Berlin in 1849; and linkage was made by these two telegraphic net­ works with the last- and ultimately most important -service when Reuters of England extended lines through Brussels to Aachen in 1850 and completed the Dover-Calais cable in 1851. By the end of the decade the three services were exchanging news, and in another decade they began to work out a division of world-wide coverage. 68 However, the creation of a world-wide news network led not to peace, but to a restless search for fresh foreign adventure. The new telegraphic technology brought in excitement from abroad even as it increased police control at home. The network of telegraphic communications that had develop ed in England of the 184os helped to assure the effective and uniform suppression of the Chartist movement,69 just as the railroad facilitated Napoleon's repressi on of Parisian unrest across the channel. Revolutionary journalism had sought to engage the ears as well as the eyes-t hrough such journals as La Ruche Populaire, founded in 1839 by the Saint-Simonian folk-singer, Jules Vinc;:ard . The Germans in particular developed a style that might almost be called incantational. Already in I8I8-Ig the Weimar paper Patriot (the organ of the most revolutionar y \"Unconditionals\" within the Burschenschaft en) set forth their aims in a Grosses Lied-\"Ein Reich ... ein Gott, ein Volk, Ein Wille ... \" 70-in a way that seemed an eerie anticipation of Nazi in­ ca ntations at Nuremberg in 1934. Karl Fallen's brother, Adolf Ludwig Fallen, argued that \"newspapers are the wind by which the weather cocks turn.\" 7 1 He sought to stimulate a mass popular revolution in Germany by journalistic propaganda that relied heavily on songs of heroism and sacrific e. His agitational songbook, Free Voices of Fresh Youth, helped inspire Karl Sand to commit political assassin ation in 1819 by invoking a host of historical models from William Tell to the contemporary insurrectionist Andreas Hofer.72 The German communist press in Switzerland in the early I 84os added a quasi-religious element reminis cent at times of the Reformat ion pat­ tern of hymn singing and family devotional readings. Songs and re­ sponsive readings were printed in a variety of forms to be read aloud­ at communal workers' meetings rather than silently and individu ally by the bourgeois firesi de. There was even a \"Communist Lord's Prayer \": Also sei's! In deinem heil'gen Namen Werfen wir den alten Triidel urn: Keine Herrn und keine Diener ! Amen !

Made desperate by the failure of 1848, they developed the new idea that a journalist was not merely an \"apostle,\" but a prophet and priest as well. They shared the belief expressed by a dying Communist a century later that their very souls \"would perma­ nently corrode\" if they did not perform their sacred duties on a daily basis : I held on to my profession in the ma nner of religion. Editing my daily arti­ cle was the daily sacram ent .7 4 Such ideological dedicat ion among communist journa lists of the mid­ twentieth century was in some ways only the delayed result of the communications revolution a centu ry earlier: the discovery of the word communism in the journalism of the I 84os and the linkage of ideolog­ ical journalism to revolutionary organization in the I8sos. Victorian London was the holy city for the new faith in the power of the press. Mill had written that \"the subversion of established insti­ tutions is merely one consequence of the previous subversion of es­ tablished opinio ns.\" '6 Julian Harney, when founding both the radical wing of the Chartist movement and the Democratic Association in 1837, had stressed the dependence of both upon journalistic support : \"A new age will commence\" only with \"the liberation of the press.\" 76 The pioneering communist Theophile Thore defended himself at his trial in 1840 as a kind of Socrate s, who had substituted printer's ink for philosopher's hemlock : Thanks to printing and to the press, we have today means of intellectual propaganda that the ancients did not imagine. Without going out to con­ verse in the shops and preach on the squares, we can send the radiations of our thought directly in the hearts of men of good will .77 Barmby saw the media replacing Christ as well as Socrat es: Since the discovery of the printing press ... the mission of the editor has by degrees superseded that of the parson -priest, the desk has become more use ful than the pulpit, the leading Saturday article more saving than the drawling Sunday sermon .7s Belief in the priestly function of radical journalism led to feelings of saintly succession among journals. The Hunga rian revolution ary tra­ dition built on the charismatic power of Louis Kossuth's daily Pesti Hirlap (Journal of Pest), which vaulted in the first six months of I84I from sixty to five thousand subscr ibers.79 The Russian revolutionary tradition built similarly on the appeal of the radical journalist of the I 84os, Vissa rion Belinsky.

As a member of this coterie, Marx helped explore plans for journals that never came into being (Zeitschrift fur Theaterkritik and Archiv des Atheismus ), 81 then collaborated on some that did (Deutsche ] ahrbucher and Rheini­ sche Zeitung ); and he first became a polemic leader in I 842 at the age of twen ty-four when he was made chief editor of the Rheinische Zeit­ ung. His journal set itself up as the rival to the hitherto dominant Augs­ burger Allgemeine Zeitung . In the German world a political press was coming into being even before there was a legal political association. Marx explained the advantages of such inverted development in the New Year's issue of his journal for I843· German newspapers could play an exalted pedagogic function on the awakening politica l imagination, he said, and not merely deal with complex interest groups like the English and the Frenc h, who had to respond to \"existin g, already formed power.\" The infant German press was not bound passively to \"express the thoughts, the interests of the people. You first create them or rather impute them to the people. You create party spirit.\" 82 Thus in Marx's view journalism had the respon sibility of creating \"party spirit,\" the direct ancestor of Lenin's partiinost'. For both men this desire to create party spirit preceded the firm idea of a political party. It was as the editor of Rheinische Zeitung that Marx was first intro­ duced to economic questions when he was forced to develop opinions about produc tivity in the Mosel and about the general problems of free trade and tariffs. s:l Much of his subsequent education in political econ­ omy was conducted in the form of seminars with editorial colleagues. H 1 The revolutionary fire burned brightest in the journals of the emigres in cities like Paris, Brussels, and London (to which Marx fled succes­ sively ), and in Switzerland and Americ a. In such places, the journal became the rallying point and organizational center for a desperate and alienated constituency. The Thuringian preacher's son Julius Frobel moved to Switzerland in I835 and established a new publishing house, which he character ized as the \"armory of the party of the futur e\"; 8 5 this \"armory\" helped Weitling forge the ideological weapons of the first communist organizat ions. The revolutionaries who had left Europe in large numbers after 1848- 50 and embarked on a new life in America rarely fed back any sig­ nificant arms or ideas to their former comrades in the Old World.86 Marx, of course, had in a way also fled to Americ a-in the sense of using Charles Dana's New York Tribune as his new journ alistic outlet. In his journalism in the 18sos, he enlarged the global perspective he had already introduced on the Neue Rheinische Zeitung in Cologne during the turmoil of I848. The Cologne Workers' Union had been the"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"------ ------ ------- ---�--- The Magic Medium: Journalism only one in Germany with its own official journal; 87 thus Marx was free of the responsibility of dealing with local affairs in his periodic al, and he ranged widely over remote areas of time and space in search of instructive material for revolutionar ies. The latest student of the period argues that one must speak of a \"party of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung\" during this period rather than of a \"Party of the League of Commu­ nists.\" 88 In London Marx plunged deeper into journalism, enriching his reports with material from the British Museum and from the daily press, which was fed by Reuters' News Agency. His journalistic anal­ yses helped account for his failure to finish his magnum opus , Das Kapital. Marx's major disputes with Weitling and Proudhon before the Revolu­ tion of 1848, and with Stephan Born during it, were in many ways those of intellectual against artisan in the presence of the printing press. Marx invoked the political symbols and strateg ic perspectives of the new journalis m. His opponents were preoccupied with the concrete concerns of local workers -somet imes only of the typographers. Marx's quarrel with Proudhon was, in this respect, an amplified repetition of the antagonism between the intellectual journalists who were the orig­ inal French \"communists\" and the proletarian L'Atelier in the early 1840s. Those with firsthand experience of physical labor like Born and Prou­ dhon played a greater role in the events of 1848 than did their cerebral protagonists like Marx. Typographers who were particula rly active in­ cluded Claude Anthime Corbon, vice-president of the constituent as­ sembly; and George Duchene, delegate of the typographers to the Com­ mission of Labor in 1848 and founder of Proudhon's journal Le Repre­ sentant du Peuple. This journal and its succes sors Le Peuple and La Voix du Peuple exercised great authority in revolutionary Paris; and the Leipzig journal Brotherhood, edited by two working typographers from the \"Gutenberg League,\" spawned a network of journals throughout Germany, and inspired pioneering working-class journals elsewhere : The Herald in Prague, The Workers' journal in Budapest.89 In the 1840s, the life of the editor ial and typographical staff of a radical journal became a kind of model for the new society. Here truly was a sense of community, built around a journal designed for ordi­ nary men in contempora ry language. Physical and mental work existed in balance and harmony. The tension between man and the machine was not yet present, because the modern linotype had not yet entered the craftsman's print shop. Its product was for the profit of mankind rather than of some absentee owner. Corberon, who with Buchez founded L'Atelier, the first French jour­ nal produced exclusively by and for workers , saw in the very act of composing type a liberation of labor from routine . He was the master of several crafts including wood sculpture, and he saw the production of a journal as a kind of Masonic initiation into a new type of frater­ nity.00 Born, who was both compositor and writer for Marx ' s journal in Brusse ls, had a similar vision of the collective work of producing journals as a model for future socialist enterpris e.

The national German movement of workers to improve their lot in the summer of 1848 by workers congresses and strikes grew in good measure out of the na­ tional assembly of printers in Mainz in June . Born remained at the heart of it, as president of the Central Committee of Workers, as the moving spirit of its official \"social political\" organ Das Volk, and as Berlin cor­ respondent of Ma rx's Neue Rheinische Zeitung .91 Printer-arti sans also played a key role in French events of 1848. Du­ chene and other typographers had been leaders in the banquet cam­ paigns of the 184os; and the typographers' union, which had numbered 3,ooo already at the beginning of the decade,9 2 provided an image of solidarity against both the higher bourgeoisie and the new, more im­ personal techniques of printin g. Here was an informal alternative both to the depersonalized new eco­ nomic system of the bourgeoisie and to the political and legal mecha­ nisms they offered the working class. In England, Belgium, and Switzer­ land as well as in France typographers began to form societies and organize banquets in the 1849-51 period, echoing the slogan : \"Toward the institution of a univers al, typographical free-mason ry !\" 93 The simple artisan ideal of human friendship unpolluted by machines and undiluted by bureaucracies was of course to be overwhelmed by the massive indus trial growth of the late nineteenth century. But the belief lived on that a printed journal could be the authentic voice of a popular revoluti on-a nd its typographical-editorial workshop a kind of model for a new communal life-sty le. Proudhon perpetuated this idea even after the National Guard burst into his office to break his printing press and scatter the type. In the repression that followed, Proudhon's collaborator Duchene was sub­ jected to so many trials and fines that he finally turned to the prose­ cutor and wearily said, \"L'addition, s'il vous plait.\" 94 Though the \"bill\" came to so,ooo francs and ten years in prison, Proudhon was soon free again to revive Le Peuple as La Voix du Peuple on October I, 1849, with Alexander Herzen as collaborator and finan­ cial support er.95 The Russian emigre and his friends saved Proudhon from the clutches of Emile Girardin , who had recognized Proudhon's talent and sought to coopt him through financial subsidy .% After Prou­ dhon's Voix and Le Peuple de 1850 were shut down, Girardin finally succeeded in taking over much of the personnel and lexicon of revolu­ tionary journalism for his new journal of 1851, Le Bien-Etre Univer­ sel.97 It was hard to promise anything more than \"universal well-being,\" and the enormous printing of Ioo,ooo copies impre ssed Napoleon III, who in turn took over Girardin's twin techniques of coopt ation and distraction.

Herzen's public ation electr ified a Russia exasperated by defeat in the Crimean War and filled with expect ations of a fresh start under the new tsar, Alexander II. Herzen also benefited from the fact that the journal­ istic media had become in the German and Slavic worlds during the 184os a form of liberation from the confines of the university with its abstract specul ation and lengthy lectures divorced from everyday real­ ity. When Belinsky (\"the furious Vissarion\" ) transformed Pushkin's old journal, The Annals of the Fatherland, into an organ of active social critici sm, \"the world of politics in miniature\" 9 8 in 1842, worried police officials referred to the journal as a \"part y.\" !J9 The socialist novels of George Sand were translated along with French radical criticism; and a secret police report identified the \"party of Belinsky\" with \"pantheism, communism, socialism ... robespie rrism .\" Ioo Belinsky died just before the outbreak of revolution in 1848; and Russia did not participate in the revolution but rather plunged into a severe period of reaction. Herzen filled the vacuum by propagating the idea that the revolution ary initiative had passed from West to East, above all to Russia with its peasant communalism and hostility to bourgeois institution s. Herzen transposed into the Russian peasant com­ mune the enthusiasm that his French friends Michelet and Proudhon had felt for the communalism of the fishermen of Britanny and the craftsmen of Jura respectively. The distinctive belief of Russian revo­ lutionary populism that the commune provided the germ of a new social order was set forth by Herzen in a letter he wrote to Michelet in the dark days of r8so from the French Rivier a. 101 Writings of or about Michelet and Proudhon (as well as Mazzini, Vic­ tor Hugo, and others ) were included in the almanac Polar Star, which first appeared in the summer of 1855, ma rking the beginning of an uncensored Russian press. Operating first with lithog raphs , then with type face largely transported by hand from Paris, Herzen and Ogarev placed pictures of the five martyred Decembrists on the cover and in­ cluded works of Belinsky within .1 o 2 A supporting network of secret correspondents within Russia pro­ vided part of the nucleus of future revolutiona ry moveme nts. 103 Polar Star, together with The Bell, the supplement that appeared more fre­ quently and soon supplanted it, began a large publication campaign in London that led to the creation of revolutionary populism. Soon ap­ pearing in printings of 2,500-3 ,0oo, The Bell coined its two great slo­ gans : \"to the people\" and \"land and liberty.\" Illegal student public ations began appearing in the fall of r8s8 in response to, and often in de­ liberate imitation of, Herzen's Bell-as typical titles suggest : The Living Voice, My Own Ring, The Last Sound, and The Echo.I 04 The birth of a new extremism inside Russia is partly traceable to the discovery of Herzen's Bell by a young aristocratic student in Mos­ cow, Peter Zaichnevsky. His imagination was fired by discovering the word socialist \"almost on every page\" of Herzen ; and he turned all his energies \"to seeking every possible chance to get hold of books which"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"3 22 THE DoMINANCE oF THE NATIONAL REvoLUTIONARIES spoke of this [word].\" 10 \" He secretly took the lithograph used to re­ produce university lecture s, and in I859 began to make copies of West­ ern revolutionary writin gs.

Moving for safety from Moscow to Riazan, this society-the first ritually to invoke the terms socialist and communist on Russian soil­ began the long Russian tradition of revolutionary audacity by daringly distributing its pamphlets into the chapel of the Winter Palace during services on Easter Monday of I862. 10 7 In May, it issued the incendia ry manifesto Young Russia. This remarkable call to revolutionary terrorism suggested that jour­ nalists might be leaders of the \"revolutionary party\" in its struggle for power with the \"imp erial party.\" Zaichnevsky rebuked Herzen for laps­ ing into reformism and liberali sm, for failing to realize that \"it is time to begin beating on the alarm bell (nab at) and summon the people to revolt, not to mouth liberal slogans ( liberal'nic hat') .\" 108 Zaichnevsky thus provided the rival name-Nabat-f or the major journal of Russian conspirat orial Jacobinism which was later published abroad by his friend and sometime collaborator Peter Tkachev. 1 0 D A different group, but one that came from the same new subculture of revolutionary journalism, took Herzen's slogan \"land and liberty\" as the name for a secret revolutionary organization inside Russia in I862. The organizat ion was inspired by an illegal journal of I86I, which had daringly printed four issues on the press of the General Staff in St. Petersburg. Land and Liberty took shape later in I86I around the editorial staff of the St. Petersburg journal The Contempor ary ; 11 0 and esta blished contact with The Bell, which published in London its procla­ mation of I 862, To the Young Generation, and subsequent special pub­ lications for soldie rs, Poles, and sectaria ns. In the fall of I862, Land and Liberty sent abroad its leading typographer, who set up a new press in Bern and discussed plans to unite with-or perhaps absorb and supplant-H erzen's public ation effort in London. 1 1 1 Then, in I862, Land and Liberty began printing major proclamations inside Russia in another illegal publicati on : Freedom. Martyred heroism accrued to the movement with the arrest and trial of two of its leading write rs, Michael Mikhailov, the youthful poet believed to have written To the Young Generation, and Nicholas Cherny­ shevsky, the radical literary critic who proceeded to write in prison What Is To Be Done ?, a novelistic exhortation to self-sacrifice and communal living.

These grew partly in imitation of the revolutionary nation­ in-arms of 1793, partly in reaction to subsequent Napoleonic conquest. The other nations that helped inspire this \"springtime of nations\" were the Americans, whose revolution had preceded the French, and the Poles and Italians, who most faithfully echoed French ideals. The ideal of national revolution had been inspired originally by the American Decla ration of Independence. The Italians added the idea of recapturing past glory and discovering new manhood through a na­ tional strugg le.

National­ ism, the old cause of idealistic revolution against authority, reappe ared as a means of diverting domestic discontent within indus trial Europe into emotional support for expanding European state power. This new nationa lism of the European imperial era- and the revolu­ tionary reaction to it-a re part of another story : the global drama of the twentieth century. Here one must deal only with the death of the old revolution ary nationalism in the fateful period that ended with the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. A new journalism and a new Napoleon were factors : and the last of the French revoluti ons-the Paris Commune of 1871-was a watershed. The Last Heroes Despite failure in 1848, hopes remained strong for more national revolu­ tions throughout the I 8sos. Revolutionaries everywhere took heart at the defeat in the Crimean War of Russia, the pillar of European reac­ tion, which had extinguished the revolution ary nationhood of Poland in 1831 and of Hunga ry in 1849. National revolutiona ries were further emboldened by Napoleon III's encouragement to movements of self­ determination against the conservative, antinationalist empires of both the Romanovs and the Hapsburgs. The Polish cause retained its Europe an-wide appeal despite the death of its symbolic leaders : Chopin during the revolutiona ry ferment of 1848-49 , Mickiewicz in the midst of the Crimean War in 1855. The latter was in the process of raising national legions not just for the Poles, but also for other oppressed nationalit ies, including the Jews. He died in Const antinople in the arms of his Jewish friend Armand Levy, who in turn raised a companion Jewish legion, \"the first Jewish milit ary unit of modern times.\" 1 Its dream was to liberate Jerusalem, its flag was to be \"the scroll of the Law.\" 2 Levy subsequently became the leading French propagandist for the Romanian nationalist move­ ment.3 The emergence of a new Romanian nation from the conference at Paris in 1859 provided a thread of hope for belief that the tide of revolutiona ry national ism might still be rising. German nationalis ts, frustrated in the Old World, flooded into the New World after 1849, bringing extreme ideas about a new nationalist inter­ national. A German Revolutionary League was founded in Philadelphia with the supp ort of the original radical Hegelian, Arnold Ruge, and an even more radical apostle of tyrannicid e, Karl Heinzen. Their plan, drawn up by a former member of the revolutiona ry government in Baden, ad­ vocated a messia nic world federalism to be led by the United States.

The defeated Hung arian revolutionary Kossuth on his triumphal tour of America in 1851 aroused sentiment everywhe re; and in the following year a revolutionary People's League for the Old and New World was briefly organized in Wheelin g, West Virgini a. But the revolution ary impulse could not be revived from Americ a; and the frustrated nationalism of the new German arrivals found its only outlet in the rising nationalism of America itself. In 1853, two German revolutionary immigrants published The New Rome, which anticipated in a remarkable manner the geopolitics of a century later. It predicted that Europe was now eclipsed by greater powers on either side : reactiona ry Russia and revolutionary Americ a; and that the de­ cisive struggle between them would be fought largely in the air. \"Eu­ rope will be first Cossack , but then Yankee.\" 5 The center of revolution ary hopes within Europe was London, to which Kossuth soon returned. Mazzini and other national revolutionaries formed there in 1850 a European Democratic Central Committee. Its publication was in French; but it had national subcommittees of Ital­ ia ns, Poles, Germans, Austr ians, Hungarians, and Dutch. 6 After the Na­ poleonic coup of 1851, revolution ary exiles with messianic expectations poured into London at an even greater rate.7 Socia l revolutionaries formed the Commune revolutionnaire, an inter­ national fraternity of revolutionary socia lists established in 1852 under French leadership in London with a branch on the Island of Jersey. Its introductory brochure was drawn up for delivery to France on the anniversary of the founding of the First French Republic . Subsequent pamphlets and its regular propaganda organ, Victor Hugo's L'Homme, were smuggled into France in such ingenious hiding places as a bust of Queen Victoria. s For this self-proclaimed heir to the revolutionary commune of 1792 in Paris, the vistas were univers al. The Commune called for a \"universal democratic and social republic\" and a \"holy alliance of the peopl es.\" 9 It joined with the left wing of the Chartist movement to form early in 1855 an international committee, which in turn joined German com­ munists and Polish socialists in a more inclusive International Associa­ tion on August 10, I856. l O This associat ion was the last of the old-fashioned international revo­ lutionary organizations rather than a prototype of the First Interna­ tional.I 1 It was essentially an organization for dinners and discussions by emigre intell ectuals. They busied themselves with a revolution ary social calendar, which commemorated almost every prominent arrival and anniversary. But they also began to question the belief in nationa l revolution and in political reforms without social change. The failings of nationalism were also those of liberal ism; so con­ cluded the ill-fated Russia n Petrashevsky circle late in I 849: The movement of nationalities is a product of liberalism because socialism is a cosmopolitan doctrine standing above nationality ....

Nationalism had bred repression of one people by another-Russian against Hungarian, and Hunga rian against other Slavs. In western Europe, Cabet and others attacked the symbol of lib­ eral national revoluti on-Mazzini-in a brochure of 1852, French So­ cialists to Mr. Mazzini.13 He was denounced at greater length in a man­ ifesto of December 1858, To the Republicans, Democrats and Socia;lists of Europe, which accused Mazzini of becoming a wealthy apologist for \"law and order\" : ... the Italian patriot, the representative of the republican bourgeoisie, who has inscribed on his banner \"law and order.\" 1 4 Ha ving told the prolet ariat to \"put off social problems,\" he should now at least tell \"his friends to put aside their plutocr atic tendenci es.\" 1 5 After further rebuking all \"plutocratic republicans\" of Europe, the manifesto called for a rejection of nationality : The States of Europe reunited in one sole democratic and social republic in which all the citizens must be producers before becoming consumers .... a union between the Proletarians, Democrats, Socialists of Europe is at the present moment an absolute necessity. \"union\" is the order of today, \"action\" will be that of tomorrow .16 The incorrigibly nationalistic Poles soon left the organization alto­ gether. New egalitarian rules introduced in January 1859 (dealing with complete equality of the sexes and a quasi-an archist definition of the revolution as \"absolute nega tion of all privileges, absolute negation of all authority\" ) 17 hastened the Poles' departure-a nd the organiz ation's collapse. Its last known public ation on June 13, 1859, urged that no sides whatsoever be taken in purely political conflicts between na­ tions, such as the Franco-Austrian War in Italy.

The association pleaded with the latter not to spoil their noble experiment with petty bickering and thus enable the exploiters of Europe to say: \"How can you hope to make society communitarian if a few communists cannot even live in harmony ?\" 19 But Cabet's fading utopia was a weak reed on which to lean; and few in Europe noticed the appearance in New York in 1859 of Joseph De­ jacques's remarkable new antinationalist journal, Le Libertaire, which criticized Garibaldi for wearing a red shirt without advocating revolu­ tion.2 0 Social revolutionaries found secure ground in Europe only in London with the first meeting of French and English workers' delegations in"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"3 28 THE DoMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES 1862 and the establishment of the First International two years later. The founding meeting of this International Workingmen's Association on September 28, 1864, brought working-class organizations together with emigre intellectuals in Saint Martin's Hall where, nine years ear­ lier, many of the same participants had founded 2 1 the International Association. Ernest Jones, the aristocr atic godson of the Duke of Cumberland, had opened that earlier meeting in the same Saint Martin's Hall on February 27, 1855, with a withering attack on the concept of nationality. Jones had succeeded Harney as the chief revolutionary internationalist among the Charti sts, and he led Chartism's last effort at political organization (the so-called \"parliament of labor\" at Manchester in March 1854) and its last major journa l (the People's Paper). In r864, he addressed him­ self ecumenically to all \"men of Europe\" : Kings have invented the idea of hostile nat ionalities so as to split the unity of peoples .... For us, nation is nothing, man is all. For us, the oppressed nationalities form but one : the universal poor of every land. 2 2 Jones, the greatest nineteenth-century English poet of the class strug­ gle, portrayed a simple struggle of good with evil: ... all men are brethren-but some are Abels and some are Cains, and this is a gathering of the Abels of the world against the crowned and mighty Cains who have murdered them. 2 3 The history of the F irst International was one of continuous controversy among social revolutionaries over how \"the Abels of the world\" should combat the Cains, who controlled the land and did not act as their brothers' keepers. Once the cause of national revolution began to wane, social revolu­ tionaries quarrelled among themselves with new intensi ty; but just be­ fore founding the First International in r864, Mazzini and his friends made one last attempt to revive the dream of a European-wide alliance of nationalist revolution aries. The Italians provided the spark for this last flicker of romantic, revolutionary nationalism. While other emigres were talking to each other in London, Mazzini and his followers made sensational, secret incursions into Italy; these fascinated readers of in­ expensive new mass journals in Europe throughout the 18sos. A climax came when a group led by Felice Orsini threw three bombs at Napoleon III on January 14, 1858, missing the target but killing 8 people and wounding 148. The handsome Orsini had twice before been condemned as a political prisoner, and he enjoyed enormous popul arity in England, where he had conducted a lecture tour and sold within a year some 35,ooo copies of his 1856 book, Austrian Dungeons in Italy.24 The London trial of Orsini's French frien d, who had helped prepare the grenades, \"turned into a trial of Napoleon III\" 25 and re­ sulted in the defendant's acquittal as well as increased publicity for the revolutionary nationalist cause.

There was a sense of deja vu in all of this. The original professional revolutionaries at the beginning of the nineteenth century had dreamed of executing an earlier Napoleon-and viewed his attitude toward Italy as a test of his claim to be defender of the revolution . Even the name of the first revolutionary organiz ation reappeared. The major society through which the new Italian revolutionaries recruited allies in Lon­ don, Brussels, and Geneva was called the Philadel phians. Like the ear­ lier society of the same name, it was an outgrowth of Masonry, which provided international connections and an outer shell of secrecy for recruitment. Some prominent socialists like Louis Blanc drifted into the camp of the national revolutionaries in London through the Ma­ sonic Lodge of United Philadelphia ns.2n Most leaders of the Interna­ tional Association refused to sign the association's official condemna­ tion of the Mazzinian program in December 1858; and many began collaborating with Mazzini even before the association collapsed in I Ssg. The Italian national rising against the Hapsburgs momenta rily revived the romantic belief in liberation through national revolution-even though the Italian success was more the work of Piedmontese states­ men like Cavour and of new bourgeois organizations like the National Society than of Mazzinian revolutionarie s. 2 7 Seeing Italy unified with the aid of Napoleon III, Hung arian and Polish revolutiona ry organiza­ tions in London began exploring new possibilities for conspiracy and possible collaboration with the new Bonaparte. Common interests among democratic nationalists seemed suggested by the appearance in London of vernacular revolut ionary journals in German and Russian, that is, Hinkel's Hermann and Herzen's Bell. Even hitherto nonrevolutionary na­ tionalists like the Czechs began advocating through emigre spokesmen like Josef Fric a broad coalition of anti-Hapsburg national revolutionaries. Fric and Hinkel clashed bitterly, however, in 1859 with Marx and Engels, who preferred German hegemony over the Czechs, and Magyar rule over the other Hapsburg Slavs .2R The arrival of Bakunin in London in 1861 after a long imprisonment helped revive the romantic dream of a revolution ary Slavic federati on. When revolt broke out in Poland in 1863 and a national government was set up, contacts and consultations were established with Czech and Croatian revolutionaries as well as with Hungarians and Italians. 2 9 A kind of anti-Hapsburg alliance of revolutionary nationalists came into being-and was formalized in a convention signed with Garibaldi in June 1864. Italian and Polish revolutionary forces pledged to continue the anti-Hapsburg struggle until all Slavs subject to Vienna achieved full auton omy.3o But the document was signed just as the Polish rebel­ lion was being crushed and Victor Emmanuel was drawing back from further struggle with the Hapsburgs. As Germany, Italy, and even Hun­ gary proceeded to achieve new national stature, the Slavs remained the main bearers of the old ideal of liberation through national revoluti on. In January 1864, Bakunin arrived in Florence and embarked on a"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"33 0 THE DOMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES feverish decade of revolution ary activity in which old and new, fact and fantasy, were difficult to disentangle. To some extent, this was only a replay of the revolutionary past: a visit to Garibaldi on the Isle of Ca­ prera, another attempt to create revolution ary organizat ion through Ma­ sonic lodges, and his joining at Garibaldi's suggest ion of the new lodge, Il Progresso Social. He wrote a lost Catechism of Free Masonry, and an organizational outline : Aims of the Society and the Revolutionar y Cate­ chism.31 Bakunin also wrote blueprints for a series of phantom inter­ national revolutionary brotherh oods : an International Secret Society for the Emancip ation of Humanity in 1864, an International Fraternity or International Alliance of Social Democracy in 1868, and a final Socialist Revolution ary Alliance in 1872. Behind it all was the vision of a lost natural society-with each cell a family and all members brothers. But there was also real novelty in Bakunin's focus on a social revolu­ tion that opposed any form of national author ity. In these last years he had become an authentic revolutionary anarch ist. He organized the first Italian organization explicitly to oppose the socialist to the na­ tionalist ideal : the Alliance of 1864, which direct ly challenged Mazzi­ nian deference to familiar political and religious modes of thought. After moving to Switzerland in 1867, Bakunin also tried to recruit a social revolutionary following from within the liberal republican League of Peace and Freedom. He then led his Genevan recruits into his Inter­ national Alliance-and also into the First International, where there began his long struggle with Marx and the Marxists. Bakunin's Alliance virtually created the Italian and Spanish branches of the First Inter­ national; and his ideas found much greater resonance than those of Marx among the Swiss and Slavs.32 Bakunin also attracted a following from the working class -first in Spain, where revolution had over­ thrown Queen Isabella in 1868 and aroused new social expectat ions; then in Italy, where Bakunin's following increased after the death of Mazzini in 1872.33 Hope of affiliation with Bakunin's Alliance attracted to Geneva in March 186g the young Serge Nechaev, who stayed on to write his Catechism of a Revoluti onary. Although Bakunin linked revolution to anarchism in his final years, his strategic perspective remained in some respects national. He arg­ ued that the Russians, Italians, and Spaniards were revolution ary by nature ; 3 4 and that world reaction was concentrated in the one nation in which he and other Young Hegelians had once placed their highest hopes : Germany. In search of a locus of evil to provide chiaroscuro contrast with the lands of liberation, Bakunin imparted to the Germans as a nationality the same demonic genius that Marx attributed to the bourgeoisie as a class. Germany became a kind of antinationality, which had deformed Bakunin's native Russia into a \"knouto-Germanic em­ pire.\" 35 The peoples of eastern and southern Europe, by contrast, were invested with precisely the qualities that the Germans had renounced , those of spontaneous, anti-aut horitarian brotherh ood. Bakunin revived Weitling's belief in outlaws and brigands as potential revolutionary recru its, and sought to link conspiratorial action directly to the masses :"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"------ ------ ---------- ---------- -- The Waning of Revol utionary Nationa lism 33 1 A few hundred young men of good will are certainly not enough to create a revolutionary power without the people ... but they will be enough to re­ organize the revolutionary power of the peop le.36 If Bakunin in the 186os was a throwb ack to the romantic para-military conspirators of the 181o s and 182os, his great revolutionary contem­ porary and sometime collaborator, Giuseppe Garibaldi, echoed the ro­ mantic nationalism of the 183os and the 184os. He became the last authentic hero of the fading nationalist revolutionary cause in the late 186os and the 187os. Garibaldi belonged, like Mazzini, to the London Philadelphi ans.37 He had grown to bigger-than- life dimensions as a symbol of national lib­ eration by carrying his struggle during 1836-48 to Latin Americ a, the original seedbed of revolutionary struggle against the Holy Alliance. As early as 1843 he had formed an It alian legion in Uruguay; it had taken as its uniform red shirts that were originally designed for work­ ers in the slaughterhouses of Buenos Aires .38 This red-shirt uniform became associated with human slaughter and the bloody shirt of revo­ lutionary martyrdom after the crushing of the Roman Republic . Gari­ baldi, who had inspired the besieged defenders, saw his Brazilian wife and revolutionary compan ion die on the retreat from Rome in 1849. The trappings of romant ic melodrama surrounded the Italian revolu­ tionaries in the final stages of their long struggle for national unity. Alexander Dumas sailed his yacht Emma into the Bay of Naples and put fourteen tailors to work on the deck manufacturing red shirts for Garibaldi's insurge nts.39 Some of them wore black with a flaming Vesu­ vius on the front-calling up an image of revolution long associated with the Neapolitan struggle against the Hapsburgs. Garibaldi reentered the scene to lead the anti-Austrian liberation strug­ gle in uneasy alliance with Cavour. When Cavour enraged him by ceding his birthplace (Nice) to France, Garibaldi set off from Genoa on May 6, 186o, with his famed thousand men for the final liberation of Sicily and Naples. There the revolutionary impulse had first appeared in the beginning of the century, and there the struggle with the Hapsburgs had an age-old appe al. The way had been prepared for Garibaldi's astonishing success in con­ quering the South and uniting it with northern Italy by the remarkable uprising of 1857 led by the Neapolitan nobleman Carlo Pisacane, the first ideological hijacker of the modern era. Pisacane was a profes­ sional military officer who had fought in Algeria and with Garibaldi in defense of the Roman Republic of 1849. On June 25, 1857, by prear­ rangement with other impatient revolutionaries in Mazzini's entourage, Pisacane forcibly took over the postal steamer Cagliari as it left Genoa, converted it into a romantic flagship of revolutionary deliver ance, and headed south. He released some four hundred prisoners on the Isle of Ponza (mistakenly believing them all to be political prisoners ), con­ tinued to Capri, and (after the failure of a hoped-for revolution in the Naples area) went on to Calabria.40 After some success in g ainin g p o p ­ ular support there, he saw his forces disper sed, and shot himself.

He enlisted the English machinists aboard the Cagliari and alluded to imminent French support. Indeed, \"great fear'' of social revolution swept through Italy-and was to haunt Garibaldi even in victory .4 1 (The romantic idea that a nation could be inspired to revolution by a ship of liberation lived on only among the isolated, unreconstructed Irish, who founded their greatest revolution­ ary organization, the Fenian brotherh ood, on St. Patrick's day 1858. In an improbable series of episodes based in America during the next quarter century, the Fenians chartered the sailing ship Catalpa to res­ cue political prisoners from western Australia, and then commissioned the first American subm arine, the Fenian Ram, to provide an under­ water link between America and Ireland that could escape English dom­ inance of the surface of the ocean.4 2 ) Like Mazzini, Garibaldi had hesitated to mix the national cause with the semi-anarchistic social radicalism of Pisacane. But when his own campaign proved victorious in the same southem regions three years later, Garibaldi felt some of the same bewilderment in victory that Pisa­ cane had felt in defeat. Liberation brought a decline in revolutionary elan, and a disillusioned Garibaldi soon retumed to Caprera. The effect of his victory everywhere in Europe, however, had been too electric to permit his early retiremen t. Early in October 186o, a month before he escorted King Victor Emmanuel into newly liberated Naples, Garibaldi called for an international legion of French, Polish, Swiss, and German volunteers.4 3 They were to aid in the complet ion of Italian national liberation ; but Garibaldi later suggested that these formations might also aid in the liberation of their own homelands. The first head of his international legion was a Pole; and many in the Polish uprising against Russia in 1863 wore red shirts and sang Italian so ngs.44 On behalf of these Poles, the last serious efforts were made to give reality to this old ideal of an international revolutionary army. Consultat ions were held in Dresden and Turin; and a Polish-Italian pledge of simul­ taneous anti-Hapsburg uprisings in Galicia and Venice was agreed upon with Garibaldi in a three-day intemational gathering in June at his island retre at. The London-b ased Philadelphians gathered together many former members of the recently deceased International Associ ation to support Garibaldi's campaign .4\" Like this Masonic group, the names of the other allies in this loosely structured revolutionary camp aign read like a summary of rom antic conspiracy during the preceding half century : the spark of a Polish uprisin g, the fantasies of London-b ased emigres (including Russian ideas of imminent uprisings among religious dis­ senters, peasants, and soldiers ), the rumors of possible Napoleonic deliver ance, and the inevitable Verdi melod y-a kind of Internationale for revolutionary nationalism -the Hymn to the Nations of 1862.46 Recruitment for the international legion was most effectively publi­ cized by Johann- Philipp Becker in Hambu rg; he participated in both the Italian and Polish uprisin gs, and campa igned in suppo rt of Gari­ baldi through his joumal in Hamburg, Northern Star.47 In July 1863, Becker journeyed to the Jura region-the birthp lace of both the first"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"The Waning of Revolutionary National ism 333 Carbonari and the first Philadelphi ans-to prepare for an international congress which invited in Garibaldi's name the leaders of national demo­ cratic movements from throughout Euro pe. Convened at Brussels on September 26-28 with Pierre Coullery of the Jura 48 as chairman and Becker as vice-cha irman, the congress adopted a resolution to form the Association Federative Universelle de la Democratie, a society similar in name to the Democratic Association founded in Brussels sixteen years earlier. This Brussels association of 1847 had been supplanted by the London Communist League. In like manner, the new Garibaldian Democratic Associat ion would be superseded one year later by a sec­ ond London-based international organizat ion dedicated to social revolu­ tion and dominated by Karl Marx : the Intern ational Workingmen's Associat ion, subseque ntly known as the First International. In London of 1864, the dominant passion among political exiles was not the founding of the International, but the organization of a tumultu­ ously successful visit by Garibaldi . The Philadelphians helped organize it, and nationalist refugees from the recent ly crushed Polish uprising helped fan enthusiasm to a fever pitch. The spectacle of Garibaldi's arrival sent fresh blood coursing through even the most hardened revolutionary arteries. Goodwyn Barmby burst forth from his rural Uni­ tarian parsonage in Wakefield, Yorkshire, to hail the arrival of this hero from \"full, deep-bosomed Italy.\" Garibaldi, he announc ed, was the liberator of everything from trees and birds to lonely nuns in their conve nts.49 Herzen, disillusioned by the failure of revolution in Poland and re­ jected by younger Russian radicals, threw a dinner party for this one shining symbol of victorious revoluti on; the dinner ended with Baba a la polonaise and Plombiere de glace a la Garibaldi.5o Even French ex­ iles, who rarely looked to foreigners for revolutionary guidance, hailed Garibaldi as a harbinger, if not a model, of their own liberation . 5 1 For a brief initial period, the First Intern ational included in its general council a substa ntial number of Philadelphians and Italian na­ tional ists. With their removal from the general council in the autumn of 1865 and the concurrent collapse of Mazzini's efforts to establish a new international of nationalist revolutionaries (variously referred to as a Universal Republican Alliance and an International Republican Committee ), a half century of romantic revolutionary conspiracy came to an end. If that period of revolutionary activity had been dominated by na­ tional revolution aries, the next half-century was to be dominated by the more p rosaic social revolutionaries of the first two proletarian in­ ternat ionals . The revolution ary appeal of nationalism had been under­ cut by the triumph of a conservative governmental nationalism under bourgeois auspi ces-in the newly unified Germany of Bism arck and Italy of Cavour; in post-Civil War Amer ica; in the proclam ation of do­ minion status for Canada in 1867; and even in two events in eastern Europe during the same 1867: the adop tion of a dual-nationality, Austro­ Hungarian Empire by the Hapsburgs and the nationalistic enthusiasm aroused in Romanov Russia at the Moscow Pan-Slav Congress."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"33 4 THE DOMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES Romantic nationalism had been built on the twin pillars of an asser­ tive vernacular culture and a heroic revolutionary movement for po­ litical self-de termin ation. Important late-blooming examples appeared on the fringes of imperial Europe in the late nineteenth century among the oppressed Irish of the British Empire in the West and the oppressed Jews of the Romanov Empire in the East. But the Dublin stage and Irish Republican Army, like the Yiddish theater and Zionist and Bundist movements, were brilliant except ions to the rule. The prevailing na­ tionalist trends in the late nineteenth century were those of indus trial development and territorial expansion by national states, which made varying degrees of concession to the parliamentary political forms of English or French liberalism. The dominant radical oppos ition was now to seek social more than political change, whether people thought of themselves as social revolutionaries or social democrats. The romantic nationalist dream did not die dramatically, but like Garibaldi himself merely faded away. Almost totally a man of action, unable to understand the political and economic comple xities of the new indust rial world, Garibaldi fought for the French in 1870-71 and served brief, bewildered careers in both the Italian and the French parlia­ ments before retiring to his island in the Mediterranean near Corsic a, whence had come much of the inspiration for his ideal of an unspoiled natural order. After he died in 1882, his simple dream of popular revo­ lution without any clear political program or social content lived on mainly in the adulat ion with which the nonrevolutionary Anglo­ American world regarded this \"hero of two worlds.\" Through posthu­ mous glorification by the great Cambridge Victorian George Trevelyan and the great Princeton Wilsonian Walter Phelps Hall, he became a legend. The future of the revolutionary movement, however, belonged not to this consummate man of action, but to the supreme man of theory, Karl Marx, who was to die only one year after Garibaldi. But Marx's heirs might never have come to power among the north­ eastern Slavs had not the heirs of Garibaldi established an earlier hold over the southwestern Slavs. The assass ination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by the conspiratorial nationalist Young Bosnia organization in July 1914 led directly to World War I, which made possible the Russian Revolution. Young Bosnia inherited the Mazz inian tradition of Young Italy. Its idealistic, nationalistic aims, quasi-Masonic forms,52 and ethos of youthful sacrificial dedic ation- all represented a reprise in the 1910 s on the preceding revolutionary movements of neighboring Italy. One of the two Young Bosnians tried for the assass ination inscribed in his diary just after the fateful event the words of Mazzini : There is no more sacred thing in the world than the duty of a conspirator, who becomes an avenger of humanity and the apostle of permanent natural laws.53 Garibaldi remained the symbol of the struggle for national \"resur­ gence\" throughout the Balkans --from the mountains of Albania, where he was known as \"a descendant of Skanderbeg\" (the great national hero ) to Russophile Bulgaria, where radical youth often wore a shirt"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"The Waning of Revolutionary National ism 335 called a garibalde ika.''4 Added intensity was provided by the Russian revolution ary movement, which radiated outward its own revolution ary pan-Sla vic nationalism and dated back to the 187os, when Bakunin and Garibaldi had rallied to the support of the Bosnian uprising against Turkey in 1874-75, a year before the tsarist government intervened milita rily.55 In the last years of his life, Bakunin was to make a final effort to recruit insurrectiona ry support for the South Slavs, thus trans­ ferring his hopes of a revolution back to Slavic lands. From the peas ­ ants of Bosnia, he was to turn in 1875-76 to the populists of St. Peters­ burg. And just after his death in 1877 Russian revolutionaries would begin the great chain of eastern European political assassin ations that led to Sarajevo. Mass Journalism Thus it was in the 186os and 187os that the old hopes for revolution­ ary nationalism and the old modes of conspiracy moved from the in ­ dustrializing center to the rural periphery of Europe. Coupled with this was another insidious and powerful development that undermined any possibility for keeping alive the dream of revolution in the minds of the masses: a new type of journalism. The revolutionary journalism of an intellectual avant-garde, which, as we have already seen, was ab­ solutely central to the 1830-48 period, subsequently became swamped in the competition for popular attention by a new mass press-a press that was either nonrevolution ary or antirevolution ary. The ideological journalism of the revolutionary tradition came to suf­ fer rivalry from two different sourc es: (I) the prosaic, largely apolitical journals of workers themselves, and ( 2) the chauvinist press with its dazzling sensationalism which transformed nationalism from a revolu­ tionary to a react ionary cause. Proletarian Preoccupation Journalism produced by working people has almost always been non­ ideological, and only rarely revolutionary. This type of journalism be­ gan in England and Amer ica, where work ing-class readers were from the beginning preoccupied with immediate issues and material inter­ ests. Such perspectives encouraged reformist attitudes that Leninists would later call \"trade-unionist,\" \"tail endis t,\" and ouvrieriste. In America, embryonic unions created the first journals edited by and for workers . The pioneers were first the skilled artisans working with intellectuals in the Working Men's Movement in Philadel p hia 5 6 and then the literate German immigrants who came to comprise one-third of the popul ation of American cities.57 Their journals all tended to be"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"33 6 THE DoMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES absorbed into the reformist politics of the New World. Even the later gener ation of transplanted commun ists, like Marx's friend Joseph Wey­ demeyer, began to redirect their journalistic energies into the political mainstre am-a s is symbolized by Weydemeyer's movement in the early I8sos from a journal called Revolution to one called Reform.5 8 Karl Marx himself became a regular contributor in mid-1852 to the bourgeois, reformist newspaper of an ex-Fourierist, Charles Dana's New York Tribune .59 In England initially, the working class proved more threatening to European authority. Beginning in 1830, scores of untaxed periodicals with an increasingly prolet arian editorship and readership began to ap­ pear illegally.60 They helped prepa re the mass base for both the Char­ tist movement and organized trade unionism- with Irish immigrants playing the radicalizing role that German immigrants had in Americ a. 6 1 In France, a workin g-class press first came into being in the im­ mediate aftermath of 1830 (Le Journal des Ouvriers, Le Peuple, journal des ouvriers redige par eux-memes, and L'Artisan, with Lyon adding L'Echo de Fabrique and the anti-Parisian, anti-in tellectual La Tribune­ Proletaire in 1831). 62 At the end of the decade an even larger and more aggressively ouvrieriste press appeared with the indefatigable for­ mer Saint-Simonians in the lead: 63 Jules Vinc;ard's La Ruche Populaire, a \"journal of workers edited and published by themselves\" in 1839, Philippe Buchez's L'Atelier, an even more important journal which was founded by and intended exclusively for salaried, physical laborers. 64 The point about these work ing-class journals was that they showed little interest in the theories of revolution ary intellectuals about the working class. Atelier, for instance, rejected the ideological pretensions of the original French communists in making the attainment of ma­ terial happiness \"a complete social doctrine . . . an entire system of philosophy,\" 65 and the rhetoric of Leroux in speaking of humanity \"as if it were a real person .\" 66 The work ing-class press was particul arly suspicious of socialist ideolog ists; and, in the period of expanded op­ portunity between the fall of Louis Philippe in 1848 and Napoleon III's coup in 185I, Proudhon's influence was great and workers' jour­ nals tended to be \"more revolutionary than socialis t.\" 67 But the prestige of revolutionary manifestoes was already shattered by the repression of June 1848; 6 8 and Napoleonic restriction and coopt ation blunted the revolutionary inclinations of surviving proletar ian journals. Once again the center of work ing-class journ alism returned to the freer atmosphere of England. The great exhibit of 1851 in the Crystal Palace and the reformist role of the Liberal party seduced many former radicals with the promise of incremental material improvements and upward mobility within the system. When, in 1855, the \"tax on knowl­ edge \" was at last completely abolished and stamping by the government was no longer in force, the main benefici ary of the new freedom of the press turned out to be the new sensationalist mass journalism. Once the goal of freedom had been attained, the very Chartist journalism that had been agitating for that freedom ironically colla psed. 69 Lon­ don did not cease to provide haven and ideas, but b y I86o, revolution-"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"The Waning of Revol utionary National ism 337 ary leade rship -and the Chartist tradition of revolution ary journalism -had passed to other nations. The International Workingmen's Association of 1864 grew out of a tradition of French workers' delegations visiting London-which itself grew out of Chartist attempts to develop Anglo-French collaboration in the 185os.70 The mature Marx, however, saw relatively little revolu­ tionary possibility in either the French or the English workin g-class sponsors of the First International. He increasingly placed his hopes on the rising German Social Democratic movement, the only place where prolet arian journals did not seem to imply renunciation of revolution . Chauvinistic Distraction The rise of a new working class created deep fears in the 1850s and the 186os. With the memory of 1848 still vivid, European statesmen not only provided social benefits to the populace in order to defuse social protest, but also entered the journalistic lists themselves to help shape public opini on. Conservatives like Bismarck and Disraeli no less than an erstwhile friend of revolutionaries like Napoleon III developed journalistic outlets and \"socialistic\" programs. Even in Russia, the Min­ istry of the Interior was involved in founding the first working-cl ass journal in that country in 1875.71 Thus began the long government tradition of attempting to infiltrate or direct the organization of the working class in the large indus trial complexes of late nineteenth-cen­ tury Russia. The real weapon against workers from 1848 to 1914 was, however, the new patriotic press. It hypnotized the masses everywhere -hitching the old romantic nationalism to the new wagon of indus trial state power. England led the way in the 185os, with a patriotic press that first put pressure on a weak Liberal government to intervene in the Crimean War of 1854-56, and then championed the purge of all cor­ ruption and inefficiency that impeded victory. This war, the bloodiest in Europe during the century between Waterloo and Sarajevo, drowned out whatever was left of the Chartist passion for social reform within England. Radical journalists in England contributed to the hysteria by baptizing it a \"people's war\" and \"war of the nations\" against reac­ tionary Russia.72 Marx, who was a leading Russophobe among revolu­ tionary journalists of this peri od,73 had high hopes that the war might call into being a revolution as \"the sixth power of Europe .\" 74 The Times introduced telegraphic dispatches from special war correspon­ dents and war photog raphers to make this distant war seem more im­ mediate and vivid than the more urgent domestic problems. The Times encouraged its readers, moreover , to kibbitz on the management of the wa r; and ended up depicting it as a kind of crusade for civilizati on, which provided both the heroism of the Light Brigade 7:; and the heal­ ing mission of Florence Nightingale. William Russell, a brilliant Irish correspondent of The Tim es, helped mobilize popular opinion for the war over the heads of vacillating poli­ tician s, and helped summon up instant outrage about its conduct that"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"33 8 THE DoMINANCE oF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES brought down once unassa ilable military leaders. Mter victory he be­ came \"a sort of king without a crown.\" 76 In 1855 The Times had a daily print order of 61 ,ooo, more than ten times that of its rivals; 77 and a new weekly began publicat ion in November 1855 with the fiat statement that \"this count ry is governed by The Times.\" 78 During the Crim ean War, The Times found an imitator in England's French ally, Le Figaro, which from its incep tion in 1854 also appealed to mass patriotism from beneath a format of conse rvative respect abil­ ity. The full-blooded patriotic exhibitionism that soon developed in the London Daily Telegraph was also characte ristic of the journ alistic ex­ periments of Girardin and others late in the reign of Napoleon III. The French coined the word chauvinism for this attitude, drawing the name from the popular culture of the music halls. An old vaude­ ville, La Coca rde Tricolore, had ridiculed an uncritical follower of Na­ poleon I, Nicholas Chauvin, for repeatedly singing: J e suis fran9ais Je suis Chauvin If French journalists discovered chauvinism on the eve of the Franco­ Prussian War, their British counterparts created a similar ism of their own to describe a parallel burst of popular patriotism during the Bal­ kan War of 1878. Drawing from an expletive used in pubs (\"jingo\" meaning gosh ), the British press began to speak of jingoism. The Daily News of March 13 described excessive patriotism as the creation of \"the new tribe of music hall Patriots who sing the Jingo song.\" 79 But the press itself provided the orchestration. As the \"music hall patriots\" urged Britain to fight Russia again, the Russians began to produce their own jingo press. Indeed, the creation of a new, antirevolutionary mass journ alism in Russia provided a strik­ ing illustr ation of reactionaries pre-empting the techniques and cancel­ ing out the appeal of a pre-existent revolutionary journalism. The story begins with Michael Katkov, who had been a radical in the late r8sos and was the first to use the word nihilist in print inside Russia. Late in 1862, Katkov purchased Moscow News, a journal that had previously been a semi-official state organ and had only recently become a daily newspaper. He assumed the editorship on New Year's Day 1863, and within ten days the Polish uprising began. Katkov re­ sponded with what Herzen described as his \"cruel crusade against Po­ land.\" 8 o Playing on antiforeign feelings within Moscow, St. Peters­ burg's ancient rival, Katkov proved that a privately owned press outside the capital could be even more reactionary than official governmental ones in St. Petersburg. He defined his Moscow News as \"the organ of a party which may be called Russian, ultra-Russian, exclusively Rus­ sian\"; 81 and its circulation soared to an unprecedented twelve thou­ sand.82 Using his previous experience in the radical ambiance of the \"thick journals,\" Katkov gave an ideological cast to repression, arguing that he favored \"not the crushing of Polish nationality ( narodnos t '), but the summoning of it to a new political life with Russia.\" 8 3 Making ample use of feuilleton inserts and of anti-in tellectual letters to the"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"The Waning of Revolutionary National ism 339 editor, Katkov's journal helped impel the imperial government to over­ come initial indecision and launch a campaign of repression. Katkov then introduced illustrations into the land of icons-r epresenting the new military governor-general, Muravev, as a popular hero and the dis­ tant Herzen as a devil infecting Russia with foreign discord. This journalistic campaign of patriotic mobilization helped shrink the read­ ership of Herzen's Bell in the course of I863 from more than 2,500 to less than soo. 84 The campaign, moreover, emboldened Katkov to press early in I866 a campaign against the revolutionary virus at home. He insisted that \"the true root of the upheaval lies not in Paris, Warsaw, or Viln ius, but in Petersburg.\" sr; The enemy became not outright revolu­ tionaries, but liberals in high places \"who do not protest against the powerful influences that give aid to the evil.\" S G The leadership of former revolutionary sympathizers in developing a new antirevolutionary journalism increased in the late I 86 o s through the serialized writings of two veterans of the radical Petrashevsky cir­ cle of the I 84os : Feodor Dostoevsky and Nicholas Danilevsky. Dos­ toevsky's The Possessed, published in Katkov's journal, caricat ured Ne­ chaev's revolutionary conspiracy with unprecedented metaphysical depth and satiric power. Danilevsky provided a seemingly scientific ra­ tionale for expansionist pan-Sla vism in his Russia and Europe, which described a coming struggle for survival between the \"Romano­ German\" and \"Slavic\" worlds. Danilevsky's work was published in a new reactionary monthly of I86g; its name, The Dawn (Zaria), was coopted from the revolutionaries' lexicon. Contributors included Herzen's for­ mer collaborator, Vasily Kelsiev, as well as the leading \"antinihilist\" novelist of the sixtie s, A. F. Pisems ky.s• Dostoevsky's novel began ap­ pe aring in I87I (just as Danilevsky's articles were being republished as a book ) in Katkov's Russian Herald. So important was this new journal felt to be in the ideological war against the revolutionaries that when Katkov died in I 887, a special session of the Council of Ministers was called to consider the \"crisis .\" The journal was moved from Moscow to St. Petersburg to encourage even closer links with official policy.88 Reactionary pan-Slavism was rarely promoted directly by government officials and never became an official ideology in tsarist Russi a. 8 9 Rather it was the creation of the new right-wing mass journalists who were often former radical intellectuals redirecting revolutionary impulses into foreign areas. Katkov, who previously encouraged rebellious stu­ dents at Moscow University, remained a periodic agitator for radica l legal reform . A former friend and patron of Belinsky on Annals of the Fatherland, A. A. Kraevsky, launched in I 863 a new reaction ary jour­ nal, The Voice (Go los), and sponsored its growth from 4,ooo readers to more than 22,000 at the time of the pan-Slav enthusiasm of I877.90 In that year, A. S. Suvorin took over the St. Petersburg daily New Tim es (Novae Vremia), and transformed it into an even more influential pan-Slav newspaper. He added a second edition and a new motif of anti-Semitism, which became in the I88os a principal theme of the new reactionary journalism concurrently developing in Russia's German­ speaking neighbors to the West.9 1 Yet even this gazette continued to use"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"34 0 THE DOMINANCE OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES revolutionar y rhetoric about \"new times.\" Suvorin himself in his youth had written a story called Garibaldi that was read aloud for inspirational purposes at the soirees of radical intellect uals.9 2 The new industrialism helped enable the chauvinistic mass press to replace the ideological journalism of the early nineteenth century. The crucial change in the source of financial support from subscribers to advertisers did more than inhibit direct criticism of capitalistic institu­ tion s. It freed journalists from the pressure to deal with the immediate and local interests of their readers. Journa lists in the late nineteenth century were encouraged by their editors to create remote identities and symbolic issues for their anonymous urban audience. News stories had to be ever more dramatic in order to compete with the grow ing volume of gaudy advertising. The situation grew worse at the turn of the century with the arriv al of pictorial and headline journalism. The regular use of photographs, sensational headings, and special editions accelerated the drift towards the excitement of passions through anti­ revolutionary nationalism. The \"thick journals\" of an earlier age seemed slow-moving and dull. The disenfranchised readers had lost control. The path was straight from Girardin's pioneering decision to rely on advertisers for basic support to the mass chauvinism that helped launch World War I. Napoleon III and \"Imperialism\" The drama of deradic alizing the masses through a new type of jour­ nalism unfolded most vividly in the France of Napoleon III. In ways that contempo raries never underst ood-and historians have only begun to invest igate-Napoleon turned revolutionary nationalism abroad into a means of political repression at home, and transformed revolution ary Saint-Simonian social ideas at home into a means of economic expan­ sion abroad. One cannot speak of the third Napoleon without speaking of the first; for the new Napoleon rode to power in large measure on the reput ation of the old. Napoleon III was elected president of the Second French Re­ public by an overwhelming vote in December 1848, and was awarded dictatorial powers three years later by an even more staggering vote. The Napoleonic legend had continued to cast its spell over many revo­ lutionary intellectu als. The original French Revolution brought Napoleon I to power, and the original professional revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century came together largely to overthrow him. Revolutionary thinking about power was, thus, influenced from the beginning by this supreme man of power. He set the agenda for a generation b y s h attering al l t h e o l d"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"The Waning of Revol utionary Nationa lism 34 1 political legitimaci es : by politicizing the Enlightenment ideal of uni­ versal rationality (the metric system, the Code Napoleon ); and by im­ posing it all on a backward world. Above all, he fed the romantic imagin ation with an aesthetic fascin ation with power-and with the possi bilities of changing the map and the life of Europe. Whether they came from the armies that fought with Napoleon (French Philadelphi ans, Polish Philom ats, and most Italian Carbonari) or against him (Russian Decembr ists, Spanish comuneros, German Tugendbu nd), the early revolutionaries were youthful soldiers who spoke French and thought in the grand Napoleonic manner. There was, then, a hidden model or \"superego\" for the original revolution aries. Bona parte was Prometheus unbound, a parvenu in power; and the young revolutionary was almost always both a restless Promethean and an outsider in search of power. The most important revolutionary ideologies of the restoration era -Saint-Simonianism and Hegelianism- were born under the Napole­ onic star. They continued to attract intellectuals who sought to provide purpose for (and thus gain access to) power. This politiciz ation of the intellect intensified under Napoleon. Saint-Simon first began writing spe­ cifically in order to perfect and complete the Napoleonic refor ms. His long and unsuccessful campaign to reach Napoleon directly gave him a permanent predilection for seeking out a power capable of putting his ideas into forc e. Hegel was enraptured by the Napoleonic conquest of Germ any, and saw the hand of providence in the completion of his Phenomenology at the time of the Battle of Jen a. His final political vision appears to have been a synthesis of Prussian reform with Na­ poleonic universality. The rational reintegration of society preached by Hegel and Saint­ Simon was inconceivable without the strange combination that Na­ poleon introduced into the world: a despot ruling in the name of liberation. However un-Napoleonic may have been the final hopes that Saint-Simon placed in the working class and Hegel in the Prussian state, the impulse to look for some universal secular transformation of society came as much from the concrete fact of Napoleon as from the ab­ stract rhetoric of the revolution. The Napoleonic legacy thus helped create the original revolutionary ideologie s; and the Napoleonic legend helped in more subtle ways to r evive and intensify the revolutionary impulse in the 184os.9 3 The bore­ dom with the politics and style of Louis Philippe would not have been so acute in a land that did not have a Napoleon to remember. The inse­ cure Louis Philippe, in search of some genealogy of legitimacy, cul­ tivated an identification with Napoleon . He returned the ashes of Na­ poleon to Paris for reburial in the Invalides , and erected his statue in the Place Vendome.

This new Na­ poleon wrote in 1839 the influential Des Idees Napoleoniennes, which called for a new supra-political authority avoiding all doctrine and seek­ ing only concrete benefits for the masses .94 This influential work, which sold soo,ooo copies in five years,95 re­ flected the ideas of the Saint-Simonians whom Napoleon had befriended during his English exile of the late 183os. He followed them in prefer­ ring administrative solutions over ideological or political ones and in his early interest in a possible canal through Nicaragua to further the \"mystic marriage of East and West .\" 96 The youn g Saint-Simon had progressed from early dreams of becoming a new Charlemagne to his final appeal for justice to \"the poorest and most numerous class.\" Napoleon III in like fashion turned from writing a life of Charlemagne in the early forties to a new vision of increasing production and ending unemployment in his work of I 844 : Extinction of Pauperism.9 7 Napoleon III did not share Napoleon I's fatal opposition to ideology. Unlike the first Napoleon, who came back from Egypt and Italy as a man of war, the third Napoleon returned to France from London as a man of ideas. He adopted as his own the Proudhonist proposal for workers' associ ations and benefits, and transformed the Saint-Simon­ ianism of his youth into an authoritarian indust rialism and an anti­ clerical positivism that greatly strengthened the French state 9 8 (and, incidentally, helped to gain for many surviving Saint-Simonians luc­ rative positions in banking, industry, and government service ). In this respect Bismarck was his imitator, transforming Hegelianism, the ideo­ logical system hitherto prevalent among German revolution aries, into a new and conservative German nationalism. The roots of this neo­ Hegelianism lay in the tract of 1857 calling for the building of a mon­ ument to Hegel, but warning that none would be adequate \"until the German nation would build its state into the living temple of purest realism.\" 99 When Bisma rck became premier of Prussia five years later he capitalized on the passion of Hegelian intellectuals for political relevance by enlisting many of them in the tasks of German state­ building. Many came to believe that Hegel's vision of a rational, or­ dered society giving birth to a neo-Hellenic flowering of high culture might soon become reality in the new Germany Bismarck was buildin g. The principal \"Napoleo nic idea\" was the cooptation of French revolu­ tionary rhetoric by the patriotic press, which Napoleon III controlled brilliantly. The problem of the press was inesca pable for anyone trying to restore order to France.

Napoleon created the \"national opinion\" that he purported to de­ scribe. So thoroughgoing was his control of the press that one critic complained before the legislat ure in 1862 : \"There is one journalist in France . . . the Emperor. \" 1 0 1 In addition to controlling the news agency Havas and flooding the market with sloganized pamphlets (L'Em­ pire c' est la paix, Le salut c' est la dynastie ), Napoleon bought off oppo­ sition newsp apers , streamlined the official Le Moniteur, and added a readable evening edition in 1864. This Petit Moniteur was published in editions of 20o,ooo and sold at a depressed price of six centimes­ thereby undercutting all other competitors, who had to pay a minimum tax of five centimes on each issue. The satirist Maurice Joly, in his Politics of Machiavelli in the Nineteenth Century of 1864, described the technique as \"neutralizing the press by the press itself. \" 1 02 Napoleon was a master of coopt ation and public relation s. He often offered prominent radical person alities jobs while stealing their slo­ gans. He sponsored banquets and even associations for workers , and sought to channel their growing search for solidarity. Housing projec ts, mutual aid societies, and other meliorative programs were introduced and lauded with publicity on his imperial tours. Unlike Fazy in Switzer­ land, who introduced worker benefits out of long conviction and after careful study, Napoleon simply adopted what his monitoring of public opinion convinced him was expedient. Historians have reached radically different verdicts on the motives and even on the results of the emperor's program. to s Essentially, he seems to have prepared the way for the charac teristic political formula of the Third Republic : the combination of revolutionary rhetoric and practical reliance on a permanent centralized administration left over from the first Napoleon. Napoleon continued his support of the Italian nationalist movement abroad, and espoused other, more remote national revolutionary causes. However, the suspicion soon grew that he was attempting to reroute abroad the popular impulses towards social revolution that had ap­ peared at home in 1848 and 1851 . \"Emperor of the French \" rather than of France, he increasingly seemed to use overseas adventure for do­ mestic prestige : war in the Crimea in 1854-56, conquest of South Vietnam in 1862, and the disastrous attempt to conquer Mexico in 1866-67. All of this called forth a new word of rebuke from his erst­ while journalistic friends : imperial ism. This, the last of the great isms to find a name, was used to describe the rapid expansion of European power overseas in the last two decades of the nineteenth century; but the term began with journalistic quest ioning of Napoleon III in the final \"liberal\" period of his reign , l 0 4 Napoleon's scourge during these final years was the last great polemic innovator of revolutionary journalism in the Francoc entric era: Henri de Rochefort.

Rochefort's was the direct voice of proletarian ribald ry : a Daumier in prose with just a suggestion of Rabelais, promising to \"register the misery of the laborers\" alongside \"the toilets of the Tuiler ies.\" 105 The very title of his first journal dis­ pensed with the romantic past and invoked the plebeian image of a gaslight atop an iron support on a Parisian street corner . \"The Lan­ tern,\" Rochefort bluntly explained, \"can serve simultaneously to illum­ inate honest men and to hang malefac tors.\" l O G His principal target was Napoleon , whom he assaulted with an unprecedented barrage of animal metaphors. 10 7 His journal soared to an unprecedented printing of soo,ooo, 10 8 and its easily concealed, pocket-sized format gave it European-wide distribution .

Rochefort and his associates \"prop osed to rally the entire Europ ean socialist party to establish through the journal permanent relations be­ tween all the groups .\" 112 Such plans were fanciful, but his format was widely imitated. Students in distant St. Petersburg (including Marx's principal Russia n correspondent, Nicholas Danielson ) tried to set up a journal with the same title and form at. Within France, Rochefort's appeal was so great that it had to be com­ batted not just with repression, but also with rival attractions. Girardin moved into the vacuum, and, as we have seen, he became in the late years of Napoleon's reign a leading troubador of nationalism and for­ eign war.

Many of the innovations used to sensationalize news originated in Ameri ca: photogra phic polit­ ical illustrations (in the New York Daily Telegraph of 1873), linotype (in the German-American press of Baltimore in 1885), and a host of devices used by William Randolph Hearst after his acquisition of the New York Journal in 1895. Seeking to outshine Pulitzer's New York World, Hearst used aggressive patriotism as the cement for a journal­ istic empire .l 1 4 He all but created the Spanish-American War of 18g8.

His transformation into the ultra-militant leader of France in World War I illustrated how mass politics had replaced not only the conservative state­ craft of the restored European mona rchies after Waterloo but also the French-led tradition of revolutionary oppos ition. The decisive watershed year for many (including the young communard Clemence au) was 1871, which sealed the victory of react ionary chauvinism over revolutionary nationalism. The German victory over France in the Franco- Prussian war led to the crowning of a new German emperor in Versailles. The concurrent \"liberation\" of Rome and its designation as the Italian cap­ ital added new imperial associations to the achievement of Italian unity. Germany and Italy-the foci of hopes throughout the early nineteenth century for an extension of revolution beyond France-thus achieved final union in 1871 not through a revolution of their peoples, but through the military and diplomatic power of their leading sub-stat es: Prussia and Pied mont. Bism arck's Germany realized Einheit (unity) at the expense of Freiheit ( freedom ), under an emperor rather than a constitution. Italy under Cavour was subordinated not to Mazzini's \"Rome of the people,\" but to the Rome of a new king.

It triggered the swing to the Right throughout Europ e-and opened up new horizons for the revolutionary Left. The Paris Commune The Paris Commune of I87I was the largest urban insurrection of the nineteenth century-and precipitated the bloodiest repression. It was a watershed in revolutionary histo ry: the last of the Paris-based revolu­ tions, bringing to an end the French domination of the revolution ary tradition. The Paris uprising was the first example of mass defiance of the new military-industrial state in modern Europe. The Commune created­ however briefly -an alternative, revolutionary approach to the organi­ zation of authority in modern society. Successful subsequent revolu­ tionaries in Europe followed the communa rd example of making rev­ olution only in the wake of war. Whereas the revolutions of I789, I83o, and I848 had occurred in times of peace, those that rocked Russia in Igos and I9I7 , and brought other communist regimes into power in China, Yugoslav ia, and Vietnam in the I940s, were the direct outgrowth of foreign wars. The Commune left a legacy of legends as well as lessons. It provided the Russian Revolution with holy relics (Lenin was buried with a com­ munard flag, and the spacesh ip Voskhod was equipped forty years later with a ribbon from a banner of the Commu ne); and with holy images (the classic icon of class conflict in Eisenstein's October -bourgeois ladies jabbing fallen workers with pointed parasols-was taken from a mural in the Paris museum of the Commune ). Myths of the Commune abounded among anarchists as well as Social Democrats in the period prior to World War I; 11 6 among Chinese cultural revolutionaries of the Ig6os 117 no less than Russian political revolutionaries fifty years earlier; 11 8 among the New Left as well as the Old in the Western world. Insofar as all later revolutionaries were to find unity among them­ selves, it was in the singing of the great hymn that emerged from the martyrdom of I 87 I : the Internation ale. The simple fact of the Commune was that a revolutionary alliance ruled Paris for seventy-two days in the spring of I87I. It began as a patriotic protest against capitulation to the Prussian siege of Paris by a provisional French government formed after the defeat and flight of Napoleon III in September I87o. But the Commune soon became a vehicle for proletarian protest against the modern centralized state.

There were echoes as far afield as the Muslim quarter of Algiers 119 and provincial Russia. The leader of a student circle moved between Vilnius and St. Petersburg, signing his name \"Communist\" and proclaimed 9n April 14, 1871; \"The World Revolution has already begun.\" He named his short­ lived journal The Gallows, and trailed into anonymity w ith an appeal to his count rymen on May 4 to \"respond where you are to dying Paris ... to arms! to arms !\" 1 20 For the historian of revolution, the Commune may be seen as the most extreme moment of a revolutionary cycle in France which began when Napoleon tried to liberalize his empire in 1869-70 -and ended only with the formal cons titution of the Third Republic in I875.1 2 1 The move­ ment was, moreover, narrowly Parisian. Althoug h there was sporadic in­ surgency in support of the Commune in other French cities, only in Paris was a new communal government elected and able to exercise authority. For the historian of the revolutionary tradition, the Commune repre­ sents a crucial turning point from the previous dominance of national political revolution to the coming emphasis on transnational social revoluti on. To be sure, the Commune originated in the intensific ation of nationalistic militance during the war with Prussia that began in the summer of 1870. The Parisian Central Committee of the swollen Na­ tional Guard opposed the armistice of January 1871 and spoke of the resistance possibilities of a new levee en masse. Nationalistic Paris turned revolutionary when the new central government of Thiers tried unsuccessf ully to seize the guns of the Paris National Guard on March 18, 1871. Thiers fled to Versaill es, and the patriotic leaders of France elected an eighty-one-member Commune as a rival governmen t-or, as some would say, a rival to gover nment. This new par ticipatory form of revolutionary administration resisted till near the end Jacob in and Blanquist demands for strong executive leadership, and militantly combatted the authority of the republican National Asse mbly at Vers ailles. The Commune attempted to move beyond traditional politic s, reviving dreams of a fundamental trans­ formation of the human condition on a large scale for the first time since 1792-94. Aspiration was no less intense for being unfocused. At first during Janua ry and February, hopes seemed to move from national to social revolutio n, as \"vigilance committees\" allied themselves into a \"revolu­ tionar y Socialist Party.\" 122 As the Commune developed, social revolu­ tionaries avoided formal parties, but generally divided themselves into anticentralizing Proudhonists and elitis t, statist Blanqui sts. About half of the ruling body were manual workers ; and another, partially overlapping, half had been involved in working -class politi­ cal agitation of the 186os. There was an authentic proletarian quality to the Commune's efforts to establish cooperative indus trial organiza­ tion and professionally o riented secular education . The verbal talisman of this unexpected social revolution was the word \"Commune\" itself. To most, it suggested \"a demand for decen-"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"3 4 8 T HE D OMINANCE OF THE N ATIONAL R EVOLU TIONARIES tralization of authority -a federal state where small self-governing groups or units would become the dominant feature.\" 1 2 3 The expulsion of the national government from Paris on March 18 was described as a revolution communal iste.1 2 4 It represented essenti ally a search for com­ munal authority and communal benefits. Marx and the First Interna­ tional were only distant commentators despite the efforts of the Ver­ sailles government to equate commun alism with communism. l2 5 A strangely festive air prevailed in revolutionary Paris under the souverainete sauvage 12 6 of the masses , from the parades that pro­ claimed the Commune on March 28 to the rapturous destruction of a totem of the Napoleonic cult, the Vendome tower, on May 16 just hours before the Commune was crushed. March 28 was proclaimed \"the festive wedding day of the Idea and the Revolution\" 12 7 amid general expectations of realizin g \"something more than a nominal republic,\" \"the thing instead of the name.\" 1 2 s In what Lenin called this \"festival of the oppre ssed,\" even funerals became processions of civic dedication. These and other ceremonies were often punctuated by the sounds of the new weapons firing on Paris. As one revolutionary poet wrote : The clash of cymbals can be heard in the dreadful silence between rounds of firin g; and merry dance airs mingle with the rattle of American ma chine­ guns.129 The new guns, of course, prevaile d; and the \"merry dance airs\" gave way to a dance of death. In the \"bloody week \" that followed the final entry of the Vers ailles troops into Paris on May 21, 1871, some 2o,ooo communards were killed. Another 13,ooo were subs equently sent to prison or exile. Physical horror was accompanied by an attempt­ largely unprecedented in prior repre ssions of revolutionary movements -to treat revolutionaries as pathological crimin als.1 a o The defeat of France by Prussia and then of the Paris Commune by the Versail les-based government seemed to represent the consistent crush­ ing of ideas by power. France had still been seen as the homeland of revolutionary brotherhood ; and surviving nationalist revolutionaries throughout Europe had rallied to the French cause. The last com­ man der-in-chief of the Paris Commune itself was the Pole Jaroslaw Dqbrowski, who died heroically on the barricad es.l31 Garibaldi and his Polish counterpart J6zef Hauke-Bosak (leader of the Polish national in­ surrection of 1863) joined hands to assume military command of the unsuccessful defense of Dijon against the Prussia ns; and this last great hero of Polish nationalism died his martyr's death there. 1 3 2 Defeat of the Paris Commune and the subsequent disintegrat ion of the First International brought to an end the French era of modern revolu­ tionary history. For nearly a century since the Great Revolution of 1789, Paris had been the principal center of expectation and the scene of revolutio n. The rallying cries of the 183os and 184os-socia lism and communism-were first sounded in Paris, where the genie of pop­ ular political journalism was also first released. In Paris, the fantasies"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"The Waning of Revol utionary Nationalism 349 of intellectuals provided spiri tual ideals for a materialis tic age-and prophetic prefigurations of almost every later revolutionary movement. All the congresses of the First International had been held in French­ speaking areas on the immediate periphery of France-as if the leaders of European revolut ion sought to be as close as possible to a promised land only tempor arily denied them. That hope died when the conserv ative Third Republic rose on the grave of the Commun e-a nd proved to be the most enduring form of government in modern French history. Thus, ironically, the French period of revolutionary history was ended by the very republican sys­ tem of government that the original French revolutionaries had fought to establish. Vers ailles, where the forces assembled to destroy the Commune, worked its belated revenge against revolutionary Paris. The Tuileries Palace, which the original republic ans of 1792 had stormed to establish the First Republic, was burned by the communards as the revolution staged its own final immolation scene. The Third Re­ public enlisted the economic power of the indust rial bourgeoisie and the military might of the new centralized state. It wedded yesterday's revolutionary slogans (republican governme nt, secular educ ation ) to today's vested inter ests. Both the founding of the Third Republic in 1871 and its final dis­ solution in 1940 occurred in the wake of military defeat by Germany. In the history of revolutionary movements no less than that of national armies, the period of French dominance was to be succeeded by one of German domin ance. The French Republic was as much a conservative, unitary state as Bismar ck's empire; and France soon followed Germany in transf orming the revolutionary nationalism born in the late eighteenth century into the react ionar y imperialism of the late nineteenth. With nationalism crushed and republicanism discredited in France, social revolution alone r emained intact as a revolutionary ideal. Within the Commune there had been two conflicting types of social revolu­ tionary: decent ralizing Proudhonists (emphasizing direct rule by and benefits for the workers ) and authoritarian Blanquists and J acobins (who in the dying days of the Commune established a dictatorial Com­ mittee of Public Safety). But there was no real leadership for either party. Proudhon had been dead for six years ; and Blanqui was arrested and immobilized before the Commune was formed. Perhaps the closest any individual came to becoming a unifyin g leader was the moderate J acobin Charles Delescuz es; and he gained special status only by dying on the last barricades. The thoroughness of the repression within France placed the burden of continuing the social revolutionary tradition on leaders from other lands. Two in particular, Bakunin and Marx, sought to define the les­ sons of the Commune and carry on its traditi on. The conflict between them became in the embittered aftermath of the Commune as central as was the struggle between Marx and Proudhon a quarter century earlier."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"35 0 T HE D OMINANCE OF THE N ATIONAL R EVOLUTIONARIES Marx vs. Bakunin The fight between Marx and Bakunin was in many ways only a deepen­ ing of the Marx-Proudhon conflict. Once again, it was a civil war among social revolutiona ries who shared more assumptions than either cared to admit. Both Marx and Bakunin had been radical Hegelians at the University of Berlin . Both developed almost simultaneously an early, lifelong com­ mitment to the coming revolution to end all social inequality. Both were convinced internationalists who rejected any purely national revo­ lution . Both sought to base their struggle on oppre ssed social classes, reject ing the elite conspirat orial traditions of the past. Neither par­ ticipated in the Commun e, but each argued that its heroic tragedy vindicated his own revolutionary ideas. Their conflict had in a sense already begun in 1843, when Bakunin insisted that the communist movement, then only in its infancy, was a deeply authoritarian foe of revolutionary liberation .133 Man's desire for local and national identity could be crushed, he argued, because communism was the expression of a herd of animals organized by compulsion and force and concerned only with material interests, ignoring the spiritual side of life.134 In the 18sos, when Mar x was writing in the British Museum, Bakunin languished in tsarist priso ns. In the 186os, when Marx was establish­ ing a central authority among northern European revolutionaries in London, Bakunin threw himself into a series of movements in southern Europe that intensified his anti-authoritarianism and anticip ated the anticentralism of the Commune . By 1866, Bakunin had concluded that local, autonomous communes were the only legitimate form of political authority. Two years later, he spoke of replacing the modern state altogether with a \"federation of the barric ades.\" His concept foreshadowed the Soviets that would later emerge in Russ ia: a ruling council of \"one or two deputies for each barricade ... always responsible and always revocable .\" 135 Bakunin rejected emphatically the Buona rrotian tradition of hierarchi­ cal organizat ion pointing towards a provision al revolutionary dictat or­ ship. He also sharply criticized the German socialists for their dan­ gerous insistence that \"the political revolution must precede the social revoluti on.\" 136 Against the German Social Democrats' stated goal of \"a free people's state,\" Bakunin insisted that \"the words free and people's are annulled and rendered meaningless by the word State.\" 137 He set forth a plan for a European-wide revolutionary movement against state power in all its forms on the eve of the Franco-Prussian War. The originality of Bakunin's program lay in his call for a worker­ peasant alliance. He insisted that revolutions narrowly based in cities tended simply to seize the existing power of the central state and then superimpose their authority on the countryside. Elitist, urban-based"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"The Waning of Rev olutionary Nationalism 35 1 revolutionaries like Marx tended to radiate intellectual contempt for the peas antry by denigrating their religious faith and their individualistic methods. Bakunin himself was just as hostile to these peasant attitude s, but he nevertheless argued that a display of hostility would only per­ petuate the separation of the peas antry from its natural revolutionary ally : the prolet ariat. There is no point in extolling or denigrating the peasants. It is a question of establis hing a program of action which will overcome the individualism and conservatism of the peasants .1 38 Such a program lay in unification for \"the extirpation of the principle of authority in all its possible manifestati ons.\" 139 Without such a com­ mon objective, ordinar y people in the cities and the countryside might be distracted by demagogues into a meaningless civil war under rival banners of political oppr ession-peasants rallying to mon archy, work­ ers dying for a republic. The lower classes had to be liberated from attachment to either banner and unified by a Proudhonist-type socia l revolution that would \"foster the self-organization of the masses into autonomous bodies federated from the bottom upward.\" 14 0 Bakunin sought to begin this international anarcho-socialist revolution in the cities of southern France. He placed special hopes on Lyon, where his disciples staged a demonstration in March 1870. If Paris were to succeed first, he insisted, it must renounce immediately all claim to govern and organize France .14 1 In the spring of 1870, he envisaged revolution spreading from France to the neighboring urban centers of Italy and Spain, and on through the dissident Slavs in the Hapsburg Empire to his native Russ ia.14 2 In September 1870, immediately after the decisive Prussian defeat of the French army and the demise of Napoleon III, Bakunin arrived in Lyon to lead a brief communal uprisi ng; it was soon echoed in Mar­ seilles. His appeal of September 25, The Revolutionary Federation of Communes, identified Bism arck's Prussia as the main foe of social revolution . Even before the final defeat of the French armie s, he spoke of the need to \"put down the Prussians within in order to move with confidence and security against the Prussians from witho ut.\" 1 43 He incited immediate communal revolution, because the centr alized French state was destined hence forth to be \"little more than a vice-royalty of Germany\" ; 144 and he called for \"a war to the death\" between \"popular revolution\" and \"the milit ary, bureaucratic and mon archical despo­ tism\" of Germany.145 The second wave of revolution struck France when the Paris Commune arose in the spring of 1871. Bakunin played no direct role; but in exile in Switze rland, he feverishly wrote his longest work, part of which was published in July 1871: The Knouto-Ger manic Empire, or the Social Revolution. The genius of the Paris Commune was, in Bakunin's view, to present an authentic social revolutionary alterna tive to \"God and the Sta te\"­ the twin sources of all oppr ession. 1 4 6 For Bakunin, the villains within the revolutionary camp were the"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"- --- -· ·�---------- --�-- ·--- 3 5 2 T HE D oMINANCE OF THE N ATIONAL R EVOLU TIONARIES Jacobin leaders, who eventua lly imposed \"dictatorial and governmental conceptions\" on the Commune, and Mazzini, who had misled the Italian revolution with \"obsolescent religious idealism\" into \"the political lust for state grandeur .\" 147 Insisting that social revolution must be \"dia­ metrically opposed\" to political revolution ,14 8 Bakunin made his last subst antial group of conversions to the revolutionary cause at Maz­ zini's expense between the summer of 1871 and the summer of 1872, when an Italian Federation of the International was founded by his new followers in Rimi ni. Other future anarchists like Johann Most in Austria would indepen­ dently echo Bakunin's view of the Commune as the harbinger of the most fundamental of all social revoluti ons.H9 And among the Slavic and Latin peoples, where the state was particular ly authoritarian (and where industrial development was not far advanc ed), the Bakunin ist vision dominated the revolutionary imagin ation. Bakunin's principal rival was, of course, Karl Marx, who embodied precisely the authoritarian German instincts and political preoccupa­ tions that Bakunin detested. Characte ristically, Marx's great essay on the Commune, \"Civil War in France,\" was written in the form of an address of the General Coun cil to the memb ership of the International Workin gmen's Associat ion. Lack­ ing much of a following among the rank and file of the Internat ional (outside of its relat ively small number of English- and German-speaking affiliat es), Marx consistently sought to work through the executive struc­ ture of the London-based General Council of the International rather than through its autonomous federations and general cong resses. Marx's essay was written as the final executions in Paris were taking place. In it, Marx not only rediscovered the revolutionary passion of 1848 , but also anticip ated the new polemic style of 1917 and beyond. There was, first of all, a reaffirmation of the necess ary link between revolution and violen ce : \"Paris armed was the Revolution armed ... a slaveholders' rebelli on.\" 15o He then proceeded to explain the success of the repression largel y by depicting Alphonse Thiers as a villain without parallel even in Marx's rich repert oire of polemic vitriol. This \"parlia­ mentary Tom Thumb, permitted to play the part of a Tamerlane\" 151 was portrayed as \"a virtuoso in perjury and treason,\" with \"vanity in the place of a heart\" -\"a monstrous gnome\" 152 who has charmed the French bourgeoisie for almost half a century, because he is the most consummate intellectua l expression of their own class corruption .I 5 3 Marx extended the usual revolutionar y argument about violence as a necessary posture of defense into the contention that Thiers was \"the real murderer\" of the Archbishop of Paris, whom the communards had killed along with sixty-four other hostages. 154 The Commune encouraged Marx to believe that new political forms could advance social revolution -just as it encouraged Bakunin to ar­ gue that political forms had held the Commune back from social revo­ lution. Marx traced its origins to politic al force s. For him the Commune was not-as it was for Bakunin-a kind of metaphysical opposite to the"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"The Waning of Rev olutionary Nationalism 353 Germanic principle of authority ; for Marx the Commune was a dialecti­ cal development that arose out of French politics as \"the direct anti­ thesis to the Empire.\" 155 The Commune emerged logic ally from the Empire, in Marx's view. Napoleon's indust rialization created a revolu­ tionary proletar iat; Napoleon's imperialism armed it and created the wars among nations that the mobilized working class was now con­ verting into wars between classes. Lenin's argument of the World War I period in Imperialism, The Highest Stage of Capitalism, was antici­ pated in Marx's contention that imperialism under Napoleon III has al­ ready become the ultimate form of the State power ... [of] full-grown bourgeois society ... for the enslavement of labour by capital . .. , 1 5 6 Marx's vision of the Commune as an instrument of politic al deliver­ ance from imperial war was likewise later transposed into Lenin's vision of the Soviets as a political mechanism for establishing pro­ letarian power during World War I. Even Lenin's confidence in the power of the urban revolution to penetrate the countryside may have been anticipated in Marx's ill-founded belief in \"the appeal of the Com­ mune to the living interests and urgent wants of the peasa ntry.\" 157 When Lenin reached for a slogan for the confisc ation of private property in 1917, he borrowed one that Marx had attributed to the less confisc atory communar ds: \"the expropriation of the expropri ators .\" 1 5 8 In 1871 as in 1848, Marx turned for support to the most remorseless of revolutionari es : the followers of Blanqui. These \"Blanquists,\" whom Marx ridiculed in tranquil times as \"alchemists of revolution,\" provided Marx in times of trouble with an antidote to despair-and to disintegra­ tion within the revolutionary camp. New followers had gathered around the legendary Blanqui after his release from prison in 1865; and he published for them a manual for insurrection in 186g: Instructions for an Armed Seizure.159 Though Blanqui was again in prison by the time of the Commune, his fol­ lowers gained prestige by their leadership within it. After the defeat of the Commun e, leading Blanquists under Edouard Vaillant were coopted as heroes into the General Council of the International. Marx cooperated with them in transforming this London-b ased execu tive body into a kind of embryonic embodiment of the concept that Marx had derived from the Blanquists in 1848: a \"dictatorship of the proletar iat.\" He diverted the broader congress of the International scheduled for 1871 into a confer­ ence in London that he controlled in alliance with the Blanqu ists.1 6 ° The common enemy of Blanqui and Marx in I 848 had been Prou­ dhon, and their shared foe in 1871 was Proudhon's anarchistic heir, Bakunin . Marx deliberately excluded Bakunin from the invitation list to the special conference of the International in London in September 1871. This Blanquist-M arxist gathering then proceeded to transf orm the hitherto relatively loose International into a disciplined political organization, centrally led by the General Council and explicitly com­ mitted to conquering political power.

The \"Sonv ilier circular\" proclaimed that it was impossible \"for a free and egalitarian society to come out of an authoritarian organization,\" 1 61 and insisted that revolutionary organi­ zations had to be miniature examples of the new society rather than branches of a politic al party. In the first half of 1872, the conflict gave birth to a new vocabulary. In March, Marx revived the word anarchist as a pejor ative term for the Sonvilier group ; and he sent his son-in-law Paul Lafargue to Spain to attempt to destroy Bakunin's politic al foothold there . The Bakuninists replied by introducing in June-f or the first time in history-the term Marxist to characterize the new efforts to establish authoritarian con­ trol over the Internat ional. They denounced Lafargue as an agent of \"the Marxist conspiracy\" and an \"apostle of the Marxist law\" (en­ forcing whatever Marx wanted ). 1 62 Bakunin fortified his own polemic languag e with another new term : authoritarian communi st.163 Marx and Bakunin each accused the other of organizing a conspiracy. Each drew a measure of support from a surviving faction of commu­ nards. A curious anticipation of future revolutionary history lay in the names used to designate the more and less authoritarian communar d factio ns : majoritaires and minoritai res. These terms, majoritarian and minoritar ian, were to recur in the Russian bol'shevik and menshevik.164 In both cases, the aggressive adoption of the majority label by the au­ thoritarian party transformed a tactical major ity within a small gather­ ing into the pretense of representing the major ity of a larger total body. Lenin's Bolsh eviks were as much a minority in the Russian Social Democrat ic movement as were the Blanq uist major itarians within the Paris Commun e. But the label was deftly annexed by the former on the basis of a majo rity in key meetings of the 1903 party conference and by the latter on the basis of a brief major ity within the leadership during the last days of the Commune. Another verbal anticipation of later Russian revolutionary history came with Bakunin's inven tion of the term socialist revolutionary in juxta position to Social Democ rat. 16 5 Likew ise, the international organizat ion that Bakunin had founded in the summer of 1868 as the International Alliance of Social Democracy was recreated early in September 1872 as the Socialist Revolutionary Allia nce.1 66 Bakunin thus originated the label that was eventu ally adopted by the largest revolutionary party in late imperial Russ ia. Like the Bakunin ists, the later Socialist Revolutionaries attached a key role to the peas antry that was never admitted by the urbanized Social Democrats. The Marx-B akunin conflict came to a head when Marx himself went for the first time personally to a congress of the Internat ional-at the Hague in September 1872. He succeeded in having Bakunin expel led, and tried with the aid of the Blanquists to require all member organi­ zations to advocate the conquest of political power as the necessary prerequisite to proletarian revoluti on. However, most national sections of the International rallied instead to the Bakuninist banner at a series"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"-- ---- ------- -----� ---- The Waning of Revolutionary Nationalism 355 of congresses held in defiance of Marx later in 1872. The International held a sixth congress in Geneva in September 1873, and a final one in Philadelphia three years later. But, in effect, it ceased to function after 1872. Following the Hague Congre ss, Marx moved its General Council to New York to prevent Bakuninist control. But Bakunin's followers steadily extended their influence in Europ e-ta king the allegiance of many local membership bodies out from under the limited central authority that Marx had established. The International was, of course, destroyed not so much by internal conflict as by the repressive conserv ative tide that swept through Eu­ rope after the Paris Commune. Bakunin's Revolutionary Alliance, which was conceived well before Bakunin joined the International in 1868, sur­ vived through the Jura Federation. Marx's fierce ad hominem attacks on Bakunin and his drive for a central authoritarian structure over the In­ ternational never gained widespread support. Slavic and Latin groups within the International particula rly sym­ pathized with the Bakuninist view that Marx \"like the cuckoo, came to hatch his egg in a nest that was not his own.\" 16 7 Many continued to believe that revolutionary leadership would still come from France­ and then spread to those \"peoples and fragments of peoples who have the revolutionary flame.\" 1 68 Many shared Bakunin's view that Marx had repudiated revolution as a search for liberty and had institution alized the same \"pan-Germanic\" authoritarianism within the proletarian camp that Bismarck had introduced into bourgeois political life. Shortly after the epithet Marxism came the taunt Bism arxis m.1 6 9 The conflict between Marx and Bakunin in the early 187os further atomized an already decimated Left; and, in effect, destroyed the social revolutionary tradition in west ern Europe for a generation. With Ba­ kunin soon to die and Marx aging and somewhat isolated, the interna­ tional revolutionary tradition in the early seventies lost its active lead­ ership as well as its first international organizat ion. The Marx-Bakunin fight left a legacy of bitterness and of unresolved issues that were to recur in subsequent generatio ns. The First International left behind a number of national organizat ions as well as a new tradition of trans­ national proletarian authority that was to inspire numerous other con­ gresses in the seventies and eighties until-on the centen ary of the first French Revolution -a Second International was to be founded in I88g. Meanwhile, in the course of the sevent ies, a new gener ation of revolu­ tionaries grew up without the sense of geographical focus that Paris had previously prov ided. Revolutionaries now tended either (I) to organize the working class within the new bourgeois state in the hope of taking it over (the Social Democratic position of most \"Marx ists\" ) or ( 2) to combat the state as such, using new violent tactics (Slavic populism and Latin anarcho-syndicalism being dual heirs to the \"Bakuninist\" tradition ).

For all Europeans who attempted to susta in the revolutionary vision in the later nineteenth century, the memory of the Commune remained sacred, and its glorification provided compensation for the hostile atmosphere of the antirevolutionary industrial state. The Lost Romance The romantic, heroic menta lity died with the Paris Commune. Both revolutionar y nationalism and French leader ship were undercut, and the intangible, indispensable element of romance faded forever from the world of banners and barricades. The communards had gutted the Tuileries Palace and toppled the Vend6me tower-symbols respect ively of monarchical and Napoleonic authority. But the Third Republic cre­ ated no monument capable of symbolizing legitimacy or even eliciting emotional support. In the late nineteenth century, the Parisian skyline was dominated by two new cultural symbols that soug ht to move be­ yond the political past-but only provoked further polarizati on. Sacre Coeur, the new Cathedral of the Sacred Heart, lifted its great white cupola over the former commun ard headqu arters on Montmartre-the fruit of a nationwide Catholic subscription campaign to expiate the sins of the Commune. On the opposite, left side of the Seine soon arose the 984-foot Eiffel Tower, the iron symbol of the new industrial city over the Champs de Mars on which the original romantic, revolutionary festivals had been enacted. The conserva tism of the Sacre Coeur combined with the industrialism of the Eiffel Tower to produce a new kind of state power capable of annexing and transf orming the forms of romant ic nationalism. Heroic violence of the ltalo-Polish variety gave way to the modernized, mecha­ nized violence of the new mass conscript armies of the late nineteenth century. The musical melodrama that had accompanied and ennobled revolutionary nationalism was replaced on the forefront of musical ex­ periment by a new type of opera that heralded the rise of the Germano­ Russian stage of revolutionary development."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"The Waning of Revolutionary National ism 35 7 Modernization of Violence The grisly repression of the Commune revived an apoc alyptical ele­ ment that had all but vanished from revolutionary thinking after 1848. Dostoevsky likened the fires in the Tuileries to those of the Last Judg­ ment. Lenin later spoke of \"the struggle for heaven,\" and Pottier of la lutte finale. This \"final strugg le\" of proletariat with bourgeoisie was not, of course, to begin in earnest for another quarte r of a century, when once again the military defeat of a European power prepared the way for internal uprising. Humiliation by Japan in 1904-05 would lead Russia into its era of revoluti ons; and Lenin-the man who eventua lly led the revolutionaries to power-would tum for guidance to the period of the Commune. Indeed his first move as an exile in Switzerland on hearing that urban fighting had broken out in Russia in 1905 would be to begin reading and translating the military memoirs of a leader of the com­ mun ards' military resistance : Gusta ve-Paul Cluseret. Selections from Cluseret's three-volume work were translated by Lenin's wife, and published with a preface by Lenin in March 1905 .171 Cluseret's hatred of sentiment ality and his emphasis on careful plan­ ning under a \"general staff of revolutionaries\" appealed to the post­ romant ic menta lity; and his careful emphasis on seizing the key points of existing governmental power provided a rough advanced blue­ print for the Bolshevik seizure of power in St. Petersburg in 1917. Cluseret modernized revolutionary violence. He infused revolutionar y thinking with the knowledge of modern, mass warfare he had gained through firsthand participation in the two bloodi est wars of the century between 1815 and 1914: the Crimean War and the American Civil War. A graduate of St. Cyr and a winner of the Legion of Honor for his re­ pression of revolutionaries in 1848, Cluseret had drifted into the revolu­ tionary camp via military service with Garibaldi's red shirts and the Irish underground in Americ a. Arriving in war-torn France as the emis­ sary of Bakunin in Lyon, he rapidly rose to become command er-in-chief of the last phase of the military resistance in the Paris Commune. His knowledge of modern warfare was enriched by his friend and adviser, the hard-line American Union General, Sherid an, who had been with Moltke and the new Prussian military machine during its lightning vic­ tories over Napoleon III. Cluseret's retrospect ive writings on the Commune advocated a new kind of total war in which \"no quarter is to be expected since none is to be given,\" 17 2 and provided blunt tactical suggestions for a fresh, unromantic approach to street fighti ng: attack by night, neutralize fire power by concealment, occupy corner houses, and so forth. Military and civic educ ation had to be closely integrated 173 in a new type of revolu­ tionary militia that would destroy property rather than people and con­ stantly cut bourgeois lines of communication and supply by means of flying column s.

Cluseret's advocacy of violent means for visionary ends was based on the belief that a socia l rather than national revolution was approachi ng: The work of the second and supreme Revolution will be to replace anew the social axis of capital in order to hand it over to labo r.175 Such a specter on the Left was used by the Right to justify threats of counter -violence that helped keep France polarize d-a nd often paralyzed -during the troubled life of the Third Republic. Cluseret's new stress on social rather than national goals, discipline rather than romance, was most fully accepted farther to the east; and, when urban social revolutionaries finally did gain power, it was in St. Petersburg in I9I7 under the leadership of Cluseret's Russian ad­ mirer . Lenin's revolutionary career fused the two major new forces that had arisen to dominate the imaginat ion of the Left after the defeat of the Paris Commu ne : German social democracy and Russian populism. These movements grew out of the rival traditions of Marx on the one hand and of Proudhon and Bakunin on the other. They reflected as well a new and more professional attitude towards the problems of or­ ganization and violence respect ively within the new indus trial state . The rise of social democracy and populism within the Prussian and Russian empires respectively signaled the waning of French influence and the onset of the Germano-Russian period of revolutionary history. The Mutation of Opera Turning from the mundane of violence and organizat ion to the sub­ lime, the decline of both romanticism and revolutionary nationalism in the I 86os and I 87os can be traced through the transformation of opera. This musical medium was, as we have seen, a touchstone of revolutionary passion; and its mut ations in this period reflect the trans­ fer of the ideological center of gravity in Europe from the Franco-Italian to the Germano-Russian world. As we have said, realism and materialism prevailed in France after the defeat of the Paris Commune. George Sand, the great romantic novelist, complained in her old age to Gustave Flaubert, the new realist, that she suffered from idiotisme auditif in the new era. She was no longer able to dream of romantic transformations of reality, to be both man and woman, to \"make words and music at the same time.\" 1 7 6 Like everything else, music was put at the service of the state. Opera, yesterday's medium of revolution, became today's handmaiden of reac­ tion. The Mute Girl of Portici, which had precipitated insurrection forty years earlier, was used in I87o to mobilize France for its reckless war with Prussia. At a performance just after Napoleon III's ill-fated dec­ laration of war, the cast of the Paris opera lingered onstage to sing La Marseillais e. The excited audience urged them to add the warlike song from the Franco-Prussian crisis of 1840: \"Nous l'avons eu, votre Rhin allemand.\" When the cast protested that they did not know the"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"----- ---- -------- -------------- The Waning of Revol utionary National ism 359 words, the weat hervane journalist Girardin shouted down from the loges : \"It will take longer to learn it than to take it!\" 1 77 Verdi, the patriarch of earlier revolutionary nationalism, retreated from politics altogether during the crisis of 1870-71 . With the unifica­ tion of Italy safely behind, he concentrated his attention of getting scenery and costumes safely out of Paris for the premiere in Cairo of his new opera, Aida, heralding the opening of the Suez Canal. This old Saint-Simonian dream of a canal connecting East and West through Egypt had become a reality in 186g; but it heralded the arrival not so much of the \"new Christi anity\" as of the new imperialis m. After the opening of Aida in December 1871, Verdi withdrew altogether into the majestic, apolitical worlds of religion (Messa de Requiem) and Shakespea re (Otello and Falstaff ). And Aida, which might have been seen as a drama of national liberation a decade before , was instead treated as sheer spectacle-pa rticul arly as it was mounted on the larg­ est opera stage in the world at the new Paris opera after 1875.1 7 8 Meanwhile, at the new theater of the Bouffes-P arisien ne, traditional opera was supplanted altogether by the operettas of Offenbach, which became the rage of the gaslight era in Paris. Light music for the masses -like the new mass journalism-p rovided diversion for reaction ary imperialists rather than inspiration for revolutionary nationalists. Offenbach's musical model caught on in one empire after another. It arrived in Britain at the very time of the taking over of the Suez Canal and the preparation of the title Empre ss of India for Queen Victori a. In 1875, Gilbert and Sullivan wrote the first of their im­ mensely successful patter operas, Trial by Jury, as the opening number for an evening of Offenbach. Concurrently, in yet another antirevolu­ tionary empire, Hapsburg Vienna was enchanted by one musical con­ fection after another that casca ded from Johann Strauss II, in the wake of his first success ful operetta, The Thousand and One Nights of 1871 . Offenbach's show-stopping suggestive dance routine, the cancan, was a popular feature of his operet tas; it was to become a symbol of im­ perial decadence and inanity to the more somber revolution aries who now loomed beyond the Rhine .179 In Germany and Russia a new kind of grand opera arose in marked opposition to the romantic , Franco­ Italian musical tradition. The parallel emergence of the very different figures of Richard Wagner and Modest Mussorgsky heralded a rej ection of the romantic lyricism and uncom plicated optimism of the Latin school. Ideologically, their operas expre ssed a new nationalism com­ pletely divorced from any revolutionary message. If there was a decisive moment of this transition from the Franco­ Italian to the Germano-Russian dominance of nationalistic opera, it might well have been the winter of 1862-63 in St. Petersburg, when a new kind of opera was born in the Russian north . Alexander II had commissioned Giuseppe Verdi to write the only opera he composed dur­ ing his service in the new Italian parliament from 1861 to 1865. The wor l d premiere of this opera, La Forza d e l D estino, in St. Petersburg in November 1862 was followed in February 1863 by the arrival of Verdi's"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"3 60 T HE D OMINANCE OF THE N ATIONAL R EVOLUTIONAHIES German rival, Richard Wagner, as guest conductor in St. Petersburg. Wagner's \"music of the future\" excited the awakening Russian sensibil­ ity, and inspired immediate imitation in Serov's opera Judith of 1863. Wagner contrasted the warmth of the Russian reaction and the coolness of the French reception of his \"music of the future\" by suggesting that \"the Russians now live in the future .\" lSo Most Russians feared the seductive appeal of Wagner even as they hailed his reject ion of Franco-Italian models. A gifted group of young Russian composers withdrew altogether from the St. Petersburg Con­ servat ory to form a new Free Music School dedicated to discovering an authentically Russian musical style, free from all foreign influen ce. The genius of the group, Mussorgsky, produced in the late 186os and 187os a Russian national opera to rival the concurrent German achievement of Wagner. Taken together, their accomplishments mark the end of the link between nationalism and revolution which had been a hallmark of romantic Franco-Italian opera. In a purely artistic sense, both Wagner and Mussorgsk y were far more antitraditional (and in this general sense revolution ary) than Verdi and other giants of the Franco-Italian opera. Each of them sought to transcend the romantic idiom -and indeed Western musical tradition altogether. Each sought to derive a new musical language directly from \"the people\" and new subject matter from the collect ive subconscious of vernacular folklore. The radical differences between the two giants tell us more than a little about the very different inner aspirations of post-romantic nationalism in Germany and Russia re­ spect ively. Wagner and Mussorgsky played important roles in the de­ velopment of national consciousness in each country. Indeed, their music provides a kind of prophetic foreboding of the two most fateful revolutionary upheavals of twentieth-century Euro pe: the national so­ cialism of Hitler's Germany and the socialist nationalism of Stalin's Russia. Wagner deliver ed-qu ite literally -the deathblow to the lyric theme of romantic love which had been central to the operas of romantic na­ tional ism. Subconscious longing replaced lyric melody in Tristan and Isolde, which was first produced in 1865. The first four notes opened up the abyss of chromatic mode rn music ; and the lovers were transformed into foredoomed nocturnal figures overwhelmed by a music of the sub­ consci ous, which achieved harmony only after a final orchestral orgasm left both lovers dead upon the stage. After taking lyricism away from the theme of love, Wagner proceeded to an affirmation of German nationalism in his next great opera, Die Meistersinger. First performed in I 868 after the Prussian defeat of Hapsburg Austria, the composer found himself enamored of Bismarck's successes and under the secure patronage of the even more con­ servative King Ludwig of Bavaria. \"My real self,\" he wrote joyously, \"is roaming the streets of Nuremberg\" ; and a trium phant sense of German superiority burst forth at crucial moments in his tale of the prize contest in medieval Nuremberg. A h eroic crescendo verging on a military march rose up when Hans Sachs , the symbol of German cul-"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"The Waning of Revol utionary Nationalism ture and virtue, punctu ated his monologue on the vanity of the world with Wie fried sam treuer Sitten, getrost in That und Werk, liegt nicht in Deutschland's Mitten mein liebes Niirenb erg ! How peac eful and faithful Secure in its deeds and ways Lies in the midst of Germany My beloved Nuremberg ! Meistersinger projected not a revolution ary but a conserv ative na­ tionalism. The old Sachs enabled the young Walter to win the prize ; and Sachs ended with a warning against \"foreign thoughts and foreign ways\" : ehrt eure deutschen Meister, dann bannt ihr gute Geister ! Und gebt ihr ihrem Wirken Gunst, zerging' in Dunst das heil'ge rom'sche Reich, uns bleibe gleich die heil'ge deutsche Kun st! Honor your German masters I f you would prevent disasters ! Take them into your heart; Let the Holy Roman Empire fall into dust. We'll have instead Our holy German art ! Wagner provided a \"holy German art\" through his monumental Ring of the Nibelungen, which was completed by 1874 and given its first complete performance in 1876 at the theat er-shrine newly completed for him at Bayreuth. To the new, imperial generat ion of German nationalists in the late nineteenth century, the Rhine was to become not just the artery of the fastest growing industrial comple x in the world, but also the mysterious source of a golden ring capable of bringing mastery over the world and the downfall of the gods. Whether or not one accepts the Freudian critique of Wagner as promising phallic deliverance through Siegfried's sword and Parsifal's spear, there is clearly a mobilization of sublimi­ nal emotions in Wagner's music. The young Adolph Hitler was an avid Wagnerite, returning time and again to the opera house in Linz to see the entrance of the knight in shining armor in Lohengrin, proclaiming Meistersinger as his favorite opera, and staging his own theatrical tri­ umph in Nuremberg in the monumental rally of 1934· Very different were both the music and the mess age of Muss orgsky's \"popular music dramas\" in Russia-but equally destruct ive of the ro­ mantic lyricism and revolutionary nationalism of the Franco-Italian school.

In his desire to make music express a truth that was both realistic and moral, Mussorgsky turned for inspiration first to the prose texts of Nicholas Gogol, then to Russian history and the greatest dramatic text of Russia's greatest poet: Pushkin's Boris Godunov. He sp ent 1868-74 -the exact period when Wagner was completing his Ring -writing Boris, his only completed oper a. This greatest of all Russian national operas dealt with a period of internal upheaval and uncertain mod­ ernization very much like that of Alexander II's Russ ia: the \"time of troubles\" at the beginning of the seventeenth century. Calling it a \"popular (narodny) music drama,\" Mussorgsky built up to the final scene in the Kromi forest which he called a \"picture of the people\" 18 1 and which the critic Stasov soon dubbed the \"revolutionary scene.\" This tumultuous scene directly followed the death of the guilt-ridden Tsar Boris and presented a succession of would-be leaders for the Rus­ sian people of the early seventeenth century who were strikingl y sug­ gestive of similar forces contending for the allegiance of the Russian people in the turmoil of the I 87os. The scene also represented a kind of revolutionary variant on the preceding scene in which Boris died amidst the decorum of a Boyar Duma. Whereas all was hierarchy and orderly procession within the tsar's palace, all was chaos and dis­ orderly flight in the forest. The rousing anti-aut horitarian chorus Slava Boiarinu, Slava Borisovu was sung during the famous \"movement to the people\" by radical students who went to the countryside in search of revolutionary allies in the summer of 1874 just a few months after the premiere of the opera. Authority was desecrated beginning with the mock coronation scene of the boyar Khrushchev (sic) and continuing with the humiliat ion of the hero of popular Russian folklore (the holy fool) and the symbol of arrogant, foreign ways (the Jesuits ). Finally Mussorgsky's \"people\" found their voice in the soprano's cry of smert', smert' (death, death) at the orgiast ic climax of a regicidal chorus. It was all remarkably prophetic of the role that women were to play in the revolutionary movement that eventually assass inated Alexander II. The masses in Musso rgsky's opera- like the Russian masses after the death of Alexan­ der Il-rushed to embrace a new tsar rather than to form a new revolu­ tionary order. But the last word for Mussorgsky was pronounced by the holy fool left alone on the stage alongside an alarm bell and a flickering flame, no longer able either to prophesy or to pray, but only to lament. The people were no longer the idealized narod of populist revolut ionaries, but a hungry liud, without food or hope. Bleak realism had triumphed over revolutionary romanticism ; and the same bleakness was to domi­ nate Musso rgsky's subsequent effort to write a national trilogy of Wag­ nerian scale in his uncompleted final opera, Khovanshchina. At the height of revolutionary unrest in 1877 he considered briefly the eighteenth-century peasant rebel Pugachev as a possible operatic sub­ ject; but returned at the end to the seventeenth-century Old Believers"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"The Waning of Revolutionary National ism who had supported the Khovanskies in resist ing the westernizing innovations of Peter the Great. Musso rgsky's Khovanshc hina ended like Wagner's Ring with the main characters consumed on stage by a giant fire. But there was a deep difference between the two immolation scenes. Mussorgsky ended with the bass voice of an Old Believer priest bidding everyone mount the pyre in bleak tones of resignation. Wagner ended with a kind of transfiguration as Briinnhilde ecstatically climbed into the fire joyfully to greet her husband. Mussorgsky suggested that the Russian people both yearned for political change and were un­ likely to find deliverance along that path. So stirring to the imag ination was the \"revolutionary scene\" of Boris, however, that when Lenin was forced to go into hiding briefly outside St. Petersburg amidst the revolu­ tionary crisis of 1917 , he reputedly answered the enquiry of where he was going by the simple reply, \"to Kromi .\" Thus opera by the end of the nineteenth century had become ritual­ ized entertainment for the reactionary, rather than inspirational excite­ ment for the revolutionary. Social revolution in the age of industrial­ ism and imperialism had become a grim and prosaic matter. The would-be makers of the social revolution did, however, find a new song to replace La Marseillaise, which had lost some of its revolu­ tionary luster when its final codification as the national anthem of the Third Republic was supervised by none other than the republic's chau­ vinistic scourge, General Boulanger. 182 The rival anthem for social revo­ lutionar ies was to come into use at the opening of the fourteenth con­ gress of the French Workers Party on July 20, 18g6. Meeting at a time of gathering national rivalry and with an unusually large number of German and other foreign delegates present, the congress was dis­ rupted by a chauvinistic group shouting \"Down with Prussia,\" waving the tricolor, and singing La MarseillaiseJS3 The French socialists re­ sponded by singing Pottier's \"Internationale\" in the musical version composed in 1888 by a Belgian for a workers' chorus in Lille .1 8 4 Thus, an all-but-forgotten poem from the time of the Paris Commune and a scarce ly noticed musical arrangement suddenly became the song of revo­ lutionaries looking beyond national identities to transnational, working­ class solidarity. Beginning with the congress of the Second International at Paris in September of 1900, it became the practice of international gatherings of socialists to end their meetings with the singing of this hymn ,I s 5 which has gener ally remained the anthem of those who believe in revolution through class rather than national identity. The Francocen tric age of revolutionary nationalism had begun in Strasbourg in April 1792, when La Marseillaise first rallied a revolu­ tionary nation to resist invading German monarchs. The age ended in the same Strasbourg in August r87o, when new German invaders subjected its civilian populat ion to four nights of devestating, con­ tinuous bombardment. This unprecedented atrocity announced \"a new military age\" 1 s s in which mechanized violence would lead to social revoluti on.

Power in both cases was directed through a central shaft ; and, by swirling the tube, the power was vastly increased for expelling a shell or propelling a ship. Rifling the bore of a gun was nothing less than \"the first missile revolutio n\"; 3 and the turbine engine was \"one of the most important inventions in the entire history of power.\" 4 Whether driven by stea m or water, it enabled man to generate elect ricity. Countries like Italy which lacked coa l were at last able to produce power for indus trial production. Then, in I885, one year after the appearance of the first usa ble steam turbi ne, an internal combus tion engine was applied suc­ cess fully to ground transport ation by Da imler and Benz in Germany. New mobility was provided by internal combustion and the use of oil for indust rial energy. No longer did man simply draw flame from coal in one place to produce steam power from water in another. Power was now directly generated by exploding volatile new fuels-oil and gas-d irectly inside the machine. The ma chine thus came to cont ain violence within itself. It was soon mas s-produced by other ma chines as the American system of interchange able parts combined with Ger­ man skill in precise microscopic measurement. The new mechanized world rendered obsolet e the romant ic ideal of a natura l order and the poetic, melodramatic style of earlier leaders . The subconscious model for revolutionary organization subtly changed from that of a structure to that of a machine. Gone now was the older architectural image of masons building a new \"temple\" for hu­ manity through the personal exertion of their mental and moral facul­ ties. In its place there slowly appeared the concept of a modern political ma chine driven by thermodynamic force and impersonal calculat ion . There was an accomp anying change in revolutionary personnel. Pro­ fessional people, often with aristocratic backgrounds, who viewed them­ selves as creative builders of an ideal order, now gave way increasin gly to a new type of intellectu al-organizer preoccupied with sha ping an ef­ fective organization for, if not from, the working class. The change from moral to functional purposes did not represent the triumph of \"technology\" or \"organization\" as such within the revolu­ tionary tradition.

The romantic belief in the power of heroic individual will faded after the death of the last Napoleon.

The old cente rs of grav ity-France, Italy, Poland-faded in impo rtance, as the new type of organization appe ared in Germany and new uses of violence were developed in Russia. Thus we return again to fire ; it was the blast furnaces and fire-driven machines of the Ruhr, the Saar, and Silesia that during the second half of the nineteenth century transformed a localized, semirural German people into the most industrialized and urbanized major nation in Euro pe. The fire-driven ma chinery which stood behind the rapid indus­ trialization of Germany was a product in effect of a \"second industrial revoluti on.\" Whereas the first Indus trial Revolution a cen tury earlier in England emerged through the trial and error of arti san-craftsmen, the new German accomplishment emerged rather from the labor atory of the scientist -engi neer.6 The ability of the new German state systemati­ cally to apply the discoveries of scientific rese arch to factory produc­ tion enabled it to outs trip France as the greatest power in continental Europe in ways that were even more decisive than the military victory of 1870-71. Social Democracy represented a systematic attempt by the Germ ans to convert their short-lived revolutionary conflagration of 1848-so into the more disciplined, slow-burning fire of a modern political machine. The German Social Democratic party sought to organize workers as ra­ tionally within society as the new engineers had organized ma chines inside the factory. Germany also supplanted France as the focus of revolution ary hopes ; and the poignant irony of this dramatic change can be illustrated by re­ counting the history of one French family : the Carnots . Germany in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries produced nothing to equal the technological genius of this gifted family of scientist­ engineers ; yet a newly united Germany in the late nineteenth cen tury succeeded far more than a newly polarized France in applying their ideas to society. Laza re Carnot had been the leading military engineer and \"organizer of victory\" for the original French Revolution against the counter­ revolution ary intervention of German princes in 1793-94. His son Sadi, reflecting sadly on the subsequent English victory over Na poleon and the exile of his father to Germany, concluded that the steam engine was the source of England's triumph. He thereupon probed its secrets and unlocked the theory of thermodynamics which made high pressure, fire-driven engines possible. His Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire, written in 1824 when he was twenty-eight, has been called \"the most original work of genius in the whole history of the physical sci­ ences and technology\"; 1 but it was to be his only book, for he died of cholera in 1832."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"37 0 THE R ISE OF THE S ociAL R EVOLUT IONARIES It was the Germans who developed most succes sfully both Lazar e Carnot's concept of a military ma chine and Sadi's theory of the heat engine. The former came with the victories of the Prussian army in the war of 1870-7!. The latter followed in the next fifteen years as N. A. Otto developed the four-stroke engi ne ; Rudolph Diesel began work on the engine bea ring his name ; and Gott lieb Da imler and Karl Benz, working independently of each other, developed the first modern auto­ mobile eng ine . By the time Sadi Carnot's Reflections was reissued in 1878 by his brother Hippolyt e, Germany had supplanted both England and France as the most dynamic indust rial power in Euro pe. When Hippolyte's son, another Sadi Carnot, became president of France in 1886, it appe ared that his en gineering experience and personal stature might rec apture for the Third Republic a position of industrial as well as political lead­ ership in Europe. He repelled the neo-N apoleonic cha llenge from the Right by General Boulanger, but was ass assinated from the Left by an Italian anarchist at a banquet in Lyon in 1894. German Social Democracy provided a form of social discipline against precisely that sort of random viol ence. It arose from the massi ve intro­ duct ion of the technology of the Carnots into the very different political culture of imperial Germany. The German Social Democratic party be­ came the first organized political body in modern times to gain an authentic ma ss following among the working class. But the Social De­ mocratic party has a cloudy historical image. Marxist-Leninist his­ torians must necess arily accord some recog nition to the first mass or­ ganiz ation formally to adopt Marxism as a doc trine, the largest political party in imperial Germany, and the principal vehicle for mediating Ma rxist teachings to the broader world in the period before World War I. On the other hand, these historians find it necessa ry to remain faithful to Lenin's harsh judgments during the last decade of his life of the German Social Democr ats. It remains perplexing even to the non­ Leninist Left that the German Social Democrats failed (I) to take-or even to share-power in imp erial Germany and ( 2) to prevent-or even to resist energetic ally -the German entrance into World War I. The German Social Democrats occup ied a position within German poli­ tics that was as ambiguous as their role in world history. They were neither a revolution ary conspiracy nor a political party operating through an accepted system. They were, instead, a kind of \"non­ participating opposit ion\" 8 within the most powerful state in Europe. Even more than the Second International, which they often dominated but did little to preserve after 1914, the Social Democrats represented a bridge between the Francocentric revolutionary conspiracies of the European era and the mass movements and global politics of the twen­ tieth century. Social Democracy provided a new type of revolutionary leader. He did not att ain power. He rem ained in the wilder ness-but as an organizer rather than a prophet.

The \"Communist party\" about which Marx spoke in the r84os had been more an object of faith than a matter of fact, and he extolled it subsequently not for anything it did, but for its spiritua l essence as the first \"party in the great historical sense.\" There seemed to have been three key charact eristics for such a party : ( r) unity through ideological disciplin e, ( 2) total dedicat ion to the proletariat as a class, and (3) freedom from rest ricting parochial perspecti ves . Marx and En­ gels discovered no such party anywhere during the revolutionary reces­ sion of the r8sos, and never saw more than a potential embodiment in the International Workingmen's Associ ation during its brief history from r864 to 1872. Despite Ma rx's efforts to control and discipline it, this amorphous body never became a \"party\" in this or any other sense. Thus, the party that formed in Germany under the label Social Demo­ cratic was probably the most important political expression of Ma rxism during Marx's lifetime-even if it was largely unconnected with the International and not yet sufficiently disciplined ideologically to be a \"party\" in Marx's \"great historical sense.\" Its name expre ssed its aim of social rather than national revoluti on- and its identity as something more than liberalism and less than communism. Revolutionaries have repeatedly sought to give new vitality to an old label by attaching fresh adjectives to the word democracy. The first youthful communists in the early r84os desc ribed themselves as \"true\" and \"fraternal\" democ rats . Aging Sta linists a centu ry later attempted to refurbish the tarnished communist cause by referring to \"people's\" democra cy,9 democracy \"of a new type,\" 1o or \"na tional\" democracy. 1 1 \"Social\" democracy was the new label of hope for chastened revolu­ tionaries in Germany after 1848, fortifying democracy, the political term for rule of the people, with an adjective suggesting economic jus­ tice as well .12 The term was first invoked by an organized group during the afterm ath of the r 849 uprising in Baden .13 Social democracy be­ came the primary label for the fresh spread of the social revolutionary ideal east of the Rhine in the late nineteenth century, and was gradually linked with Marxism. Lassallean Origins The flamboyant founder of German Social Democracy, Ferdinand Lassalle, seemed an unlikely type to usher in the new age of machine organization. He had dreamt as a youth of leading the German people in battle ; and he assumed at various points in his brief adult career the posture of a poet or philosopher, and the personal demeanor of a brood-"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"37 2 T HE R ISE OF THE S OCIAL R EVOLUTIONARIES ing lover and demagogic orator. His debonair appearance and admir a­ tion for Garibaldi made him an uncongenial person ality for Marx, who once called him (to the embarrassment of Marxist hagiogr aphers ) a \"union of Jew and German on a negro foundation.\" 1 4 Lassa lle had worked with Marx on the Neue Rheinische Zeitung in Cologne during 1848-49, and had developed ideas on revolutionary or­ ganization different from those of the Communist League. Lassa lle's concept of a party was derived not so much from the ideas of Marx's manifesto as from the practices of his newspaper, from what his best biographer calls \"the party of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung .\" 1 5 Lass alle argued that the Communist League failed because it had been held together only by very general ideas which were \"indigestible with­ out educ ation\" and unsuitab le for practical application. The needed mechanism for day-to-day tactical deliberations took place during the editorial discussions of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, where Marx exer­ cised disci pline, while benefiting from critici sm. The result was not the individual dictat orship inherent in the structure of the Communist League, but a collective \"dictatorship of insight\" (Diktatur der Ein­ sicht) 1 6 by a small group struggling through mutual criticism towards an object ive understanding of historical necessity. Lassa lle viewed the failure of Marx's journal to reach a broader audi­ ence during 1848-49 largely as an organizational shortcoming. The Cologne group had simply found no structured way of relating the com­ munist high command to the proletarian army. Lassa lle spelled out his organizational remedy after the collapse of the journal and the subse­ quent flight of Marx from Germany in May 1849. Two new structures were prescribe d; and each was designed simul­ taneously to aid the politic al educat ion of the masses and to provide popular advice and approval for the leadership. First came the periodic \"mass meeting\" (Volksverswmmlung ) where a carefully prepared pro­ gram was presented, and a mass mandate produced for a broad line of strategy to be pursued over a long period of time. Second came a perma­ nent cluster of smaller, popular organizations (of which Lassalle's Peo­ ple's Club in Dussel dorf was a kind of model). They developed limited mandates for specific actions of a tactical and local nature.17 During the 185os, workers' associ ations were outlawed, and Lass alle spent most of his energies writing on legal, economic, and even literary matters. But he continued to correspond with Marx and to procure jour­ nalistic commissions for him-rega rding Marx as an absentee leader who shared his view that the Rhineland would eventu ally become the base for revolutionizing Prussia. Political agitation revived in Germany at the end of the decade, stimulated by the Italian victory over the con­ servative Hapsburg Empire in 1859. The ensuing unification of Italy re­ vived political agitation for German unification. Lassa lle was immedi­ ately plunged into the practical problems of the Prussian political awakenin g, and he found himself in increasing conflict with the more theoretical and global perspectives of Marx in Lond on. They differ ed, first of all, over who was the greatest enemy of the proletariat in the war of 185g-E ngels indicating Napoleon III (who aided Italy); and"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"The Machi ne: German Social Democracy 373 Lassalle, the Hapsburgs. Marx wrote Engels that Lassa lle's intracta bil­ ity on this issue meant that \"we must now absolutely insist on party discipli ne.\" 1 8 But they never found a basis for dialogue let alone disci­ pline. When the new Prussian king decla red a political amnesty early in 1861, Lass alle proposed reviving the Neue Rheinische Zeitung and bringing Marx back to Germany to assume le adership of \"the party.\" But neither Marx's visit to Berlin nor Lassa lle's return trip to London in 1862 succeeded in working out a formula for collaborati on. Nor did Lassa lle gain Marx's approval of his program calling for universal suf­ frage and state aid to producer cooperatives during the national elec­ toral campaign of May 1862. Ma rx criticized Lass alle for his lack of international perspective and his naivete about universal suffrage, which Na poleon III had manipulated into sanctioning a dict atorship . But Lassa lle pressed on, and led the gathering of fourteen repre senta­ tives at L eipzig in May 1863 in forming the All German Workers' Asso­ ciation, \"the first independent national labor organiz ation\" in German history .l9 Lass alle turned to the proletariat not out of affection but out of con­ viction that the German middle class was incapable of cha mpioning popular rule. German liberals had formed a new Progressive part y in 1861, but Lass alle believed them to be paralyzed by \"fear of the peo­ ple\" : Our liberal bourgeoisie cannot smash the military state, cannot win political freedom .2 o Universal suffrage and direct elections were prerequisites to democracy, which liberals no longer sought in their hear ts. Producer cooperatives were needed to lift the workers above subsistence and give them a taste of the \"social democracy\" to come. Arguing that \"the working class must constitute itself as an indepen­ dent political party,\" 2 1 Lass alle incre ased the size of his organiza tion from about four hundred to nearly one thousand by early 1864. 2 2 Lassa lle rejected Ma rx's counsel of making common cause with the numerically stronger liberals, and he gave the German working class an orientation towards sel f-conscious separ ation from the rest of so­ ciety which never basica lly changed. Intellectuals who applied for mem­ bership in a local branch of Lass alle's new organization had to be cle ared by party headq uarters. The adjective geschlossene, which many Lass alleans attached to the word working class , meant closed as well as united.23 The Social Democratic party emerged from these sm all beginnin gs, rallying the primarily Protestant ranks of the working class. In the pro­ cess of achieving \"self-isol ation\" and \"negative integration\" 2 4 into the imperial German state, the Social Democrats unconsciously internalized to some extent not just the milita ry discipline of the state it opposed, but also its grow ing bureaucratic mentality.

For, whether or not German Social Democracy was \"crip­ pled from birth,\" it was cle arly haunted from the cradle by the looming presence of Otto von Bismarck. His long dominance of German political life began when he was summoned to become minister-pr esident of Prussia during the constitutional crisis of September 1862. Viewing the work ing-class movement as a tactical ally in his struggle with the libera ls, Bisma rck sought out Lass alle to discuss the latter's proposal for universal suffrage as a possible means of strengthening the mon­ archy. Bisma rck also commissioned a conservative journalist to exam­ ine the questions of workers' benefits raised in Lass alle's program-old age insurance and state regul ation of factory condition s-a nd to draw up proposed socia l legislat ion for the workers (it was vetoed by the liberals ).25 Lass alle, from his side, saw opportunities for the German working class in Bismarck's struggle with the liberal propertied classes. The working class could tactically use the power of Bismarck's state to dis­ possess the liberals and set up producer cooperative s. The latter would provide the economic base (and universal suffrage the political vehic le) for an eventual takeover of the central state by the organized party of the working class. Marx, who objected at this time to Lassa lle's concept of interim cooperation with the Prussian state, was himself lat er to be accused of \"Bism arxi sm .\" 2a Thus the early hist ory of German Social Democracy is closely linked to the efforts of the Iron Chance llor al­ ternately to manipulate, to coopt, or to suppress his stead ily growing opposit ion on the Left. Lassa lle did not live to see the process unfold . He died in a duel over an ari stocratic woman's honor in August 1864, just a few weeks before the founding of the First Internation al. He died like a romantic figure of a bygone era-but had spoken in some ways like a prophet of the distant future. His demagogic addresses to mass audiences (\"the all­ des troying power of human speech\" ) 27 and his admiration for Bis­ ma rck (\"a man\" as distinct from the \"old women\" liberal politici ans ) 28 prefigured in a way the later German fascinat ion with the radio voice and aggressive mascu linity of Na tional Social ism . Efforts at organization in the Lass allean tradition were built around a journal : first the Ha mburg Nordstern, then the Berlin Sozial-Demokrat, founded in December 1864. Its editor, Johann Baptist von Schweitzer, succeeded Lass alle as head of the All German Workers' Associ ation and soon described the new journal as the \"Organ of the Social Democratic Party.\" 29 Schweitzer popula rized Lass alle's argument with Marx through a serialized novel, which showed liberals deceiving the work­ ers by inciting them to overthrow feudal governments and then taking over political power and exploiting the workers even more ruthlessly. 3 0 Marx reacted to Schweitzer even more angrily than to Lass alle , break­ ing relations altogether early in I 865 for three years. Ma rx gave the proletarian Social Democratic organiz ation the disparaging label of sect while the nonrevolutionary, bourgeois Volkspartei was called a party, since it supported Marx's call for resisting Prussian control of a uni­ fied Ger many.31"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"The Machi ne: German Social Democracy 37 5 But the middle-class liberals whom Marx first saw as allies were im­ mobilized by Bismarck's spectacula r military victory over the Ha ps­ burgs in I866. For fresh hope Ma rx turned to a second worki ng-class party less attached to Bismarck's Prussia than the Lass alle-Schweitzer organizati on : an amalgam of workers and intellectuals that formed the Social Democratic Work ingmen's party at Eisenach in I86g. The leading \"Eisenachers ,\" Wilhelm Liebknecht and Johann Philipp Becker, were Ma rx's closest German friends, and like him were cosmo­ polit an , multi-lingual intellectuals forc ed into exile after the failure of revolution in I848-so. They had both been far more active mil itants than Marx, having fought in the armed uprising of I849 in Ba den. Becker remained in Switzerland throughout the I 86os and became the guiding force behind Vorbote, an official journal of the First Interna­ tional which began to appear in Janua ry 1866.22 Liebkn echt, Marx's closest German protege in London in the I85os, became his most ef­ fective supporter within Germany after returning in 1862. He collabo­ rated closely with the woodworker and orator August Bebel. They were both elected to the North German Diet in I867, reaffirming the need for a tactical alliance with what remained of the liberal opposition to Bismarck. Liebknecht and Bebel acquired an aura of heroism by resisting the Franco-Prussian war, converting into prop aganda plat forms first their seats in the Reich stag and then their positions as defendants in the Leipzig trial of I872. The Eisenachers alone were formally linked to the First Internati onal ; and they developed a number of procedures that were to become sta ndard in mass revolutionary organization : a ritual of formal expulsion and (after their congress of I 873) an insistence that party members cannot concurrently hold positions in another political organization . aa Thus, despite their inferiority in numbe rs to the Lassalleans, the Eisenachers brought disproportionate strength to the merger between the two groups organized at Gotha in I875· The seeming victory of the Lassa lleans at that time, signified by the acceptance in the program of unification of the Prussian state as the framework for socialist develop­ ment and of producer cooperatives as the means for distributing wealth to the worke rs, drove Marx to strong denunciati on. He wrote his last gre at theoretical tract on the link between communism and revoluti on : his Critique of the Gotha Program . He decried the \"vulgar socialism\" involved in seeking distributive just ice through any existing state mechanism. For the second (and last ) time in his writ ings, he articul ated the need for a \"dictatorship of the proletar iat.\" The existing bourgeois state, he reminded his German readers, must be destroyed altogether by revolution, and the means of production seized by the proletar iat. Only after this event-when a new inte rim form of class dictat orship has been established-could social justice be achieved and oppressive political power beg in to \"wither away.\" Dictat orship would wither away because it would lack any roots in class oppression.

Marx deferred all hope for dist ributive just ice to the second, \"higher phase\" of the coming com­ munist society. Then alone would society be ruled by the law : \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.\" 34 Marx from afar could not provide leade rship for German Social Democracy. But Marxism as an ideology did begin to make a decisive impact after Engels's Anti-Dii hring began to appear throughout 1877-78 in Vorwiirts, the official journal of the new united party. Like other lead­ ing Marxist texts, this affirmation of doctrine took the form of a blister­ ing attack on a rival. Eugen Diihring was a prolific and iconoclastic teacher at Berlin University, who argued in essence that Marx's preoc­ cup ation with economic laws was blunting the healthy pas sion for poli­ tical revolution in Germany. In counterattacking with gusto this idol of radical Berlin , Engels wrote the first popular exposition of Ma rxism as a coherent revolutionary doc trine ; it has remained the most widely re­ printed work by Marx and Engels after the Communist Manifesto.35 Engels's work was initially denounced, in part out of political sympat hy for Diihring who had been dismissed from the university . But the work deeply impressed the new emerging leaders of Social Democra cy: young Karl Kautsky and Edua rd Bernstein as well as Liebknecht and Bebel. Growing popular acceptance of the Engels tract was a major milestone on the path towards the formal adoption of Marxism as the official ideology of the German Social Democratic party. The polemic posture of Anti-Dii hring transformed Marx's image in Germany-even for those who could not understand his ideas. For the first time Marx appeared cle arly to be defending the working class and its economic concerns against the abstractions of a prof essor. En­ gels helped free Marx from the cha rge of excessive intellectu alism by leveling the same charge against Diihrin g. Marx's followers soon broad­ ened the attack against \"the socialism of prof essors\" ( Kathedersozialis­ mus) generally. Marx annexed the rival's role, however, even while de­ nouncing his person. He gained the position of pedagogu e-in-chief to the revolutionary movem ent, transf err ing the locus of quasi-ecclesiastical auth ority for the working classes from political tea ching pronounced in Berlin University to economic science derived from the British Mu­ seum. His largely unread Capital became a greater source of authority than the complete works of Diihrin g. The discov ery of Ma rxism oc­ curred just on the eve of the twelve-year period of antisocialist res tric­ tions that began in 1878. Marxist reassu rances that revolution was ulti­ mately determined by economic laws and not political activists fortified the Social Democrats against the discouragement that might otherwise have descended on a movement that was now suddenly forbidden to hold any meetings or to continue any publications outside the Rei chstag. The Social Democrats had stead ily incre ased their strength from two Reich stag seats in the elections of 1871 to nine in 1874 and twelve in 18 77.

During this period, Bisma rck revived his earlier interest in social legisl ation for the workers-providing insurance and retirement benefits in an ef­ fort to undercut the Social Democratic hold over the proletariat. The reorganized German political police in Berlin received during the period of rest rictions some 18,ooo reports from agents assigned to cover the revolutionary agitation in which the Social Democrats were presumed to be leaders .36 This persecution, albeit lim ited, helped purge the party of any Las­ sallea n illusions about working through the sta te. Organizational work continued among the proletariat under Bebel's leadership. Earlier at­ tempts to use intellectual journals as the basis for organization gave way to a growing network of social and fraternal bodies for working people that closely paralleled those which the churches had traditionally provided. Women' s, youth, and sporting organizations appeared under Social Democratic auspice s-a nd served as vehicles for both recruit­ ment into the party and outwa rd dissemination of its propaganda. At their Copenhagen Congress in 1883, the Social Democrats professed to entertain \"no illusions\" of obtaining progress through parliament s. Writing to Bebel the following year, Engels hailed \"the party\" as a kind of army : as the \"general sta ff\" and the first mass Marxist organization on a national basis .37 The party continued to grow : from 30o,ooo votes netting twelve Rei chstag seats in 1881 to twenty-four seats in 1884 and thirty-five in 18go, when the party polled nea rly one and a half million votes- about one- fifth of the total .38 The following year, at Erfurt, during the first congress held after the fall of Bisma rck and the repeal of the antisocialist laws , the party formally declared itself to be Marxist with the blessing of the aged Engels and of his young protege in London, Karl Kautsky.

He never held a formal political position in either the party or the parliament, and his turgid prose was unintelligible to many ordinary workers . His tendency to find guidance in Marx for almost everything was so single-minded that a colleague once said : \"Kautsky would always feel he had to dem­ onstrate that Marx even wet his diapers in an orthodox way.\" 3 9 His long apprenticeship with Engels in London and his role as literary caret aker of Marx's and Engels's papers suggested that he was a kind of apostolic success or to the founders .

It combined the old concept of revolutionary guidance from a central journal with the new function of defining Marxist positions on philosophical and cultural as well as political questions. Kautsky brought to his task a truly international backgr ound : a Czech father, a German mother, with both Italian and Sla vic ancestors , a Viennese edu­ cation, long residence in England. He fortified his party with the Marxist assurance that proletarian revolution was inevitable and could \"neither be hastened nor delayed .\" 40 The Social Democrats were \"a revolu­ tion ary party, but not a party which makes revolution .\" 41 In a lett er to Marx's biographer in 1893, Kautsky suggested that Marx's \"Dict ator­ ship of the Prolet ariat\" could be realized by an Englis h-type parliament with a Social Democratic ma jority.4 2 He pioneered the tradition of defining a Marxist party line in a center bet ween Right and Left deviatio ns.43 His influence grew internationally, as the German party inspired imitators els ewhere and increasingly dominated the Second International during the decade after its founding in 1889. Kautsky's ped agogic role was imitated by the founding fathers of the Social Democratic movements which soon arose in the two conse rvative multinational empires of eastern Eur ope : Victor Adler in Hapsburg Austria and George Plekhanov in Romanov Russia. 44 Adler like Kautsky had a partially Czech background, a Viennese edu­ cation, and a close personal relationship with Enge ls. A medical doctor and an urbane intel lectual, he led the Austrian party after its non­ ideological founding in 1874 until the time in 1889 when he succeeded in inviting Kautsky to draft a purely Marxist program committing the party to the seizure of political power. The Aust rian party in turn in­ fluenced the work ing-class movements of other leading nat ional ities of the Hapsbu rg Empire : notably the Hunga rians and the Czechs. The tendency of Social Democratic groups to relate in a federative rather than a subordinate ma nner to the Aus trian party led in I 895 to the first use of the term \"national socialism.\" 45 Plekhanov published in Geneva in 1882 the first Russian translation of the Communist Manifesto. The following year he formed the first Rus­ sian Marxist group , the \"Liberation of Labor,\" and published Socialism and the Political Struggle, the first of the ideological treatises that made him rival Kautsky as the leading theoretician of international Marxism . The development of Social Democracy within Russia was to occur later; but during the decade from 1885 to 1894, Social Demo­ cratic parties on the German model were also founded in Belg ium , Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, and Holland. In the midst of this peri od, the Second International was founded in Paris on the centena ry of the storming of the Bastille.

Only at the fourth congress (London, I896) were an archis ts, syndicalis ts, and other anticentralizers decisively rebuffed by the creation of a central organizat ion and the requirement that members accept the need for political action (im plicitly on the German Social Democrat ic model ). At the next conference (Paris, I9oo ), the German organizational _model was drawn upon further with the establishment of a perm anent, paid secretar iat : the Internat ional Socialist Bureau in Brussels. This central body lacked the strong personal leade rship that Marx had provided through the General Council of the First International and the fifty to seventy members of the council of the bureau held only four meet ings a year; but the pretension of paragovernmental authority was unmistak­ able. The executive committee of the bureau prepared for and executed commands from the congr esses, which were henc eforth formally named Internationa l Socialist Congr ess es; their designated purpose was \"to be­ come the Parliament of the Proletar iat,\" whose resolutions would \"guide the proletariat in the struggle for deliver ance.\" 47 Effective leadersh ip in the Second International was exercised more by the German Social Democratic party than by the council of the bu­ reau or by the Brussels secretariat. Party caucuses produced a generally unified German posi tion in advance of the congresses of the Interna­ tional. The Paris Congress of I900 and the Amsterdam Congress of I904 were each preceded by a German party Congress (at Ha nover in I 899 and Dresden in I903). The Amsterdam Congress of the Internat ional in August I904 repre­ sented \"the highest point in the influence of the International\" 4 8 and perhaps the high point as well of German control. Kautsky's formula­ tions calling for a recommitment to class struggle and to the revolu­ tionary use of parliamentary power were forced through the congress by a disciplined German delegat ion backed by the prestige of electoral success in winning eighty-one seats and three million votes in I903. The next congr ess, in I907, was the first ever held in Germ any; and the German Social Democrats had the largest group ( 289) within the largest total deleg ation ( 886) ever to appe ar at a congress of the Inter­ national.

This was the battle that Liebknecht and Bebel had fought against Proudhonist ideas within Germany in the r87os; and that Jules Guesde concurrently waged less successfully in France. Guesde established in r877 the first Marxist weekly, Egalite, and defined in r87g-8o the first Marxist program for France. The same basic conflict spread to Russia, beginning with Plekhanov's call of r883 to subst itute a Social Demo­ cratic program for the antipolitical Proudhonist tradition of Russian populi sm.5 1 Engels's final blessing on the German model was contained in his last major work before his death : a new preface in r 895 to Marx's Class Struggles in France. Engels modified if he did not \"revise\" the semi­ Blanquist tone of Marx's classic, suggesting elections rather than in­ surrections as the path to power. Steady gains in general elections gave the German Social Democrats \"a special position ... a special task\" as \"the decisive 'shock force' of the international proleta rian army.\" 52 Kautsk y became the custodian and perpetuator of Engels's evolution­ ist and determinist optimism in interpreting the Marxist herit age.53 The German model of Social Democracy seemed to be on the road to vin­ dication in the period leading up to World War I. Organizational activ­ ity grew rapidly in a sub-culture that included cooper ative stores, chess clubs, and even burial societ ies. The number of leaflets incre ased in the space of one year ( rgrr-r2) from 33·5 million to II4 million 54 after the elections of rgr2, and leadership in effect passed to the parlia­ mentary group of the party that was composed largely of authentic worke rs. The German working class was more numero us, better educated, and superior in professional status to that of France or Russia. It created not just an effective political machine, but also the appealing image of \"a global counter-society ready to subst itute itself for the established society.\" It kept hope alive at two levels with \"its double ambition to be something right away and to be everything when the moment comes.\" 55 But the moment never came. Indeed, the German tide may have crested as early as the Stuttga rt Congress in rgo7. Internal organiza­ tional activity subsequently acquired a life and logic of its own. Pre­ ambles to executive reports at party gatherings came to resemble state pronounc emen ts; financial statements acquired the solemnity of gov­ ernmental budgets ; and annual congresses required weeks of prepara­ tion and grew to four days in length .56 The revolutionary impulse simply drowned in an ocean of bureaucracy.

They had helped secure in rgo7 international pro­ letarian opposition to national wars (either \"by parliament ary or by social action\" ).

The latter was deepl y and permanently influenced by the way the German party at the tum of the centu ry overcame the growing demand within it to substitute reform for revolution . A pragmatic, piecemeal strategy seemed to be only an extensi on of the basic decision to concentrate Socia l Democrat ic efforts on gains in the parliament. There was added appeal in the seeming trend towards reformism within France and England. This German \"struggle against revisionism\" dominated the revolution ary imagination in c·entral and eas tern Europe during the period between the tiny first congress of the Russian Social Democratic party in I 8g8 and the large second congress in which the party as a whole and the Leninist Bolshevik wing were both born. Kautsky popularized the theoretical term revisionism to denounce those who \"revised\" Marx's teachings into evolution ary refor mism. Kaut­ sky succes sfully isolated, labeled, and denounced as an ism something that had hitherto existed only as tendency .58 In a bold dep arture from revolutionary orthodoxy during an electoral banquet of 18g6, a leading F rench socialist, Alexandre Millerand had argued that capita lism could now be effectively supplanted by par­ tial nat ionalization and municipalization of the means of production. Such a strategy necess arily involved political collaboration with radicals and liberals in the assembly against monopoly con trol of the econ ­ omy .59 Banquets, which had led men to the barricades fifty years ear ­ lier, now led them to the ballot box. Electoral gains in May 18g8, combined with the threat from the Right during the Dreyfus Affair to cause a prime minister to invite Millerand in 18gg to become minister of trade and indust ry in his new gover nment.

The moderate reformist impulse was strengthened throughout the la­ bor movement by the formation in 1902-03 of an International Sec­ retariat of National Trade Union Centers. 6 I The eleven countries repre­ sented were largely the Protestant countries of northwestern Europe where revolutionary traditions were almost nonex istent; and the con­ trolling force in both the permanent secretariat and the biennial inter­ national conferences tended to be the moderate wing of the German Social Democratic movement. Independent international influence was exercised by the even-less revolutionary trade union movement of Great Britain. This growing movement swamped the weak Marxist Social Dem­ ocratic Federation in England, which had briefly sought to provide revolutionary leadership for the labor unre st of the late 188os. British unions were enticed by incremen talism, and unlike their German coun­ terparts were creators (not creati ons) of a political party. The British elected labor delegates to parliament first as a bloc within the Liberal party in 1886 and 1892, and then formed the Independent Labor party in 1893. The success of the British unions in enacting progressive legisla­ tion encouraged others to consider the advantages of a unionism that was wage conscious rather than class conscious, interested primarily in collec­ tive bargaining, and non-socialist, if not anti-socialist .6 2 Optimism within the working class about evolutionary social progress was para lleled by growing socialist conviction among upper-class intel­ lectuals. The Fabian Society founded in r883 played a catalytic role, preaching the \"inevitability of gradualness\" in the movement towards a socialist society. Taking their name from the Roman warrior Fabi us, who learned to wait patiently before striking a fatal blow against Han­ nibal, the Fabians were less doctrinaire in their reliance on the masses than the Social Democrats. They feared that \"the revolt of the empty stomach ends at the baker's shop.\" 6 3 They rejected not just revolu­ tionary tactics, but also the concept of class struggle, arguing in effect that the conflict between bourgeois and proletarian might produce industrial un­ rest; it would not produce socialism. 6 4 The Fabians saw themselves \"permeating\" all elements of English so­ ciety with the rationality of socialism .

German Social Democ­ racy became less democrat ic in the process of rejecting Bernstein­ and, perhaps more suitable thereby for later adoption in authoritarian lands further east. Bernstein was one of fifteen children of a poor Jewish plumber in Berlin. A brilliant student and writer, he had since r88r edited the official party newspaper Der Sozialdemokrat, and was close to Engels during his long exile in London. Beginning with articles in r8g6 and ending in the publication of his Evolutionary Socialism in r8gg, Bern­ stein argued forcefully that Marx's teachings required systematic revi­ sion in the light of economic developments since his death. He argued that a capitalist collapse was not inevitable, and a catastrophic revolu­ tion increasingly impr obable. Wealth was in some ways being spread (rather than concentrated in ever fewer hands ) under the capitalist sys­ tem, and class distinctions blurred (rather than ever more sharply polarized ). He argued that the Social Democrat ic party could substan­ tially increase its influence if it could find the courage to free itself from outmoded phraseology and strive to appear as what in fact it now is, a Democratic Socialist party of reform . oG Bernstein returned to Germany in rgor after twenty years of en­ forced exile and was elected to the Reichstag the following year. He gained considerable support within the trade union movement and in south Germany, where Social Democrats were already active in local govern ment. He proposed that the German Social Democrats follow, in effect, the Millerand precedent by insisting on the vice-presidency of the Reichstag and thus participating in the formal exercise of govern­ ment power. But this suggestion and the evolution ary reformism be­ hind it were decisively rejected at the Dresden conference of the party in 1903, and at the Amsterdam Congress of the Second International the following year. Berns tein had brought to Germany the view widely expounded thro ughout the European Left that capitalist society might \"grow into socialism without a violent revoluti on.\" Yet the argument seemed more appropriate to England than to Germany, where the executive was not finally responsible to the Reichstag. Behind the imperial executive in Germany, moreover , stood the antidemocratic and antisocialist force of military and Junker power. Finally, and not least import ant, was the long attachment of Social Democrats to the consoling myth of a coming revolution which had susta ined them during the long period of the antisocialist laws. They could not bring themselves to abandon the idea in theory-even if they did in practice . Thus, revisionism was stamped out as a threat to the revolutionary faith. As Liebknecht put it to Bernstein at the onset of the controve rsy: Islam was invincible as long as it believed in itself ....

He guarded the faith intact and kept the believers united with his interpretation of the Koran of Social Democracy, Capital. But unlike Mohammed, he was not to be \"the seal of the proph ets.\" For it was in Russia, not Germany that revolution first broke out in the twentieth century ( 1905), and that social revolutionaries eventua lly came to power ( 1917). The Marxist mantle of doctrinal infallibility passed thereafter to the leader of that revolution, V. I. Lenin, who anathemized Kautsky in much the same way that Kautsky had condemned Bernstein twenty years earlier in his The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky, written late in 1918 on the eve of the First Congress of the Third International. Before turning from Germany to Russia, one must ask the nagging questions always posed about the German Social Democ rats. Why did they not attain-o r more aggressively seek-power? Why did they be­ come so preoccupied with parliament ary electio ns? How could they end up supporting the patriotic rush to war in 1914 -providing in effect proletarian cannon fodder for the bourgeois state they were theoreti­ cally pledged to overthr ow? Much of the Social Democrats' \"failure\" can be attributed to adverse outside force s. They had the misfortune to be a revolution ary move­ ment in a nonrevolutionary age. The enormous concentration of phys­ ical power in the new industrial state of the late nineteenth century rendered spontaneous, internally generated revolution all but impossi­ ble. Even in combustible Paris by 1870-71, a foreign power had to smash the existing state machine before a revolution could occur. But part of the explanation for the Social Democratic \"failure\" lies in the nature of the movement itself. As we have seen, it conceived of power in an altogether different way from the revolutiona ry move­ ments of an earlier era, the difference described earlier as the shift from a Masonic to a machine model of revolutionary organization. The Masonic models of the Francocentric era had conceived of power in architectural terms as the enclosure of space by a structure : 6 i lo­ cating legitimacy within an inner lodge or circle ; revalidating politics through the structure of a constituted assembly rather than the body of an anointed monarch ; liberating others by enclosure within a grande nation; ultimately seeking to \"make the world a pantheon .\" G s But the new German state even more than the Third Republic in France had simply coopted for conservative ends these images of the na­ tional revolutionary era. The \"springtime of nations\" had given way to the long hot summer of industrial unrest and imperial expansion . The new machine model of the German Social Democrats expressed the replacement of national by social revolutionary ideals. The Germans drew from the machine the image of power as the dy­ namic development of material force in time, rather than the progres­ sive conquest of segments of space through moral heroism. The Social Democratic party was not the expression of some philosophical-moral ideal. It was a material, political instrument of the working class.

Ger­ man Social Democracy, therefore, saw its avenue to power in a political strategy that developed over time rather than in para-military efforts to \"liberate\" oppressed areas. The object of revolutionary strategy was to gain control over the means of production which were widely dispe rsed, not to seize directly the concentrated political power of the state. The success of the Social Democratic party as a politic al machine gave it a vested interest in the very national state within which its power was increasing. Having lost the sense that earlier revolutionaries had of a separate identity, a fraternal conspiracy anchored in its own sa cred space, the new mass organization was unable to preserve its distinctiveness from the estab lished political system. Most important of all, the Social Democr ats-l ike most other political organizations in the long period of peace and progress prior to World War !-la cked that sense of prophetic foreboding that alone could have prepared them for what was to come. Germany was particularly re­ moved from violence during this period; it was perhaps the most in­ ternally tranquil country in Europe for the quarter of a century prior to 1914.69 Possibly only those who lived more intimately with violence could sense the coming of total global war. Violence in Germany on the eve of World War I still lay sheathed within the machines of a disciplined state. Further to the east, violence was less easily confined and con­ trolled. The first major war of the twentieth century, the Russo­ Japanese conflict of 1904-05, led directly to revolution in Russia in 1905. And when violent war came again in 1914 , Russian Social Democrats proved more prepared than their German counterparts to move boldly. The Germ ans, having lost the older dependence on moral heroism, were thus unable to muster the courage to resist the rush to war in 1914. In Russi a, however, where violence was centra l to the revolu­ tionary tradition , a revolutionary Social Democratic opposition to the war developed on a semiprophetic basis. Vladimir Lenin foresaw the flame of a coming revolution when others saw only the smoke of war.

But that fire continued to smolder undergro und, and burst out into three revolutionary conflagrations in the early twentieth century. During the second half of the nineteenth century, Russia and social­ ism replaced Poland and nationalism as the main revolutiona ry force in eastern Europ e. Then, in 1917 , the social revolutionary tradition was to come to power in Russia, producing the first decisive break in the ideological unity of European civilization since the Protestant Reform ation.

The importance of Russia to the world lies not just in the material victory of the Bolshevik Revolution but also in the prior spiritual con­ quest within Russia of a highly cerebral and uniquely intense variant of the European revolutionary tradition. Indeed, the transformation of the old Russian Empire into the new Union of Soviet Socialist Republics resembled in some respects the transformation of the Roman Empire from paga nism into Christianit y under Constantine the Great in the fourth century A.D. The imperatives for the change arose not just from the practical problems of an aging empire , but also, more deeply, from its loss of ideological legitimacy. The origins of the turn to a new belief by an old empire must, in both cases , be sought in the long years of preachin g, martyrdom, and quiet conversion to the new faith within the realm of the old. Just as the Constant inian Revolution orig­ inated in the underground history of a previously illicit faith, so the Bolshevik Revolution \"began\" with the development within Russia of the most totalistic branch of the European revolutionary faith. There was a dark side to this distinctiven ess. For the Russians may be said to have unlocked the secrets of violen ce-just as the Germans uncovered those of organization. If the machine symbolized the German revolutionary movement, the bomb symbolized the Russian. The ex­ plosive implement was no less a product of the new industrial technology than was the implosive machine, but the bomb was more radically democratic (anyone could make and have access to one) and more directly terrif ying.l The Russian fascination with explosives dates back to the early Mus­ covite tsars, 2 but was intensified by the western economic expansion of the late nineteenth century. In search of minerals and fuels to feed its expanding industrial production, western Europe explored Russia and other outlying regions with the aid of new blasting materials. The Swedish inventor of dynamite, Alfred Nobel, conducted much of his early work in St. Petersburg and established by the turn of the century the largest oil fields in the world at Baku.3 From Nobel's first underwater detonation of dynamite in 1862 through the perfecting of nitroglycerine compounds in the early 187os, Europe was presented with powerful new explosives equally suitable for blast­ ing minerals or killing people . The explosives exercised a certain scien­ tific fascination for the new radical student generation, since chem­ istry seemed to be one of the least romantic and most materially useful forms of science. Chernyshevsky justified the new revolutionary as­ ceticism with a chemical metaphor. The warmth people need came not from sentimentality, but from a cold match striking the hard surface of social reality and lighting thereby a fire. Revolutionary students de­ veloped an almost sacramental reverence for chemical mixtur es. Dmi­ try Mendeleev, who wrote his Principles of Chemist ry and codified the periodic table in St .

The supreme revolutionary organization of the era, the People's Will, ended the reign of Alexander II with a rain of bombs. It is a haunting fact that the People's Will revealed neither its name nor its program until November 1879-after the first bomb had exploded in a first attempt to assassinate Alexander IJ.5 The regicidal explosion was thus the organization's first public statement; and when one of its leaders was arrested, extraordinary attention was devoted to analyzing the sev­ enteen kilograms of dynamite discovered upon him. The experts gloom­ ily concluded that the explosive was an original, high quality com­ pound made inside Russia and easily replic ated. 6 In its final plans for the successful assassination of the tsar on March I, 1881, the People's Will attached special importance to the bomb even while recognizing that shooting might be cheaper and surer : It would not have created such an impression. It would have been seen as an ordinary murder, and thus would not have expressed a new stage in the revolutionary move ment.7 The Russian tradition did indeed express a \"new stage in the revolu­ tionary movemen t.\" The assembling of bombs became a commun ally unifying force no less important than the printing of leaflets in the revolutionary cell. The dynamite workshop ( masterskaia) which the People's Will first formed in the late seventies reappeared in the stu­ dent group of Lenin's older brother in the late eighti es-a nd then again in the \"technical bureau\" of Lenin's own Bolshevik party and other such groups prolif erating throughout Russia at the turn of the century.8 The Russian tradition first acquired distinctive shape in the 186os amidst the raised expectations of Alexander II's reform period. As we know, Herzen, the leader of the first Russian revolutionary organiza­ tion, Land and Liberty, had for nearly a decade been close to such na­ tional revolutionaries as Lelewel, Worcell, Mazzini, and Fazy in Geneva. During the period of Alexander's reign, Herzen had even entertained the classical Italo-Polish hope of realizing a constitutional monarchy through \"reform from above.\" Yet hardly had Herzen begun to organize from London a conspiracy to achieve this than his leadership was rejected by Chernyshevsky and the \"new men\" of the 186os within Russia. By 1863, the It alo-Polish tradition had been in effect supplanted in Russia by the more violent ideology of a new generat ion. The intensity of its quarrel with the older generation (like that of Baza rov with his elders in Turgenev's Fathers and Sons of 1862) heralded something profoundly new. The new Russian tradition which emerged in the 186os can be ana­ lyzed in terms of five evocative words central to it : nihilism, intelli-"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"The Bomb: Russian Violence gentsia, populism, terrorism, and anarchism. Each word had been used before elsewhere, but acquired through Russian usage both a new meaning and a new world-wide currency. Taken together the five terms suggest uncompromisin g, total opposition to the status quo. They may be said to have replaced in practice (even as they pretended to serve in theory ) the revolutionary idea of the earlier, Francocentric period : liberty, equality, and fraternity. The Slogans of the Sixties Nihilism Youth movements begin with a \"revolution of rising expect ation\" dur­ ing an age of political reform. The original revolutionary student move­ ment had arisen in Germany a half centur y earlier out of hopes raised by the reforms in Prussia. American student revolts a century later were to grow out of the renewed sense of political possibility generated by the Kennedy era and the civil-ri ghts movement. In like manner, exaggerated youthful expectations of change under Alexander II led­ perhaps inevitably-to disillusionmen t deepening into despa ir once his reforms came to be seen as partial and incomplete. The sense of being a unique gener ation usua lly feeds not only on exaggerated expectations of reform, but also on identific ation with a political leader who seems to represent a charismatic agent of change. Perhaps the first self-conscious student generat ion in revolt were the Sturm und Drang poets and pamphleteers of the 1770s in Germany. Their glorification of the will in opposit ion to convention was in many ways subtly shaped by the model of Frederick the Great, who defied both Prussian tradition and the European balance of power. The orig­ inal revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century were young officers and students whose imag ination had been aroused by Napoleon; and he continued to inspire romantic rebels throughout the century. Mazzini's Young Italy and Young Europe introduced in the early 183os the romantic notion that youth as such should rebel against what Fazy called \"geront ocracy.\" Once again, hopes were raised (by the Revolu­ tion of I 830) only to be dashed by the failure of revolution to spread, and by the subsequent return in Belgium and France of \"revolution­ ary\" new mon archs to cons ervative ways. The vitalistic idea that the young generation itself should complete an artificially arrested reform program kept revolutionary enthusiasm alive among Poles and Italians during the \"springtime of nations\" leading up to 1848.

Total ne­ gation was born in part out of disgust with the incompetence of old Russia that had led to humiliating defeat during the Crim ean War, and in part out of long-repre ssed resentment against the pretension and antirationalism of Romanov Russia. The uniqueness of Russia had been asserted with extravagant pride in the doctrine of official nationality in 1833 and identified with social conse rvatism as Russia crushed revolutions in Poland of 1831 and in Hunga ry of 1849. After defeat in the Crimea, young people wanted to end this attitude of acceptance, and the term nihilist was invented and popular ized in Turgenev's Fa­ thers and Sons of 1862 to char acterize the new negat ivism that pro­ claimed \"two plus two is four and all else is nonsense . \" 1 0 This extreme rejection of existing tradition was confined almost ex­ clusively to the student population. As in Prussia of the I8Io s, a gov­ ernment bent on reform after defeat in war suddenly opened up edu­ cational opportunities and sought to organize the expanding student popul ation into traditional regional groupin gs. The Russian zemlia­ chestva was a literal translation of the earlier German Landsmann­ schaften (and a direct borrowing from the Karporationen organizations at Dorpat, the German-speaking university within the Russian Empire ). But just as the German students formed their own anti-aristocra tic and antitraditional Burschensc haften, so the Russian students in the late 185os developed their own more democratic groupings which met to define and defend student rights : the skhodki, named after the label used for traditional peasant assemblies .11 The sense of unlimited pos­ sibility generated in these gatherings contrasted sharply with the squa lid conditions in which the students were forced to live. The Rus­ sian student popul ation nearly doubled in the six years that followed the sanctioning of unlimited university enrollment in 1855, and many of the student complaints about Russian society as a whole were in some cases projections of their own grievances against the cramp ed conditions of Russian student life. Much of the subsequent behavior of radical Russian students followed the earlier pattern of German students during the revolutions of 1848- 49 : the printing of journals, the founding of \"free academies,\" the at­ tempts to recruit army support (successfully in Baden in the summer of I 849), and the heroic efforts to rescue their ideological heroes from prison (such as the escape of Johann Kinkel from the Spandau prison engineered by the twent y-year-old Karl Schurz ). 1 2 The term nihilist had been popularized in Karl Gutzkow's tale of 1853, Die Nihilisten, to char­ acterize the materialism of the German students in the disillusioned aftermath of 1848. Young Russians eagerly absorbed the materialism of German writers of the 1850s like Buchner and Molleschott, often fortifying their new convictions with theological intensity derived from seminary back­ grounds.

But frustrated radicals in Russia never had a chance to rise in 1848. Further frustrated by the repression of Nicholas I's last years, they felt a new sense of possi­ bility with the advent of a new tsar in 1855· Thus, young Russia developed a subculture of intense expectation that never tired of attempts to free politic al prisoners. Unlike Germans who went to Amer­ ica, Russians sent to Siberia never lost faith in a coming revolution. The totalistic quality of the Russian revolutionary tradition owed much to the authoritarian nature of the tsarist system. Never had the interdependence between the extremes of Right and Left been more evident than in late imperial Russia, where the liberal reformism of Alexander II's early years was undermined by both terror on the Left and coun ter-terror from the Right. Revolutionary populism vied with and intermixed with reactionary pan-Slavism in the 187os; the assass i­ nations on the Left that climaxed in the killing of Alexander II were followed by pogroms of the Right under Alexander III. Revolutionaries and police not only studied but interpenetrated one another's activities so deeply that it was sometimes impossible to disentan gle an indi­ vidual's real allegiance. The deepest roots of revolutionary totalism in Russia, however, per­ haps lay in the student subcu lture and its rituals of togethern ess. The decisive element was not just the political activation of nona ristocr atic students ,13 but also the development within the elite educ ational in­ stitutions of a \"two-track pattern of educ ational promotion, with one path leading to political revolt.\" 1 4 This path first appeared within the Aleks androvsky Lyceum in the I84os, then within the university in the late 185os and the early 186os, and finally within the technical schools (the Medical-Surgical Acade my and the Technological Institute ) as they assumed more importance in the late 186os and the early 187os. These highly select ive institutions of the Russian government provided automatic advancement into the imperial state; but in the 186os they also became \"a crucible for the tempering of radical revolt among students for whom social origins had lost real meaning.\" 1 5 In the impersonal capital of St. Petersbur g, a city built for parades rather than people, the university population had more than doubled from 1855 to 185g.l6 This swollen student popula­ tion was cut off from its parochial and patriarchal past and infected simultaneously with the political ambition of imperial St. Petersburg and the intellectual vistas of a European university. The students thus combined \"elitist attitudes and egalitarian habits.\" 17 They developed an intense communal life built around librar ies, mutual aid funds, lithographed publication s, and even (with the active help in 186o of the university law faculty ) student courts.

Student life in its early, apolitical phase already contained the germs of a social alternative to the tsarist order. The skhodki provided a kind of legislature; the commune (obshchina) a kind of judiciary ; the cooperative ( artel) a productive enterprise based on distributive economic justice. Their discussion groups for them­ selves and their literacy schools for others made up a total educ ational system. All that was missing was a strong executive to challenge the tsarist government ; and this came in the late I86os in the person of Serge Nechaev, the first revolutionary nihilist of the modem world. The students' path from positions of privilege and promise into revo­ lution ary opposition began with demonstrations on purely student issues, which spread to provincial university centers like Kazan and Kharkov by the late I85os. In Kiev in the fall of I85g, an idealistic sur­ geon launched the Sunday School movement, using the one nonworking day of the week to provide free tutorials for peasants living in the city. This pioneering effort at popular educ ation acquired a political colorat ion when one of the tutors, P. V. Pavlov, a young Kievan op­ posed to serfdom , became professor of Russian history at St. Peters­ burg University in I86r. He glorified past westernization (the age of Boris Godunov and the quasi-parliamentary zemsky sobors) in his lec­ tures, and participated in the impressive network of 28 Sunday schools in the capital, which involved , some 450 volunteers teaching basic literacy to some 5,ooo indigent students.1 9 Far from pacifying the students, the emancip ation of the serfs in Feb­ ruary I86I only intensified their unrest. A demonstration of 350 St. Petersburg students in March was followed by a second one of 400 in April. A fumbling effort to try one student for embezzlement in the spring led to further organized protests. By the time the long-sought abolition of student uniforms was conceded in the summer of I 86 I, the move was resented as an official plot to remove a common bond of solid arity . 2 0 Student unrest became a student movement with the sudden appear­ ance in St. Petersburg early in September I86I of the revolutionary proclamation \"To the Young Generation,\" written by Nicholas Shelgu­ nov (a veteran of the Crimean War radicalized by subsequent travel abro ad ) and revised by Michael Mikhailov, a young poet who lived in a menage a trois with Shelgunov and his wife. Mikhailov smuggled six hundred copies from Herzen's press in London back to Russia in a false-bottomed trunk, and distributed this call to the \"young genera­ tion\" to reject not only the institutions of old conservative Russia but the reform proposals of the new liberals as well, and to \"move boldly forward to revolution .\" 2 1 The purpose of the proposed revolut ion was the establishment of popular sovereig nty, and the means could be violent: If to achieve our ends, by dividing the land among the people we have to kill a hundred thousand of the gentry, even that will not deter us . . . . 2 2 Mikhailov's arrest early in September and his subsequent trial rep­ resented the first official persecution of a spokesman for radical youth."},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"The Bomb : Russian Violence 393 His personal heroism in insisting on sole responsibility for the pamph­ let helped rally students not just to his case, but to his cause. In con­ trast to some later student movements that would present amnesty for themselves high among their demands, the revolutionary student move­ ment in Russia put personal demands last in order to vindicate their principle s. Fear of the growing student unrest led the university authorities in St. Petersburg at the beginning of the new term on September 22 to shut the unused lecture rooms that the students ordinar ily used for their meeti ngs. This led to a forced entry into the closed Hall of Acts by some five hundred students on the twenty-third, followed the next day by a march of one thousand through the streets to the home of the curator of the university. Such unprecedented acts caused further ar­ rests, and a similar demonstration in October in Moscow-the first of its kind there-led to 340 arrests and 37 detentions. On December 20, the University of St. Petersburg was formally closed. Students mean­ while began to feel exhilarated with the experience of building a kind of count er-university. The sign \"University of St. Petersburg\" was tacked on the Peter and Paul Fortres s, where Mikhailov was being held incom­ municado. Young demonstrators confined in Kronstadt set up their own \"republic\" in prison. University students established their own \"free university\" to continue the process of public enlightenment with the aid of some of the younger professors who resigned from the uni­ versity to protest its forced closing. The free university along with the Sunday School movement were broken up in March 1862 with the sudden nocturnal arrest of Pavlov, the professor who had been central to both. But most of St. Petersburg Uni­ versity did not open until August of 1863. During that final eighteen months when there was in effect neithe r university nor counter­ university, the student movement reached a frenzied climax that did much to set the future course of the Russian revolutionary tradition. First of all, Herzen and Ogarev tried rather clumsily during this pe­ riod to introduce a classical Western style revolutionary organization into the amorphous Russian movement. But their Land and Liberty hardly even touched, let alone controlle d, unrest inside Russia. The arrest of Nicholas Chernyshevsky, in the summer of 1862, his long imprisonment in the Peter and Paul Fortress before trial, and his final exile to Siberia in May 1864 provided the young generation with a hero and martyr. The famous work that he published during this perioc1 of imprisonment, What Is To Be Done? or Tales of the New People, provided a kind of model for the new believers in a rational socialist order. Chernyshevsky's ideal was a student commune ruled by utilitar­ ian puritani sm, seeking to become both a productive cooperative en­ terprise and a center of enlightenment for the masses. His valedictory answer to the ques tion What Is To Be Done? emphasized the need for communal structures and social rather than political goals. The book gave guidance to the student quest for a new way of life and society which �:::: turn produced on Russian soil a new type of professional revolutionary.

In inflammab le, wooden Russia, fear of fire was endemic; and rumors of Bohemian arsonists reached \"down to the last hut, to the homeless peasant.\" 24 And generalized fears were specifi­ cally attached to the new student revolutionaries when the pamphlet Young Russia appeared in May 1862, precisely at the time of the majo r fire. This document was the work of two Moscow students, Peter Zai­ chnevsky and Pericles Argir opulo, and it marked the beginning of a Russian revolutionary tradition demonstrably different from anything in the West. The two students had once had loose links with Herzen's Land and Liberty, and Zaichnevsky had studied the Polish Revolution of 1830- 3 I, admired Mazzini , and made his debut as a revolutionary orator in Februa ry r86I at a Catholic requiem in Moscow for students slain in Warsaw. But Young Russia differed from any manifestoes of the Mazzinian per­ suasion (I) in its almost sacramental exalta tion of the violent act and ( 2) in its identificat ion of violence with social rather than national revolution. There was the uncanny prophe cy : The day will soon come when we will unfurl the great banner of the future, the red banner. And with a mighty cry of \"Long Live the Russian Social and Democratic Republic\" we will move against the Winter Palace to wipe out all who dwell there.25 Violent class war would occur between the imperial party and the \"party of the people\" in Russi a, \"which destiny has ordained shall be the first country to realize the great cause of Socialism .\" If there is resistance we will cry \"To your axes\" and then we will strike the imperial party with­ out sparing our blows just as they do not spare theirs against us. 2G Land and movable wealth were to be redistributed and \"social\" fac­ tories established. A revolutionary elite would have to \"take dictatorship into its own hands and stop at noth ing,\" and only then give power to a national assembly elected by universal suffrage. Otherwise elections could lead to the end of revolution as in France of 1848. Their program of \"putting oneself at the head of every movement \" 2 7 was initially condemned as an elitist Western import by Herzen and Bakunin from Lond on- and even initially by Chernyshevsky from St. Petersburg. In truth, however, Young Russia represented a compre­ hensive revolutionary program authentically rooted in Russian real­ ity.2 8 In the first place, the manifesto grew out of the new, scientist ic"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"The Bomb: Russian Violence 395 nihili sm. Zaichnevsky had come from his small provincial estate in Orel to Moscow University to study mathemati cs. He turned to poli­ tics not out of personal privati on, but out of ideological determination to \"defend the rationality of socialism.\" 2 9 He made use of the litho­ graph proce ss, which reproduced university lectur es, to circulate long passages from two influential sources of the new nihilism : Feuer bach's atheistic Essence of Christianity and Buchner's materialistic Force and Matter. At the time of his arrest the police also found an unfinished manu script translat ion of the original plebeian mani festo : What Is Prop ­ erty? by Proudhon , whose rough-hewn egalitarianism made him per­ haps the most influential single Weste rn revolutionary within Russia at that time .a o At the beginning of 1861 Zaichnevsky had broken off from one dis­ cussion group, the Library of Kazan students, to form a small but in­ tense group of five to seven members which apparently used the name The Society of Communists and became thereby the first \"Communist\" group on Russian soil.3I Zaichnevsky was among the first student agitat ors to cultivate mass support for social revolut ion. His group worked intensively through the Moscow Sunday School movement,3 2 and then turned to more active revolutionary agitat ion in the countrys ide. Zaichnevsky set out on horse­ back from Moscow on May 21, 1861, to spread socialist ideas and develop revolutionary strategy among the peasants of his native Orel.33 A split soon developed with Argir opulo, who argued that \"to preach does not mean to fight.\" 34 Zaichnevsky contended in effect that preaching must-if it was serious-escalate into confrontation and even confl ict. Public confrontation w ith deceptive officials and timid reformers would help strip away the respectab ility of official Russi a, just as the rhythmic student chant of chelovek-cherviak (man is a worm) was breaking up any remaining aura of sanctity about obligatory theology lectur es.35 Preaching socialism, in Zaichnevsky's view, was not merely an educ ational act, but also a dramatic one. Even if the witness should end up sending the agitator to the gallows, the image of the truly dedicated revolutionary would haunt his persecutor just as the Chris­ tian martyrs had haunted the declining Roman nobility. Arrested on the personal order of Tsar Alexander II, Zaichnevsky nonetheless succeeded in completing Young Russia. He stunned Rus­ sian society with its opening lines : Russia is entering the revolutionary stage of its existence. . . . Under this regime a small number of people who own capital control the fate of the rest . . . everythin g is false, everything is stupid, from religion . . . to the family .... a revolution, a bloody and pitile ss revolution ... must change everything down to the very roots . . . we know that rivers of blood will flow and that perhaps even innocent victims will perish ... . 3 6 The same student life of Moscow that had nurtured Zaichnevsky brought abou t within a few years the ful fillment of his prophecy.

Moscow had been the center of much of the react ionary nationalist revival that had accompanied the crush­ ing of the Polish rebellion in 1863. The Moscow Slavic Congress of 1867 became the launching site for a new reactionary pan-Slav ideol­ ogy-w ith the city providing lavish subsidies and its newsp apers en­ thusiastic support. In contrast to the more moderate, transnational Congress of Slavs in Prag ue in 1848, the Moscow Congress became a vehicle for Russian chauvinism. s 7 Once again, the mutu ally re-enforcing nature of the extremes became evident. Moscow, the new center of reaction , was also the new breeding ground for revolution . About ten Moscow student s, mostly from the Volga region, had in the course of 1864 formed a secret revolutionary group called simply The Organizati on; and within it there emerged an even smaller and more secret group known as Hell, which purported to be linked with a European Revolutionary Committee. s s Central to these groups was a certain longing to sacrifice-if not suffer-together. They emulated the ascetic life-style (sleeping on floors and communal shar­ ing) advocated in What Is To Be Done? by Chernyshevsky. Chernyshevsky himself became the ultimate model for the new gen­ eration-both in his reject ion of Herzen and the older radical nobility 39 and in his acceptance of a martyrdom reminiscent of early Christian­ ity.40 The new thirst to translate words into deeds was first expressed in a series of pacts and plots among young Muscovites to free Cherny­ shevsky. The most exotic of the new communes, the Smorgon Academy of 1867-69 (named for a wooden region in the Urals where gypsy bears were train ed), planned to blow up a train to free Chernyshevsky and to smugg le him abroad to found a revolutionary paper. But they settled for sending one of their own members to Geneva in 1867 to reprint What Is To Be Done? This group also idolized the figure of Dmitry Karakozov, the young Moscow student and member of Hell, who was executed for his un­ success ful attempt to assassinate Tsar Alexander on April 4, 1866. However clumsy his attemp t, it did in some ways open a new era of \"prop aganda by deed\" -of terror and count er-terror, which was finally to lead to the killing of the tsar fifteen years later. Hell preached a new and sublimely suicidal theory of assassin ation . Members made vows of celibacy, secrecy, and complete sepa ration from all family and friends from the past. The goal was the assassi­ nation of the tsar- preferably on Easter Sunday. It was hoped that this would begin a broader campa ign by other \"sections\" of a \"European Revolutionary Committee\" to exterminate monarchs everywhere. The assas sin on the eve of his sacred act was deliberately to conceal his true identity not just with a false name, but by assuming a false per­ sonality-ostent atiously adopting a drunken and talkative manner to­ tally at variance with his real revolutionary dedication. Immediately prior to the deed, he was to disfigure his face beyond recognition ; im­ mediately after, he was to take poison-le aving behind only a mani­ festo from \"the organization,\" which would be assured thereby an im-"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"The Bomb: Russian Violence 39 7 pact that peaceful propaganda could never have. The manifesto from the mythical European revolutionary committee that K arakozov left be­ hind so traumatized the government that after his secret trial and public execution, it arrested anyone who even visited his grave. 41 This atmosphere of fearful expectat ion set the stage for the arrival in Moscow of Nechaev, the dark genius of the Russian traditi on. Unlike almost all other revolutionaries of the 186os, Nechaev came from a working- class family. His father had been a textile worker and his mother a seamstress in the bleak city of Iv anovo-Vo znesensk, the cen­ ter of the early Russian textile industry .4 2 When he was nine years old, a year after the death of his mother, Nechaev began working as a messenger in one of the factories of this \"Russian Manchester\" on the upper Volga. For him, the escape to student life in Moscow was a special kind of liberation. He avidly absorbed the mythology of the revolutionary stu­ dent circles of the late I86os, which tended to fuse and confuse into a single heroic tradition the ascetic scientism of Chernyshevsky, the call to violence of Zaichnevsky, and the attempted tsaricide of Kara­ kozov.43 He simultaneously reviled the inadequacies of all past revo­ lutionaries and used his own lower-class backg round as a kind of cer­ t ificate of special merit. He alone had suffered in the past-a nd would call for the deliberate acceptance of suffering and sacrifice in the \"com­ mon cause.\" A Romanian student leader in Moscow, Zemfiry Ralli, had pioneered the professionalization of revolutionary organization by trying to model a secret society directly on Buon arroti's Conspiracy. 44 Ralli then went abroad to become Bakunin's principal editor ; and Ne­ chaev soon followed him to Genev a, gaining accreditation from Bakun­ in's mythical \"World Revolutionary Union.\" While abro ad, Nechaev drew up and published his famed Catechism of a Revolutionary: a bleak guide for the creation of a totally revolutionary personality and for the calculated manipulation of others for the revolutionary cause.45 This was not the first Revolutionary Catechism; 46 and was in many respects a continuation of Bakunin's efforts to adopt Masonic rituals for a revolutionary manual. But the document also represented a final revo­ lutionary answer to Chernyshevsky's ques tion : What is to be done? To the ascetic rationalism of Chernyshevsky, Nechaev added the distilled hatred of the most brilliant survivor of the extreme revolutionary cir­ cles of the I 86os : Peter Tkachev. Tkachev was part of the harassed St. Petersburg wing of all the major Moscow-based extremist groups of the 186os from Young Russia to the Smorgon Academy. He spent much of the decade in prison , which solidified his intense identification with Chernysh evsky.47 He was one of the first Russians to embrace economic materialism 48-a nd may ha ve led Nechaev into taking approving notice of Marx.49 Tkachev mas­ tered the \"aesopian\" art of conveying revolutionary messages through legal journalism ; and in 1868, he published an article that profoundly influenced Nechaev : \"Men of the Future and Heroes of Bourgeois Mediocrity.\" Tkachev suggested that the \"new men\" of Chernyshevsky were ac-"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"THE R rsE OF THE S oc iAL R EvoLUTIONARIEs quiring a focus that would enable them (by implication ) to destroy the hated \"bourgeois mediocrity\" ( meshchanst vo). All that was ultimately needed was that \"all their efforts and aspirations converge towards one point: the advent of the triumph of their idea.\" 5{) They had to be people who gave themselves \"wholly and with total self-deni al\" to this \"idea,\" which was, of course, social revolut ion in Russia. Nechaev provided such single-minded decisive ness. This was the one attribute praised even by his detractors, and it was precisely the one needed to lead quarreling intell ectuals. Nechaev appointed himself, in effect, to be chief execut ive officer of the student movement, which had hitherto performed only legislative and judicial, economic and edu­ ca tional funct ions. Nechaev apparently viewed himself as a rival exec­ utive authority to the tsar. He adopted a series of nicknames suggesting authority : the king, the baron, Liders (from the English leader ), Barsov (from the Russian lord), and Nachalov (from the Russian chief ), the eagle, and Volkov (from the Russian for wolf ). He began using the imperial we, and may have been in touch with an extremist group that planned to blow up the tsar's train near Elizavetgrad in the late summer of 186g.51 Nechaev attempted to instill into the student movement a new model of revolutionary dedication forged in the crucible of the 186os. He in­ voked coarse peasant language�and concentrated his recruiting within the Agricultural Institute in Moscow, where such an idiom had an in­ timidating effect. He seemed to feel a special affinity for Balkan revolu­ tionaries, with their tradition of blood feuds and vengeance. From his early friendship with the Romanian Ralli in Moscow through his visit to the Bulgar ian leader Khristo Botev en route back to Russia in 186g to his admiration for the Serbian assassins of King Michael Obrenovich and his own assumption of a Serbian identity, Nechaev prefigured the close link that was to develop between Balkan and Russian revolution­ aries of the new type.52 For Nechaev \"the revolutionary is a doomed man\" who \"has severed every tie with the civil order, with the educated world ... if he con­ tinues to inhabit it, it is only to destroy it more effectively.\" 53 The catechism told the new type of revolutionary how to utilize different categories of the society he was bent on destroying. The important and intelligent were to be killed; the important and unintelligent were to be left alone, since their stupidity would drive the uncommitted to revolt . A third category, \"animals and high-ranking persona lities, neither intelligent nor competent,\" were to be blackm ailed if their \"dirty secrets\" could be unearthed. Revolutionaries should pretend to follow a fourth categor y of \"ambitious politicians and liberals of various sorts,\" while forcing them on to more radical steps that make it impossible for them to turn back. Fifth were doctrin aire or rhetorical revolutionar ies, who had to be forced to move beyond mere talk and theory into active demonstrati ons. This would serve the dual purpose of killing off the weak and tempering those who survived into hard-core activists in the future. In a final category were women, who would be either the best"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"The Bomb: Russian Violence 399 revolution aries of all or else figures to be treated like the third and fourth categ ories of men.'J4 The Catechism distinguished the coming \"comradeship\" t ovarish­ chestvo from Western organizations with their \"respect for property, traditions ... 'civilization' and 'mora lity' \" and even from the \"brother­ hoods\" of Bakunin .55 Nechaev had returned from Geneva with a mem­ bership card in the \"general committee\" of Bakunin's mythical new \"World Revolution ary Union,\" and he proceeded to found both a jour­ nal and an organizat ion under the name Narodnaia Rasprava (The Peo­ ple's Summary Justice). Its official seal spoke of \"the Russian Section of the World Revolutionary Union,\" and displayed an axe surrounded by the words \"Committee of the People's Summa ry Justice of Februa ry 19, 1870.\" This was the designated date for a revolution ary uprisi ng: the ninth anniversary of the peasa nt em ancipation and the bicentenary of the peasant uprising of Stenka Razin. Nechaev journeyed to Vladimir and Ivanovo in search of peasant recruits for his revolutionary elite, which was organized into a small number of five-man cells. As the connecting link and driving force, Nechaev led the central group on November 21 into the collective murder of a student participant who like Nechaev had worked in a factory in Ivanovo and bore the Everyman name of Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov. The slain Ivanov, an illegitim ate child and for­ mer prison guard , may have drawn the assignment to kill the tsar within the core group of Narodnaia Rasprava, perhaps with explosives being prepared in a books tore on the outskirts of St. Petersburg. He may have then had to be executed because of doubts about his reli­ a bili ty.56 Or his death could have been a calculated crime designed to tighten the loyalty and cohesion of those implic ated in it. In either event, tsaricide appears to have been part of the plan to trigger the social revolution on Febru ary 19, which also included recruitment among the workmen of the Tula munitions factor ies. Nechaev, who fled abroad in mid-December after Ivanov's corpse was discovered, became the object of a massive manhunt in London , Paris, and Switze rland. He was, in effect, tried three times for the murder : fi rst, through the fiction alized version in Dostoevsky's The Possessed, which began to appear serially in Katkov's Russian Herald in 1871; second, in his own formal trial after his arrest in Switzerland on August 14, 1872, and extradition to the Russian governmen t; and finally b y the tsar himself. Upon hearing of Nechaev's defiant calls for revolutionary revenge at his mock execution ceremony , Alexander II changed his sentence from twenty years hard labor to \"forever in prison,\" 57 per­ sonally underlining these words. Yet even in total isolat ion within the Peter and Paul Fortre ss, Ne­ chaev exercised a certa in hypnotic impact on his captors. He eventually taught some of them to write in code ; and, as other political prisoners began to fill up the fortress in the later 187os, Nechaev instructed some of them in \"disinform ation\" : the spreading of false manifestoes to confuse the populace and terrorize officialdom. Once it was discov-"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"4 00 T HE R ISE OF THE S OCIAL R EVOLUT IONARIES ered in the late I87os that Nechaev was still in St. Petersburg rather than Siberi a, plans to free him began to replace the earlier project of freeing Chernyshevsky. After the execution of the tsar on March I, I 88 I, sixty-nine soldiers were arrested on suspicion of collaborating in planning his escape, and the prisoner was put into deeper isolation within the prison. He died mysteriously on November 2I, I882, choos­ ing perhaps the anniversary of the murder of Ivanov for his own suicide .58 Intelligentsia With no acknowledgement of earlier Polish usage, the word intelli­ gentsia was introduced into the Russian language in I86I in an article descr ibing south Russian students in the Hapsburg Empire.59 It soon became the \"verbal talism an\" of the new Russian student generation as a whole-laden with far more universal meaning than it had ever had for the Poles. Moderate liberal s, romantic Slavophi les, and rationalistic Western­ izers no less than revolutionaries all seized on the term. The intelli­ gentsia was alleged by all of them to hold the secret of a national awakening through mental mobilizat ion against the bureaucratic in­ ertia of old Russia. West ernizers built on a long tradition of reverential usage of the French word intelligence by radical pioneers like Chaadaev and Herzen .60 Slavophiles like Ivan Aksakov propagated the image of a Russian intelligentsia as a classless moral force seeking to be closer to the suffering common people than the intellectuals of aristocratic Poland.6 1 Even conservative officials began speaking about \"the develop­ ment of a people's intelligentsia\" 62 ( narodnaia intelligentsiia meaning both a national and a people's intellige ntsia ). Ideological expectations soon outst ripped practical possibiliti es. By the late I86os, the revolutionaries had taken over exclusive claim to the new label, and to the strong sense of collective righteousness that hung about it. Nicholas Shelgunov, the first radical to popula rize the term, had envisaged in his Proclam ation to the Young Generation of I86I a relatively apolit ical, new elite, \"the intelligentsia of the coun­ try,\" 63 emerging from the enlarged student population. Within a de­ cade, Shelgunov had introduced the word intelligent (with a hard g) as the singular of intelligentsia and a badge of belonging. He also made the moral distinction between a true and false intellig ent.64 Pisarev and Mikhailovsky, who became in succession the two most influential radical journalists in Russia after the arrest of Chernyshev­ sky in I862, saw the intelligentsia as \"the moving force of history,\" 6\" and history itself moving in accordance with progre ssive laws set down by Saint-Simon's protege, Auguste Comte .nn Bakunin and Lavrov, the two principal theorists and leaders of the revolutionary emigrant commu­ nity, were moved more by the Hegelian brand of ideology-evident in Lavrov's appeal (in his influential Historical Letters of I868-6g ) for the \"critically thinking personality\" to become \"a conscious, knowing agent"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"The Bomb: Russian Violence 4 01 of progr ess.\" 6 7 Implicit in all the dated quar rels of the late r86os and the early I 87os over \"formulas of progress\" and three-staged theories of history was a shared thirst for ideology as such : for some scienti fic, secular set of beliefs about history and social change that purported to universal validity. 68 In order to susta in the radical traditions of the ea rlier sixties durin g the repressive atmosphere that followed the as­ sassination attempt of r866 one needed the reassurance of history. Thus, the nihilist became the intellige nt. He had moved from icono­ clasm to ideology. In addition to its concern for introducing science into society, the intelligentsia developed a passionate commitment to social justice. The radical intellectual was not generally thought to be fully intelligentny unless he believed in what Mikhailovsky called the \"two-sided truth.\" Mikhailovsky insisted that there was deep meaning in the fact that the Russian word for truth, pravda, meant both object ive, scientific truth (pravda-ist ina) and justice (pravda-sprave dlivost').69 The intelli­ gent had to be committed to both. Though the first body of people to conceive of themselves as an in­ telligentsia viewed themselves as evolution ary friends of science and rejected Nech aevism as a pathological aberration, the convergence that soon developed between the intelligentsia and the revolutionary cause was already foreseen by Peter Tkachev, the human bridge between these two traditions in the late r86os. As \"the only person who defined the intelligentsia in specific terms in the r86os,\" 7 0 Tkachev saw it as an insecure new social group created by the great refor ms, yet left with \"no other means of existence except intellectual labor.\" 7 1 Though eco­ nomically and culturally dependent on the ruling classes, this growing category of intellectual workers was socially and psychologically closer to the proletariat. Rendered almost as insecure as the worker by his vulnerability to the market, the intellectual retained nonetheless the ability to identify his unhappiness with that of all society and to con­ ceive of a full-blown revolutionary alternative. Tkachev believed that most intellectual workers would become supine servants of the state , willing to settle for \"complete freedom in the sphere of his specialty, but nothing more .\" 7 2 But he also saw the possi bility of a saving revo­ lutionary remnant producing what he charact erized in a letter to Engels of 1874 as a \"socialist intelligentskaia revolut ionary party.\" 73 Tkachev sought to find the basis for such a party through close as­ socia tion with Blanqui from the time he went into exile in 1873 until he delivered the eulogy at Blanqui's burial in r88r .74 Tkachev and Ne­ chaev had little practical success, but affected a kind of coup d'imagi­ nation with their ascetic version of Blanqui's idea that an amoral elite must both make the revolution and rule after it. Violence was not just tolerated but exalted by making \"the success of the revolution\" the sole admissible passion. As one of Nechaev's followers put it: \"Absolute honor does not exist; there is only party honor.\" 75 Even before any party had formed , the need had been defined for the kind of sacrificial party spirit that Lenin was later to call partiinosf.7 6 But the new self-"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"4 02 T HE R ISE OF THE S OCIAL R EVOLUTIONARIES conscious intellectuals needed to link their sense of dedication to the social reality of backward peasants and workers. The force for this union-such as it was-was Russian populism. The Banners of the Seventies Populism Populism was never a fixed doctr ine but rather a vague social ideal common to many agrarian societies undergoing rapid but uneven mod­ erniz ation. The two major movements to call themselves populist in the late nineteenth century occurred on the rural periphery of European civilizati on: in Russia and Americ a. Common to both (and to later populist moveme nts) was a thirst for social regeneration that idealized the older agrarian-based human relationships yet ironically prepared the way for the further consolidation of centralized economic and politica l power. Populism became a mode -and not just a mood-of thought when an educated elite defended the ways of a backward region or economic sector confronted by the advance of capitalism and a market economy. It was cultivated by those whose educ ation had alienated them from native roots and values yet who sought symbolic and psychic compen­ sa tion in the idea that \"the people\" would produce \"some sort of inte­ grated society\" 77 that would avoid the depersonalized elitism of cap­ italism. Thus populism tended to revive roma ntic faith either in a threatened culture (the earlier Russia Slavophil es) or region (the later Am eric an populists ). As Russia moved towards mass ive Europeanization, its intellectual elite suddenly discovered the narod, making the Russian peasa nt the repository of all their hopes and personal needs for a more humane social order. Russian populism began with the compulsive ethnographic search within the university subculture of the 186os for an altemate way of life among the Russian peasantry. At exactly the moment when stu­ dents were leaving the universities for revolutionary activity in I 862-63, young artists broke away from the established St. Petersburg conserva­ tories of painting and music to form the new more plebeian groups known as the \"wanderers\" and \"mighty handful\" respectively.

The seminal radical thinker in Kazan, Afanasy Shchapov, turned to social issues through his study of ma terials on the Old Be­ lievers and the Russian North which were transported from the Solo­ vetsk Monas tery in the White Sea to Kazan during the Crimean War. The first populis t-like circle in Moscow (the vertepniki or den of thie ves ) took shape in the last months of the Crimean War under the lead ership of a former Old Believer, who became a leading collector of old Rus­ sian songs as well as a propagandist for democrat ic and atheistic ideas.78 The author of an unprecedented series of books on beggars, taverns, and holy fools in old Russia, Ivan Pryzhov, became an active member in Nechaev's five-man revolutionary cell.79 The isolation of student life and the abstract ion of scientific study thus created among students a deep need for some psychic link with \"the peopl e\"; and by the late sixtie s, the quest moved from ethnography to real life. Bakunin helped the move out to the masses with his re­ newed calls for active links with the insurrectionary impulse purport­ edly latent in the peas antry. But the dominant new trend of the late I86os and the early 187os rejected both Bakunin's romantic vision of gangs (shaiki) in the ma nner of Stenka Razin and Nech aev's network of ascetic revolution ary fives. The new, nonviolent populism began with a second wave of student unrest in I868-6g that led to the closing of the Medical-Surgical Acad­ emy in St. Petersburg in March 186g. A group of some fifteen students, most of whom were medical students like Mark Natanson, came to­ gether in a two-story wooden house in St. Petersburg to form a dedi­ cated and disciplined commune. Nicholas Chaikovsky, from whom the circle took its name, referred to it as an order. The Chaikovsky circle was collectively dedicated to opposing the elitism and violence of Nechaev. Yet the moralism of the group was so intense that it gave birth to a set of rituals that in their own way heightened revolutionary fanaticism. Meetings involved a strange melange of ther­ apy and strategy. A great premium was attached to \"object ive\" analysis of both personal morality and social questi ons . The later, Leninist prac­ tice of obligatory group- and self-criticism may have had its roots in the Chaikovtsy's practice of \"the criticism of each by all.\" They be­ lieved that \"the objective analysis of the cha racteristics and peculia ri­ ties of a given individual at a genera l meeting of everyone\" would provide \"the exact method for the regulat ion of relations between in­ dividuals and society.\" 80 The influence of this circle radiated out to a new student generation through a series of ma nifestoes and a growin g, nationwide web of Circles of Self-Education and Practical Activity. Populism was an essentially Proudhonist-type movement that was antidoct rinaire and ega litarian with a pass ion for older communal in­ stitution s, decentralized federal structure s, and mutual aid societies that dealt directly with pressing social needs and bypassed the political aren a altogether. As with earlier utopian socialist movements in the West, the populist socialism of the Chaikovsky circle was weakened by"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"---- --·- --- T HE R ISE OF THE S oc iAL R EVOLUT IONARIES the flight of Chaikovsky himself to the New World .81 Even more than their Western counterpart s, howeve r, the populist pioneers in Russia derived profound personal satisfaction from their self-appointed roles as \"critically thinking\" agents of the historical proce ss. Seeking a link with \"the people\" the intellectual elite turned first to the urban workers , whose plight had been \"discovered\" through V. V. Bervi's Position of the Working Class in Russia in I86g.8 2 Within the Chaikovsky circle, Prince Peter Kropotkin , newly returned from an eth­ nographic expedition to Siberia, professed to see in the new working class \"the purest revolution ary elemen t.\" 83 He proposed ending the \"privileged labor\" of intelle ctuals and manag ers by closing all institu­ tions of higher learning and opening up \"schools of trade mastery\" for the direct benefit of the worke rs.84 By 1873-74 the workers had become the focus of activity for the Chaikovsky circle and the main hope of Kropotkin for combatting the amoral statists (gosudarstven­ niki) both within and without the revolutionary camp. The anarchist Kropotkin saw a new revolutionar y type, \"the people's agitat or\" ( nar­ odny agitator), emerging from the working class independent of both intelligentsia and \"any leadership from emigre parties.\" 85 He distin­ guished between those who were only tempor arily and insecurely em­ ployed in factories (fabrichnye ) and those with permanent employment (zavodskie). The former, he insisted, were bound to be revolution ary; the latter, refor mist.8 6 But the quest for the masses inevitably led back to the count ryside, where more than four fifths of the Russian population still lived. In the \"mad summer\" of 1874 more than two thousand students left universi­ ties and cities to live among \"the people.\" So intense was the intellec­ tuals' desire to establish identity with the peas antry that Jewish stu­ dents accepted baptism-not out of conversion to Christianity but out of a desire to share this part of the peasant experience. As so often in revolutionar y history nature seemed to be imitating art. Some students went out \"to the people\" singing the chorus of rebellion from the in­ surrection ary final scene of Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, which had its premier early in 1874. Some went to live among the Volga boatmen, as if responding to the dramatization of their plight in Repin's famous painting of 1870-73 , \"Haulers on the Volga\" by learning \"to hate with their hate.\" 87 The repression of the movement to the people and new restrictions on the emigre student colony (particularly the large one in Ziirich) brought back to St. Petersburg and Moscow an angry and disillusioned student population . At the same time, the revolutionaries' belief in their ability to outmaneuv er tsarist authorities was fanned to new heights by the spectacular escape of Prince Peter Kropotkin from prison in the summer of 1875· A precision-drilled team of outside revolution­ aries rescued this famous convert to revolution from the high nobility by a combination of such theat rical devices as signals by balloon and a gypsy violin, and by a message smugg led in a watch by a French­ speaking female visitor.88 Kropotkin and others who followed him abroad immediately began"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"The Bomb: Russian Violence sending back new revolutionary propaganda. Amidst gathering expec­ tation, some four hundred young radicals persuaded a priest in the Kazan Cathedral in St. Petersburg to celebrate a liturgy in honor of Chernyshevsky on December 6, I 876; 89 then met outside for the first open revolut ionary demonstr ation in Russian history. Participants in­ cluded not only the aging veteran Zaichnevsky of Young Russia, but the youthful George Plekhanov, who in the following decade was to found the first Russian Marxist organization . Unfurling a red banner and procl aimin g, \"Long live the Socia list Revolution, long live Land and Liberty,\" the demonstrators gave the loose \"revolutionary populist group of the north\" a new identity as Land and Liberty (Zemlia i Valia). By memorializing Chernyshevsky and revising the name of their original revolutionary organization of the I86os, the Russians dramatized once more their growing sense of tradition. They emulated the established pract ice of heroic courtroom martyrology throughout the long series of political trials beginning with the \"trial of fifty\" demonstrators in Januar y I 877, and reaching a climax in the \"trial of the I93, \" which ended just a year later. The latter, the largest political trial ever held in tsarist Russia, was a tu­ multuous affair extensively covered by the press.9 o Meanwhile, Russia went to war against Turkey; and militarizat ion at home helped move the Russian tradition onto a path previously taken by only a few: terror ism. Terrorism The terrorist turn was inspired by the increased activity of extremist groups in south Russia, particularly in Odessa and Kiev. Odessa was un­ der military administration , and revolutionary leaders there drew on secta rian religious ideas as well as on a quasi-criminal subculture to spawn new forms of extremism. Odessa produced \"the first revolution­ ary organization made up of wage earners,\" the South Russian Union of Workers in I874· 91 Kiev simultaneously generated a series of insur ­ rectionary movements ( buntari) including the largest peasa nt-based rev­ olutionary organization of the mid-I87os, the Fighting Brotherhood. Right-Left confusion was evidenced again by the movement that de­ veloped in Chigirin near Kiev involving nearly one thousand peasants in a fantastic secret society allegedly led by the tsar himself to liberate the peasants from the nobility. The purported new government was to be a Council (Soviet) of Commis sars, and the new militia (druzhiniki ) was to destroy the nobility with pikes and axes.92 At the same time Land and Liberty was moving towards greater vio­ lence. The controlling \"basic circle\" created a group pledged solely to \"disorg anization .\" This included all violent activitie s: the forced freeing of priso ners, the killing of police spies, and the \"system atic destruction of the most harmful or prominent members of the governm ent.\" 9 3 Terrorism began to dominate the Russian revolutionary movement in the fall of I877 largely because of two Ukrainian members of Land and Liberty : the dashing and charismat ic Valerian Osinsky (\"the war-"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"THE RrsE oF THE SociAL REvoLUT IONARIES rior\" ) and the ascetic wealthy patron of the movement, Dmitry Lizogub (\"the saint\" ).94 They suggested that a direct, disciplined political struggle against the autocracy should take priority over everything else in Rus­ sia; and that the sterile debate between propagandists (La vrov ists ) and insurrectionists (Bakuni nists ) should be put aside in favor of a common political campaign. There was an unacknowledged disp arity between violent means and moderate ends. Osinsky argued that \"urban terror­ ists\" should \"terrorize the government\" into providing the same consti­ tutional liberties that he had previously sought as a liberal in Rostov on the Don. 95 Russia was electrified by the first such effo rt : the nearly successful attempt on January 24, 1878, to murder the St. Petersburg Chief of Police, Fedor Trepov, by a former friend of Nechaev, populist propa­ gandist in Kiev, and typesetter for Land and Liberty, Vera Zasulich. A skillful defense and fascinated newspaper coverage tumed her trial into a political investigation of the intended vic tim rather than a crim­ inal trial of the would-be assassin. Despite her obvious guilt , she was acquitted in March, home out of the courtroom on the shoulders of 1,500 to 2,ooo rejoicing students,96 and spirited abroad to become a her­ oine of the revolution ary emigration . Osinsky and his Kievan colleagues echoed Zasulich with several as­ sas sination attempts accompanied by public declarations of the reasons. Beg inning in March 1878, they used a red ova l seal conta ining an axe, knife, and pistol and the label \"executive committee of the Russian soci al-revolutionary party.\" 97 There was as yet no such organiz ation ; but the term \"executive committee\" became central to the People's Will organizat ion that formed the following year. In May 1878 one of Osinsky's proteges killed the police chief of Kiev; in August an affiliated group attempted to ass assinate the tsa r in Nik­ olaev; and in April 1879 a terrorist near the Winter Palace fired five shots at the tsar announcing at his trial, \"We revolutionar y socialists have declared war on the governme nt.\" 98 Osinsky and his comrades were executed shortly thereafter; and the imperial govemment decla red a state of siege, dividing Russia into six military districts. In response, the People's Will organization was formally constituted in the summer of I 879 to fight autocracy \"with the means of William Tell,\" using a highly centralized para-military organization that soon involved be­ tween four and five thousand.99 The structure represented an almost complete retum to the Buon ar­ rotian tradition of secret, hierarchical conspiracy. Each member pledged to the high cause \"every possession. . . . all personal sympathies and antipat hies, all strength and life itself.\" Each member accepted \"absolute subordination to the maj ority\" at every level of the organiza­ tion and the absolute authority of the higher over the lower level. Beyond two lower levels of \"agents\" stood the third, inner group, the famed \"executive committee\" which used the designat ion \"ag ent third degree\" in dealing with all others in the organization . l 00 They sought both to disguise the identity of the controlling group and to insp ire the vague fear that other inner circles might exist even beyond their own."},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"The Bomb : Russian Violence The People's Will genera lly called itself an \"organizat ion\" till early I88o, and thereafter a \"party.\" 1 0 1 From the beginning it rejected the poss ibility of functioning as an open organizat ion , and insisted that members could be brought in only by cooptat ion after a period of ap­ prenticeship as a \"candidate .\" Local \"struggle groups\" were to be under total discipline of the central organization . In the fall of I879, na tion­ wide local organizations began to prolifer ate. A dramatic explosion on November I9 derailed a train that was supposed to contain the tsa r; and on February 5 a massive explosion in the Winter Palace killed eleven and injured fifty-six. \"Political crime,\" wrote a desp airing reac­ tionary journalist, \"has become a veritable national tradit ion.\" 1 0 2 The People's Will came to conceive of itself as a kind of alternative government with its own central \"administr ation\" (five members and three \"candidate\" membe rs ) within the executive committ ee. The or­ ganization derived its authority from two founding \"congresses\" at Lipetsk and Voronezh in the summer of I879; developed local organi­ zations throughout Russia (often existing as separate student, peasant, and worker grou ps ); provided for a kind of legislat ure ( obshchee sobra­ nie); mobilized \"struggle groups\" as a kind of Cossack striking force (even referred to by the Cossack term atamanstvo ); and described its program of carefully targeted terror as the \"ministry of just ice of the revolut ion.\" 1 0 3 They revived the old term \"partisan war\" to describe their campaign against the tsa rist governmen t; 1 04 but the striking new features of their campaign were (I) their massive (and surprisingly suc­ cessful ) efforts to win over large numbers of active sympathizers and passi ve supporters within the ruling class , and ( 2) their almost mysti­ cal dedic ation to their chosen instrument of \"people's just ice\" : the bomb. They gained a protective outer circle of supporters by their selfless dedic ation and asceticism, which attracted liberal and radical intellec­ tuals to write under pseudonyms for their journal. They also won over protectors and \"conce alers\" ( ukrivateli) within the official government establishment, which enabled their nat ionwide network of communi­ cation to function J05 Dedic ation to the bomb was institutionalized in the summer of I879 with the organization of three \"dynamite centers\" in St. Petersburg to assemble bombs for the final strugg le with the autocracy. 10 6 These cen­ ters began to acquire some of the ritual centrality to the life of the new organization that had hitherto been provided by the printing press. While presses remained important to the People's Will, its distinctive new institution was the terrorist cell located near a railroad depot, po­ lice station , or official residenc e. Women were included, giving the cell the external appearance of a peaceful family group . But in some win­ dowless inner room or deep-burrowed tunnel the real business of the \"struggle group\" took place : the assembly and deployment of bombs. Andrei Zheliabov, who became the leader of the final terrorist cam­ paign that led to the ass assin ation of Alexander II on March I, I88I, had been fascinated as a youth by the use of dynamite to kill fish in the Black Sea. He remained in many ways more fascinated with Nobel's"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"T HE R ISE OF THE S ociAL R EVOLUTIONARIES explosive toy than with the tactic of terrorism. Born to a peasant fam­ ily, he had refused to join Osinsky's first wave of southern terrorism in I877-78 because of its aristocratic leadership. Thus, when he en­ tered the lists in I879, his peasant backg round gave a freshly authentic populist quality to terrorism. Nicholas Kibalchich, the ingenious designer of the nitroglycerin as­ sassination packages of the People's Will, believed that he was pro­ visioning a new type of revolutionary movement that would come from within the new industrial cities and bring about the \"complete merging of the political and social revolution .\" 1 0 7 If there was a totalism about his conception, there was also a professionalism about his craftsman­ ship. His bombs were carefully designed to have a destructive radius of only about a meter, requiring closeness to the victim and mini­ mizing any possibility of escape for the assassin. When Alexander II and his assassin both lay fatally wounded by the second bomb thrown at his carriage in St. Petersburg on March I, the third reserve \"thrower\" rushed forward to aid the fallen monarch with his bomb under his arm as if offering a pillow to the dying tsar. 1 0 8 Zheliabov likened the terrorists' spirit to that of the nonviolent early Chris tians. Their moral fervor inspired the novelist Tolstoy and the theologian Solovev to send impassioned appeals for clemency for the assassins. The letter of explanation by the Executive Committee of the People's Will was addressed to the new tsar nine days after the murder of his father and stressed their agonizing reluctance to use violence and their hope for a peaceful transfer of power to the people. Kibalchich confirmed the picture of the noble and reluctant terrorist -going to the gallows unafraid, dedicating even his last hours before execution to the service of humanity by feverishly trying to design a rocket-propelled flying machine. 1 o H The ascetic terrorist sacrificing himself for a new era of freedom and science remained a model for Russia n students even amidst unprecedented repression in the I 88os. Almost alone among Russian revolutiona ries, George Plekhanov at a meeting of emigres in Paris denounced the People's Will for having succeeded only in putting an \"Alexander with three stripes in the place of an Alexander with two.\" 11 o Plekh anov's small splinter group, Black Redistribution, had split off from the People's Will at its founding congress in June I879, insisting on stressing economic over political goals. He opposed the \"firework displays\" of political ass assination just as he had previously rejected the \"childish hopes\" of the Bakuninists for popular insurr ection. 1 u He was to establish the rival Marxist tradi­ tion, slowly and painfully, in the emigration during the 188os and I8gos; but even he recognized that \"to speak up then against the terrorist struggle of the intellige ntsia was completely useless : the in­ telligentsia believed in terror as in God.\" 112 What was the origin of such a belief? Whence came the \"God\" to whom Russia n Marxists themselves would eventu ally pay homage ? Contrary to popular belief, terrorism did not come from the Reign of Terror in the original French Revolution . To be sure, the Committee of Public Safety formally endorsed \"terror as the order of the day,\" and"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"The Bomb: Russian Violence tolerated a Draconian program particularly in end angered border areas such as Alsace under Saint-Just and Eulogius Schneider. But the com­ mittee viewed these as extraordin ary, wartime measures and anathe­ matized terrorisme just as Babeuf lat er denounced furorisme. 113 Marx briefly embraced \"revolutionary terrori sm\" as a slogan and an expedient after the seeming defeat of other revolutionary methods late in I848. He saw it developing in response to \"the cannibalism of the counter -revo lution,\" and revealed the dark secret of its appeal. Terror­ ism was the ultimate method of revolutionary simplification, the anti­ dote to both complexity and confusion, the \"only one me ans\" to shorten, to simplify, to concentrate the murderous death throes of the old society and the bloody birth pangs of the new .. . . 11 4 It was only in Russia of the late I 86os and the I 87os that this vio­ lent, heroic form of simplificat ion became the chosen label and pre­ ferred course of revolutionary action against esta blished authority. The Russians added to the basic ingredients of political terrorism (\"a source of violence, a victim and a target\" 11 5) the concept of terrorism as a \"ministry of just ice of the revolution .\" 11 6 In the most important sin gle treatise on the subject, Nicholas Morozov of the People's Will Executive Committee desc ribed terror ism as \"the most just of all forms of revo­ lution,\" 11 7 since it struck only those who were guilty of crimes against the people. Active terror ism, moreover, provided a kind of baptism in blood for the bloodless intellectual. The children of privilege were ren­ dered fit for the people's \"struggle of equals\" by accepting both the risk of death and the obligation of murder. A commitment to violen ce, in Morozov's view, set the revolutionary off from the talkat ive liberals who were \"purely platonic\" in both \"love of the revolution and hatred of the gover nment.\" 118 The terroristic act provided the \"moment of fever break\" (tochka pereloma) 11 9 for the apprentice revolutionary seeking to overcome the inertia of the wellborn and the inhibitions of the intelle ctual. The Lasting Legac y Blanquism: The Legacy Within The terro rist tradition tha be turbulent age of Alexander II left be­ hind to Russia was both am ·chistic and authorit ari an. It was anarch­ istic in its determination to \"disorganize\" and destroy all existing state power. It was authoritarian in its reliance on a discipli ned, hierarchical organization to accomplish the task. Thus, the People's Will left a deeply divided legacy. Although the story is complex, authoritarian strains generally predominated within Russi a, anarchist ones in the echoes abro ad."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"4 10 T HE R ISE OF THE S OCIAL R EVOLUTIONARIES It is deeply ironic that Blanquist ideas should have dominated the in­ ternal Russian legacy of the People's Will. For Bla nqui himself re­ ma ined almost unknown inside Russia throughout his long life ; and the Russian advocates of Blanquism, Nechaev and Tkachev, died not long after Blanqui himself in the early I88os. But precisely because Blan­ quist ideas became important only during the dramatic, last years of the People's Will, they had the appeal of novelty and the aura of ma r­ tyr dom. The combination created a fatal fascination. During the re­ pressive reign of Alexander III (I88I- 94 ) an appealing glow hung over this dictatorial tradition far more than over the more democrat ic ideals of populism. The clearest sign of continued veneration for the terror­ ists' \"pr opaganda of the deed\" lay in the disparaging name that radicals of all varieties attached to this peri od : the age of sma ll deeds ( malye dela). The longing for great deeds- suicidal assass ination s, dramatic escapes, heroic coups-e xercised disproportionate appeal within the new student generation of the I88os to which both Lenin and his elde r brother belonged. Thus Bla nquism-like Hegelianism and Saint­ Simonianism, the original revolution ary ideologies of the European in­ tellectual elite during the period of sm all deeds that followed the revo­ lutions of I83o-a ppealed to a rising generation of intellectuals only after the death of the master. And once again in a place unforeseen by the man who gave his name to the ism. The Blanquist turn within the People's Will organization can be iden­ tified with the journey abroad late in I 88o of Morozov and of an even more interesting theorist of terrori sm , a we althy Bessa rabian land­ owner and intell ectual, Gerasim Romanenko . The two returned to Rus­ sia in I88I to play an important role in the Executive Committee of the People's Will during its final year of full operation. Whether or not they had been sent abroad as foreign representatives of the People's Will 1 2 0 or merely rose to prominence during the period when the or­ ganization was preoccupied with the assass ination of the tsar, these two men cle arly played a key role in the final turn to Blanquist ideas within the People's Will. Morozov had been in touch with Tkachev and other Blanquists in Pa ris in I88o; and Tkachev had written Morozov on November I, I88o, that \"your program perfectly coincides with mine.\" 1 2 1 Romanenko, who sta yed on in the West a half year longer than Morozov, had links with both Tkachev and his Polish patron Turski. 1 22 In Geneva he published a remarkable call for a \"terroristic revolution\" as the most efficient, just, and bloodless form of social warfare under modern conditio ns. It ap­ pea red under the title Terrorism and Routine,1 2 3 Romanenko argued that only intellectuals could lead a modern revolution. They were \"the most conscious revolution ary group\" that alone could break the fatal hold of \"routine\" and of \"philistinism\" in everyday life. The \"conscious\" elite was, moreover, needed to provide leadership for the \"spontaneous\" and undisciplined masses. The basic Leninist juxtaposit ion of a \"conscious\" vangua rd with the \"spontaneous\" masses along with Lenin's exalted idea of a \"party\" as"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"The Bomb: Russian Violence 4 11 an \"organ of consciousness\" thus have clear origins in the final Blan­ quist teachings of the People's WillJ 2 4 From his return to Russia in the summer of 1881 until his arrest in Moscow on November 8, Romanenko was active on the Executive Com­ mittee of the People's Will. During this period of extreme government repression, the \"part y\" -a s the People's Will now called itself- replied by increasing its Blanquist emphasis on viole nce. A letter of the Execu­ tive Committee to comrades abroad spoke of an \"exclusively milita ry up­ rising with the aim of a seizure.\" 1 2 5 Blanquists perpetually fantasized that the capture of power was within their grasp, and always insisted on power as the prerequisite for social revolution. So it is not entirely surprising that Romanenko in prison should have attempted to persuade the tsa r himself to launch the social revoluti on. He wrote a remarkable letter to Alexander III, using both sides of forty-six pages, seeking to convert him to socialism. It was delivered by the minister of the interior to the tsar at his Gatchina estat e 1 26 just when other messeng ers were telling him that a fresh infusion of youth was reviving the decimated People's Will. On the first anniversary of the assass ination, a \"central university circle\" in St. Petersburg had circulated a hectographed peri odical, Strug­ gle, calling for \"the youthful intelligentsia\" ( intelligentnoe iunoshestvo ) to pick up the revolutionary torch .1 2 ' This group was in touch with both the remnant of the Executive Committee and some peripheral survivors of the People's Wi ll; 1 28 it, too , was crushed not long after the arrest in Febru ary 1883 of the last survivor of the original Executive Committee of the People's Will , Vera Figner . She hurled out a final ges­ ture of Blanquist bravado that became part of the folklore of the new student generation . She insisted that as a sign of good faith to the young the government should release not an ordinary terrori st but the aged Nechaev himsel £ . 1 29 One of the most dynamic of the new radical students, Lev Shternberg, wrote a new defense of terrorism in 1884, after being sent away from St. Petersburg to Odessa. He insisted that terrorism was the least bloody form of revolution in a country so dependent on an intelligentsia for leadership .l30 He attempted to create a new Executive Committee in Ekaterinoslav in September I88s.

Late in 1883, a young poet-philosopher in St. Petersburg University organized a Union of Youth that attempted (I) to est ablish links with the scatt ered workers' sections of the People's Will , with Polish revolution arie s, and with emigre Russians in Paris ; and ( 2) to unify them all through an under­ ground journal, The Revolutionary, and through a new tactic of de­ centralized \"factory-agrarian terror\" designed to rebuild organizational strength at the local leveJ. 1 3 2 After arre sts destroyed the Union in St."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"4 12 T HE R ISE OF THE S OCIAL R EVOLUTIONARIES Petersburg late in I 884, survivors in Kazan attempted to provide fall­ back support and continu ity.l33 It was from this Volga region in the deep interior of Russia that new strength soon appe ared in the form of Alexander Ulyanov, Lenin's older brother. Ulyanov, a brilliant and idealistic young student from Simbirsk, helped form in I886 in St. Petersburg a new Terrorist Fraction of the People's Will, which echoed all the classic feat ures of Russian revolu­ tionary movements led by young intell ectuals-and amplified the new dedication to elite terrori sm. The group first took shape as a central union of regional student groups ( soiuz zemliachestv) at St. Petersburg University. Sasha Ulya­ nov, a young student of the natural sciences, served in all thirteen of the groups that came from the Volga region. 1 34 He was also secretary of a scient ific-literary society and an eager student with a characteris­ tically evangelical dedic ation to the natural sciences, arising early in the morning during the summer months to get the maximum benefit for his experiments of the long days of natural sunlig ht.135 All the understanding this young provincial scientist had of broad so­ cial and political questions was derived from the traditions of the rad­ ical intellig entsia. His entire extracurricular life in St. Petersburg was devoted to the ritual veneration of people or events hallowed in the radical pantheon. The closing in I884 of the revolutionaries' favorite legal journal, The Annals of the Fatherland, rendered young Ulyanov almost incapable of taking his first examinations at the university. He attended the lectures of Vasily Semevsky on the plight of the Russian peas antry as a ritual demonstration of solidarity with a teacher who had been denied a doctorate for being oversympathetic to peasants. Ulya­ nov helped organize the first public demonstration in St. Petersburg since I 876 : a peaceful procession of four hundred students to the graveyard of revolutionaries, the Volkovo cemetery, on Febru ary Ig, I886, the twen ty-fifth anniversary of the emancipation of the serfs . In November, he was thrilled to be part of the student delegation that particip ated in a daylong, one thousand-man demonstration at Volkovo to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the death of Cherny­ shevsky's closest journalistic collaborator, Nicholas Dob roliub ov.l3 6 Thus, young Ulyanov was a pure acolyte of the radical, scientistic in­ telligentsia when he turned to help organize the Terrorist Fraction of the People's Will, the first political group anywhere to call its members \"terrori sts.\" They argued that constitutional rights were indispens able in forming a workers' party in Russia; and that a renewed terrorist threat was the surest way of impelling the government to make con­ cessions. The first ass ault of the People's Will had induced vacillation ; a second effort would induce concession s. A renewed and \"decisi ve terrorist struggle\" was further needed because of the special obligation in Russia to \"wage war on two fronts with capit alism and with the government\" and to \"lift up the militant temper of advanced society.\"137 In one of the debates leading up to the decision of Ulyanov's Terr orist Fraction to attempt an assa ssin ation of Alexander III on the sixth an­ niversary of his fat her's death, a dissenter urged that they pay atten-"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"The Bomb : Russian Violence tion to changing reality : \"St atistics are more frightening than bombs.\" 1 38 But for all his scientism, Ulyanov was committed to bombs. Indeed, Ulyanov explained to the group the functioning of the missile projectile they planned to use . Propagande par le fait meant for him the propagation not of scien tific facts, but of terrorist feats. His statement of the fraction's program was read by the intended victim, Alexander III, while Ulyanov was in prison awaiting execution. The tsa r covered the ma nuscript with apoplectic notations, but consoled himself at the end with Ulyanov's remark that \"under the existing political regime in Russia almost any part of this activity is impossible .\" \"This is comforting,\" the tsa r wrote, 1 39 But the tsar did not find much comf ort ; the omnipresent uniforms guarding him henceforth continued to be challenged-as in primitive societie s-by the power of the ma sk. 140 The mask gave an ordinary man a new identity ; an anonymity that bred fear and uncertai nty ; a public \"image\" that was grotesque, yet awesome and bigger than life . Unlike the uniforms of power that- however oppressi ve-a t least de­ fined clear roles, the new revolutionary mask destroyed all links with the familiar and the predictable, all loyalty and accounta bility to nor­ mal human society. The mask was part of the equipment of the professional revoluti onary in Russia already in the 186os. Hell had preached the need to disfigure one's own face before assassinating an opponent. The Den of Thieves and Bear Academy had cultivated a wild appearance to enhance their shock effect on society. One of the eerie echoes of the People's Will , a terrorist group of 1886 called \"the lancers,\" masked even their bombs by disguising them as diction arie sJ41 When young Ulyanov appeared with his Terrorist Fraction, the men in uniform assumed that the regional student organiz ation to which he had previously belonged, the men of the Kuban and Don, masked a revolu­ tionary group dedicated to peasant rebellion and frontier violenc e. 14 2 After Ulyanov and his fraction were crushed in I 887, a ma sk could not be worn in the great urban centers of St. Petersburg and Moscow, where police controls made terrorist organization almost impossib le. But the mask spread back to the expanses of the Russia n South whence it had first come a decade earlier-from Lizogub and Osinsky in the Ukraine and Zheliabov on the shores of the Black Sea. Beyond the efforts of Romanenko and Shternberg and others to perpetuate in the South the terrorist tradition of the People's Will , there emerged new projects and groups of which the most impressive was the Con­ spirators. Its program echoed Ulyanov's Terrori st Fraction, but was ded­ icated more to organizing urban terrori st cells than to performing ter­ rorist deeds. The orga nization was centered in Kiev with branches in Kharkov and Kazan from 1884 to 1892, when its headqua rters moved to Moscow. Though it never mounted the active campa ign it was ostensibly pre­ paring, its organization served as a training ground in susta ining the conspiratorial sense of solidarity that was becoming institutionalized in the Russian tradition .

His Bolshevik party was deeply rooted in distinctively Russian revolutionary traditi on ; and rep­ resent ed, as we shall see , not so much a \"party of a new type\" as the final formation of the party his brother had dreamed of. Behind the new mask of Marxism was the old figure of a revolution ary intellectual est ablishing political authority through the incantation of scientism and populism and the tactics of terroris m. Anarchism: The Echo Beyond The ideal of a constitutional political revolution had spread at the be­ ginning of the nineteenth cen tury from the center (France ) to the south­ ern and east ern periphery of Europe. In the late nineteenth century­ as if in reven ge-the ideal of a total social revolution beyond politics spread back from the periphery into the center. Masonic officers had borne the revolution ary message out to Russia at the beginning of the century, speaking aristocratic French and calling themselves liberal or repub lican. Impersonal wire services now carried the new message back to the center at the end of the cen tury in the earthy vernacular of mass journalism under hea dlines about TERRORI SM, NIHILI SM-a nd above all, ANA RCHISM. The term anarchism became popular in the West at precisely the time when Russian revolutiona ries were tending to abandon it in favor of terrorism. The most widely read emigre writers about the Russian revolution ary movement (Kropotkin and Kravchin sky ) had left Russia when terrori stic tactics were still identified with the \"disorganization\" of state power and before the People's Will formed as a kind of revolu­ tionary counter -state. They thus identified terrori stic tactics with an­ archistic ideals ; and in the West this identification was to remain dom­ inant. Western press coverage within Russia also tended to accept at face value the heroic anti- authoritarian rhetoric of the revolutionar ies . Thus anarchism tinged with idealism and sanctified by ma rtyrdom became a new verbal talisman for many otherwise dispirited revo­ lutionaries. Many in the West were infected by \"moral contagion from acts which strike the imaginati on.\" 144 Soon after the first shots were fired at Alex­ ander II in May I878, five attemp ts-an unprecedented number-were made to assassinate crowned heads of Europ e. The leading new convert to anarchis t-terrorism in the West, Johann Most, praised the \"Russian method\" and hailed the slaying of Alexander II with an editorial in London. 1 45 Two years later he supported from afar a conspiracy to throw a bomb at the kaiser; and he was arre sted in England for sup­ porting the ass assinations by Irish revolution aries of the British chief secretary and the undersecret ary for Ireland. The mania was spread­ ing, and the horror of an archism expressed in the press made it a label of fascination and even of pride to some intellectuals in hitherto non-"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"The Bomb: Russian Violence revolutionary countries like Holland, England, and the United Stat es. Johann Most took the label with him to America in 1883. The anarchist ideal was propagated in both England and America by an increasing number of exiles from the Romanov Empire : Russians and Ukrainians fleeing political persecution in the I 87os followed by Jewish exiles fleeing religious persecution in the 188os. The term anarchist struck special fear in the hearts of those who were building the new indus trial states of the late nineteenth century, for anarchists identified the centralized state itself as the enemy. For the same reason anarchism provided a banner of new hope to a gen­ eration in France that had become disillusioned with politics : first by a decade of republican repression after the Commune and then by the decision of the rival Bla nquists to support the right-wing challenge to the Third Republic of General Boula nger \"in the hope that it was the prelude to a great revolutionary crisis .\" 14 6 Thus began the fateful ten­ dency of putschist revolutionaries on the Left to see in a right-wing chal­ lenge to liberal republican authority a tactica lly useful stage in pre­ paring for their own social revolution . This thinking proved successful for Lenin, who was to view Kornilov's rising against Kerensky's govern­ ment in September 1917 as a \"gun rest\" for his own revolution ary rifle. The same thinking by German Communists in 1933 was to have disastrous consequence s, when Hitler was seen as a transitory Kornilov tactica lly useful for dest roying the Weimar Republic. The richly reported struggle of Russian revolution aries was increas­ ingly identified in the West with the label anarchist. The activist in­ tellectuals of the 1870s called themselves the \"true,\" the \"new,\" and the \"young\" intelligentsia, 1 47 and brought with them in their westwa rd diaspora the image of pure truth opposing unbridled power. Anarchistic opposition to all power was often imparted in the West by the remark­ able women who played a leading role in the Russian movement-and often enjoyed second careers as wives or leaders of Western radical movements .14 8 But the distinctively anarchist ideal was most ef­ fectively popularized in (and beyo nd ) western Europe by three prom­ inent members of the Russian higher nobility : Michael Bakunin, Prince Peter Kropo tkin , and Count Leo Tolstoy. Bakunin glamorized violent insurrection with the anarchist label, par­ ticularly in Latin Europe, during the late 186os and the early 187os. Kropotkin extended and intensified Bakunin's anarchist vision while ton­ ing down his incendiary excesses after arriving in France in 1876, the year of Bakunin's death. Even more than Bakunin, Kropotkin exerted his gre atest influence in weste rn Europe rather than in his native land.149 The third gre at aristocratic anarch ist, Tolstoy, provided ma ssive au­ thority for the new ideal by renouncing his brilliant literary career in the late 187os and retreating to the barefoot simplicities of his country esta te-rejecting the authority of church, state , and any science or art devoid of moral purpo se. Tolstoy became a pole of magnet ic att raction for the diverse discontents of the late imperial peri od : the \"moral tsar\" of Russia and anarchist counselor to the world until his death in 1910.

Now the latest social revolution ary ideal, anarchism, claimed the allegiance of the world's greatest living novelist for the final thirty-five years of his life. In glorifying an ancient label of abuse, the Russians followed in the footsteps of Proudhon along a trail already blazed in Latin Europe by followers of both Proudhon and Bakunin. Anarchism had previously been rejected by revolutionaries, who viewed the label as a conservative def­ amation if not a provocation. 1 50 Babeuf noted the \"scandalous affection\" of established authority for the threats of anarch ists.l51 Anarchism be­ came a posit ive revolution ary label with a continuous history only in 1840, when Proudhon invoked the term as a badge of pride and a verbal shock weapon. 15 2 Left Hegelianism had given anarchism a new appeal through Bakunin and others in the 184os. Having previously accepted Hegel's exaggerated expectation that politics would trans form the human condition , Hege­ lians now exaggerated the benefits to be accrued from dispensing with politics altogether. This dia lectical leap of a truly Heg elian kind was particularly congenial to Slavs dwelling under autocracy; and the an­ archist ideal as the \"antithesis\" of autocracy proved equ ally appealing in conservative, Ca tholic Spain and Italy. Anarchism became a major force through the brotherhoods and al­ liances that Bakunin organized within and beyond the First Interna­ tional, constituting a kind of Left opposition to authoritarianism and Marxism and convening a host of international meetings in sites ranging from Geneva (I 873 ) to Paris (I 88g ) during the interregnum between the collapse of the First International and the birth of the Second.153 The Spanish and Italian movements were at the forefro nt. The Ita lian Federation of the First International survived the international parent organization and became the largest and most militant an archist or­ ganiz ation of the I87os and the I88os. It attracted more than 3o,ooo members by the mid-seventies to ten regional federati ons, extending thro ughout Ita ly into Sardini a.l54 Though he shared the stag e with Bakunin and Tolstoy in spreading the anarchist ideal, Peter Kropotkin was by far its most influential proponent among weste rn revolutionar ies . Beginning his long stay in western Europe in I876, he filled the void left by the demise of the dist inctively Bakuninist International the following year. He dominated the last three annual anarchist congresses held in the Jura ( 1878, I879, I 88o ). He began to attract a new international following for his teaching that \"insurrectionary deeds . . . the violent expropriation of property and the disorganization of the state\" could progressively destroy the national state and esta blish federated communal organizations through­ out Europe . He left the term populism behind in Russia and rejected Bakunin's term collectivism for anarchi st-communist or simply anar­ chi st.l55 His knowledge of European languages and his experience with both scientific expeditions and revolutionary adventures within Russia enabled him to speak with authority in the West. He channeled his major energies into the international anarchist movement rather than the Russian revolutionary cause. His steady stream of publications at-"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"The Bomb: Russian Violence tracted a growing following, and his arrest in 1882 gave him the man­ tle of ma rtyrdom. The philosophical perspective of Kropotkin's anarchism fell some­ where in between the violent atheism of Ba kunin and the nonviolent religiosity of Tolstoy. 1 5 6 Kropotkin's Swiss journal, Le Revolte, pro­ claimed in 1879 \"permanent revolt by word of mouth, in writing, by the dagger, the rifle, dynamite.\" 1 57 Yet he subsequently also said : \"A structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of explos ives.\" 1 58 His emphasis on mutual aid and small-scale cooperatives suggested a peaceful, Proudhonist return to a manag eable human scale and to distributive justice more than a violent, romantic war against state authority. 1 59 Kropotkin's vision dominated the anarchist movement from the time the anarchist congress convened its forty-five delegates in London on Ba stille Day in 1881. No genuinely international congress of anarchists was to meet again until a week-long gathering of eighty delegates in Amsterdam in the summer of 1907. Throughout the intervening pe­ riod, however, the specter of a Black International haunted Eur ope. Kropotkin's prolific writings lent respect ability to the proposition that \"outside of anarchy there is no such thing as revolution.\" 1 6 0 Agreeing with Tolstoy that \"the only revolution is the one that never stops,\" he saw man's struggle for freedom as the rational, progressive liberation from all rest rictive authority. Anarchists pressed this uncompromising antipolitical faith with far greater success in the 1890s than has gener ally been remembered. They gained some measure of allegiance from more than one hundred thou­ sand Frenchmen, 1 6 1 most of whom followed the peaceful ideal of Kro­ potkin rather than the call of \"Dame Dynami te.\" Anarchists dominated in many ways the early congresses of the Second International until they were expelled at the insistence of the statist German Social Dem­ ocrats at the London Congress in 1896. Anarchists opposed not only the ma nifestly political and increasing ly bureaucratic Social Democ rats ; they also began to cha llenge the more clos ely related syndicalists for daring to create political structures of their own. l6 2 At Amsterdam in 1907, they demonstrated that even the limited sol­ idar ity of a congress could not be sustained. Anarchism fragmented anew, and prior to World War I worked more as a cata lyst within other revolutionary movements than as a unitary force. As a delegate to one of their innumerable and disputatious gatherings put it : \"We are united because we are divided.\" 1 6 3 Yet anarchism did produce a unitary, transnational impact that makes it important for the history of the revolutionary tradition. For it became a sca re word of unprecedented power in the Western world and it kept alive a quasi-religi ous, totalist ic belief in revolution during an era of positivism, skepticism, and evolution ary progressivism. Anarchism as a label became a focus for the suppressed fears of the era; and nowhere more than in Amer ica.

A kind of anarchist revolution did occur in the New World, in the very year when Sacco and Vanzetti were arre sted in Massa chusetts . The location was the most implausible outpost of human habitation, the Pat ­ agonian Peninsula, where Latin America narrows into an arrow point­ ing towards Antarct ica. There, in 1920, Antonio Soto, an emigre Span­ ish classmate at the Military Academy in Toledo of the future Fascist dictator of Spain, Francisco Franco, led oppressed Chilean and Argen­ tine peons in a brief and tragic revolution. Soto had been impelled to flee milit ary service by a reading of Tolstoy and had worked as a sta ge­ hand in an Argentine theater before moving south to lead his short-lived revolution in the name of Proudhon, Bakunin, and Kropotkin.

They produced no political mechanism so impressive as the German Social Democratic party, no revolutionary intellectuals so intense as the Russians. Yet out of increased working-class violence they produced a new tradition that can be described as revolution ary syn­ dicalism : a linking of trade union organization ( syndicats ) with mass action aimed at the creation of a new social order. Revolutionary syndicalism followed Proudhon and Bakunin in rejecting the political arena and all forms of centralized power. In France the movement was strongest, and the line of descent from Proudhon the most dir ect . But revolutionary syndicalists emphasized violence more than Proudhon had- and in a manner different from Bakunin's concept of a primitive military insurrection. They were, of course, forced to work against the tightened police controls and repressive regulations instituted in the wake of the Paris Commune, and they turned to the potential of factory-based organizations for waging a new type of war from below-and from within-the new urbanized, industrial state. It seems ironic that labor violence and revolutionary syndicalism flourished within precisely those societies where private property, par­ liamentary rule, and Victorian propriety seemed most secu rely estab­ lished : republican France, newly independent Italy, and (to a lesser exten t) the low countri es, England, and the United States. The syn­ dicalist tradition was least important within the conservative mon ar­ chies of Austri a, Russia, and Pru ssia.

The violent impulse was expre ssed in the new gunboat imperialism abroad, and in the agitation of anarch ists, sep aratists, suffrag ettes , at home in Europ e; it contributed to \"the strange death of liberal England\" -a nd perhaps of the Western \"liberal\" consensus more generally .1 Restless ennui led much of the European intellectual avant-garde to ac­ quire a certain taste for violence during the long, lingering autumn of relative peace and progress prior to 1914. Edw ardian excess challenged Victorian values at the beginning of the new century; and a large num­ ber of leading intellectuals actu ally welcomed war when it finally came in 1914· 2 Workin g-class violence thus emerged as only a part of the general problem of violence in the industrialized Westem nations. During the 1871-1914 period the modem European state achieved an almost ab­ solute monopoly on the exercise of violence within its own borders . Such a concentrat ion of power was always implicit in the concept of a secula r state that was totally sovereign and territorially defi ned. Liberal industrial states felt a special moral tension between their mo­ nopoly of physical power and their stated pluralism of values and in­ stituti ons. The tension, like the power, was new ; political leaders tended simply to project both the power and the problem out into the world rather than to deal with it at home . There was, thus, a psychological need for the \"new imperi alism,\" whatever its economic and ideological motivations. But imperialism served only to channel-and never to harne ss-t he new forms of violence available to the state . It was a dangerous game, for the imperatives were territori al, not categ oric al. The players soon ran out of space that could be easily taken away from inhabitants and divided among conquerors. The contest returned in 1914 to the disputed no man's lands between the European powers them­ selves-the Ba lkans, the Baltic marches, the Franco-German border. Vio­ lence, which had been latent, became blatant ; and ma chine-gun fire, artillery shrapnel, and poison gas tore apart the fabric of European society during the 1914 -18 war. Well before Oswald Spengler published The Decline of the West in 1919, Europeans had begun to think of themselves as beleaguered Ro­ mans awaiting their fall. In Chitral, Beau Geste, and other such late ninetee nth-century tales Europe had rediscovered the Renaissance theme of lonely men with superior values overwhelmed by barbarians from be­ yond-\"a theme that had been of scarcely any signific ance at all in Western literature from the Renaissance onward .\" a The founder of the Salvat ion Army suggested that \"the heart of darkness\" lay not in Afric a, but \"in darkest England.\" 4 His \"way out\" of the urban blight was to provide direct material charity for the neediest while in­ fusing them with spiritual rather than material militance.

The \"General Strike\" Modern trade unions were not initially -a nd have never been primar­ ily-revolutionary. Nor was violence central to the trade unions that gradu ally developed among skilled workers on a craft basis. These unions concentrated on immediate mat erial issues cap able of at least partial gratification, and rarely embraced an ideological or strategic per­ spective. Demonstrations and strikes seldom had political objectives, and such \"associ ation al\" or \"modern\" violence as occur red was less destructive than the last outbreaks of the earlier \"communal\" or \"reac­ tiona ry\" forms of viole nce . 6 The economic depression of the mid- r87os gave rise to a more mili­ tant type of trade union organization , which developed in Britain and then in France once unions became fully legal in 1876 and r884 re­ spect ively. 7 This \"new unionism\" of unsk illed and semi-skilled workers in large industrial factori es, mines, and transportation gained noto riety as well as self-confidence in the success ful London Dock Strike of r88g. The subsequent rapid growth of large-scale industrial unions through­ out Europe and Amer ica was closely related to the increasing use of strike tactics for revolutionary pur poses. The new militants used strikes both to cha llenge the \"labor aristocracy\" within older unions and to raise the revolution ary consciousness of the masses . The great hope was to build towards a \"general strike\" -a collective act of resistance by a united working class that might lead to the overthrow of both the economic and political dominance of the bour­ geoisie. Like most other major ideas of the modern revolution ary tradi­ tion, the concept has its origins in the time of the original French Revolution . It was Sylvain Ma nkhal who had in 1788 made the first suggest ion of unified proletarian protest against the economic and po­ litical organization of modern society.

Chaumette had argued in June 1791 that violence would not be needed against a tyrant : Just do not support him and he will crumble of his own weight and be destroyed like a great colossus with the pedestal remov ed.9 The idea of a general strike first arose within the working class it­ self in England, where the Indus trial Revolution was most advanced. In 1792 an educated Scottish shoemaker, Thomas Ha rdy, began a London Corresponding society, which soon founded branches in manufac turing centers in the Midlands and in Scotland ; it might be called the \"first independent political working class movement in history.\" 1 0 By 1795, when many of its leaders were impris oned, the society had 8o,ooo members . And in October 1795, it was able to rally 15o,ooo workers to demonstrate against Pitt and his war on revolutionary Fra nce ; sub­ sequently the tradition spread through the United Irishm en, which drew up plans for a mass invasion to liberate Ireland with the aid of French revolution ary for ces. Some of the working class turned directly against the machines of the new factory system during the late years of the Na poleonic wars. The Luddite movement, with its widespread smashing of new textile ma­ chines, spread rapidly from its origins in Nottingham late in 18II. Its repression triggered further, more organized violence from techno­ logically displaced art isans. As early as 1817 there had been talk in Great Britain of a general strike . The term was first popularized in the 183os by an Irish printer in Manchester,ll and made the subject of a remarkable theoretical treatise by a nonco nformist minister who had become the proprietor of a London coffee house. 12 The first at­ tempt at such a strike in an indust rial nation occu rred in 1842 in Britain ; it was led by one who as a boy had seen the \"Peterloo massa­ cre\" of peacefully demonstrating workers in 1819 and had then traded his father's hand loom for a power loom and destitution in a factory. 1 3 A more susta ined general strike occu rred in Barcelona in the summer of 1855. Here as elsewhere the working class was turning from com­ munal to associational viol ence ; and a secret new labor organization, Union de Clases, led the strike , calling for \"association or de ath\" and for a popular mil itia. 1 4 This huelga general provided a model for what was to become a vigorous Spanish tradition of revolution ary syndical­ ism.

The inventive Girardin, then close to Proudhon, had suggested on December 3, 1851, the day after the coup d'etat of Na poleon III, that the only effective answer would be not armed resistance but a \"universal strike .\" 1 6 Under Proudhon's tute lage, the French suggested to the early councils of the First Inter­ national that such a strike might serve reformist and pacifist ends. The Belgians suggested at the Bas el Congress that local workers' coun­ cils and a nat ional Chamber of Labor might \"take the place of the present governme nt.\" 17 A Polish exile linked the strike idea with more mil itant tactics in a pamphlet written for French workers in 186g, La Greve; 1 8 and there were efforts to launch a general strike of workers against the Franco-Prussian W ar. 1 9 This conception was echoed in 1871 by the anti-parliamentary and anti-Marxist Son villier Circular of the Jura Federation , which expr essed opposition to \"political socialism\" and to all forms of state power. It saw the emerging new trade union organization (synd ic at) as far more than \"a transitory phenomenon bound up with the duration of capitalist society.\" It was the missing \"cultural ide al\" for socia lism , and provided . . . the germ of the socialist economy of the future, the elementary school of socialism . . . . 2 0 The general strike helped give corporate identity to the risin g French trade union movement. Even more impo rtant, it sustained among the workers a sense that there still was a uniquely French revolution ary traditi on . It helped check the drift which followed the defeat of the Pa ris Commune towards either the English-style reformism of Paul Brousse and the \"possibilists\" 2 1 or the doct rinaire Marxism of Jules Guesde's \"revolutionary collectivism.\" 22 What gave the militant unions new revolutionary potential was the geographic solida rity they managed to achieve -to begin with, among the textile workers of Ca talonia in the I 87os. Rather than organizing unions according to craft or trade, the northern Spaniards organized all trades and crafts into local area units . These provided territorial power bases that served \"an educ ational role in the present\" as they prepared to assume an \"executive role in a revolution ary society to come.\" 2 3 Similar bases of geographic strength began to appear in Italy ( camere del lavoro) and particul arly in France (bourses du travail), which soon became the center of the syndicalist movement. French unionists were impressed with· the American sympathy st rikes for the anarchists executed after the Ha ymarket riot of 1886. In 1887, the first bourse du travail was formed in Paris. The Bordeaux Congress of French trade unions in 1888 endorsed the tactic of the general strike and equated it with social revolution.

A railroad delegate to the C.G.T.

This pas­ sionate young journalist dominated the revolutiona ry imagination of the French working class from the time he became secretary of the new Federat ion des Bourses du Travail in r895, until he died in his study at age thirty-three in 1901 . Of all the long list of middle-class intellectuals to claim revolution ary leadership in the nineteenth century, Pellout ier probably made the deepest effort to study and understand the actual conditions of the work ing classes 2 6 and came closest to bridging the gap between work­ ers and intellectuals. His Revolution by the General Strike 2 7 of r892 called for direct action to bring these two elements together for the common creation of a new ethos and a new society. The Bourses du Travail provided a new form of worker self-government that had immediate pedag ogic and potential political functions, like the territorially consolidated union organizations in Catalonia. Pelloutier sought to expand it from a mere provider of aid and information into a kind of local, territorially based coun ter-government by and for the workers . Perhaps as few as r .25 percent of the French workers were directly involved in the Bours es; 2 8 but they nevertheless dominated the proleta rian imagination in France by keeping alive the vision of an alternate social order. With Pelloutier's death in 1901 , revolutiona ry syndicalism lost its most dynamic leader; but its ideas gained broader influence as the Federation was absorbed into the C.G.T. The use of strike tactics enormously expanded at the turn of the century throughout industrial Europe. Belgium offered a dramatic ex­ ample-responsive as it was to all three of the great European labor movemen ts : the German drive towards party organization, the British preoccupation with practical refor ms, and the French thirst for direct, heroic action. Focusing on political objectives, the Belgia ns produced three great strikes-each more universal and disciplined than the last -in success ive decades (18 93, 1902, and 1912 -13). Their example in­ spired imitat ion in neighboring Holland ,29 where the Protestant pastor, Domela Nieuwenhui s, repeatedly called on the Second International to accept the ideal of a trans-national general strike as the proleta rian preventive for war. The Second International generally stressed political orga nizat ion on the Social Democrat ic model rather than syndicalist strike s. But the latter inspired special fear, because direct action posed a direct threat to the privile ged classes who felt they \"must find a means of defense or be conquered and crushed .\" ao Sweden, another hitherto tranqui l northern nation, produced a suc­ cessful general strike in 1902, which prepared the way for universal"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"Revol utionary Syndicalism suffrage five years later. If the Swedes subseque ntly followed the En­ glish rather than the French in using trade unionism largely for incre­ mental economic benefits, the month-long Swedish strike in 1909 was nonetheless \"the most complete, non-revolutionary general strike , for distinctly economic pur poses , in the history of the labor movement up to the outbreak of the Great War of 1914. \" 3 1 Revolutionary syndicalism was, however, largely a product of Latin Europe. A week-long general strike of 150,ooo workers in Barcelona in 1902 was followed by an even more ambitious strike in Italy in 1904, the new syndicalists in Spa in and Italy increasingly drawing strength and inspiration from Fra nce. France became the center of revolution ary syndicalism in the early twentieth century, s 2 producing more strikers than either England or Germany,33 an unp aralleled record of successes in major strikes, 3 4 and a series of new techniques for direct action including the serial strike ( la greve tournante, which stopped production by stagg ered pauses without leaving work ), sabotage,a5 and the labeling and boycotting of products. The leading theorist of French syndicalism after the passing of Pel­ loutier was another middle-class journalist and long-time official of the C.G.T., Emile Pouget. In such works as The ABC of revolution and How we shall make the revolution, he set forth a blueprint for para­ lyzing the modern state without using weapons. He argued that the state could not police the far-flung lines of communication and transportation on which it depende d; and that the moral force of a prise de possessi on by the workers would cause the army masses either to join their strik­ ing brethr en-or, if forced to fire by their superio rs, to rebel against their own officers. Pouget followed Proudhon in rejecting all parlia­ menta ry strategies and intellectual dogmas-especia lly socialism which always seeks \"to move towards the revolution along sta tist paths.\" 36 He went beyond Proudhon, however, in arguing for the liberation of women; and in providing an explicit picture of the pos t-revolution ary society, according to which a \"Federal Congress\" was to confirm the spontaneous decentralization of all authority that the revolution ary process would accomplish. Freedom from prejudice was to be assured by a new educ ational system that would exclude all study of the past and include only physical education and the exact scie nces. The new society was to be based not on another Decla ration of the Rights of Man, but on \"absolute respect for the rights of the chi ld.\" .17 Revolutionary syndicalism purported to ignore the political arena al­ together. But news of the successful, nationwide general strike during the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the transfer at about that same time of the main loc ation of the labor wars from northern France to the Paris region suggested to some that Paris might once again prove to be the site of revolution . as Though deeply Proudhonist and nonideologic al, French syndicalism produced a sublime theorist in Georges Sorel. He soug ht to inspire workers with his call to heroism and his myth of a general strike that would transcend the gymnastique revolutionnaire of the C.G.T .39"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"T HE R ISE OF THE S OC IAL R EVOLUT IONARIES Sorel was the son of a bourgeois mona rchist from Normandy and the cousin of a great historian of the French Revolutio n, Albert Sorel. Until the age of forty-five , he was a little-known civil engineer, inspect­ ing roads and bridges and developing a deep contempt for the political life of the Third Republ ic. His first two books appeared in r88g, hailing the heroic poet ry and tribal ethics of the Old Testament as an antidote to the crude utilitarianism of the day and saluting the de ath of Socrates as a proper reward for his corrosive and antisocial rationalism .40 In r8g2, he retired on a government pension to begin a new career as a social critic and uncrowned philosopher-in-chief of syndicalism. Though far more deeply influenced by Proud hon,41 he embraced Ma rx­ ism as a necessa ry cure for the corrosive scepticism of the age and a doctrine that promised to find in the proletariat \"something worthy of survival\" in a corrupt age.42 His hatred of bourgeois society was far more intense than Marx 's, and tinged with aesthetic contempt. Sorel saw only a decadent world of self-serving interest group s, self-indulgent in­ tellectu als, and venal leaders rationalizing their lack of all conviction into pacifistic princip les. The English were scorned for treating wars like athletic contest s ; the French, for succumbing to an arid rational­ ism easily coopted by the Third Republic. He rejected the Enlighten­ ment heritage traditionally honored by French revolutio narie s, and the \"illusions of progress\" that had led the French to worship the state , and workers to engage in demeaning political activity .43 Sorel found an alternative in the proletarian bourse du travail, which was \"a thing of conscience, rather than an instrument of govern­ ment.\" 44 The trade unions which formed around each bourse and im­ mersed workers directly in strike activity provided a heroic alternative to bourgeois politics. The proletariat as a class provided the only hope for regeneration in a society where the upper classes were decadent, the middle classes philisti ne, and the lower classes a perpetual prey for the rhetoric of either ambitious Jacobins or reactionary Ca thol ics. The proletariat to fulfill its mission must build on revolution ary pes­ simism rather than evolution ary optimism : on the heroic, emotional conviction that something must be, rather than the petty, intellectual argument that something will be. Beliefs in harmonious development and social peace were those of a dec aying bourgeoi sie , hoping to drag others down to its level. To avoid such degradation, the prolet ariat must base itself squa rely on a myth : on \"armed pessimism,\" which was capable of inspiring \"heroic acts\" like those of the early Christians and the first Calvinists. Believing the world totally damned, they armed them­ selves with a \"will to deliverance\" that \"changed everything from top to bottom\" before the critical spirit and pallid optimism of the Enlighten­ ment transformed Ca lvinism into \"simply a lax Christianity.\"45 Commitment of a religious kind was a \"necess ary imposture\" in hu­ ma n affairs .4 6 The redeeming myth for the proletariat in a post -religious age was the \"great proletarian general strike .\" This was neither an eco­ nomic strike (simply for ma terial benefits ) nor a political strike (sub­ ordinate to political ambitio ns ). Sorel describes the Proletarian General Strike unapolo getically as a \"myth .\" 47 Myth for Sorel was \"a power"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"Revolutionary Synd icalism that stirs the soul ... a vision of life,\" 4 8 which the proletariat could keep alive only by rejecting every temptation \"to imitate the middle cla ss.\" 49 Class war was the most essential and forgotten concept in Mar x,50 the proper form of heroic combat for mo dern man, and the indispensable source of elan vital for a revolution ary proletar iat. Pre­ cisely because the bourses du travail and syndicats were not political bodi es, they were capa ble of leading the revolution . The workers must, however, unite in believing that a coming Proletarian General Str ike would totally supplant the existing political order. The danger was that this messianic event might be perverted into a \"political general strike\" controlled by politicians seeking to take over (or even to join ) bour­ geois institut ions of govern ment.51 Violence was the indispensable ingredie nt : the chivalric rite de pas­ sage for the proletariat on the path to power, the \"clear and brutal expression of the class war,\" 5 2 which would cla rify issues by polariz­ ing society. Capit alism \"at present stupified by hum anitarianism\" would regain \"the warlike qualities it once possessed,\" 53 and the proletariat would close ranks with the enthusiasm of medieval warrior-c rusaders . Thu s, through Sorel, ideas from the old Left unintentionally became weapons for the new Right. After the bloodshed of World War I, the sublime violence that Sorel had prescribed for the syndicalists would become part of the rationale for Fascism. The leading French politician of the era, Georges Clemenceau pro­ vided a classic illustration of the intern ationalist Left turning into the nationalist Right. He had used his newspaper of I88o, La Justice, to build a reputation as a crusading foe of corruption and a defender of the little man (a technique also used by Hearst in domestic counter­ point to his call for crusades abroad ). Clemence au had also served periodically as the leader of the extreme Left within the Chamber of Deputie s. But it was radical journalism that had remained the favorite medium of the former communard : his new jou rnal of 1897, L'Aurore, had printed Emile Zola's famous expose of the right-wing machinations behind the Dreyfus affair. Yet when Clemenceau himself acceded to power as minister of the interior in 1906, he advocated using milita ry force to suppress domestic disorder. After he became premier later in the year, he dwelt even more systematically on the need for national strength. By the time he launched his new journal of 1913, L'Homme Libre, he had become a militant patriot pure and simple. He called for rearmament against the German thre at, total mobilization once the war began , and a fanatical \"will to vic tory\" that vaulted him into the premiership at the age of seventy-six for the final push to victory. Clemenceau gave his chosen commander for the last battles, Ferdinand Foch , the Na poleonic title Marshal of France, and insisted on imposing humiliating peace terms on the vanquished Germans at Vers ailles. He sent Foch to join another former revolutionarv who had turned to counte r-revolution ary national­ ism, J6zef PHsudsk ( in the last and best-armed effort to crush the Bol­ shevik Revolution in Russia.

There were venerable traditions of viole nce ; and anarch ists , who had issued the first call for a revolution ary \"pr opaganda of the deed\" in 1876 in Ita ly,54 helped more than in most countries to organize the general strike of 1904. It was the largest up to that time ;\"\" more than one million workers particip ated. Since parliamentary procedures and political parties did not evoke deep allegiance in Italy, the syndicalist call for direct action outside the political aren a had a particular ap­ peal. The Ita lian general strike of I9I I against the invasion of Tripoli put into practice the original syndicalist idea of the I 89os : a strike within to oppose war with out. The last congress of the Second Inte r­ national (Ba sel, 1913 ) recorded many pledges of transnational prolet ar­ ian action against any coming war. The Italians provided the most serious practical response by staging in June 1914 the last great general strike before the confl ict.\"u Though confined to one tumultuous week, the Italian strike helped keep I taly-alone of the major European powers­ from entering the war immedia tely after it broke out in July I9I 4· The agitation for Ita lian intervent ion began precisely among the revolutionary syndic alists , who feared that revolution ary France might be crushed and reactionary Austria emboldened to invade Italy. The syndicalist pass ion for heroic myth and direct action fatefully linked the old Left with the new Right. In agitating for Italian intervention , syndicalists helped form \"bands [fasci] for revolutionary action .\" They represented war and revolution as parts of one ennobling process that would free Italy from both monarchical rule and parliamentary proce­ dure. Italian syndicalists echoed Sorel's parallel efforts in France dur­ ing the immediate prewar years to combine nationalist and syndicalist forces in opposition to bourgeois democracy .57 Mussolini was literally baptized into the revolutionary tradition. His father, a radical blacksmith, gave him the name of the Mexican nat ional revolutionary, Benito Juarez. The young Mussolini became a revolution ary socialist, and as a professing Marxist spent some of his youth in refuge in Switzerland. In 1908 at the age of twenty-five , he became editor of a journal of the Socialist party, La Lotta di Classe (The Class Strugg le).

(Forward ), which he with the collaborat ion of the Russian anarchist Angelica Bala­ banov made a militant revolutionary outlet with syndicalist leanings. His journalistic activity as head of an official party organ bore striking resemblance to that of Lenin just a decade earlier. Like Lenin, Mus­ solini assumed personal responsi bility for using his editorial position to determine a general political line. Just as Lenin had attacked \"parlia­ mentary cretinism\" (in Iskra and Vpered, also meaning \"Forward\" ), so Mussol ini ridiculed in Avanti! the parliamentary illusions of less mili­ tant sociali sts. Mussolini also started a smaller theoretical review, Utopia,58 to provide guidance for the creat ion of a \"socialist culture\" -again recalling Lenin's founding of an ideological journal (originally Zaria, later Bol'shevik, now Kommun ist) to complement the daily tac­ tical guidance of a party newspaper (Iskra, later Pravda). Mussolini, of course, diverged sharply from Lenin by embracing a radical interventionalist posture in World War I. He was expelled from the Italian socialist party in October 1914 and founded in the following month his most famous journal, Il Popolo d'Italia, in which he forged his own militant synthesis of syndicalism and nationalism . He argued that war on the allied side would serve both to defeat the reactionary German Empire and to mobilize the masses for direct action against the effete liberal rule of the bourgeoisie . Anyone afraid \"to go out and fight in the trenches will not be found in the streets on the day of the battle.\" The time had come to \"shout loudly\" something \"I would never have pronounced in normal times,\" that \"fearful and fascinating word : War !\" \" 9 His ch aracterization of the war as the \"miracle\" which would end the old order and create conditions for the new foreshadowed the coming totalitarian ism, but also echoed the original romanticism of the revolutionary and Napoleonic eras with its \"politics of the miracul ous.\" The weak liberal democracy that emerged in Italy after the war faced revolutionary challenges from both the syndicalist occup ation of plants and the new revolution ary party that Mussolini created by transform­ ing syndicalist fasci di azione rivoluzionaria into new fasci Italiani di combattimento. The central symbols invoked by Mus solini were almost all taken from the romantic nationalistic tradition of the Risorgimento. Muss olini's Il Popolo d'Italia played on memories of Mazzini's L'Italia del Popolo; Go his rhetoric revived Mazzinian hopes for a \"third Rome\" -not of emperors or popes, but of \"the people\" ; and his hymn of self­ praise, \"Youth\" (Giovinezza), was a reprise on Mazzini's image of Young Italy. Using the classical mise en scene of the national revolutionary tradition, Muss olini and his followers staged in the opera house of La Scala in Milan, the \"first planned violence of post-war Italy,\" 61 a dis­ ruptive nationalist demonstra tion of Janua ry 1919.

The break with his former belief in socialism was dramatized in April 1919, when he helped burn the headqua rters of Avanti!, the socialist newspaper he had once edited. In July, the Fascists offered to help the government suppress a planned general strike. 6 4 During the second half of 1919 and in 1920, Italy produced the most nearly successful syndicalist revolution in European history. Beginning with the metal workers of Turin and spreading rapidly throughout much of the indus trialized north, factory councils were established as a rudimentary form of decentralized worker self-m anagement. This campaign was less violent and political than the maximalist posit ion within the socialist party yet more complet ely opposed to the bourgeois state than the parliamentary wing of the party. When employers re­ fused to deal with the councils, there occurred in September 1920 a spectacular and largely peacef ul \"occupation of the factories\" by 40o,ooo workers with millions more following along throughout Italy. Despite the appearance of red flags and \"red guard\" organizations in many factories, the recent Russian Revolution did not exercise a major impact on the Italian events. The Turin intelle ctuals, Antonio Gramsci and Palmiro Togliatti, who were later to become founders and leaders of the Italian communist party, neither initiated nor controlled the short-lived worker take over of the instruments of production of 1920. 6 \" Their enthusiasm over its raw vitality and their frustration over the missed opportunity for a full annexation of power led them to force a split in the Italian socialist party at Leghorn in Janu ary I 92 I, and to create their own, more disciplined and political communist party of Italy. Out of Gramsci's intellectual visions and pedagogic efforts to provide leadership for the proletariat during the \"failed revolution\" of 1920 came the word and ideal of hegemony. It revived the essentially syndi­ calist ideal of the total cultural reintegration of an autonomous pro­ letariat rather than a mere political dictatorship as the aim of revolu­ tion. The enthusiasm of the young Gramsci over the heroic potential of the proletariat for building \"the future city\" or \"the new order \" 66 recalled Sorel-even if it derived from the rejection by students within Turin University of the dull posit ivism of Italian intellectual life. But the struggle for proletarian hegemony required the leadership of intel­ lectu als; cultural organizations and the means of communication were more important than parliaments and elections in preparing the way. Intellectuals, in Gramsci's view, were at least potentially free from the enervating decadence of bourgeois politics. Italy had so far produced only a \"passive revolution\" -one in which the state had created a polit­ ical dictatorship of bourgeois liberals, without gaining the assent, let alone the involve ment, of civil society. Thus the existing Italian state was held together by force rather than hegemony.

Its first secretary was a former syndicalist organizer , Michele Bianchi. He bore the original Italian version of the name of Auguste Blanqui, whose famous phrase \"who has steel has bread\" had been placed at the beginning of the first issue of Mussolini's Popolo d' Italia. 68 The victory in Italy of the Fascists' national revolution rather than of the Communists' social revolution owes more than a little to the tactics of the losers. Gramsci's first known political article had defended Mussolini's interventionism in World War I, based on the argument that war might destroy the bourgeois state and bring revolution nearer. 69 His crucial decisions in late 1920 and early 1921 brought Mussolini to power-and illustrated once again the frequent interde­ pendence of the extremes of Right and Left. Gramsci, Togliatti, and the others made the fateful decision during the post-wa r crisis to join the extremist advocate of close Moscow ties, Amadeo Bordiga, in splitting the Italian Socialist party and leaving the Left hopelessly divided on the eve of Muss olini's drive for power. Gramsci's subsequent suffering in Fascist prisons, the Italian Commu­ nists' rapid repudiation of Bordiga as a Left deviationist, and Togliatti's deathbed criticisms of high Stalinism (exemplified by the tyrant of Hungary, Matthias Rakosi, who had been a key Soviet agent at the Leg­ horn conference )-all do not obscure the tragedy inherent in the orig­ inal form ation of a separa te Italian Communist party. That party was formed in deliberate response to the externally imposed \"21 conditions\" of the new Leninist Internat ional. Gramsci and the others tragically as­ sumed that by concentrating their fire against a weak liberal democr atic state and reformist socialists, they would hasten their own revolution­ ary conquest of power-ra ther than that of the little understood forces on the Right. The appeal of national over social revolution prevailed once again ; and the chauvinist Right came to power in 1922. The same fateful misperceptions were to plague the German Com­ munists a decade later. They were to see the weak Weimar Republic and the rival Social Democrats on the Left as more serious opponents than the Nazis on the Right. Hitler like Mussolini would be thought to be only a transitory phenomenon who would prepare the way (as Korni­ lov had done in Russia during 19 I 7) for the serious revolution on the Left, which allegedly alone had the mass base to last. The failure to distinguish clearly between rival revolutionary parties was more justifiable in the Italian than in the German case. Mussolini, Bianchi, and others had, after all, been pure political products of the revolutionary traditio n; and they extensively adopted syndicalist tech­ niques in organizing their movement into a controlling national party.

The irony is intense and twofold. Syn­ dicalist ideas were used to help pave the way for the very centralization of political power that the syndicalist tradition had come into being to prevent. More importantly, social revolutionary ideals and expect ations were extensively drawn upon (especia lly in the early period by the so­ called fascismo della prima ora) to legitimize a revival under right­ wing auspices of the rival national revolution ary tradition. The syndicalist tradition also played a role in preparing the way for other Fascist regimes that subseq uently emerged in Spain and Portugal. Thro ughout Latin Europe, syndicalists had legitimized violent direct ac­ tion against liberal democra tic institutions and had frightened conser­ vative Catholics into the arms of a new form of pseudo-revolutionary nationali sm. The final validating illustration was provided by another right-wing dictator who succeeded in overthrowing a fledgling democ­ racy in the 1920s: J6zef Pilsudski. Poland like Italy had been a bastion of the original national revolutionary tradition of the Francoc entric era, and of its expressive romantic violence. These two national tra­ ditions had inspired Europe with much of its revolutionary dynamism prior to the period of Germano-Russian dominance in the last third of the nineteenth century. Like Mussolini, Pilsudski was a left-wing social­ ist journalist brought up in the period of disillusionment and confusion at the turn of the century. Like Musso lini, Pilsudski rode to power largely by adapting his training on the Left to the needs of the Right-and by consciously playing on memories of a once-revolutionary nationalism. Like Mussolini, Pilsudski created what Speng ler would call a pseudo mor­ phosis (a falsified transformati on) of the revolutionary heritage. Pilsudski had been implicated through his brother in St. Petersburg in the same plot to assassinate the tsar in 1887 for which Lenin's older brother was executed. Sentenced to a five-year exile in Siberia for procuring chemicals to aid the plotters, Pilsudski returned to Poland to join the Polish socialist party (formed in Paris in I 8g2) and to found in 1894 an illegal underground journal, Robotnik (The Worker). As with Krupskaia on Lenin's Iskra, Pilsudski's wife was his key collaborator, and they were arrested together in 1900 in their secret editorial offices in Lodz. Pilsudski admired Lenin's milit ance, but saw possibilities for a revolution ary national resurgence of his country amidst the violence of World War I. Proclaimed chief of state with dictatorial powers when Poland at last achieved independence in 1918, Pilsudski immediately plunged into combat with Lenin's rival regime to the east. Like Musso­ lilli's struggle with the pro-Bolsh evik Italian social ists, Pilsudski's con­ flict with Lenin was in many ways an intramural conflict between the national and social revolutionary traditio ns. Pilsudski fought other Poles (such as Lenin's chief of secret policy, Felix Dzerzhinsky, whose parallel career in revolution ary journalism began at about the same time and place as that of Pilsudski ). 70 Pilsudski's program for a feder­ ation of independent national states centered on Poland; in opposing the imperial power of both Russia and Germany it was in many ways a throwback to the romant ic Mazzinian nationalism of Young Poland in the early nineteenth century.n But his slow consolidation of die-"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"Revolutiona ry Syndical ism 433 tatorial power betrayed the democratic substa nce of those earlier visions of national revolution as the path to human liberati on. If syndic alism in Europe thus found itself absorbed into a new kind of radical nationalism of the Right, in the United States in the sam� period it found its purest expression as a doctrine of ecumenical socia l revolution. The Western Frontier Like a prairie fire that burns brightest on the periphery, revolutionary violence became most intense in the outlying regions of Europe in the late nineteenth century. The Balkans, Ireland, and even Australia be­ came major centers of violent unrest. The eastern frontier produced the Russian Revoluti on; but forgotten fires also burned on the western frontier. In the very year that the Russians produced the first succe ssful nationwide general strike ( 1905) the Americans founded the first and only international organization pledged to revolution by means of the general strike : the Indus trial Workers of the World (IWW). As it entered the industrial age full blast in the 187os, America had plunged into \"the bloodiest and most violent labor history of any indus­ trial nation in the world.\" 72 Indust rial violence in America was fo­ cused on gut economic issues rather than ideologica l ones.n The heart of unrest was the great metropolis of the American interior : Chicago. The new city of stone and steel that arose from the ashes of the great fire of 1871 produced in 1875 the first Education and Defense Society, where workers met regularly and drilled with firearms. Six years later, Chicago hosted the first gathering of Americans advocating social revolution by means of armed resistance to authority .74 The first May Day for workers was proposed in Chicago in 1886; and the first broadly based industrial strike was launched there in 1894 : the Pullman strike. Chicago was also the scene of the Haymarket riot of 1886, which created the first modern revolutionary scare in Amer ica, and of the founding of the IWW in 1905. This American version of revolutionary syndicalism was a continent­ wide movement that involved the oldest cities of the East, the newest mines of the West, some factories in the Midwest, and the railway net­ work that connected them all. For the first time since the American Revolution a signific ant number of Americans -most of them working people-ca lled for the overt hrow of their rulers. This revolutionar y movement of the American indus trial era un­ folded in two successive , if overlapping stages.

Then followed the revolution ary syndicalist organization (the IWW ) led by western miners and reminiscent of earlier efforts by the French. Ethnic Unrest The vital new ingredient in America that linked violence with revo­ lutionary ideas was the flood of immigration that began in the mid­ nineteenth century. As the coun try acquired new manpower from Eu­ rope to build railroads, tunnel mines, and fill factories, it also acquired a fresh infusion of ideas. In the early period these ideas came mainly from revolutionary nationalists of Catholic origin, who often became so­ cial revolutionaries in predominantly Protestant Amer ica. Ireland played a particul arly important role, providing 44 percent of the 3·5 million immigran ts who came to Americ a from r840-54.75 The Irish brought with them a rich revolutionary tradition of secret organi­ zation and defiance of authority. Irish immigrants (led by the younger brother of a leading Irish revolutionary of I 848) led the rebellion of gold miners in the Eureka Stockade on the Australian frontier in 1854; •u and the Irish dominated the more sustained unrest among Pennsyl­ vania coal miners in the r86os and the 187os. After the suppression of the Ribbonmen in the late 183os and the famine years of the mid-fo rties, revolutionaries in Ireland became more extreme and resourcef ul. Some new secret societies revived the old agrarian tradition of dressing in women's clothes (the \"Lady Rocks\" and \"Lady Clares\" ); 77 and the Irish countryside began to talk about an altogether new secret society under a legendary Molly Magui re.78 The Molly Maguires acquired an importance in the New World that the y never had in Ireland. They became the defenders and organizers of the Irish immigrants who flooded into the newly opened coal fields of Pennsylvania. Anthracite mining was new to the Irish, who as Cath­ olics were suspect and subjected to frequent unemploym ent, particu­ larly in the recession following the Civil War. They looked for protec­ tion to the Molly Maguire s, who organized largely in taverns as a secret, militant arm of the Ancient Order of Hiber nians. They captured the imagination of America with their work stoppages climaxing in the Long Strike of 1875 against the Reading Railroad. A former radical Chartist, Allan Pinkerton , championed the coun ter­ attack by the railroad owners, infiltrating the Mollies, and using \"fly­ ing squadrons\" to break the strike and arre st its leaders. A sensati onal series of trials led to the hanging of twenty leaders in 1877, including the eight members of the inner, secret center. Legends arose on the Left-and fortified a new literatu re of reassurance on the Right: the de­ tective story. Just as Pinkerton provided a model of detective work in the service of the status quo, so Arthur Conan Doyle, after creating Sherlock Holmes, immortalized Pinkerton's tale of triumph over the Irish miners in The Valley of Fear of 1915.

They took over a ship which they renamed Erin's Hope and sailed from New York to Ireland with weapons in 1864; they chartered a vessel and sailed to Australia in 1876 to rescue Irish prisoners ; 8 1 and they terrified the British five years later by commissioning The Fenian Ram, the first modern subm arine built in Amer ica, for secret missions to Ireland.8 2 As the Fenians went underwater, a rival group went undergrou nd : the Clan-na-Gael or United Brotherhood, whose altern ate name, The Tri­ angle, recalled the mysticism of older occult organiz ations.83 They en­ tertained plans for everything from sinking ships and blowing up the House of Commons to assassinating Queen Victor ia.84 The revolutionary impulse in America of the late nineteenth century became linked with anarchism and assassin ation through the new wave of unskilled immigrant workers, often from southern and eastern Eu­ rope, who were largely excluded from the domin ant union, the American Feder ation of Labor, which was founded in 1886. 8 5 Three presidents were shot to death in the forty-year period after the outbreak of the Civil War. Lincoln was killed a year before and Garfield four months after the first and last assass ination attempts respectively on the life of Tsar Alexander II. But the American assassins were lonely, idiosyncratic fig­ ures-closer to the emotionalism of the Halo-Polish tradition than to the ascetic, ideological tradition of Russia. Indeed, the two most impor­ tant political assassinations to come out of American anarchism at the beginning of the century were committed by Italian and Polish immi­ grants respectively. Gaetano Bresci, a frail immigrant from Florence, had organized a group of anarchists in Paterson, New Jersey, known as L'Era Nuova (T he New Era ). Alone and unknown, he bought a cheap revolver, and practiced using it quietly in a woods near Weehauken while his wife and daug hter picked spring wild flowers. He returned quietly to Italy under the guise of seeing his aged mother; instead, he murdered Umberto, king of Italy, on July 29, Igoo, as he left an athletic festival near Milan. s s A year later, in another place of pleasure (the Temple of Music at the Pan-American exhibition in Buffalo ), President McKinley was shot by a shy immigrant from Poland, Leon Czolgosz. Behind and beyond these isolated acts lay an element of Russian in­ spiration , enriched with a strain of prophetic Judaism from the ghettos of eastern Europe. Czolgosz confessed to having been inspired by hear­ ing a speech by the mother figure of anarchist activism in America, Emma Goldman .87 Bresci's survivors in the New Era group joined in the anarchist agitation (culminating in the antiwar and antidraft move-"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"T HE R ISE OF THE S OC IAL R EVOLUTIONARIES ments during World War 1), led by Goldman and her close friend and fellow Russian, Alexander Berkman. 88 The Russian-Jewish immigration gave American anarchism of the gilded age its most inventive leaders. Their port of entry, New York, began to assume the supportive role for other revolutionary movements that it had previously played only for the Irish: Revolutionary anarchism spread from a movement previously formed in London : the Feder ation of Jewish Anarch ists, which had brought together Yiddish-spe aking artisan-emigrants from Russia in the 188os and 18gos to hear Kropo tkin and other Russia ns. Their leader had been a remarkable German gentile , Rudolph Rocker, who had learned Yiddish only after joining the group, and later becam e the conscience as well as the historian of international anarchism .89 The son of a musical typesetter and a skilled bookbinder, Rocker lived on to see his library and archives burned by the Nazis 9 ° and his hopes of seeing anarchism realized undercut by Communists in Barcelona and then dashed by Franco during the Spanish Civil War.9 1 In his old age, he immigrated to America and saw in its liberta rian tradition the best hope for his fading dreams .9 2 But the dream of an anarchist America never faded for Emma Gold­ ma n.93 She, like Berkman, had transplanted to America Russian revo­ lutionary hopes along with the Judaic idea of a promised land.94 Their rich, lifelong collaboration began in August 188g at a chance meeting in a cafe on the Lower East Side frequented by radicals .95 Three years later, Berkman daringly tried to extend anarchist terror to economic as well as political oppre ssors. On July 23, 1892, he tried to kill the steel tycoon Henry Clay Frick, who had recently ordered reprisals against strikers in Homestead, Pennsylvania. Goldman had imitated Sonia in Crime and Punishment, becoming a streetwalker in order to raise money for a suit of clothes that would make Berkman presentable enough to get into Frick's office.96 She passion ately defended Berkman after his ar­ rest, and continued to advocate forceful resistance to authority in her journal, Mother Earth, from 1go6-I 7. Johann Most , the leading violent anarchist in America, probably wished Goldman had gone elsewhere for her revolution when she lashed at him with a horsewhip at a public meeting for criticizing Berkman. Most (like Rocker ) was a bookbinder whose youthful imagination had been captured by the spontaneous anti-au thoritarianism of the Paris Commune. His bearlike appearance and ins piring oratorical powers re­ minded many of Bakunin . He served briefly as a Social Democrat in the Prussian Reichstag, which he denounced as a \"Theater of Mari onettes.\" He then moved to Austr ia, from whence he was subseq uently banished \"forever .\" 97 In London he was deeply influenced by blow-by-blow ac­ counts of the terrorists' struggle within imperia l Russia.

Born in Utah the son of a pony-express rider, \"Big Bill\" went to work as a boy in law­ less mining towns and was married at an early age to \"Nevada Jane\" Minor .l 1 0 When she was thrown from a horse and permanently incap aci­ tated, Haywood took to drink, to poet ry reading, and to leading a \"war in the Rockies\" against mine owners ; he centered on the gold-rush town of Cripple Creek, Colorado. In the first great strike (in Cripple Creek in I 894), local authorities remained neutral. As a result, victory was won by Haywood's new organization , the Western Feder ation of Miner s, which had been founded by metal workers in Montana the year before . The second Cripple Creek strike lasted for nearly two years and finished in bloody disaster for the union in I904. By then, the overall number of strikes in America had incre ased from I ,ooo-I ,300 in the early I 89os to nearly 4 ,ooo; and Haywood had turned his attention to a broader arena. At the foundin g convent ion of the IWW in a sweltering room in North Chicago in the summer of I905 he presided over 203 delegates. Here at last was a thoroughly indigenous American revolutionary organiza­ tion hailed as the \"Cont inental Congress of the Working Class,\" 111 and endowed with a chara cteristically American nickname , \"the Wobblie s.\" The initial gathering officially represented only 52,ooo workers ; but its perspective was as sweeping as its symbol : a globe (sometimes a sun) bearing the letters IWW. 11 2 The IWW gained a following in the United Kingdom (particularly in Glasgow and among Celtic minoriti es), which grew after Haywood's visit of I9IO-I I to Europe; there were also echoes of the IWW in Mexi co, Chile, and Scandin avia, and a substantial branch in Australia.n s The IWW most resembled the branch of revolution ary syndic alism with which it probably had least contact : the Spanish. The objective of forming \"one big union\" divided into indust rial departments and com­ prising in effect a kind of shadow government resembled the Hispanic ideal of a consolidated sindicato unico. The regional concept of organiz­ ing all workers west of the Mississippi (natural for an organizat ion three fourths of whose founding members were from the Western Feder ation of Mines ) was reminiscent of the recurrent ideal of basing a new syndi­ calist order territorially on Catalonia. 1 1 4 The IWW was, however, most directly influenced by the French. The founding congress of the IWW endorsed the ideal of a \"Social General Strike\" ; and Haywood's The General Strike hailed the Paris Commune as \"the greatest general strike known in modern history.\" 11 5 Ben Wil­ liams, the polemic typesetter for the IWW publicat ion Solidarity, drew on his extensive knowledge of French to translate syndicalist ideas of direct action and particularly organized industrial sabotage. \"We need not 'advocate' it, we need only to explain it . The organized workers will do the actin g.\" 11 6 The IWW organized two particularly dram atic and protracted strike s, involving about 25,000 textile workers each in I9I2 in Lawren ce, Massachusetts, and in 19I3, in Paterson, New Jersey.

The ten-week strike that began in Lawrence in January 1912 was high­ lighted by the evacuation of the hungry children of strike rs, which created nationwide sympathy after their arrival in Grand Central Sta­ tion. Lawrence itself provided a kind of continuing, open-air ethnic fes­ tival. Only 8 percent of the strikers were native-born Americ ans; 11 7 much of the oratory was in Italian and other foreign languages. The ar­ rested strike leader and editor of Il proletario, Arturo Giovannitti, wrote poems in both English and Italian as well as a long and powerful introduction to an English translation of Pouget's Sabotage from his prison cell in Lawrence. ns A confusion of tongues found unity in song. It was \"as if the great American melting pot had suddenly boiled over\" to produce \"a revolu­ tion with a singing voice .\" Even such a sedate commentator as Ray Stannard Baker was impre ssed : It is the first strike I ever saw which sang. I shall not soon forget the curious lift, the strange sudden fire of the mingled nationalities at the strike meetings when they broke into the universal language of song. ll 9 The \"strange sudden fire\" became a holy torch when the general strike moved from the cotton plants of Lawrence to the silk mills of Paterson. Flags as well as songs were central to this great strike in the spring of I9I3. The striking workers in Paterson actually manufactured American flags when they were on the job; and on Flag Day, March 17, they un­ furled a massive stars and stripes of their own under a sign proclaiming : We wove the flag; we dyed the flag; We live under the flag; but we won't scab under the flag. 1 2 o Even more remarkable than the rituals of the strike was its symbolic re­ enactment at a Pageant of the Paterson Strike before a packed Madison Square Garden on June 7, 1913. Financed by the wealthy Mabel Dodge and produced by journalists and artists who congregated in her Fifth Avenue home, the pageant involved more than one thousand of the actual strikers. They were trained as performers and brought through New York in a parade towards the tower of the Garden, which shone with a ten-foot high IWW sign in red lights. Inside, they reenacted the major experiences of the strike in a stunning displa y of living, multi­ media theater. At one point the funeral of a slain Paterson striker was reenacted. As the procession of one thousand workers moved down the aisle with a casket to the widow, some felt the athletic arena trans­ formed into a kind of temple for the consecr ation of revolution.

The man who had largely con­ ceived and written the pageant in New York, John Reed, went on to glorify the Mexican Revolution in his Insurgent Mexico of 1914, and then to write the most influential single account of the Bolshevik Revolu­ tion of 1917: Ten Days That Shook the World. A romantic poet from Oregon, correspondent for the radical Masses, and sometime lover of Mabel Dodge, Reed was an enthusiast in search of a cause. He was a typical American sports enthusiast, whom his friend and classmate Walter Lippmann called \"the most inspired song and cheer leader\" at Harvard ,1 22 Yet, this well-bred radical intellec tual also felt the characteristic pop­ ulist passion to rejoin the common people. A young girl who went to prison in the Paterson strike told Reed that \"we were frightened when we went in, but we were singing when we went out.\" 1 23 Anxious to share in this form of regeneration, Reed went to Paterson, and was briefly imprisoned in a four-by-seven-foot prison cell with eight other pickets. He became emotionally involved with the strike, mobilized his friends for the pageant, and then set off on a journalistic argosy in se arch of a hero. He went first to Pancho Villa in Mexico , then to both the western and easte rn fronts in World War I, and finally to the feet of Lenin and Trotsky as they drove for power in October 1917. Reed's classic account received the imprimatur of both Lenin and his wife Krupskaia. The che-,rleader found a game worthy of his enthusi­ asm. The real-life, \"unrolling pageant of the Russian masses\" 124 replaced pageants in Madison Squa re Garden. Despite a bloody, heroic history of labor wars, the United States did not winnow any enduring revolutionary tradition from the experience of the early twentieth century. The two main reasons for this fateful failure of the Left were nationalist pressure from without and corrosive disunity from within . As had also been evident in the case of Italy, whoever controlled the banner of nationalism tended to determine the nature of the syndi­ calist legacy everywhere after World War I. In the United States, labor unrest was doomed by its opposition to the nationalist fervor that swept through America during and after the war. The socia l revolu­ tionary intensity and the internationalism of the IWW (and the anti­ war , anti-allied sentiments of many Germans and Irish in the labor movem ent) provoked a patriotic backlash. The decade from the Amer­ ican entry into war in 1917 until the execution of Sacco and Van­ zetti in 1927 may be regarded as a period in which a new nation alism rose in America and largely crushed its perennial rival, the social revoluti onari es.

Revolutionary intellectuals dissipated their modest numbers in theoretical debates and in political squabbles within the fragmented socialist parties : Eugene Debs's reformist Socialist Party of America and Daniel De Leon's smaller, Marxist Socialist Labor party. Lenin once called the Cura<;:ao-born, European-educated De Leon \"the greatest of modern socialists-the only one who has added anything to socialist thought since Marx.\" 12 \" But De Leon was as politically inept as he was intellectually brilliant. Even at their peak, the IWW and its militant allies never represented more than a fract ion of the American work ing-class movement. Samuel Gompers's American Feder ation of Labor (AFL) grew from two to four million members between 1914 and 1920; and continued to dominate organized labor in Amer ica. The most serious effort to revolutionize it from within came from William Z. Foster, one of twen ty-three children born to slum-dwelling Irish immigr ants. He was a former IWW mem­ ber who studied in France syndical ist methods of working for revolu­ tionary ends within larger, conserv ative unions. His first effort at \"bor­ ing from within ,\" the Syndicalist League of North Amer ica, never gained more than two thousand members during its brief existence from 1911-14. Foster turned next to a new type of \"amalgama ted\" union, which, like the syndicalist federations in Europe, brought both the craft and indus trial unions of a given industry into one amalga­ mated body for united strike effo rts. He formed such bodies first in the Chicago stockyards, then in the great steel complexes of Chicago and Pittsburgh. In the fall of 1919, a great nationwide steel strike was launched under the group which Foster had orga nized with AFL con­ sent the year before , the National Committee for Organizing Iron and Steel Worke rs. Foster planned to \"catch the workers' imagination and sweep them into the union en masse \" by launching \"a hurricane drive simulta­ neously in all the major steel centers .'' 12 \" He sought something less than Sorel's general strike leading directly to revolut ion, but something more than mere economic gains within the existing system. The strike lingered on into the winter and was supported as far afield as Seattle, Washington, where workers took over the shipyards and launched a city-wide general strike . 12 7 The steel strike was broken slowly but de­ cisively by the applic ation of corporate and police power in the same state of Pennsylvania where the Molly Magu ires had first introduced Americ a to labor violence a half century before . After the abolition of the National Committee in the summer of 1920 and a final wave of labor violence during the depres sion of 1921- 22, the age of militant syndicalism in America came to an end. Foster subsequently became a Communist and an unwavering advo­ cate of the Moscow line. So did his successor as head of the American Communist Party, another Irish veteran of the labor wars, Eugene Den­ nis.

In so doing, he produced the first major break in the basic unity of European civilization since Luther. The Bolshevik Revolution -the first ever made in the name of a doc­ trine of imperson al, materialistic determi nism-was profoundly shaped by the charismat ic leadership of this single man. Returning from long exile in April 1917 in a sealed train through war-ravaged Europe, Lenin led his native Russia in the overthrow of its new provisional democracy. He boldly seized power in St. Petersburg in November; renamed his Bol­ shevik wing of the Social Democrat ic party communist in the following March ; held on to power throughout a long Civil War and against for­ eign intervention ; and formed the Third, or Communist, International in January 1919, in repudiat ion of the democr atic socialism of the Second Internat ional. Once state power was consolidated throughout the world's largest land empi re, the revolutionary tradition faced entirely new oppor tunitie s­ and problems. What had been proclaimed as a social revolution with full respect for national self-determin ation became a form of bureau­ cratic state socialism confined to one country and largely imposed by Great Russia on its old imperial clients.

The German Legacy By Russifying a German doctrine, Lenin was in a sense fusing the two sides of his own heritage. His father was a partly Tatar Russian and his mother a German, and Lenin seemed to combine the familiarity with violence and the ruggedness of a Volga Russian with the organi­ zational discipline of a German. The German part of his inheritance was less import ant, but has been perhaps too much neglected in recent years. German models and assis­ tance were as important to the Russian social revolutionaries of this era as French models and aid had been to the Polish national revolu­ tionaries who dominated the preceding era of eastern European revolu­ tionary history. Lenin's political vehicle to power was a Russian variant of the German Social Democra tic party. His active leadership began with the founding of his journal, Iskra (the Spark), in Germany in 1900 ; and his final move to power began when the Germans allowed him transit from German-speaking Zurich through to St. Petersburg in April 1917 . The German ties with Bolshevism were subtle and opportunistic on both sides, and were by no means those of a simple paid client. But there was a base of common interest not just between Social Democrats in the two count ries but also between the German government and the Russian revolutionary movement. They shared a common oppo sition to tsarist power from the time that the anti-German Franco-Russian alliance was first concluded in 1894; and the oppo sition deepened with the growing dependence of Russian capitalism on France. On the eve of World War I Russia owed France the largest debt be­ tween nations in history. l The new Soviet government became initially dependent on Germany in its hopes first for a supporting revolution from below, then, after the Rappallo agreement in 1922, for economic and military aid from above. The German connect ion dates from the very beginnings of Russian Marxism, which remained until the early twentieth century, a kind of Germanophile minority movement within the Russian revolutionary tradition. 2 The time of testing for Russian Marxists came with pio­ neering efforts in the 189os to lay concrete foundations within the Russian working class for the abstract Western doctrine of proleta rian revolution . Lenin's genius lay in his applic ation of the Russian tradi­ tion of an intellectual vangua rd organization to the new reality of rest­ less agitat ion and rising aspirations among the indus trial working class.

Waves of new workers came from primitive and rural back­ grounds into large new factories and urban complexes creating fresh opportunities for revolutionary mobiliz ation. But the traditional prob­ lem remai ned: a gap between intellectual leaders and ordinary people. The first to bridge the gap was one of the few early Russian Marxists to come from the lower class : Pavel Axelro d. Originally a Jewish Bakun­ inist, he was dazzled in the mid-I 87os during two trips to Ber lin by the combinat ion of discipline and worker participat ion in the German So­ cial Democratic party. He saw in their cultural activities and workers' holidays a \"prototype of life in the future socialist society.\" 3 Axelrod joined Plekhanov's anti-anarchist, anti-terrorist Black Repartition group, when it rebelled against the conspirat orial politics of the People's Will, emigrated to Geneva in r88o, and in 1883 formed the first Russian Marx­ ist organization, the Liberation of Labor. Its first program (1884) did not frontally reject the terrorism of the Russian tradition, but criticized its reliance on political conspiracy. German Social Democratic influence was evident in the call for a broad spectrum of class-based workers' activities and for the Lassa llean idea of government aid to producer cooperat ives. A second program ( 1887) introduced the Marxist concept of a proletarian dictatorship by referring to the \"seizure of political power by the working class\" as the \"in­ evitable precondition\" of radical social change.4 Though Marxist in content, this small emigre movement took the traditional form of a Russian revolutionary circle: a small band of exiled intellectuals seeking unity and hope in a new West ern ideology promising universal liberati on. The only significant group inside Russia to establish links with them in the I 88os was the short-lived (I 883- 86) Party of Russian Social-Democr ats, which was in fact led by a Bul­ garian student at the Technological Institute in St. Petersburg. The first significant Russian-led group was the Social Democra tic Society, organized by a Russian student at the Institute in r88g and posing as its objective the training of \"future Russian Bebe ls.\" 5 The German virus reached Russia largely through the mass-based Social Democratic movements which developed within the western parts of the Russian Empire . By the early r8gos the avenue of conta­ gion led from Germany through Warsaw into western Russia and on to St. Petersburg itself, the histo ric \"window to the West\" of the Eur­ asian Empire. The railroad gauge broadened as the tracks moved east; so also did the vistas for revolution ary activity. Among the first bearers of infection were the energetic Jewish workers confined by law to the pale of settlement in western Russia. Their in­ ternational connect ions and German-like Yiddish language assured easy and early exposure to German ideas. Like the German workers , the Jews had a relatively high level of culture which made their civil and political deprivations particularly galling. The situation worsened dras­ tically for Jews in the r88os, when anti-Semitic pogroms were intro­ duced as a lightning rod for popular discontent in western Russia ancl the Ukraine. With their very identity thus threatened, some Jews turned to their own, intense form of nationalism, Zioni sm, which eventually"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"T HE R ISE oF THE S ociAL R EVOLUTIONARIES helped found the state of Israel. Other Jews found a prophetic alter­ native in the General Union of Jewish Workers in Russia and Poland, better known as the Bund, which was created in 1897, the year of the first Zionist Congress in Basel, and was at the turn of the century the largest and best organized Social Democratic organization in the Rus­ sian Empire . 6 If Zionism was in many respects a uniquely intense variant of the national revolutionary tradition, the new Social Demo­ cratic organizations exemplified the rival tradition of social revoluti on. As if in reaction to the multi-nationalism of the Russian Empire, the first Social Democra tic party within its borde rs, the Social Demo­ cratic party of Poland and Lithuania, created in 1893, proved to be the most profoundly anti-n ationalist of any social revolution ary party. Out of the common national humiliat ion of Poles and Jews , the new party was prodded by the Polish-Jewish Rosa Luxemburg into rejecting all narrow nationalist movements in the name of international prole­ tarian revolution. The Polish party was formed in deliberate opposi­ tion to the new Polish populist party (The Polish Socialist party or PPS), which had accepted a separate national identity for Poland at its founding in 1892. The Social Democrats insisted that the Polish pro­ letariat should fight only for the common social struggle against the tsarist system-never, even as a tactical matter, for any national cause. By the late 188os, Polish no less than Jewish workers were generat­ ing forms of grass-roots proletarian activity 7 that had heretofore been largely unknown to the Russian revolutionary movement with its his­ toric reliance on elite intellectual leadership. One Polish activist of this period, W aclaw Machajski, developed during his Siberian exile in the 18gos an extreme indictment of the parasitic intellectual leadership within the Social Democratic movement. 8 His call for a \"workers' con­ spiracy\" to create a truly classless movement 9 went unanswer ed; but Makhaevshch ina was to become a powerful current of thought on the Russian Left. It built on the established anti-intellectual traditions of Proudhon, Bakunin , and the Russian anarchists and helped revive the populist passions that would lead to the formation of the revolution ary rival to the Social Democra ts, the larger but more amorphous Socialist Revolutionaries or SR's. Intensified anti-in tellectualism resulted from the larger scale of con­ tact that intellectuals were at last having with workers, who were often illiterate and deeply hostile to theoretical ideas of any kind. In the deep interior of Russia this conflict was particul arly severe-as in the case of the founder of the first Marxist groups on the upper Volga, Nicholas Fedoseev. Fedoseev built on the radical organizations that developed in the early 188os as provincial imitations of the intellectual circles of St. Peters­ burg. He led a group of young intellectuals in Vladimir to oppose ter­ rorism and to work for a closer link between peasants and workers ­ thereby overcoming two perceived weaknesses in the People's Will or ­ ganizati on. l o But he had no better answer than anyone else to the problem of the gap between intellectuals and the lower classes-even after his conversion to Marxism.

He was arrested in the summer of 1894 and sent on a long and arduous journey through the Russian North to Verkholensk in distant Siberia. There he sought to retain his sanity by writing a major Marx­ ist treatise on the economic causes for ending serfdom in Russia. But he was denounced as a bourgeois intell ectual, and the isolation and humiliation visited upon him by fellow prisoners left him despondent and isolated. In the summer of 1898 he ventured forth into the taiga and shot himself. I 2 The anti-intelle ctualism that appears to have hounded Fedoseev to his death in Siberia also animated working-c lass agitation at the other end of the Russian Empire in Vilnius. The large Jewish proletariat there took the lead in juxta posing concrete action among workers to the abstract argumentation of intellectu als. One Jewish worker, Arkady Kremer, recommended \"agitat ion\"' as a corrective to the previous em­ phasis on \"prop aganda '' conducted by intellec tuals. He was himself then challenged by an even more anti-intellectual Jewish worker, Abra­ ham Gordon, who accused Kremer of viewing workers as \"cannon fod­ der of the revolution,\"' seeking to manipulate them while retarding their true political educ ation .13 The call for direct proleta rian action was brought from western Rus­ sia to St. Petersburg in 1893 by Yury Martov, a Russified Jewish intel­ lectual who had been exiled to Vilnius after participating in the work­ ers' demonstration at the funeral of Shelgunov in 1891. He returned to St. Petersburg in 1893, armed with Kremer's On Agitation as a guide book for mass action. The drive towards agitat ion was an easte rn echo of the weste rn syndi­ calist passion for direct action . But it was something much deeper as well. The revolutionary tradition was striving for roots in the soil, lib­ eration from its century-long dependence on \"verbal talisma ns.\"' There was a thirst if not for blood, then at least for some kind of blood ritual : a longing to be reborn and not merely republished. Thus Martov went even further than Fedoseev, who had rejected the label Marxist, rejecting as well the terms socialism and social democ­ racy. He sought to break the inherited habits of thought as well as the assumptions of leadership by Russian intellectu als. He wanted work­ ers to unify around an accumulation of specific struggles rather than the refinement of general conce pts, and he was the most important figure in drawing the twenty-odd Marxist groups that sprang up within the capital into the Union of Struggle for the Emancipat ion of the Working Class, which took shape late in November 1895: \"the first Russian Social Democratic organizat ion that made mass agitatio n the pivot of its activity. \" ' 1-! The Union's Vilnius program of accelerated agitation on behalf of the specific needs of workers sought to raise their level of political consciou sness, not just their economic well-being."},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF THE SociAL REVOLUT IONARIES The organiz ation championed strikes and published some seventy ag­ itation al leaflets before its disintegration in I897· Lenin's first organizational affiliation had been as an eighteen-year­ old youth from the fall of I 888 to May I 889 with the pioneering circle in Kaza n led by Fedoseev. But Lenin entered the stage of history as the coleader with Martov of the Union of Struggle and its most effective pamphleteer. Superficially, Lenin was simply another provincial intellectual radi­ calized by early experiences. Shortly after his arrival in St. Petersburg on August 3 I, I 893, he gained acceptance in Marxist discussion groups largely as the younger brother of a martyred revolutionary . Expelled from Kazan University for participating in a student demonstration, he had found a new Western \"bible\" in Samara (Marx's Das Kapital). In St. Petersburg, his Marxist educ ation continued within the circle of a young electrical engineer, R. E. Klasson, who had founded in I89o the first serious Marxist discussion group in St. Petersburg before setting off to study German Social Democracy first hand from I89I-93· Le­ nin's future wife, Nadezhda Krupskaia, had belonged to Klasson's circle, which had sought to bridge the gap between thinker and worker by leaning initially more on Lassalle, who had pioneered mass mobiliza­ tion, than on the more theoretical Marx.1\" Lenin's first long work, What the \"Friends of the People \" are and how they fight the Social Democrats (hectographed in I894), echoed Engels's final view that famine and plague were accelerating the pace of capitalist development in Russi a; and that Russia could progress to revolution only through a period of capitalist development. Lenin vis­ ited Germany in the summer of I895· Arrested early in December I895 for his role in organizing the Union of Struggle, Lenin spent a year in a St. Petersburg prison, followed by three years in a Siberian exile that was far more pleasant than that of his earliest Marxist mentor, Fedo­ seev. Granted solitude, the companionship of his wife, and access to a large library, Lenin wrote his most technical economic work, The Development of Capitalism in Russia, which was published legally in I89g. It was a final assault on the populist illusion that Russia could somehow avoid the capitalist stage of economic development. Then in I900 began his long exile in the West, where he founded the journal Iskra in I900 and the Bolshevik party in I903. Prior to this \"Iskra period\" ( Igoo-3 ), Lenin gave few indications of his future divergence from the still-dominant German model of Social Democracy, especia lly in its theoretical translation by Plekhan ov.1(; If Plekhanov provided philosophical arguments for Marxism out of his ex­ tensive contacts with German Social Democrats abroad,1' Peter Struve joined Lenin on the economic front in attacking populism after he was \"carried away by German Social-Democracy and its successes\" on a trip to Germany. 1 s His Critical Notes on the Problem of Economic De­ velopment of Russia sold out an entire edition of one thousand two hundred within two weeks of its public ation in I894,19 boldly con­ tendin g that Russia's woes came not from the fact that capit alism was developing on Russian soil, but from the weakness of that development."},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"The Path to Power: Lenin 44 9 Though Lenin and Struve met and quarreled briefly late in 1894, such conflicts did not then occupy either of them long. They and all others calling themselves Marxists felt too dependent on each other and on the Germans after the repression that followed the industrial unrest of late 1895 and 1896 inside Russia. Struve went abroad for consulta­ tions with German Social Democrats in Berlin and with Plekhanov's Liberation of Labor group and the Jewish Social Democrats in London. He returned in the autumn of I 896 to become the editor of a formerly populist journal, Novae Slovo; and he provided the imprisoned Lenin with books and printed articles smuggled from Lenin's cell before the latter's exile to Siberi a. 2 o Though decimated by the repression in St. Petersburg, Socia l Democ­ racy left behind Unions of Struggle and Workers' Committees through­ out much of the Russian Empire. The \"fetishization of organization\" 21 acquired from the Germans increased the desire for nationwide con­ solidat ion in Russia. Representatives of the newly formed Jewish So­ cial Democratic Bund met clandes tinely in Minsk with representa­ tives of six other small groups on March 1-3, 1898, for the first and founding congress of the Russian Social Democratic Workers' party. Its manifesto, written by Struve, declared the struggle for the \"total conquest of political liberty\" to be \"the most immediate task of the party.\" � 2 A Central Committee and party organ (Rabochaia G a ze t a of Kiev ) were chosen ; Lenin was designated director of pamphlet publi­ cation; and Plekhanov's group was charged with foreign liaison. The Central Committees of both the Jewish Bund and the Russian party were, however, arrested almost immediately ; and the printing press of the Kiev journal was confi scated. Only with the formation of the rival, neo-populist Socialist Revolutionary party ( 1901 ) and the refounding of a Social Democratic party ( 1902-3 ) was Russia to acquire enduring nationwide revolutionary organizat ions. Until unrest swelled into rev­ olution in 1905, the various Marxist groups of the Russian Empire still tended to look to the German party for leadership. Indeed, German authority in some respects increased as the growing flood of Russia n revolutionary emigration 2 3 turned increasingly to Berlin. To under­ stand the Leninism that took shape on the eve of t he Russian Revolu­ tion of 1905, one must turn from the German seed to the Russian soil in which it grew, and consider both the new type of apparatchik which first emerged in these formative years and the recurrence in Russia of the classic theme of Right-Left interaction.

At the very time in the 1890s when the German Social Democrats were becoming too involved in the existing system to remain a \"party of overthrow,\" the Russians were becoming too estranged from their system to settle for anything less. The remarkable revival of the Russian revolution ary tradition after the 188os grew in part out of the deep interior of Russia itself, where Lenin had spent the first twenty-three years of his life. Like Stenka Razin, leader of the greatest of all Russian peasa nt upheavals, Lenin was born in Simbirsk (now Ulyano vsk) and spent all of his form ative years in the Volga region on the border between Europe and Asia. There the authority of distant, Westward-looking St. Petersburg was never entirely legitimiz ed� and the dangers of frontier violence never en­ tirely absent. Of his many revolutionary pseudonyms, he eventua lly settled on the one derived from the coldest and easternmost of the great Siberian rivers, the Lena. If Lenin drew strength like Antaeus from his Siberian exile in the late 189os, he drew his organizational ideas from the ascetic, self-sacri­ ficial traditions of the Russia n revolutionary tradition. His dedication to this tradition enabled him to remain largely unaffected by Western exile after 1900, and to change the state religion of the Russian Empire from Orthodox Christianity to his kind of Orthodox Marxism within six months of his return in April 1917. One must turn, therefo re, to the peculiarities of a Russian tradition which Marx underestimated to un­ derstand the revolution which deified him. Lenin was baptized into the revolutionary faith by the hanging of his older brother, Alexander, in May I 887, for participating in a plot to assassinate the tsar. 2 5 His path to the revolutionary profession was otherwise altogether typical of established Russian tradition. He was a middle-c lass intellectual, the radical son of a liberal father. After be­ ing expelled from Kazan University for participating in a student demon­ stration, he gained both the time and the motiv ation to study the works of earlier Russian revolution aries, particularly Chernyshevsky. 2 6 He was first exposed to Marxism in Fedoseev's circle through reading the authori tative Das Kapital rather than the exhorta tive Communist Man­ ifesto. During the four years he spent in Samara on the upper Volga from October 1889 to August 1893, Lenin had considerable contact with a powerful survivor of the Russian Blanquist tradition, who later wrote that \"the idea of the dictatorship of the prole tariat had already occurred to him.\" 2 7 After moving to St. Petersburg to study law in 1893, Lenin plunged into the ideological struggle against the populist belief that mass sup­ port for any revolution must come from the peasa ntry. Mikhail ovsky, whom Lenin had met in Samara in 1892, became a special polemic target in Lenin's What the \"Friends of the People \" are and how they fight the Social Democrats in r8g4."},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"The Path to Power: Lenin 4 5 1 This work already revealed two enduring and interrelated charact er­ istics of Lenin as a revolut ionary : his focus on power and his contempt for the intellige ntsia. Lenin sought not so much to refute the populists' misunderstanding of Marxism or their errors of analysis (the main com­ plaints of simultaneous antipopulist tracts by Plekhanov and Struve respe ctively ), but rather to wrest away from the populists the appeal­ ing title of \"friend of the people.\" Mikhailovsky stood in a kind of apostolic success ion to Herzen and Chernyshevsky as the journ alistic spokesman of the revolution ary in­ telligentsia, and Lenin sought in effect to subst itute himself for Mi­ khailovsky as heir to that sacred traditi on. One of his most important and origin al slogans was first formulated in another work of the same year, this time addressed not to his populist foes but to an insuffi­ ciently militant Marxist ally. Rebuking Struve for using \"the language of an object ivist and not a Marxist (materiali st),\" Lenin insist ed: \"Ma­ terialism contains within it, so to speak, a party spirit ( partiinost ' )\" that requires addressing all social questions from the perspective of class warfare and reject ing the narrow \"spirit of the circles\" (kruzhkovsh­ china) in which intellectuals simply talk to each other. 28 Lenin threw himself into the polemic campaigns of the Union of Struggle, which had at least succeeded in linking the intellectual elite with genuine workin g-class organiz ation s. More than 70 percent of the more than one hundred fifty identified members of the union were workers ,29 yet the organizational structure of the union followed the established consp iratorial traditions of Russian revolutionaries rather than anything even faintly resembling German Social Democra cy.3 o A \"directing center\" of five intellectuals headed by Lenin stood at the center of the organizing group of seventeen. Three regional groups in St. Petersburg were each headed by one of the five directo rs.3 1 The two key directors (Lenin and Martov) were exempted from local affiliations to provide strategic direction and ensure maximum security. There were no workers in the central direct orate ; and proletarian participa­ tion was apparently confined to the special category of \"worker­ organizers\" who provided the link between the Social Democr atic cir­ cles of different plants within each of the three districts. Martov (leader of the fraction called \"the young\" ) appears to have done more than the \"elder\" Lenin to lead the St. Petersburg union away from the traditional tutorial relationship to the lower classes. His con­ cept of agitation combined the syndicalist idea of direct action on im­ mediate issues with the Marxist conviction that each individual action should deepen proletarian confidence that \"the struggle will not stop until the complete emancipat ion of the workers from the oppression of capital is achieve d.\" 32 Lenin participated in the union for only a few weeks before he was arrested, but he continued to communicate with the organization fairly freely during his year in prison prior to exile. The question of the extent of Lenin's influence on the group has unnecess arily preoccupied histori ans, who have not yet perhaps devoted enough attention to the"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"45 2 THE RrsE OF THE SoCIAL REVOLU TIONAR IES possible influence of the group on Lenin. For Lenin's associates during this period remained close to him throughout the decade from his first arrival in St. Petersburg until the formal birth of the Bolshevik party in I903. Most of them played important roles during Lenin's short-lived rule over the new Soviet state. Whatever the exact nature of Lenin's leadership over them, he also clearly needed them to build a political organizat ion. Thus, Lenin's key associates of this formative decade can be described as the first Leninist apparat: the \"men of the apparatus\" (apparatch iki) who preceded- and in many ways created-the Leninist \"party of a new type.\" Lenin's key associates were almost all middle-class intellectuals drawn to revolutionary activity not so much out of deep conviction as out of the inertial habit of the St. Petersburg student subculture. Un­ like the earlier student radicals who were con sumed by ideas, these young Marxists were basica lly technicians in pursuit of careers. They were trained in engineering tasks for jobs in the rapidly growin g in­ dustrial sector of the Russian Empire ; they sought to apply the pro­ fessional standards acquired in their technical training to revolutionary activity as well. They came together in a single place in St. Petersburg that may have been as important in incubating revolution there as the Palais-Royal had once been in Paris. Just as the royal house of Orleans had unintention ally provided sanctuary for proto-revolutionary intellec­ tuals in the late I78os, so the imperially favored Technological Insti­ tute offered a century later a sheltered hothouse in cold St. Petersburg for new revolutionary growth . The Technological Institute The St. Petersburg Practical Technological Institute of Emperor Nich­ olas I had produced its share of revolutionary heroes in the I87os and experienced its share of restrictions in the I 88os, including the reintro­ duction of the hated student uniform. What enabled the institute to pro­ vide the strategic command post for the next stage of revolutionary un­ rest was the creation in one corner of its massive pentagonal courtyard of a separate three-story building, which was completely controlled by stu­ dents and eventually became in effect a liberated zone for revolution aries. Originally built in I87g-8o as an apolitical student dining facility, the building became the center for a growing range of studen t-run activitie s, particula rly after the formation in I 884 of the \"society of technolo gists,\" which initially focused on the problem of finding jobs. This inner building became both a gathering p lace and a citadel for the new generation of students who were helping Russia enter the industrial era. The institute was the largest technical school in Rus­ sia, bringing more than five hundred students together in one concen­ trated location (unlike the dispersed buildings of the university ), and subject ing them to a harsh common regimen of laboratories and work­ shops that \"reminded one considerably more of a factory or plant than of anything taking place in a university. \" sa"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"The Path to Power: Lenin 453 Some of the pioneering Jewish Social Democrats arrived at the insti­ tute from Vilnius in 188s, and further contacts with revolutionary centers were facilitated by the founding of an affiliated institute at Kharkov the following year. A Polish student apparently first intro­ duced Marxist ideas to the institute; the student dining facility pro­ vided a secure meeting place; and the well-stocked library in the same student-run building soon included at least four copies of Das Kapital, which was otherwise almost unobtaina ble in St. Petersburg. By the early I 8gos, each higher educ ational institution in the capital had acquired (in the words of Lenin's future wife, Nadezhda Krupskai a) \"its own physiogno my.\" The Forestry Institute was a center of populism, the University of \"legal Marxism,\" and the Technological Institute of revolutionary Social Democracy.:14 The first group to combine the study of Marxism with the organiza tion of workers was led by a railroad engineer at the institute, Mikhail Brusnev. The key figure in this circle was a young Siberian student at the institute, Leonid Krasin. His account of these years sounds at first like a repetition of earlier circles of the Russian revolutionary intelli­ gentsi a. The students discovered the progressive use of scientific dis­ coveries for revolutionary ends (from the Greek fire to Kibalchich's bomb ); identified with the traditions of the intelligentsia ( demonstrat­ ing at the funeral of Nicholas Shelgunov in 1891); and appointed them­ selves leaders over the workers , among whom alle gedly, \"the intellec­ tual is needed for systematic activity and propaga nda.\" 3 5 Yet that link with the w orking class represents one of those powerful turning points in human history. Brusnev's new circle of 1891 sud­ denly plunged the intellectual avant-garde into the real world of the Russian working classes. Brusnev himself was the nonintellectual son of a Don Cossack with broad connections in the working class. He and Osip Tsivin sky, another Pole with practical experience among the pro­ letariat, worked with Krasin, who became the leader of a new group of Social Democratic textile workers. The great divide between intellectuals and workers was bridged in rituals that had some of the qualities of baptism into a new life. Krasin had to don older clothes, take a new name (\"Nikitich\" ), and move across the city from the world in which electricity had been introduced to a world still largely in darkne ss. He learned workers' slang and incor­ porated some of it into a proclamation for a strike in the St. Petersburg port district in 18go; but his language was denounced as too bashkovity ( egghead ed) by workers who resented following a leader too young to grow a full moustache .an Brusnev's followers used familial forms and designations like \"father\" for the leading worker-organizer and \"uncle\" for Brusnev's leading col­ laborat or.37 And there were more than a few wives. Krupskaia was only one of four female teachers who participated in the new evening \"Sun­ day School\" for workers organized by the Brusnev circle and ended up marrying one of the male revolution aries.'1 8 But the o n l y way of ultimately bridging the gap between intellectuals"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"454 T HE R ISE OF THE S OCIAL R EVOLUTIONARIES and workers was by forcing both to become something neither of them had been before : full-ti me, professional organizers . Thus, in r8go was born in effect the first systematic cadre training program of the mod­ ern revolutionary tradition : the so-called Circle of Organizers ( kruzhok organizatorov ). The tradition of the People's Will was modified by the technical and manag erial training of the Technological Institute itself in a move towards the professional ization that was essential to combat more sophisticated police methods. The Circle of Organizers met secretly during the worship hours on Sunday and on workday evenings ; and the inner party apparatus of the future can be viewed as its direct lineal descendant. The circle es­ senti ally organized the Shelgunov demonstrat ion in March and the first May Day demonstration in r8gi; Krasin organized on its behalf in the same year the first Social Democratic women's organization in Russia.39 There were concerted efforts to recruit seminarians in the Theological Academy of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra and to start a parallel or­ ganizing effort in the Taganka section of Moscow; but police repression decimated the organization, expelling one hundred students including Krasin from St. Petersburg after the Shelgunov demonstration, and ar­ resting Brusnev himself the following year. Their dep arture served only to scatter new ideas of Social Democratic organiza tion into the various regions of Russia where the expelled and arrested organizers were sent. Krasin had a chance to play the role of spreading the gospel of Social Democratic revolutionary organiz ation in Nizhni-Novogord , Irkutsk, the Crimea, Kharkov, and finally in Baku, where he was given a key engineering job in an electrical compa ny by the exiled originator of the Social Democratic agitation in the Technological Institute, R. E. Klasson .4 0 Klasson and Krasin were part of a kind of electricians' mafia, which enjoyed a certa in immunity from prosec ution because of the desperate need in a rapidly indus trializing economy for native technology. Gleb Krzhizhanovsky of Samara, another product of the St. Petersburg Tech­ nological Institute, became a legend in the revolutionary underground for his skillful use of electrical technology for revolutionary purpose s, and was repeatedly aided in exile by classmates from the institute .1 1 The most famous alumna of Klasson's original Marxist discussion group in the St. Petersburg Technological Institute of r8go was Krup­ skaia. She joined the Brusnev circle in r8gr, met Lenin several months after his arrival in St. Petersburg in 1893, was arrested and exiled in r8g6 not long after Lenin, and married him in Siberia in r8g8. But the man who more than any other individual realized Krasin's dream of profession alizing Social Democratic cadres within St. Peters­ burg during the r8gos was a taciturn Ukrainian named Stepa n Rad­ chenko. From the time he joined the Brusnev circle in r8gr, he became in effect its leader.

He was perhaps the first truly professional apparatchik, a man not of grand plans, but of a hundred carefully executed detai ls: the relatively noble progenitor of an altogether frightening species. Nothing is known about his ac tivities from the time in 1887 he ar­ rived in St. Petersburg from Kiev to study at the Technological Institute until his first appearance in a Marxist circle in 1890. He clearly played an important role in deepening the links between intellectual circles and workers' organizatio ns, and his conspiratorial genius enabled him to be the sole member of the circle to elude arrest during the police crackdown in the summer of 1892. Radchenko became the first of the \"eternal students\" who were to become so charac teristic of later, Sta­ linist youth festivals-s taying on at the Technological Institute even after completing his courses in 1892 to continue the work of Brusnev.42 He brought Krzhizhanovsky into the revived circle in 1892 and Lenin the following year (along with both his and Lenin's future wives ). Just as Radchenko had accompanied Lenin at key moments in the 1893-95 period in St. Petersburg, so his wife Ludmilla Baranskaia subseque ntly accompanied Krupskaia in exile. Both before and after Lenin's Siberian exile, Radchenko's apartment was the site of more key meetings than anywhere else. Radchenko was part of the five-man inner directorate of the Union of Struggle in St. Petersburg in 1895-96; the sole delegate from St. Petersburg to the founding congress of the Russian Social Demo­ cratic Labor party at Minsk in 1898; a principal contact with Lenin when he returned from Siberia in February 1900; and the main repre­ sentative in St . Petersburg of Iskra later in the year. The crucial, simple fact about this ubiquitous yet strangely silent figure was that he was the man who could get things done. In a world of expansive talkers , he was the one who could act quickly and effec­ tively. He was the indispensable man who could, at short notice, find the place for a secure meeti ng,43 print a leaflet, forge a passport, find and deliver money, deliver and pick up mail, and provide supplies ranging from secret ink to statistical information. Radchenko's original circle in the early 189os was called \"the technolog ists.\" 44 He soon pro­ fession alized Krasin's circle of organizers , creating a \"technical bureau\" at its core, which became in many ways the only body to have a con­ tinuing existence amidst the fluid Social Democratic groups that pro­ liferated in St. Petersburg during the early 189os. Radchenko's style was radically different from either the courtroom histrionics of the revolutionary populists of the 187os or the icy bra­ vado of a Nechaev in prison disputing with his guards and fantasizing princely titles for himself. Radchenko avoided both the limelight and the prison cell, remaining perpetually, professionally, in the shadows. Though twice arrested, he was not held for long prior to 1902. The police could never find incrim inating materials on his p er s on .

Radchenko's pivotal role in early Social Democracy was, however, not just the result of faceless technical competence. He was looked to as the man who could communicate effectively between a hard core of revolution aries and a softer outer penumbra of sympathizers. He was thus not a secta rian conspirator, but a true apparatchik who expressed loyalty to the inner cause precisely by extending his contact outwa rd for purposes of recruitment, intell igence, and manipulation. In the words of a key contemporary and coworker, Radchenko was a leader in \"diplomatic relations with the legal Marxists and with other Social Democratic groups in the capital : and with different organizations of intellectuals, circles of writers , students, and cultural activ ists.\" 4 6 He was also a communications link between the earliest Marxists on the up­ per Volga (the followers of Fedoseev) and the emigres in Switzer land.4 7 Two factors in his youthful background helped Radchenko become apparat chik-in-chief of the St. Petersburg intell ectuals. He had been im­ mersed in the professional revolutionary traditions of the Ukraine and, at the same time, in the practical experience of dealing with working people. Radchenko was the second oldest of eleven children born to a merchant father of Cossack descent near Chernig ov, where he acquired a sense of regional pride in the native sons of that region ( Lizogub, Zheliabov, and Kibalchi ch) who had first infused revolutionaries in St. Petersburg with a commitment to terrori sm. He always referred to the student dining hall of the Technological Institute, where he recruited intellectuals for revolution ary activity , as the \"Zaporozhian Sech',\" the legendary site of Cossack freedom and self-determination on the lower ·Dnepr. He leaned heavily in all his activities on a kind of Ukrainian network. He retained close links with Kiev, which created the largest Union of Struggle outside St. Petersburg and provided half of the six organizations that met with Radchenko to form the Russia n Social Dem­ ocratic Labor party in 18g8. Radchenko appears to have depended on his brothers, his Ukrainian schoolmates, and his Ukrainian assistant, A. Malchenko, for the anonymous and variegated forms of assista nce he perpetually needed. When pressed to break his silence and explain where he procured supplies for his fellow revolution aries, he answered, \"through Polish technologists,\" 4H and his familiarity with the Polish language and Polish revolutionaries in the western Ukraine probably were sources of aid and support . In Janua ry 1894, after Martov received a doctor's permission to return to St. Petersburg, he counselled his revolutionary friends to cease thinking of themselves as displaced Jews and Poles, to stop fantasizing about \"broad plans, \" and \"to go humbly as 'students' to Radchenko and his 'elders' into the already existing Petersburg organization in the"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"The Path to Power: Lenin 4 5 7 same way that I went as a student to the Marxists in Vilnius.\" 49 Rad­ chenko's group absorbed and propagated Martov's theory of direct agi­ tation among workers , which had arisen from his contacts with Polish workers in prison and Jewish organizational work in Vilni us.5 0 Martov viewed Radchenko's pioneering work in reaching the working classes as an antidote to what he then charact erized as the \"Blanquism\" of most St. Petersburg-based revolution aries. \"1 Radchenko appears to have moved easily and invisibly among work­ ers in St. Petersburg.5 2 He introduced Lenin into his Sunday circle of workers when Lenin came to St. Petersburg briefly in the fall of 1891 to ascerta in conditions for entering the university. Radchenko at that time led both Lenin and the workers in the discussion of Marxism.53 He became \"the guide of other revolutionaries into the working milie u\"; 54 and Lenin , like everyone else, regarded him as \"our most skilled con­ spirator.\" G5 Radchenko arranged to finance and print most of the early Marxist attacks on the populists, including Lenin's What the \"Friends of the People\" Are of I 894; and it was in his flat that Lenin and other St. Petersburg Social Democrats proclaimed themselves a Union of Strug­ gle for the Liberation of the Working Class.5 6 Radchenko's importance increased after Lenin and other leaders were arrested in December 1895; and he played a leading role in the gathering of July 18, 1896, in a forest outside St. Petersburg where the Union of Strugg le organized itself for a further round of strikes.5' Arrested in August, he was re­ leased in November to assume uncontested command of the organi­ zation. He was its (and St. Petersburg' s) sole delegate to the founding conference of the Russian Social Democratic party at Minsk in 1898, and was probably responsible for inserting the word \"labor\" into the official name of the party. 5 H Radchenko played a decisive role in beating down the proposal of St. Petersburg workers to create a separate treasury for purely economic needs and struggl es.oH He thus anticipated Lenin's opposition to \"econ­ omism\" divorced from the political struggle. Indeed, he may even have originated this \"Leninist\" attitude. Recent Soviet archival research indi­ cates that Radchenko opposed Lenin's first advocacy of agitation among workers in the fall of 1894 as a repudiation of revolutionary militancy in favor of \"the fight 'for a five-copeck piece,' 'for boiling water' and for other economic demands.\" oo Thus from the time he was released from prison late in November I8g6 until he was rearrested in 1902 and exiled for the remaining nine years of his life, Radchenko was the most important single leader among St. Petersburg Social Democrats. During this period, a remarkably com­ mon set of assumptions developed among profess ional Social Demo­ cratic organizers . With the exception of a few aristocratic intellectuals like Struve, who always believed in freedom more than in equality, most Social Democrats accepted conspiratorial means to accomplish social revolution . They believed that both general Marxist propaganda and specific proletarian agitation were needed to produce a popular \"party\" that would be more than an intellectual \"se ct. \" n1 Even Martov, the future Menshevik and leader of the \"young\" rivals to the Radchenko-"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"T HE R ISE OF THE S OCIAL R EVOLUTIONARIES Lenin \"elders,\" preached the need for \"a conspiratorial organization\" to be \"embedded in a wide social democratic party.\" 6 2 Russian revolutionary Social Democrats were deeply disturbed by the sudden appearance of \"economism,\" the Russian form of the reformist German \"revision ism.\" After a severe crackdown on the Union of Struggle in December 1895, strikers in 18g6-97 had turned away from militant Social Democratic object ives towards the pursuit of purely economic goals. Almost immediately after the founding of the new Russian Social Democratic Labor party, both its designated official party organizat ion in the emigration (The Union of Russian Social Democrats Abroad) and its official journal within the Russian Empire ( Rabochee Delo, \"the workers' cause\") accepted the new emphasis on attainable economic goals rather than unrealistic political revolution ary plans. In I 8gg, there was a new and more violent turn to labor unrest ( cen­ tered among metallurgical workers in St. Petersburg and the Ukrai ne) and a marked revival of student unres t. Lenin and the other exiled agitators of an earlier era sent from Siberia a \"protest of the seven­ teen\" against the drift of Social Democracy away from revolution . In that final year of exile, Lenin devised the basic implements for building a new revolutionary party to check the drift to reformism and mobilize the new unrest. He began with that basic building block of modern revolutionary organize rs : a three-man, central cell. In correspondence with Martov and Potresov, Lenin spoke of them as the \"troika\" or \"triple alliance\" who would accomplish the \"conquest of the party\" upon their release.63 Their main weapon was to be the favored device of totalistic revolu­ tionaries since Bonneville's Tribun du Peuple and Bouche de Fer: an ideological-political journal. Its title Iskra (The Spark ) and its epi­ graph, \"from the spark comes the flame,\" revived a class ic metaphor; and Lenin extended it by calling his journal \"an enormous bellows that would blow every spark ... into a general blaze.\" 6 4 Lenin went abroad with Potresov, allied himself with Plekhanov and other anti-economist emig res, and began publishing Iskra in December I goo in Germany with Krupskaia as co-editor. In \"Where to begin ?,\" pub­ lished in the fourth issue in May Igoi, Lenin summoned up the Bonne­ ville -Babeuf image of a newspaper as a \"tribune\" designed to \"awaken in all strata of the people ... a passion for political arraig nments.\" 6 3 The central newspaper became for Lenin \"not only a collect ive prop­ agandist and collective agitator, but also a collective organiz er.\" \"Tech­ nical work itself\" for the new journal would create \"the net of local agents for a unified party ... accustomed to execute regularly detailed functions on a nationwide scale.\" 66 The very process of distributing the journal involved creating the nucleus of a new party : \"a network of agents that would automatically form itself in the process of establishing and distributing a common newspaper . . . doing precisely such regular work as would guarantee the greatest proba bility of success in the case of an upris ing.\" 67 Thus, Lenin blend ed-a s none since the Saint-Simonians had-t he concept of a central journal of ideological indoc trination with a system"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"The Path to Power: Lenin 4 59 of nationwide organiz ation dedicated to social revoluti on. Lenin added the element of conspiratorial organization that originated with Babeuf and reached a new intensity in the Russian revolutionary tradition . The product ion of Iskra became intertwined with the perfeeting of cyphe rs, pseudonyms, and false addre sses; while the press was also used for such tasks as printing false passports (Bulgarian and German being easier than Russian to forge ). uH The flow of information out of Russia and the distribution of the journal in from the editorial center in Munich involved a clandestine transportation system which operated through a host of illegal centers and, by 1903, involved some one th ou­ sand Iskrovtsy.69 A number of Lenin's former comrades helped form local Iskra cells in the regions where they were sent after Siberian exile : Krasin in the Caucasus , Malchenko in Nizhni-Novgoro d, and Martov, the third of Lenin's \"triumvi rs,\" in and around Poltava.7° Radchenko's wife also set off for Poltava in the summer of 1goo, launching a remarkable family effort to weave a net of supporters throughout Russia. Lenin had al­ most certai nly relied on the Radchenkos for local arrangements earlier in 1900, when he stopped off in Pskov en route from Siberia to West­ ern exile .7 1 Radchenko's wife (known as \"Pasha\" and direktor sha-the \"directr ess\") helped organize succes sively the two most important Ukrainian centers for Iskra and the southern transportation route for smuggling the journal from abroad.72 Radchenko's younger brother Ivan (known as \"Arkady\" and \"Kas'ian\" ) set up a secret press in Kishinev which began reprinting Iskra on Russian soil.n Stepan himself became the principal agent in St. Petersburg, and Lenin asked him in April to set up a kind of bibliographical review board for Iskra of works pub­ lished inside Russia. Lenin first asked him to enlist for the Iskra net the young intellec­ tuals who had formed the revolutionary extremist group Sotsialist, and then dispatched an emissary to work through Radchenko in setting up a r egular organization in St. Petersburg that would link Iskra with the remains of the Union of Strugg le.74 In the late summer of 1901, the \"director\" was renamed \"general\" in a kind of battlefield promotion for Radchenko by the revolutionary underground .76 Up until his arrest a nd the effective end of his career on December 4, 1901 , he played a key role in the \"socialist postal service\" used to distribute the jour­ nal-the trunks with concealed compartment s, the dummy addresses ( iavki), the writing of messages in invisible ink between the lines of innocuous publications (so-called lastochki or \"swallows\" ). 76 When his arrest was followed by that of his wife, his brother Ivan took over leader­ ship of the St. Petersburg bureau of Iskra and played a leading role in the Organizational Committee formed inside Russia to prepare for a congress of the Social Democratic party. He represented Iskra at the preparatory conference in Pskov before he, too, was arrested late in 1902. Though they were unsuccessf ul in forming stable, central leadership within Russia, the Iskra groups did succeed in spreading propaganda and new agitational techniques into many local settings. The charac-"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"T HE R ISE OF THE S ociAL R EvoLUTIONARIES teristic structure was a small inner cell of organizers (often with a name like Spartacus ), which would publish fly sheets weekly and dis­ tribute them widely (sometimes in colored paper in children's schools or thrown randomly into theaters when the lights went down ). The organizers would also arrange small meet ings of twenty-five to thirty committed Social Democrats to discuss contemporary problems ( letuchki or flying meeti ngs) and larger gatherings of thirty to one hundred fifty that included nonparty sympat hizers ( massovki or mass meetings ) .77 The Organizational Committee for Iskra inside Russia first began the widespread usage of the word partiiny (party-spirit ed)-often rein­ forced with the prefix obshche, indicating a common, overall, or higher party spirit.7H Lenin was responding to Marx's earlier call for a \"party in the great historical sense\" : a revolutionary body capable of con­ quering power. Partiinost' in this sense was the direct opposite of that amateurism in technique and provincialism of perspective described by the term kustarnichestvo, a word Lenin began using regul arly to denounce the sloppiness in method and absorption in local concerns that Iskra or­ ganizers found dominant within the masses themselve s. Just as econ­ omism might blunt the revolutionary aims of a \"party in the great historical sense,\" so kustarnichestvo might blunt its centralized disci­ pline. The word had been used traditionally to descr ibe the primitive methods of home industries in Russia. Lenin clearly preferred methods of revolutionary organizat ion appropriate to the modern industrial era of large-scale fac tories. He needed his \"directors\" no less than did the bourgeois owners of fa ctorie s; his \"generals\" no less than the tsarist protectors of privile ge. In December 1901 (the very month that \"the general,\" Stepan Rad­ chenko, was arrest ed), Lenin first used the pseudonym \"N. Lenin\" un­ der which he was to become comm ander-in-chief of the revolutionary army .79 His articles in Iskra can be thought of as revolutionary com­ muniqu es-us ually focused on a single theme which was often redu­ cible to a single slogan, invariably enlisting emotion as well as intellect in the pursuit of some immediate goal.Ho Lenin saw all his Iskra associ­ ates as engaged in a kind of basic training for a future revoluti on, \"doing precisely such regular work as would guarantee the greatest probability of success in the case of an uprising.\" 8 1 Like any other modern army, Lenin's Bolshevik party depended on the invisible work of trained technicia ns: apparatchiki like the Radchen­ kos. Their professional anonymity has made it almost impossible to reconstruct the full story of what they did to create a Social Democratic party; but it is possible to identify another place in St. Petersburg that played at the turn of the century almost as important a role as the Technological Institute. The German model of Social Democracy was in some ways transmitted and transformed into a dynamic new Russian revolutionary organization through the new Siemens-Halske factory in St. Petersburg. Radchenko went to work there after his expulsion from the Technological Institute in 1893; and his technical duties en abled him to have constant access to the means of transport ation and com-"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"The Path to Power: Lenin munication for the Iskra net.H2 Krzhizhanovsky likewise used his train­ ing as an electrical engineer to set up the most important single center of Iskra activity in the interior (in Samara ); 8 � and he was later stra­ tegically placed for Bolshevik organizational work by Leonid Krasin, who had worked for Siemens in Germany and returned to resume Bolshe vik activity in Russia as an official Siemens representati ve : first as head of the Mosco w branch and supervisor of its electrification program and thence to St. Petersburg as head of all Siemens operations in Russia.R 4 Thus, some of the dynamism of the Russian prolet arian party came from the German capitalist firm that had invented the dynamo. Krasin inherited Stepan Radchenko's revolutionary nickname, \"di­ rector\" ; 85 and he- like the other original technologist-apparatchiks­ would play an important role in the management of the new Soviet state .H\" But the man who turned all their tactical technology into revo­ lutionary strategy was, of course, Lenin himself. The Master Builder The most distinctive feature of Lenin was his single-minded focus on political power.H7 He was, as we have seen, a professional revolut ionary before he became a Marx ist; and he related his new doctrine more insistently to the struggle for power than had Marx himself. It is al­ most impossible to conceive of Lenin in exile following the example set by Marx of writing miscellaneous paid articles for the \"bourgeois\" press and devoting years of his life to a purely theoretic al magnum opus like Capital. He was never as much at home in the British Museum as was Marx, the doctor of philosophy from Berlin in its golden age. Lenin studied fitfully and wrote rapidly. His prem aturely abbreviated university career immersed him not in classica l philosophy, but in the most political subject it was possible to study in Kazan and St. Peters­ burg : the law. Lenin had adopted Marxism as a necessary alternative to the populist path for destroying autocracy. He adopted Marxism not as an open body of criticism for understanding society, but as a finished bluepr int for changing it. In contrast to many other Marxist intell ectuals in Russia, Lenin adhered almost uncritically to the main schema of Marxism until the final push to power in 1917, modifying the doctrine only slightly during and after the Revolution of 1905. During his period of exile prior to that revolution, as we have seen, Lenin created a \"party of a new type\" to lead the struggle . In so doing, he followed more the Marx who periodic ally identified with Blanqui than the Marx and Engels who later accommodated themselves to German Social Democra cy. In Iskra, journal though it was, Lenin was not de-"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"THE RISE OF THE SociAL REvoLUT IONARIES fining a doctrine so much as driving towards a destination. In his first sketch of a battle plan, \"A Letter to a Comrade on our Organiza­ tional Tasks,\" he described himself as leading an orchestra. The con­ ductor needs to know \"precisely who is playing which violin and where ... who is playing wrongly ... and who should be transferred how and where in order to correct the dissonance.\" 88 His self-image in What Is To Be Done? is that of a master builder who \"lays down a thread ... visible to everyone\" so that individual bricklayers will have a line to follow-ea ch laying separate bricks yet realizing that there is a \"final goal of the common work.\" 89 Lenin was not so much defining a general line as threading a specific path. As he attempted to orches­ trate the sounds coming from Russia, he heard two major forms of dissonance. His special genius lay in demonstr ating that discord from both \"right\" and \"left\" had the same basic source: \"spont aneity.\" The necessa ry counterforce to such discord was \"consciousness,\" the source of discipline within an otherwise amorphous movement. But consciousness must be a source of discipli ne, not dissipation. There­ fore, Lenin's tract began with an assault on \"freedom of criticism\" as a dangerous slogan that would inevitably dilute revolutionary militance into democratic reformi sm.D° Freedom of criticism gave rise to \"oppor­ tunism,\" \"economism,\" and \"trade unionism\" by blunting the basic Marxist belief in the class struggle as the moving force of history. Un­ aided by the higher \"consciousness\" of a revolut ionary ideology, the working class everywhere risked being limited to its \"spontaneous\" impulse to satisfy immediate wants. They became vulnerable thereby to the bribery of the bourgeoisie , which was made ideologically re­ spectable by the ideology of \"economism.\" But the terrorists on the Left also indulged in the sin of spontaneity. As the bourgeois intell ectuals , they could not transcend their class origin s. The working class as a result became infected with \"the spon­ taneity of the hottest indignation of the intellectuals\" that produced random violence without cumulat ive effect.91 Thus Lenin introduced the chiaroscuro technique of modern com­ munist polemi cs : the brightening of a changing line by the darkening of rivals on either side into \"left\" and \"right\" deviations : terrorism and economism, \"adven turism\" and \"tail-endis m,\" left and right \"liqui­ dators\" after the failure of revolut ion in 1905, and finally in the post­ revolut ionary era, the \"infantile disorder\" of \"leftism\" and the \"boot­ licking\" \"capitul ationism\" of \"the renegade Kautsky.\" o 2 Stalin ritualized this process into a formula of rule by alternat ing purges of \"left\" and \"right\" (beginning with Trotsky and Bukh arin respec tively).93 For Lenin, however, Marxism was the ideolog ical cement needed for a harassed revolutionary movement-not pliable putty for a purveyor of power. Rather than more \"theories of revolutionar ies,\" the Russian movement required a \"revolutionary theory\" and a \"conscious\" van­ guard able to interpret and implement it. Thus Lenin issued his call for a secret, hierarchical organization of full-time professional revolu­ tionaries to build a new ty p e of party.

The relationship of his vanguard party to the working class was rather like that of a central nervous system to the body. It was indispensable to the body, but equally inseparable from it. Individual cells within this nervous system were thus insep­ arably bound both to the system of which they were a subordinate part and to the particular part of the body in which it funct ioned. Th us, \"the centra lization of the secret functions of the organizat ion does not at all mean the centra lization of all the functions of the movement. \" 94 Leninists were obliged to participate in all forms of ac­ tivity that were genuine expressions of proletarian class interest (\"the movement\" ) but to owe their basic allegia nce at all times to the party : the organ of \"consciousness\" that alone gave the movement direction . From the beginnin g, therefore , there was a kind of provisional quality to the allegiance of any Leninist to anything outside his own elite organizat ion. Lenin left no doubt of his determination to enforce that discipli ne, placing on his title page as if in answer to the question of the title itself : What Is To Be Done? the citation from a letter of Lassa lle to Marx during the period when both were close to Blanqui : ... Party struggle lends a party strength and vitality, the greatest proof of the weakness of a party is its diffuseness and the blunting of strongly de­ fined boundaries, a party strengthens itself by purging itself . . .. 9 \" Lenin waged his struggle at the Second Congress of the Russian So­ c ial Democratic Labor party held in Brussels and London from July 17 through August 10, 1903. He emerged at the end with both the name and the nucleus for his \"party of a new type,\" Bolshevism. His faction took its name, \"the majority,\" from the position it gained by following what was to become a classic \"Bolshev ik\" technique : sheer persistence in pressing positions and never leaving meetings . Lenin was in a clear minority in the crucial voting on the definition of a party member, when the congress formally rejected Lenin's insistence on a definition that emphasized central discipline and a full-time commitmen t.96 But Lenin persevere d; and the majority support for Ma rtov's more demo­ cratic formulation eroded when representatives of the Jewish Bund and the \"economists\" left the congress in protest over other issues. Lenin used his temporary majority to elect his followers to the board of Iskra, officially designated as the central organ of the party, and to the Central Committee. Although by the end of the year Lenin was to lose this majo rity on Iskra (and later on the Central Committee ), Bol­ shevism was born ; and the larger, but more democratically disputa­ tious group within the Social Democratic party was permanently adorned with the label of Menshevik, or \"minor ity.\" 97 Through a long series of tactical struggles with the Mensheviks in­ volving many shifting alliances, Lenin consistently refused to compro­ mise his concept of democrat ic centralism for the sake of some dem­ ocratic consensu s.

After forming his new type of party, his major accomplishment was retooling its Marxist ideology for use in the less-developed world that the partly Asian, largely peasa nt Rus­ sian Empire represented. The first step was the explicit accommodat ion of bourgeois intellec­ tuals within the prolet arian vanguard. Just as a mysterious transforma­ tion of personal identity was thought to have occurred upon entering the inner circle of the original Bavar ian Illuminis ts, so upon entering Lenin's party \"any distinction between workers and intellectuals must be com­ pletely obliterated .\" 1 o o The class function of this party was, in effect, to rebaptize intellectuals like Lenin as full-fledged prolet arian s. Such a ritual was essential because intell ectuals were indispensable to any revolu tion­ ary elite. 1 o1 Explicit sanction for bourgeois intellectual leadership was essential in countries totally dependent for leadership on a small edu­ cated elite. Immediately after the Party Congress of 1903, Lenin appealed energ etically to \"revolutionary students\" to raise their own \"conscious­ ness\" by accepting his leadership . 1o 2 Even more innovative was Lenin's willingness to accommodate the peasa ntry within his alliance of progressive forces. Using an indus­ trial metaphor, he was later to speak of a meta l fusion ( smychka ), or \"clamp,\" joining workers and poor peasants. In his lengthy writings on the \"rural poor\" in 1902-3, he relied on Kautskian analysis and German illustrati ons, seeing hope for the peasa ntry only in their conversion into a rural prolet ariat of wage worke rs. But once revolution broke out in 1905, he immediately sensed the inadequacy of the classical Marxist formula of a \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" as the prescribed form of revolutionary rule. In early March 1905, he sketched the outline for an article suggesting that the proletariat and the poor peasantry together constituted the \"real bearers of this revolution .\" He expressed fear that an isolated uprising by the proleta riat might lead only to a \"spontaneous dictatorship of the proletariat,\" 10 :1 which would presum­ ably be drowned in a counte r-revolut ionary tide as was the insurgent Paris proletariat in June 1848. At rival party congresses held in April 1905 the Bolsheviks showed more active interest than the Mensheviks in inciting and organizing the peasa ntry, even while recog nizing the rural masses to be \"spontaneous and politically unconscious . \" 10· ( Then in the summer of 1905, Lenin's Two Tactics set forth a Marxist redefinit ion of the provisional govern­ ment in a post-revolutionary society as a \"revolutionary-democratic dic­ tatorship of the proletariat and the peasan try .\" 105"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"The Path to Power: Lenin Lenin returned to Russia from his Swiss exile in November 1905 during the unrest of the general strike into what he then called \"the revolutionary whirl wind.\" Two months of ill-fated incitement to armed insurrection were followed by two years of organizational consolida­ tion within a Social Democratic party that was nominally united at the Stockholm Congress in April 1906 and formally acknowledged the principle of \"democratic centralism .\" 10 G Lenin urged boycotting the elec­ tions to the first Dum a and taking part in the elections to the second; but as the Dumas were prorogued and reactionary rule descended, he once more retreated to the emigration in November 1907. His major work in exile (Materialism and Empiriocriticism of 1908) seems to any educated Western mind an unusua lly dated and turgid exercise in polemic overkill against long-since-forgotten philosophers of science. Yet this work was important to Lenin in defending the claim of Marxism to represent scientific truth. His insistence on the scientific nature of his own Marxism intensified its appea l to the weste rnized elites of the less-developed lands. For them, Western science repre­ sented less an introduction to the experimental method of the labora­ tory than the acceptance of ultimate truths capable of shattering the shackles of traditional religion. Lenin's party of a new type provide d, thus, a vehicle not just for the ambitions of intell ectuals-but also for their quasi-religious visions of apocalyptical social transformat ion and their quasi-familial need for rituals of belonging and reassura nce. His combination of political intensity and scientistic pretensions pro­ duced an important modification in the Marxist attitude towards re­ ligion. On the one hand , his attitude prior to the outbreak of revolu­ tion in 1905 was politically pragmatic and far more flexible than the Mensheviks and other Marxists. Iskra made extensive use of the estab­ lished channels for smuggling religious books into Russia; 107 and in What Is To Be Done? Lenin saw many of the persecuted sectarian reli­ gions in Russia providing \"a means and occasion for political agitation, for drawing the masses into political struggle .\" 108 At the Congress of 1903, one of Lenin's closest associates urged an alliance with these \"popular democratic elements\" in the struggle against \"bourgeois de­ mocracy .\" He argued that Social Democrats could help raise the \"polit­ ical consciousness of the millions who comprise the people's democ­ racy,\" 109 and launched a journal Rassvet (The Dawn) and a campaign with Lenin's approval to work with religious dissen ters \"in order to draw them to Social Democracy .\" 11o Once the Revolution of 1905 was underway, however, Lenin turned from being merely anticlerical to being militantly antirel igious. At the very height of revolutionary expectations late in the year, Lenin broke decisively with what had been the standa rd position of European So­ cial Democrats since the Gotha program- religion was a privat e matter. He insisted that while religious beliefs might be private in relation to the state, \"under no circumstances can we consider religion to be a private matter with regard to our own party. \" 11 1 No past religion nor any future religion, even of the proletariat itsel£,112 was acceptable. The \"science\" of"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"T HE R ISE OF THE S OCIAL R EVOLUTIONARIES Marxism was both necess ary and sufficient for salvation, with Lenin an infallible and solely secular pope. Lenin's doctrine had a special appeal to intellectuals from oppressed nation alities within and beyond the Russia n Empi re. Basically, he fore­ saw an end to all national identity in the coming universal social revoluti on, and already at the 1903 Congress had expre ssed the cen­ tralizer's hatred and suspicion of the federal principle which dated back to the Jacobins' critique of the Girondists. But in his first writ­ ing on the national question in 1903 he recognized that the \"autonomy\" of oppressed nationalities might be necess ary under Russian condi­ tions,11a and hailed the entry of \"inflammable material into world politics\" 1 14 when the revolution in Russia was followed by an upheaval of 1906 in Persia and by the Young Turk revolt of 1908 in the Otto­ man Empi re. Lenin was open to the thought that \"the European worker has Asian comrades,\" and violently opposed the support of any na­ tional cause in World War I. He opposed the war effort with a small but energetic group of left-wing Social Democrats in Switzerland dur­ ing 1914 -16, and went beyond the others in favoring the defeat of his own country ,11 5 His crowning work of this period codified for the less developed na­ tions an easily understandable demonology. 116 Imperialism was the \"high­ est\" or final stage of capitalism, and war was its inevitable by-pro duct. War was not the conscious policy of anyone, but the form of convulsive collapse that capitalism assumed in its last stage, when the large capital­ ist states were consuming the smaller ones as well as their own and the external proletar iat. The task of the proletariat was to turn the imperial­ ist war among nations into a civil war among classes . Lenin's theory of imperialism escalated the class struggle to the level of a global apocaly pse. In this last stage , the European bourgeoisie had lost all its progressive features of an earlier era. It was now dom­ inated by parasitic bankers who performed no entrepreneurial function and, in effect, started war \"by clipping coupons .\" In the less developed Asian lands, Lenin believed the bourgeoisie might still have revolu­ tionary potential, however ; and one of the first proclamations of the new Bolshevik regime was its \"Declaration of the Rights of Toiling and Exploited People.\" Like the nine-headed beast in the Book of Revelation, the \"ravening beasts\" of finance capitalism were for Lenin a sign that the end of his­ tory was near. The millennium, of course, was the coming classless society. And just as the antichrist preceded the true Christ in Christian eschatology, so the imperialist war had concentrated power and mo­ bilized the masses in ways that would make a proleta rian take-over easier. The chance for power came late in World War I, when the Russia n Empire was staggered by the loss of five million killed and fifteen million removed from the economy. As winter set in in 1916 with a dwindling grain supply and Soo percent inflation, Russia was rocked by three success ive shock waves. First came the revolt \"from above \""},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"The Path to Power: Lenin of moderate liberals, the so-called \"progressive bloc\" in the Duma. They killed Rasputin, the symbol of imperial decadence, in Janua ry 1917, and sought to set up a regency under the Grand Duke Michael that would provide responsible , constitutional government with civil rights and local autonomy. Second came insurgency \"from below\" on March 8, 1917, when demonstrations led to fighting in St. Petersburg with one thousand casualties and to the replacement of tsardom by a Provisional Government pledged to convene a Constituent Assembly. At the same time the executive committee of the St. Petersburg Soviets set up an independent workers' authority which grew steadily alongside the power of the provisional democratic government and created coun­ terparts in other cities during the brief period between the end of tsar­ dom in March 1917 and the success of Bolshevism in November. The third shock wave was the Bolsheviks' coup d'etat in November 1917 , engineered and led by Lenin after his return from Switzerland to St. Petersburg in April . Lenin brought with him the aura of an au­ thentic alternative to the suffering and quarreling of war-torn Russia; and he proved himself in the dazzling six months leading up to his own revolution , a master tactician bordering on genius. His first and most essential step was to identify himself in a time of total confusion with the most utopian of all revolutionary positio ns : the anarchist vision of an imminent end to all authority. Lenin recog­ nized that in a time when traditional ties have been severed, the most extreme position may suddenly become the most practical one for mobilizing the masses. Thus, just after the fall of the tsar and before returning to Russia, Lenin asked for Bakunin's writings on the Paris Commune. He proceeded to write his great and influential treatise of the revolutionary year, State and Revolution. It was a work of anarchist fantasy-to be sure, a fantasy once shared with Bakunin briefly by Marx during their period of common excitement over the creative potential of the new forms of worker self-governance thrown up by the Paris Commune. With the passion of an anarch ist, Lenin rejected the parliamentary bodies of the bourgeoisie, who were seen as putting brakes on the revolutionary process. Lenin saw this as one of those periods when history was moving like a racing locomotive rather than a \"slow freighter.\" 11 7 At such a time, there was a need for the \"arming of the whole people\" and the spontaneous political formation of \"the peo­ ple constituted in communes. \" At such a moment the \"conscious\" van­ guard party must put itself in tune with the \"spontaneous \" popular movement, which sought to smash the oppressive structures of the past and to create \"democracy without parliamentarism. \" 1 18 Reaffirm­ ing all the while his \"scien tific\" Marxist authority, Lenin suggested that the total smashing of the bourgeois state was immi nent. The \"dic­ tatorship of the proletariat and poor peasantry\" that was to follow the revolution would \"wither away\" in the very near future. Since all coer­ cion had its roots in class oppression, all instruments of coercion would simply vanish in the classless society. In Lenin's astonishingly"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"THE R ISE OF THE S ociAL R EVOLUTIONARIES utopian image, any conflict or excess after a successful proletarian r evolution would require \"no special machine, no special apparatus of suppression.\" This will be done by the armed people themselves as simply and as read­ ily as any crowd of civilized people even in modern society interferes to put a stop to a scuffle or to prevent a woman from being assaulted .l 1 9 Having maintained Marxist orthodoxy during his long years of emi­ gration , Lenin suddenly appropriated not just this dream of the anar­ chists, but the most visionary ideas of almost all his other revolution­ ary competitors as well. He took over the Mens heviks' long-standing insistence on the Soviets as a major instrument for proletarian politi­ cal expression and promoted it as the only instrument of political legit­ imacy (his slogan \"All power to the Soviets !\"). He annexed the Socialist Revolutionaries' long-standing call for the direct peasant expropriation of the land (adding \"bread and land\" to his already established call for \"peace\" to make a trinity of popular demands ). And he took over the hitherto rejected view of Trotsky and Parvus that revolut ion in Russia could directly \"grow over\" in an \"uninterrupted\" procession from a bourgeois-democratic to a proletarian phas e. 1 2 o Lenin also suddenly embraced a gifted group of brilliant, deracinated intellectuals that he had previously held at arm's length. They provided the indispensable orator ical and organizational talent for mobilizing the masses. His companion on the sealed train that brought him back to Russia was a gifted Polish-Jewish revolutionary who had been active on the left wing of the German moveme nt: Karl Sobelsohn, who had taken his revolutionary name \"Radek\" from the hero of a novel modeled on Machajski,1 21 and he became a principal emissary of Lenin to the out­ side world during the early days of the new regim e. Upon arrival, Lenin recruited a like-minded anti-intell ectual group of intellectuals in St. Petersburg headed by Trotsky and known as the inter-regional group (mezhraionka). 1 22 These magicians of the word were essential for the mobilization of the mind that rapidly took place. Two of the newly baptized Bolsheviks-Lunacharsky and Trotsky-dazzled the working classes of St. Petersburg with their oratory conducting a kind of nightly revolutionar y variety show at the Cirque Modeme, which became a popular rallying and reunion center rather like the Cirque of the Palais­ Royal in Paris in the early days of the original French Revolution. As other organized bodies disinteg rated, the smallness of Lenin's fol­ lowing seemed less of a drawback, and the tightness of his organiza­ tion more of an advantage. But the final source of strength was the quality of total self-discipline that he bore within himself. To be sure, the Bolshevik party grew ten times from its low point of 25,000 at the time of the March Revolution to the take-over of St. Petersburg six months later. But it was the disciplined generalship of Lenin that en­ abled this still relatively small political group to lead a revolution and t otally dominate the new regime. If there was one external element that was decisive in enab l ing the Bolsheviks to overthrow Kerensky's Provisional Government late in"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"The Path to Power: Lenin 1917 , it was clearly the decision of the conserv ative military leader, General Kornilov, to march on Petrograd and fatally cripple the Pro­ visional Government from the Right. This action from one extreme weakened the centrist government of Kerensky and enabled the other extreme to assume increasing leadership in the capital. This dramatic dependence of the Left on the Right at the threshold of power points to a deeper element in the rise of Leninism and in the history of the mode rn revolutionary tradit ion generally. It is to this dark subject that attention must next be turned. The Symbiosis of Extremes The revolutionary tradi tion returned in early twentieth-cen tury Russia to its original pattern of early ninet eenth-century Franc e. As under Napoleon I, so under Nicholas II, revolutio nary leaders were elite con­ spirators hounded into secretive methods by political police. In both eras, revolutionaries sought to terminate autocracy with assass ination and to challenge imperial domination with democratic ideology. Most important of all the similarities between the age of the first French emperor and the age of the last Russian emperor was the in­ teraction of the extremes. In Russia even more than in France, the Left and the Right deeply influe nced each other. The symbiosis of extremes became a fateful and enduring feature of the Russia n revolutionary tradition. In the first decade of the nineteenth century, extreme republicans and royalist \"ultras\" had been thrown together in conspiracy against Napoleon. The head of the react ionary political police that combatted the revolutionaries for Napoleon had previously been a fanatical revo­ lutionary commissioner and apostle of la revolution integrale. 1 2 3 The seminal figure within the Babeuf Conspiracy, Sylvain Marechal, appea rs to have survived through some kind of special indulgence from, if not relationship with, the police. But the perhaps inevitable symbiosis between revolutionary conspir­ ators and the police who pursue them was to reach an ever greater pitch of intimacy and intensity in the Russia n setting. Because the police presence was so all-pervasive in late-imperial Russia, it influ­ enced both the Russian revolutionary movement and the political struc­ ture that the movement produced after gaining power. The growth of a secret political police arm of the Right in Russia was, from the beginning, linked with the development of revolutionary organization on the Left. The \"Third Section\" of the Imperial Russian Chancery had been created in direct react ion to the Decembrist up­ rising of 1825. Though de jure a part of the tsar's chancery, it remained a small organiz ation , dependent in practice on a highly visible blue-"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"47 0 T HE R ISE OF THE S ociAL R EVOLUTIONARIES uniformed gendarmery. It had ceased to be effect ive long before it was abolished in 188o, for it was able to deal only with individua ls, not organization s. The revolutionary movement had entered the stage of professional organization in Russia, and the police were to respond in kind. The modern Russian secret police origin ated with the formation of a special \"division for the defense of order (po ohhrane poriadka ) and security\" in the St. Petersburg police after the first attempt on the life of the tsar in 1866. Amidst the renewal of assassin ation s, a new Depart­ ment of State Police was created in 188o with special sections for the defense of order in Moscow and Warsaw. l 24 The new secret organiza­ tion enjoyed nothing like the privileged position outside the bureau­ cracy of the tsar's recently abolished Third Section. It began only as a small ad hoc group of special security sections ( okhrannye otdeleniia) of the police, under an assistant minister of the interior. But-pa rticu­ larly after the establishment of a secure headqua rters on the fifth floor of the police headqu arters in St. Petersburg in 1898-t he Okhr ana (Watchguard ), as it was incorrectly but persistently called, became a vast police empire . Seven new sections were set up in the provinces in 1902; and authority was invested in new security regions (ohhrannye okrugi), which numbered between seventeen and twenty-six by 1914 with twenty-six special sections and perhaps as many as seventy-seven district offices. 12 5 The reorg anization in 1883 of the Department of State Police into the Department of Police with the function of political security pro­ duced an organizational structure to match the professionalism of the revolutionar ies. The police relied on emergency powers created by the Law of August 1881, which permitted virtual military dictatorship in any area where \"conditions of alarm\" had been created among the populace. This \"extraor dinar y power of defense\" ( chrezvychainaia okh­ rana) 1 2 6 could be introduced only with the approval of the tsar, but was in fact often invoked for the remaining years of the Russian Em­ pire. The secret police of the Soviet era also began its even more exten­ sive secret police operations as an \"extraordinary commissi on\" ( chrezvy­ chainaia komissiia-Cheka) under supposed ly tempor ary and emergency conditio ns. Alexander III's antirevolutionary campaign was initially led by an emergency organization formed directly within the imperial court : the Sacred Brotherhood ( sviashchennaia druzhina). It published a journa l of provocation in Geneva called Pravda (Truth) in an effort to discredit the revolutionaries by its extremi sm. The Brotherhood planned to as­ sassinate prominent revolutionaries abroad even while negotiating with others for their agreement not to disrupt the new tsar's coronati on. But this organization was dissolved in November 1882 when the emer­ gency had passed ; and its files were turned over to a new foreign section ( zagranichnaia agentura) of the Police Department, which became in effect the overseas branch of the Okhran a. The resultant growth of overseas police activities centered on the Paris embassy inclined the Russian Empire toward growing dependence"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"The Path to Power: Lenin 47 1 on France, where the traditions of agents provocat eurs and paid inform­ ers had reached a new sophistication under Napoleon III, 1 2 7 and where the Paris Commune had left conservatives in a state of perpetua l coun­ terrevolution ary vigilance. The system of prisoner identification and police filing on which the success of the Okhrana was based (the Ber­ tillon system ) was imported wholesale from France. 12 8 The Paris-based antirevolution ary campa ign provided a testing ground for the Okhrana's strategy of parallel reliance on external informers and internal penetration of revolution ary groups. A leader of the for­ eign agentura, Peter Rachkovsky, broke up the last emigre press of the People's Will in Geneva in 1886. His subsequent discovery of revolu­ tionaries with bombs in Paris in 1890 was publicized in such a way as to discredit the revolutiona ry movement before liberal opinion and to help ease the way for further Russ o-French police cooperation in the years leading up to the historic alliance between the two governments in 1894. l 2 9 Inside Russia, the techniques of penetration and provocation devel­ oped rapidly within the secret police. Many of the police leaders were Ba ltic German disciplinarians like V. K. Plehve, who became director of the Police Department in 1881, deputy minister of the interior from 1884 to 1892, and minister of the interior and chief of gendarmes from 1902 until he was blown up by a terrorist bomb in July 1904. Southern Russia, from whence terrori st violence first came to St. Peters­ burg in the 187os, became the main staging ground for governmental coun ter-violence in the 188os. Kiev was referred to as skorpion (the scorpion ) in the usually anodyne coding system of the Okhrana ,ls o Gen­ eral Strelnikov, who initiated mass searches, arrests, and pogroms in Kiev, was assassinated in March r882 by Stepa n Khalturin, who had pre­ viously tried to blow up the Winter Palace and became the last success­ ful assas sin-m artyr of the People's Will. In response, the police developed a new professionalism exemplified by Lt. Col. Gregory Sudeikin of the St. Petersburg Okhrana. He began recruiting political prisoners to be double agents, as in the case of Serge Degaev, who became a police agent inside the surviving leader­ ship of the People's Will. Though Degaev later changed his mind and assassi nated Sude ikin as a kind of propiti atory act,l:l 1 the damage had been done . The precedent had been established for the confusion of identities between the rival clandestine empires of Right and Left within the Russian Empire . Sudeikin argued with seeming sincerity that only collaboration between the Okhrana and the People's Will could institute the reforms that Alexander II had promoted through liberal institutions. This argument that reform in Russia could occur only through, and not in opposition to, the police had apparently persuaded Degaev to collaborate with the Okhran a. The continued sparring between the police and revolution aries took place in a twilight world of tacit understand ings , personal alliances, and even mutual admir ation . Close combat sometimes led to secret embrace.

Pasternak revived the name of Strelnikov, the original apostle of violence on the Right, as the name for his per­ sonification of the revolutionary Left in Doctor Zhivago. The \"extraor­ dinary\" measures of the late tsarist police prepared the way for the \"extraordinary commission\" of the early Soviet era. By the time the Okhrana acquired its own special headqua rters on the fifth floor of the police building at 16 Fontanka Quai in St. Peters­ burg in I 8g8, Russia had a professional counterrevolutionary organi­ zation with careful files based both on agents' reports and the system­ atic reading of mail in its \"black cabinet.\" A typical file entry on a revolutionary recorded all his known human relationships on radial lines leading out to different circles : red for terrorist links, green for political friends, yellow for relatives, and brown for people known to deal with his revolution ary contacts .l32 Another set of cards used dif­ ferent colors to distinguish among revolutionary (and potentially revo­ lution ary) affiliation s: red for S.R.'s, blue for S.D.'s, yellow for student organization s, white for professional associations, green for anarch ists. There were between two and three million of these cards on file by Igii. The number of documents received by the police passed Ioo,ooo in Igoo and continued to increase.l33 Reports of external spies (filery from fileurs) were collated with those of internal spies ( s o trudniki) ; and prepar ations were laid for mass arr ests at the times of greatest revolutionary activity (and thus of maximum visibility ).134 The coun terrevolutionary police in many ways became a mirror im­ age of the revolution aries. They adopted klichki (pseudonyms ) of their own including the distinction between \"elders\" and \"the young\" which the revolutionaries of the 18gos used; they enlisted their own mam­ ochki and nianki (mothers and aunts, like those of the revolutionaries to host and keep watch respec tively over the \"safe houses\" where secret meetings were held and messages exchanged ); and they classified their agents according to the type of revolutionary each was dealing with : terrorist agents, propagandist agents, and typographist agents. A special importance was attached to the last in recogn ition of the central role that secret presses played as a rallying point for underground revolution aries : .. . to uncover a secret printing press-that was the dream of every \"blue uniform\" from the youngest recruit to the greyest general ... \" liqui ­ dation with typography\"-this was the present that opened the way to cele­ bration, promotion, decoration- 1 35 The coun terrevolutionary empire of the Okhrana metasta sized through­ out Russia like an uncon trollable malignancy. In distant Vladivostok, a Kievan student who had been repelled by the revolutionary demonstra­ tions during Lent assumed a leading role in the two leading journals so that the Okhrana could control them. 1 3 6 In Finland, at the other extrem­ ity of the empire, Leonid Men'shchikov moved in rapidly with a staff of two hundred to promote and enforce the Russific ation of that proud and independent people. 1 37 The peculiar unevenness of Russian political develop ment aided the counter revolutionary Okhrana just as it did the revolutionary parties."},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"The Path to Power: Lenin 47 3 The lack of broad particip ation in the politic al process deprived regu­ lar governmental procedures of any broad sense of legitimacy to resist attacks from either Right or Left. At the same time, the relatively vigorous development of legal procedures made it difficult to gain con­ victions in court. Thus the Okhrana was under mounting pressure to use clandestine methods and, if possible, to gain confessions from the accused to assure conviction . In this way the Okhrana became ever more deeply intermeshed with the life of the Left in order to establish the intimacy needed to induce information and seduce confession. But seduct ion worked both ways. It proved difficult to involve oneself with the Left without entering into its ideals and aspirati ons. There developed, therefo re, in the late-imperial period, a twilight world of uncertain allegiances and identiti es. However much the Okhrana and the revolutionaries opposed one another in principle, they shared in practice a common subculture of intrig ue, anonymity, and excitement. They were the dynamic forces in a static society; and it was easier to change sides than to leave this alluring world altogether. Without the collaboration of Okhrana officials like Michael Bakai from Warsaw and later Leonid Men'shchikov, Vladimir Burtsev could never have formed in Paris his remarkable revolutionary police and detect ive bu­ reau to combat the Okhrana abroad by adopting its own tactics of sur­ veillance and penetr ation , 1 3 8 The most important forms of Right-Left symbiosis were those of the two most famous Okhrana leaders to penetrate the revolutionary move­ ment : Serge Zubatov and Yevno Azev. These were the central figures in the efforts of the Okhrana to undermine what they perceived as the two most serious threats to the regime: Social Democra tic programs to organize the working class and the Socialist Revolutionary revival of political terrorism. If these two famous provocateurs from the Right did not succeed in destroying either movement on the Left, they did in many ways lock the extremes into new kinds of interdepende nce. Zubatov had been involved with revolutionaries as a student, and began working for the Okhrana after his arrest in the mid-188os. Work­ ing as a police sotrudnik, he helped liquidate the last press of the People's Will in Tula in 1887, recruiting in turn Men'shch ikov from among those arrest ed.l39 As Social Democrat ic agitation among urban workers incre ased during the 18gos, many tsarist officials concluded that passive waiting for a second round of violence was an inadequate response. Zubatov felt that the mona rchy itself should take the lead in organizing the workers. He prepared a memorandum in I 8g8 on the workers' question, and in 1901 journeyed to Kharkov to study worker organizations. In May, he organized for the Moscow Okhr ana a new workin g-class organization to rival that of the Social Democrats : the Moscow Mutual Aid Society of Workers in Mechanical Trades.

If Zubatov's proteges staged a pro-tsarist dem­ onstration on February 19, 1902, to commemorate the emancip ation of the serfs and defuse revolutionary mass movements, they also sum­ moned in November the first legal grievance meeting of Russia n work­ ers in St. Petersburg in the Vyborg tractor plant. More Social Demo­ crats became involv ed- especially those with authentic prolet arian roots like I. Babushkin, a veteran of the Union of Struggle in St. Petersburg. Even Lenin, who vehemently denounced the movement, was willing to use it for his own purposes of gathering information and disseminating propaganda. l 4 1 Thus Zubatov's expressly pro-monarchist organizations unwittingly provided vehicles for fresh revolutionary ag­ itation and recruitmen t-rather as the Masonic lodges had for earlier revolution aries. Indeed, Zubatov was dismissed shortly after the gen­ eral strike in Odessa in July 1903 because of official fears that his or­ ganizations were doing more to advance the revolutionary cause than to impede it. The real benefit to the Left of this initiative on the Right came in the Revolution of 1905. The revolution was, in the first place, launched by the dramatic massa cre on \"Bloody Sunda y\" ( January 9, 1905 ) of dem­ onstrators led by an organiz ation spun off from the Zubatov movement. Father Gapon, the priest and former sheep tender who headed the dem­ onstration, had previously known Zubatov and later entered into formal relations with the Okhrana. The Assembly of Factory and Mill Workers which he founded early in 1904 was built up with the knowledge and support of the police in Petersbu rg; but by March 1904 it had developed its own program for social and political reform which was kept secret from the authoritie s.l42 Thus Gapon's organization was able to take the lead in the demonstra tion of January when 15o,ooo of the city's 17 5,000 industrial workers mounted a nonviolent strike and drew up a petition to Nicholas II for modest economic concessions as well as an e nd to \"government by bureaucr acy.\" 1 4 3 Mounted troops fired at the several processions moving from outlying industrial regions in to the center of St. Petersburg. When the main procession led by Gapon arrived singing hymns in the open square before the Winter Palace, hoping to deliver their petition to the tsar, they were fired on and brutally dispersed. Gapon, who was in full ec­ clesiastical regalia, was protected by the Socialist Revolution ary P. Ru­ tenberg, who threw him to the ground and aided his escape-o nly to help hang him in March 1906, after he returned to Russia and ap­ peared to be establishing links with the police .144 \"Bloody Sunday\" precipitated nearly two months of sympathy strikes in some 122 cities and numerous mines and railway lines throughout the empi re.145 Another wave of strikes rose after May Day, which fell on a Sunday, and militancy was intensified by the rising counterrevo­ lutionary violence of the chauvinistic \"Black Hundr eds.\" The defeat of. the Russia n fleet by the Japanese in the Tsushim a S trai t s on M a y 14 and the mutiny of the Battleship Potemkin on the Black Sea a month"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"The Path to Power: Lenin 475 later shattered the illusions of Russian imperial power. The ensuing unrest was more violent and more concentrated in the heart of Great Russia than before. Spin-off elements from the Zubatov movement again appear to have played a more substantial role than is generally recognized in the two most important revolutionary innovations that fol­ lowed : the first \"Soviet of Workers\" and the great general strike of October rgos. Ivanovo-Voz nesensk, the textile center where Nechaev had been raised two hundred miles northe ast of Moscow, launched on May 12 the longest strike of the year involving some fifty thousand workers. 14 6 The first Soviet or \"workers' council\" arose when the rsr-man strike committee (which included 25 women ) assumed para-political func­ tions following the flight from the city of frightened government offi­ cials and factory owners. The Soviet formed its own militi a, assumed powers of local price regulation, and convened a daily open meeting on a small grassy peninsula on the Talka River which was referred to as \"the cape of Good Hope.\" 147 This \"free university on the Talka \" was disrupted by Cossack troops and the Black Hundreds, but continued until July 19. In adopting the name \"Soviet\" and in such incidental demands as a request for a national holiday on February 19, the textile workers in Ivanovo-Voznesensk may well have been influenced by precedents among the Moscow textile workers whom Zubat ov had largely orga­ nized. Zubatov's leading organizer in Moscow had declared himself al­ ready in 1902 to be president of the \"Soviet of Workers of the City of Moscow\" ; 148 and the plans for Zubatov's organizations elsewhere had included elections to other \"Soviets of Worke rs.\" 1 49 The example of Ivanovo soon inspired the Moscow workers to establish their own Soviet, but economic demands in the petitions drawn up by veterans of Zub­ atov's organiz ation continued to domin ate the agenda in Moscow until the great general strike of October. 1 \" o Some Moscow veterans of the moderate Zubatov petition campa ign of early 1905 were radicalized and joined with the Bolsheviks ,15 1 who attached significance to the revival in Ivanovo of the slogan \"workers of the world, unite,\" and ended their own tribute with the words, \"Long live socialism !\" 1 52 Meanwhi le, the most formidable of all So­ viet organiz ations was formed in that bastion of radical politic s, the Technological Institute in St. Petersburg, where Menshevik influence was strongest among Social Democrats and where Trotsky arrived with a galvanizing theoretical presence in mid-October just as the great general strike was beginnin g.153 The Great October Strike presented the world with its first clear demonstrat ion of the revolutionary potential of a nation-wide strike in a modern industrial state. It began almost accidentally with a walkout of printers in Moscow and St. Petersburg. As the strike was taken up by railway workers, the government lost those sinews of transporta­ tion and communic ation it needed to control a continent-wide em p ire. Strike activity spread to the armed forces, the national minoritie s; and it was beginning to arouse the peasa ntry when the frightened autoc-"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"T HE RISE OF THE S OC IAL REVOLUT IONARIES racy issued its manifesto of October 17, promising civil liberties and a consultative national assembly, the Dum a. But public disorder did not subside. After the leaders of the St. Peters­ burg Soviet were arrested on December 3, �ts Moscow counterpart started a new general strike four days later-with Lenin's belated and misplaced encouragemen t. The strike soon became an armed uprising in Moscow, \"the only case during the revolution in which tsarism faced a substantial opponent on the field of battle. \" 1 54 Its bloody suppression and the collapse of the strike on December 19 ended the \"days of free­ dom,\" and pacificat ion of the unrest in the countryside continued during 1906. The uneasy establishment of the Duma system under a reluctant tsar gave way to pure reaction when the opposition-dominated Second Duma was shut in June 1907 and the electoral laws revised. The succes sion of war and revolution in 1904-06 markedly increased the level of violence within the Russian Empire . In outlying regions like the mountainous Caucasus, there were 1, I so acts of terrorism between 1905 and Igo8. 1 55 Traditions of local brigandage merged with Russian revolutionary traditions, and non-Russian insurgents often identified with the Social Democratic party rather than with the more rural and Russia n-dominated Socialist Revolution aries. Among those serving a revolutionary apprenticeship in the Georgian underground was the young Joseph Stalin, who served as a mysterious liaison offi­ cer between the Caucasian bureau of the Bolshevik wing of the party and its fighting squads. Here , as elsewhere, his ability to survive in­ ternecine feuds and 'repeatedly to elude the police or escape from prison strongly suggests that Stalin himself probably collaborated to some degree with the Okhrana in his early years _1 5 6 The only collective Okhrana arrest of Bolsheviks before 1914 was that of the Bolshevik members of the Second Duma, 1 57 which drove Lenin's party undergr ound-and into closer contact with underground agents of the Okhrana. Two of Lenin's closest friends and proteges during the period of exile that ensued were sotrudniki of the Okh­ ra na: David Zhitomirsky and Roman Malinovsky. The former was close to Lenin in Paris after 1908, the latter in Cracow after 1912. Despite warnings from Burtsev to Lenin of his connections with the Okhrana, Zhitomirsky continued to enjoy Lenin's comp anionship and apparent confidence as late as 1915. l 5 8 Malinovsky remained so close to Lenin that, even when his complicity with the Okhr ana was revealed after the revolution, he returned to the U.S.S.R. in the apparent confidence that he would be welco me.l\" 9 Lenin refused to acknowledge Malinov­ sky or save him from summary execution. While there is no reason to believe that Lenin himself had links with the Okhran a, 16 0 there is also no doubt that he directly benefited from the Okhrana's campaign to prevent unification of the Social Democratic party. The Okhrana's ar­ rest of the leading Bolshevik champion of reunification with the Men­ sheviks, Alexis Rykov, was useful to Lenin in preparing the way for Malinovsky's elevation in 1912 to the Bolshevik Central Committee as Lenin's key ally in resisting unification. 1 H 1 Miron Chernomazov, who"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"The Path to Power: Lenin 4 77 succeeded Stalin in 1913 as editor of the Bolsheviks' journal, Pravda, was yet another agent of the Okhrana , 1 62 But the larger Socialist Revolutionary party posed a different prob­ lem. As the direct heir to the populist revolution ary traditi on, the S.R.'s had to be combatted frontally. Their hard core \"fighting organization\" had embarked on a campaign of assass inations which represented an immediate threat to the governme nt. The Okhrana gave the organiza­ tion the mock-imperial code name \"Boris,\" 16 3 and began a direct­ and succes sful-frontal war on the new organiz ation . Its founder was a gifted Jewish pharmacist from Kiev, Gregory Ger­ shuni, who sought to subordinate terrorist attacks to a disciplined overall strategy of the S.R. party. 1G 4 As before, terrorism was the work of the youth movement. The campa ign had been launched by a student attempt to kill the minister of educat ion in February 1901 and led to the first organized movement of revolutionary youth in Rostov in 19 02.l\"5 But the material concerns of the workers became more impor­ tant than the students' familiar calls for \"ideological unification\" in the revolutionary struggle. l t; G The Okhrana's greatest coup was the placing of a former revolution­ ary, Yevno Azev, to succeed Gershu ni as head of the Fighting Section of the S.R. party in 1903. Though working for the Okhran a, Azev made no effort to prevent the assas sination of his nominal chief, minister of the interior Plehve, in 1904. He became a member of the S.R. Cent ral Committee the following year, and helped the Okhrana make its two largest mass arrests of the revolutionary era: of almost all delegates to the first S.R. party congress at Imatra in Janu ary 1906 and of the Fighting Section of the party in March in St. Petersburg .l 6 7 Azev was finally exposed by Burtsev and formally denounced late in 1908 and early in 1909. He could never have sustained his impos ture for so long without a measure of sincerity in his profession of revolu­ tionary commit ment ; Azev had, indeed, been Burtsev's only public sup­ porter during the latter's terrorist period in the 189os. l 6 8 Many con­ tinued to believe that the assertion of Azev's police ties was itself a provocation. The destruction of the terrorist wing of the S.R. party did not bring an end to revolutionary violence, because terrorism had moved beyond the control of the S.R. party even before the Revolution of 1905. The incendiary agent of antidiscipline was the destructive anarchism of the bezmotivniki, the \"without motive\" group within the largely Jewish Black Flag movement in Bialystok and of the smaller group called \"Intransigents\" in Odessa. Inspiration from abroad came in the anar­ chist public ation Bread and Freedom, which began to appear in 1903 with Bakunin's dictum on the masthead : \"The Passion for Destruction Is Also a Creative Passion.\" 16 9 The terrorist revival among the intellec­ tuals spread to the count ryside during the Revolution of 1905. Wires were slashed and crops bumed, and the S.R.'s were unable to chan­ nel violence into their desired end of an \"organized expropriation of the land.\" 170 While the S.R.'s substituted \"fighting squads\" for their \"fighting organiz ation ,\" the far more violent Maximalists split off to"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"T HE RrsE OF THE S ociAL REVOLUT IONARIES form their own terrorist squads . The Maximalists killed thirty-two and wounded the son and daughter of Prime Minister Stolypin in August I906. Rebuked by an outraged public and even by the S.R. Central Committee, the assassins replied that \"the real cause of the public's profound grief is that Stolypin himself . . . is still alive.\" 171 Though the pace of terror subsided after I9o6 thanks to the \"Stolypin neck tie\" (the hangman's noose ) and \"Stolypin trains\" (bearing convicted revolu­ tionaries to Siber ia), Stolypin himself was assassinated in the Kiev opera house in I 9 II. Appropr iately, the assass in had been a police agent among the revolutionary anarchists in Kiev. Though he appears to have acted \"without instructions from any revolutionary organiza­ tion or the police,\" 1 7 2 the impulse to assassinate had been inculcated by experience with both. Identification with the dedic ation and heroism of the terrorist tra­ dition was a major factor in assuring the S.R. party a certain continued preeminence as the revolutionary party of Russia. Even after the Bol­ shevik-led October Revolution in I9I7 , the S.R.'s outpolled them by nearly two to one in the elections of November 25 for the Constituent Assembly : the only free, multi-party election b y universal suffrage ever held in Russia, 173 The revival of terrorism in early twentieth-century Russia paralyzed the will even of those who opposed it. More powerful than the realit y of terrorism was the fear of it. There was fear of the unknown : the myste ri­ ous bomb always about to explode in Bely's hallucin atory novel of I9II, Petersbu rg.174 There was fear of some preternatural link between terror and biblical apocalypse in the novel of 1909, The Pale Horse, by Boris Savinkov, the S.R. leader in the assassinat ions of Plehve in I904 and of the Grand Duke Sergius the following year. Even the original theorist of Russian terrorism, Nicholas Morozov, began blending revolutionary ideas with apocalyptical speculat ion in his Revelation in Thunder and Storm: The Birth of Apocalypse of I907.1 7 \" The final image was that of Christ-as­ revolutionary, leading armed \"apostles\" into windswept St. Petersburg in Alexander Blok's great poem of January I9I8: \"The Twelve.\" Labor violence grew steadily after the mass acre of workers in the Lena gold fields in I9I I, but was soon diverted into the organized violence of World War I. That war was the one indispens able prerequi­ site for revolution in Russia, and it began with an event that blended perfectly the Halo-Polish and the Russian traditions of violenc e. The assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo on July I9I4 was a classical anti-Hapsburg gesture of the kind that the Serbs had taken over from the neighboring Italians. At the same time it was a political assass ination more reminiscent of their supporters in Russia. Popular enthusiasm in Russia for going to war was produced in large measure by crypto-revolutionary sympat hy for the South Slavs . The disastrous war ended for Russia in a revolution and civil war in which the final, rival purveyors of violence were both Polish revolutionari es: Pilsudski and Dzerzhinsky.

A veteran of the conspiracy that claimed the life of Lenin's brother in the 188os and of \"fight­ ing squads\" that conducted spectacular raids against banks and arse­ nals in Russia and Poland during the Revolution of 1905, Pilsudski now returned with an army as the avenging embodiment of a Poland finally freed from Russian domination . Pilsudski was an apocalyptical hero for the new Right in Russia, which had lived in symbiotic intimacy with the old Left in the pre­ revolutionary emigrati on. The novelist Dmitry Merezhkovsky wrote a book in 1921 hailing Pilsudski as the man of God sent to deliver Russia from the Bolshevik Antichr ist. 1 76 In the emigration again after 1917 (as after 1905), Merezhkovsky revived many of the occult ideas from which the revolution ary tradition had originally sprung-such as the Illuminist concept of radiating world-wide influence through concen­ tric three-man circles. 1 7 7 Merezhkovsky drifted uneasily on to Musso­ lini and later to Hitler in search of some kind of new force to free the world from bureaucratic atheism and permit a \"religious revolution\" to unfold. Thus, the romantic revolution ary mentality of Merezhkovsky and some of his S.R. friends like Savinkov helped fortify Pilsudski's pas­ sionate belief that only a nationalist theocracy of the Right could pre­ vent a universal atheist autocracy on the Left. The leading defender of the new atheistic autocracy in Russia was another Pole, Felix Dzerzhin sky. He was the ultimate social revolu­ tionary just as Pilsudski was the distillation of revolution ary nation­ alism. Whereas Pilsudski was a product of the nationalist Polish So­ cialist party in the 189os, Dzerzhinsky had been an early adherent in the mid-1 89os of the first Marxist party in the Russian Empire : the So­ cial Democra tic party of Poland and Lithuania. Dzerzhinsky founded his Extraordinary Commission ( Cheka) for the defense of the revolution just a few weeks after the seizure of power and rapidly turned it into the most awesome political police empire the world had ever seen. He soon formed a Trust to penetrate emigre organizations abro ad, and succeeded in luring back to Russia figures like Savinkov, who publicly renounced his anti-Soviet views before mysteriously dying in a Soviet prison . 1 7 8 Dzerzhinsky began to attach \"special sections\" to Soviet mis­ sions abroad- almost as if his organization were a continu ation of rather than a reaction to the Okhrana. Dzerzhinsky had in fact been educated in tsarist prisons and Siberian exile, where he spent about half of his adult life prior to 1917. A well­ born and devout Catholic who used to force his brothers and sisters to pray regularly, he exchanged his Christian catechism for a Marxist one during his first year at the University of Vilnius and left to become an agitator among workers in nearby Kovno. He learned almost every­ thing he knew from the tsarist police who pursued him and incarcer­ ated him six time s. Among the revolutionary extremists with whom he was impriso ned, the old Russian tradition of self-immolation had been revived in the late imperial period. 1 79 Dzerzhinsky described so­ cialism as a \"torch\" rather than a doctrine; 1s o and himself as a fighter who must be either \"entirely in the fire\" or \"carried to the cemetery.\" 1s1"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"T HE RISE oF THE S ociAL REVOLUTIONARIEs When he was finally borne to his resting place in the Kremlin wall near Lenin, he was hailed by Stalin as having \"burned himself out for the proletar iat.\" 18 2 Radek spoke of him as the great \"disinfector\" of the revo­ lution ; 1 83 and each periodic, ritual purge on which the police empire came to depend was known as a \"cleansing\" ( chistka). All of these metaphors suggest that Dzerzhinsky represented a kind of purified essence of the revolution ary faith. Whereas Lenin had de­ scribed his profession as \"journal ist,\" Dzerzhinsky answered a similar questionnaire with \"revolution ary-that's all.\" 18 4 Here at last was the radical simplificat ion that revolutionaries had so long sought : faith tested by flame. Dzerzhinsky represented the dedi­ cation that power could not corrupt. He was simplicity incarnate, the self-effacing defender of the revoluti on, working sixteen hours a day in a simple building that once housed an insurance company. Far more than Robespier re, Dzerzhinsky deserved the title \"incorrupti ble.\" Two weeks after Lenin's death, he became chairman of the Supreme Council of the National Economy as well as head of police. The fatal blending of these two functions had begun ; and his police empire was turned after his death two years later into Stalin's personal instrument of political and economic terror . The weapon Dzerzhinsky had created to defend a simple faith was used against those who continued to make things complic ated. Soviet intelligence destroyed the Russian in­ tellig entsia. If the sword was wielded by Stalin, Dzerzhinsky had forged it. Dzerzhinsky, in his last years, was, perhaps appropriately, Stalin's most important ally in leadership battles with Trotsky and other rivals for the mantle of Lenin. The reign of the secret police under Stalin far surpassed anything remotely imagined by the Okhran a.l 8 5 Though Stalin's successors dis­ mantled most of the concentration camps, the \"extraordin ary\" power of the police remained. A biographical film glorified Dzerzhinsky in the early Brezhnev era under a title Veliky Podvig (the \"great deed\" ) traditionally used to describe the heroic and saving work of saints. Ne arly a quarter of a century after the gigantic likenesses of Stalin had fallen from public places throughout the Soviet Empire, Dzerzhin­ sky's massive, forty-foot statue still loomed in front of the secret police headq uarters he first established in the Lubianka near the Kremlin . For all their use of provocateurs, the tsarist Okhrana never engaged in the counterassassin ations abroad that the Soviet secret police were to attempt. Indeed, the growing concern for due process at trials and relatively humane treatment in prison and exile made the Okhrana's camp aign against the revolution aries far less severe and effective than that of its Soviet successors. There were only four mass arrests by the Okhrana in the early twentieth century, 18 6 and Lenin like many others enjoyed relati vely good conditions for reading and writing during his far-fr om-arduous exile in Siberia.

The Leninist regime preached in its passionate early days a violently antination alist repudiat ion of the war effort to which the Provisional Government of Kerensky had recommitted Russia.

Their revolution in power went beyond the symbiosis of the old extremes to build a brave new world that procl aimed totalita rian peace as the only sure alternative to total war. There were three fundamental \"problems of Leninism\" that his myr­ iad followers have been left to deal with. These questions go beyond the basic, general problems of Marxism : whether or not there is only one answer to all questions, and whether or not secula r society is perfectible. Leninism poses the added problems of (I) an ethical double standa rd: contr ary yet equally binding moral obligations to participate fully in mass movements yet to render absolute allegiance to an inner elite; ( 2) an antidemocrat ic bias which may have been caused by the condi­ tions of pre-revolutionary Russia, but continues to be defended as uni­ versally valid ; and finally, ( 3) the absence of any but the most naive plans for just administration after a succes sful revoluti on.

Lenin's social revolution was doomed to confinement in one coun try after the final defeat of the attempt at revolution in Germany in Janu ary 1919 . Women were central to both the original victory in St. Petersburg and the final defeat in Berlin. Women had only slowly gained prom­ inence within the revolution ary traditi on; but they had assumed spe­ cial importance within the German and especially the Russian move­ ment. The March Revolution in St. Petersburg was triggered by a mass demonstr ation for International Women's Day. The Janu ary upheaval in Berlin was ended by the murder of the only revolutionary person ality of the era to rival Lenin in stature : Rosa Luxemburg. As in Brussels in August 1830, so in St. Petersburg in March 1917 a festive popular event had unintended broader consequences. Just as an operatic performance had triggered a national revolution in 1830, so an essentially apolitical women's demonstr ation started the chain of events that led to social revolution in 1917. There is a kind of inner logic in both cases. Romantic operatic melodrama was, as we have seen, a symbol of and stimulus to the visceral cause of national revoluti on. The women's cause, on the other hand, was equally linked to the more rationalistic, rival tradition of social revolution. For a final reprise on the story of revolutionaries without power, it might thus be appropriate to turn to the role of women, a largely powerless social group in nineteenth-century .Europe.

Women became particular ly involved in revolutionary events during the aftermath of World War I, producing in Rosa Luxemburg perhaps the most authentically prophetic revolu tion­ ary of the early twentieth century. This discussion of the involvement of women in the revolu tionary traditions can only scratch the surface of a complex problem. Neces­ sarily excluded from our consistent focus on ideological innovators and leaders are the great bulk of rank-and-file revolutionaries who hap­ pened to be female, and of feminists who were more or less revolu­ tionary. At almost any given point throughout the period under con­ siderati on, some women simply shared and echoed the political and economic demands being advanced by men. Others sought to change only the social role of women, who were still confined to fixed and subor dinate roles in the patriarchal European family system. The former group more or less passively accepted the agenda set by male revolution­ aries; the latter group only occasionally and episodically identified with the largely male revolution ary movement. Our discuss ion will focus on a third category : innov ative feminine revolutionar ies, prophetic women who were both original and impor­ tant within the revolution ary movement. Such women often brought to the broader movement a special aura of moral super iority , born in part out of their very exclusion from power. Their criticism of Euro­ pean society tended to be especially far-reachin g, to point towards a social revolution beyond local perspect ives. On occasion, they went even beyond the social dimension altogether to suggest new sexual, cultural, and psychological dimensions for revolutionary thought. Be­ cause these are subjects of renewed interest at present and of uncer­ tain significance for the future, this final retrospective look at revolu­ tionary origins will focus on women. The French As with so much else, the history of women revolutionaries begins in the turmoil of the French Revolution. Thinkers in the Enlightenment had concentrated largely on the limited question of how educ ation would improve the lot of women. 1 The otherwise proto-revolu tionary Rousseau was the first in a long line of convinced antifeminists within the French Left. Women played few leading roles in the American Revolution or in the initial stages of the French. A small group of revolution ary feminists soon appe ared in France, however.

Mary Wollstone­ craft rebuked Burke for rejecting the French Revolution, wrote a Vin­ dication of the Rights of Women, and journeyed excitedly to republican Paris in I792. As the wife of the libertarian anarchist William Godwin and mother of the wife of the romantic atheist poet Shelley, she was a kind of matriarch of the female revolutionary tradition despite her lack of influence in her native England or in Scandin avia, to which she repaired after leaving revolution ary France.3 Bonne ville's Social Circle was almost alone in seeking radical equal­ ity for women, largely through its remarkable feminist spokesperson, the Dutch Baroness Etta Palm d'Aelder s.4 The only thinker to link a radical social vision with revolutionary ideas about the role of women (a nd specul ation about the polymorphous possibilities of sexual ex­ perienc e) was, as we have seen, a man: the inventor of the word Com­ munism, Restif de la Bretonne. The dominant spirit of the French revolutionary era was that of Les Revolutions de Paris, advising women to stay home and \"knit trousers for our brave sans-cullotes.\" 5 \"Politically, women at the close of the Revolution were worse off than at the beginning\" ; 6 and, in the settle­ ment of ISIS, women gained no new rights except of inheritance and divorc e-with the latter soon revoked by Louis XVIII. The temper and legacy of the Napoleo nic era was aggressively mas­ culine. There had been a kind of struggle within France between the feminine world of the salons and the mascu line world of the grande armee. Napoleon's most tenacious internal foes had been wom en: first the ideologues gathered around the last of the salon mother figure s, Mme. Helveti us; and then the liberal romantics gathered around Mme. de Stael.7 The revolutionaries of the Restor ation era in continental Europe were exclusively masculi ne: small bands of junior officers from the N apo­ leonic wars and male students who banded together in Maso nic-type fra­ ternal organization s. Buonarroti, the pioneer of social revoluti on, broke with this exclusively male recruitment pattern of the early national revolutionaries. In exile in Switzerland during the early Restoration, he sought to work through acqua intances who had taken temporary teaching jobs in girls' schools to recruit women for his trans-national revolution ary organization . He \"always found among women greater disinter estedness, devot ion and constancy than among men.\" 8 His principal aid claimed to have \"created among young ladies a real army of republican blue stockings\" B in Switzerland. But Buon arroti's inner revolutionary organization seems never to have admitted women-ap­ parently because of two problems that he identified : the congenital insolence of men (who treat them as \"pieces of domestic furnitur e\") and the inability of women to get along with each other under stress. 10 Prati added his own more venal complaint that women in radical meet ings were so unattractive as to cause \"the most ardent lover of womankind to make an eternal vow of celibacy.\" 1 1 In England feminism proved a reformist rather than a revolutionary"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"The Role of Women cause. The movement for women's suffrage had begun as early as 1818-Ig. The original version of the People's Charter called for univer­ sal adult suffrage, which was only later revised to manhood suffrage.l 2 English feminism , like Ame rican, moved in the bourgeois mainstream in pursuit of the vote and rarely attached itself to socialism as an ideology or to the proletariat as a class. 1 3 In France, however , a truly revolution ary feminism became a majo r force between the revolutions of 1830 and 1848. The realm of politics and power was still a man's world, but the advent of women into jour­ nalism brought more ranging moral concerns about society as a whole and a new strain of pacifis tic internation alism . Women helped extend horizons beyond the often narrow political perspectives of earlier all­ male conspiracies to broader visions of a transformed humanity. The ever-ingenious Saint-Simonians led the way by proclaiming that the coming social revolution would be led by a feminine messiah. Dis­ illusioned with the purely political Revolution of I 830 and with their own failure to establish a new society in Paris under \"Father Enfantin\" in 1832 (\"the year of the fathe r\"), a large group of Saint-Simonians proclaimed 1833 \"the year of the mother,\" named themselves les com­ pagnons de la Femme, 1 4 and set off to the East in search of a fema le saviour. Their leader, Barraul t, proclaimed himself the \"Saint Peter of the Feminine Messiah\" and saw favorable omens in volcanic eruptions, the appearance of Halley's Comet , and the death of Napoleon II (pre­ sumably the last possible male messiah ). Barrault addressed an appeal To jewish Women, hailing them for rejecting the idea of a male mes­ siah and producing instead the \"bankers of kings\" and \"the industrial and political link among peoples.\" Against his belief that the Jews might produce the new feminine messiah, another Saint-Simonian argued that India produced more sensuous goddesses and a more truly \"an­ drogynous God\" than Jewish \"male authorit arianism.\" 1 5 There was a kernel of deep seriousness in all of this. The idea that androgyny (the state of Adam before the fall) was the only truly lib­ erated human condition had, since Boehme, been a central concept within the occult tradition. The romantic preoccupation with overcom­ ing \"alienation\" led some beyond the social dimension into ques tions about the basic , biological alienation of one sex from another. An­ drogyny appeared both as the goal of humanity and the key to immor­ tality in Enfanti n's last work, La Vie Eternelle of 1861. 16 Fourier believed that social renovation required the harmonizing of 12 basic passions and 810 \"principal characters\" created by their inter­ play. Even many who did not entertain his kind of fantasies were in­ trigued by his concept of total liberation and of gratifying the passions in gourmet phalansterie s. Emancipation of women from their limite d, familial roles was a particularly pleasing aspect of his system ; and the term \"feminism\" was apparently introduced by FourierJ 7 The Saint-Simonians argued that a man and woman together (le couple pretre) should replace the individual as the basic unit of society to insure both equality between the sexes and sociab ility within so-"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"T HE RIS E oF THE S oc iAL REvoLU TIONARIES ciety. 1 8 Building a new type of family was for them a prerequisite for renovating society. With the failure both of the political Revolu­ tion of 1830 and of their own mass propaganda camp aign of 1831, the radical Saint-Simonians thought that women no less than workers might provide new messages of liberation. Among the feminine con­ verts for creat ing a new \"family\" was an orphaned proleta rian girl, Suzanne Voilquin, who joined (together with her husband, sister, and broth er-in-l aw) the journal of women workers, La Femme Libre. Because the title lent itself to ridicule, she soon changed it to La Femme de l'Avenir and then La Femme Nouvelle, ou Tribune Libre des Femmes. But these journals failed, as did the journey East in search of a feminine messia h.l9 This voyage to the East may seem in retrospect either a comic fantasy or a pathetic reprise on Napoleon I's expedition to Egypt. It did, nev er­ thele ss, direct Saint-Simonians to the land that eventu ally built a monu­ ment to their belief in reshaping the water routes of the world : the Suez Canal. Moreover, their adventures did lead to a feminine messiah of sorts. For en route to the East, Barrault met and converted to the new Saint-Simonian doctrine a then-obscure twenty-five-year-old second mate on the ship, Giuseppe Garibaldi. 20 He was destined to become not only one of the most succes sful revolution aries of the century-but one of the most deeply dependent on a woman. In 1839, after many more ocean voyages and several years of revolu­ tionary freebooting in Uruguay and Brazil, Garibaldi suddenly lost his Italian comrades in a shipwreck and drifted desol ately off the coast of Brazil. According to his own testimony, he resolved to find a woman as his only hope, spied through his ship's telescope a magnificently ath­ letic creole, went ashore to tell her \"you must be mine,\" and brought her back on board. 21 Whatever the exact truth of the story, there is no doubt that Anita, his \"Brazilian Amazon,\" saved him from ruin. Through­ out the next decade she was inseparably at his side even during long horseback rides and hard fighting, until she died in 1849 outside Rome amidst the collapse of the revolut ionary republic they had briefly estab­ lished there. The newly active women of France in the early nineteenth century were neither revolutionaries nor messiahs : no longer dames but not yet citoyennes . If men had celebrated their revolutionary opposition to the aristocracy sartorially by becoming sans-culottes, some women now also began to defy bourgeois convention by assuming male dress. 22 Journals for women slowly moved from fashion and gossip to social satire and reform . Saint-Simonian feminists disrupted a speech by Robert Owen in Paris in 1837 in a manner foreshadowing later internal protests within the Left against \"male chauvin ism.\" The young woman who denounced the absence of women from Owen's podium was challenging the identifica­ tion of radical social reform with the arid rationalism and exclusively masculine organization of Owen's principal host, Cesar More au, founder of the Societe de Statistique Universelle and editor of L'Univers M aQonnique. 2 3"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"The Role of Women The most important new aspect of social ferment attributable largely to women was a passion for pacifism and nonviol ence. Delphine Gay and George Sand collaborated in a camp aign for the abolition \"of all violent penalties, and the suppression of wars\" in the moderate Christian Journal des Femmes, which began appearing in 1832. Eugenie Niboyet, the editor of several journals for women and a leading fem­ inist in Paris, founded in Lyon the first pacifist periodical: La Paix des Deux Mondes.24 The entrance of women into revolutionary activity was directly re­ lated to the emergence of a social revolution ary tradition as a rival to nationalism. However color ful the example of Anita Garibaldi, women played almost no role in the Halo-Polish national revolutionary move­ ments. Of the 5,472 Polish emigres registered in France in I839, almost all were revolutionary nationalists and less than two hundred were women. 2 5 The most remarkable new prophet of pacifism and anti­ nationalism in the pr e-1848 period was another Latin American who came closer than Anita Garibaldi to filling t he role of a female messiah : Flora Tristan y Moscozo. The daughter of a Peruvian aristocrat al­ legedly descended from Montezuma and the future grandmother of Gauguin, Tristan was the first to conceive of a truly denationalized class solidarity among the proletar iat. 2 6 At the conclusion of the physical and spiritual wander ings amply re­ cited in her Peregrinations of a Pariah, Tristan joined together in the 184os the causes of women and workers, the two \"pariahs\" of the mod­ ern world. 2 7 After leaving her husband, who had nearly murdered her, and reverting to her maiden name , Tristan went to London. Horrified by its poverty and inhumanity, she called it \"the monster city\" (La Ville Monstre). 2 B She went everywhere, from the House of Lords (whose all­ male premises she entered disguised as a Turk ) 2 9 to the famous luna­ tic asylum of Bedlam, on a visit to which she appe ars to have acquired her sense of a messianic calling. so Tristan toured France seeking adherents for her projected Union Ouvriere, gained the collaborat ion of George Sand, and corresponded with German journalists about her idea of a \"universal union\" of work­ ers.3 1 She associated the term proletariat not only with the economic categ ory of propertyless workers, but also with the moral mission of saving humanity from all its divisi ons-i ncluding those between the sexes. The hero of her truly fantast ic socialist novel, Mephis or the Proletarian, was a rich banker who simultaneously comes under the spell of a feminine messiah and declares himself a proleta rian.3 2 Tristan remained florid in fantasy till her death early in I 844. She contended that Christ's second coming would be far more cheer ful than his first, since he would no longer be single but accompa nied by a femme-guide .33 She also argued that the three persons of the Trinity should in the coming socialist age be represented as Father, Mother, and Embryo .34 Her last book was written together with lhe occultist Abbe Consta nt, as she immersed herself in a bizarre subculture of mystical feminists"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"T HE R ISE OF THE S OCIAL R EVOLUT IONARIES under the influence of his The Assumption of the Woman .35 The most fantastic were the \"fusio nists,\" who procl aimed the Feast of the As­ sumption in the year I 838 as the \"first day of the year Evadah,\" in which a new androgynous species (recombining Eve with Adam, as the name indic ates) would begin transforming the Earth.

In Amer ica, the cause of women's rights was also often linked with that of Negro rights and of nonviol ence.4 2 Oberlin College, which pioneered the admission of blacks on an equal basis with white s, also became in 1841 the first to graduate women. The two causes were blended together in a rema rkable American contempor ary and counter­ part of Flora Tristan : Frances Wright. She was the rarest of all phe­ nome na: a dedicated revolutionary in a prosperous, post-revolu tionary society. The daug hter of a wealthy Scott ish merchant, Frances (Fanny ) Wright published in London in 1821, Views of Society and Manners in America, which inspired revolutionaries throughout Europe during the Restora­ tion era and led to an intim ate, lifelong contact with the sixty-seven­ yea r-old Marquis de Lafayette. On their first meeting, he paid tribute to her writings about the American Revolution : You have made me live those days over again ....

She accompanied him to America in September 1824, remained with him throughout most of his long, trium phal tour, and returned to France for five years of re­ newed associa tion in the revolution ary summer of 1830. A handsome woman nearly six feet tall, Fanny Wright often ap­ peared in white, toga-like attire. She gave her friends names from antiquity (Jeremy Bentham was \"Socrate s\"), and became herself a kind of classica l goddess for many young revolutiona ries. She acted as com­ panion and consoler to the Irish martyr Wolfe Tone in New York, the Italian General Pepe in London, and an unidentified lover known only in her correspondence by the revolutionary pseudonym of Eugene.4 6 In the second half of the 182os, Fanny Wright attempted to put into effect a grandiose plan to free the American slaves by integrating blacks into a new type of egalitarian communi ty: new plantations that would be converted into productive Owenite settlements. Working closely with the son of Robert Owen (and attempt ing to enlist the widow of Shelley ), she set up a pilot multi-racial community first in Nashoba, Tennessee, and then in the main Owenite settlement of New Harmo ny, Indiana. On July 4, 1828, she became the first woman in the New World to deliver the main address in a large public celebration of this national holiday.47 She became an ardent Jacksonian and moved to Philadelphia amidst the gathering labor turmoil which saw the establishment of the first la­ bor paper in history, the Mechanics' Free Press, in 1828. In New York City she founded a radical propaganda society, the Free Enquire rs, that celebrated Thomas Paine's birthday as its major event and established branches in other cities, partly on the Carbonari model.48 Still pre ­ occupied with the racial question, she set off to Haiti with a group of blacks and a radical French printer and educat or, Guillaume Sylvain Casimir Phiquepal D'Arusmont, whom she married in 1831 after be­ coming pregna nt. In 1830, first elated, then soon disillusioned by the July Revoluti on in France, she concluded that only in America could the final, unive rsal revolution be realized. She saw it as atheistic , egalitarian, and anarchis­ tic. In the final seventeen years of her life after her return to Amer ica in 1835, she bought the Cincinnati home of the anarchist Josiah Warren , and championed \"the ridden people of the earth\" against \"the 'booted and spurred' riders.\" She became increasingly apocalyptical as the radical tide receded in post-Jacksonian America. On the eve of I 84 8, she predicted that America was on the verge of a new \"fourth age\" of humanity. Christianity, \"the religion of kings\" had given way to feudalism, which was replaced in America first by \"the Banking and Funding System\" and now by a totally secular religion of the people.49 A radical concept ion of the role of women was central to her revolu­ tionary teachi ng.

The milestones in women's emancipation in the Anglo-American world had passed her by: the beginning of the women's suffrage move­ ment at the Anti-Slavery Convention in London of June 1840, and the first convention on women's rights summoned by the Society of Friends in western New York in the summer of 1848.5 1 It was in Europ e, not America or Great Britain, that feminism became linked with revoluti on.5 2 Fanny Wright had first been attracted to the revolution ary cause by reading a history of the American Revolution written by an Italian, who had projected onto the American experience his own hopes for Italian national liberati on.53 The grande dame of radical feminism in New England, Margaret Fuller of Brook Farm, be­ came a true revolutionary only in Italy, where she was swept into the Revolution of 1848 after visiting France and George Sand in 1847.5.J The European upheaval of 1848-49 produced a host of new feminist journals, many with revolutionary positions. The first women's daily in France, La Voix des Femmes, appeared in March 1848 as a \"socialist and political journal\"; and was followed by La Femme Libre, La Republique des Femmes (which published La Marseillaise des Femmes in its first issue ) ,55 and La Politique des Femmes (a journal of working­ class women which soon changed its name to L'Opinion des Femmes). A remarkable group of young women demonstrated under the banner Vesuviennes in March, issued a Manifeste des Vesuviennes in April , and proceeded to set up an egalitarian female commune in Belleville, where the original Communist Banquet had been held. 56 But women's liberation was still far away. Ribald journals ridiculed women's demands,57 and most revolutionaries remained patronizingly indifferent to the '1ady Vesuvi uses.\" Delphine Gay complained that the cry \"long live the provisional governme nt!\" was equated with \"long live the provisional ladies !\" 58 Women played a leading role throughout the 1840s in glorifying the art forms of ordinary workers and peasants, proclaiming that, in the present era, \"the creative role in poetry belongs to the proletariat, to the people.\" 59 This literary populism which swept through Europe in the 184os owes its deepest debt to the most influential woman of her age , one of the few who dared wear men's clothes and adopt a man's name, George Sand. Almost singlehandedly she turned the serialized novel into seductive socialist propaga nda. Beg inning with her Spiridon of 1838, written under the influence of Lamennais, she flooded France with a new kind of fiction, which challenged both the historical novel of Stendahl and the realistic novel of Balzac. She purported to depict"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"The Role of Women 49 1 man not as he was or is, but \"as I wish he were, as I believe he shall be \"; 60 and she fired the revolutionary imagination of the 184os by identifying this ideal with peasant and proletarian in a romantic, almost sensuous manner. But Sand faded away as a revolutionary voice after the failures of 1848. The Second Empire of Napoleon III proved even more aggressively masculine in spirit than the First Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte. Women played a major role in the Paris Commune. The forces of the Right, which attacked with special vehemence in their propaganda les petroleus es, the \"women incendia ries\" who allegedly set fire to Paris, arraigned more than one thousand women in the repression that fol­ lowed. G1 A first sign that Russian women were to take away the leader­ ship role of revolutionary womanhood from the French may be detected in the dominant role assumed by Russia n emigrees in the two princi­ pal women's organizations in the Commune, the Union of Women and the Montmartre Women's Vigil ance Committee .6 2 One final female leader of the French revolutiona ry tradition arose from the martyrdom of the Paris Commune : Louise Mich el. She reas­ serted with new intensity the characteristic Sand-Tristan themes of in­ ternationalism and pacifism. Variously known as la Vierge rouge, la sainte laique, and la fiamme revolutionnaire, G3 she was as inflamma­ tory in speech as she was demure in appearance. Perennially dressed in black with a high white collar, she defended herself eloquently at the trial of communards, endured prison in New Caledonia, and returned to become the uncompromising apostle of the anarcho-syndicalist dream of la grande greve. 64 Michel was one of those leaders who belonged to no party \"but to the Revolution as a whole.\" 65 By the turn of the century she was perhaps the most passionate and outspoken foe of militarism in Europe. Denied a visa by the United States and expelled from Belgium, the very s ugges tion that she might venture abroad anywhere unleashed a flood of protests and appeals to the Quai d'Ors ay.66 She spoke eloquently on questions that revolutionaries usually avoided. After nearly dying early in 1904, she outlined a revolu tionar y attitude towards death before a large audience in Paris. She lent beauty to revolutionary atheism, describing death as a mere \"incorporation into the elements,\" a radiation outward from the body of aromas and color s, a return to the simplicity that she remembered in New Caledonia after a typhoon. The complexities of human language would simply dis­ appear; and a simple song \"composed by a nihilist\" would fill the air and enable one to descend into \"the hole of shadows . . . beating back with one's arms the walls of an abyss.\" 67 As if to parody the purity of such faith, the various revolutionary fac­ tions in France quarreled bitterly over the right to dispose of her body when she died in Marseilles on January g, 1905. Anarchists vied for her remains with Rochefort, the former revolutionary journalist who had supported her financially even after his turn to reactionary national ism. Her funera l was the largest popular procession in France since the:"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"4 9 2 T HE R rsE OF THE S oc rAL R EVOLUTIONARIES burial of Victor Hugo twenty years earlier.us As her body was lowered into the grave, the cry rang out, \"Long live the Russian revoluti on! Long live anarchy !\" 6 9 On the very day of her burial, the Russian Revolution of 1905 had broken out. It was a revol ution she had predicted just be­ fore her death, 7 0 and was led by a movement in which women played a more central role than they ever had in France. The Russians The example of George Sand helped implant within Russia the revolu­ tionary consciousness that prepared the way for 1905 and 1917 . The two greatest writers who participated in the pioneering socialist cir­ cles of the 184os in Russia, Dostoevsky and Saltykov, both considered Sand a leading force in activating their social consciousness and one of the supreme personalities of the century. 71 Had she lived beyond her premature death in 1842, Elena Hahn, a novelist and early advocate of women's rights , might have been the Russian George Sand.7 2 Had Konarski's revolution ary network in western Russia not been destroyed in 1839, the organizer of its special women's circles, Ewa Felin ska, might have become the Russian Flora Tristan.73 Had the Russia of Nicholas I not turned repressive in its later years, it might have im­ bibed the revolutionary feminism of Suzanne Voilquin and other Saint­ Simonians who moved from Egypt to Russia in the late 183os, bringing with them the vague idea that Nefertiti and Cleopatra provided models for the new feminism .74 Most influential of all in the 184os was Herzen's novel in imitation of George Sand about an illegitimate Rus­ sian girl in which the cause of female liberation was linked to that of liberating the serfs .75 Under the more liberal rule of Alexander II, the role of women and the women's quest ion became centrally important to the Russian revolu­ tionary tradition. The young seized on the issue of women's rights in part because of the unusua lly subordinate position historically as­ signed to women in Muscovite society. Here also was an issue that di­ rectly, emotionally affected university students themselves newly re­ leased from the social and doctrinal rigidities of a semin ary-b ased sec­ ondary school and anxious to break with the matriarchal dominance and patriarchal discipline of the traditional Russian family. The greatly increased university popul ation of the early I 86os sought a new com­ munal ethic and life-style that would provide both social justice and sexual satisfaction.

From his first three published articles as a boy of seventeen in I86o to his lauda tory preface of I86g to John Stuart Mill's Rights of Women, Mikhailovsky devoted much of his energies to the cause of women.79 Woman's Herald, printed in St. Petersburg dur­ ing I86o-68, the last and most radical feminist journal of the r86os, attracted contributions from influential writers like Lavrov and the novelist Gleb Uspensky, who were to domin ate the populist era. Russia in I 86g-7o followed England by just a few months in pioneer­ ing the admission of women to advanced study in its majo r universi­ ties.H0 Female students proceeded to play a majo r role in the intensified radical agitat ion of the early seventies. In Zurich, the major center of Russian study abroad, I03 of the 153 students at the university were women. 8 1 So central to the budding revolutionary movement were the new women's groups (from the women's club for logical speech to the Fritschi group, named for their baffled Swiss landlady ) 8 2 that the alarmed Russian government in December I873, ordered all women students to return from Zurich by the end of the year. The male mi­ nority demonstrated their solida rity with the women by returning also; and the women reciprocated by participating in both the movement to the people of I874 and the subsequent turn to terrori sm. Almost every dramatic moment of the I87os produced the heroic example of a young woman. Vera Zasulich, a typesetter in St. Petersbur g, opened the camp aign of political terror by shooting the police chief of St. Petersburg in Janu ary I878. When she gained acquitta l by her court­ room oratory, she provided a successful model for turning the criminal trial of a would-be assassin into the political trial of the intended victim. The final plans for the successful assass ination of Tsar Alexander II on March I, r88I, were supervised by a frail twenty-six-ye ar-old blonde, Sophia Perovs kaya. Another female conspirator, Gesy a Helfman, provided the major human interest of the trial (and gained the only re­ prieve from the gallows ) when it became known that she was pregnant.

In the atmosphere of reaction under the new Tsar Alexander III, yet another woman named Faith (Russian Vera) kept alive the revolu­ tionary faith. Vera Figner played the leading role within Russia in pre­ serving for much of the decade a vestige of the old People's Will orga­ nization, her memoirs providing one of the best human chronicles of the movemen t.84 Maria Oshanina, the third woman veteran (along with Perovskaya and Figner) of the executive committee of the People's Will, was a leading Jacobin centralizer and major transmitter of conspira­ torial ideas to the new revolutionary movements of the 189os.85 Though often mistresses to the young revolutionar ies, women were also often mother figure s. Alexandra Weber, for instance, provided ma­ ternal care and comp anionship success ively to each of the two rival leaders in the revolutiona ry emigration of the 187os: nursing Bakunin in his last years, then serving as the intimate confidante of Lavrov .8 6 Inside Russia, the illegal press of the original Land and Liberty organi­ zation, which defied police detection for four years in the early 186os, was housed in the fiat of an elderly woman nicknamed \"Mother of God.\" Revolutionaries recalled entering her premises \"with the sense of awe experienced by the faithful crossing the threshold of a temp le.\" 87 Such images were not simply a figure of speech ; the revolutionary tradition was influenced here by Russian secta rian religion, often cen­ tered on a female leader known as a \"Mother of God.\" Land and Liberty published a special journal for religious dissenters and gave itself the coded design ation Akulina, from a female saint whose name was used both by a famous secta rian prophetess and by the flagellant sect that went to the extreme of self-castration. s s Women tended to be more revolution ary than feminist in Russia. They unhesitatingly used femininity for revolutionary purposes- arranging a fictitious marriage to provide conspirator ial cover, hiding a revolver in a muff, stuffing a detonator in a corset. 89 The distinctive role of women in the Russian movement was to pu­ rify and intensi fy terror, not to articulate ideas.ao Thus women took the lead in susta ining the terrorist tradition after the destruction of the People's Will organiza tion (about half of the sentences to life at ha rd labor in the 188os were imposed on women ) 91 and in reviving that tradition in the early twentieth century.

Every­ thing the women had done \"was again analyzed from the point of view of its purity.\" 9 G This passion for purity fueled a growing desire among women revolution aries to be the one to throw the bomb,97 to be sen­ tenced to death,9B or even to immolate one's self in prison. As if revert­ ing to the self-burning tradition of the Old Believers (where women, too, had played a leading role) ,99 women terrorists in the populist-S .R. tradition used this awesome tactic to express the sincerity of their faith : Sofia Ginsburg in 18go, Maria Vetrova in 1897, and Sofia Khren­ kova, a vill age teacher and mother of three, in Igo8. 1° 0 Fire was moving from the minds of men to the bodies of women. Their bodies like their faith were usually pure. Both forms of purity were sealed by the heroic act of martyrdom , which lent to the words of women an authority that they could not otherwise easily command in Russian society. Terrorist women were generally selective, restrained, and even self­ sacrificial in their use of violence. Evstoliia Rogozinnik ova, a twenty­ one-year-old scholar ship student at the St. Petersburg Cons ervatory of Music, apparently used her be autiful figure -hea vily perfumed in an elegant black dress-to gain entry into the main prison administration in St. Petersburg, where she shot the director. She was forcibly pre­ vented from carrying out her original intention of blowing up the entire building by detonating the thirteen pounds of high explosives that she had packed into her bodice and used to enhance her bust. 101 As she was executed three days later in St. Petersburg, new Joans-of­ Arc began to appear in the provi nces, lending compelling moral author­ ity to the belief in social revolution during this darkest period of re­ action .

The cofounder of the German party, August Bebel, produced his theo­ retical work, Woman and Socialism, in 1879, five years before Engels's less influential and more theoretica l Origin of the Family.1°9 The German movement received an injection of Russian intensity when its leading woman, Clara Zetkin, visited St. Petersburg as revo­ lutionary unrest was mounting in 1878, became fascinated by the Rus­ sian example, and married a Russian. After the repeal of Bism arck's antisocialist laws of 1878- 90, she founded a special paper for socia list women, Equality (Die Gleichheit ), which became an international jour­ nal after she cofounded an Intern ation al Socialist Women's Congress in 1907. Women were, however, underrepresented in the German party leade rship ; and at times Zetkin and the Austrian leader Adelheid Popp were the only women leaders to be found in the large German-speaking deleg ations to the congresses of the Second Internation al. Zetkin's par­ allel \"Women's International\" collapsed after a final, desperate Women's Conference against World War I in 1915 at Bern .1 1 0 As a friend of Lenin, a Communist, and the oldest member of the Reichs tag, Zetkin presided over the penultimate meeting of the last freely elected Ger­ man parliament before Hitler. 1 11 Meanwhile, Zetkin's movement had found fulfillment in Russia. Within a year of her Socialist Women's Congres s, the Russians had assembled one thousand women for the First All Russia n Congress of Women in 1908.!12 When Zetkin designated March 8 International Women's Day in 1910, the Russians celebrated it with special intensity. The annual demonstra tion led to repression in 1914 and prevented the launching of the special journal, RabotnitsG; (The Woman Worker) planned by Lenin's wife Krup skaia, his sister Anna Elizarov a, and his closest female friend, Inessa Armand.

She added to Russian and German involvements the passion of her native Polish revolutiona ry tradition and the prophetic intensity of her Jewish ancestry. She opposed both elitist Bolshevism and reformist Socia l De ­ mocracy. Luxemburg presented for a brief moment at the end of World War I the vision of a revolution big enough to unite Germans and Russia ns, to resolve the Polish, Jewish, and women's question all at once. With her death in 1919, the vision faded of a revolution that would be uncompromisingly both international and democratic. Born to a Jewish merchant family in Russian Poland, Luxemburg was impressed as a fifteen-yea r-old girl with the working-class agitation in Warsaw that began in the winter of 1885, well before comparable unrest in St. Petersburg. She was briefly connected with the major organiza­ tions of revolution ary socialists within Poland, \"Proletariat\" and \"Sec­ ond Proletariat,\" before fleeing to Zurich in 1888. 11 6 In that emigre center of Russian and Polish Marxists, she met her lifelong revolution­ ary comp anion and future husband, Leo Jogiches (Tyszka), shortly after he too fled abroad in 18go. He had been a revolutiona ry leader in Vil­ nius, where Jewish women had played key roles in beginning Social Democratic organizations within the Russia n Empire .ll 7 He briefly es ­ tablished contact with Plekhanov's Liberation of Labor gr oup, then trans­ ferred allegiance along with Luxemburg to the Social Democratic party of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania. Beginning in 1893, she par­ ticipated in every congress of the Second International except the final one in 1913, and was in every sense of the word an international figure. Luxemburg began her lifelong struggle against national parochialism by rejecting the cause of Polish independe nce, which had been es­ poused by the larger Polish Socialist party (PPS) founded in 1892. She argued instead for total Polish involvement in the destruction of tsar­ ism. Her struggle in Poland for a Marxist proleta rian party against the populis t, peasant-based PPS paralleled the conflict between Marxists and populists in Russia.

Like Lenin, she combined an uncompromising revolutionary faith with great tactical flexibility based on subtle ideological distinction s. She argued that prior to a revolution socialists could and should serve in parlia­ ments that make laws, but never in an executive branch which en­ forces them. l20 She relied more than Lenin on institutions spontan­ eously generated by the proletariat, and made the most sustained effort of any leading Marxist to adapt the new Latin ideal of a general strike into a skeptical German Social Democracy. She invented the term \"mass strike,\" not as a \"crafty device discov­ ered by subtle reasoning,\" but as a descr iption of what the complacent Germans might learn from the Russian revolutiona ry experience of 190 5 . l 2 1 For Luxemburg, the mass strike was a new form of prole­ tarian class struggle that had superseded the bourgeois barricades of 1848-49 and even 1870-71. The mass strike was a sponta neously gen­ erated phenomenon that was not called into being, and could not be manipulated on its course by any self-proclaimed elite.l 22 The mass strike unified the political ( antiabsolutis t) and economic ( anticapital­ ist) struggle s, and progre ssed necessa rily from the demonstrative to the fighting stage. After initial demonstrations had overcome inertia and stimulated political conscio usness, fighting would begin sponta­ neously and usually accidentally. Out of the shared experience of com­ bat, new forms of proleta rian politics and culture would emerge. In Luxemburg's view, the Russian Revolution of 190 5 failed because the economic struggle, which had led to nationwide political struggle during the October general strike, relapsed back thereafter into paro­ chial economic conflic ts. But since this was the first revolution in which the proletariat had assumed the leading role, she urged the German Social Democrats to regard it \"as their own\" and to learn from it. Above all, the Russian example showed the \"bureaucratised\" Germans how a less organized movement can leapfrog over a less active one­ and how organization can grow out of struggle rather than the other way around.1 23 Her emphasis on the \"spontaneous\" leadership of the masses in the revolutionary process put her at odds with Lenin. She had been one of the first to criticize Lenin's emphasis on the vanguard role of the party as represent ing \"ultra-centralism,\" \"the sterile spirit of the night watchman,\" dictatorship over the masses rather than of the masses. l 2 4 She saw Lenin as guilty of the same \"subject ivism\" and \"Blanquism\" that had haunted Russian populi sm; and she consistently rejected Le­ nin's willin gness to allot a progressive role to national revolutionary movements in the coming social revolution. In her unfinished study of the Bolshevik Revolution (written while in prison in Breslau /Wroclaw ) Luxemburg insisted that democratic forms be applied immediately un­ der the dictatorship of the proletariat. She censured the reliance on"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"The Role of Women 499 terror and the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly by the Bolshe­ viks, translating the word democracy into \"people's hegemony\" (Volks­ herrschaft) in an effort to find a vocabul ary adequate for her idea , 12 5 Her criticism of terror in 1918 was ultimately the same as her original criticism of party elitism in 1903 : that it leads to an atrophy of initiative and a growth of the very bureaucratic rule that revolutions should supplant. l26 Parallel criticism of Lenin's elitism was given a special aura of disin terested purity by the most revered revolut ionary woman within Russia, Vera Zasulich, who had moved from populism to Marxism ,12 7 Despite their deep differences and criticisms of each other, Luxem­ burg resembled Lenin in leading a Left oppos ition within a prewar Social Democratic party, in developing a global vision that provided o utward courage and inner serenity, in linking capitalism to imperial­ ism and war, and in seeing national war as inevitably leading to social revolution . During the period of reaction between the ebbing of the revolution­ ary tide in Russia in 1906 and the outbreak of World War I, both Lenin and Luxemburg sought to fortify the ideological fervor of their respec­ tive parties with major new theoretical writings. Luxemburg sought to use not merely journalism, but also the party school at Berlin as a vehicle for attacking the more cautious and doctrinaire wing of the party and for radicalizing future party leaders . This technique was adopted first by the \"left Bolsheviks\" under Bogdanov at Capri ( 1909) and Bologna (November 1910 through March 19II) and then by Lenin at Longjumeau outside Paris in the summer of 1911. 1 28 Luxemburg also preceded Lenin in making a Marxist analysis of imperi alism , and she paralleled Lenin in her radical boycott of World War I. Her famed \"Junius broch ure,\" written in prison in 1915, rejected the key argu­ ment used by the German Social Democrats to rationalize their support of the war effort : that it was a defensive war against the Russia n p eril. 12 9 She insisted that no isolated defensive war was possible for major p owers in the age of imperialism. The Russian proletariat, she said, was now at the forefront of revolution, and not merely part of the react ionary monolith that it had seemed to Marx at the time of the 1848 revolution and to most German Social Democrats ever since. In the war, Luxemburg saw new possibilities for revoluti on. When she was released from prison and arrived in Berlin on November 10, 1918, the day before the final armisti ce, she plunged into a delirium of ac­ tivity designed to realize a social revolution in Germany. Her ill-fated attempt at revolution played back in reprise many of the basic themes and symbols of the revolutionary traditi on. Even her choice of revolutionary pseud onyms betrayed an unconscious harken­ ing back to origin s. From Junius (originally used by the Strasbourgeois Jewish revolutionary Frey in Paris during the great French Revolution ), she moved to the Gracchus of Babeuf, on to the Spartacus adopted by the original German progenitor of revolution ism, Adam Weishau p t.

She also planned on a theoretical weekly to bear a title describing its scope , Die Internat ionale. Hers was a revolution of the young. At the founding conference of her new Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (Spartakusbu nd) late in December, her husband was the only delegate (out of 127 from 56 lo­ calities) over the age of fifty.l3 2 Hers was a movement led by jour­ nalistic intell ectuals. One of its few victories was the occupa tion of the Wolff telegraphic bureau in Berlin-the heart of the same commun i­ cations system that had so fascinated Marx when he first came in contact with its extremity in Brussels. Luxemburg was too penetrating an analyst of society not to realize that there was no hope for immediate revoluti on; and she argued against the illusions of her principal corevolutionary Karl Liebk necht. Since, however, she was committed to a mass-based general strike and to a revolutionary struggle against the national assembly, she saw no alternative but to join the disorg anized struggle that ensued in Jan­ uary. Her Spartacists combatted armed forces that were returning from the front and attempting to establish the authority of the national assembly and of the more conservative Social Democrats. A general strike attracted mass particip ation, and led to a brief seizure of centers of transportat ion and communication. But Luxemburg lacked both Le­ nin's organizat ion and his ability to translate strategic vision into con­ crete battle plans. The revolutionary Spartacists and their allies were soon shot down and Luxemburg was killed together with Liebknecht on the night of January 15. Hitler's National Socia lism was to be the final gargoyle of mascu line revolutionary national ism. Luxemburg's uncompromising socia list in­ ternationalism was its polar opposite : the culmination of the antina­ tionalist, antimilitarist tradition among women revolutionar ies. Her implacable opposi tion to any participation in World War I had been echoed in Russia by the leading radical feminist Alexandra Kollontai, who joined Lenin's Bolshevik party in 1915 largely because of his op­ position to the war. Like Luxemburg and Zasulich, Kollontai identified revolution with the sponta neity of workin g-class initiative rather than the elite Leninist party.

Indeed, she brought back some­ thing of the expressive humanism of the earlier Halo-Polish period into the arid puritanism of the Social Democratic tradition, which both Lenin and his barren coworker and wife, Krupskaia, epitomized. Luxemburg had expressed the special, universal criticism of society that women of unusua l ability and sensit ivity like Wright and Tristan had voiced before. She breathed inspiration into the grim Social Dem­ ocratic movement often through a network of other wom en: Louise Kautsky, with whom she remained an intimate friend even after break­ ing with Kautsky in 1910; 1 35 Clara Zetkin , the early foe of revisionism and intimate correspondent of her last years; and Sophie Liebk necht, to whom she addressed inspiring letters from prison in her last years. She was never a feminist, sharing unasha medly in the distinctively feminine experiences of being a comp anion and cook. 1 36 But she brought to the revolutiona ry movement a warmth of engagement with­ out self-indulgence that was generally foreign to male revolution aries in the nineteenth century-let alone to the dull functionaries of the twentieth. Rosa Luxemburg stood in a prophetic line of revolutiona ry women who renounced both home and count ry in search of the promised land. The list stretches from Etta Palm, a Dutch woman in Paris; through Flora Tristan, a Peruvian in Ly on; to Saint-Simonians in Egypt; to Fran­ ces Wright, the Scottish wife of a Frenchman on the American frontier; to Russians in Switzerla nd, on to this Polish-Jewish leader who sought to replicate the Russian Revolution in Germany. Rosa Luxemburg was not just a prophet of revoluti on-of its failure in Germany 1 37 and its deformation in Russia-but an embodiment of revolution ary simplicity. Beyond all the words written by this most articulate of all revolutionary journalists, 1 3 8 lay a simple faith beyond reason-in transn ation al, proleta rian perfectibil ity; in violent struggle as a creative process and prerequisite to victory; and in those original myths of the revolutiona ry tradition : in an unfinished revolution and a perfect natural order. The essential vision that she affirmed in her life and validated by her death is perhaps best conta ined in her description of the simple per­ fection she once found on primitive Corsic a. Islands had provided the perennial locus of utopia, from the imagination of Thomas More to the reality of Sand on Majorca or Garibaldi on Caprera. Luxemburg described Corsica, where Buonarroti and Urbain had found inspiration, as an ideal alternative \"to the Europe of today,\" a place to satisfy that deep desire of revolutionaries to oprostit'sia: to simplify things. Writing from prison to Sophie Liebknecht, Luxemburg recalled recov ering \"the silence"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"5 02 T HE R ISE OF THE S OC IAL R EVOLUTIONARIES of the beginning of the world\" amidst the rustic purity, and finding the archetypical unspoiled \"people\" in a poor peasant family that passed silently by \"precisely in harmony with the landscape.\" She felt inspired \"to fall on my knees as I always feel compelled to do before some spectacle of finished beauty.\" 1 3 9 She proposed to Liebknecht that the two women journey together to Corsica for a kind of pilgrimage of renewal, reviving the original metaphor of the revolution as rising sun : We must go there and . .. cover the whole island on foot, sleeping each night in a new lodging place, greeting each morning along the way the ris­ ing of the sun. l4o But Luxemburg went instead from prison to a martyr's death with Liebknecht's husband. She reaffirmed her faith in the ultimate victory of revolution in her last written words, which returned to the older, messia nic meta phors of her Judaic heritage : The revolution will \"raise itself up again, clashing,\" and .. . proclaim to the sound of trum pets : I was, I am, I shall be .1 4 1 Such a passionate life and dramatic death left behind not just a legend but a kind of haunting presenc e. When social revolutionaries finally came to power in Germany, not spontaneously after World War I but via the Russian army after World War II, the Stalinist regime in East Germany tried in vain to represent itself as the vindic ation of her hopes. l 42 She had written shortly before her death that true vic­ tory lay \"not at the beginning but at the end of revoluti on.\" 1 43 The suspicion grew that that victor y-and her revolution-was perhaps still to come. Some have seen posthumous vindication of her vision in the revived invocation of her name during the late 196os and the early 1970s: by French and Italian student radica ls, by female German terrorists, or by admirers of new anti-imperialist movements in the third world and the cultural revolution in Mao's China. 1 41 But Luxemburg was a Euro­ centric believer in the spontaneous leadership of the modern industrial proleta riat. She may have found her most authentic reincarnation within the proletariat in her native Poland. Only there had her memory been deeply and continuously honored within a Soviet-dominated Com­ munist party. In December 1970, the Polish working classes sponta­ neously rose in a mass strike against bureaucratic despotism unguided by any external political or intellectual elites in a move that surprised both East and West. The strike produced in Poland the first forcible change of political leadership by direct proletarian action in Europe since 1917. The unexpected overthrow of Gomulka seemed a poetic vindication of Rosa Luxemburg. The strike began in Szczecin on the border area between the Polish and German worlds where she had spent much of her life. It brought down a man who had just succeeded in expelling almost the last of Luxemburg's fellow Jews from that region in which they had historically suffered so much.

To them, she can speak of forgotten dreams- reminding them that a Jewish woman once argued that Poles should unite with Russians for their common good ; that Germans would benefit from revolution in Russia; and that social revolution would directly abolish both the national identities and the autho ritarian controls that repress the creativity of working people themsel ves."},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"Epilogue: Beyond Europe THIS HISTORY has dealt with revolut ionaries who functioned inside Europe and without power during the period from the late eighteenth to the early twentieth centuri es. There is no room here to discuss the legacy of their ideas to those who have subsequently exercised massive state power in the name of revolution . The very different world since 191 7-of total war and totalitarian peace, of Stalin's early identifica­ tion of revolution with power and of Mao's final search for a revolution beyond power-all of this would require another volume with its own special techniques of analysis and texture of description. A brief epilogue can perhaps suggest only one key feature in the movement from the nineteenth to the twentieth century : the spread of the revolutionary political faith from Europe to the awakening East. By the early twentieth century, revolutionary nation alism much like that of Europe in the early nineteenth century was spreading through the Mro-Asian world in a kind of global chain reaction against the \"new imperialism\" of the great European powers . The primary place of combustion for this nationalist revival was the political no-man's land that stretched out beyond the Danube to the banks of the Tigris and the Nile. This was the East nearest the West, the Middle or Near East, the locus of the Eastern Quest ion. This original cradle of Western civilization became the breeding grounds for the new age of anti-Western revolution s. If the Francocent ric era of revolu­ tionary activity had as its main enemy the Hapsburg Empire and the Germano-Russian era focused on the Romanov Empire, the epoch of world revolution began with revolt against the Ottoman Empire . The upsurge of violent revolutionary nationalism began with an un­ justly neglected echo of earlier European movements : the Internal Macedonian Revolu tionary Organization. Started as an anti-Ottoman organizat ion in 1893, it began its never-successf ul efforts to produce a Macedonian nation with the slogan \"Better an end with horrors than hor­ rors without end.\" Excessively romant icized in their own time as heroic"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"so6 Epilogue: Beyond Europe mounta in rebels fighting the cruel Turks, 1 the IMRO deserves a fresh look by a later generation as perhaps the first mode rn national liber­ ation movement : using underground broadcasting, urban terror, and a strategy consciously designed to bring international opinion to bear on a local political situation. The \"broadcast ing\" occurred on Elijah's Day, July 20, 1903, when gramophones hidden behind icons in Macedonian Orthodox churches suddenly burst out with the prepared message : \"Brother ! The hour has come to begin the struggle .... Down with Turkey and with tyranny. Hurrah !\" 2 The urban base for the movement was the cosmopolitan port city of Salonika, where a group of high school students first known as Rab­ blerousers and then as the Crew studied the Russian revol utionary movement and drew up ambitious terrorist plans of their own. Seeking to combat economic as well as political tyranny -and to attract inter­ national attention in the proce ss-this group spent better than two years digging an enormous tunnel under both the Constant inople and Salonika branches of the Ottoman Bank. The plan was to blow up simul­ taneously both buildin gs, while unleashing a series of coordinated ex­ plosions throughout the city of Salonika. The explosions began on the morning of April 28, 1903, on board a French ship unloading muni­ tions for the Turkish army; and by the end of the day, other explosions had plunged the city into smoky darkness and unleashed a reign of fierce reprisal by Turkish troops. IMRO thus made a crude and ultimately suicidal attempt at instant revolution. Apart from the hopeless odds against the Turks, the rebels in the cities were not coordinated with the IMRO leaders in the country­ side , whose uprising during the summer of 1903 lasted only a little longer and never gave much reality to their self-proclaimed \"govern­ ment of the woods.\" Neverthele ss, its attempts to plan, discipli ne, and concentrate resources on focused surprise attacks were prophetic of the guerrilla warfare of the future. IMRO took refuge in the technique of sudden attack and then total disappe arance back into the countryside , and it became almost impossible to stamp the movement out alto­ gether. \"When a Turkish division thinks that it has located a body of troop s,\" a colonel observed, \"it suddenly discovers that what it has found is only a group of peasants busy tilling the soil.\" 3 After the revolution of the Young Turks in 1908, IMRO revived, and continued to rally its coun trymen to the perpetually frustrated cause until crushed in 1934 by the very Bulga rian army that had once provided training for many of its original cadres. IMRO was the least successful of Balkan revol utionary movements in building a nation, but the most successful in terms of longevity in exercising power and waging combat. From within five years of its first organiz ation in 1893, the pyramidal organization, whose basic cell was a group of ten men, exercised effective power over much of Macedonia, denying crops, taxes, and safe residence to the occupying powers.

Terrorism moved into alliance with mass national liberation struggles in the colonized, rural Balkans; and similar movements soon devel­ oped in the Asian parts of the Ottoman Empire -and beyond. The Russian Revolution of 1905 opened a new, global \"era of revo­ lutions,\" produci ng-l iterally -an electric effect. The generator of the revolut ion was in many ways the St. Petersburg Technological Institute, which summoned the first student rally on the day after the first mas­ sacre of demonstrators before the Winter Palace (on \"bloody Sunday,\" January 9, 1905); 4 survived a military siege of its student buildi ng; 5 and convened the first Soviet of workers in its lecture hall. Krzhizhan­ ovsky, the electrical specialist and Bolshevik activist in St. Petersburg during 1905, saw the electric transmitter as representing \"the trans ition from the anarchy of capitalist production to production by plan.\" 6 He later helped Lenin redefine communism in terms of the two things that were literally introduced to Russia within the walls of his alma mater, the Technological Instit ute: \"Soviet power plus electrificati on.\" 7 Electric wire service permitted the events of an unfolding revolution to be reported in 1905-for the first time in history -on a day-to-day basis throughout the world. The effect was particularly great outside of Europe, where the new imperialism had infected new regions with Western revolutionary ideas. The proud and ancient civilizations of Asia were particularly sensitive to the expanding power of the Euro­ pean states. The unprecedented news that an Asian nation (Japan ) had defeated a European imperial power (Russia) in the war of 1904-5 encouraged new leaders to mobilize the revolutionary potential of the \"external proletariat\" in the less developed but densely populated East. Internal revolution in Russia following wartime defeat by an external Asian power produced immediate Eastern echoes : both on minorit y groups within the Romanov Empire and in the Asian states just across its borders. Unrest moved first across the turbulent Caucasus to Iran, where in December 1905 a general strike broke out in Teheran even as the gen­ eral strike was collapsing in Moscow. In Tabr iz, by September 1906, the first of several Persian workers' councils (Soviets) fashioned on the Russian revolutionary model was established. Full suppression of the Persian revolutionary movement was assured only with the Anglo­ Russian joint intervention of 1911. 8 In that year, the first modern revolution in China overthrew the Manchu dynasty. Its leader Sun-Yat Sen was also influenced by the Russian Revolut ion of 1905 and the tradition that lay behind it. He had met with Russian revolutionary leaders like Gershuni in Tokyo, where he set up a Russian-type student­ based revolutionary movement in 1905 built around a journal simila r to Herzen's Bell.9 The Russian example also influenced the turn toward strikes and insurrection of Young India,lO and the revolution of the Young Turks which overthrew a corrupt sultan in 1908. The earlier Young Ottoman organization of the 187os had been in-"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"s oB Epilogue: Beyond Europe fluenced by the rise of a Russian revolutiona ry tradition after defeat by Russia in the Russo- Turkish War. Now a Young Turk movement arose based on a secret cell of officers in Salonika. They sanctioned a mixture of strike tactics and armed resistance similar to that of Armenian secret societies under the apparent influence of the Russian revolutionary movement of 1905-6. 11 The rising of Asian revolutiona ries to oppose European empires re­ peated in many ways the rise of European revolution aries against the Hapsburg Empire a centu ry earlier. Mazzini's Young Italy and Young Europe were the direct ancestors of the Young Turks and other young national movements in Asia. As in early nineteenth-cen tury Europ e, Asian national revolutionaries of the early twentieth centu ry included vague ideals of social revolution in their dreams of national liberation. Asian revolutionary nationalism in the early twentieth century fre­ quently followed the patterns of its European prototype. The Chinese revolutionary movement prior to 191 I, for instan ce, was as dependent as the Russian movement had been on the leadership of emigre ideo­ logical journa lists (Sun-Y at Sen in Hawaii and Japan, much of the future Communist leade rship in France ) , 1 2 The same emigre guidance was essential for the Vietn amese Revolution , with Ho Chi-Minh living successively in Paris, Moscow, and Canton. Left-Right interaction is also evident in the Soviet training of the son and successor of Chiang Kai­ shek, head of the Nationalist regime on Taiwan ; and in the strange pattern of transmission of terrorist ideas from Vietnam. Some right­ wing French terrorists (the OAS) appear to have learned their tech­ niques while imprisoned by the left-wing terrorists in Vietnam . The French Right in turn imparted a similar schooling back to the Algerian Left (the FLN ), whose successful terrorist methods pay tribute again to the symbiosis that occurs when les extremes se touchent. If Asian revolutionaries echoed European ideas in the twentieth century, European revolutionaries had occasi onally echoed Asians in the nineteenth. The most sophisticated theorist of nationa l insurrection among the ever-prophetic Poles had moved ever farther afield in his search for inspirational models : from the relatively familiar Spanish and Russian resistance to Napoleon, to the Serbian and Albanian re­ sistance to the Turks, the Algerian to the French, the peoples of the Caucasus to Russia, and finally of Afghanistan to England during the war of 1838-42. As Russian troops streamed into that mountain land in the last days of the 1970s, it seemed eerie to read a Polish exile of the 184os urging close study of the Afghan resistance to an earlier im­ perial invader \"because there it will be possible to uncover the source of the rebuilding of Poland .\" 1 3 As Mrica later followed Asia in its awakenin g, a new theorist of revolutiona ry violence journeyed-like Isma il Urbain a century before -from the West Indies through France to Algeria. Frantz Fanon re­ echoed many of the themes of the original ltalo-Polish apostles of heroic violence a centu ry before. \"Viol ence, alone,\" he insisted, \"makes it possible for the masses to understand social truths \" and is a \"cleans­ ing force\" that \"frees the native from his inferiority complex and from"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"Epilog ue: Beyond Europe 5 0 9 his despair and inaction.\" 14 \"To shoot down a European is to kill two birds with one stone, to destroy an oppressor and the man he opposes at the same time.\" 1 5 But his message was less original than he thought. His style reflected more his Western training as a psychologist than the real thinking of the third world. Only perhaps in Castro's Cuba was there any continued response to Fanon's arousing Africa to revolutionary violence; and that response depended on the power of Cuba's imperial benefactor, the U.S.S .R. Cuban revolutionaries themselves -from Marti's long years as a revolutionary journalist editing The Golden Age in New York in the late nineteenth century 1 6 to Castro's long exile in Mexico and in the maquis-repeated many of the themes of the national rev­ olutionary tradition. When a Cuban national revolution came into con­ flict with the imperial power of the first nation to be born in revolu­ tion, the United States, it attracted considerable sympathy-but more among well-fed young students in the overdeveloped West than among the hungry in the underdeveloped world.

Both his polemic crudeness and his doctrinal hostility to a synchronous approach are in sharp contrast to the most outstanding single Soviet study of the revolutionary process in early modern Europe : B. Porsh­ nev, Frantsiia, Angliiskaia Revo liutsiia i evropeiskaia politika v seredine XVII veka, 1970, which treats all of Europe from 1630 to 1655.

Elliott, \"Revolution and Continuity in Early Modern Europe,\" Past and Present, 1969, Feb, 35-56; and P. Zagorin, \"Prolegomena to the Comparative History of Revolution in Early Modern Europe,\" Comparative Studies in Society and History, 1976, Apr , 15 1-74.

Seleznev, Sotsial'naia revoliutsiia, 1971, useful mainly for its accounts of internal Soviet dis­ cussions of the 196os. 31. An important and neglected \"sociological model of the revolutionary process\" came from the short-lived Czech reform period and includes compa rative graphs of the English, French, and Czech revolutions (the latter defined as 1414-50 ).

Topolski, \"Rewo lucje w dziejach nowozytnych i najnowszych (x vii-xx wiek ),\" Kwartalnik Historyczny, LXXXIII, 1976, 251-67. He distinguishes ( 264-6 ) between six types of revoluti on : pre-capitalist, early bourgeois, bourgeois, bourgeois-democratic, early proletarian, and socialist. 32. These complaints are voiced repeatedly by R. Cobb, for instance, in his review of a good recent history confined to one region (S . Schama, Patriots and Liberators. Revo lution in the Netherlands, 17 80-1 813, NY /L, 1977 ) in Times Literary Supple­ ment, 1977, Jul 29, 906-7. 33· The systematic attempt in this area by E. Wolfenstein (The Revolut ionary Personality: Lenin, Trotsky, Gandhi, Princeton, 1967 ) makes its case more per­ suas ively for Gandhi than for the more traditional revolutionar ies. J. Seigel im­ proves on earlier efforts (such as A. Kiinzli, Karl Marx. Eine Psychographie, Vienna, 1966 ) in extending this method to Marx : \"Marx's Early Developm ent : Vocation, Rebellion and Realism,\" Journal of Interdisciplinary History, 1973, Winter, 475-508 ; and, in the context of his entire career, Marx's Fate.

Sociological and psychological analysis is combined with particular effectiven ess for Rousseau and Robespierre in F. Weinstein and G.

Polemic political usage of the term dates at least from the Dutch Revolution.

The term was widely and diversely used at the time of the American Revolution (see R. Shoemaker, \"'Democracy' and 'Republic' as Understood in Late Eighteenth Century America,\" American Speech, 1960, May, 83 ). James Wilson, an author of the American Constitution, saw it vindicating \"the democratic principle.\" (Cited in ibid., 89 ) . But most identified democracy with chaos in any but small states. They argued rather for republicanism, agreeing with Madison that \"democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention ... and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.\" The Federalist, no. 10; also citations in Shoemaker, 88. 32.

Rude's study of the event from the bottom up refutes the romantic picture of a mass movement, showing that between Boo and goo probably assaulted the Bastille (even though some 250,ooo or more were under arms in Paris), and that few un­ employed or even wage earners were involved. See The Crowd in the French Revo lu­ tion, Oxford, 1959, 56 ff., 180-1; The Crowd in History, NY, 1964, 99 ff., 126, 250. Neither Farge's argument that the events were not a simple response to Desmoulins's leadership, nor Rude's demonstration that the crowd was not simply driven by hunger or direct grievance (as they had been in attacking the custom­ houses) indicates the important mobilizing role played by the clientele of the Palais-Royal. In this respect, as in many others, traditional, semi-legendary ac­ counts, which both of these authors refute in detail, may nevertheless come closer to the truth by providing (as Farge and Rude never do) an overall accounting for the event. 7· Lacroix, Actes, first series, 1894, I, 97-8. 8.

A valuable doctoral dissertation that came to my attention too late for general use in this work (G.

VIII, 1787 : L'Isle inconnue. 173. The literature on utopias has become enormous and increasingl y repet itious in recent years. More introduced the Greek word for \"nowhere,\" Utopia, in his pic­ ture of an imagin ary voyager discovering an ideal society : De optima reipublicae statu, deque nova insula Utopia, Louvain, 1516; and some subsequent Reformation tracts published in Antwerp were listed as coming from Utopia. M. Kronenberg, \"Forged Addresses in Low Country Books in the Period of the Reformation,\" The Library, 1947, Sep-Dec, 81-3. Similar dreams of an ideal order like those of Andreas and Campanella arose in the wake of the religious wars in the early seventeenth century (just as Plato's Republic had appeared after the suffering and division of the Peloponnesian Wars ); but secular utopianism begins with the awakening of the geographical imagination and of social criticism in the literature of the Enlighten­ ment. The earliest secular utopias-like many of the most recent-saw men overcoming sexual as well as social divisions. Gabriel Foigny's Les Aventures de jacques SadeuT, 1676, and Varrasse d'Alais, Histoire des Severambes, 1677, depicted, respectively, a societ y of hermaphrodites and a communal life with eight hours of pleasure a day (Reybaud, Etude, 37-40, 54, 6o). But secular literature soon began to invest real places with the utopian qualities of perfection. The tendency to idealize European experiments (the Jesuit state of Patagonia in Paraguay ) gave way to more radical praise for the unspoiled Indians themselves, beginning with plays like Dialogues or Encounters between a Savage and the Baron de la Houta, 1704. In the course of the eighteenth century, \"heroic\" utopias inspiring men to action increasingly prevailed over \"escapist\" utopias lulling men to quiescence. This progression in J, Szacki, Utopia, Warsaw, 1968, is similar to the one that C. Rihs traces from \"sentimental\" to \"revolutionary\" utopias in Les Philosophes utopistes; le mythe de la cite com­ munautaire en France au XVIIIe siecle, 1970; and to the distinction of E. Bloch between \"uchronias,\" which look back to a heroic past, and \"utopias,\" which are future-oriented sources of militant optimism and secular revolution. See Bloch, Das Prinzip Hoffnung, 1955, II; and Geist der Utopie, Frankfu rt/Main, 1964; also P. Furter, \"Les fonctions de l'utopie,\" L'Imagination creatrice, la violence et le changement social, Cuernavaca, 1968, 3/II-3/41. B. Baczko, \"Lumieres et Utopie. Problemes de Recherches,\" Annales, 1971, Mar-Apr, 355-86, inclines rather to the view that utopian ideas gener ally lead to reformism rather than revolution. L. Sar­ gent, \"Utopia-The Problem of Definition,\" Extrapolation, 1975, May, 137-48, dis­ cusses none of the preceding works and deals mainly with narrower literary and structural problems. For an uneven but often stimulating series of short papers and discussions on social ideas in utopias, see Le discours utopique. Colloque de Cerisy, 1978. Utopian thought helped launch the revolution ary search for \"symbolic geography\" ( Certeau, \"La revolution fondatrice,\" 81 ff. ): for some tangible, secular locus for an alternative society. The disruptive potential of this mode of speculation was in­ creased when combined with the \"polemic, irreligious and socia lly revolutionary\" tendency to juxtapose natural law to Christian tradition.

The still mysterious Morelly's Code de la nature, ou le veritable esprit de ses loix, de tout terns neglige ou mec onnu, appeared in five editions between 1757 and 1773, following on his Naufrage des isles flottantes, au Basiliade, Messina, 1753, which purported to be translated from an Indian work.

Lynch, The Spanish American Revol utions. r8o8-r826, a valuable synthesis that is weak in discussing idea�. The concept of independencia will be treated in a forth­ coming study of German Arcinie gas; and the historical luster of this term probably accounts for the inten sive recent use of its opposite (dependenc ia) by Latin American nationalists to characterize their continued cultural and economic domi­ nance by North America without direct control. The first Declaration of Independence in Europe after the outbreak of revolution in France (that of the nearby Belgian province of Brabant in October 1789 ) re­ peatedly refers to \"the nation\" and \"the body of the nation,\" and insists that \"the will of the nation is always the supreme law.\" Godechot, Pensee, 68, and 67-9. The word \"nation\" entered the vocabulary of American politics in the ideological mod­ ern sense largely after the outbreak of the French Revolution through idiosyncratic ideologists like James Wilson, then associate justice of the Supreme Court who asked rhetorically in Chisholm vs. Georgia in 1793 : \"Do the people of the United States form a NATI ON?\" (G. Dennison, \"The 'Revolution Principle' : Ideology and Cons titutionalism in the Thought of James Wilson,\" Review of Politics, 1977, Apr, 187). The first university course taught on the American Revolution (at Harvard in 1839) used a history written in r8o9 by an Italian nationalist who had become a French revolutionary activist in order to inculcate a full-blown romantic nation­ alism for which there were still no American texts.

Martin, \"Propos autour d'un tableau historiq ue: Rouget de Lisle chantant la Marseillaise,\" Saison d'Alsace, 1964, Winter, 108-II. It had long been argued that the melody could not have been invented so rapidly and must have been taken from some forgotten operatic work of the period-vari­ ously said to be Dalayrac's Sargines ou l'eleve de l'amour, Gretry's La Caravane de Caire, or a lost work of Mehul, to whom Rouget de Lisle dedicated his published collection of 1796. Tiersot carefully refutes these claims and insists that Rouget was the sole author of both words and music : Histoire, 410-22. More recent specu­ lation has focused on possible borrowings by Rouget from an oratorio based on Racine's Esther, composed by the music master at the Cathedral of Saint-Omer, where Rouget was stationed previously. See M. Vogelais, Quellen und Bausteine zu einer Geschichte der Musik und des Theatres in Elsass, Strasbourg, 1911. A. Gas­ toue, \"L'air de la Marseillaise, naqu it-il a Saint-Om er?\" Echanges et Recherches, Roubaix, 1939, Jan 148-53, answers the question with a decisive no, insisting that the composition was original. At the same time, he indicates that Rouget drew some key phrases from local military terminology (\"enfants de la patrie\" and \"aux armes, citoye ns\") and from Sargines ( \"entende z-vous le bruit de guerre . . . Marchons, marchon s\"). See also further references and discussion in J. Mouchon, La Musique en Alsace, Strasbourg, 1970, 136. 26. Harsany, 109-IO and ff.; R.

(A. Bester, Jr., \"The Evolution of the Socialist Vocabulary,\" Journal of the History of Ideas, 1948, Jun, 270-r .) These phalanxes championed peaceful social idealism from the first effort by a Romanian journalist in Bulgaria (F. Manuel, The Prophets of Paris, Cambridge, Mass, 1962, 208-g ) to the enclave of New England intellectuals at Brook Farm. The same term was revived by Fascists a centur y later : From the Falanga of Polish Fascists who later became Stalinists (A. Bromke, \"From 'Falanga' to 'Pax,' \" Survey, 1961, Dec, 29-40 ) to the elite units (falange s) of Franco's successf ul military revolution against the Spanish Republic. But the main continuing thread of usage-and that most faithful to Babeuf­ was that of Filippo Buonarroti, Babeuf's disciple, future biographer, and historic revolutionary in his own right, about whom we shall have a good deal to say later. Buonarroti's followers were to reach as far afield as the Flemish Phala nge fiamande Anneessens of the r83os. (A. Galante Garrone, \"Buonarroti en Belgique et la Propagande Egalita ire,\" in Babeuf et les p r oblem e s du Babouvisme, 1963, esp . 221-5 ; drawing largely on J.

Bakunin in his correspondence of 1870 with Nechaev, argued that the Russian revolutionary students of the 186os were \"a true youth ... without status or homes\" who could uniquely provide the needed \"phalanx\" for \"the people's revolution .\" (Letter of Bakunin to Nechaev of Jun 2, 1870, first published by M. Confino in Cahiers du Monde Russe et Sovietique, 1966, Oct-Dec, 626.) The recurrence of this Babeuvian-Buonarrotian term may be merely fortuitou s; and revolutionary genealogies are notoriously elusive. But there is within Babeuf's original revolutionary \"phalanx\"-part icularly as idea lized retrospec tively by Buonarroti-an interesting foreshadowing of the passion for purity-and for purge-of the modern professional revolutionary. 144. Babeuf, Pages, 249-50. The figure of 2,000 is given by Buonarroti only. For a concise and critical discussion, see D. Thomson, The Babeuf Plot, L, 1947, 21 ff. 145.

Jean Varlet, Projet d'un mandat special et imperatif, aux mandataires du peuple a la convention nationale, 1792, 22, 7, 9, 13, 15. Varlet did not foresee, how­ ever, the need for radical egalitarian measures so much as \"the gradual disappear­ ance of excessive inequality\" once the accounta bility of central legislatures to grass-roots assemblies was secured : 13 and 11-4. The nature and extent of the activities of the Social Circle press can probably never be determined because of the fire that destroyed records in the Palais-Ro yal; but the press survived at least until r8oo, through the journal of 1797-18oo, Le Bien-Informe, edited by Bonne ville and Mercier under the imprimatur of l'im­ primerie-lib rairie du Cercle Social. This journal (BN) compared Napoleon with Cromwell (see biography of Bonneville in Biographie universelle, 1843, V, 38) and represents a continuation of the intimate association that Mercier clearly had with the press (publishing there a host of writings from his Fictions momles of 1792 to his Le Liberateur of 1797 ). 234. Ibid., 71-2. Dalin, the only scholar ever even to consider a Bonneville-Babeuf connection, concludes (in an uncharacteris tically superficial analys is) that there is \"no doubt about the fact that the Social Circle exercised no influence on the formation of the communist revolutionary conception of Babeuf.\" (Babef, 325; repeated verbatim in \"Cercle,\" 73). But Dalin's discussion does not support any such judgment, never dealing with the nature of this conception (or indeed with ideas, organizational forms, or even revolutionary dynami cs). He genera lly ignores the role of Marechal and Varlet, let alone Restif; shows no curiosity about the survival of the Social Circle Press; and seems ideologica lly impelled to detach Babeuf at all points from the less socia lly radical views of Fauchet and Bonneville. If, of course, the influence were organizational and conspiratorial, the complete absence of written references to Bonneville (with whom Dalin admits Babeuf was closely familiar : Babef, 325) could be a sign of deliberate concealment. Babeuf's papers are notoriously silent on the conspiraf orial side. Babeuf attacked Bonneville as a \"false tribune of the people\" after Bonneville established his Old Tribune of the People in 1796 as a rival to Babeuf's new Tribune. Babeuf likened Bonne ville to the treacherous tribune Rufus Manlius who \"sold himself cravenly to the party of the rich in Rome\" in order to destroy the true tribune, Gracch us. Babeuf distinguished the brief period of Bonneville's authentic tribunate in 1789 from his subsequent descent into \"ministerial intrigue\" and \"slavish dependence\" on \"Mirabeau and other patricians.\" The excessive anger and Babeuf's erasure of his signature as \"Babeuf of the Confederation of the Friends of Truth\" may betray the classical technique of excoriating a revolutionary rival in the process of annexing his ideas and role. 235.

At its height in 1792-3, the publishing empire constituted a radical brain trust subsidized by the Girondist government, harshly critical of Jacobin centralism, regul arly publishing an intellectual review (Chronique du Mois ), an inexpensive journal for urban posting (Sentine!le ), a daily newspaper (Bull etin des Amis de la Verite ), and two journals taken over from others: La Feuille Villageoise for the French peasantry and Le Creole Patriote for the colonized West Indians.

Philippe Harivel,\" Revue d'Histoire Litteraire de la France, 1926, Jul-Sep, 408-14) nor his Preromantisme seriou sly discuss what the role of Bonneville actual ly was. Whatever their personal links, Babeuf clearly echoed Bonneville ' s symbolic lan­ guage in defining the destination for his organization. Babeuf focused the impulse for radical simplification onto a single-minded political program by suggesting a more inclusive concept of that \"central\" or \"perfect\" point that might provide new legitimacy. His conspiracy was to converge on a point unique located in space (the circle of conspirato rs), time (the coming social transformati on), and sentiment (the enduring quest for human satisfaction ). The stated purpose of Babeuf's con­ spiracy was \"to mark in advance a single point, towards which you will all strive without division, modifications, restrictions, or nuanc es; and to be circumscribed within a narrow circle of virtuous men, isolated from all who could oppose di­ vergent and contradicto ry views-from everything which could not be fused into the one and perfect sentiment of the highest point of goodnes s.\" Cited in J.

Even less is known about Bode and his mission than about other aspects of Illuminism during the period following its official suppression. His real name was apparently Theodor Heinrich Bode. Princely patronage was important in enabling him (and others) to spread Illum inist ideas beyond Bavaria to Germany as a whole (Grassl, 220-I ). His protean activities are most fully discussed in Fragmente zur Biogr aphie des verstorbenen Geheimen Rats Bode in Weimar, Rome, I795· See also Harivel, 23-5; Frost, I, 4I-2; and (for Bode's influence on Bonnevil le) Grassl, 26g-7I. Knigge appears to have had a direct influence on revolutionaries in Germany similar to that which Bode's diffusion of Illum inist ideas exercised in France. See the encomia of the German Jacobins on the occasion of Knigge's death in I796 : H. Viigt, Die deutsche jakobinische Literatur und Publizistik I78g- z8oo, I955, IS0-3. No one has yet sorted out facts from counter-revolutionary propaganda in Frag­ mente. Beiore his death in I793, Bode was apparently a composer of military music (E. Lennhoff and 0. Posner, Internationales Freimaurerlexikon, Zurich/Vienna, zg66, 196-8 ); and he shared Bonneville's literary interests as a translator of English proto-romantic literature (J.

Thus Bode influenced both the German playwright and his French translator, Bonne ville, who immediately published two more works, extending the Illuminist argument to a denunciation of the Scottish Rite Masons as well as of the Jesui ts: La Ma9onnerie ecossaise comparee avec les trois professions et le secret des Tern­ pliers, and Les ]esuites retrouves dans les tenebres, discussed in Mathiez, Annales Revol utionnaires, VIII, Igi6, 435 n. 2.

The suggest ion that Marechal might even have collab­ orated with the police in the denunciation of the conspiracy (made by G. Pariset, Babouvisme et mar;onnerie, Strasbourg, 1924 ) is effectively refuted by Bay lot (Voie, 96 ff.), whose identification of Marechal's membership in the occult lodge La Celeste Amitie and of Marechal's contempt for \"ordinary masonic lodges\" would be thoroughly compatible with an imitation if not a perpetu ation of Illuminism. 68.

There is no direct testimony beyond Prati's general statements that this social-revolutionary egalitarianism of Buonarroti predated his involvement in the Babeuf conspiracy. Dating of Buonarroti's frag­ mentary writings is notoriously uncertain ; and the clearly Illuminist elements in his formulations could predate or postdate the conspiracy. 84.

Fascination with multiple, interlocking triangles in occult Masonry led to such bizarre debates as whether the letter \"G\" inside the central triangle of one symbol (which included six other triple triang les) stood for the Grand Architect of the Universe (God), the higher science of Geometry, the hermaphrodite god of the Gnostics, or the usurpa­ tion of Maso nry by the General of the Jesuit Order (Bonneville's positi on).

The Rectified Scottish Rite was established in France at two conferences (Lyon in 1778 with the aid of a Lutheran clergyman, and Wilhelmsbad in 1782 under the patronage of the Duke of Brunswi ck) with the mystic Jean-Baptiste Willermoz as leader.

The best general account of the rise of occultism within French Maso nry prior to the revolution is in Chevallier, Histoire, I, 2II-56. The decisive starting point was the foundation in Paris of the Grand Orient in 1773 and the loosening of French dependence on the more casual, philanthropic Masonry which originated in England and had been limited to three grades. The proliferation of higher levels began with the spread of the rival system of \"Scottish\" Masonry. The influx into France of German occultism-a strikingly neglected subject in the Francocent ric historical literature-often took place within the 33 levels of the Scottish Rite. 134. E.

For the more general diffusion of mystical ideas in Lyon, see J, Buche, L'Ecole mystique de Lyon. 1776-r847, 1935· A favorite label among Lyonnais occultists was \"friend of truth\" ; a more secular group of occultists in Avignon used its Greek form, Philali!thes; and these in turn may have given birth to the Philadelphians of Narbonne.

Schmidt, Court de Gebelin ii Paris (r763-I784), Geneva, rgo8, by no means exhausts this subject. Court was a Parisian partisan of the German Reforma­ tion, which he considered the first break with tyranny since Nebuchadnezzar, and was the first Frenchman to discuss the proto-romantic artistic ideas of Johann Winckelmann (Monde primitif analyse et compare avec le monde moderne, 1 77 5, III, xviii ).

IS4· The United Irishmen, founded in 1791 to establish links with the French Revolution, combined Catholics and Protestants under a secret, s-man center, which sought to work through similar subordinate committees. The classic biography of their leader alleges a \"close connection between Freemasonry and the United Irish­ men,\" arguing that \"a large proportion of Masonic Lodges were practica lly revolu­ tionary committ ees.\" (F. MacDermot, Theobald Wolfe Tone, L, 1938, 8g.) Frost in­ sists that there was \"very little of the Masonic element at any time\" in the United Irishmen, but that their reorganization of I79S created a \"system closely resembling that of the Illuminati\" (Societies, I, 62, 6o). A former police official in Ireland argues for far-reaching Illuminist impact (largely on the basis of the neglected pamphlet of R. Clifford, The Application of Barruel's Memoirs of ]acob inism to the Secret Societies of Ireland and Great Britain, L/Dublin, 1798 ) in H. Pollard, The Secret Societies of Ireland. Their Rise and Progress, L, 1922. See especi ally Appendix A, \"Illuminism and the United Irishmen,\" 2s7'-63. None of these studies provides documentation. After suppression of the United Irishmen in 1797-8 and the act of Union with England in I8oi, Irish revolutionaries gradu ally regrouped into the more narrowly Catholic Ribbon Society, whose hierarchy of I8os revealed a master and three close followers, each of whom had 12 subordinate brothers (E. Lennhoff, Histoire des societes secretes au xixe et xxe siecles, 1934, 139-42 ). This \"apostolic\" model of the 12-man unit tended to prevail in Catholic Ireland over the Pythagorean model. In­ deed, the United Irishmen also used units of 12 (T. Williams, ed., Secret Societies in Ireland, NY/Du blin, 1973, 63).

Linkov (r66-7, 242) follows the usual Soviet practice of minimizing foreign influences. 161. South Slav revolutionaries formed an anti-Turkish organization Omla dina with a cellular net centered on a s-man \"honorary\" presidium (Garibaldi, Mazzini, Cobden, Herzen, and Chernyshevsky ), and a Russian revolutionary Ivan Bochkarev forged a link by organizing Serbian students in St. Petersburg, then journeying to Belgrade in 1867 to attend a meeting of Omla dina (Venturi, 352-3 ). A later or­ ganization bearing the same name (the short-lived Czech Om lad ina of the r 89os) developed the metaphor of the hand. See A. Vesel y , Omladina a pokrokove hnuti, Prague, 1902, 167-73; G.

Modern conspiracy in some ways derives from fascin ation with the Genoese re­ publican conspiracy of Fiesco against Charles V. This anti-Hapsburg plot was partly aided by the French in the sixteenth century, and subsequently inspired both a theoretical treatise by the IS-year-old Cardinal de Retz (Conjuration de Fiesque, I632) and the pioneering melodrama of the young Schiller (Die Verschworung des Fiesco, I7S2-3 ). The impulse to struggle is built into the very title of Bazin's Jacquel ine d'Olzebourg.

J. Starck and others subseq uently corrected Ba rruel by distinguishing Illuminism more clearly from Ma sonry . Fear of Illuminism tended to vary in inverse proportion to proximity ; and was perhaps most extreme in distant America, where real Illuminists were absent and revolutionary enthusiasm waning by the late 17 90s : see V.

Lautaro, the leader of the Araucanian opposition, lent his name to the original Masonic lodge (founded by Miranda in London in 1796 ) which was expanded into a chain of lodges in Chile, Argentina, and Peru involving O'Higgins and others in the preparation of national revolutions.

The first use of the term \"Communionist\" as a social rather than religious term was in Co-operative Magazine, r827, Nov, 509 (Bestor, \"Evolution,\" 278 ), and in the later r83os the radical Owenites called themselves \"Communionists\" and established The Working Bee as their weekly journal. Already in 1840, the first historian of socialism, L. Reybaud, noted that the im­ pulse behind the utopian experiments of Owen and Fourier were \"a return to nature rather than a call to the refinements of civilization\" (Etude, 25). Fourier went even farther in the direction of pastoral fantasy with his famous \"phalanstery,\" his con­ trast between false and ugly vs. \"natural and attractive\" forms of association, and his cosmic vision of natural harmony and erotic links even between astral bodies.

In North Italy, much of the prepar ation for revolution had been done by the Masonic lodges which had been politicized by the influx of young pro-French officers prior to their forced dissolution in 1SI4 (R. Soriga, Il prima Grande Oriente d'Italia, Pavia, Igi7). This process occurred only after IS14 in Spain, but developed very rapidly (de la Fuente, Sociedades, I, 2og-3I3). It also affected Portugal, but largely by way of Brazil, where the brief republican uprising of 1S17 had a partly Masonic provenance (V.

In r8ro, Spaniards began using the term partido libre to designate those favoring a free press and constitutional reforms, substituting the term partido lib­ eral with the same meaning in r813. M.

The contrast was heightened by hyphenating the term \"servile\" to accentuate its component parts ser-vil, \"to be vile\" (157). Neutrality was not possible in the polarized moral climate : \"No seas neutral/ 0 servil o liberal\" (r66). For another discussion of the sudden politicization of a term with multiple earlier Spanish uses, see J. Marichal, \"Espana y las raices semanticas del liberalismo,\" Cuadernos, Ig55, Mar-Apr, esp. 57-60. 35. This is the earliest usage suggested in the most thorough discussion of the migration of the term from Spain (E. Halevy, A Histor y of the English People r8 r5- I83o, NY, rg23, 8r n. I). The usages cited therein are not included in the Oxford English Dictionary, rg33, VI, 237-8, which lists a venerable tradition of nonpolitical meani ngs: liberal arts (as distinct from mechanical techniqu es), freedom from restraint in speech or action, and freedom from philosophical prejudice. The only instance cited therein of a modern political usage prior to r8r2 is in I8oi by Helen Maria Williams, who uses the term only very generally in the sense of a moderate foe of despotism.

From the trial of Pestel in Vosst aniia, IV, 112, 90-1. Pestel believed the revo­ lution would spread even to \"those two opposites England and Turkey\" (ibid., 105).

Spanish influence was also important on the Russian poet Denis Davydov, who was the first to develop a theory of \"partisan\" warfare, and to popularize the term \"people's war\" (E. Tarle, Sochineniia, 1959, VII, 686). Five days before the battle of Borodino, Davydov took so hussars and So cossacks out of regular units to harass Napoleon with unconventional warfare and to recruit peasants by using a blend of Asian and European methods and choosing leaders from those proven in battle \"and not from clerks in central offices\" (Opyt teorii partizanskogo deistviia, 1819, 76-7, also 42 ) . He stopped speaking French and wearing aristocratic clothes, arguing that \"in a people's war one should not only speak the language of the masses (iazykom cherni ), but also adopt their customs and dress\" (Dnevnik partizanskikh deistvii r8r2 gada, in Voennye zapiski, 1940, 208. This work, begun in 1825, too late to influence his Decembrist friends, was finished in 1838 and first published in full only in 186o: ibid ., 437- 8.) Perhaps the most brilliant practitioner of guerrilla warfare against Napoleon was the northern Haitian leader Sans Souci, who was feared even by the native leader Jean Christophe, who assassi nated him early in 1803 (H. Trouillot, \"Le Vodou dans Ia guerre de !'independence,\" Revista de Historia de America, 1972, Jul-Dec, 87- 90). Late in 1813, Napoleon himself drew up plans for a national resistance move­ ment to the expected invasion of France for corps de partisans fighting with farm implements a total war with point de regles and the promise of patentes de partisan granting extensive rights to local leaders (Vermale, Conspirateur, 84-5.) But all these precedents were virtually unknown. The major influence from the period was the conservative Prussian general Karl von Clausewitz, whose section on the \"arm­ ing of the people\" for a \"people's war\" provided a systematic treatise on defensive guerrilla warfa re: Vom Krieg, Bonn, 1952, 697-704, and 618 for the use of the term \"part isan.\" His influence came much later, however, largely on Lenin; and the dominant influences for most of the nineteenth century were Italian and Polish writers to be discussed later. 88. Nechkina, after decrying the lack of study of this founding group and estab­ lishing its purely Masonic forms, lamentably fails to consider possible foreign in­ fluences on \"the first Russian revolutionary organization\" : Dvizhenie, I, 141-7. 89.

The Saint-Simonians, whom we shall discuss subsequently, dreamed of including an opera house along­ side a palace of industry in their temples of humanity, and made florid operatic experiments on their mission to the East that followed this trial.

Porter (The New Yorker, I973, Jan 6, 59-62) with Brecht/ Weill; W.

Insufficient attention has been paid to the operatic compositions and theories about the musical stage of such proto-revolutionary figures as Rousseau and Beau­ marchais. The latter's plays both inspired later operas by others and helped incite the original French Revolution. Napoleon later remarked \"If I had been king, a man such as he would have been locked up ... The Marriage of Figaro is already the revolution in action.\" Cited in F. Grendel, Beaumarchais, L, 1977, 220. On the other hand, too much attent ion may have been paid to the alleged revo­ lutionary messages in Mozart. R. Koch's argument for Illuminist influence on Mo­ zart's last opera is viewed skeptic ally by J. Chailley, The Magic Flute: Masonic Opera, NY, 1971, 62-5; and C. Rosen points out the purely musical reasons even for passages that sometimes excited revolutionaries (such as the rousing accom­ paniment to Don Giovanni's \"Viva la libertil .\") The Classical Style, NY, 1971, 94-5· Sta robinski, however, suggests a deeper link between the late Mozart operas and the coming of revolution, arguing that Mozart depicts the role confusions of a dying"},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"s 6o Chapter 6 order (\"this vertigo without future or past ... in which social ranks are lost, and bitterness, pleasure, transvestite illusion, blame and pardon are all confused\" ). He finds the voluptuous passions of Don Giovanni (for whom \"the only religion is lib­ erty\" and \"limits exist only to be transgr essed\" ) prophetic of the early, aristocratic phase of the revolution in which the erotic energy of \"the heroic and scandalous figure of Mirabeau\" universalized libertarian goals.

Marechal's program for public instruction in the revolution (Almanach des nipublicains, I793, I-S) began with a long section on Tell, who was credited with inventing the revolutionary red cap.

Dommanget suggests that the use of the red flag was by no means as widespread in Paris in 1848 as subsequent revolutionary historiography usually contends. Among other studies, F.

A. Schoyen, \"From Green Flag to Red\" (The Chartist Challenge, L, 1958, 171-98) shows that the red flag made partial incursion into the vacuum left during 1848 by the discrediting of the green banner of the Chartists. An unpublished essay of E. Gombrich (kindly lent me by the author ) traces an anticipation of the red-for-tricolor substitution in the replacement of the bonnet rouge (the Phrygian cap) for the cocarde tricolor during the original French Revo­ lution. The red cap had social rather than political overto nes, since it was taken from a Swiss regiment that had rebelled against aristocratic officers in Aug 1790, been subsequently sentenced as galley slaves, then lionized in Paris as popular heroes after amnesty in Nov 1791: The Dream of Reason. Propaganda Symbolism in the French Revol ution, 13-6.

Nikolaevsky, \"Za vashu i nashu volnost'-str anitsi iz istorii russk o-polskikh otnoshenii,\" Navy zhurnal, 1944, no. 7, 252-76) is viewed skeptica lly by Malia ( H erzen, 4 73) and by A. Walicki (in a joint seminar meeting with Nikolaevsky at Harvard University in 1959 ). Glorifi­ cation of ancient Slavonic communalism was widespread in the Polish emigration, and could have come from many figures other than Lelewel. See, for instance, P. Brock on the leading figure of the Lud Polski, \"Zeno S wi<cto sYawski, a Polish fore­ runner of the Russian Narodniki,\" American Slavic and East European Review, XIII, 1954, no. 4, 566-87; and, more fully, his Revo lutionary Populism in Poland, Toronto, 1977, which contends that Poland in effect produced a full-fledged agrarian populist movement between its revolutions of r830 and 1863, anticipating most of the main features of the better-known Russian movement that follo wed.

Histoire militaire, I76-7, for many examples and references. The Polish fascination with light, portable weapons may also have owed something to the two pistols (engraved E pluribus unum ) that Kosciuszko had received as a farewell gift from George Washington (ibid., I25). Kukiel suggests a possi ble influence of Kosciuszko on Bianco (\"Military Aspects,\" 36S-g ), though his speculation seems questionable in view of his misiden tification of Bianco elsewhere (\"Problemes des guerres d'insurrection au XIX siecle,\" Ante­ murale, 1955, So). Bianco's work is wrongly attributed to Mazzini in Histoire militaire, z8z.

Buon arroti did not include Russia in his list of failed revo­ lutions, perhaps because the Decembrists had developed a variety of ideas on this subject (See M. Murav'ev, \"ldeia vremennogo pravitel'stva u dekabristov i ikh kandidaty,\" in Tainye obshche stva, 68-87 ). The main group called for a three­ month rule by provisional power during which full authority would be transferred to a new national assembly ( 84); but some Decembrists envisaged the provisional government affecting radical social reforms ( 70). There is no certainty that Buona rroti had any contact with Decembrists until the mid-I830S through the brothers N. and A. Turgenev in Paris (see the latter's \"Parizh,\" Sovremennik, I836, no. I, 275), though Semevsky suggests the possibility of more extensive contacts (Idei, 536).

He argued that the tragic experience of Spain argued against either dissipating author­ ity in assemblies or prematurely receiving foreign ambassadors. Hence the need for a Condott iero Supremo even within the provisional governme nt: ibid., II, 229-3 I, 239 ff. Saitta hypothesizes that Buonarroti's Veri Italiani were in fact identical with Bianco's Apofasimeni (Buonarroti, I, 203, supported by E. Ragionieri, Belfagor, VI, no. I, I95I, Jan, II2-3).

The passage was apparen tly written early in 1834 (129-30 ). Blanqui's \"L'intellig ence, ce sont des hommes de devoue­ ment ... \" thus defines \"intelligence\" as people devoted to both thought and revo­ lution. The German pejor ative usage of Intelligenz-Intelligenzen during the Revolu­ tion of 1848-49 is closer in sound to the Russian intelligent-intelligentsia (R. Pipes, \"'Intelligentsia' from the German 'Intel ligen z'?

The latter depicts the shipwrecked \"icanarfs\" (franr;ais ) living on an island under a despotic \"Ponelano\" (Napoleon ), and describes its transformation into \"true happiness\" (vrai bonheur being the anagram for Ruvare bohni ) of a Christian communist \"community of goods\" that breaks down all vestiges of selfish acquisi­ tivene ss, including the family.

Bertier de Sauvigny, \"Liberalism,\" I47-66, analyzes three distinct (and usu­ ally success ive) stages in the history of an important new political label : the mor­ phological creation of a new word, its semantic association with a new concept, and its lexical maturity, when it comes into common usage. The birth of commu­ nism, which he does not discuss, provides a unique example of all three stages occurring virtually simultaneously. Even the previously discussed and altogether disconnected prehistory of this word by Restif de la Bretonne in the eighteenth century was abrupt rather than evolu­ tionary. Restif created the word morphologically in order to express a full-blown semantic meaning. The only indication of any possible intervening printed use of the term between Restif in the 1790s and I840 is an undocumented attribution to Lamennais in Dauzat , Nouveau dictionnaire, I82.

The first Italian usage is traced from the French and dated I84o without precise references in S. Battaglia, Grande Dizionario della lingua ital­ iana, Turin, III, 448. A. Bobkov indicates that shortly after Jan, I837, an agent of Metternich reported that Schuster's League of Outlaws was conducting \"now democratic, now commu­ nist, now republican agitation\" (\"K istorii raskola soiuza otverzhennykh v I836- I837 godakh,\" Novaia i Noveishaia Istoriia, I959, no. 5, I0 2 ). But the original article from which Bobkov took his reference makes it clear that this report dated in fact from I843 (G. Wendel, \"Vorlaufer des Sozialismus,\" Der Abend, Ig2g. Nov Ig). Ig. The rapid spread of the new term can be traced in three early surve ys: the generally sympathetic work of L. von Stein, Der Socialismus und Communismus des heutigen Frankreichs, Leipzig, I842 ; the very alarmist L. de Carne, \"De quel­ ques publications democratiques et communistes,\" Revue des Deux Mondes, 184I, Sep I, 724-47; the antagonistic but relatively schola rly L. Reybaud, \"Des idees et des sectes communistes,\" Revue des Deux Mondes, I842, Jul I, 5-47. This latter work, which I discovered only after completing this section, has no precise documentation but suggests in general terms a direction close to that which I develop here-pa rticularly stressing the roles of Buonarroti, Owen, and Cabet­ and suggests ( 28) that communism as a conscious and organized movement began only after the failure of the Blanquist insurrection in May, I83g.

Almost every point of view on the Left produced a supporting interpretat ion of the French Revolution during the period between the revolutions of 1830 and 1848. The basic text for egalitarian social revolutionaries remained Buonarroti's History of the Conspiracy of Equals; for revolutionary national ists, Michelet's work ; for liberal national ists, Adolphe Thiers's Histoire de la Revolution fran{:aise ( 1836 and numerous subsequent editio ns). Christian socialists leaned on Buchez's In­ troduction a la science de l'histoire, and his Histoire parlementaire de la Revolu­ tion fran{:aise (written in collaboration with Roux-Lavargne between 1833 and 1838); idealistic secular socialists, on Louis Blanc's Histoire de la Revolution fran{:aise (first two v, 1847 ); etc. Annales Historiques de la Revolution Fran{:aise, 1966, Apr-Jun , is almost entirely devoted to analyzing the views on the French Revolution of early French socialists. 41.

Dezamy's neglected impact on Marx is dis­ cussed in D. Riazanov, Ocherki po istorii marksizma, 1923, 76-7. The mysterious figure of Nicholas Speshnev, who introduced the idea of revo­ lutionary communism into Russia in the mid-forties, sided with Dezamy against Cabet. (See his letter to a Polish friend in V. Evgrafova, ed., Filosofskie i obshc hest­ venno-politicheskie proizvedeniia petrashevtsev, 1953, 488-502 .) The early years of Speshnev, like the late ones of Dezamy, remain an enigma. Speshnev apparently fought in the Swiss civil war during the early 184os and became the partial model for Stavrogin in Dostoevsky's Possessed. He never fulfilled his promise to explain fully the communist beliefs he propagated in Russia in the late forties (see Litera­ turnoe nasledstvo, LXIII, 1956, 171-2). His idea (later developed by Bakunin ) that an inner communist group would supersede the Jesuits could have been inspired by Dezamy's Le ]esuitisme of 1845, though it dates back, as we have seen, to the Illuminists and Bonneville. Speshnev advocated that the central committee have three coequal subordinate bodie s: Jesuitical, propagandistic, and revolutionary. 76. In addition to Le ]esuitisme, see his Examen critique des huit discours sur le Catholicisme et la philosophie, prononces a Notre-Dame, en decembre z844 et en janvier z845, etc. par M. Dezamy d'apri!s les principes de la philosoph ie naturelle, 1845 ; and his Organisation de la liberte et du bien-etre universe!, 1846, cited and discussed in Garaudy, Sources, 199-200. Garaudy, who was then a leading French communist intellectual, reproduces Dezamy's refutation of Lamennais (209-1 8) as a kind of model for answering objections to communism. Dezamy is also praised in the neglected brochure of Benoit Malon, Le Parti ouvrii!r en France, 1882. 77· Question, s6. 78. Ibid., 65, also 64. 79· P.

Volgin also points out (Frantsuzsky utopichesky kommu­ nizm, 1960, 25-6 ) that Pillot used a sophisticated if functional class analysis of the roles played in the reaction by different \"castes.\" 81. After Cabet's Voyage and Adventures of Lord William Carisdale in Icaria was first published in a small London edition (the French original purportedly trans­ lated from English ) in 1839, a Paris edition appeared in Jan 1840, closely followed by translations into German, Spanish, and English along with additional digested and paraphrased editions. (See F. Rude, Voyage en Icarie. Deux ouvriers viennois aux Etats-Unis en z855, 1952, esp. 5; and A. Lehning, \"Discussions a Londres sur le communisme icarien,\" Bulletin of the International Institute of Social History, 1952, no. 2, 87 and ff.). The book was subtitled a \"philosophical and social novel\" -the exact term used as a subtitle by Flora Tristan's Mephis ou le proletaire of 1838, one of the most influential of the artistically second-rate, but propagan­ distic \"social novels\" of the 183os. See D. Evans, \"Le roman social sous la man­ archie du juillet, Romans democratiques. L'apotheose du proletaire,\" French Quar­ terly, 1931, Sep, esp. 104; also A. Zevaes, \"Le Mouvement social sous la resta uration et sous la monarchie de juillet,\" La Revo lution de z848, 1936-7, Dec-Jan-Feb, 232 ff. The better prose fiction of the pre-1848 era, of course, also focused the attention of thinking people on the plight of the urban masses from the London of Dickens's Oliver Twist to the Paris of Hugo's Les Miserables and Sue's Mysteres de Paris, to the St. Petersburg of Gogol and the early Dostoevsky. Thus, it might be said that the prosaic media (including Daumier's lithographed cartoons and the didactic pamph­ lets produced by the new high-speed printing as well as the programmatic novel ) contributed to the rationalistic ideas of the social revolutionaries almost as much as the poetic media of romantic music and lyric poetry contributed to the rival and more emotional ideal of the nationa l revolutionar ies. If vernacular opera was in some ways, as we have suggested, the highest cultural expression of revolutionary nationalism, the ideological novel like Icaria may have played a similar role for social revolutionarie s. Probably the most influential of all were the immensely pop­ ular novels of George Sand, which successf ully fused propaganda and art into the quasi-religious communism of her Le Meunier d'Angibault (1845-6 ) and Le peche de M. Antoine (1847). See Evans, Socialisme, 124-31. 82. According to C. Tsuzuki, \"Robert Owen and Revolutionary Politics,\" in S. Pollard and J. Salt, eds., Robert Owen Prophet of the Poor, Lewisburg, Pa., 1971, 34· 83. See H. Desroche, \"Images and Echoes of Owenism in Nineteen th-Century France,\" in ibid., 246-7. See Saitta, Buonarroti, I, 64-9.

Owen, 1828, called for \"la communaute de jouissance des produits, basee sur l'egalite,\" 33. Rey then set up an Owenite Cooperative Society in Paris (J. Gans, \"Robert Owen a Paris en 1837, \" Le Mouvement Social, 1962, Oct-Dec, 35). Buonarroti himself hailed Owen as early as 1828 (History of the Conspiracy, cited in Pollard, Owen, 248) and grew to admire him even more in his late years. See the important article relating Owen much more intimately to the revolution ary tradition than is usual : A. Mathiez, \"Babeuf et Robert Owen compares et defendus par Buonarroti,\" La Revol ution de z848, 1910, 233-9. Engels discovered Owen's teachings simultaneously with the English proletariat on his first visit to a factory in Manchester in 1843, contributing two important articles on continental socialism to Owen's New Moral World, 1843, Nov 4, 18 (Riazanov, Ocherki, 44-5, zoo-z ). There are some 300 extracts from Owen-by far the most from any earlier socialist thinker-in Marx's notebooks of 1845-7- See M.

Gay tried unsucces sfully both to collaborate with Laponneraye's Intelligence in 1838-g and to found his own journal CommunauUi. Bulletin Mensuel de la Sci­ ence Sociale (Gans, 36-45 ). The latter effort probably inspired Dezamy's short-lived new journal of 1840, Communautaire.

Thompson never­ theless assumes (in his title, introduction, and conclusion ) that his subject is a unitary, proto-revolutionary, self-conscious entity. There is almost no empirical evi­ dence or extended argumentat ion for such an assumption. Thompson avoids the term \"proletariat\" but not the implic ation (recurrent among English intellectua ls) that \"the working class\" in Britain might somehow have created a revolution if it had adopted the secular revolutionary consciousness of intellectuals rather than its own melange of religi ous, reformist, and rebellious impulses. 252.

Draper is not persuasive in suggesting (32) that Marx simply made up the slogan and attributed it retroac tively to 1848. The possibilities of Blanquist influence on Marx cannot be ruled out and have never been systema­ tically investigated. Marx was in touch with Blanquists during his visit to Paris in Jun 184g (Dommanget, Idees, 377); and Marx's admiration for Blanqui was par­ ticularly strong in Feb 1850, just before the revival of the League (Mikhailov, Istoriia, 388-g ). Another possible French channel (not mentioned by Domma nget) is Jules Gay, whose journal Le Communiste appeared for one issue in Mar 1849 (Babeuf et les problemes, 276). Marx had praised Gay along with Dezamy as \"more scient ific French Communists,\" who \"are developing the doctrine of materialism in the sense of a doctrine of real humanism and as the logical base of Communism\" (Holy Family cited in Garaudy, Sources, 1g1 ) . The gap in the Marx-Engels correspondence from A ug 23, 184g, to Nov 1g, 1850, deprives historians of direct testimony to in­ fluences on Marx during this critical period when Blanquist influence was at its height. 30g. Noyes, 286-7, 366-7. The Germans had long nurtured a fascination, often based on fear, that revolution might become a permanent as well as global condi­ tion-from the complaint of 1814 about \"der allgemeinen Weltrevolution unserer Zeit\" (Malinkrodt, \"Was tun bei Deutschlands und Europas Wiedergebur t?\" cited in Seidler, 2g7) through the retrospec tive essay on the events of 1848-5 1, which spoke of \"die grunds atzliche permanente Erhebung des Volkes tiber aile gegebene Obrigkeit\" (F. Stahl, Was ist Revolution? 1852, in Seidler, 2g1 n. a). As with so much else, this concept appears to have originally been derived from Illum inist usage. The Bavarian occultist Franz von Baader noted already in his diary for Aug 14, 1786, symptoms einer uns allgemein bevorstehenden Revo lution (Grassl, \"Zum Bede utungswandel des Wortes 'Revolution,' \" Aufbruch, 42g-32), and appears to have returned to elaborate this idea in his 1834 essay Revol utionis­ mus (Seidler, 2g1 n. a). 310.

In Marx's book defending the accused (Enthilllungen ilber den Kommu­ nistenprozess zu Kiiln, Basel, 1853; tr. with intr. by R. Livingstone, The Cologne Communist Trial, L/NY, 1971 ), he attacked the Willich group for conspiratorial excesses and suggested that his own mission was to build \"the opposition party of the future\" on a new and different basis (Werke, VIII, 461; McLellan, 252 ). Marx attempted to start the germ of such a party by grouping 6o Germans into a Work­ ers' Association that met twice a week late in 1851 before it disintegrated when its key members rejoined the larger Willich group in the late summer of 1852.

Proudhon opposed Louis Blanc's state-organized social workshops as part of the \"artificial centra lization\" (Solution du probleme social, Oeuvres, VI, 13) that Parisians were forever imposing on the rest of France, and argued that the \"working classes\" (not, in his language, a unitary \"proletar iat\") were best served not in \"capturing, but in defeating both power and monopoly\" (Confessions, 166, cited Allen, s). 59· The unification of Italy and Germany in the 186os is seen not just as the victory of modern nationalism, but also as the defeat of a prior predilection through­ out Europe for \"federative experim ents\" in Binkley, Realism, 181 ff. 6o.

See discussion in Saitta, \"L'idea di Europa,\" espec ially of Giuseppe Ferrari, the Italian sympathizer of Proudhon who feared that the advent of large states would destroy European domi­ nance altogether in favor of America, Russia, and perhaps eventually China (Ferrari, La Chine et !'Europe, r 867, 598). Ferrari, though himself a professor, also shared Proudhon's fear of intellectuals in power. See his Les philosophes salaries occupes a organiser une reaction occulte, 1849. See Ferrari's study of Proudhon ( 1875) published in C. Sainte-Beuve, P. j. Proudhon sa vie et correspondance r838-r848, Milan, 1947, 375-424; also C.

Yet Proudhon rejected decentralization that was purely political in nature, such as that urged by a German foe of Marx, Moritz Rittinghausen, who argued for a Swiss type of direct, local legislation . To Proudhon, this was even worse than electing representatives to a distant assembly, for direct legislation implicates people in transact ing uniform and restrictive laws, while elected legislators might still retain flexibility and represent diversity.

The misinterpretations of Proudhon, which portray him as an advocate of war, take out of context his earlier section tracing the stubborn appeal of war and the dependence of much of history and art upon it. Proudhon has even been accused of proto-fascism. See J. Shapiro, \"Pierre­ Joseph Proudhon, Harbinger of Fascism,\" American Historical Review, I94S, Jul, 7I4-37· 71. Dolleans, Proudhon, 377-82 . 72.

In combating both church and state, Proudhon drew solace from the example of Christ (\"I fight against the stron g; I do not crush the weak\"-cited in Lubac, 6s) and from images of Christian apocalypse (looking forward in his \"Revolutionary Manifesto\" to the imminent time \"when civilization will appear to us as a perpetual apocalypse ... when by the reform of society Chris­ tianity will have found its second strength\" [Le Peuple, I848, Sep 2; in Dollea ns, Proudhon, 149]). In his last work he charac terized the French working classes as \"this Paraclete for whose coming the apostles waited\" (De la Capacite, I29-30 ). He left behind the manuscript for an uncompleted opus, Caeser ism and Christianity, in part to answer Renan's portrayal of Christ as a dreamy mystic in his Life of Jesus. 76. E. Simmons, Leo Tolstoy, Boston, 1946, 649-so. 77. See particularly Proudhon's \"Toast a la revolution,\" Le Peuple, I848, Oct I7, in Dolleans, Proudhon, ISO, 2IS; \"il n'y a pas eu plusieurs revolutions, in n'y a eu qu'une revolution. La Revolution, il y a dix-huit siecles, s'appelait l'Evangile, la bonne nouvelle .... Ces chretiens, ces revolutionnaires firent la premiere et la plus grande des revolutions ... la Revolution est en permanence ... il n'y a eu qu'une seule et meme et perpetuelle revolution.\" 78. Tolstoy's debt to Proudhon has yet to be fully studied. A beginning has been made in S. Lafitte, \"Tolstoi, Herzen et Proudhon,\" in Studi in onore di Ettore Lo Gatto e Giovanni Maver, Florence, I962, 38I-93. Proudhon not only influenced Tol­ stoy's opposition to war and to the state power that created it after meeting him in Brussels the year he published La Guerre et la pa'ix; Proudhon also influenced the Russian emigre Baron F. Fircks (Schedo-Ferroti ), who published in I864 in Brussels Le Program du congres europeen. This was a Proudhonist project to deny capitalists the right to make armaments, and governments the right to declare war. See Dom­ manget, Blanqui et !'opposition revolutionnaire a la fin du second empire, 1960, IS ff. 79· M. Buber, Paths in Utopia, L, 1949, 24-37, 86, 88, I46-9. J. Bancal has developed Buber's idea into a distinction between Proudhonian \"topian socialism\" (organically rooted somewhere, however minutely ) and the \"utopian socialism\" of intellectuals (located only in the megalomanic mind ). See Proudhon pluralisme et autogestion, 1970, II, ISS. Ba ncal calls Proudhon a \"prophet of the XXI century\" (II, 232-4 ) with his advocacy of worker autonomy (autoges­ tion), personalism (II, 219-20), and a radical pluralism compatible with the \"functional pluralism of modern science\" (I, 181 ).

Proudhon's influential journals of this period built on links with the typographical society to help organize a Bank for the People offering cheap credit and mutual aid for workers (ibid., 176-82). 68. Barely one-quarter of the 171 new periodicals founded after the overthrow of Louis Philippe on Feb 25, 1848, survived for more than a brief period after Jun 17 (ibid., 183 ). The symbolic father figure of revolutionary journalism, \"Pere Duchene,'' reappeared briefly in Jun as an \"author\" in the official journal of the workers' delegates from the department of the Seine, Journal des Travailleurs, but was soon transformed (in the title of a new journal of July) into Le Perdu Chene de la Revolution (the lost oak of the revolu tion) (ibid., 170). 6g. The demise in 1858 of Ernest Jones's People's Paper, the last official journal of the Chartist movement, ended all British leadership for transnational working­ class movements. The very title, Bee-Hive, of the most important new working-class newspaper of the r86os (founded by the carpenter George Potter \"in the interest of the working classe s\") suggests its mid-Victorian preoccupation with non­ ideological day-to-day concerns.

The basic name of the First International was rich in Chartist association, their basic organization, the London Workingmen's Associat ion of Jun 1836, having taken its name from a group founded in May to fight the \"tax on knowledge,\" the Association of Working Men to Procure a Cheap and Honest Press. The Working­ men's Associa tion had begun the tradition of Chartist internat ionalism in Nov 1838 with a pioneering call for solidarity to Belgian workers appealing for Anglo-Belgian­ Dutch-Rhineland worker collaboration.

Marxist historians downplay the extent of Marx's dependence on Blanquists even as they provide evidence of links with Marxism in the fight against Prou­ dhonism/Bakuninism. S. Bernstein alleges that the rival Bakuninist Alliance was founded in the presence of Blanqui late in 1868 (The Beginnings of Marxian Socialism in France, NY, 1965, 2d ed., xiv), but also suggests that Marx persuaded Blanqui to send delegates to the Geneva Congress in 1867, only to have them re­ jected by Proudhonists then and in 1868. M. Paz argues that \"it is in their parallel and persistent animosity against Proudhon that Blanqui and Marx find each other\" (\"Auguste Blanqui, le revolu­ tionnaire professionel,\" unpublished doctoral thesis, Aix-en-Pro vence, 1974, 132, BN; also 131-5 for Blanqui's conflict with Proudhon and his disciples, and 138-53 for his influence on Marx and Lenin ).

In 1873, at the height of his struggle with Marx, Bakunin explained that he had changed the name of his Italian Alliance of Social Democracy of 1864 into the Alliance of Socialist Revolutionaries \"as a result of the German state com­ munists giving the term 'social democracy' a compromising, doctrinaire and state meaning\" (Istoricheskoe razvit ie internatsionala, Zurich, 1873, part I, cited in Lehning, \"Conception,\" 62 ). 166.

Kolakowski (Currents, III, 51) develops the idea that Kautsk y was, in effect, only extending the modifications that Engels had already made in Marx's philosophy (Currents, I, 376-408 ). This distinction (like the more fashionable one in the late 1960s ) between the early Marx of the Philosophical Manuscripts and the later Marx of Capital is rejected for dogmatic reasons by the Marxist-Leninist hagiographical establishment. While too much can be made of these differ ences, the Engels intro­ duction is clearly almost a direct, anticipatory rejection of the Leninism that was to come as well as of the Blanquism of the past in its insistence that the time \"of revolutions carried through by small conscious minorities at the head of uncon­ scious masses, is past\" (Reader, 420). 54.

Frey, Les Transformations du vocab ulaire fram;ais a l'epoque de la revolution (r78g-r 8oo), I925, I65).

Tkachev's initial reference in r865 to a passage from Critique of Political Economy included the full-blown assert ion that \"this idea has now be­ come common to all thinking and honest men, and no intelligent man can find any serious objec tion to it.\" Philosophical materi alism helped move Tkachev from a reformist to a revolu­ tionary position (R.

A recent Soviet study (1. Al'tman, \"Programma gruppy A. I.

The article weakly attempts to sustain the view more congenial to Leninist hagiography that the group represented an ideologic ally progressive stage in the evolution from populism to Marxism.

Dangerfield, The Strange Death of Liberal England, I9IO -I9I4, NY, 1961, itemizes the many forms of violence-some of them still without adequate study­ that tore at England during this \"peaceful\" period; and the thesis suggested by his title could be extended to other \"liberal\" nations as well. 2. This subject was treated in \"When Peace Was the Establishment,\" a presenta­ tion by R. Stromberg at the Woodrow Wilson Internat ional Center for Scholars on Aug 5, 1974.

The Tillys here distinguish (SI-S and elsewhere ) among three different types of violence that tend to be succes sively dominant despite much overlapp ing: compet itive (testing strength within a local system of power ), reactive (fighting off a challenge to established rights), and pro-active (asserting new rights-as the \"new unionists\" and revolutionary syndicalists saw themselves doing ). 7· Recent scholarship traces the rise of this more radical \"new unionism\" in Britain back to the I87os.

William Benbow, Grand National Holiday and Congress of the Productive Classes, L, 1832. He called for a month of total withdrawal from the productive process during the summer by all \"plundered fellow sufferers\" during which a Congress of the Working Classes was to devise a social plan for the future. Elaborate preparations would assure that participation \"be not partial but universal\" ; and delegations of workers would \"speak daggers but use none\" in persuading property holders to support this modern version of the Jewish sabbatical year and the year of Jubilee. Though there was no plan for annexing political power, Benbow's prescrip­ tion for gradua lly escalating the size of delegations (from 20 to zoo to I,ooo) to recalcitrant representatives of \"the grasping and blood-sucking few\" and his an­ nouncement in the pamphlet of his intention to found a \"purely political\" journal with the title taken from Babeuf- all point to a relatively full-blown conception of a revolutionary general strike.

The number of strikers in the Paris region had been less than half that of the northern region in 1900-5 (about g1,ooo to 1g6,ooo), but the number became more than twice as large during 1906-II (about 382,000 to 169,ooo ) (Dalin, g). Gustave Herve (La Guerre Sociale, no. 37, 1913, cited in Dalin, 213-4 ) insisted that the C.G.T. had in fact become a political party capable of directly overthrowing capitalism. Dalin traces the passing of the leadership of the strike movement in France from textile workers to skilled metallurgical and transport workers at the beginning of the century ( 8), presum ably permitting more sophisticated tactics. He attributes the decline in ardor in the immediate prewar period to the increasing dominance in Paris of that bete noire of Marxism, a \"labor aristocracy\" of building and light indust rial unions ( 172 ).

Lotti, La Settimana rossa, Florence, 1965. 57· Sorel became a regular contributor to the nationalist L'Independance, and a patron of the Cercle Proudhon, which (according to its leader, Edouard Berth) \"came close to creating Fascism avant la lettre\" (cited in Talman, 58 n. 15). For Sorelian influence in Italy, see R. Paris, \"Georges Sorel en Italie,\" Mouvement Social, 1965, Jan-Mar, 131-8; J. Roth, \"The Roots of Italian Fascism : Sorel and Sorelismo,\" Journal of Modern History, 1967, Mar, 30-45. A leading student of comparative fascism, E. Nolte, tends, however, to stress the influence of Nietzsche more than of Sorel in providing the non-Marxist elements of Musso lini's critique of liberal democracy : \"Marx und Nietzsche im Sozialismus des jungen Musso lini,\" Historische Zeitsc hrift, CXCI , 1960, 249- 335.

De Felice's book is by far the richest study ever made of Mussolini's political formation. His basic conclusion that Mussolini was a product of the French revolutionary tradition and of the Left evoked sto rmy criticism in Italy to which De Felice responded vigorou sly in an interview with M. Ledeen, Intervista sul fascismo, Bari, 1 975. D.

Contributo al dibattito sul fascismo. The controversy is discussed summarily in the introduct ion of C. Delzell to the English-language edition of an interpretive work first published in 1969 : De Felice, Interpretations of Fascism, Cambridge, Mass., 1977. De Felice has also traced connections between revolutionary syndicalism and the even more romantic right-wing nationalist who contributed to the growth of fascism, Gabriele D'Annunzio : Sindicalismo rivolu­ zionario e fiumanesimo nel carteggio De Ambris-D'Annunzio, r9I9-1922, Brescia, 1966.

Tilly, Century, 169 ff. 65. P. Spriano, L'Occupazione delle Fabriche, Turin, 1964, follows the latter communist line in minimizing the syndicalist influence and maximizing the innovative aspects of the Togliatti-Gramsci group. For a more balanced account see M. Clark, Antonio Gramsci and the Revol ution that Failed, New Haven/L, 1977. 66. The first title and the finally adopted title, respec tively, of the socialist cul­ tural periodical that provided the name ( Ordine Nuov o) genera lly used to describe the Gramsci-Togliatti group, which eventu ally dominated the Italian Communist party. 67. Both the word and the concept of \"hegemony\" have generated an enormous literature verging on the mystical with the advent of the era of \"Eurocommunism\" and the effort of Italian Communists in particular to differentiate themselves from Soviet Communists. The concept is discussed (though not related adequ ately to the syndicalist heritage ) in S. White, \"Gramsci and the Italian Communist Party,\" Government and Opposition, 1972, Spring, esp. 191; G. Williams, \"Gramsci's Con­ cept of 'Egemon ia,' \" Journal of the History of Ideas, 1960, Oct-Dec, 586-99; and especi ally T. Bates, \"Gramsci and the Theory of Hegemony,\" Journal of the History of Ideas, 1975, Apr- Jun, 351-66. The latter points out (352) that the concept was derived from the emphases on proletarian consent in Axelrod and Plekhanov. But Lenin and Leninists (particul arly intellectuals ) also used the term in the early Soviet period as a virtual synonym for dictatorship of the proletariat. V. Adoratsky (\"Ideia gegemonii proletariata,\" in \"Politicheskaia deiatel'nost' Lenina i ego lozungi,\" Molo daia Gvardiia, 1924, nos. 2-3, 488 ff.) places the term first among the \"slogans\" of Lenin. It has more recently been reassigned to Lenin as a rigid central concept used to refute almost all non-Soviet policies in the contemporary world, including those of Gramscian claimants to the concept (I. Aluf, \"Leninskoe uchenie o gegemonii proletariata i sovremennost',\" Voprosy Istorii KPSS, 1969, no. I, 14-29). 68. Wiskemann, 22; Finer, 101; Tilly, 187-8.

It began with votive reverence for Das Kapital without much understanding. Marx's anarchist foe, Bakunin, was the first to attempt to translate it into Russian in the late 186os. Populist foes of Marxism, Mikhailovsky and Nicholas Danielson, became in the early seventies the first Russians respectively to praise him ex­ travagantly in the legal press and to complete a translation. A liberal professor in Kiev, Nicholas Sieber, was one of the first ever to include Marx's work in a formal university course during the same 1870s. Marx himself as early as 1868 called it \"the irony of fate that the Russians with whom I have fought for 25 years\" should become \"the first foreign nation to translate Capital\" (Letters to Dr. Kugelmann, L, 1934, 77; also Billin gton, Mikhailovsky, 65-70; and A.

Plekhanov's magis terial In Defense of Materialism of I894 (L, I947 ) reconciled the iconoclastic scientism with the moralistic idealism of the Russian revolutionary tradition, by urging the new generation to move from \"mechanistic\" to \"historical\" mate rialism : an \"objective\" and \"monistic\" world view that would bridge \"the seemingly bottomless abyss\" between hard facts and high ideals ( I78, 220). Kolakowski argues (Currents, II, 329, 340) that Plekhanov \"wrote the first works which can be called manuals of Marxism\" and was the first person to use the term \"dialectical materialism\" \"to denote the whole of Marxist philosophy.\" I7. Plekhanov's close associat ion with the German movement helped him be­ come a leading figure in the Second International. He wrote its official tribute to Hegel in I8gi (reprinted in Plekhanov, Les Questions fondamentales du Marxisme, I947, I07-35 ), was formally admitted as a Marxist to the Zurich Congress in I893 (Joll, International, 72), collaborated in the German-led campaign to exclude the anarch ists, and dramatica lly shook hands with a Japanese socialist at the opening of the Amsterdam Congress in I904 when the Russo-Japanese war was raging (ibid., 106).

Pipes attributes the authorship without advancing any reasons or evidenc e: Struve. Liberal on the Left r87o-rgos, Cam­ bridge, Mass., 1970, 193). For detailed treatment of this neglected conference (which does not, however, clarify this quest ion), see articles by I. Moshinsky and E. Gurvich in Katorga i Ssylka, rg28, no. 40. Russian Social Democratic Labor party remained the official name until after the Bolshevik Revolution. The initial proletarian orientation of the Russian party (if not the introduction of the word \"labo r\") almost certa inly owes something to the Kiev Social Democrats and their remarkable leader, the locksmith Yuven aly Mel'nikov. See B. Eidel'man, \"K istorii vozniknoveniia rossiiskoi sotsial demokraticheskoi rabochei partii,\" Pro­ letarskaia Revo liutsiia, 1921, no. I, 20-65. The Kievans organized a conference of their own in Mar, 1897 (31-3), and their role at the Minsk gathering in r8g8 would be better known had not many of their members been arrested in Mar, r8g8. Mel'nikov died in r8gg, and the Kievans' collective book Rabochee delo v Rossii dis­ appeared without ever being published (49, 51). Mel'nikov, who may have been radic alized by his contact with technological students at the Kharkov colony of the St. Petersburg Technological Institute, summarized their worker-oriented economism anathema to later Leninizing historians : \"Better to lift the masses an inch than one man to the second floor.\" (2g). 59· Volin, Istoriografiia, 8-g. 6o. Za piatochok, za kipiatok. This official party account of D. Kutsentov (in Ocherki istorii Leningradskoi organizatsii KPSS. Ch.I, r8 8 3 - oktiabr ' 1917, Lenin­ grad, rg62, 51 ) draws on archival material unavailable to ordinary Soviet (let alone foreign) scholars ; but it is not precisely documented and is slanted to stress retro­ actively Lenin's leadership role and closeness to the working class. The tantalizingly fragmentary use of an unpublished memoir by V. Solodilov (in Mel'nikov, Khranitel', go ) depicts Radchenko arguing that the Russian movement should correct not just English trade unionism, but German Social Democracy as well, by fusing the class struggle of the proletariat with the political struggle against autocracy. 61. This distinction dates from Plekhanov in r8g2 (Akimov, 17). 62.

'Kritiki' v agrarnom voprose,\" no. 2-3, in Sobranie, V, 1967, 99-156 (completed just as he was finishing What Is To Be Done?). So. Lenin differentiated an \"article\" from the unfocused \"thoughts and sketches\" of bourgeois journalists. See P. Karasev, \"Iz nabliudenii nad kompozitsiei leninskikh statei,\" Problemy zhanrov v zhurnalistike, Leningrad, 1968, 5-6. When asked later, Lenin formally listed his own occupation as \"journalist\" or \"litterateur,\" the latter in its Russian form of literator being synonymous with \"ideological journalism\" since Belinsky.

Krzhizhanovsky became the founding head both of the Bolshevik Commission on Electrification ( GOEL RO) and of its successor organization, the State Planning Commission (GOSPL AN). Krasin became People's Commissar for Industry and Trade and then for Transportation. Ivan Radchenko, who had worked with Klassen to set up the first peat -burning electric power station at Noginsk in 1912 , became head of the Directorate for Peat. See Mel'nikov, \"Organizator,\" 25-6. Though in prison or exile for most of the decade leading up to his death in 19II, Stepan Radchenko made use of a brief period of amnesty during the Revolution of 1905 to supply a revolver to his brother Leonty in Moscow and to bring another brother, Yury, to Vologda to learn revolutionary technique from fellow exiles there. After Stepan's death Yury was arrested when a lengthy Marxist study by Stepan was discovered in the secret compartment of a trunk that had been auctioned off to pay his debts. That piece of writing has not survived, and the first apparatchik thus left behind no written legacy of his own. See I. Radchenko, 183-6. 87. Strange as it may seem, there is still no comprehensive, schol arly biography of Lenin. The immense Soviet scholarship on the subject provides vast information, but is utterly hagiographical and devoid of interpretive-let alone critical-treat­ ment. \"Scholarship\" on Lenin in the USSR is rather in the state of Christian scholar­ ship about Jesus before modern Biblical criticism began to ask basic textual and interpretive questions. The \"quest of the historical Lenin\" is not yet accepta ble to those who control access to the documents. A recent Western reviewer of the cur­ rent Soviet chief hagiographer sees Lenin being treated not just as a historical actor but as a figura, validating the relationship between one event and another, and representing at all times \"a goal imminent in the course of events\" (A. Kimball, \"I. I. Mints and the Representation of Reality in History,\" Slavic Review, 1976, Dec, 716).

Lenin's two most important prescriptive writin gs, with broad programmatic significance for the international movement after coming into power, were The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky (written Autumn rgr8, published L, 1920 ) and \"Left-Wing\" Communism, an Infantile Disorder (written and pub­ lished Spring 1920, first disseminated at the all-important Second Congress of the Communist International in July, 1920 ). A specia lly brilliant polemic accomplishment of his campaign in the pre-World War I period against both \"right liquidators\" (Mensheviks ) and \"left liquidators\" (Bogdanov's Bolshevik faction, which was often dominant within Russia itself) was Lenin's success in ridiculing and bracketing together the genuinely Christian and conser vative \"God-seekers\" with the anti-religious and ultra-revolutionary \"God­ builders .\" See J. Scherrer, \"'Ein gelber und ein blauer Teufel .' Zur Entstehung der Begriffe 'Bogost roitel'stvo' und 'Bogoiskatel'stvo ,' \" Forsc hungen zur osteuropiiischen Geschichte, XXV, 1978, 319-29. A further act of polemic ingenuity was Lenin's bracketing together of the Left Bolsheviks' insistence on recalling Social Democratic deputies elected to the Duma ( \"recallism,\" otzovizm ), with their insistence on building a new proletarian culture within the working class itself (\"god-building,\" bogotsroitel'st vo) into the alleged sin of \"god-recallism\" ( bozhestvenny otzovizm ). 93· Isaiah Berlin has called this an \"artificial dialectic\" of planned alternation between relaxation and terror and identified it as Stalin's special contribution to politics in the twentieth century.

Previously known as a \"strike commission\" or \"workers' committee,\" the St. Petersburg group may have been the first formally to call itself a Soviet (see L. Petrova, \"Peterburgsky sovet rabochikh deputatov,\" Voprosy Istorii, 1955, no. II, 26). The insistence of Shipulina and other Soviet sources on the paternity of Ivanovo may reflect the fact of higher Bolshevik partici­ pation. Other works that imply St. Petersburg origins are L. Kleinbort, Pervy sovet rabochikh deputatov, Petrograd, 1917; and the 1925 work of L. Gorin, referenced and critiqued in Samoilov and Shipulina. I 54· 0. Anweiler, cited in R.

The evidence in E. Smith, The Young Stalin, NY, 1967, indicates the prob­ ability of such connections-at least from the time of his mysterious survival of Okhrana raids in Tbilisi in rgor-e ven if his particular hypotheses about the extent of these connections seem unduly conjectural. Isaac Don Levine, George Kennan, and others suggested earlier a Stalin-Okhrana link; and a prominent Soviet his­ torian confirmed to me during the Khru shchev era that their findings were \"right in essence though not in detail.\" Roy Medvedev, Let History Judge: The Origins and Consequences of Stalinism, NY, 1971, 315 -24, provides a fascinating, if skepticaL discussion of these theories along with other rumors and theories within the USSR about Stalin's possible connections with the tsarist secret police. Much of his own material and his final comparison of Stalin with Azev raise doubts about his con­ clusion that \"Stalin did not serve the tsarist secret police\" ( 323); and he seems less certain in his more recent \"New Pages from the Political Biography of Stalin,\" in R. Tucker, ed., Stalinism, NY, 1977, 199-201. Tucker shows that no connection has been proven and is skeptical about Smith's argument, though ultimately non­ committal (Stalin As Revo lutionary r874-1929, NY, 1973, 108-14). 157.

Elizabeth Cady Stan­ ton, denied a seat at the former conference because of her sex, became a radical leader at the latter gathering. Its \"Declaration of Sentiment\" was modeled in part on the Declarat ion of Independence; and the journal she cofounded after the Civil War with Susan B. Anthony was called Revolution. See O'Neill, \"Feminism as a Radical Ideology,\" in A. Young, ed., Dissent: Explorations in the Histor y of Ameri­ can Radicalism, DeKalb, 1968, 279. 52. Women did play a crucial role in the social revolutionary ferment of early twentieth-centur y America. The key personalities ranged from Lucy Parsons, the widow of the only English-speaking Haymarket martyr, who appeared on the plat­ form at the founding congress of the IWW, to the emigre anarchist editor, Emma Goldman. But the leading role was played by a remarkable series of Irish women as Irish radicals turned from national to social revolution in the New World. The line of leadership ran from the mythical \"Molly Maguire,\" who lent her name to the conspiracy of the 187os, through the miners' heroine Mary (\"Mother\" ) Jones, another founding figure of the IWW who lived to be one hundred, on to Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, the companion and correspondent of Joe Hill in his last days and the \"rebel girl\" of his ballads. See the latter's I Speak My Own Piece, NY, 1955. A unique leadership role in the Irish revolutionary movement itself was played by Maude Gonne, who simultaneously inspired extremists of both Left and Right: working first with both French Boulangists and Irish republicans, later with both her revolution ary husband (John MacBride, who was a martyr of the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916) and her lifelong react ionary admirer, the poet William Butler Yeats. Recent biographies by S. Levenson (NY, 1977 ) and N. Cardozo (NY, 1978) should be substant ially supplemented for these aspects of her career by the pro­ jected study of L. O'Neill, The Gyres of Gonne: The Influence of Maude Gonne Mac­ Bride on Modern History. More militant than Gonne's \"daughters of Erin\" of 1900 was the revolutionary rival to the Boy Scouts, the \"Sons of Erin\" founded by the even more professional revolutionary Constance Markiewicz in 1gog. The daughter of Lord Gore-Booth, she married a Pole for revolutionary validation, once went direc tly to a revolutionary meeting in evening dress from Dublin castle, participated in the Easter rising of 1916, and became the first minister of labor in the first independent Irish govern­ ment-and the first woman cabinet member in Western Europe. See J. van Voris, Constance de Markievicz, Old Westbury, 1972, 39 ff., 8. Eamon de Valera retro­ spect ively noted that \"women are at once the boldest and the most unmanagea ble revolutionaries.\" Ibid., g. 53· Carlo Botta, Storia della guerra del' independenza degli Stati Uniti d'America, Paris, 1809, 4V. Her frame of reference was generally European. On her first trip to America in 1818-9, she wrote a play glorifying a Swiss revolutionary, which she believed would begin an entirely new school of drama (Altorf, a tragedy, Philadelphi a, 1819; dis­ cussed Perkins, 12-3 ). Its romantic, revolutionary message was, however, out of tune with the rising chauvinist temper of the new nation; and the play was, appro­ priate ly perhaps, replaced by Pizzaro, a melodrama of colonial conquest, on the occasion of General Andrew Jackson's triumphal visit to New York. Perkins, 36-41. Again, it was a European event-the outbreak and spread of revolution in 1830- that inspired her to predict in an American journal (Free Enquirer, 1830, Nov 27) the imminent arrival of a new society that \"no longer pitched nation against na­ tion\" by means of an altogether different form of war from \"every other struggle in which the human race has been engaged ... a war of class . . . that .. . is univers al.\" Cited in Waterman, 228; also Perkins, 305. 54· P.

He suggests that this percentage is probably lower for men. Knight's analysis ( 144-5) of the biographies of female SR terrorists during the decade Igo2- II, shows that the percentage of women from the privileged estates had declined only a little (and was demonstra bly higher than among men), and that almost all of the women were highly educated-20 of the 27 women officia lly identified with terrorist acts by the party were designated as intelligentki. 105.

Engels had scorned the nonrevolutionary efforts of Louise Otto-Peters to improve educational and professional opportunities for women; and subsequent Social Demo­ crats often echoed this attitude in assessing her \"Address of a Maiden\" to the ministers of Saxony in May 1848, and her work as editor of the first German women's newspaper, Frauen-Zeitung from 1849-52. See Zetkin, Zur Gesch ichte, 25, 46-59, who was retro actively expressing her later insistence that Social Democratic women's organizations avoid all contact with bourgeois women's movements. (See Meyer, \"Movement,\" 1 I I). Paralleling Peters's pioneering efforts (and even more neglected) was the woman's organization that coalesced in Brussels in response to the Fourierist Considerant's championing of female rights during the Revolution of 1848. Led by Desiree Veret Gay, widow of Robert Owen's original French disciple and outspoken foe of \"au­ thoritarian socia lism\" (See Dommanget, Considerant, 18g; Zetkin, 32-3 ; and Jules Gay's unjust ly forgotten major work, Le Socialisme rationnel et le socialisme au­ toritaire, Geneva, 1868 ), this group eventually formed links with the First Inter­ national. An early champion of day-care centers for children, Gay and her husband saw equality of the sexes as a major deterrent to the paternal and authoritarian tendencies developing within the socialist movement. Humane treatment of children was to be the hallmark of a new morality, and they set up the first journal expressly for children. See Gans, \"Owen a Paris,\" 45; and Desiree Gay, Education rationelle de la premiere enfance: Manuel a !'usage des jeunes meres, 1868. 107.

Important new resea rch by L. Gerson for a biography of Dzerzhinsky indicates that the first love of that Polish-Russian founder of the Soviet secret police was Julia Goldman, the Jewish sister of a founder of the Bund. Jewish women continued to play a disproportionately great role in those aspects of revolutionary activity that required dedication and risk. Almost 30 percent of the women terrorists in the SR Party were Jewish, though very few Jewish men were involved (Knight, 146). On the broader question of the role and motivation of Jews in the revolutionary tradition, see R. Wistrich, Revo lutionary Jews from Marx to Trotsky, L, 1976, which tends to stress self-hatred as the recurring motif in the variety of figures he examines, and the more balanced treatment by L.

Luxemburg believed that the natural, proletarian-rooted nature of the mass strike distinguished it from the anarchistic general strike so long caricatured by Social Democrats (\"the general strike is general nonsense\" ); and that its genesis in relatively backward Russia (\"In no country had one so little thought of 'propagating' or even 'discussing' the mass strike.\") prefigured even greater power for the mass strike in more industrialized countries. See Howard, Writings, 230, paraphrasing Luxemburg's own earlier article of 19os, Mar 3. 123. Nettl, Luxemburg, II, so4. 124. Her criticisms (related in Badia, 326 ff. and in Y. Bourdet, \"Le Marxisme anti-autoritaire de Rosa Luxemburg,\" Autogestion, 1977, Oct, so) were in fact preceded by Parvus's critique of Lenin's \"ultracentralism\" (Badia, 327 n. 306) on Nov 30, 1903. Luxemburg's classic, \"The Organizational Questions of Russian Social Democracy\" appeared in both Iskra and Die Neue Zeit in 1904, Jul, and is trans­ lated (with introduction by B. Wolfe) in R. Luxemburg, \"The Russian Revolution\" and \"Leninism or Marx ism?\", Ann Arbor, 1961, 81-108. The depth of her opposition to Leninist authoritarianism is played down by Badia, but stressed by Bourdet and particul arly by D. Guerin, Rosa Luxemb urg et la spontaneite revolutionnaire, 1966. 12s. Badia, 3S4-S n. 120. 126. Ibid., 303-4. 127. Zasu lich accused Lenin in 1904 of substituting the hierarchical concept of an \"organization\" for the mass concept of a \"party\" and condemned the Bolshevik repudiation of democracy in 1918 just before her death. See J. Bergman, \"The Political Thought of Vera Zasulich,\" Slavic Review, 1979, Jun, 243-s8. 128. Luxemburg taught at the German party school beginning in 1907 and was asked by Bogda nov and Gorky to teach at the Russian party school at Capri, which sought to produce from the proletariat \"permanent cadres of the directors of the party\" (J. Scherrer, \"Les Ecoles du parti de Capri et de Bologne : La formation de !'intelligentsia du parti,\" Cahiers du Monde Russe et Sovietique, 1978, Jul-Sep,"},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 7 261, 266). It seems likely that the Leninist tradition took over this concept of cadres within the party from Bogda nov (who saw them as bearers of a new collec­ tive consciousness and sense of \"organizing skill\" organizovannost', organizatsion­ nost' : Scherrer, 266-7 ), who in turn derived it from the German Social Democrats. As between Bogdanov's concept of a \"worker's intelligentsia\" stressing the class character and proletarian consciousness of those to be trained and Lenin's stress on a \"party intelligentsia\" more concerned with the Marxist orthodo xy of intellectuals and their consciousness of class struggle (the antipodes posed by Sherrer ), Luxem­ burg was closer to the latter. In general, Badia suggests that the relationship be­ tween Lenin and Luxemburg was that of \"privileged adversaries\" rather than principled opponents : 325. 129.

Badia, 796-7. I37· Already in her last major article on the mass strike (in Leipziger Volks­ zeitung, 1913, Jun 26, 27, 28), Luxemburg noted that the German proletariat, despite its incomparable organization, was almost unique in never having produced-and not yet even being ripe for-a mass strike ; and her invocation to struggle \"whether ending in victory or defeat\" clearly implies her belief in the latter result. See Textes, 160, 169. 138. \"If one had to charact erize the principal activity of Rosa Luxemburg in a word-not simply her profession but her vocation-one would have to say that she was first and above all else a journalist and more precisely a political journalist.\" Badia, 593, and the excellent analytical section, \"La Journaliste,\" 593-643. 139· Luxemburg, Briefe aus dem Gafiingnes, 1920, 17-8; and discussion of this passage from her posthumously published correspondence in Badia, esp. 712-3. 140.
