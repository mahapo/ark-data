Slow Death in U.S. Gas Chambers On June 15, 1994, dramatic events unfolded during the execution of capital punishment. David Lawson, sentenced to death for a capital felony, was scheduled to be killed by hydrogen cyanide in the gas chamber located in the state prison of Raleigh, North Carolina—but the prisoner refused to assist his executioners. 1 Lawson repeatedly held his breath for as long as possible and took only short breaths in be- tween. 2 Lawson exhibited enormous willpower, calling out to both executioners and witnesses throughout his execution:   1 A detailed description of this execu tion can be found at: Bill Krueger, “ Lawson’s Final Mo- ments ”, The News & Observer , Raleigh, North Carolina, June 19, 1994, p. A1. 2 Newsweek , November 8, 1993, p. 75; The New York Times , October 6, 1994, p.

He was declared dead only after eighteen minutes. The witnesses to the execution were horrified. The warden of the prison who had also supervised the execution was so shaken that he resigned. B ecause of this execution fiasco, execu- tions with poison gas have been abandoned for a short period of time in the USA and replaced with lethal injections. In early March 1999, however, this horror had already been for- gotten. This time, the victim was a German national. Despite interven- tion by the German government, Walter LaGrand was executed in the state prison at Florence, Arizona. LaGrand’s death struggle against lethal cyanide gas lasted eighteen minutes. Thirty witnesses peered through a bulletproof window as the confessed, convicted murderer died horribly behind an armor-reinforced door. 3 It is now clear to the experts, and especially to those still waiting on death row, that a quick and painless execution by gas requires the cooperation of the intended victim. Pr isoners about to be gassed were usually encouraged to inhale d eeply as soon as the cyanide was re- leased in order to make their deaths come easily. However, if an in- tended victim was uncooperative, the execution could easily become a fiasco. By simply refusing to take th e deep breaths needed to quickly ingest a lethal dose of cyanide, the agony could last for more than eighteen minutes, even under ideal conditions. Publications in the United States reveal that executions lasting from 10 to 14 minutes are the rule, rather than the exception. Amnesty International calls them “ botched executions ”. 4-7   June 16, 1994, p.

P RELUDE 13 The method used in American ex ecution gas chambers was intro- duced in 1924, and has since been improved to technical perfection. The expense to kill just one single person is tremendously high, since neither the witnesses, nor the prison personnel or the environment may be endangered by the poison gas released for such an execution. Re- inforced-glass windows, massive, h eavy, hermetically-sealed steel doors, powerful ventilation systems with a device to burn the evacu- ated poisonous gases, and a chemical treatment of the chamber interior to neutralize all remaining traces of the poison make this execution method the most a cumbersome of all. 8 During the last two decades of the 20 th century, the only technical expert in the United States able to build and maintain this equipment was Frederick A. Leuchter Jr., sometimes referred to in the media as “ Mr. Death ”, 9 since his profession was the design, construction and maintenance of various kinds of execution devices. 10 A feature article in The Atlantic Monthly (Feb. 1990), for example, factually described Leuchter as “the nation’s only commercial s upplier of execution equipment. [...] A trained and accomplished engineer, he is versed in all types of execu- tion equipment. He makes lethal-injection machines, gas chambers, and gallows, as well as electrocution systems [...] ” Similarly, a lengthy New York Times article (October 13, 1990), complete with a front-page photo of Leuchter, called him “The nation’s leading adviser on capital punishment.” In his book about “ America’s Capital Punishment Industry ”, Ste-   selbstassistierte Holocaust-Schwindel ”, Vierteljahreshefte für freie Geschichtsforschung , 1(1) (1997), pp. 6ff. (onlin e: www.vho.org/VffG/1997/1/ Grieb1.html) (subsequently abbreviated as VffG ). 8 Re. the technical proceedings cf.: F. A. Leuchter, The Third Leuchter Report , Samisdat Pub- lishers Ltd., Toronto 1989 (online: www.zundelsite.org/english/leuchter /report3/leuchter3.toc.html). 9 Such is the title of a documentary movie direct ed by Errol Morris about Fred Leuchter, shown at the Sundance Film Festivals in Park City (Utah, USA) in late January 1999: “ Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr. ” There are actually several versions of this movie, the one offered as a VHS video for retail being massively reworked. 10 The following paragraphs were taken from Mark Weber, “ Probing Look at ‘Capital Punish- ment Industry’ Affirms Expertise of Auschwitz Investigator Leuchter ”, The Journal of Histori- cal Review 17(2) (1998), pp. 34ff.

His products include electric chairs, gas chambers, gallows, and lethal injec- tion machines. He offers design, construction, installation, staff training and maintenance.” Killing someone in a gas chamber is very dangerous for those who carry out the execution, above all because the body of the dead pris- oner is saturated with lethal gas. After the execution, explains Leuchter: 12 “You go in. The inmate has to be completely washed down with chlorine bleach or with ammonia. The poison exudes right out through his skin. And if you gave the body to an undertaker, you’d kill the under- taker. You’ve got to go in, you’ve got to completely wash the body.” Bill Armontrout, warden of the Missouri State Penitentiary in Jef- ferson City, confirms the danger: 13 “One of the things that cyanide gas does, it goes in the pores of your skin. You hose the body down, see. You have to use rubber gloves, and you hose the body down to decontaminate it before you do anything [else] ” In Leuchter’s opinion, gas chamber use should be discontinued, not just because of the cruelty of this method of execution, but because of his beliefs relating to gas chambers as such: 14 “They’re dangerous. They’re dangerous to the people who have to use them, and they’re dangerous for the witnesses. They ought to take all of them and cut them in half with a chain saw and get rid of them.” With a career built on the motto “ Capital punishment, not capital torture ”, Leuchter takes pride in his work . He is glad to be able to en- sure that condemned prisoners die painlessly, that the personnel who carry out executions are not endangere d, and that taxpayer dollars are saved.   11 Stephen Trombley, op. cit.

Hydrogen Cyanide—a Dangerous Poison Hydrogen cyanide, is not, of course, utilized solely for the purpose of executions in American gas chambers, but for much more construc- tive purposes as well. Since approximately the end of WWI, hydrogen cyanide, or HCN, has been used to exterminate vermin such as bed- bugs, lice, corn weevils, termites, cockroaches, and other pests. It is, of course, important to be extremely cautious while applying hydrogen cyanide in order to avoid disaster, because it is in many ways a highly dangerous poison. The residents of a house in Los Angeles, California, had to learn this in a quite painful way shortly before Christmas 1947. They had hired the Guarantee Fumigation Co mpany to destroy the termites which threatened to eat up the woode n structure. The pest controllers, however, were apparently not very competent, because when using a container of pressurized HCN to fill the house, which had been wrapped up like a Christmas present, they exceeded safe limits and Fig. 2: How to get rid of termites: Larger photo: Before. Smaller photo: After."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 16 pumped in too much gas. (Fig. 2). 15 Due to unknown reasons, the mix- ture of air and HCN, which can be highly explosive under certain cir- cumstances, ignited during the fumigation. The resulting explosion destroyed the entire dwelling. 16 However, hydrogen cyanide has yet another insidious characteris- tic: it is highly mobile. This mobility is highly welcome when it comes to killing vermin: Wherever fleas and bugs try to hide, the gas will still reach them! Unfortunately, hydrogen cyanide does not restrict itself to attack vermin. Rather, it indiscrimin ately seeps into the smallest cracks and even penetrates porous substances such as felt sealing materials and thin walls, thereby leaking into areas where it is not welcome. The failure on the part of disinfestors to ensure that all places to be fumi- gated are adequately sealed off have been described in toxicological literature: 17 “Example : J.M., a 21 year old female home decorator, was work- ing in the cellar of the house, the second floor of which was being treated for vermin with cyanide gas. Due to insufficient sealing during fumiga- tion, the gas penetrated the corridors, where it poisoned the disinfestor, and reached the cellar through air shafts. Mrs. M. suddenly experienced an intense itching sensation in her throat followed by headache and diz- ziness. Her two fellow workers noticed the same symptoms and they all left the cellar. After half an hour, Mrs. M. returned to the cellar where- upon she suddenly collapsed and fell unconscious. Mrs. M. was taken to a hospital together with the unconscious exterminator. Mrs. M. recov- ered and was released. The exterminator, by contrast, was pronounced dead on arrival.” But the dangers of this type of poison gas are not merely restricted to persons in the same house in which fumigation is taking place. Large quantities of gas may penetrate the open air and endanger the entire neighborhood, as shown by an accident in the fall of 1995 in a Croatian holiday resort: 18   15 A gassing requires 1-2% by volume, while an e xplosion requires 6% by volume or more; see, in this regard, chapter 6.3. 16 “ How to get rid of termites ”, Life , Dec. 22, 1947, p. 31; see also Liberty Bell , 12/1994, pp. 36f. 17 S. Moeschlin, Klinik und Therapie der Vergiftung , Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1986, p. 300. 18 dpa, “ Dilettantische Kammerjäger ”, Kreiszeitung, Böblinger Bote , Nov. 16, 1995, p. 7. Re- search has failed to determine which toxic gas was involved. Since hydrogen cyanide is one of the most poisonous and most rapidly diffusing of all gases used in disinfestation, the reported damage would have been at least as great if caused by hydrogen cyanide, even if hydrogen cyanide was not in fact involved in this acci dent. A number of additional examples are de-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"1. P RELUDE 17 “That failed profoundly. Three local residents suffering from symp- toms of poisoning and a number of surviving woodworms were the re- sults of the botched action against vermin in a church in the Croatian holiday resort Lovran, close to Rij eka. The exterminator’s clumsy work necessitated the evacuation of several hundred residents of the locality. The exterminators tried to treat the Church of the Holy Juraj for woodworm during the night, using the highly toxic gas. But since they failed to seal off the church appropriately, the gas seeped into surround- ing houses in which people were alre ady asleep. ‘Fortunately, the people woke up immediately because of sudden attacks of nausea—that’s what saved them from certain death,’ wr ote the newspaper, ‘Vecernji List’. Three residents nevertheless suffered severe intoxication. The mayor de- cided to evacuate the center of th e town. The exterminators were ar- rested. The woodworms survived. dpa” But that is still not all: on top of this, hydrogen cyanide is also a tenacious poison. It adheres wherever it is utilized, especially in a moist environment. Deadly cyanide gas continues to evaporate slowly from moist objects for hours and days, involving a permanent envi- ronmental hazard where sufficient ventilation cannot be assured. This is emphasized by an especially dramatic and simultaneously macabre accident in the United States in the fall of 1998: Oct. 10, 1998 Suicide fumes sicken nine Iowa students GRINNELL, Iowa (CPX) A student at Grinnell College committed suicide by swallowing so much potassium cyanide that the fumes from his body sickened nine people. Two college staff members, three students and four para- medics were weakened and nausea ted by the fumes after en- counterin g the student’s bod y Monda y . The y were treated and   scribed by K. Naumann: “ Die Blausäurevergiftung bei der Schädlingsbekämpfung ”, Zeitschrift für hygienische Zoologie und Schädlingsbekämpfung , 1941, pp. 36-45."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 18 released from a local hospital. Carl T. Grimm, 20, a sophomore from Placentia, Calif., swallowed a crystalline form of potassium cyanide, which pre- vents oxygen from entering cells. He immediately asked his roommate to call for help but not before the chemical reacted with water in his body and began to produce cyanide gas, a spokesman for the college said. Grimm’s residence hall at the private liberal arts college located about 50 miles east of Des Moines was evacuated be- cause of the fumes. Grinnell Regional Medical Center, where Grimm’s body was taken, also had to be aired out. College officials are still trying to determine how Grimm got the potassium cyanide and why he wanted to kill himself. [19] Another case, which occurred somewhat differently, nevertheless led to an accident which was no less tragic. Salts of cyanide, which release cyanide gas in the presence of moisture, are used for the separation of gold and silver during the processing of precious metals. In the case in question, a company was engaged in the processing of the cyanide-rich residues of such ch emical reactions contained in large tanks, which is not without risk. The employer directed the workers, who were not equipped with gas masks or protective clothing, to go into the tanks which were still releasing cyanide gas. The conse- quences were tragic. Department of Justice National News Release MONDAY, MAY 10, 1999 On May 7, the jury in Pocatello, ID, found that Allan Elias ordered employees of Evergreen Resources, a fertilizer manu- facturing company he owned, to enter and clean out a 25,000- gallon storage tank containing cyanide without taking required precautions to protect his employees.

Scott Dominguez, an Everg reen Resources employee, was overcome by hydrogen cyanide gas while cleaning the tank and sustained permanent brain damage as a result of cyanide poi- soning.[...] Over a period of two days in August 1996, Elias directed his employees—wearing only jeans and T-shirts—to enter an 11-foot-high, 36-foot-long storage tank and clean out cyanide waste from a mining operation he owned. Elias did not first test the material inside the tank for its toxicity, nor did he deter- mine the amount of toxic gases present. After the first day of working inside the tank, severa l employees met with Elias and told him that working in the tank was giving them sore throats, which is an early symptom of exposure to hydrogen cyanide gas. The employees asked Elias to test the air in the tank for toxic gases and bring them protective gear—which is required by OSHA and which was available to the defendant free of charge in this case. Elias did not provide the protective gear, and he ordered the employees to go back into the tank, falsely assuring them that he would get them the equipment they sought. Later that morning, Do minguez collapsed inside the tank. And he could not be rescued for nearly an hour because Elias also had not given employees the required rescue equip- ment.

This was proven by a dramatic accident in 1995 in a cave in the French city of Montérolier: 21 “The death of nine persons on June 21, 1995, in the cave of Montérolier (Seine-Maritime) was said to have been caused by the re- lease of cyanide gas originating from the poison gas used during First World War, the so-called Vincennite. This was announced Wednesday by former Professor of Physical Chemistry, Louis Soulié. [...] At a press conference in Buchy, he said that ‘neither the children nor the firemen rushing to the rescue—one of whom wore a gas mask—died of carbon monoxide poisoning.’ [...] ‘Even six days after their deaths, a cyanide concentration twice as high as the fatal dose was still observed in the victims’ blood.’ According to the professor’s remarks, the three children lit a fire in the cave and threw a Vincennite bomb found in the cave into the fire. The bomb exploded. The gas caused the deaths of three children, four fire- men, the father of one of the children and an amateur spelunker. According to Prof. Soulié, the deaths of the firemen looking for the children in the cave, including the fireman wearing a gas mask, were due to the fact that hydrogen cyanide dissolves in the sweat and penetrates the body through the skin, where it causes poisoning.” 1.3. The Acid that Causes Blue Stains Great excitement was caused by a strange occur- rence in a Protestant church at Wiesenfeld, Lower Bavaria, Germany, in the spring and summer of 1977.

The experts having renovated the church were now called in for consul- tation, and found themselves confronted by a riddle which was only solved by a chemical analysis of the stained por- tions of the walls. The entire interior surface of the church was impregnated by Iron Blue. No explanation could be found for this in the literature. It nevertheless proved possi- ble to reconstruct the se- quence of events. A few weeks after the re- plastering of the church with a water-resistant cement mortar, the entire church had been fumigated with Zyklon B (hy- drogen cyanide) to extermi- nate woodworm in the choir stalls. The hydrogen cyanide, released by the Zyklon B, did not just kill woodworm: it also reacted chemically with the plaster. The hydrogen cyanide con- tained in the Zyklon reacted with the iron oxides contained in quanti- ties of 1-2% in all plasters, thus forming Iron Blue, a highly stable compound well-know for centuries. 22 Reports of blue pigmentation of walls resulting from fumigation with hydrogen cyanide for the destruction of vermin in areas with   22 G.

In other cases, there was also damage to the structure and interior installations, but no blue stains, perhaps because the plas- ter was old and had already set. 24   23 E. Emmerling, in: M.

Whether the examples cited in the paper may perhaps refer to the above mentioned case only in a roundabout way, must remain open for the time being. Carl Hermann Christmann reports the case of a farm building belonging to an 18 th century monastery; the fa rm building was sold to a farmer following secularization, and the farm er then used it as a barn. Approximately 20 years ago, an investor converted the beautiful Baroque building into a luxury holiday restau- rant. The existing interior plaster was repaired and painted white. After some time, blue stains appeared in the white pa int; the stains were identified by a consulting expert as Iron Blue. The expert assumed that the former owner must have fumigated the building with hydrogen cya- nide between 1920 and 1940, which then caused the stains 40-50 years later.

Fred Leuchter on Auschwitz and Majdanek On February 3, 1988, Fred Leuchter received an unexpected visi- tor at his home in Boston, Massachusetts. A professor of French, Greek, Latin, as well as critic of testimonies, texts and documents from the University of Lyon II—Dr. Robert Faurisson—had an unusual as- signment in mind: He wanted to persuade Leuchter, in his capacity as an expert in execution technology, to prepare a professional opinion to be used in a criminal trial then taking place in Toronto, Canada. 25 More precisely, Dr. Faurisson wanted to convince Leuchter to determine whether or not the generally allege d mass exterminations with hydro- gen cyanide gas in the concentration camps of the Third Reich were technically possible. Until that time, Leuchter had never questioned the existence of German homicidal gas chambers. When Prof. Faurisson showed him some mostly technical documents, however, Leuchter be- gan to have doubts about the technical feasibility of the alleged homi- cidal gassings and agreed to come to Toronto to view additional docu- mentation. After this meeting and on the assignment of defense counsel, he then traveled to Poland with his wi fe who was also his secretary, his draftsman, a video cameraman and a translator, to make a technical examination of the concentration camps at Auschwitz, Auschwitz- Birkenau and Majdanek for the above trial. He returned to the United States and wrote a 192-page report (incl. appendices). He also brought 32 test samples taken from the masonry in the crematoria at Auschwitz and Birkenau, the locations where th e alleged gassings are said to have taken place, as well as from a delousing gas chamber. The background of these samples is as follows:   25 Re. background and course of the crim inal proceedings cf.: R.

Vari- ous methods were used to accomplish this objective: hot air, hot steam, several different poison gases, and towards the end of the war even microwaves. Delousing was urgently needed in particular because lice carry epidemic typhus, a disease with a history of repeated outbreaks in eastern and central Europe. Epidemic typhus appeared again during WWII where it claimed hundreds of thousands of victims, not only in the concentration camps and prisoner-of-war camps, but among sol- diers at the front. Since WWI, the most effective and the most widely used means for the extermination of lice and other pests, was hydrogen cyanide, marketed under the trade-name Zyklon B .

T HE C OUP 25 It has been known for decades that the walls within the buildings in which Zyklon B is proved to have been used to delouse inmate clothing exhibit massive, blotchy, bluish discoloration. This blue dis- coloration is due to a chemical substance known as Iron Blue which, under the right conditions, is formed in a chemical reaction by hydro- gen cyanide with certain components of masonry. This substance can still be observed in surviving delous ing facilities today. It is obviously a very stable compound. Professor Faurisson was the first person to point out that this blue discoloration is absent from the supposed homi- cidal gas chambers at Auschwitz. Faurisson’s idea was to analyze samples from the masonry in the alleged homicidal gas chambers for traces of poison gas or its compounds (cyanides) and compare them with samples taken from the delousing chambers. Fred Leuchter fol- lowed this suggestion when doing his on-site investigations in Ausch- witz in 1988. On April 20 and 21, 1988, Leuchter took the stand as an expert witness in the courtroom in Toronto. He reported about his research and developed his conclu- sions. The atmosphere in the courtroom was tense. Leu- chter’s testimony was straight- forward and at the same time sensational: According to Leuchter, there had never been any possibility of mass extermination of human be- ings by gassing in Auschwitz, nor in Birkenau, nor in Ma- jdanek: 26 “It is the best engineer- ing opinion of this author that the alleged gas cham- bers at the inspected sites could not have then been, or now, be utilized or seriously considered to function as   26 F.

It was Armontrout who, on request of defense attorney Barbara Kulaszka, pointed out that no one in the United States under- stood the operation of gas chambers better than Fred A. Leuchter. Armontrout himself confirmed in Court the great difficulties involved in killing people with poison gas, as Robert Faurisson had done before him. Following Leuchter, Prof. James Roth, director of a chemical laboratory in Massachusetts, also t ook the witness stand to describe the results of his analysis of the 32 masonry samples, the origins of which had been unknown to him: All samples taken from the gas chambers supposedly used for mass human extermination exhibited either no or only negligible traces of cyanide, while the sample from the delousing chambers taken for use as control purposes exhibited enormously high cyanide concentrations. 27 Leuchter’s report and subsequent testimony shook the foundations of Holocaust history, the story of the ‘Nazi gas chambers’. Considering the tens of thousands of copies of this “ Leuchter Report ” that have been distributed in all major languages all over the world and the many speeches Leuchter held, the impact of the work of this one man was enormous. 2.2. Damage Control Alarmed by this development, the ‘Never Forgive, Never Forget’ brigade wasted no time in taking counter-measures. Self-styled ‘Nazi hunter’ Beate Klarsfeld announced that Fred Leuchter “ has to under- stand that in denying the Holoc aust, he cannot remain unpunished. ” 28 Jewish organizations launched a vicious smear campaign to de- stroy not only his reputation, but his ability to make a living. Leading the charge was Shelly Shapiro and her group, “ Holocaust Survivors   27 Partially derived from Prof. Faurisson’s description in: “ Zum Zündel-Prozeß in Toronto, Teil 2.

Calling Leuchter a fraud and impos- tor, this group claimed, despite be tter knowledge, that he lacked quali- fications as an execution equipment specialist and had asserted the possession of professional qualificati ons which he had never earned. 29 Although these accusations were entirely unfounded and failed to survive any legal verification, the ‘get Leuchter’ campaign, with the co-operation of mainstream journalists and editors, was successful. Leuchter’s contracts with state authorities for the manufacture, installa- tion, and servicing of execution hardware were cancelled. He was fi- nancially forced out of his home in Massachusetts and had to find pri- vate work elsewhere. No American has suffered more for his defiance of the Holocaust lobby.   29 Cf.

The Origins Before the publication of the Leuchter Report , discussion relating to the reliability of eyewitness testimony of National Socialist mass murder was confined to groups describing themselves as ‘revisionists’, usually termed ‘Neo-Nazis’ or ‘right-wing extremists’ by the media. But in fact, the labels used by the media were wide off the mark, as can be seen in the case of four of the most well-known revisionists: Paul Rassinier, French Socialist and former member of the French Resis- tance, who was an inmate of the concentration camps Buchenwald and Dora-Mittelbau; 30 German Jew, Josef Ginsburg, who suffered from anti-Jewish measures taken dur- ing WWII by other countries as well as Germany. 31 The two most notable revisionists, Professors Arthur R. Butz, USA, 32 and re- tired Prof. Robert Faurisson, of France, can certainly not be ac- cused of being political extrem- ists, and nobody ever seriously tried to do this. 33 The discussion on the tech- nical problems of the National Socialist mass-murder of the Jews was begun in the late 1970s   30 Cf. his four most-important works: Die Lüge des Odysseus , K.-H.

He began to question the standard historical version of the Holocaust after he had made numerous critical studies concerning wit- ness testimony and on documents that supposedly supported the claims of mass-murder. In 1978 for the first time, he advanced the argument that “ there had not been one single gas chamber under Adolf Hitler ”. 34 Later he supported this claim with physical, chemical, topographic, architectural, documentary, and historical arguments. He described the existence of the homicidal gas chambers as “ radically impossible ”. 35 At the end of 1979, the largest French daily newspaper, Le Monde, de- cided to publish Professor Faurisson’s provocative thesis, so he was given the opportunity to summarize it in an article. 36 The establishment historians reaction was characteristic 37 and is best illustrated by a pas- sage from a declaration signed by Pierre Vidal Naquet and 33 other researchers: 38 “One may not ask how such a mass-murder [of Jews] was possible. It was technically possible, because it happened. This is the obligatory starting-point of every hist orical investigation of this subject. We simply want to call into memory this truth: There is no debate over the existence of the gas chambers, and there must not be one.” Such a dogmatic explanation is e quivalent to a capitulation, which was well understood.

This book also repeats the mistake often emphasized by revi- sionists: quotations from ‘eye-witness’ testimony and passages from documents were taken out of context and pasted uncritically into a pre- determined historical schema.

Since the present dis- cussion contains neither a moral, nor political, evaluation of a long-dead re- gime, I shall make no moral or political statements. Personally, I am inclined to judge a politician, or political system, on the basis of what he, or it, was able to leave behind for their respective population—everything else follows. That must suffice at this point. To everyone who has ever sus- pected that revisionists are motivated by a desire to whitewash National Social- ism, or restore the acceptability of right- wing political systems, or assist in a breakthrough of Nationalism, I would like to say the following: While researching, our highest goal must at all times be to discover how historical events actually occurred—as the 19 th century German historian Leopold Ranke maintained. Histori- ans should not place research in the service of making criminal accusa- tions against, for example, Genghis Khan and the Mongol hordes, nor to whitewash any of their wrong-doings. Anybody insisting that re- search be barred from exonerating Genghis Khan of criminal accusa- tions would be the object of ridicule and would be subject to the suspi- cion that he was, in fact, acting out of political motives. If this were not so, why would anyone insist that our historical view of Genghis Khan forever be defined solely by Khan’s victims and enemies? The same reasoning applies to Hitler and the Third Reich. Both revisionists and their adversaries are entitled to their political views. The accusation that revisionists are only interested in exonerating Na- tional Socialism and that such an effo rt is reprehensible or even crimi- nal, is a boomerang: This accusation implies that it is deemed unac- ceptable to partially exonerate Nati onal Socialism historically, and by   71 The Globe and Mail , Sept. 18, 1989, Le Monde , Sept. 19, 1989, Sunday Telegraph , Sept. 24, 1989; see also “ Revisionist Historian Suffers Savage Beating ” (co- doh.com/thoughtcrimes/8909FAUR.HTML).

But by declaring any hypothetical exon- eration based on possible facts as unacceptable, one admits openly not to be interested in the quest for th e truth, but in incriminating National Socialism historically and morally under any circumstances and at all costs. And the motivation behind this can only be political. Hence, those accusing revisionists of misusing their research for political ends have themselves been proven guilty of exactly this offense. It is there- fore not necessarily the revisionists who are guided by political mo- tives—though quite a few of them certainly are—but with absolute certainty all those who accuse others of attempting to somehow his- torically exonerate a political system which has long since disappeared. As a consequence, our research must never be concerned with the possible ‘moral’ spin-off effects of our findings in relation to politi- cians or regimes of the past, but solely with the facts.

A Brief History of Forensic Examina- tions of Auschwitz 4.1. Introduction In late spring 1993, the Max-Planck-Institute for Solid State Re- search in Stuttgart issued an inte rnal memorandum informing its em- ployees that a doctoral candidate there—the author of this book—had been dismissed because of private research he had done on Auschwitz. The institute explained that in view of the horror of the National So- cialists’ crimes against the Jews, it was morally repugnant to discuss the specific manner, in which the vic tims had been killed, or to try to determine the precise number of the dead. That one of the world’s leading scientific research institutes st ated to its personnel that to de- termine accurate quantities is not only unethical, but reprehensible, and cause for dismissal, is not without its own irony. However, many peo- ple are deeply moved by the question whether or not the monstrous crime alleged should be subject to careful scrutiny by means of thor- ough forensic analysis. The following a ttempts to answer this question and offers a brief overview on forens ic examinations of the purported crimes scenes at Auschwitz which have been conducted thus far. 4.2. The Moral Obligation of Forensic Examination Does it really matter how many Jews lost their lives in the German sphere of influence during the Sec ond World War? Is it so important, after so many years, to attempt painstakingly to investigate just how they died? After all, it is surely morally correct that even one victim is one too many; and nobody seriously denies that many Jews died. To affirm these things, however, is not to raise a valid objection— moral or otherwise—to the scientific investigation of a crime held to be unique and unparalleled in the history of mankind. Even a crime that is alleged to be uniquely reprehensible must be open to a proce- dure that is standard for any other crime: namely, that it can be—must be—subject to a detailed material i nvestigation. Further: whoever pos-"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 40 tulates that a crime, alleged or actual, is unique must be prepared for a uniquely thorough investigation of th e alleged crime before its unique- ness is accepted as fact. If, on the other hand, someone sought to shield so allegedly unpar- alleled a crime from investigation by erecting a taboo of moral outrage, the creators of that taboo would, at least morally, themselves commit a singular offense: imputing unparalle led guilt, beyond any critique and defense, in this case to an entire people, the Germans. To demonstrate just what kind of double standard is being applied to ‘the Holocaust’ (generally defined as the purposeful annihilation, chiefly by gassing, of millions of Jews by the National Socialists), let us note the international reaction to several recent examples of mass murder or ‘crimes against humanity.’ In 1949, a trial started in southwest France which caused as much attention in France as did the Nuremberg War Crimes Trial: Mdm. Marie Besnard was accused of having murdered twelve people with arsenic. During this extraordinary court battle, 15 experts on medical, chemical, geological and analytical forensic experts made exhaustive analyses and long-lasting, extensive experiments with the aim to verify whether the arsenic traces found in the buried victims stemmed from poison or are the result of yet unknown concentration processes in bur- ied corpses. Finally, after twelve years of research and arguing of the fifteen experts, of which eight were professors and one even a Nobel Price laureate, Mdm. Besnard was acquitted due to lack of evidence. 72 After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, numerous mass graves, containing altogether hundreds of thousands of bodies of vic- tims of the Soviets, were discovered, excavated, and investigated. Not only was the number of victims determined, but in many cases the spe- cific cause of death as well. In the same regions where many of these mass graves were found, one million Jews are said to have been shot by the Einsatzgruppen : yet no such grave has ever been reported found, let alone dug and investigated, in the more than half a century during which these areas have been controlled by the USSR and its successor states. During the conflict in Kosovo in 1999, rumors about mass killings by Serbs spread around the world. After the fighting was over, an in-   72 Michael D. Kelleher, C. L.

A B RIEF H ISTORY OF F ORENSIC E XAMINATIONS OF A USCHWITZ 41 ternational forensic commission arrived in Kosovo, searching, excavat- ing, and forensically investigating mass graves. These graves proved to be not only fewer than the Serbs’ Albanian opponents had alleged, but to contain small fractions of the number of victims claimed. Did the Allies attempt, during the Second World War and in the years immediately following, to find and to investigate mass graves of persons said to have been victims of the Germans? So far as is known, only once: at Katyn. But the findings of the Soviet forensic commis- sion, which blamed the mass murder of several thousand Polish offi- cers buried there on the Germans, are today generally considered a fab- rication. The report of the interna tional forensic commission invited by the Germans in 1943, on the other hand, which found that the Soviets had carried out this mass murder, is today considered accurate even by the Russian government. 73 4.3. A Definition of Forensic Science Forensic science is generally regarded as a supporting science of criminology. Its aim is to collect and to identify physical remnants of a crime, and from these to draw conclusions about the victim(s), the per- petrator(s), the weapon(s), time and location of the crime as well as how it was committed, if at all. This science is relatively new and en- tered the court rooms only in 1902, when fingerprint evidence was ac- cepted, in an English court, for the first time. The 1998 CD-ROM En- cyclopedia Britannica writes about forensic science: “A broad range of scientific techni ques is available to law enforce- ment agencies attempting to identify suspects or to establish beyond doubt the connection between a suspect and the crime in question. Ex- amples include the analysis of bloodstains and traces of other body fluids (such as semen or spittle) that may indicate some of the characteristics of the offender. Fibres can be analyzed by microscopy or chemical analysis to show, for instance, that fibres found on the victim or at the scene of the crime are similar to those in the clothing of the suspect. Hair samples, and particularly skin cells attached to hair roots, can be compared chemically and genetically to those of the suspect. Many inorganic sub- stances, such as glass, paper, and paint, can yield considerable informa- tion under microscopic or chemical analysis. Examination of a document   73 Cf. F. Kadell, Die Katyn Lüge , Herbig, Munich 1991."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 42 in question may reveal it to be a fo rgery, on the evidence that the paper on which it is written was manufactured by a technique not available at the time to which it allegedly dates. The refractive index of even small particles of glass may be measured to show that a given item or fragment of glass was part of a particular batch manufactured at a particular time and place.” Hence, forensic research is exactly what revisionists, starting with Robert Faurisson, have called the search for material evidence. The revisionists’ demand for such material evidence is entirely consistent with the normal practice of modern law enforcement. Also, as is gen- erally acknowledged, forensic eviden ce is more conclusive than eye- witness testimony or documentary evidence. Even though forensic methods have hardly been applied with re- gards to Auschwitz, there are a few examples which I shall discuss briefly in the following chapter. 4.4. Forensic Science and Auschwitz 4.4.1. Forensics in the Courts 4.4.1.1. The 1946 Cracow Auschwitz Trial The 1946 Cracow Auschwitz Trial. In 1945, the Jan Sehn Institute for Forensic Research (Instytut Ekspertyz Sadowych) prepared a report on a forensic investigation of Auschwitz that was submitted in evi- dence in the 1946 Auschwitz trial in Cracow, Poland. 74 This expert report should be treated with caution, because forensic examinations and judicial procedures under the Communists have been anything but trustworthy, and in 1945, Poland was a Stalinist satellite. One need only point to the example of Katyn, the Soviet account of which was fully endorsed by Poland’s Communist regime. 73 The Cracow forensic investigators took hair, presumably cut from inmates, and hair clasps from bags found by the Soviets in Auschwitz. Tested for cyanide residues, both hair and clasps showed positive re- sults. Additionally, a zinc-plated metal cover was tested for cyanide and found to have a positive result as well.

A B RIEF H ISTORY OF F ORENSIC E XAMINATIONS OF A USCHWITZ 43 posed homicidal gas chamber at Birkenau. The tests conducted by the institu te were qualitative, not quantita- tive, analyses. In other words, they could only determine whether or not cyanide was present, not how much of it was there. As to whether or not homicidal gassing with hydrogen cyanide took place in Ausch- witz, these analyses are worthless, for three reasons: 1. There is no way of determining the origin and history of the hair and hair clasps obtained from bags in Auschwitz. Assuming that the analytic results are correct, fro m a chemical point of view the following can be noted: A positive test for cyanide in human hair proves only that the hair has been exposed to HCN (hydrogen cyanide). But that result does not suffice to establish that the per- sons from whom the hair came were killed by cyanide. It is a good deal more likely that the hair ha d already been cut when it was ex- posed to the gas: in German as well as in Allied camps, it was standard to cut off prisoners’ hair for hygienic reasons. When hair over a certain length was later reused, 75 it had to be deloused be- forehand (often with Zyklon B, the active ingredient of which is hydrogen cyanide). Hence, positive cyanide results from loose hair do not prove human gassings. 2. We face a similar problem with the zinc-plated covers allegedly used to cover the ventilation ducts of the supposed gas chambers: their exact origin and history is unknown. It would have been much preferable for the Cracow Institute to have analyzed samples from the walls of the alleged gas chambers instead of obtaining samples from pieces of metal: a. Whereas the origin and history of these metal covers was uncer- tain, the origin and (at least partly) the history of the walls of the morgues allegedly used as gas chambers was known. b. In contrast to cement and c oncrete, zinc-plated metal covers prevent the formation of stable iron cyanide compounds. 76 The developing zinc cyanide compounds are relatively unstable and must be expected to vanish in a short period of time. 77   75 Letter from the SS-Wirtschafts- und Verwalt ungshauptamt, Oranienburg, to concentration camp commanders, August 6, 1942, IMT Document 511-USSR, cited in: Der Prozeß gegen die Hauptkriegsverbrecher vor dem Internationalen Militärgerichtshof (Nuremberg, 1949), pp. 553f.

As a matter of fact, the letter accompanying the samples sent to the Cracow Institute actually mentions that a mortar sample al- legedly taken from a so-called gas chamber is enclosed as well and should also be tested for cyanide.

The 1964-1966 Fra nkfurt Auschwitz Trial Several expert reports were prep ared during the Frankfurt Ausch- witz trial, the best known being those of the Munich Institut für Zeit- geschichte (Institute for Contemporary History). 79 However, none of these reports was forensic in nature. They addressed legal, historical, or psychological topics. Throughout this mammoth trial, the court, the prosecution, 80 and the defense 81 never suggested that material traces of the alleged crime be secured and investigated. The prosecution had at its disposal numerous statements by eyewitnesses and confessions by perpetrators, and it considered this material entirely sufficient to estab-   78 For this, see chapter 6.7. 79 H. Buchheim et al. , Anatomie des SS-Staates , Walter, Freiburg 1964. 80 Throughout his writings, Adalbert Rückerl, one of the most prominent Ge rman prosecutors in ‘Holocaust cases’, dispenses w ith any mention of material ev idence. Instead, he declares documentary evidence the best and most important form of evidence, ev en in the absence of material evidence for the authen ticity and correctness of the docum ents themselves (in J. We- ber, P. Steinbach (eds.), Vergangenheitsbewältigung durch Strafverfahren? , Olzog, Munich 1984, p. 77). Rückerl reports that it is practica lly impossible to find a suspect guilty solely on documentary evidence, so that, especially given the increasing time span separating alleged crimes from trial, it is almost always nece ssary to fall back on eyewitness testimony, even though its unreliability is clear, particularly in tr ials of so-called ‘National Socialist violent crimes’ (A.

It lacked the bodies of the victims, autopsy records, expert reports on the cause of death and the time of death; it lacked any trace of the murderers, murder we apons, etc. An examination of the eye- witness testimony was only possible in rare cases. Where the slightest doubt existed or the possibility of a confusion could not be excluded with certainty, the court did not evaluate the testimony of witnesses [...] ” 4.4.1.3. The 1972 Vienna Auschwitz Trial Between January 18 and March 10, 1972, two architects responsi- ble for the design and construction of the crematoria in Auschwitz- Birkenau, Walter Dejaco and Fritz Er tl, were put on trial in Vienna, Austria. 84 During the trial, an expert report on the possible interpreta- tion of the blueprints of the allege d gas chambers of the Auschwitz and Birkenau crematoria was presented to the court. The report concluded that the rooms in question could not have been gas chambers, nor could they have been converted into gas chambers. 85 Thanks to this first methodologically sound expert report on Auschwitz, the defen- dants were acquitted.   82 One of the most prominent German advocates of this thesis is Profe ssor Ernst Nolte in his book Streitpunkte , Propyläen, Berlin 1993, pp. 290, 293, 297. 83 Ref. 50/4 Ks 2/63; cf.

In Search of Mass Graves In 1966, the Auschwitz State Museum commissioned the Polish company Hydrokop to drill into the soil of the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp and to analyze the samples. It is not known whether this research was done in the context of the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial. The results, however, vanished into the museum’s archives: they have never been released, which by itself is revealing enough. Years later, however, several pages from this report were photocopied and sent to the Ger- man revisionist publisher Udo Wa lendy, who published them with commentary in an issue of his periodical. 86 Traces of bones and hair allegedly found at several places might indicate mass graves. The few pages published by Walendy, however, do not reveal whether these findings led to an excavation or a subsequent forensic study of the traces. It is not even evident whether the bone and hair samples col- lected are human or animal remains. 4.4.2.2. Faurisson a nd the Consequences As a result of Prof. Faurisson’s activities as described in chapter 3., forensic research on Auschwitz boomed since 1988. Each time a researcher came to a conclusion contradicting the widely held views, he was socially ostracized and persecuted, like Prof. Faurisson, Fred Leuchter, and Germar Rudolf, but when the results confirmed the reigning paradigms, the researchers were darlings of the media and politicians, like Jean-Claude Pressac, the researchers from the Jan- Sehn-Institute in Cracow, and more recently Prof. Robert van Pelt. 69 It must therefore be stated that forensic research on Auschwitz is not at all reprehensible, as stated by the Max-Planck-Institute in Stutt- gart. Such research was always done, more or less intensively. What is often considered to be reprehensibl e, however, is a research result that is unwanted by the public. This is an unfortunate bias, because science can prosper only where any result is openly and freely published and discussed without researchers fearing punitive measures.

Auschwitz 5.1. Introduction 5.1.1. “Opera During the Holocaust We are all familiar with the name Auschwitz. Most people could identify Auschwitz as a ‘death camp ’ for the Jews. Many people might be capable of recalling that it was located in Poland. Many would be uncertain of details, but would be at least familiar with the name. In any case, it is a part of modern culture. Auschwitz is usually depicted as the place of incessant, methodical and centrally-planned extermination of the Jews (not the Jewish race, as there is none.) There are many accounts and descriptions about the total horror, the pervasive atmosphere of suffering and the impending assembly line of death. Could such a place possibly have had a swimming pool for the prisoners? Could it have been equipped with a social-educational centre, organized discussion groups, concerts, theatre, a children’s choir, opera performances—all run by, and for, the internees? Impos- sible! That wouldn’t fit in with the image with which we are all famil- iar. Anyone prepared to search books, papers, and videos presenting the non-establishment evidence and opinions—material which, signifi- cantly, is never available in ma instream book shops—will become fa- miliar with this information. The swimming pool has appeared in published reproductions of various wartime aerial photographs. Of course, these photos could be fakes; but the prisoner’s pool— now seen close-up– appears in a video filmed in modern-day Auschwitz. Th is video includes a rather surpris- ing interview with the head tour guide and the director of the modern- day camp, Dr. Franciszek Piper. The film was made by David Cole. Mr. Cole is an American Jew. Perhaps the video is a forgery. But if the other facilities did, in fact, exist, then the swimming pool is quite plausible. For evidence of the reality of the other facilities, let’s turn to no less a source than the Jerusalem Post (domestic edition), January, 25,"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 50 1995, (Features), page 7.

Now a university professor, he looks back at a different face of the death camp’, runs the introduction. Professor K. writes: ‘The Chorale from [Beethoven’s Ni nth Symphony] was... performed by a Jewish children’s choir at Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1943... I was a member of that choir... I... remember my first engagement with cul- ture, with history, and with music—in the camp...’ ‘In March 1944, I was severely ill with diphtheria and was sent to the camp hospital barracks. My moth er had asked to be transferred to stay with me in the hospital. [R esponse not stated]... Nurses, doctors, and patients survived...’ Why nurses, doctors, even hospitals, for people who were sent there to be killed? Why was the boy fed, clothed, and housed for be- tween two and three years? Daniel K continues: ‘One of the youth leaders of our group... asked to establish an education centre for children. He wa s given permission, and in a short time the education centre became a spiritual and social centre for the family camp. [The family camp!] It was the soul of the camp. ‘Musical and theatrical perfor mances, including a children’s op- era, were held at the centre. There were discussions of various ideolo- gies—Zionism, Socialism, Czech nationalism... There was a conductor named Imre... (who) organized the ch ildren’s choir. Rehearsals were held in a huge lavatory barracks where the acoustics were good... ‘(In) the fall 1944... huge masses of inmates fit for labour were being sent to Germany.’ (End quote.) Ah, so ‘huge masses’ of them w ere kept fit to work! I have deliber- ately ignored the many usual referen ces to extermination, gas ovens, and so on; they are available ad nauseam all around us. My purpose is to bring to attention the admitted existence of these leisure facilities. Their existence can no longer be doubted. Their exis- tence throws a new and thought-provoking light on those familiar sto- ries we all know: Could it be that Auschwitz was not quite the type of place usually described?” The above article by Dan McSw eeney was published on May 1, 1997, in the Australian newspaper Killoy Sentinel (New South Wales)."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"5.

These descriptions are, of course, not the dominant theme. They are mentioned in passing, alongside the well-known hor- ror stories and atrocities. It is only when one deliberately looks for such things and compiles them that one becomes aware of what a para- doxical image these contemporary witnesses of Auschwitz actually portray—and not just of Auschwitz, by any means. That should be suf- ficient ‘food for thought’ for any of us. A consistent analysis of the eyewitness accounts which have, in the meantime, multiplied to sheer infinity, from this point of view, remains to be compiled. Who dares to perform this thankless task? 5.1.2. On the History of the Camp Although the name of Auschwitz, a town in Polish Upper Silesia, is utilized as a synonym for the alleged National Socialist crime of an assembly-line extermination of Jews—frequently described as ‘unique’—thus far, worldwide, there has never been any balanced de- scription of this concentration camp. Generally, only three books, from the thousands on the subject, are worth selecting for discussion here. Danuta Czech’s Kalendarium , a work of post-war Polish-Commu- nist propaganda, resembles a sort of catalogue of chronological listing of actual and invented individual ev ents, without any attempt to draw up a theoretically definitive and critical view of the existing material on the history of the camp. 89 Jean-Claude Pressac’s works concen trate almost exclusively on   88 “ David Cole Interviews Dr. Franciszek Piper, Director, Auschwitz State Museum ” , VHS Video, distributed by CODOH, P.O.

Camp II, located in the vicinity of the city of Birkenau (known as Auschwitz-Birkenau), was rebuilt after the start of the Russian cam- paign, officially as a Waffen SS prisoner of war camp for the reception of Russian POWs. Both camps belonged to the same complex, with over 30 additional smaller camps in Upper Silesia, intended to supply manpower, etc., for the chemical wo rks recently built by the Germans on a large scale at Auschwitz, in pa rticular the BUNA works of the German industrial giant I.G.

The cramming together of large number of people in the most re- stricted areas of the camp, the sanitary infrastructure of which was just being developed, caused serious health problems in all camps of the Third Reich. Both inmates and hundreds of civilians working in the camps could introduce all sorts of parasitic insects into the camp, in particular lice and fleas. Lice are the chief carriers of epidemic typhus which was a widespread disease in Eastern Europe. Therefore, the camps were equipped with hygienic installations, including extensive disinfestation installations, in whic h the clothing and personal effects of newly arriving inmates were disi nfested, for instance with the insec- ticide Zyklon B (a porous carrier material soaked with liquid hydrogen cyanide), a product frequently used for this purpose. The inmates themselves were given a haircut 96 and were made to shower thor- oughly. Since the camp was at times insufficiently equipped with dis- infestation installations and materials, also aided by the carelessness during disinfestation on the part of civilians working in the camp, ty- phus epidemics broke out repeatedly killing large numbers of inmates as well as guards. Due to the high mortality rate, these camps were equipped with cremation facilities. After a devastating typhus epidemic during the summer of 1942, during which more than 300 people died per day in peak times, plans were made to build four cremation facilities at Birk- enau in the hope of being able to cope with the amount of corpses. Of these four crematoria, however, two were severely damaged shortly after they were put into operation. Since it turned out that the capacity of the four Birkenau crematoria w as much higher than needed, the two damaged crematoria were not repaired but were allowed to remain idle. The main camp in Auschwitz possessed only one crematorium installa- tion which was put out of operation with the opening of the installa- tions at Birkenau. Historians today usually assume that the above mentioned crema- tion installations were not only used for the purpose initially planned, i.e. , the incineration of inmates having died of natural causes, but were later misused for the mass extermination of the Jews, among others.

For this purpose, human beings are said to have been killed (‘gassed’), after a few structural modifica- tions, in a few rooms in the particular cremation installations, using Zyklon B—actually intended for vermin control. Allegedly, the victims were then burnt, some of them in the cremation ovens and some in open ditches. According to eyewitness accounts, a homicidal gas chamber is supposed to have existed in the crem atorium of Auschwitz I; this loca- tion still exists today, intact, but has been the object of serious manipu- lation, as we shall see. Additional homicidal gas chambers are said to have existed in the Birkenau cam p, Auschwitz II, located approxi- mately three kilometers away.

Danger of Epidemics 97 Before the era of modern warfare, it has always been taken for granted that during a war epidemic disease caused more deaths among the soldiers and civilians than the use of weapons. It took the atomic bomb, deployed in a ruthless and criminal manner by the United States against unarmed people and in contra vention of international law, to change this assumption. The epidemic most feared in World War I at the eastern front was typhus. 98 Typhus epidemics claimed uncounted thousands of lives among German soldiers at the Russian front and could be prevented from spreading into German territory after the end of the war only by the most rigorous of measures. Since that time, the danger of epidem- ics has been taken seriously by medical and military offices and per- sonnel. 99 For example, the German encyclopedia Der große Brockhaus , vol. VI of the 1930 Leipzig edition, contains a comprehensive article on epidemic typhus. This acute infectious disease is spread only by the body louse: 100 “The disease is caused by Rickettsia prowazeki (discovered in 1910 by Ricketts and in 1913 by Prowazek), a micro-organism found in the in- testines and salivary glands of infected lice. [...] Epidemic typhus occurs chiefly where unfavorable social and sani- tary conditions prevail: in dank overcrowded living quarters, hospitals,   97 The following remarks are largely based on H.J.

Whereas Typhus is the term used in English to refer to all diseases caused by various Rickettsia bacte- ria, the German term is “Fleckfieber”, which, in English, is used only for one type of typhus, the so-called Rocky Montain Spotted Fever that is transferred by ticks; see http://www.merck.com/pubs/mmanua l/section13/chapter159/159a.htm 99 O. von Schjerning, Handbuch der Ärztlichen Erf ahrungen im Weltkrieg 1914/1918 , volume VII Hygiene, J.

[...] Successful control and prevention of ep idemic typhus consists of en- forcing all measures available to destroy the body louse.” The experiences of German physicians during WWII were no dif- ferent. 101,102 The topic of epidemics can be found in countless publica- tions. Practical experiments were also conducted which increased the knowledge about fighting the causes of this disease. Professor Dr. F. Konrich was completely justified in stating, in his publication “ About sanitation facilities of German POW camps ” 103 that epidemics such as those in question “[...] had long been extinct here [in Germany] . ” However, it also becomes quite understandable why all of the offices and institutions involved over-reacted when epidemic typhus broke out in the Auschwitz concentration camp in early July 1942. 104 The outbreak was traced to the civilian laborers brought in to work in the camp, rather than to inmates deported to Auschwitz. Also, due to drastic measures taken to isolate and eradicate this epidemic, its spreading to the camp’s nearby civilian population could be prevented. 5.2.2. Epidemic Control with Zyklon B One of the most efficient methods to fight lice and thereby to con- tain and eliminate typhus—but also to kill other vermin like grain bee- tles, bugs, cockroaches, termites, mice, rats and many more—is their poisoning with highly volatile hydrogen cyanide. Liquid hydrogen cyanide has a short shelf life and is extremely dangerous with incorrect handling. At the end of the First World War, hydrogen cyanide was introduced onto the market in an easier to han-   101 R.

This product, called Zyklon B, was then packed in tin cans, which can only be opened with a special tool. The number of patents filed for the additives to Zyklon B shows that there was no simple, clear solution to the problems relating to the stabilizers and irritant warning materials. 105 Legally, there was a great difference between the stabilizer for Zyklon B and the irritant warning material. A stabilizer for Zyklon B was required by German law, 106 while an irritant warning material, by contrast, was not legally re- quired. 107 Zyklon B was licensed and produced by the DEGESCH 108 corpo- ration residing in Frankfurt. 109 Until the end of the Second World War, it played an extraordinarily important role in the struggle against insect pests and rodents 110,111 in food warehouses, large-scale means of trans-   105 See also, in this regard, Wo lfgang Lambrecht, Otto Karl, Das Handelsprodukt Zyklon B , soon to be published on the internet at www.vho.org/D/Beitraege/Zyklon.html. 106 Deutsche Reichsbahn Eisenba hnverkehrsordnung (EVO, German Reich railway regulations), annex C to §54 EVO, Vorschriften über die nur bedingt zur Beförderung zugelassenen Ge- genstände vom 1.

A USCHWITZ 63 There are also guidelines on the fumigation of property and rooms, describing the procedures in deta il, both before and afterwards. 127,128 These do not considerably differ from the regulations in application today. 129 Based upon this, the following is a brief discussion of the technology and method of procedure employed. Initially, for the disinfestation of personal effects, ordinary rooms (10 to 30 m 2 surface area) were temporarily modified, by making the windows and doors as gas-tight as possible by means of felt sealant material and paper strips, while pr oviding for proper heating and venti- lation of the rooms. Workers wearing gas masks spread Zyklon B evenly on the floor of the room containing the property to be disin- fested. This procedure was similar to what was then the regular fumi- gation of ordinary rooms for the destruction of vermin. Such converted rooms may be seen even today in the main camp of Auschwitz I. The use of temporarily sealed rooms for fumigation purposes is not without risk since the sealing is never perfect. Later, special gas-tight installations without windows were built, equipped with efficient heating and ventilation systems, and later also with circulating air systems for a more rapid circulation of the gas in- side the room (so-called “ DEGESCH-Kreislaufverfahren ,” DEGESCH circulation procedure, see Fig. 14). Cans of Zyklon B were opened by means of an exterior mechanism, so that the workers were no longer exposed to danger. The bottom of the can was automatically punctured and the preparation fell into a basket, into which a fan blew hot-air, thus quickly evaporating the hydrogen cyanide and carrying the fumes   123 G.

These installations, with the so-called circulation procedure, were relatively small in size, a few m 3 , to economize on the highly- expensive vermin destruction product. These professional installations were often part of an entire hygi- enic complex. As a rule, this building complex was organized ap- proximately as follows in terms of purpose (see Fig. 15): 103 – Undressing room, ‘dirty side’. People to be deloused removed their soiled clothing and handed them over for disinfestation/dis- infection. – Shower. Prisoners washed themselves after undressing, plus some- times other procedures, such as haircuts, medical examinations, including a sauna. – Dressing room, ‘clean side’.

A USCHWITZ 65 It was not uncommon for a crematorium to be installed in the same building complex, as may still be seen at Dachau concentration camp today (near Munich), in which the new hygienic installation pos- sesses a series of DEGESCH circulating air installations for the disin- festation of clothing, with an undressing and redressing room to the right and left of the inmate showers, as well as a crematorium. (The room described as a “ gas chamber ” at Dachau today is actually the inmate shower, which is indispensab le in the above schema, and which has been intentionally mislabeled by the Museum.) The applicable concentrations during the disinfestation of clothing might be very different according to the type of vermin and exterior conditions, and usually ranged from 5 to 30 g of hydrogen cyanide per m 3 of air. The application time varied just as greatly, from under two hours up to ten hours and more. In the more modern installations with heating (higher than 25°C) and circ ulating air/ventilation installations, good results could be attained with concentrations of 20 g per m 3 , al- ready after 1 to 2 hours. Disinfestation in ordinary rooms, on the other hand, could last up to 24 hours or more. 5.2.3. Epidemic Control in Auschwitz 5.2.3.1. Terminology Us ed and Responsibilities We shall use the technical terms established in the 1939 German Army Regulations ( Heeresdienstvorschrift 194), 127 since these deter- mined how the personnel, i.e. , the physicians and those who disin- fected the camps, were to proceed: “ Disinfection Disinfection means [...] : destroying the disease-(epidemic-)causing agents on objects, in rooms, in excre tions and on the bodies of infectious persons.

Similarly, a “ work guideline ” was re- leased in 1943 by the Sanitation Institute of the Waffen-SS: “ Ent- keimung, Entseuchung und Entwesung ” 114 (Sterilization, Disinfection and Disinfestation). The authority in charge of sanitation in the Waffen-SS as well as in the concentration camps was the “ Hygieneinstitut der Waffen-SS ” 132 (Sanitation Institute of the Waffen- SS), established in 1942 in Berlin, which set up a branch office in 1943 in Rajsko near Auschwitz, with its “ Hygienisch–bakteriologischen Untersuchungsstelle Südost d.

Where hydrogen cyanide was to be used, re- quirements called for specially traine d expert personnel. In Auschwitz, this role was filled by the “ disinfectors ”. 5.2.3.2.

A USCHWITZ 69 or not the existing disinfestation inst allations were consistently reliable for the indicated number of persons. Pressac, in the conclusions to his second book, 138 indicates the peak of the first epidemic between “ 7./11. September ” 1942 with “ 375 deaths per day ”, which clearly indicates that the capacity of the facilities available did not suffice. 5.2.3.4. Basic Policy Decisions Two policy decisions made by the SS-Hauptamt Haushalt und Bauten (SS Main Office Budget and Construction) in the Reich Ad- ministration of the SS and its successor no doubt also influenced the measures taken in the camp. The first decision of June 5, 1940, 139 stated that HCN would no longer be used, and replaced instead with a hot-air method. The reason for this was probably that the use of HCN in makeshift delousing chambers was not reliable and had caused many accidents and was thus deemed too dangerous. The second decision, issued on March 11, 1942, 140 21 months later, seems to have reversed that first decision by calling for the “[...] conversion of all delousing facilities to operation with HCN ”, in which regard it was noted: “Deviations therefrom—delousing by means of hot air or hot steam—is only permissible insofar as they involve temporary installa- tions, in which the necessary safety for the handling of HCN is not as- sured.” A further letter from the Office C VI of February 11, 1943, 141 to the Commandant again expressly states, probably with reference to the letter of June 5, 1940: “[...] as per the prohibition against the use of HCN for disinfestation [...]”. This means that all efforts were to be made to convert all facilities to be operated with the only really reliable method available—HCN—but that the use of HCN was allowed only where and if the necessary safety and reliability of the method was as- sured, i.e. , makeshift delousing chambers were not allowed to be oper- ated with HCN. Men in positions of authority, accustomed to decision-making, and faced with a dangerous epidemic cap able of spreading to the civilian population with incalculable consequences, will always take suitable   138 J.-C.

Hydrogen cyanide (= Zyklon B) was the most reliable disinfestation agent of its time (for details, please see “ Blausäure als Entlausungsmittel in Begasungskammern” , 142 or “ Ent- lausung mit Zyklon-Blausäure in Kreislauf-Begasungskammern ”. 143 The only problem was in finding a safe location for such facilities, perhaps outside the actual camp (see chapter 5.4.3.). 5.2.3.5. The Army Medical Officer On September 9, 1942, Dr. E. Wirths was stationed in Auschwitz as garrison physician. From the records we may say that he performed his duties correctly; in this context, reference is made, in particular, to his massive criticism of the highest echelons. As time went by, the number of inmates increased steadily, and unfortunately there were more than just one epidemic. We shall there- fore briefly summarize, by means of examples, the conclusions reached by this physician and the steps he took in consequence. On December 4, 1942, Dr. Wirths reported to headquarters about a discussion held in the administrative council of Bielitz District. The subject was epidemic typhus. A cons iderable number and range of per- sons had participated in the discussion, including the medical officer, the Wehrmacht, and representatives of the government. This illustrates how seriously the epidemic was taken to be: 144 “He reports that at present three large disinfestation, shower, and sauna facilities could be put into opera tion, specifically two facilities for the inmates and one for the members of the SS troops. The capacity of these facilities is some 3,000 to 4,000 persons per 24 hours. Zyklon B disinfestation has been discontinued entirely, since it has been found that success is not 100% certain with this procedure.” Buildings BW5a and 5b were intended for the inmates. The capac- ity of these disinfestation facilities was probably adequate for the num- ber of inmates at this time. One must consider, however, that at this same time the structural shell for another 19 DEGESCH circulation   142 Gerhard Peters and W.

A USCHWITZ 71 fumigation chambers was being completed in Building BW160 of the Main Camp (Admissions building). Another paragraph of the above letter states that the garrison physician of Kattowitz had provided the loan of two mobile boiler installations. On April 18, 1943, Wirths reports to the Commandant, with warn- ing reference to the sewer system in Birkenau, and concludes that “[...] great danger of epidemics is inevitable. ” 145 On May 7, 1943, in a discussion with the chief of Amtsgruppe C, SS Brigadier General and Major Ge neral of the Waffen-SS engineer Dr. Kammler, and others, the garrison physician set out in chapter “ II. Bauten in Zuständigkeit des Standortarztes ” (II. Buildings Under the Charge of the Garrison Physician): 146 “ [...] that the continued health of the inmates for the major tasks is not guaranteed, due to the poor to ilet conditions, an inadequate sewer system, the lack of hospital barracks, and separate latrines for the sick, and the lack of washing, bathing, and disinfestation facilities.” Dr. Wirths clearly pointed out the inadequacies and also how to rectify them. At this point we must warn the reader, who may perhaps not be sufficiently aware of the historical c ontext, not to jump to false conclu- sions. The reader may well lack an understanding of all the problems that were involved in obtaining materials as well as all the other neces- sities required to build these faciliti es in wartime. Figuratively speak- ing, a written permission was required to purchase every brick. We must also point out that, in those days in eastern Europe, a sewer system of any kind at all was exemplary to start with, and that this is all the more true for sewage treatment facilities, which were built for both camps at great expenditure in resources and according to high technical standards. The above quoted document continues: “The Brigadier General acknowledges the foremost urgency of these matters and promises to do everything po ssible to ensure rectification of the shortcomings. He is somewhat surprised, however, that the medical side presents him with reports givi ng a very favorable account of the sanitary and hygienic conditions on the one hand; while he is then im- mediately confronted with reports to the exact opposite effect on the   145 TCIDK 502-1-332-219 146 TCIDK 502-1-233-33/38"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 72 other hand. The Chief of the Zentralbauleitung is hereby instructed to pre- sent suggestions for rectification by May 15, 1943.” (Emphasis added.) It began with the toilet facilities, with regards to which he en- forced changes that he considered necessary. For example: lids on the toilets, because otherwise “[...] a great danger of epidemics is inevita- ble. ” 147 These lids were ordered by the Head of Department C of the WVHA ( Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt , Economic Administrative Main Office) on May 10, 1943. 148 It ended with roofing matters related to the gypsy kindergarten: 149 “For the damaged roofs of kindergarten blocks 29 and 31 in the Gypsy Camp I request 100 rolls of roofing felt (very urgent.)” In between, on May 28, 1943, 150 he selected six circulating air de- lousing facilities which—as was noted down in handwriting—were ordered on May 29, 1943, by the Building Administration’s expert on heating matters, Jährling. Then there is an account of a water quality test on June 1, 1943, 151 etc. This extensive correspondence resulted in separate subject files in the filing system of the Zentralbauleitung , such as “ Sanitary Conditions ”. 152 The physician’s field of work was great and varied and deserved its own monograph. He was even responsible for ensuring that the in- mates’ kitchen personnel were fre quently examined—including labora- tory tests of their stool, etc. That Dr. Wirths truly saw to absolutely everything is obvious from the documents. The garrison physician’s reminders and admonitions increased over time. On balance, one must conclude that, just as today, while there were opportunists and careerists in those days, there were also— as our example shows—SS-men with backbone and a sense of duty, professional ethics and the courage to stand up for their beliefs.

A USCHWITZ 73 5.2.3.6. Short-Wave Delousing Facility Perhaps one of the most fascina ting aspects of Auschwitz concen- tration camp is the installation of a stationary short-wave installation, the world’s first technological predecessor to the microwave ovens in common use today. This technology was invented by Siemens in the late 1930s and developed to mass- production readiness during the war. This was a by-product of the powerful radio tubes built for the televi- sion transmission of the Berlin Olympics in 1936, the energy-rich radio waves which killed the insects in the vicinity of the antenna. The de- velopment took place with financial assistance from the Wehrmacht, which hoped to achieve a perceptible improvement in the struggle against the epidemics raging in th e east. Since the inmates assigned to the armaments industries in the concentration camps were particularly valuable towards the end of the war, the Reich leadership decided not to put the first installation into operation at the front for the disinfesta- tion of soldiers’ clothing, but rather, in the largest Labor complex in the Reich, in Auschwitz. Due to Allied bombing attacks, however, there was a one-year delay in the completion of this installation, which probably cost the lives of tens of thousands of inmates. The Auschwitz camp administration had anticipated its installation as early as 1943 and had therefore postponed other del ousing projects. This facility, put into operation during the summer of 1944, proved in fact to be of revo- lutionary effectiveness, both quick and cheap: personal effects were moistened and placed on one end of a conveyor belt and emerged at the other end a few minutes later, completely free of vermin and ster- ile. 153 5.2.4. Disinfestation Installations BW 5a und 5b The only buildings remaining intact in Auschwitz-Birkenau today, possessing a wing for the disinfestation of personal effects with Zyklon B, are buildings ( Bauwerk , BW) 5a and 5b in building sections B1a and B1b, respectively. Both buildings were planned as mirror images of each other. The west (resp. east) wing of these buildings were used,   153 See also, in this regard, H.-J. Nowak, op. cit. (note 97); H.

These rooms were expressly labeled “ Gaskammer ” (gas chamber) in the building plans, see Fig. 17. This is no triviality: rather, it is important proof that the term ‘gas chamber’, at that time, referred exclusively to installations for the disinfestation of personal effects, both by architects during the planning of such buildings, and by disinfestation experts.

There are two reasons for this: 1. The German technical term Gaskammer originally pointed ex- clusively to disinfestation chambers operated with toxic gas. To apply the same term to chambers intended for the execution of human beings is an incorrect use of the term at that time. 2.

The room has a surface area of approximately 130 m 2 , is open to the framework of the roof, and therefore has a volume of at least 400 m 3 . However, the space above 2 m in height must probably be consi- dered to have been unusable dead space, resulting in the waste of huge amounts of HCN/Zyklon B, since a quantity of Zyklon B of at least 4 to 5 kg (10 g per m 3 ) cyanide content was necessary for just one gas- sing, 156 regardless of whether the room contained only a few personal effects or whether the available area was filled. For example, with 100 fumigation cycles per year (one every 3 or 4 days) approximately 0.8 tons of Zyklon B would have been c onsumed by this installation alone and by building 5a, corresponding to 10% of the entire Zyklon B de- liveries to Auschwitz in 1942, with a total delivery of 7.5 tons. 157 When one considers that there were other HCN disinfestation in- stallations in Birkenau in addition to this one; that the deliveries to Birkenau camp also supplied the related labor camps (more than 30 in number); and the fact that inmate barracks were also occasionally fu- migated with this insecticide, 158 it will be seen that the quantities of Zyklon B delivered to Auschwitz camp can actually be explained by normal delousing activities. The annual delivery quantities were too low to ensure successful disinfestation of all personal effects and buildings in all camps in the Auschwitz complex, since typhus epidemics were never entirely elimi- nated. How frequently the delousing cham bers of BW 5a and 5b were ac- tually used for HCN disinfestation has to remain open for the time be- ing, since no documentation about this has been found yet, and also because the document cited above states that the use of Zyklon B had to be abandoned as early as December 1942 (at least in unsafe installa-   156 The gross mass given on the label of a Zyklon B can always refered to the net HCN content of the can, i.e., ex cluding the mass of the carrier material .

A remarkable feature of this room in building BW 5b is the intricate construction of the water pipes, laid in the hooks fastened to the diagonal roof girders, visible in Fig. 20. A few of the pipe endings are equipped with shower heads. The water pipes have no con- nection. Paradoxically, they end in the above mentioned ventilation outlets, and can only have been installed after the removal of the ventilators installed there. There are, of course, shower rooms in these buildings, but in a very differ- ent location (see Fig. 17). The shower installations once in existence there, however, have b een entirely dismantled. Since the doors to these rooms are open, any visitor may examine this peculiar construction. The original German drawings and documents of this building do not indicate that these pipes were installed during the German occupation, which means that they were probably installed after the war for an unknown reason. 5.3. ‘Gas Chamber’ in the Auschwitz I Main Camp According to Pressac, no material or documentary evidence of the ‘gas chamber’ in the crematorium in the main camp exists, but there are many eyewitness accounts: 159 “As evidence to establish the reality of homicidal gassings there remain only the testimonies of participants, [...] ”   159 J.-C.

A USCHWITZ 79 These accounts, according to Pressac, are characterized by many contradictions, technical impossib ilities, and general incredibility. He observes a “ general tendency to exaggerate ”, and explains the gross errors and technical impossibilities in the eyewitness accounts and writings of camp commandant Höß by stating: “He was present, without seeing.” That is, Pressac alleges that Höß had no idea of the methods, risks and dangers involved in the handling of Zyklon B. But this is in con- tradiction to an order issued by commandant Höß calling for caution during the fumigation of barracks with Zyklon B 158 —caution which had become necessary in view of several cases of poisoning. This spe- cial order of the commandant warning of accidents involving Zyklon B gas, an order which was distributed throughout the camp, indicates a duty of care with regards to those inmates who were, allegedly and nevertheless, doomed to die from the effects of that same gas sooner or later. We will have occasion to speak of Höß’s testimony at a later time. Pressac, moreover, explains the form and basic tone of the testi- mony of SS man Pery Broad as incorrect because this testimony is soaked in Polish patriotism, to say nothing of the transparent Polish hatred against SS men, although Broad was an SS man himself and had no links to Poland, and because Pressac found out that this ‘testimony’ has been slightly reworked by the Po les, the original of which is miss- ing. In other words, this ‘documen t’, obviously patched together by the Poles, is quite worthless insofar as a critical examination of its source is concerned. Nevertheless, Pressac considers the basic testimonies with regards to homicidal gassings to be correct. 160 The ‘gas chamber’ in the main camp is a room in a ground level building, which replaced a former kitchen building of the former Austro-Hungarian barracks located at the same spot. 161 The floor and ceiling of crematorium I are of reinforced concrete while the exterior walls are of brick masonry, insulated on the exterior by a coating of tar. Except for the access ways, the building is practically underground due to the fact that dirt has been piled up against the walls.

Direct access to the air raid shelters, which evolved from the mul- tiple division of the morgue/‘gas chamber’, was possible through a newly added entrance with sluice, which today is represented as the entryway taken by the victims, although the ‘gas chamber’ had no en- trance in that location—as a matter of fact, it had no direct entrance from the outside at all. 163 Toilets were likewise built into the former washroom at this time.

The partitions in the air-raid shelter, including the wall to the washroom, which was, however, never part of the morgue (the late r ‘gas chamber’), were torn down. Accordingly, the irritated visitor sees two discharge pipes from two toilets inside the alleged ‘gas chamber’.

In the 50s and 60s, several buildings which had disappeared or had been misappropriated were re- built with gross errors and displayed as authentic. Some, which were ‘too new’, have been closed for the public. Not to mention the delousing gas chambers which were sometimes presented as homicidal gas cham- bers. Those aberrations have helped the deniers a lot, which took the es- sence for their legends out of it. The example of the Crematory I is typi- cal. In its morgue, the first gas chamber was installed. It operated for a short period of time in early 1942. The blocking of this area, which was essential for the gassings, disturbed the operation of the camp. End of April 1942, it was therefore decided to move the deadly gassings to Birk- enau, were it was conducted on an industrial scale mainly with Jewish victims. The Crematory I was subsequently converted into an air raid shelter with a surgery room. In 1948, when the Museum was created, Crematory I was reconstructed in a supposed original state . Everything in it is false : [171] the dimensions of the gas chamber, the locations of the doors, the openings for pouring in Zykl on B, the ovens, rebuilt according to the recollections of some survivors, the height of the chimney.

According to the inflection: they were lying, they are lying, they will be lying... In view of this unrealistic ‘rec onstructions’ carried out after the war, the Jewish-American professor of architecture Robert van Pelt, who actually is only a professor for cultural history, in co-operation with the Jewish-Canadian Holocaust historian Deborah Dwork, arrives at the following, no less unequivocal conclusions: 173 “The architecture designed to enact the metamorphosis from Mensch to Untermensch was intact when the Soviets liberated the camp in 1945. All traces of it were removed subsequently. The guidebook for sale in the bookstore does not mention the building [crematorium I] at all. Perhaps the men and women who created the museum could not rec- oncile its implications with their ideology of a resistance: an ideology that denied total victimization. Perhaps it was simply a question of re- sources and the need for tourist services. Whether for doctrinal or prac- tical reasons, the destruction of the original arrangement within the pre- sent visitor reception center is a postwar obfuscation and a loss. There have been additions to the camp the Russians found in 1945 as well as deletions, and the suppressi on of the prisoner reception site is matched by the reconstruction of crematorium I just outside the north- east perimeter of the present museum camp. With its chimney and its gas chamber, the crematorium functions as the solemn conclusion for tours through the camp. Visitors are not told that the crematorium they see is largely a postwar reconstruction. When Auschwitz was transformed into a museum after the war, the decision was taken to con centrate the history of the whole complex into one of its component parts. The infamous crematoria where the mass murders had taken place lay in ruins in Birkenau, two miles away. The committee felt that a crematorium was required at the end of the memo- rial journey, and crematorium I was reconstructed to speak for the his- tory of the incinerators at Birkenau. This program usurpation was rather detailed. A chimney, th e ultimate symbol of Birkenau, was re-created;   172 See Serge Thion (ed.), op. cit. (note 33), pp. 316f.; R.

There are no signs to explain these restitu- tions, they were not marked at the time, and the guides remain silent about it when they take visitors through this building that is presumed by the tourist to be the place where it happened .” This argument of the “usurpation ” is packed with dynamite, be- cause it suggests that the events alleged to have taken place in cremato- rium I, events described by eyewitnesses Rudolf Höß, Pery Broad and a few others actually never took place at this location. But this under- mines the credibility of all other eyewitnesses from the very outset, including those from Birkenau. We wonder if the authors are aware of this? It may at least be stated without fear of contradiction that the ceil- ing, exterior walls and pillars as well as the foundation of the building are in their original condition. If Zyklon B introduction stacks and ven- tilation openings had existed in the re inforced concrete roof, breaks in the reinforced concrete structure would be visible from the interior in the corresponding places, since these cannot have been made to disap- pear without leaving visible traces. In addition to today’s Zyklon B introduction stacks there are, however, no indications of any former openings in the roof. The holes alle gedly made in another location therefore never existed! The openings in the concrete visible today are neither plastered, nor have the remains of the cut steel reinforcement rods been removed in a professional manner. The holes ha ve been planked with wood and Figs. 24 and 25: Symptoms of decay visible on the interior ceiling of the morgue of crematorium I in Auschwi tz Main Camp.

Such poor workma nship reflects neither the care re- quired in handling a poisonous gas, nor standard German craftsman- ship. If the SS had put these holes in the concrete during the war, one must assume that they would have taken care to evenly distributed these holes in the ceiling of the original (!) morgue in order to ensure an even distribution of the Zyklon B inside the room. The stacks today, however, are only evenly distributed in the ceiling of this room if one considers the washing room, which was only incorporated after the war(!), as an integral part of the morgue (‘gas chamber’.) (See Figs. 21 and 23). Thus, the arrangement of today’s introduction holes only make sense if they were created esp ecially for its present status as a falsely dimensioned “ reconstruction for Museum purposes ” (B. Bailer- Galanda) 169 after the war. This by itself is strong circumstantial evi- dence that those holes were chiseled in after the interior walls of the former air raid shelter—one too many of them—had been torn down by the Soviets or the Poles. This is also supported by the fact that it has been generally assumed until the present day—without contradiction by any side—that the introduction holes visible today were indeed cre- ated after the war without recourse to the alleged remains of old, walled-up holes. 174 The flat roof of the crematorium, like all flat roofs, is not water- tight. Due to decades of erosion by rain water and the steel reinforce- ment rods, lying near the surface, rusting over time and splitting the concrete, 175 the interior of the room exhibits clear signs of decay; see Figs. 24f. The Museum administration has, of course, attempted to plaster these places, but the plaster is immediately destroyed by the crumbling of rust from the steel re inforcement rods. Janitors from the Museum are compelled to sweep away falling pieces of crumbling mortar and concrete.

(note 88). 175 Steel reinforcement rods in concrete are only practicable when the iron is deeply embedded in the concrete and therefore protected for decades against corrosion by the very durable alkaline environment of the concrete, since concrete is only slowly carbonated by the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the environment, resulting in a neutraliza tion of its pH value. The reinforcement rods in the ceiling of the morgue in question lie di rectly on the surface, where the pH value would fall very quickly ( i.e. , would become less alkaline), particularly when rain water containing CO 2 penetrated the concrete; see the crack in Fi g. 25 which would quickly allow the entry of rain water."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 88 through the roof. Such a claim is refuted by four facts: 1. The steel reinforcement rods would have had to have been re- moved during the opening of any holes. 2. A border between the old concre te of the ceiling and the filling material added later would also be visible. The corrosion locations all indicate a homogenous structure of the concrete. 3. These locations would have to be evenly distributed over the ceil- ing of the original morgue. 4. These locations would have to exhibit an even, regular form (round, square or rectangular). Based on all these arguments, it can be concluded with certainty that at the time of the alleged use of this rooms as a ‘gas chamber’, there were no openings for the introduction of Zyklon B. There is no indication of a former device to ventilate the room either. Furthermore, there was no direct access to the ‘g as chamber’ from the outside. The victims would have had to enter through the corpse room (laying out room), or through the oven room. They would, therefore, have had to file past the corpses of their alr eady-murdered companions in misery— truly a macabre spectacle. There could be no successful deception of the victims and camouflage nor could there be any hope of willing co- operation or acquiescence on the part of the inmates under such cir- cumstances.

Answer: As supervising engineer, I inspected the Huta Corpora- tion and dealt with the Zentralbauleitung of the SS. I also au- dited the invoices of our firm. Q.: Did you enter the camp? How did that happen? A.: Yes. One could walk everywhere without hindrance on the streets of the camp and was only stopped by the guards upon entering and leaving the camp. Q.: Did you see or hear anything about killings or mistreatment of inmates? A.: No. But lines of inmates in a relatively poor general condition could be seen on the streets of the camp. Q.: What did the Corporation build? A.: Among other things, crematoria II and III with the large morgues. Q.: The prevalent opinion is that these large morgues were gas chambers for mass killings. A.: Nothing of the sort could be deduced from the plans made available to us. The detailed plans and provisional invoices drawn up by us refer to these rooms as ordinary cellars.

I would certainly have expressed an objection to such an arrangement. Q.: Why were such large cellars bu ilt, when the water table in Birkenau was so extremely high? A.: I don’t know. Originally, however, above-ground morgues were to be built. The construction of the cellars caused great prob- lems in retention and sealing. Q.: Would it be conceivable that you were deceived and that the SS nevertheless had gas chambers to be built by your firm without your knowledge? A.: Anyone who knows anything about what happens on a building site knows that that is impossible. Q.: Do you know any gas chambers? A.: Naturally. Everyone in the east knew about disinfection cham- bers. We also built disinfection chambers, which look quite dif- ferent. We built such installati ons and knew what they looked like, even after the necessary inst allations. As a building firm, we often had work to do after installation of the machinery... Q.: When did you learn that your firm was supposed to have built gas chambers for industrial mass killing? A.: Only after the end of the war. Q.: Weren’t you quite amazed about it? A.: Yes! After the war I made contact with my former boss in Ger- many and asked him about it. Q.: What did you learn? A.: He also only learned about it after the war, but he assured me that the Huta Corporation certainly did not build the cellars in question as gas chambers. Q.: Would building alterations be conceivable after the withdrawal of the Huta Corporation? A.: Conceivable, sure, but I would ru le that out on the basis of time factors. After all, they would have needed corporations again, the SS couldn’t do that on their own, even with inmates. Based on the technical requirements for the operation of a gas cham- ber, which only became known to me later, the building erected by us would have been entirely unsuited for the purpose in re- gard to the necessary machinery and practicable operation.

I was never interrogated in this ma tter, although my services for the Huta Corporation were known. I mentioned them in all my later CVs and recruitment applications.

I have serious heart trouble and can die at any moment, it’s time now. Prof. van Pelt has stated as follows on crematorium II: 179 “Auschwitz is like the Holy of Holies. I’ve prepared for years to go there. And to have a fool [Leuchter] come in, coming completely unpre- pared, it’s sacrilege! Somebody who walks into the Holy of Holies and doesn’t give a damn.” [00:44:30] “Crematorium II is the most [word indistinct: notorious?] of Ausch- witz. In the twenty-five hundred square feet of this one room more people lost their lives than in any other place on this planet. Five hundred thou- sand people were killed. If you woul d draw a map of human suffering, if you create a geography of atrocities, this would be the absolute center.” [01:00:00] “If the Holocaust revisionists would be shown to be right we would lose our sense about the Second World War, we would lose our sense about what democracy was. The Second World War was a moral war; it was a war between good and evil. And so if we take the core of this war, which is in fact Auschwitz, out of the picture, then everything else be- comes unintelligible to us. We co llectively end up in a madhouse.” [01:23:30] We will not allow ourselves to be distracted by the notion that Prof. van Pelt considers internment in a madhouse the only alternative   179 Van Pelt’s testimony in Errol Morris’ documentary movie Mr Death , op. cit.

Van Pelt’s testimony does, however, em- phasize the importance of crematorium II (and crematorium III, built as a mirror image of crematorium II, although allegedly not used quite so intensively), which will be discussed in the following.

Fig. 26 is the ground plan of morgue 1 (alleged ‘gas chamber’) of crematorium II, which was designed mirror symmetrically to crematorium III. Fig. 27 shows the cross section through morgue 1. 180 As may be seen from the cross- section, these morgues, for the most part, are located below ground. The long and slender type of cons truction, the underground location, as well as the lack of contact with the cremation rooms result in an even, cool temperature in these areas. This corresponds to their having been planned as morgues, which is how they are designated in the building plans. The planning of such large cellars is not astonishing, furthermore, when one considers that several hundred corpses a day had arrived dur- ing the worst periods of the epidemics raging in Auschwitz, and that these corpses had to be stored some where. The compelling interpreta- tion of the non-criminal planning of these rooms as harmless morgues is shared even by Pressac. The documentation reproduced by Pressac shows that this installa- tion was derived from an earlier 1941 plan for a new crematorium in the main camp. 181 The access street to the crem atoria in Birkenau was located on the side of the chimney wing (see Fig. 29). The original plan for the main camp, however, provided for an access street on the other side of the building. Moreover, the high water table of the terrain in Birkenau did not permit location of the morgue quite under ground. 182 The cellars were therefore raised so as not to swim on top of the ground water. Together with the layer of earth on top of the cellars, these were insurmountable for vehicles and carts. Direct access to the cellars from the outside was therefore blocked. For this reason, an ad- ditional flight of stairs was incorporated to the offices of morgue 3 as well as a flight of stairs at the end of morgue 2 (see Fig. 29). Possibly as a result of the dramatically altered military situation after the German defeat of Stalingrad in the winter of 1942-43, all con- struction plans were reduced in costs and required manpower wherever   180 J.-C.

Hence, the new stairway s did not have corpse chutes as the old stairway. Several other cost-reducing changes were made on cre- matorium III. 183 Defects in the quality of the cheap material used for crematoria IV and V must have led to their early breakdown (see next chapter). The original basement stairways w ith corpse chutes of crematoria II and III had already been finished by then, although they could only be accessed with difficulty. That these st airs were built at all, indicates an over-hasty transmission of the old plans for the main camp to the new situation in Birkenau. The walls of the morgue consist of double brick masonry with a layer of tar in between for insulation. 183 The interior walls are plastered with a hard, cement-rich material, the ceiling and support pillars of reinforced concrete show the mark s of wooden planking and are there- fore not plastered. The roof, made of reinforced concrete, is isolated by a layer of tar, which is protected from environmental and mechanical damage by a rather thin layer of cement covering it. The layers of tar both on top of the roof as well as between the two brick walls was in- dispensable as a water barrier due to the high ground water in the swampy region of Birkenau. Both morgues had several drains. 5.4.1.2. The Obsessive Search for “ Criminal Traces ” Jean-Claude Pressac was the first researcher to dig through the mountains of documentation at the Auschwitz Museum and later through the documentation of the Zentralbauleitung stored in Moscow. He was also the first one to create the now-widely used term “criminal trace” . Based on the total absence of documents proving the erection of homicidal ‘gas chambers’, Pressac resorted to a semantic trick by attributing a criminal significance to harmless documents, which were said to constitute a clue that something was not quite right about the crematoria at Auschwitz. Based on the progress in research, however, all these ‘criminal traces’ compiled by Pressac and others and accom- panied by sometimes fantastic cerebral acrobatics have collapsed. The most notable of them are listed and briefly refuted in the following.   183 J.-C. Pressac, op. cit.

New Cellars Stairways Fact 1: Additional access ways via stairways from the outside were later incorporated into the cellars of crematoria II and III. Incorrect additional allegation: The corpse chute at the old, origi- nal stairway entrance was demolished. 184 Incorrect conclusion: The construction of new stairways without corpse chutes with the simultaneous demolition in the original stairway access way could mean only one thing: no more corpses were to go sliding into the cellars but rather people who were still able to walk down a few steps. Hence they had to be alive while entering, and were killed after they had entered the building. 185 Correct conclusion: The new stairways were necessary based on the alteration in the plans, see the chapter above. This is supported by the heading of the plan for the new stairways: “ Change of cellar access to street side ”. 186 The corpse chute, furthermore, was not even demol- ished.

If it were true that stairways without chutes could only be used by living persons still capable of climbi ng stairs on their own, then one might be permitted to ask: how did the corpses of persons having died of ‘natural causes’ get into the morgue (or wherever they were stored)? Did they walk by themselves? Of course not. They were carried, and sometimes certainly even a few steps up and down—and not only in- side the crematorium. Was it theref ore impossible to get corpses into a building not having a chute? Certainly not. Would missing chutes therefore prove that only living people could enter? Of course not. So why did the SS not build a new corpse chute by the new stairway? Perhaps simply because the costs of the crematorium were running out of control due to the constant changes in plans, and because it was de- sired or necessary to keep the costs down? Would that not be a much simpler and more logical explanation? 5.4.1.2.2.

Since there were still no proper means to drill holes in con- crete ceilings and no neat plastic rawl plugs in the 1940s, there was only one way to fasten installations to bare concrete walls: conical pieces of wood were cast in the concrete onto which the electrical lines, water pipes, and other installations were screwed tightly. The existence of such pieces of wood in the ceiling of morgue 1 does not prove that shower heads were fastened there. It is more probable that lamps or electrical lines were fasten ed there. Nor is there any proof that the “ showers ” mentioned in the document were “ false ”, as stated by Pressac. In actual fact, the Zentralbauleitung temporarily considered expanding the Birkenau crematoria into hygiene centers equipped with disinfestation inst allations, inmate showers and un- dressing rooms but nevertheless later abandoned these plans.

This project involved the installations intended for crematorium II. [201] In an undated ‘questionnaire’ appar ently written in June 1943 re- garding the Birkenau crematoria, in answer to the question, ‘Are the ex- haust gases utilized?’, the head of th e Zentralbauleitung, Bischoff, re- sponded: ‘planned but not carried out’, and in response to the following question: ‘If yes, to what purpose?’, Bischoff answered: ‘for bath facili- ties in crematorium II and III’.

Fig. 30. [203] Before drawing any conclusions, a few explanations are required. While both Topf disinfestation heaters were then installed in the Zentral- sauna, the document cited above refers them to crematorium II. The pro- ject for the installation of 100 showers in crematorium III (and in crema- torium II) could not have been for the prisoners of the ‘Sonderkom- mando’ of the crematoria, since only 50 showers were installed in the shower room of the Zentralsauna, which had been designed for the in-   199 Archiwum Panstwowego Muzeum w Oswiecimiu (hereafter APMO ), BW 30/34, p. 47. 200 APMO , BW 30/34, p. 40. 201 TCIDK , 502-1-336 (page number illegible). 202 TCIDK , 502-1-312, p. 8. 203 TCIDK , 502-1-316, p. 431, “ Zweitschrift ” in 502-1-323, p. 137."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"5. A USCHWITZ 99 mates of the entire camp; [204] therefore it is clear that the ‘bath facilities in crematorium II and III’ in the ‘questionnaire’ quoted above, were in- tended for the prisoners of the entire camp as well. This means that it was planned to convert the crematoria II and III into hygienic centers. The purpose of such centers was to cleanse the inmates and their clothing, i.e., to free them from dirt and disease-carrying parasites. But this necessarily included a disinfection or disinfestation installation. The expansion of the crematoria was not however completed because work had already begun in the meantime on the central sauna which was bet- ter suited for this purpose. The docum ents cited here nevertheless prove a temporary intent on the part of the Zentralbauleitung to perform cre- mation, inmate cleaning and the disinfestation of clothing in the same building. Now I think that it is not irrelevant to note here that in this project the water heating system for the showers was connected to the garbage incinerator and not to the crematorium oven, as for example in the five- muffle oven of the Lublin KL. In my opinion, the reason for that decision was the fact that the crematorium ovens did not ensure a continuity of use to be able to provide sufficient hot water throughout the entire day; in other words, the crematorium ovens were not used enough to ensure efficient operation of the water heating system. That the VEDAG-Invoice [203] indeed refers to the hot-air disinfesting chambers installed in the Zentralsauna, is definitely proven by a VEDAG single invoice which has the same date and the same contents as the first invoice noted above, but it refers to the ‘BW 32 = disinfestation facility’, that is to say, precisely in the Zentralsauna. [cf. Fig. 31, 205 ] But for what reason does the invoice have as its subject: ‘Auschwitz-crematorium’? This heading has an obvious relationship to the aforesaid Topf ‘itemiza- tion’ of April 13, 1943, concerning ‘2 Topf disinfestation heaters for Crema II’ which were then installed in the Zentralsauna. In any case, the two documents establish the correlation crematorium–disinfestation and portray the expression of a plan or at least of a Zentralbauleitung inten- tion to combine cremation and disinf estation within the same edifice.” Since, as shown in chapter 5.2.2., the installation of hygiene cen- ters with showers, disinfestation, undressing and dressing rooms and adjacent crematoria is not at all unusual, the “ traces ” adduced by Pres- sac and van Pelt may be seen to have been incorrectly interpreted.   204 Inventory of the delivery negotiations relating to the “ Desinfektions- und Entwesunsanlage ” (Zentralsauna) of 22.

A USCHWITZ 105 ted. 211 Based on the ruins, it must be possible even today, to establish whether the door was possibly walled in to make it narrower and whether there are any traces of door frames. Excavations would be necessary to determine this. The engineers Nowak and Rademacher have shown that the ‘gas- tight’ doors manufactured at Auschwitz by inmates from wooden planks could not have been gas-tight in a technical sense, the planks did not close hermetically, the fittings were simply fastened through the wood by means of bolts, and the seals consisted of felt strips. 212 One has to consider that a hypothetical homicidal ‘gas chamber’ door would have to open outwards— a door opening inwards would be blocked by inmate bodies lying in front of the door. Such doors would require an especially stable arrangement as the locks and hinges would have to be capable of resisting the pressure of hundreds of panicking people. The pressure exerted by such masses of people becomes appar- ent when one recalls the photographs of panicky spectators at foot- ball/soccer matches. Separating fen ces and partitions between individ- ual spectator blocks are commonly trampled down like mere blades of grass in such situations. In any case, a simple wooden door, rendered provisionally gas-tight, as has been found in Auschwitz, a photograph of which is reproduced by Pressac in his book (see Fig. 33), 213 could never have resisted such pressure. The camp administration could actually have ordered solid, tech- nically gas-tight steel doors (air-raid shelter doors, Fig. 34) since they were offered such doors but it can be proven that they did not order them. One must assume that they had no serious need for them. 212 In this context, a comparison of the flimsy wooden doors as found in Auschwitz (used for delousing purposes only) with technically gas tight, massive iron doors as used for executions in U.S. homicidal gas chambers is revealing, compare Fig. 33 with Fig. 5 (page 24).

This cellar was actually used as an air-raid shelter for inmates as sug- gested by a few eyewitness testimonies. 214 This would also explain other more minor ‘traces’ which cannot be discussed here. Samuel Crowell has shown in several articles the extent to which the SS actu- ally built air-raid shelter installations not only for themselves but also for the camp inmates. 215 Correct conclusions 2: The change in orientation of the doors was probably caused by the design of this morgue’s ventilation system. Since the air inlet of this system had a higher resistance than the outlet (see next chapter), a considerable subpressure was caused in morgue 1, constantly sucking air in from the rest of the building. This is a desired effect for a morgue where many corpses had to be stored, so that un- pleasant smells would not reach other parts of the building. A double door opening to the side with a lower pressure (inside morgue 1) would open automatically, whereas a door opening to the side of higher pressure closes automatically.   214 Miklos Nyiszli’s book Auschwitz: A Doctor’s Eyewitness Account , Arcade Publishing, New York 1993, alleges, on p. 128, that the inmates t ook refuge in the gas chamber during air raids. Martin Gilbert’s Auschwitz and the Allies (Henry Holt & Co., New York 1981), p. 309, con- tains the testimony of a female survivor, accord ing to which she, together with many other female arriving inmates, was led to a darkened room to remain there during an air raid. What is most interesting about this testimony is the description of the manner in which some of the women became hysterical during the air raid and believed that they were inhaling poison gas. Another conclusion which could be drawn from this testimony is that the SS were concerned with protecting their inmates from air raids, and that there must have existed several such air raid shelters at Birkenau, which must have b een gas-tight, that however remained entirely un- noticed and unstudied (from: S.

A USCHWITZ 107 5.4.1.2.4. Ventilation Installations Fact: All rooms in crematoria II and III were equipped with effi- cient ventilation installations. 216 Incorrect conclusion: Morgues 1 of crematoria II and III were converted into homicidal ‘gas cham bers’ equipped with installations for the intended purpose of evacuating poison gases. 217 Correct conclusion: It is in fact inconceivable that a large morgue without windows and with only one door filled with innumerable bod- ies of the victims of epidemic disease would not be equipped with a ventilation installation. The efficiency of the ventilation, however, proves that these installations were designed for typical morgues. 218 The efficiency of the blowers may be seen from the invoices sent to the Zentralbauleitung by the Topf corporation after installation of the sys- tems. 219 According to the invoices, both morgues #1, i.e. , the alleged ‘gas chambers’ (in the invoice designated as the “ B-room ”), were each equipped with a 4,800 m 3 /h intake and outlet blower, 220 while for the “ L-room ” (the so-called “ undressing room ”) only one outlet blower was installed, with a capacity of 10,000 m 3 /h. 221   216 The ventilation ducts of morgue 1 are visibl e in the plans published by J.-C.

The output data relate to a back-pressure of 40 mm water column. The increment calculati ons for estimating the venti- lation shaft resistances in crematoria II & III according to engineering handbooks have shown that the back pressure to be expected would probably have b een higher (in the region of 50-60 mm water columns), due, particularly, to the pr imitive lids with many small holes covering the ventilation slit. Two blowers were probably us ed for this reason. Personal communication from Hans Lamker, a certified engineer. 221 J.-C.

Does anybody seriously believe that, at the end of May 1943, i.e. , two months after the beginning of the alleged mass murders, it was assumed that the ‘g as chambers’ would need less venti- lation than the undressing rooms, or even less than the dissecting rooms, laying out rooms and wash rooms, the ventilation efficiency of which were even greater—approximately 13 1 / 3 air exchanges per hour? Wilhem Heepke’s classic work on the construction of crematoria states that a morgue requires a minimum of 5 air exchanges per hour and 10 during intensive use. 222 Thus it is clear that the ventilation in- stallations provided for the morgues we re designed, in terms of orders of magnitude, for morgues in intensive use or for morgues containing the bodies of epidemic disease victims. For comparison: Zyklon B dis- infestation chambers with circulating air systems were equipped with 72 air exchanges per hour. 223 Furthermore, it should be mentioned that the original plans for a new crematorium in the main camp from 1941—a time when even Pressac admits that the SS had no criminal intentions—provided for 17(!) air exchanges per hour for the dissect- ing room(!) and the morgues. 224 This exchange rate is considerably higher than what was later realized for all rooms of crematoria II and III, including the alleged ‘gas chambers’. Thus, on the way from bene- ficial planning to (allegedly sinist er) construction, the air exchange rates had been drastically reduced (p robably in order to reduce costs). Does anybody seriously believe, the SS would have lowered the venti- lation capacity when changing the designation of a morgue from a beneficial use to a homicidal ‘gas chamber’, instead of increasing it? This is thus the final refutation of any argument on the alleged criminal characteristics of the ventilation installations in these crematoria. 5.4.1.2.5.

Crematoria II and III were converted into homicidal ‘gas chambers’, (intended to be) equipped with a heating system so that ‘the gas would work more rapidly’. It was necessary to eliminate the plumbing system in the morgue because panic-stricken inmates would have damaged the pipes. 226 Correct conclusion: According to expert literature, morgues do in- deed need some kind of heating equipment, because corpses must be protected from the effects of frost and freezing temperatures in win- ter. 227 Hence, under normal operation, morgues would have been equipped with heating devices, but the initial plans to equip the morgues in Auschwitz with heaters were cancelled, 228 rendering the argument irrelevant. Regarding the removal of the water pipes, a ‘non- criminal’ explanation follows logically: Since no heating was ever in- stalled in these morgues, there was a danger that the water pipes would have burst in freezing temperatures due to the lack of any heating. In order to prevent burst pipes and a subsequent flooding of the morgues, the pipes had to be removed. 5.4.1.2.6. “ Cremation with Simultaneous Special Treatment ” Fact: With regards to the “ Electrical supply and installation of the concentration camp and prisoner of war camp ” the documentary note (“ Aktenvermerk ”) of the Auschwitz Zentralbauleitung of January 29, 1943, states: 229 “This putting into operation [of crematorium II] can however only extend to restricted use of the ava ilable machines (in which case crema- tion with simultaneous special treatment [original: “ Sonderbehandlung ”] will be made possible) since the [electrical] supply leading to the crema-   225 Pre-heating: J.-C.

Further- more, on January 29, 1943, the ventilation installation for the morgue had not yet even been delivered, let alone installed and put into opera- tion. Commencement of construction was not anticipated before Feb- ruary 10. 231 Installation was only charged to the account on February 22, 1943. 232 Therefore, the “ available machines ” on January 1, 1943, in no way included the morgue ven tilation installations. Actually, the concept “ special treatment ” in this connection has no ‘criminal’ sig- nificance at all, as W. Stromberger 104 and recently C. Mattogno have pointed out: 233 “By considering the historical context—a typhus epidemic increase so dangerous in 1942 as to induce [...] Major General of the Waffen SS Glücks to command on February 8, 1943, the complete quarantine of the camp [234] —the meaning of the term ‘ special treatment ’ in the memoran- dum of January 29, 1943, could only be an extension of its hygienic- sanitary meaning which emerges from other documents. 235 That is, from the hygienic-sanitary point of view, the ‘ existing machines ’ would have guaranteed proper cremation with limited capacity. This is confirmed by a document going back a few weeks. On Janu- ary 13, 1943, Bischoff wrote a letter to the firm Deutsche Ausrüs- tungswerke in Auschwitz with the subject ‘ Fulfillment of carpentry jobs for the building planning room .’ In this document, Bischoff complained about the delay in receiving doors ‘ for crematorium I in the KGL ’, ex-   230 Robert van Pelt, Deborah Dwork, op. cit.

Why then should the Zentralbauleitung , which was not competent in this matter, in addition to being unau- thorized, have issued the order for the procurement of HCN resi- due detection devices in 1943? – In addition to crematorium ovens, the Topf corporation also pro- duced hot air disinfestation ovens, as well as silo fumigation in- stallations which were, howev er, not operated with HCN. 241 Why then should the heating technician Jährling, a civilian engineer, order devices of which he had no knowledge from a firm which obviously did not even know the supplier of the devices when the health service of Auschwitz camp had already been regularly sup- plied with these devices by the Tesch und Stabenow corporations for two years and therefore knew the supplier?

The alternating alignment, however, would contradict the argument that the Zyklon B introduction columns were aligned behind the concrete s upport pillars in order to conceal them so that the entering victims would not become suspicious. As a matter of fact, no introduction column could have been hidden behind a concrete pillar, because this woul d have necessitated the opening of a hole not only through the reinforced c oncrete roof, but also through the massive longitudinal support beam, see Fig. 26, which would have compromised the stability of the entir e morgue.

So what would the vic- tims locked into the cellar have done to the wire mesh columns de- scribed by the eyewitnesses? If these columns actually existed, their outer framework would have to have been of solid steel, but certainly not of fragile wire mesh construction. 3. These columns would, in addition, have had to have been sol- idly anchored in the concrete ceiling, the floor, and the concrete pillars. But since solid anchoring dowels did not yet exist at that time, hoop irons would have been cast into the concrete during the construction of the cellar, spread out to a ‘dovetail’ inside the concrete. 257 If carried out after completion of the building, holes would have been chiseled into the concrete, and the hoop irons would have been cast in cement filling these holes, see Fig. 47. In both cases, a removal of such cast-in hoop irons would have been impossible. All one could do is cut them off with a saw or a welding torch. 258 Hence, if any introduction device was ever installed in these morgues, traces of such hoop irons must still be present. 4.

Using such crude holes would truly be an incredibly stupid piece of bungling. But there is more. In the opening shown in Fig. 46 the reinforce- ment rods were only separated and bent back. They possess their full length even today. One could bend them back again and weld them back together with their stumps, which are also visible to the left of the photograph (covered with snow). 262 Nor is there any trace of rein- forcement rods running in a wreath-like pattern around the hole. This hole, therefore, can never have been used as an introduction hole; it was never finished. And what makes matters worse: this is still the ‘best’ of all holes and cracks in this roof in existence today. All others are even more irregular and filled with reinforcement rods. No apparatus, using the technology available at that time, could be anchored in such crudely pierced, unplastered holes, from which the reinforcement rods were not even removed; therefore, no gas introduc- tion device could ever have been firmly installed, let alone sealed from the exterior. This means that the entire environment including the sup- posed perpetrators would have been endangered by the gas streaming out of the opening.

Although the ex- plosion pressure in the oven room, on an even level with the ground, could turn aside in all directions, and the roof remains relatively intact to the attic, three of the five oven room ventilation holes, cleanly cast and reinforced in the concrete roof, were completely destroyed. In the case of two of the other holes, clearly visible cracks formed at the cor- ners, visible in the photos reproduced by Pressac. 255 In the morgues of crematoria II and III, the explosion pressure could only turn upwards, causing their roofs to be much more seriously damaged than the roof of the oven room.

On the spot, one furthermore recognizes the arbitrary ar- rangement of this hole in a location at which the roof of the morgue is undamaged.

The chisel marks on the edge of the hole in Fig. 44 are so similar to those in Fig. 46 that it must be assumed that both holes have the same history. 263 There were therefore no holes in the ceilings of these rooms through which the poison gas preparation could be introduced by means of wire mesh pillars” or otherwise, as described by eyewit- nesses. Prof. van Pelt remarked accurately in this regard: 264 “Today, these four small holes that connected the wire-mesh col- umns and the chimneys [on the roof of morgue 1, crematorium II] cannot be observed in the ruined remains of the concrete slab. Yet does this mean they were never there?” An interesting question, which the professor of architectural his- tory answers as follows:   263 Carlo Mattogno, op. cit. (note 262), has shown that the size of this hole actually increased over the years, probably because the Auschwitz Museum wants to give it a more regular, rec- tangular shape. 264 Pelt Report , op. cit.

But at least Prof. van Pelt believes that the SS administration acted logically, in that they allegedly attempted to wipe away all trace of their alleged crime. But does van Pelt really be- lieve that it would have made more sense to fill up the holes with con- crete instead of removing the entire roof of the ‘gas chamber’, as was done with the roofs of morgues 2, the “ undressing room ”? An Allied air photo taken on December 21, 1944, shows that the roof of the other morgue, which is not alleged to have been used to commit any mur- ders, was completely removed. 265 Obviously the whole matter makes no sense. To believe van Pelt, we must believe, that the SS arbitrarily created architectural relics to confuse later tourists and Holocaust re- searchers instead of destroying the r oof entirely, as in the case of the undressing room. This seems too absurd to be taken seriously. But if van Pelt had the most rudimentary knowledge of architec- ture, he would know that it is impossible to remove holes measuring 70 × 70 cm (that is almost half a square meter!) from a concrete roof without leaving clearly visible traces . Actually, however, there are no traces of openings in the roof later closed with concrete. In addition, concrete patches fille d in later would have flown out of these holes like corks out of a shaken champagne bottle during an explosion, thus making the holes just as visible as they were before. On closer inspection, Prof. van Pelts allegation turns out to be not only demonstrably wrong, but utterly absurd. But at least Prof. van Pelt agrees with the revisionists that there are no remains of these alleged holes. In remarking that there are no such traces, van Pelt has in fact proven that there were never any holes in the ceiling of this room, and, c onsequently, no Zyklon B introduction holes of any nature whatever, and, consequently, no introduction of any poisonous substances whatever in the manner described by the ‘eyewitnesses’.

Only our conclusions are somewhat divergent. At this point, I would like to introduce a witness who contacted David Irving by e-mail after conclusion of Mr. Irving’s legal proceed- ings against Deborah Lipstadt in May 2000. He is an engineer named Barford; his colleagues are assisting in the conservation and restoration of the camp for the Auschwitz Museu m administration. He informed David Irving that, during his trial, investigations were made in com- plete secrecy at Auschwitz with rega rds to the mystery of the holes, and then remarked: “ [W] hat happened to their [the Auschwitz Museum’s] tests on the roof of Crema II mentioned in the attachment. Did they find the Zyklon B holes or not? Did they report those results to Lipstadt’s lawyers, and when! [...] As you can guess, despite my belief that you and the Revisionists are wrong, and despite spending half an hour examining the collapsed roof of the underground gas chamber of cr ematorium II from different angles, I found no evidence of the four holes that the eye-witnesses say were there [...] . Secondly several areas of the slabs are covered in small rubble from an outer layer of concrete which was fractured by the blast. Now I would have expected these fragments to have fallen through the holes, if they were there, into the void beneath. [...] I remain puzzled by the lack of physical evidence for these holes.” In early 2000, Charles D. Provan distributed a paper claiming he had located the missing holes in the roof of morgue 1 of crematorium II. 266 What Provan did, however, was simply to declare those cracks as ‘holes’, which were caused by the concrete support pillars piercing through the collapsing roof and cracks caused by the roof bending over the longitudinal beam. All holes described by Provan are full of rein-   266 “ No Holes? No Holocaust?

Whatever this handwritten entry rea lly refers to, one thing is clear: it does not support Kula’s claim of the existence of complex Zyklon B introduction devices(!) in morgue 1(!) of the crematoria II and III. Furthermore, M.

The nurses told me that the corpses were cr acked, and the skin came off.” As will be shown in chapter 7., victims of Zyklon B gassings aren’t greenish (they are pinkish-reddish), and there is no reason for the corpses to crack and for their skin to come off.

Pressac, op. cit. (note 67), pp. 276, 291, 329, 369. The use of the air intake fan to introduce HCN w ould have lead to some HCN losses through the air exhaust chimney already during the gassing, thus endangering anybody close to those cre- matoria, but certainly not more than would ha ve been the case when all the HCN had to be removed after the end of a hypothetical gassing, so this would not be an argument against this"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"5. A USCHWITZ 133  Also, one could have drastically increased the evaporation rate of the Zyklon B in this basket even further, hence accelerating the execution procedure. All that would have been required was to al- ter an idea the Topf engineers had in early March 1943. When fac- ing cooling problems of the cremation furnaces’ forced draught blowers, the Topf engineers sugg ested to use the excess heat pro- duced by these engines to pre-heat the morgue. The only construc- tional change needed for this was to redirect this excess heat into the morgue’s air intake duct. 275 Though the forced draught blowers overheated and were damaged shortly thereafter, 228 it would have been easy to construct a short air duct from the furnace chimney to the air intake duct of morgue 1 instead. In this way, warm air com- ing from the crematory ovens would have been redirected over the Zyklon B basket into morgue 1, supplying this room with warm air enriched with HCN. I assume the point I am making is clear: there were all sorts of cheaper and less complicated soluti ons available than suggested by Michal Kula. His solution is simply impracticable and is an insult to every engineer’s and architect’s intelligence—naturally bearing in mind the fact that the ruins of crematorium II clearly prove that no such columns were ever installed anyway. 5.4.1.2.9.

The alleged homicidal ‘gas chambers’ are therefore refuted upon the grounds of building engineering.

An analysis of this air photo proves that the spots visible have no spatial height, have an irregular shape, an incorrect size (much too long and wide), and ir- regular directions different from real shadows; these spots can therefore neither be shadows of any objects, nor can they be the legendary Zyklon B introduction stacks. The filling stacks are visible on a ground photo of crematorium II. These three objects are only visible on one photo- graph; on others they are missing. They stand closely together, have different dimensions and irregular alignment. Introduction stacks would have the same size, a regular alignment and evenly distributed over the roof. The objects do not accord with the holes actually found, either in location or in number. For planned introduction holes, cleanly cast and reinforced holes with concrete/brick stacks protruding over the layer of soil laying on this roof would have to be ex- pected. The only two holes deserving this name clearly show chisel marks; the concrete structure was destroyed at a later time; there are no smooth, cast concrete edges and surfaces, no stack-like elevation to prevent the entry of rain water and soil into the hole. All other cracks and openings are highly irregular, filled with reinforcements rods, and obviously caused by the collapsing roof being pierced by pillars and bent over the longitudinal beam. For holes chiseled in, the reinforcement rods would have to be re- moved, the edges pol- ished off, and a protrud- ing stack built. Such holes would be severely damaged by an explo- sion. In all cases the reinforcement rods still project into the holes; in one case, these were only cut through and bent back. The edges of all holes and cracks were not plastered; the tar insulation is openly visible; there is no trace of any stacks added. The ‘best’ of these holes is in an area unaffected by the explosion that blew up this morgue, proving that this hole was chis- eled in after the war. The installation of intro- duction devices running from the ceiling to the floor requires panic- proof fixtures, like mas- sive rawl-plugs and hoop irons with dovetails No trace of such fixtures can be found anywhere, hence no such devices were ever installed.

Crematoria IV and V Figure 56 shows the ground plan of crematorium IV and mirror- symmetrically that of crematorium V. 276 Based on cost considerations, these buildings, planned and begun later, were constructed in a simpler manner than crematoria II and III. Due to low quality materials, the crematorium ovens of both crematoria broke down shortly after the putting into operation of the installati on. They were not repaired due to crematorium over-capacity. There are few documents as well as con- tradictory and, to some extent, incredible eyewitness testimonies relat- ing to these installations, which, according to Pressac, must be consid- ered the least well-known: 277 “ [...] the least known of the instruments of extermination [...] a comparison of such testimonies reveals inconsistencies.” These crematoria were planned starting in the summer of 1942, built until early 1943.

No ventilation installation is known to have existed. Pressac assumes ventilation by natural con- vection. 279 Franciszek Piper, Director of the Auschwitz Museum agrees: 164 “There were plans for mechanica l ventilation of the Zyklon B, but these were not put into effect. Evac uation of the gas was instead achieved by convection, that is, by merely opening the doors.” Pressac alleges the later incorporation of a door in the corridor for natural ventilation support, but without proving it. 280 Since it would hardly have been any more expensive for the SS to provide for me- chanical ventilation in these rooms, and since this solution would have been considerably more effective, Pressac’s argument of the installa- tion of a door for ventilation can be rejected as unrealistic. It is also obvious that the morgue and oven room possessed ventilation chim- neys. The rooms which purportedly served as ‘gas chambers,’ how- ever, are the only rooms which, apart from the coke room and doctor’s office, 281 possessed no ventilation chimney! According to an older Pressac publication, 282 these ‘gas chambers’ were not planned and built as such either, which he bases, among other things, on the fact that the absence of a ventilation installation would have led to a need to evacuate the entire building for many hours dur- ing a gassing. 283 It is, in fact, inconceivable for a gas chamber not to   277 J.-C.

In his new book, Pressac leaves these arguments unchanged. 284 Since the mass extermination of th e Jews was supposed to have been already fully underway—particularly, in farmhouses I and II—when crematoria IV and V were being planne d, it is, of course, absurd to be- lieve that these installations could have been incorrectly designed and built. Today, therefore, Pressac assumes a “ criminal planning” of the crematoria. 285 Proof of such criminality is alleged to have been sup- plied by various documents, mentioning the “ installation of gas-tight [sic] windows” , “ pouring concrete floor in gas chamber”, and re- peated mentions of gas-tight doors in various connections. 286 As already shown in the chapter on the disinfestation of personal effects, the German word “ Gaskammer” (gas chamber) was the desig- nation commonly used at that time for the disinfestation of personal effects. The combination of crematoria and disinfestation installations in one and the same building was very common practice at that time. 287 Indications have since been found leading to the inference that it was initially planned to use the rooms referred to in some documents as “ gas chambers ” for disinfestation purposes. One factor in favor of this hypothesis, for example, is that the ovens for the heating of these rooms had to be heated from the hallway, and that the lamps planned for installation in these rooms had be to explosion-proof, and installed in a recess. 288 In the case of crematoria IV and V, one must assume that the rooms in question here were inte nded for disinfestation purposes, but never completed for this purpose, le t alone used. In any case, there is no evidence that ventilation systems absolutely necessary for the use of HCN were ever installed. 289 The reason for this may lie in the fact that   284 J.-C. Pressac, op. cit.

W. Rademacher has remarked that Pressac personally quotes a document by means of which “ 210 Gas door anchorings ” were or- dered in Auschwitz. This document indicates that the term gas-tight (“ gasdicht ”) does not necessarily constitute a reference to execution of disinfestation chambers, since it has never been claimed that there was a need for roughly one hundred doors for homicidal ‘gas chambers’ at Auschwitz. 290 It is entirely possible that all doors and windows were designated as ‘gas tight’ if they were equipped with felt insulation and were, therefore, sealed off against air currents, a characteristic not at all common in windows for inmate barracks in a concentration camp. 291 Pressac himself provides yet another item of proof that the term ‘gas chamber’ has no criminal si gnificance in Auschwitz documents. One document states: “ 1 key for gas chamber ”. Since all ‘gas tight’ doors found at Auschwitz, as well as all surviving photographs of such doors, show that these doors had no locks, this document must refer to a door for another type of room, such as a room for the storage of Zyk- lon B, which truly required storage under lock and key. 292 The walls of crematoria IV and V, which were built entirely above ground, were of simple brick masonr y. After they were blown up, both buildings were demolished to th eir foundation walls and concrete foundations. The foundation wall of crematorium V, which is ap- proximately 1 m high, is supposed to have been rebuilt. 293 The founda- tion wall of crematorium IV, which is approximately 50 cm high, is also supposed to have been rebuilt out of other rubble at a later time. 56 Even these ruins can still speak to us , even if, in this case, only the concrete foundations are authentic, since everything else is probably not authentic.

A U-shaped, solid steel grid construction anchored in the floor and in the masonry of the walls with steel hoop anchors spread out into dovetails would have been necessary to keep the victims on the inside at arm’s length from the hatches.

Farmhouses 1 and 2 According to eyewitness accounts, there are supposed to have been two farmhouses (sometimes referred to as bunkers 1 and 2), lo- cated west-north west of the Birk enau camp, which were converted into homicidal ‘gas chambers’. Their location and construction are not, however, exactly described. Pressac mentions contradictory eyewitness reports in this regard. 294 Relating to the testimony of P.

Only on air photos made during the winter of 1944/1945, a few mass graves can be seen west of crematorium III— probably for the victims of the chaotic circumstances in the camp after the Germans started to shut down and dismantle the equipment in fall of 1944 during their withdrawal. 303 Recently discovered documents prove that one of these farm- houses actually existed—and was used for disinfestation. The SS, in particular, was prohibited from carrying on the disinfestation of per- sonal effects with Zyklon B inside the camp whenever there was a safety risk. The conversion of a farmhouse, which was located outside the camp, and whose utilization as provisional HCN disinfestation in- stallations would not have involved any safety risk for the camp itself, could have resulted from this difficu lt situation.

Background: Eyewitness Accounts J.-C. Pressac quotes various eyewitnesses claiming that due to the restricted capacity of the Auschwitz crematoria, a large portion of the bodies of the victims of homicidal mass gassing were cremated in open-air pits. These pits were allegedly located north of crematorium V as well as close to the farmhouses (bunkers) 1 and 2. The size of these pits is described as roughly 20-60 m long, 3-7 m wide, and 1.5 to 3 m deep. 307 5.4.4.2. The Ground Water Table in Birkenau In his expert report, Fredrick Leuchter pointed out that due to the high ground water table he found in Birkenau in 1988, it would have been impossible to dig deep pits and to light and maintain a fire in them. 26 The reason for the high ground water table is that the Birkenau camp lies in the immediate vicinity of the confluence of the Sola river into the Vistula river. A few hundred meters away from the camp one finds today swampy meadows. Leuchter, however, did not investigate the important question of whether the ground water table was similarly high in 1942-1944, when the events attested to by the w itnesses took place. It has been pointed out that the Birkenau camp had a sophisticated grid work of drainage canals which lowered the ground water table. 308 This drainage system is still functioning fairly well to this day. Whereas the ground water table around the camp is basically right at the surface, it is today low- ered to 60 to 70 cm under the surface within the camp, obvious, for example, from Figure 57. The photo was taken on August 15, 1991, during a long period of drought. It show s a construction trench in front of the Zentralsauna located in the western part of the camp.

There are two pieces of circumstantial evidence indicating that the water table was not much different then than it is today. The first evidence is the well known small pond in the vicinity of crema- torium IV, which is supposed to have ex- isted the same way dur- ing the war. If the drainage system had lowered the water table by several meters, the pond next to cremato- rium IV, contrary to many witness state- ments, would have dried up. This proves the unchanged water table from then until now. The second evi- dence is the subterra- nean location of the morgues of crematoriums II and III, as well as some of the building sections of the Zentralsauna . They all were con- structed by insulating the buildings’ basements from intruding water with a waterproof layer of tar, whic h indicates that there was a need to protect against such water in the fi rst place. Also, since the drainage ditches in the camp are only 1 to 1.5 meters deep, they could not have lowered the water table to less than one meter. This maximum value, though, can only be achieved in the immediate vicinity of the ditches.

A USCHWITZ 143 macher on the one hand 182 and Carlo Mattogno on the other hand 309 have shown, with a vast amount of contemporary German documents dealing with the camp authorities’ problems caused by the high water table, that between the end of 1941 and middle of 1944, the water table in Birkenau in general and outside the camp perimeter in particular was very high, coming close or even reaching the surface and turning the entire area into a swampy region. All three authors showed that construction on buildings with basements was possible only by perma- nently pumping off ground water, and Mattogno even found docu- ments expressively forbidding the digging of pits for outhouse latrines, because this would contaminate the drinking water of the entire Auschwitz region. Mass incinerations of corpses in deep pits, of course, would have contaminated the drinking water as well, hence would never have been permitted. 5.4.4.3. Open-Air Incineration in Pits In general, it is of course possible to burn corpses in open-air pits, though it certainly takes more time and fuel than any cremation in a crematorium, and it also leaves many more traces due to incomplete combustion. In 1999, Dr. Myroslaw Dragan conducted an experimental incineration of an 80 lb. deer in a pit roughly 1 m deep, 70 cm wide, and 1.2 m long. This incineration with a relatively small amount of wood lasted some 4-5 hours and was almost completely successful. 310 Dr. Dragan found out that for open-air incinerations, small, narrow holes are advantageous over large, wide holes or, even worse, crema- tions on ground level, since the soil walls of a pit act like the walls of a crematorium oven, storing and reflecting a great deal of the heat pro- duced by the fire—provided that the soil has a considerable amount of clay stabilizing the wall of the pit, and, of course, that no ground water flows into the pit and extinguishes the fire. The situation in Birkenau, however, was drastically different from that. Not only did the witnesses claim that those pits were very wide,   309 “‘ Verbrennungsgruben’ und Grundwasserstand in Birkenau ”, VffG 6(4) (2002), pp. 421-424 (online: www.vho.org/ VffG/2002/4/Ma ttogno421-424.html); Engl.: “ ‘Incineration Pits’ and Ground Water Level in Birkenau ”, The Revisionist , 1(1) (2003), pp. 13-16 (online: www.vho.org/tr/2003/1/ Mattogno13-16.html). 310 Only small pieces of the skull were left over wh ich were located in a co rner of the pit.

It is known that in Birkenau the corpses which had accumulated during the typhus epidemic of the summer of 1942 were first buried in mass graves. Due to the danger of the contamination of the ground wa- ter, however, they had to be exhumed in the spring of 1943. Since the new cremation facilities still were not capable of functioning at that time, it is possible that at least a portion of the corpses were burned on funeral pyres.

Indeed, one can unearth in excava tions west of the Birkenau camp ashes and bone splinters (whether from humans or cattle remains open) to the depth of several decimeters, intensively mixed with all kinds of refuse (glass and porcelain shards, slag, bits of iron, etc.). Apparently this place served as a rubbish heap for the camp under German admini- stration and/or after the war under Polish administration. In his detailed study of aerial photos of the Birkenau camp made by the allied surveillance planes, J.C. Ball has revealed that at no point in time in the summer and autumn of 1944 in the camp or in its envi- rons were large incineration pits—and fuel stockpiles necessary for that—to be seen, let alone flames and smoke, as they are repeatedly attested to. 311 He did, however, locate the places were mass graves had existed (see Fig. 58). 303 5.5. Construction Conclusions Even the most primitive temporary disinfestation installations— whether in the initial period of the life of Auschwitz camp or else- where—were always equipped with a ventilation and heating system, the last being, of course, useful but not absolutely necessary. But no room possessing no ventilation system need even be seriously consid- ered as a room for fumigation with poisonous gases, whether for lice or human beings. Homicidal ‘gas chambers’ must furthermore be equipped, apart from the entry doors, with an opening for the introduc- tion of the poison gas material from the outside; this is not absolutely necessary for disinfestation installations, but is nevertheless useful. It must be concluded, therefore, that no installation possessing neither a poison gas introduction device from the outside, nor any possibility of ventilation, can be taken seriously as a homicidal ‘gas chamber’. If one considers the rooms discussed above in a summary manner, the results are shown in Table 2. Not taken into consideration in the above, among other things, is the fact that hypothetical homicidal ‘gas chambers’ would have to be escape-proof, that their equipment had to be panic-proof, that their ventilation would have to be effi cient enough for homicidal purposes,   311 J.C.

Although the literature is generally unanimous as to the equipment of the rooms in crematoria IV and V, the information is, to a certain extent, speculative, due to the lack of documents and material evi- dence. The same is true for the in formation relating to the farmhouses, on which there are practically no documents available. Fortunately, it is precisely the one ‘gas chamber’ in which the largest number of people was allege dly killed by poison gas during the Third Reich which has remained almost entirely intact: morgue 1 of crematorium II. Contrary to all eyewitness testimony, this cellar, dur- ing the period of its operation, possessed no Zyklon B introduction holes in the roof. It is only logical and consequent to transfer these conclusions also to the mirror-symmetrically built, but otherwise iden- tical crematorium III, even though we do not possess any physical evi- dence for this due to the almost complete destruction of the roof of its morgue 1. If this is so, those rooms cannot have been used as locations for mass homicide using poison gas, as alleged by witnesses. When one considers the technical circumstances prevailing in and around Auschwitz, in the broadest sense, one becomes aware of the absurdity of the entire claim of homicidal mass gassings. The camp management was fully aware of the methods and technical precondi- tions for Zyklon B disinfestation, and was even informed as to the lat- est developments in the related technology. 143 But instead of using these methods, it allegedly had recourse, for mass gassing purposes, to extremely crude methods, particularly where bunkers I and II, and, Table 2: Equipment and suitability of actual or alleged ‘gas chambers’ Equipment/ Suitability Building Poison gas introduction Heating Ventilation Suitability as disinfestation chamber Suitability as execution chamber Disinfestation cham- bers { z z yes if with means of introduction Crematorium I × × { hardly/perhaps no Crematoria II and III × × z perhaps no Crematoria IV and V z z × hardly hardly Farmhouses I and II { × / { × / { hardly/perhaps no z = present or possible; { = possibly present; × = not present"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"5.

Considering these facts, it can not r eally come as a surprise that fi- nally even the mainstream historians and media are taking notice of them: In May 2002, Fritjof Meyer, a senior editor at Germany’s larg- est, left-wing weekly magazine Der Spiegel , stated in an article that documents and witness statements re garding the alleged gas chambers in the crematoria II and III of Birkenau “rather indicate that attempts were made in March and April of 1943 to use the mortuary cellars for mass murder in the early summer of 1943. Apparently, the tests were not successful [...] The actually commit- ted genocide probably took place mainly in the two converted farm- houses outside of the camp.” 312 In other words: there is a tendency to abandon those locations which Prof. Dr. R. van Pelt called “ the absolute center ” in the “ geo- graphy of atrocities ” (see page 91), or even the Birkenau crematoria altogether, since, according to Meyer the genocide is now supposed to have taken place mainly in those ominous farmhouses or bunkers of which we possess hardly any documentary evidence. Following Meyer, the final destruction of the corpses of the alleged victims of mass murder is now supposed to have happened almost exclusively by means of open-air incinerations in deep pits. However, all claims made regardi ng the alleged open-air incineration of corpses in deep pits are obvious ly untrue because no traces of such incinerations can be found on contemporary air-photos, and because the high water table in Birkenau would have prevented the maintenance of fires in deep pits.

Formation and Stability of Iron Blue 6.1. Introduction Hundreds of thousands of people are claimed to have been killed in the alleged Auschwitz ‘gas chambers’ by hydrogen cyanide in the form of the product Zyklon B ® . The question which now arises is the following: could this poisonous gas leave chemical traces, which could perhaps be detected in these a lleged chemical slaughterhouses? If hydrogen cyanide (HCN), the reactive compound in Zyklon B, were only bound to the walls by adsorption (adhesion), 313 there would not be any detectable residues today anymore, due to the volatility of hydrogen cyanide (boiling point: 25.7°C); all the hydrogen cyanide involved would long since have evaporated. But if one assumes that the hydrogen cyanide, during fumigation, would combine with certain materials in the masonry to create other, considerably more stable compounds, then one might anticipate the possible existence of chemical residues even today. The reaction products of interest to us in this respect are the salts of hydrogen cyanide, called cyanides, 314 in particular, the iron cyanide group, formed by a compound of iron and cyanide. Iron occurs univer- sally in nature. It is iron which giv es brick its red color, sand its ochre color, and clay its color ranging from yellowish to reddish-brown. More precisely, we are speaking of iron oxide, popularly known as ‘rust’. Basically, all walls consist of at least 1% rust, as a result of sand, gravel, clay, and cement, of which the wall is constructed. The iron cyanides have long been known for their extraordinary stability, one of them having achieved particular fame as one of the most commonly used blue pigments during the last three centuries:   313 A b sorption and A d sorption are not the same! A b sorption is the incorporation (sometimes even consumption) of a matter into a medium (light is absorbed/consumed by a pigment, gas is ab- sorbed/dissolves in to a liquid), whereas A d sorption is the adhesion of matter onto a—usually solid—surface (dust on furniture, steam on windscreen, vapours on any solid surface...); Adsorption is further subdivided in chemisorption , in which the matter is bound to a surface by chemical bonds, and physisorption , in which the bonding is only a physical effect. The transition between both is fluent. 314 For simplicity’s sake, ‘cyanide’ is frequently understood to mean only the anionic part of the cyanide salts, the cyanide ion, CN – ."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 152 Iron Blue, also often referred to as Prussian Blue. 315 6.2. Instances of Damages to Buildings Chapter 1.3. contained a discussion of an instance of damage to a church which occurred in 1976 in Bavaria, Germany. In the many hun- dreds of thousands of fumigations which have been carried out since 1920, there cannot, as a rule, have been any complications, otherwise the procedure would have been very rapidly abandoned. The case in question was, therefore, an excepti on. But what exactly was it that made this church an exception? Different scenery. 1939-1945. In the camps of the Third Reich, hundreds of thousands of people—Jews, political prisoners, criminals, ‘anti-socials,’ and prisoners of war—were crammed together. To stem the raging epidemics, attempts were made, not always with great suc- cess, to kill the carriers of disease, pa rticularly head lice. This was done in particular with hydrogen cyanide, Zyklon B. This was some- times done in chambers professionally designed for such purposes, sometimes ordinary rooms were equipped for such purposes in an aux- iliary manner, and provisionally used for disinfestation. Many of the camps in the Third Reich were leveled at the end of the war or after- wards; in other camps the existing buildings were torn down and the buildings materials used for the rec onstruction of the ruined cities. A few buildings, however, remain intact today. The interiors of these buildings look as in Fig. 59-66 (see also the color picture section in the middle of this book). From the remarks of a Polish research team having conducted in- vestigations on behalf of the Auschwitz Museum, we also know that the disinfestation chamber in the Auschwitz main camp is colored a spotty blue. 56,57 To my knowledge, only the Zyklon B disinfestation chambers of Dachau camp (DEGESCH circulation chambers) exhibit no blue pigmentation, because the walls were professionally coated with a paint impermeable to gas and water.   315 Iron Blue is the ISO designation (ISO 2495) for iron cyanide blue pigments of various compo- sition, which are also known as Berlin Blue , Turnbull’s Blue, Prussian Blue, Vossen Blue ® , Milori Blue, Paris Blue, French Blue, China Blue, Bronze Blue, Steel Blue, Ink Blue, among others."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"6.

The large- scale, long-term use of hydrogen cyanide for vermin control in disin- festation chambers only began, in practice, with the onset of the Sec- ond World War. And with the dissolution of the National Socialist prisoner camps, the confiscation of the corporation having manufac- tured and marketed Zyklon B (the I.G. Farbenindustrie AG ), and the invention of DDT at the end of World War II, this large-scale use of hydrogen cyanide ended just as abruptly. No one cared about any ‘in- stances of building damage’ having occurred in the former National Socialist disinfestation chambers in this period. The question never arose in the literature... until Frederick A. Leuchter came along. The following is an attempt to demonstrate the manner in which these blue pigments, referred to as Iron Blue, came to be formed in the masonry during fumigation with HCN, and the conditions favorable to their formation. There have been many publications on this chemical compound in the last five decades, which were perused and will be summarized in the following in relation to our topic. In so doing, attention was di- rected at: 1) the circumstances which lead to the formation of Iron Blue, and 2) the long-term stability of Iron Blue under the existing circum- stances.   318 Taken from the book by Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf, Das KL Stutthof , op. cit.

As a consequence, I over-examined several chemical aspects involved, some of which can be understood only by chemical experts.

For some readers it might be advisable to skip these chapters. They will most likely not miss anything. 319 But first a short description of the starting substance, hydrogen cyanide. 6.3. Properties of Hydrogen Cyanide, HCN Hydrogen cyanide, a colorless liquid, is similar, in many of its physical properties, to water. 320 This similarity also explains the limit- less solubility of HCN in water and its strong tendency towards absorption (dissolution) in water. The equilibrium concentration 321 of hydrogen cyanide in water is inves tigated in more detail in chapter 6.5.3. The opinion is often expressed that, because gaseous hydrogen cyanide is approximately 5% lighter than air, it must separate from air and rise. Hydrogen cyanide gas is, however, only slightly lighter than air and does not separate, because of the thermal movement of every gas particle. To clarify this, reference must be made to the principal components of air: The main component of air, nitrogen, 78% by vol- ume, is 8% heavier than hydrogen cyanide gas. If a separation took place between hydrogen cyanide gas and nitrogen, it would all the more occur between the two main components of air, since oxygen (21% of air by volume) is 15% heav ier than nitrogen. This would have   319 I also want to point out that I did not include all this academic, self-serving ivory tower chatter in order to impress people.

This obviously does not happen. Thus, a spontaneous separation of hydrogen cyanide gas would never take place in air. The 5% lesser density of pure hydrogen cyanide gas compared to air (this corresponds to a density difference of 35°C warm air as com- pared to 20°C warm air) can however very well lead to a density con- vection, when pure gaseous hydrogen cyanide is released in a location with the same temperature as the ambi ent air. The gas would then rise slowly, but gradually mix with the ambient air. But to conclude from this that hydrogen cyanide vapors always rise, would be an incorrect conclusion. At 15°C, for example, on physicochemical grounds, no concentrations higher than 65% of hydrogen cyanide can occur in air (see Graph 1); the density of such a mixture lies only approximately 3% below that of air. Furthermore, a great deal of energy is withdrawn from the ambient air by the evaporating hydrogen cyanide. Conse- quently, the ambient temperature sinks until exactly as much energy is transported to the liquid (adsorbed) HCN as needed for the decelerated evaporation at the corresponding lower temperature. It is therefore theoretically possible for hydrogen cyanide vapors containing little HCN, but which are cold, to be den ser, that is, heavier than the ambi- ent air. Graph 1 shows the equilibrium per centage of hydrogen cyanide in air as a function of temperature. Even at 0°C, the percentage still lies at   322 W. Braker, A.L.

Condensation of HCN on sur- rounding objects would occur only if the percentage rose over the equilibrium per- centage (the so- called dew point). Since in all cases here under con- sideration, a ma- ximum concentra- tion of 10% HCN in air would only be reached for a short period of time close to the source of HCN (the Zyklon B carrier), no condensa- tion of HCN on walls can be expected. An exception is, however, the so-called capillary condensation, which can occur in finely porous ma- terials such as cement mortar. 324 Hydrogen cyanide forms explosive mixtures with air in the range of 6 to 41% by volume. With strong initial ignition, its explosive ef- fects can be compared with nitro-glycerin. 325 In the applications under discussion here, a proportion of 6% by volume and more can be reached in the immediate vicinity of the source, which suffices for lo- cal blow ups at the most. Hence, only inappropriately high concentra- tions can lead to explosive mixtures, as shown by a corresponding ac- cident in 1947. 16 With correct application quantities and concentra- tions, the technical literature indicates that there is practically no dan- ger of explosion. 326   324 The lowered vapor pressure caused by adsorp tion effects in a narrow hollow space leads to early condensation. 325 The usual explosive in dynamite.

Composition of Iron Blue 6.4.1. Overview The stoichiometric composition of an ideal Iron Blue crystal is: Fe 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3 It is characteristic that the iron in this compound is present in two different oxidation states: Fe 2+ (here in square brackets) and Fe 3+ (here on the outer left). The interaction between these two different iron ions also gives rise to the blue color of this compound (Charge-Transfer- Complex). The actual composition can be quite variable, depending on the stoichiometry on formation and the presence of impurities, in which case the color varies between dark blue and greenish-blue tones. 6.4.2.

The resulting crystal is there- fore very faulty and more appropriately called a polymer. 330 By filtra- tion, drying and intensive grinding, however, this very inhomogene- ous, polluted Iron Blue can be transformed into a pigment which is only hardly colloidal dispersible. 331 This ‘soluble’ Iron Blue is not soluble in the original sense of th e word, but can more easily be col- loidally dispersed than the ‘insoluble’ Iron Blue, which is very impor- tant for its application as a pigment. 332,333 However, these colloids are very instable and precipitate easily when salts are added. 334 According to Buser, 329 even in presence of high concentrations of potassium ions, almost pure ‘insoluble’ Iron Blue can be obtained, if the formation process is proceeding slowly enough.

Overview We are only concerned, in this connection, with how Iron Blue arises from hydrogen cyanide and iron compounds in building materi- als. In building materials, the iron is generally present in trivalent form (Fe 3+ ), in the form of ‘rust’.   330 Originally, this term was used only in orga nic chemistry for chain like connected, sometimes also branched attachments of equal segments. 331 Dispersion (lat.: dispersere, distribute) are distri bution of two different phases within each other. They are called colloids (gr.: gluelike) if the particles are between 10 -8 and 10 -7 m small. Such a mixture in liquids scatters the light (Tyndall effect), is thus not clear. But due to elec- trostatic repulsion (equally charged particles), colloids do not tend to coagulate and precipi- tate.

If this mechanism is assume d, the result, purely stoichiome trically, is that an alkaline environment must be favorable. This finding is supported by the known fact that hexacyan- oferrate(III) is a strong oxidation agent in alkalin e medium and is even able to oxidize triva- lent chrome to hexavalent, therefore, that is, CN – ions must have oxidized very quickly: J.C.

The driving force in the reduction of the Fe 3+ is the considerably more favorable energetical situation of the hexacyanoferrate(II) as compared to hexacyanoferrate(III); see, in this regard, R.M.

For this reason, a direct reduction of uncomplexed Fe 3+ , i.e. , not surrounded by cyanide, has an energy disadvantage and is therefore negligible. 339 Dissociation : is the splitting of a compound, in this case into two differently charged ions (heterolytic) in aqueous medium (electrolysis): HCN + H 2 O Æ CN – + H 3 O + "},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"6.

The velocity of formation of the pigment can be influenced by various factors, which will be considered: 1. Water content of the reaction medium; 2. Reactivity of the iron; 3. Temperature; 4. Acid content. 6.5.2. Water Content 6.5.2.1.

All reactions listed in chapter 6.5.1. un- der a)-e) occur almost exclusively in water. Water furthermore ensures that the reaction partners—all salts capable of being dissolved in wa- ter—come together in the first place. Finally, the moisture contained in the building material also acts as a hydrogen cyanide trap, since hydro- gen cyanide dissolves eagerly in wate r. A relatively high water content in the masonry will therefore cons iderably increase the speed of reac- tion. 6.5.2.2. Excursus The reason for the low reactivity of HCN compared to the free cyanide ion is because HCN is l ess nulceophilic than the free ion. 341 Aside from the dissociation of hydr ogen cyanide in water, the process   340 Correct: hexacyanoferrate(III). 341 nucleophilic (gr.: core/nucleus loving) is the tendenc y of a particle to react with positively charged particles. For this, at least a partial ne gative charge of the nucleophilic particle is re- quired. In this case, cyanide is , due to its negative charge (CN – ), much more nucleophilic to- wards the positively charge iron (Fe 3+ ) than the formally uncharged (though polar) hydrogen cyanide."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 162 of chemisorption 313 on solid surfaces deserves being mentioned, where the hydrogen cyanide releases its proton (H + ) to an alkaline oxide and is itself attached to a metal ion. Absorption and dissociation of the superbly soluble hydrogen cya- nide (see chapter 6.5.4.) is clearly superior to chemisorption. Further- more, the aqueous solution (as solven t) is indispensable for the com- plex formation and redox reactions of the cyanide with Fe 3+ . Addition- ally, the aqueous medium makes the reacting agents mobile, which do not always form at the same location. And finally, the moisture con- tained in the solid material works as a trap for hydrogen cyanide, be- cause it intensely binds the hydrogen cyanide. Or the other way around: the drier a solid material is, the easier hydrogen cyanide, which was ad-/absorbed before, will be released back into the envi- ronment. Therefore, a relatively high water content of the solid mate- rial will accelerate the reaction. Experiments with reactions of hydrogen cyanide (some 4 g per m³ in air, 15°C, 75% rel. humidity) with mixtures of Fe(OH) 2 -Fe(OH) 3 attached to wet paper strips showed that a blue discoloration occurred after 30 min at a pH value 342 of 2 to 3, since at such low values almost no hydrogen cyanide dissociates to the reactive cyanide (see chapter 6.5.5.). At pH values of 7 to 9, a visible blue discoloration occurred after a few minutes of inserting the sample. At higher pH values, this time span grew again, because the initially absorbed hydrogen cyanide had to lower the pH value first, before it could form the pigment (see chapter 6.6.1., pH Sensitivity). These experiments show clearly that undissociated, gaseous HCN or HCN dissolved as gas shows no reactivity. An addition of small amounts of KCN to an aqueous sulfuric acid solution of Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ , however, results in the immediate precipitation of the pigment. The cyanide obviously reacts faster with the iron salts than it is protonated by sulfuric acid, i.e. , converted into hydrogen cyanide.   342 pH (pondus hydrogenii) is a measure for the acid content of aqueous solutions (negative, decadic logarithm of H 3 O + concentration: -lg 10 (c(H 3 O + ))): pH < 7: acid pH = 7: neutral pH > 7: alkaline"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"6. F ORMATION AND S TABILITY OF I RON B LUE 163 6.5.3. Reactivity of Trivalent Iron 6.5.3.1. Overview The solubility of trivalent iron diminishes rapidly with increasing alkalinity (rising pH value). Even in a pH neutral environment, almost all iron is bound as rust. 343 The reaction between iron compounds and cyanide resulting in the formation of the intermediate product iron(III)- cyanide, [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3– , is therefore largely a reaction on the solid-liquid interface, that is, between the iron adhering to the solid body and the cyanide ion in solution. This reaction occurs considerably more slowly than the same reaction in an aqueous solution. The fastest possible re- action requires a large surface area on the solid-fluid phase boundary, that is, a large, interior, microscopically rough surface and a fine, highly porous solid body, since in such cases, a lot of the iron com- pounds lie on the surface and are therefore less solidly bound and can quickly combine with cyanide. In an increasingly alkaline environment, only decreasingly small amounts of ‘rust’ can slowly be converted into iron(II)-cyanide, but cannot react with iron(III)-ions to form Iron Blue. 6.5.3.2. Excursus Even in an alkaline environment, it must be expected that rust, in the presence of perceptible cyanide c oncentrations, will be quite slowly transformed into iron(III)-cyanide and finally into iron(II)-cyanide. 344 The last step required for the formation of Iron Blue, however, the combination of iron(II)-cyanide with iron(III), will not occur due to the lack of dissolved iron(III)-ions. In a strongly alkaline environment, an increasing concentration of iron(II)-cyanide, which is chemically sta- ble, can slowly accumulate. It remains in a stand-by position, waiting for the pH value to drop. Iron salts generally tend to incor porate water, and Iron Blue is no exception to this. A higher water content in the solid body results in   343 Fe 2 O (3-x) ( OH) 2x · x H 2 O 344 Naturally, the equilibrium of the reaction Fe(OH) 3 + 6 CN – ⇀ ↽ [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3- + 3 OH – under such conditions is strongly on the left hand si de. However, this does not mean, as is well known, that a minute quantity of iron(III)-cyanide will not be formed. The latter, however, is withdrawn from the equilibrium in alkaline medi um in the presence of excess cyanide, by be- ing reduced by the latter to iron(II)-cyanide, which is considerably more stable in alkaline me- dium than iron(III)-cyanide; for further details, see also chapter 6.6.1."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 164 increased water accumulation in rust, too. The rust expands, so to speak, and thus becomes more reactive towards competing ligands 345 like cyanide. Freshly precipitated, extremely moist and non-homo- genous iron hydroxide precipitations possess extreme reactivity, and together with hydrogen cyanide, as shown in chapter 6.5.2.2., they form the pigment in visible quantities in minutes. For the formation of colloidally dispersible Iron Blue, the quick formation in aqueous solution with hi gh concentrations of the agents is required (see chapter 6.4.2.), since this leads to heterogeneous crystal- lites (tiny crystals) with many inclusions (ions, solvent molecules) and a high degree of disorder. These crystallites have only a small tendency to coagulate. The slow interface reaction on the phase-boundary layer liquid- solid with quite low concentrations of the reacting agents will suppress the formation of colloidally dispersible Iron Blue. The process de- scribed here, occurring in walls exposed to hydrogen cyanide, strongly resembles the formation of monocrystals as described by Buser, 329 since in this case also, one reagent (Fe 2+ ) had to be formed through slow reduction by excess cyanide. Thus, except from the inhomogene- ous material, the conditions here unde r consideration are suitable for a slow crystal growth of insoluble Iron Blue without large amounts of inclusions and formation of crystal defects. 6.5.4.

These high concen- trations prove the ex- treme solubility of hy- drogen cyanide in wa- ter. 320 It decreases by approximately half every 20°C. It is therefore approximately 10,000 times more soluble in water than oxygen (O 2 ) and approximately 250 times more soluble than carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). The latter is not without importance, since the opinion is sometimes expressed in the literature that the carbon dioxide content of air could have an influence on the amount of hydrogen cyanide soluble in wa- ter. 57 But since hydrogen cyanide is considerably more soluble in water than CO 2 , and since CO 2 , furthermore, is hardly converted into car- bonic acid in water at all, this influence may be disregarded. 349 B: The moisture content of masonr y is very strongly dependent on the relative humidity of air and the temperature.

CO 2 + H 2 O ⇌ H 2 CO 3 ; 2. CN – + H 2 CO 3 ⇀ ↽ HCN + HCO 3 – . Since, however, CO 2 is only soluble in water with difficulty and since, in addition, the equilibrium of the reaction CO 2 + H 2 O ⇀ ↽ H 2 CO 3 (carbonic acid) lies almost completely on the left side, the concentration of carbonic acid in the moisture of masonry it- self is several orders of magnit ude lower than that of the hydroge n cyanide, even if the content of carbon dioxide in the room under consideration, exposed to hydrogen cyanide, is similar to the hydrogen cyanide content.

Drops in water content by a power of ten at temperature increases of 10°C have been proven in the tem- perature ranges of 10-30°C under c onsideration (see chapter 6.7.). C: Only an acceleration in the slowest of the five steps described in chapter 6.5.1. can be responsible for a change in the velocity of the entire reaction. In neutral or alkaline medium, this is the displacement of the oxygen or OH – -ion in rust by the cyanide ion (point c). Although the iron(III)-cyanide [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3– itself is stable in a moderately alka- line medium 350 —that is, the iron(III)-cyanide is more stable than the rust—the displacement of the OH – -ions in rust is inhibited by the cya- nide, since the rust is not dissolved in water. An increase in tempera- ture by 20°C usually doubles the velocity of reaction, if the other pa- rameters remain unchanged. This is, however, not so in extreme cases, since, as shown above, the velocity of reaction is very strongly negatively influenced by the massively decreased water content at higher temperatures (see above): decreased mobility of the reaction partner, decreased reactivity of iron, increased evaporation of ad-/abso rbed hydrogen cyanide etc. (see chapters 6.5.2. and 6.5.3.). A strong reduction in pigment formation must therefore be expected at increased temperatures. A decisively higher water content of the solid material and the considerably better absorption and solubility properties of hydrogen cyanide in water are the reasons for the tendency of solid materials to accumulate more cyanides with lowe r temperatures. An increase in the reactivity of iron oxide (rust) in the solid body with relation to hydro- gen cyanide with a higher water content of the solid material at lower temperatures must be anticipated, as well as with a general increase in the reactivity of all agents. A cooler, and thus moister, solid material is therefore better suited to the formation of Iron Blue than a warm, dry body. 351   350 See also J.C.

B: According to the literature, the dissociation behavior of acids as a function of temperature is not unanimous. 353 Although there is a ten- dency of increasing protolysis 354 with rising temperature, this tendency turns upside down at higher temperatures for some acids, others show generally falling values. Since the cha nges are generally in the range of low percentages only, and because speed of protolysis is generally very high, hence never a restricting factor, this can be neglected here. 6.5.5. pH Value The pH value (acidity) influences the formation in various ways. In chapter 6.5.1., reference has alr eady been made to the higher reduc- tion power of cyanide and iron(III)-cyanide in alkaline environment. The pH value also influences the reactivity of iron compounds in the solid body (chapter 6.5.3.). As remarked above, dissolved hydrogen cyanide hardly exhibits reactivity. The formation of cyanide ions by absorption and dissocia- tion of hydrogen cyanide only starts in sufficient degree at neutral pH values and above, see Graph 4. 355 The data leading to Graph 4, together with the data that enabled us to pl ot Graph 2 (saturation concentration of HCN as a function of temperature), leads to a graph revealing the relationship between temperature, pH value (acid content), and CN – saturation concentra- tion, see Graph 5 (at a concentration of 1 mol% HCN in air, which is approximately 1% by weight, the usual disinfestation   353 R.C.

The actual cyanide concentration in masonry is determined by the velocity of absorption of the gas, adsorption effects within the solid material, and possible reactions of the cyanide. The result of all these factors is that slightly alkaline pH values are favorable to the formation of the pigment. The individual parameters and their influence on the formation of Iron Blue are summarized in the following table: Table 4: Formation of Iron Blue Parameter Effect Water con- tent Increase in water content results in the following: increased absorp- tion of hydrogen cyanide; long-term retention of ad-/absorbed hydro- gen cyanide; increased mobility of reaction partners; increased reac- tivity of iron oxide; water is the basic precondition for disassociation and redox reactions; generally positive influence with increasing water content.

Stability of Iron Blue 6.6.1. pH Sensitivity Iron Blue is an extremely acid-resistant, but base-decomposing pigment. 357 Hydrogen cyanide is only released by warm, diluted sulfu- ric acid, while hydrochloric acid, by contrast, has no effect. 358 In a clearly alkaline environment, i.e. , in the presence of high concentra- tions of OH – ions, these displace the cyanide ion from the iron(III)-ion. Fe(OH) 3 is then precipitated (‘rust sl udge’), and the Iron Blue is de- stroyed. 359   357 The hexacyanoferrate acids are very strong acids: J. Jordan, G.J. Ewing, Inorg. Chem. 1 (1962), pp. 587-591. The findings of analyses of disassociation constants show, for hexacyan- oferrate(III): K III 1 >K III 2 >K III 3 >0.1; hexacyanoferrate(II): K II 1 >K II 2 >0.1; K II 3 =6×10 -3 ; K II 4 =6.7 × 10 -5 .

Based on comparative calculations between the known solubility of Fe(OH) 3 on the one hand, and the limit value of the pH stability of Iron Blue on the other hand (pH 10), the approximate solubility of Iron Blue in water can, however, be cal- culated (see chapter 6.6.2.2.). It amounts to approximately 10 -24 g Iron Blue per liter of water, this means that 0.000000000000000000000001 g Iron Blue dissolve in 1,000 g of water. In addition to a compound’s solubility in water, its condition (crudely or finely crystalline, supe rficially adherent or adsorbed by capillary effects) as well as, in particular, the condition and quantity of   the Fe 3+ is, initially, merely withdrawn; the base-resistant [Fe(CN) 6 ] 4- remains intact; see note 344. 360 See the studies by M.A. Alich et al. , op. cit. (note 338). 361 J.A. Sistino, op. cit. (note 332); H. Beakes, Paint Ind. Mag. 69(11) (1954), pp. 33f. Mixtures of Iron Blue and phtalocyanine blue generally find application, since both, alone, lack suffi- cient long-term stability; Degussa describes the lime fastness of Iron Blue as “ not good ” (H. Ferch, H. Schäfer, op. cit. (note 333)); however, Degussa is referring to its fastness on still un- carbonated, alkaline plasters and concretes: H. Winkler, Degussa AG, letter to this author, June 18, 1991. My own experiments with the di ssolution of fresh Iron Blue precipitations re- sulted in a limit value of pH 10-11 for the stability of Iron Blue. 362 This property is used in Russian industry, for example, for the passivation of steel pipes against aggressive waste waters, since CN – contained in waste waters coats the interior of pipes with an insoluble protective layer of Iron Blue: N.G. Chen, J. Appl. Chem. USSR , 74(1)(1974), pp. 139-142. But it should be noted that this borders on criminal negligence, since toxic cyanides simply do not belong in waste waters. 363 DIN Safety Data Sheet VOSSEN-Blau ® , in: Schriftenreihe Pigmente Nr. 50 , Degussa AG, Frankfurt 1985; see also H.

Iron Blue formed in masonry will be pre- sent in a finely crystalline form and adsorbed by capillary effects, in which case the former favors dissoluti on, while the latter is extremely detrimental to dissolution. Water almost or entirely saturated with iron(III)-ions is no longer capable of dissolving further iron. Further- more, water permeation through finely porous solid material like ma- sonry is extremely low even at high water tables; the iron saturation concentration is quickly attained, which, in addition, as remarked above, is generated by the slightly more soluble iron oxides of the solid body rather than by the Iron Blue having once arisen. It is furthermore very well known that mortar and conc rete permeated with paints prac- tically cannot be rendered colorless. 364 It cannot, therefore, be antici- pated that the Iron Blue content once having arisen in walls can be per- ceptibly reduced by dissolution in water. Water running down the exte- rior surfaces is considerably more aggressive, exerting, in particular, an erosive effect, i.e. , damaging the masonry as such. 6.6.2.2. Excursus Tananaev et al. 365 examined the solubility of metal hexacyanofer- rate(II) and discovered a solubility product 366 of 3 · 10 -41 (pK S =40.5) for the solubility product of Iron Blue, without mentioning the unit used. Assuming they used the summation formula of Fe 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3 (unit being mol 7 l -7 ), one attains a solubility of 0.5 mg per liter water. Thus, it would be 14 times less soluble than the nearly insoluble cal- cium carbonate (CaCO 3 , 7.1 mg per liter water, K S = 4.95 · 10 -10 mol 2 l - 2 ). 367 Later publications support these findings, 336 although attention must be paid to deviations in th e stoichiometry (composition) of Iron Blue with impurities, leading to an increased solubility. Tananaev et al. precipitated the complex metal cyanoferrate from   364 See also, in this regard, the remarks of a company dealing in colored cements and concretes: Davis Colors, 3700 East Olympics Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90023, www.coloredconcrete.com/davis/Tech/03470.html. 365 I.V.

Thus, in spite of the four hour-long accumulation of the precipitation, the filtrate would certainly still have contained colloidally dispersed Iron Blue. Since they finally determined the amount of free Fe 3+ in the filtrate by pre- cipitating it with ammonia as Fe(OH) 3 , they will undoubtedly also have precipitated the Fe 3+ of the colloidally dispersed Iron Blue, as ammonia raises the pH value so much that Iron Blue is no longer stable (see chapter 6.6.1.). Therefore, they did not determine the solubility of Iron Blue, but the measure of stability of the dispersion of fresh precipitations of the pigment. The solubility product of Pb 2 [Fe(CN) 6 ] given by Krleza et al. , 336 which they used as a reference to determine the solubility products, is much lower than the one used by Tananaev et al. . If applied to Tanan- aev’s calculations, this produces a solubility of Iron Blue of only 0.05 mg per liter. Krleza et al. , however, find similar results for the solubil- ity of most of the metal cyanides analyzed, including Iron Blue. Since conventional methods of analysis, such as gravimetry and titration, tend to be unreliable when facing minute traces, one must but wonder about these similar results. However, one can escape this dilemma by thoughtful reasoning. It is safe to say that Iron Blue is stable at a pH value of 7, i.e. , in a neutral aqueous medium, so we take this as a minimum value. As men- tioned earlier, a pH value of about 10 can be considered the upper limit of stability for Iron Blue, so we take this as maximum value for the following calculations. At pH=7, and even more so at pH=10, the free iron concentration is extremely low, since Fe(OH) 3 is nearly insoluble (see Table 5). At pH 7 and 10, respectively, a saturated Fe(OH) 3 solution has the following free Fe 3+ concentration: c(Fe 3+ ) = K L (Fe(OH) 3 ) c 3 (OH - )   (2)   pH=7: = 2.67×10 -39 mol 4 l -4 10 -21 mol 3 l -3 = 2.67×10 -18 mol l -1 (3) pH=10: = 2.67×10 -39 mol 4 l -4 10 -12 mol 3 l -3 = 2.67×10 -27 mol l -1 (4)"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 174 Should the free Fe 3+ concentration surpass this value due to a bet- ter solubility of Iron Blue, then Fe 3+ would precipitate as hydroxide and would be increasingly removed from the pigment, thereby destroy- ing it in the end. Since this does not happen at pH=7 at all, and pH=10 can be considered the point where it just starts to happen, the concen- tration of the Fe 3+ ion in a saturated Iron Blue solution must lie well below 10 -18 mol/liter, i.e. , in the area of 10 -27 mol/liter. Thus, the solu- bility of Iron Blue must also have a value around 10 -27 mol per liter (actually: ¼ of the free Fe 3+ concentration, K S less than 4.1 · 10 -187 mol 7 l -7 , pK S larger than 186.6) which, at a mol mass of 1,110 g mol -1 ((Fe 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3 · 14 H 2 O) would correlate to 10 -24 g. With this, the complex iron pigment does indeed deserve to be called insoluble, as only one part of dissolved Iron Blue can statisti- cally be found in 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 parts of water (10 29 ). The actual solubility would therefore be less by a factor of 10 20 as determined by Tananaev et al. , which would come pretty close to values calculated for other so-called ‘insoluble’ compounds, like mercury sulfide (HgS). However, one must consider that the chemistry of Fe 3+ in aqueous solutions doesn’t justify the terms ‘dis- solved’ or ‘precipitated’, since a mu ltitude of complexes do exist in the 1E-30 1E-27 1E-24 1E-21 1E-18 1E-15 1E-12 1E-09 1E-06 1E-03 234567891011 pH value c(Fe³+) [mol/l] 0 50 100 150 200 250 pKs(Iron Blue) Graph 6: Free Fe³ + concentration as a function of pH value and the resulting minimal pK S value of Iron Blue, depending on its stability at the corresponding pH value. pK S value acc. to Tananaev et al. : 40.5; according to reflections made her e: greater than 123, smaller than 186.

Graph 6 shows the correlation between the pH value of the free Fe 3+ -concentration in a hypothetical sat urated solution of Iron Blue and the respectively resulting minimal pK S values possible for Iron Blue, which it must possess, should stability prevail at the given pH-reading. Tananaev’s pK S value given, it is obvious that the pigment would re- main stable only up to pH 3. Accordingly, it would dissociate itself by its eigen pH value of 4 (see chapter 6.6.1., note 358), which is formed in its own dispersion. Thus the magnitude of error in the results of Tananaev et al. and Krleza et al. is apparent. These reflections show that iron, bound as hydroxides or oxides in solid materials, tends to dissolve in a neutral medium more readily than Iron Blue, since its equilibrium concentration must be higher than that of Iron Blue. 6.6.3. Excursus: Competing Ligands As shown, OH – -ions may, due to the low solubility of Fe(OH) 3 , noticeably precipitate the Fe 3+ of Iron Blue in pH media above 9 to 10.

The un- bound cyanide will be oxidized and destroyed by hydroxyl radicals originating from the parallelly occurring photolysis of water. 378 How- ever, results are not unequivocal. 379 As for Iron Blue, one knows of the bleaching effect under strong, perpetual sun radiation and the ensuing re-darkening during the night. 380 Here also, the liberation of CN – is responsible, which reduces parts of the Fe 3+ ions to Fe 2+ ions. The latter process, however, will reverse during the night under the in fluence of oxygen and moisture. The Iron Blue concentration will eventually be reduced by the loss of the released CN – , either by evaporation of hydrogen cyanide, by wash- ing out as CN – , or by oxidation through Fe 3+ /atmospheric oxygen or from hydroxyl radicals from the natural photolysis of water. The latter process is minute and can therefore be omitted. At any rate, most of the cyanide released by photolysis will again be complex bound to iron. 6.6.5.

The test sheets were then exposed to the environment on the roof of a building in a vertical 45° angle facing south-west. During the 21 years lasting test, in which eight Iron Blue samples were tested among other pigments, the Iron Blue, in particular, fol- lowed by iron ochre (Fe 2 O 3 , rust), exhibited only minimal alterations after this period of time. One sample of Iron Blue and iron ochre was removed only after 10 to 11 years in each case. 383 All other samples still exhibited an intense blue color. Half of the seven remaining Iron Blue samples received the value 4 out of a maximum of 5 points for the best retention of quality, on the grey scale used there in the deter- mination of color changes. Only minor alterations were detected.

What is remark- able is that in determining the degree of destruction of the pigment no unexposed samples were used since these had been lost over the 21- year period; rather, places on the surface of the exhibits which had been relatively well protected from direct environmental influences by the frames and by rubber rings on the screw joints were used as control samples.

F ORMATION AND S TABILITY OF I RON B LUE 179 est here, this long-term test involved considerably more severe condi- tions, since in this case, the extern ally formed Iron Blue was only su- perficially adsorbed upon the aluminium sheets. The pigment neverthe- less resisted extremely well. Another event proves the extraordinary long-term stability of Iron Blue. For many decades at the end of the 19 th and the early decades of the 20 th century, Iron Blue was a by-product in the generation of city gas, because the hydrogen cyanide contained in coke gas had to be eliminated for security reasons by washing it with iron hydroxide prior to introduction into the city gas ne twork. Iron Blue is the end product of this washing process. City gas works frequently disposed of this product by distributing some of it over their factory terrain with the intend to kill weeds—in vain, though, since Iron Blue has no effect as an herbicide. Today, the grounds of former German city gas works still contain high quantities of Iron Blue, many decades after the works were put out of operation. It was neither decomposed, nor dissolved or washed away by rain water, since it is insoluble. In particular, terrain with a high Iron Blue content is not considered polluted, since it is physiologically unobjectionable due to its stability. 385 In summary, it may be stated that Iron Blue having formed in the interior of a wall as a component of the wall itself, possesses a longevity comparable to the iron oxide from wh ich it has formed. This means sim- ply that Iron Blue possesses a degree of stability which is comparable to that of the masonry itself: the Iron Blue will remain contained in the wall for as long as the wall itself remains in existence. 386 Once perceptible quantities of cyan ide have accumulated within a wall, therefore, and once conditions permit the conversion of the cyanide into Iron Blue, no perceptible reducti on in the Iron Blue content can be anticipated, even after fifty years or more. A typical example of the manner in which the media deal with these facts is a press report issued by the German Press Agency ( Deutsche Presseagentur , dpa) on March 29, 1994, and which was then published in many German newspapers and ev en broadcast on radio.

Influence of Various Building Materials 6.7.1. Brick 6.7.1.1. Overview Bricks are well-known to acquire their hardness and stability dur- ing their baking process. This causes an intensive binding of the com- ponents in bricks (sintering). One result of this is that the reactivity of the iron oxide occurring in bricks (2 to 4%) is strongly reduced, so that a perceptible inclination to form ir on cyanide is hardly to be antici- pated. The immediate surface of bricks slightly attacked by atmos- pheric influences (weathering) nevertheless constitutes an exception to this rule, so that the superficially adherent iron oxide is available for conversion into Iron Blue.   387 German daily newspapers, for instance: Süddeutsche Zeitung , Stuttgarter Zeitung , Südwest- presse-Verbund (March 29, 1994), taz , Frankfurter Rundschau (March 30, 1994). 388 See also W.

How- ever, partly dissolved iron at brick surfaces immediately exposed to weathering can be set free for reactions in bigger amounts.

It later falls, howev er, due to the binding of carbon diox- ide from the air. Depending on the special chemistry of the cement mortar, this process proceeds very slowly in the depth of the material. According to the composition of the cement mortar, this may last from a few months to many decades, until the pH value of such a mortar or concrete becomes neutral, ev en in the deepest layers. 396-398 This chemi- cal behavior explains the entire secret of the stability of reinforced concrete, which prevents the embedde d steel from rusting further in the environment within the concrete, which remains alkaline for lengthy periods of time. 399 The water content of concrete and cement mortars depends on the temperature and relative humidity of the air and fluctuates between 1% and less at 20°C and 60% relative humidity up to 10% in air saturated with humidity. 395 In case of permanently high humidity, penetrating wetness from outside, a huge part of the pore system can be filled with water. 400 Poorly insulated rooms built unde rground always have cool and humid walls due to their great exchange surface area with the ground: partly because of their absorption of humidity from the ground, and partly because of the condensation of humidity in the air on the cool walls when the temperature falls below the dew point. The water content of these walls therefore lies around 10%, i.e. , a factor of approximately 10 or more above that of dry walls of heated rooms built above ground. 6.7.2.2.

If the main pore volume is formed by micropores, then the gas diffusion into the material is more inhib- ited than if the main pore volume is formed by larger pores. Graph 7 shows the accumulated pore volume di stribution of concrete and one wall mortar (exact composition unknown, since taken from an old wall, but according to its brittle consistency probably a lime mortar). Having a similar total pore volume like the wall mortar (here only 14% due to the test method), the c oncrete’s largest portion of pore vol- ume lies between a pore radius of 0.01 and 0.1 μm, whereas the wall mortar’s largest portion lies between 0.1 und 10 μm. Hence, if com- pared with the wall mortar, the gas diffusion into the concrete will be disadvantaged. In general, the average pore size of cement building materials changes to larger values when increasing the content of sand and lime. Fresh concrete is relatively strongly alkaline, caused by the high content of calcium hydroxide, which, however, gets bound as calcium alumosilicates rather quickly. However, depending on the type of ce- ment, a certain amount of it is released as time goes by. The pH value of non-carbonated concrete is around 12.5. It later falls, however, due to the binding of carbon dioxide from the air. The speed of carbonation into the depth of the concrete depends strongly on the consistency and porosity of the material and follows a square root relation: 403 D = c · t (5) d = depth of carbonation c = constant t = time In water tight concretes, it takes many years for the limit of car- bonation to advance only a few centimeters due to the inhibition of diffusion in this highly compact material. In the area of carbonation, the pH value decreases to roughly 7, the equilibrium value of saturated calcium carbonate solutions. But if the wall is wet, this results in a proton exchange and therefore no sharp pH border is formed. If a large portion of the air pores (size in the or- der of a tenth of a millimeter) flooded with water poor in carbon diox- ide, the carbonation advances more slowly, because compared to the   403 W.

F ORMATION AND S TABILITY OF I RON B LUE 185 gaseous phase, diffusion in aqueous phases is much slower, by some orders of magnitude. In case of waters rich in carbon dioxide, however, this can accelerate the carbonation. 6.7.3. Lime Mortar The iron content of lime mortars is based, in particular, on the ad- mixed sand (up to 4 % Fe 2 O 3 ). Lime mortar is manufactured using only burnt lime (CaO), sand, and water and acquires its solidity through the binding of slaked lime (Ca(OH) 2 ) with atmospheric carbon dioxide to lime (CaCO 3 ). This procedure takes only days or weeks (depending on the thickness of the particular layers), due to the cruder porous system which facilitates the diffusion of gas. For fresh lime mortar, an extreme high water content can be damaging, as the carbon dioxide necessary for the binding process can no longer penetrate into the wall. The final ph value of this material lies within the neutral range. Since this medium no longer provides sufficient protection for steel reinforcement rods and offers only slight environmental resistance, it is usually used for the plastering of interior walls and for interior brick walls only, in the latter case often mixed with cement. 400 The specific surface of lime mortar lies considerably beneath that of cement mortar (up to one order of magnitude). 404 The water content is similar to ce- ment mortar. 6.7.4. Effects upon the Formation of Iron Blue The first step in the formation of Iron Blue in masonry is the ab- sorption of gaseous hydrogen cyanide. A cool (10°C ) wall in a cellar with atmospheric humidity near the saturation point, due to its higher water content (by a factor of at l east 10), has an increased ability (by a factor of 10) to absorb hydrogen cy anide compared to warm walls in a heated room built above ground with lower atmospheric humidity (20°C, 50% rel.). The second step in the formation of Iron Blue is the ionic split (disassociation) of the hydrogen cyanide, that is, its conversion into simple cyanide. 405 This procedure requires an alkaline environment,   404 The reason: no formation of very finely cr ystalline alumosilicate with higher surface area. 405 In masonry, this largely corresponds to the neutralization of the hydrogen cyanide by calcium hydroxide Ca(OH) 2 into calcium cyanide Ca(CN) 2 ."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 186 which, in lime mortars, lasts only for a few days or weeks, but which are present for months or years in cement mortar and concrete. The next step is the formation of iron(III)-cyanide, a process that hardly occurs in a strongly alkaline environment and which occurs slowly in slightly alkaline environm ents. In the neutral range, this reac- tion is once again slowed down because the cyanide converts into non- reactive, volatile hydrogen cyanide by the humidity in the wall. The environment around the carbonation lim it of concrete and mortar (which is slightly alkaline), can therefore be addressed as the area in which iron(III)-cyanide can form easily. In a strongly alkaline area of the masonry, it only arrives at this prior stage of Iron Blue formation through the slow detour of the reduction of slight traces of iron(III)- cyanide to iron(II)-cyanide. A large surface area, as found in cement mortars and concrete, is especially favorable to the solid-liquid inter- face reaction between solid rust and cyanide in a liquid solution. These generally have the advantage of retaining an alkaline medium for longer periods of time, so that the cyanide accumulated in the masonry is not lost and has enough time to react with rust. Once again, a high water content, which broadens the range of moderately alkaline acid values, is advantageous. 406 The reduction of a part of the iron(III)-ions to iron(II)-ions finally, the next to last step in Iron Blue formation, re- quires a moderately alkaline acid value, but also occurs in the strongly alkaline range. A distinction can be made between three areas of dif- ferent reactivity in masonry: 1. Larger quantities of cyanide ions can accumulate in the non- carbonated portion, due to the alkaline medium, further favored by the increased absorption of hydrogen cyanide by the still-humid material. The cyanide is only bound as iron(III)-cyanide to a slight extent. This is converted quite rapidly into the more stable iron(II)-cyanide due to its strong oxi dation behavior in the alkaline medium. An accumulation of iron(III)-cyanide will therefore take place over a longer time period. 2. In the zone of carbonation, the tendency to accumulate cyanide is reduced, since the disassociation equilibrium lies increasingly on the side of the hydrogen cyanide. The oxidation strength of the iron(III)-cyanide is also diminished. On the other hand, the pig-   406 Very humid mortars and concretes, due to proton diffusion, exhibit no sharp carbonation, i.e. , pH limit."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"6. F ORMATION AND S TABILITY OF I RON B LUE 187 ment itself now becomes stable, so that increased quantities of iron(II)-cyanide will be converted into Iron Blue, intimately mixed with the lime which is now also forming in this area, with the now somewhat more easily soluble iron(III)-ion at the carbonation limit. 407 3. In the pH-neutral, carbonated part of the masonry, the formation is considerably dependent on the available cyanide concentration, which is strongly reduced there. Already formed iron(II)-cyanide is gradually converted into Iron Blue in the presence of humidity. Table 7 shows the adsorption values of hydrogen cyanide in vari- ous building materials. 409 They confirm the assumption of considerably higher reactivity of cements compared to brick, as well as the greater tendency of fresh cement compared to older and generally more humid building materials toward accumulation of hydrogen cyanide. The hy- drogen cyanide accumulation in concrete masonry, the age of which is unfortunately not indicated, is astonishingly high. Since by definition there is no consid- erable difference between the com- position of cement mortar and con- crete, it is fur- thermore not clear how the differing analytical results are to be inter- preted.

W.A. Uglow showed in a detailed series of tests that concrete absorbs approximately four to six times as much hydrogen cyanide as lime mortar. He also found a strong tendency of humid building materials towards increased adsorption of hydrogen cyanide. He also noted a dark blue pigmentation running through the entire concrete sample and did not therefore exclude the possibility of a chemical reaction of the hydrogen cyanide with the material. 411 The durability of very high concentrations of hydrogen cyanide over longer periods of time even in dry, chemically bound cement may be seen from Graph 8. Concentrations do not fall below ¼ of the initial values even after three days. With daily fumigation lasting several hours, this resulted, in this exampl e, in average HCN concentration in the wall swinging around approximately 100 to 200 mg hydrogen cya- nide per m 2 of masonry.

(6) c(t) = HCN concentration at time t t = time in days The first term in the above can be interpreted as desorption from the surface material with a τ 412 of 0.3 days. The second term describes a slower desorption of hydrogen cyanide with a τ of four days, perhaps caused by the much slower diffusion through the pore water of the samples. Larger errors relating to the drop in concentration described here will be made over longer periods of time because the release of hydrogen cyanide is increasingly inhibited by physical and chemical effects (forming of stable compounds).

Zyklon B for the Killing of Human Beings 7.1. Toxicological Effect of HCN The effect of hydrogen cyanide is based on the fact that it para- lyzes the respiration of every individual cell in the body. Oxygen can no longer be transported from the blood through the cell walls into the cells. 413 As the vital cell functions are thereby starved of oxygen, the animal or human being suffocates. Insects and, in particular, insect eggs, are considerably less sensi- tive to hydrogen cyanide than warm-blooded animals. On the one hand, this is due to their greater resistance (slower metabolism). On the other hand, this is due to the fact that lethal concentrations of the gas must penetrate every crack and fissure, no matter how tiny. Every hem and seam of all the garment in the property to be fumigated must be filled with the poison in order to kill, for example, every concealed louse. Warm-blooded animals, by contrast, are rapidly exposed to high concentrations of the gas, not only because of their size, but above all due to their breathing through lungs. Lethal doses of cyanide can be ingested orally, inhaled, or ab- sorbed through the skin. Oral poisoning (for example, with potassium cyanide KCN) is very painful due to muscular convulsions caused by cell suffocation. Even though victims of poisoning by inhalation of high concentrations of hydrogen cyanide become more rapidly uncon- scious than with oral ingestion, painful convulsions caused by muscu- lar suffocation appear in these cases as well. For this reason, execution by use of hydrogen cyanide gas, as pe rformed in some U.S. states, has recently been a topic of much controversy; see chapter 1. A dose of 1 mg cyanide per kg body weight is generally considered lethal. Non- lethal doses of cyanide are quickly decomposed and excreted by the body. 414   413 Reversible attachment of the cyanide onto the Fe 3+ of the cell-specific enzyme of respiration, cytochromoxidase, thereby interrupting the s upply of oxygen to the cells, rendering impossi- ble the processes of respiration which are essential for th e life of the cell. 414 Binding onto sulfur (to form rhodanide)."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 192 The bright red coloration of the blood and bruised spots, caused by over-saturation of the blood with oxygen, since the blood can no longer give off its oxygen to the cells, ar e generally considered, among other things, symptomatic of hydrogen cyanide poisoning in fatal cases. 17,415- 417 Testimonies describing a blue or green coloration of the victims are therefore false. 418 Absorption through the skin is especi ally likely when the skin has become moist, for example, as a result of sweating at work.

To kill an average person with a body weight of 100 kg, the victim must therefore ingest approximately 100 mg hydrogen cyanide (1 mg per kilo body weight). The respiration of a human being at rest amounts to approximately 15 liters of air per minute. 422 With a hydrogen cyanide content of 0.02% (approximately 0.24 mg per liter) the victim must inhale approximately 416 liters of air before ingesting the fatal quantity of hydrogen cyanide. At 15 liters per minute, this will take about half an hour. A very strong person can survive even this period of time. By contrast, a sensitive person weighing 50 kg breathing at an accelerated rate as a result of physical effort or excitement will inhale 40 liters per minute, ingesting a fatal dose of 208 liters of air in five minutes. It is obvious from these calculations, that the data in safety instructions are always intended to protect smaller, weaker people from accidents un- der the most unfavorable circumstances. The data given in the litera- ture as “ immediately ” or “ rapidly fatal ” doses are furthermore so in- definite as to be unable to satisfy our purposes. In addition, they only refer to the time when a victim has ingested a fatal dose, but not when death occurs, which can sometimes take a very long time. 423 The threshold values will be different if we require even the strongest individual, out of all conceivable individual victims, to die in just a few minutes. 424 The concentrations necessary for this purpose will, by its very nature of the thing, be several times higher than the values indicated above. They could only be determined by a series of experiments, which is naturally impossible with human beings. The only data available to us are those gathered during executions with hy- drogen cyanide carried out in the United States.

In these cases, death occurs after 4 to 10 minutes, depending on the physical constitution of the vic- tim. 425 Press reports from the USA indicate that executions lasting from 10 to 17 minutes are the rule ra ther than the exception (see chap- ter 1.1.).

However, since a considerable part of it remains dissolv ed in the half concentrated sulfu- ric acid (approximately 50%, see chapter 8.3.3.4.), we assume in the following that approximately 90 g or 75 liters hydrogen cyanide are released as gas. In North Carolina, this gas arises immediately beneath the victim, so that the victim must be exposed, immediately after the beginning of the execution process, to a concentration which probably exceeds 10% by volume for a short period, but then falls steadily as a result of diffusion of the hydrogen cyanide throughout the chamber. 426 At a normal respiration volume of approximately 15 to 20 liter per minute and assuming an average concentration during the execution of only 0.75% by volume, approximately 1.35 to 1.8 grams of HCN will be ingested in 10 minutes (150-200 liters of inhaled air), which corre- sponds to ten to twenty times the fatal dose.

Since this period of time can be decisive for the evaluation both of eyewitness accounts as well as of chemical analyses, it will be investig ated more thoroughly in this chap- ter. R.

The evapora- tion characteristics of this product at various tempera- tures, low relative humidity of the air, and a fine distribu- tion of the carrier material are repro- duced in Graph 9 as given by Irmscher. The evaporation is “ seriously delayed ” at high atmospheric humidity, because the evaporating hy- drogen cyanide withdraws considerable quantities of energy from the liquid HCN, the carrier material, and the ambient air. As a conse- quence, the temperature of the product and the ambient air drops. If the temperature of the air reaches the dew point, atmospheric humidity condenses out of the air onto the carrier material, which binds the hy- drogen cyanide and slows down the evaporation process. For later references, we want to keep in mind that, at 15°C and in the presence of lower atmospheric humidity, approximately 10% of the hydrogen cyanide used at Auschwitz have left the carrier material dur- ing the first five minutes, and approxi mately 50% after half an hour. In cool cellar areas with a relative humidity of approximately 100%, the evaporation times would have been “ seriously delayed ”. The question of how Zyklon B woul d have behaved if spread on the floor in a room filled with human beings, is somewhat more diffi- cult. The radiant heat of the bodies would have a slightly accelerating effect upon the evaporation by increasing the temperature in the vicin- ity of the floor.

The relative atmospheric humidity in the cellars of crematoria II and III, which must certainly have approached 100%, would have “ se- riously delayed ” evaporation, 428 as well as the possible fluid secretions caused by panic on the part of victims lying on the floor, which could very well have occurred as soon as the door was closed, that is, prior to release of the Zyklon B. Under such conditions, a serious delay in the discharge of the hydrogen cyanide from the carrier material would have to be anticipated. If assuming that Zyklon B introduction devices were installed in some of the Auschwitz ‘gas chambe rs’ as attested to by Michal Kula, 429 such a device would have had the following effects: a) the Zyklon B granules would not have been spread out, but rather would have been kept together by the inner wire mesh, reducing the evapora- tion rate considerably; b) all three wire mesh columns would have drastically reduced any air convection within them, reducing both evaporation rate as well as the speed with which the gas spreads out into the chamber; c) due to high humidity in the air and the lack of air convection, moisture would have condensed intensively on the Zyklon B carrier, reducing the evaporation rate of HCN “ seriously .” The present study regarding homicidal mass gassings will be based on the conservative assumption that the Zyklon B would at best have behave in the manner described by Irmscher at 15°C (see above). 7.3.

For a clarification of the eviden ce problems, an extract from the judgment of the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial may be quoted here: 83 “The court lacked almost all possib ilities of discovery available in a normal murder trial to create a true picture of the actual event at the time of the murder. It lacked the bodies of the victims, autopsy records, expert reports on the cause of death and the time of death; it lacked any trace of the murderers, murder we apons, etc. An examination of the eye- witness testimony was only possible in rare cases. Where the slightest doubt existed or the possibility of a confusion could not be excluded with certainty, the court did not evaluate the testimony of witnesses [...] The general findings [...] are based on [...] the credible testimony of witnesses [...] Böck, in addition to the written notes of the first camp commandant Höß.” In the opinion of the court, many of the witness testimonies pos- sessed insufficient credibility. But it nevertheless succeeded in obtain- ing testimonies from a few allegedly credible witnesses that sounded sufficiently credible to the court. Before we analyze some of these testimonies more closely, a few remarks are necessary about the circumstances and the atmosphere in which these testimonies and confessions of alleged victims and perpe- trators came about in the first couple of years after the end of World War II. It was in those years that the story of the conveyor-belt like extermination of human beings in Auschwitz and elsewhere was ele- vated to ‘common knowledge.’ Challe nging this story led to a severe increase in legal penalty for any defendant, as it still does to this day in many countries in Europe. According to reports by Bernard Clarke, who arrested Höß at that time, Höß was tortured after his arrest. 431 In his autobiography, Höß also reports this and mentioned similar procedures during his Polish   430 See, in this regard, the ex cellent analysis of J.

Eyewitness Fantasies What is the credibility of the ey ewitness testimonies as to content? Reference should be made at this poi nt to a few detailed works on this problem. 437 The following is a closer examination of three of the more frequently quoted eyewitnesses: Rudolf Höß, former camp comman- dant at Auschwitz, Richard Böck, a camp SS man of subordinate rank, as well as Henryk Tauber, former inmate and member of the “ Sonder- kommando ” in crematorium II in Birkenau. The Höß statements may be consulted in the Broszat edition and read as follows: 295 “Maintaining the fire at the ditches, pouring the collected fat [over the burning bodies ...] They ate and smoked while dragging corpses [...] ” (p. 126) “The bodies were doused first with oil residues, and later with methanol [...] He also attempted to destroy the bodies with explo- sives, [...] ” (p. 157ff.)   434 Reprinted in its entirety in T.

[...] ” Anyone who has ever grilled meat knows that fat cannot be scooped up from burning flesh. Fat ignites at approximately 184°C. 439 It is therefore the first thing that burns on a corpse located in a fire. Hence, it is impossible to collect the easily combustible fat during the incineration of a corpse. After all, the bodies were burnt—not grilled. The incineration of corpses in the open air with combustible fluids is impracticable because fluids have the property of flowing down or away and/or evaporating. When corpses, which consist of more than 60% water, are burnt, this must take place with the expenditure of quite large quantities of fuel and great heat. In particular, open oil or meth- ane combustion would be insufficient. The alleged attempt to destroy bodies by means of explosives re- quires no further comment. In reading such testimonies, one must in- evitably wonder as to Höß’s mental condition in writing them, as well as that of anyone who takes such claims seriously. Unfortunately, such testimonies are the rule rather than the exception. 440 Entering the ‘gas chamber’ without a protective filter, eating and smoking in the ‘gas chamber’, as well as the commencement of the corpse dragging operation immediately after the opening of the doors, would only be conceivable if th ere were no longer any dangerous   438 Henry Friedländer, The Holocaust , Vol. 12: “ The ‘finale solution’ in the extermination camps and the aftermath ”, Garland, New York 1982, p. 113, Testimony of R.

The question of whether this was pos- sible will be the subject of chapter 7.3.2.2. It is interesting to note that M. Broszat deleted the last pages of Rudolf Höß’s testimony from his edition, since they contain “ com- pletely erroneous data on the numerical strength of these Jews ”, as Broszat himself stated in a footnot e. In these pages, Höß speaks of three million Jews in Hungary, four million in Romania, two million in Bulgaria. The actual figures were lower by a factor of approximately ten. 441 In addition, the same pages contain the following, which is also incredible: 442 “Although well-cared for and plentifully provided with bonus pay- ments, one often saw them [the Jewish Sonderkommandos] dragging corpses with one hand, and holding and gnawing on something to eat with the other hand. Even during the horrid work of digging up and burning the mass graves, they did not allow themselves to be disturbed while eating. Even the burning of their closest relatives could not shake them. [...] ” This is really a bit hard to digest. Another commonly quoted witness is Henryk Tauber. Tauber was, according to his own testimony, a member of the inmate Sonderkom- mando of crematorium II during the war. J.-C. Pressac writes that this eyewitness testimony is the best in relation to the crematoria, which he considers to be 95% reliable. This testimony contains the following: 443 “During the incineration of such [not emaciated] corpses, we used the coke only to light the fire of the furnace initially, for fatty corpses burned of their own accord thanks to the combustion of the body fat. On occasion, when coke was in short supply, we would put some straw and wood in the ash bins under the muffles, and once the fat of the corpse be- gan to burn the other corpses would catch light themselves.

So, dur- ing the incineration of fat bodies, the fires were generally extinguished. [...] Another time, the SS chased a prisoner who was not working fast enough into a pit near the cremator ium that was full of boiling human fat. At that time [summer 1944] , the corpses were incinerated in open-air pits, from which the fat flowed into a separate reservoir, dug in the ground. This fat was poured over the corpses to accelerate their combus- tion. [...] ” Tauber’s claims as to self-igniting, self-combustible corpses are completely absurd, and in contradic tion to all the laws of physical and technical sciences. 444 He also confuses grilling with burning with rela- tion to the allegedly boiling fat from the corpses. What is more, fat cannot boil at all. It simply begins to ignite at temperatures of ap- proximately 180-190°C. Tauber also proves himself a liar in the technical details related by him. The combustion gases in a crematorium oven stream from the combustion chamber 445 through the cremation chamber containing the corpse (muffle), through the ash cham ber into the flue, which conducts the exhaust gases to the chimney. 446 If a fire had been ignited in the ash chamber to burn the bodies located above, this would have reversed the flow of gas: fresh air would have been sucked in through the chimney, while the exhaust gases would have flowed through the muffle into the combustion chamber, from which they would have found their way out into the oven room. Starting the fire in the ash chamber, as described by Tauber, would have been disastrous. On top of this, Tauber also claims that the Sonderkommandos shoved extraordinarily many corpses into each oven (up to eight) when they heard Allied planes approaching. Tauber claims that by so doing, huge flames would have come out of the crematorium’s chimney, which they hoped would make the A llied bomber pilots aware of them. But as is common knowledge and has been pointed out many times, no   444 On the energy requirements in general and in th e crematoria of Auschwitz in particular, see C. Mattogno and F.

It is also impossible to push eight corpses in an cremation muffle whose door is just two feet wide and high. 447 And apart from that, before Tauber and his co- inmates would have been able to push eight corpses into each oven and get a huge blaze going, any plane they claim to have heard approach- ing would have long flown far, far away. Such testimonies are, to use Pressac’s words, nothing but downright lies and pure invention. 448 Now to the testimony of the witness Richard Böck as quoted dur- ing the Frankfurt tribunal: 297 “One day, it was during the winter of 1942/43, H. asked me, whether I wanted to drive with him to a gassing action. [...] The transport train, which had already arrived, stood on the free stretch of track. [...] They were all loaded, and driven to a former farmhouse. [...] After the entire transport—there must have been approximately 1,000 people—was in the building, the door was closed. Finally, an SS man came, I believe it was a Rottenf ührer, to our ambulance and got out a gas canister. He then went to a ladder with this gas canister. [...] At the same time, I noticed that he had a gas mask on while climbing the ladder. [...] he shook [...] the contents of the canister into the opening. [...] When he had closed the little door again, an inde scribable crying began in the chamber. [...] That lasted approximately 8-10 minutes, and then all was silent. A short time afterwards, the door was opened by in- mates and one could see a bluish cloud floating over a gigantic pile of corpses. [...] At any rate, I was surprised that the inmate commando which was assigned to remove the bodies, entered the chamber without gas masks, although this blue vapor floated over the corpses, from which I assumed that it was a gas. [...] ” In winter of 1942/1943, no crematorium was operable in Birkenau (the first became operable in spring 1943). For this reason, the alleged victims of homicidal mass gassings in a farmhouse as attested to by Böck are supposed to have been cremat ed in open-air pits close to this farmhouse. In view of our previous study of the subject, we can establish: • According to professional air photo analyses of the decisive loca-   447 On cremation technology, see C. Mattogno and F.

Tauber."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 204 tions, there were no large cremation ditches, no fuel stockpile, no development of smoke or flames. 449 Accordingly, the scenario of destruction is obviously false in this regard. • One thousand people occupy a surface area of at least 200 m 2 . Ac- cording to eyewitness testimonies, the farmhouses had only half this much surface area, at the most. 450 • Chapter 7.1.: Hydrogen cyanide is a colorless, invisible gas. Therefore, no “ blue vapor floating over the corpses ” could be seen. This passage is a sign of pure fantasy, obviously suggested by the German name of HCN, “ Blausäure ” (blue acid), which only relates, however, to the formation of the pigment Iron Blue. • Chapter 7.2.: Since the events d escribed are alleged to have taken place in winter, the rapidity of th e procedure is incredible, since Zyklon B only releases gas slowly at frost temperatures. • The described entry into chambe rs with a high concentration of toxic gas without a protective filter is impossible; such a manner of procedure would obviously sooner or later be fatal. German public prosecutor Willy Dr eßen had the following to say about Böck’s testimony: 451 “Dear Mr. [...] , I enclose a copy of the eyewitness te stimonies of former members of the SS on the gassing of inmates at Auschwitz [...] for your information. They are only a selection—there are numerous other such testimonies. In contrast to yourself, I am of the opinion that these eyewitness testimonies relating to the fact of the occurrence of gassings of human beings, are entirely suitable to refute the denial of this fact.

And yet it is entirely incredible. Pressac himself becomes very critical in quite a few of his pas- sages relating to the reliability and credibility of eyewitness testimo- nies; 452 yet it is upon these eyewitness testimonies that all the descrip- tions of the ‘gas chamber’ killings ar e based. He lists the untruths, im- possibilities, and exaggerations of the witnesses and explains how they presumably materialized. Finally, in an interview, he said: 453 “No, no. One cannot write seri ous history based only upon eyewit- ness testimonies.” At the same time, however, he bases all of his remarks on the al- leged existence of homicidal ‘gas chambers’ exclusively on these eye- witness testimonies! And elsewhere, he states, with a naiveté which can hardly be surpassed: 454 “Witnesses never lie, but they can be mistaken.” Pressac seems to be the only person of the establishment who takes notice of the progress of revisionist research. He knows that tra- ditional historiography of the Holocau st is reduced to absurdity by the facts revealed by this research. C onsequently, he keeps changing his attitude when making public statements. The most vehement attack of the media darling Pressac on the dominating historiography occurred during an interview published as an appendix to a PhD thesis analyzing the history of Holocaust revisionism in France. In it, Pressac described the established historiography of the Holocaust as “ rotten ” and stated: 455 “Can we alter the course? It is too late.

Only little.” In his first and so far most comprehensive book, Pressac is com- pelled to correct the statements of witnesses in many cases in order to eliminate errors and, in his opinion, technical impossibilities. But when so doing, he never reveals the basis upon which he undertakes these corrections. In actual fact, he merely replaces the capriciousness of ‘eyewitnesses’ with his own. Thus, the numbers of victims per gassing procedure, as estimated by Pressac, for example, are considerably lower than those estimated in th e eyewitness statements, which often speak of several thousand victims per gassing operation per day for crematoria II and III. One thousand people could only have been made to enter a cellar with a surface area of 210 m 2 under the maintenance of extraordinary discipline accompanie d by a readiness to co-operate(!) on the part of the victims (see chapter 7.3.2.1.1.). The numbers of peo- ple reported in places by witnesses, on the other hand (2,000 and more 456 ) could not have been contained by morgue 1. To arrive at the number of victims of Auschwitz-Birkenau, as spread by sensationalist media and literature until the late 1980s—four million—one is in fact compelled to resort to technically impossible figures of ‘gas chamber’ occupancy, as the witnesses do. At the moment, the official estimates range from approximately 1 to 1½ million victims, 457 though in his second book, Pressac downgraded the ‘gas chamber’ victims to 630,000 458 and later even further down to 470,000-550,000, 459 and in an article published in a small German periodical in early 2002, a German mainstream journalist attempted to reduce the death toll of the Auschwitz ‘gas chambers’ down to as little as 356,000. 460 But as long as this revolutionary development is not accepted by most scholars, we will stick to the number of one million ‘gas chamber’ victims for all further considerations.   456 2,000 according to R.

It must therefore be considered established that quantities of at least 20 kg of Zyklon B per gassing (ten 2 kg cans or twenty 1 kg cans) would probably have had to have been used for the gassing procedures described. Let us state that the scenarios described by the witnesses would require a quick increase in the concentration of hydrogen cyanide eve- rywhere in the chamber. At the same time, logically, there cannot have been a simultaneous drop in the hydrogen cyanide in the chamber— such as through the respiration of the victims. Such a loss in hydrogen cyanide would have had to have b een overcompensated for through an even more rapid evaporation of fresh hydrogen cyanide, because the hydrogen cyanide concentration would have had to increase for rapid executions. After the end of respiration due to increasing numbers of dead victims, who died in a matter of minutes, this most important cause of a loss in hydrogen cyanide would have ceased to exist as a factor. But since Zyklon B continues to give off large amounts of hy- drogen cyanide for many more minutes, it must be assumed that the hydrogen cyanide content in such chambers would continue to increase constantly, and very rapidly, during the first quarter hour at least. Since deadly concentrations (3,200 ppm) would have had to have been reached even in the remo test corner of the chamber even after a few minutes, this means that the hydrogen cyanide concentration inside the chamber after approximately one quarter hour would have exceeded 10,000 ppm and would have continue d to rise thereafter—slowly, of course, but nevertheless constantly at all times. To assume that the respiration of the victims locked in the cham- bers would have been capable of perceptibly reducing the concentra- tion of hydrogen cyanide in the air is therefore entirely in contradiction to the eyewitness statements. 468 In particular, this would have to as- sume that the victims, confined in the chamber, could have acted as quasi-living filters for the greater proportion of the time during which the Zyklon B was releasing hydrogen cyanide (at least one hour). But one thousand people locked in a herm etically sealed cellar would have died in an hour from lack of oxygen alone. These considerations show that a concentration of hydrogen cya-   468 Such is, for example, the hypothesis brought forth by G. Wellers, op. cit.

Z YKLON B FOR THE K ILLING OF H UMAN B EINGS 211 nide in morgue 1 of crematoria II and III during the alleged gassings would have had an effect on the m asonry which would have been at least as great as that occurring during disinfestation. High rates of hy- drogen cyanide absorption would have to be expected during these pe- riods, particularly on the cool and mo ist masonry of cellars in cremato- ria II and III. The duration of the gassing period would have depended above all on the subsequent ventilati on, which will be examined below. 7.3.1.3.2. Excursus 1: Poisoning or Suffocation? Because eyewitness statements about the amount of Zyklon B are rare, and since humans are more sensitive to HCN than insects (see chapter 7.1.), some scholars opine that only small amounts of Zyklon B were used for the alleged mass mu rders in Auschwitz, for example J. Bailer, 54 W. Wegner, 49 and G. Wellers, 55 who assume an applied con- centration of 1 g per m 3 (0.083 Vol.%) or less. The few witnesses statements we have, however, claim that sev- eral kilograms of Zyklon B were used. 469 In his book, Pressac fre- quently refers to a HCN concentration of 12 g per m 3 or 1 vol.% used for executions. 470 He backs this up with many witness accounts, ac- cording to which four to six 1-kg cans of Zyklon B were allegedly poured into the ‘gas chambers’ (morgues) of crematorium II and III, which indeed corresponds to a concentration of 1 vol.%. 302 Pressac, on the other hand, assumes that 95 to 98% of the entire Zyklon B delivered to the camp were used for the original purpose, i.e. , for delousing clothes and rooms, 471 for which he relies on statements from the Nuremberg tribunal. 472 Pressac justifies this with the fact that, in relation to other concentration camps, where doubtlessly no exter-   469 J.

Desjardin: “ Kenneth Stern’s Critique of The Leuchter Report : A Critical Analysis ”, online: codoh.com/newrevoices/nddd/ndddstern.html. The analysis does not, however, take account of the slow release of hydrogen cyanide by the car- rier material. See also Desjardin’s interview with F. Piper, op. cit.

The supply figures of the Auschwitz camp can be found in the protocols of the International Military Tribunal Nuremberg. In total, they reached some 19,000 kg during the years 1942 and 1943. 157 The total supplied amount during the entire existence of the camp from late 1940 to early 1945 will hardly have exceeded 40 tons. According to Pressac’s statement that not 2-5% of this was used for killings, 800 to 2,000 kg of the total delivery was used for extermination of humans. But when dividing up this amount of Zyklon B for one million people allegedly killed with it, with 1,000 victims per gassing—the ‘gas chambers’ (morgues I) of crematorium II and III could hardly hold 1,000 persons per execution—only roughly 0.8 to 2 kg HCN was available for each gassing. With the morgues’ free volume of roughly 430 m 3 , 466 and after all hydrogen cyanide had evaporated from the car- rier (after more than an hour), 800 to 2,000 g of hydrogen cyanide would result in a theoretical end c oncentration of 1.86 to 4.65 g per m 3 , which means that the concentration during the first five or ten minutes was much lower. If, on the other hand, one million victims were killed according to the eyewitness statements, i.e. , with high concentrations in a few min- utes, those 1,000 gassing would ha ve required 1,000×20 kg = 20 tons of Zyklon B, or at least 50% of the entire Zyklon B delivery to the camp. This shows an obvious inconsistency in Pressac’s statements. One cannot have both high concentrations during homicidal gassings and a low percentage of the entire Zyklon B delivery to Auschwitz used for these gassings. Let us now have a closer look at the theory endorsed by J. Bailer, 54 W. Wegner, 49 and G. Wellers, 55 that only a small amount of HCN was used for the killings. In such a case, the concentration reduction due to the respiration of the victims is no longer a negligible quantity. Per capita, the respiration of HCN is the higher, the higher the ap- plied concentration is. The reason fo r this is that although the victim incorporates lethal amounts of hydrogen cyanide in short periods of time in case of high concentrations, their organism’s reaction is de- layed. During this delay, the victim incorporates more overdoses of"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"7. Z YKLON B FOR THE K ILLING OF H UMAN B EINGS 213 hydrogen cyanide. Graph 10 shows the behavior of the breathing volume per minute of persons dying of suffocation or poisoning (biochemical suffoca- tions). Respiratory arrest occurs at the end of this period of time (at 5). Death occurs only several minutes after respiratory arrest. If one as- sumes a time period of 5 minutes until respiratory arrest, the assumed breathing volume during each single minute is: 1.: 20 l; 2.: 30 l; 3.: 50 l; 4.: 80 l; 5.: 30 l. 422 In total, this yields a breathing volume of ca. 210 l. Furthermore, we assume that the function is independent of the length of time until respiratory arrest. This means that the double amount of air is inhaled if the time period would be doubled. Regarding morgue 1 (‘gas chamber’) of crematorium II, we have the following data: Volume: 504 m 3 ; volume of 1,000 persons: ca. 75 m 3 ; resulting free air volume: ca. 430 m 3 . First, the oxygen content in the room may be studied. In Table 9, the total inhaled volume of 1,000 victims is given in m 3 and multiples of the free air volume as a func- tion of time. The average oxygen content is reduced by 20-30% per inhalation. This results in the remaining oxygen content in the chamber as given in the last two columns. Oxygen contents below 6% are le- thal. 473 So, even without adding any toxic gas, we have to reckon with the victims being suffocated in an ai rtight chamber already after some 45-60 minutes. If one increases the number of locked-up persons, this process is accelerated accord- ingly. However, if there were Zyklon B holes in the morgues I of cre- matorium II and III during wartime, con- trary to the results achieved before, these rooms could not be sealed off in an air tight   473 Y.

Also, small amounts of air would have seeped into the interior through the ventilation shafts. Due to the extremely high capability of the lungs to absorb HCN, the human lung acts like a perfect filter which absorbs all hydrogen cyanide out of the air. Taking the experiences of US execution ‘gas chamber’ as a base, death occurs af ter some 10 minutes at the earliest in case of an application of ca. 4 g HCN per m 3 . In assuming a total inhaled volume of ca. 210 l, this corresponds to an incorporated amount of HCN of ca. 800 mg, which is a tenfold overdose of the le- thal dose (80 mg/person). In the fo llowing, it is assumed that an execu- tion lasting several hours, no overdoses of HCN are incorporated. Us- ing these benchmark figures, a relation be- tween incorporated overdose and execution time results as shown in Graph 11. The HCN content in the air of a room decreases similarly by breathing as by ventila- tion (exponential be- havior, see chapter 7.3.2.2.2.).

Z YKLON B FOR THE K ILLING OF H UMAN B EINGS 215 once, the HCN content will be reduced to ca. 37% of the initial value. As a function of time passed until respiratory arrest occurs, Table 10 shows, how much HCN was incorporated by the victims in total (col- umn 3), which portion of the total content of HCN in the air this is (column 4), how much HCN had been released in total (column 5), and how much Zyklon B at a carrier temperature of 15°C had to have been applied to release that much HCN as is required in this period of time. The last column shows the ratio of the inhaled amount of HCN and the applied amount. In so doing, it was assumed that the HCN concentra- tion was available to every victim right from the start. In reality, the applied amount of hydrogen cyanide had to be a bit higher than as- sumed here (delay due to release and distribution of hydrogen cya- nide). According to testimonies, the execution times until all victims were dead were shorter than 10 minutes. 465 When considering the de- lays caused by the release of the gas and its distribution, as well as the fact that death occurs only several minutes after respiratory arrest, the first two lines of Table 10, corresponding to execution times of ca. 10 and 15 minutes, respectively, are at the upper limit of witness accounts. This means that an execution within a few moments or minutes would have required enormous amounts of Zyklon B. Such witness accounts are therefore unrealistic. Furthermore, it must be assumed that, with the execution times attested to, only a fraction of the applied (<10%) and at the execution time released amount of hydrogen cyanide (<60%) actually could have been incorporated by the victims.

Therefore, one has to reckon with high adsorption rates of hydrogen cyanide es- pecially at the cool and wet walls of the cellars of crematorium II and III, contrary to Weller’s hypothesis, according to which this is not sup- posed to happen. 55 According to his opinion, the little amounts of hy- drogen cyanide applied were supposedly inhaled entirely. This contra- dicts the witness accounts of the quick ‘gas chamber’ death which re- quired large amounts of hydrogen cyanide. Finally, the application of small amounts of hydrogen cyanide of an end concentration of only 1g/m³, i.e. , the use of only some 400 g Zyklon B per gassing, would have been senseless, if the facilities were indeed air-tight, which would have been imperative for their use as a mass ‘gas chamber’. This is, because the victims would have died in a similar period of time due to lack of oxygen anyway (cf. Table 9). 7.3.1.3.3.

For the sake of clarity, only the concentration behavior in the center of the room is reproduced in Graph 12. The loss of hydrogen cyanide as a function of temperature in a dis- infestation chamber can be seen in Graph 14. The higher losses at lower temperatures is caused by a higher moisture content in the gassed material and in the walls of the observed room. 123 According to the already quoted publication by Schwarz et al. , 409 their measurements were made in the range of room temperature.

In order to kill all victims quickly, as attested to by the ‘eyewit- nesses’, such losses would have to be compensated by introducing even more HCN than calculated before (chapter 7.3.1.3.1. and 7.3.1.3.3.) in order to quickly reach and maintain high HCN concentra- tions everywhere in the ‘gas chamber.’ 7.3.2. Critique of the Eyewitness Descriptions 7.3.2.1. Theatre of the Absurd First, a few critical remarks on three topics of eyewitness statements relating to homicidal mass gassings should be made at this point. 7.3.2.1.1. Necessity of Co-Operation Just imagine the following scene: 1,000 people of both sexes plus children enter the undressing room with a surface area of 390 m 2 (4,200 ft²). Each one would therefore have a area of only 60 cm × 60 cm (2×2 ft) in which to undress. Experience shows that people do not pack themselves tightly to the very e dge of an enclosed area, unless, of course, they are quite willing to do so. 474 In order to get people to do this, the procedure must be rehearsed; they must be aware of what is happening and what steps they must follow—and they must be willing to co-operate. Alternatively, few people could be made to undress at a time, but this assumes that the people who ha ve already undressed are in the ‘gas   474 Just think of street cars or buses, where ever yone remains near the door, even though there is plenty of room at the rear."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"7. Z YKLON B FOR THE K ILLING OF H UMAN B EINGS 219 chamber’ and waiting patiently for th e next arrival of naked inmates. Once inside the ‘gas chamber’, the same problem occurs again. Here each individual has only an area of 45 cm × 45 cm (1.5×1.5 ft) in which to stand. The people must press themselves tightly together; the first people entering the room must proceed to the end of the room in a disciplined manner and line up against the wall. The next lot will form the line directly in front, and so on, until the entire chamber is full, which must have taken approximately half an hour, even with perfect choreography. How did they get these 1,000 people to pack themselves tightly together, as one can expect it from sold iers who have exercised this for weeks on a parade ground? The only solution is that this must have been exercised just as intensively a nd disciplined as soldiers do it. And of course, at some point in this alleged scenario, people had to realize that they were not gathering for a shower, thus resulting in panic and lack of orderly cooperation with their murderers’ procedures. 7.3.2.1.2. Failure to Separate the Sexes All eyewitness accounts known to the author are unanimous in claiming that the victims were not separated by sex before being sent into the ‘gas chambers’. The eyew itness accounts of the failure to sepa- rate the sexes are incredible for the following four reasons: 1. This procedure is in contradiction to the procedures followed during disinfestation, where, according to the same witnesses, the sexes were carefully separated. 475 2. Since there were always two alleged ‘gas chambers’ of each type available in Birkenau (in crematorium II and III, or IV and V, or bunker I and II), there is no apparent reason why the victims could not have been separated by sex. 3. The claims were repeatedly made that the victims were made to believe that they were going to shower or undergo disinfestation. These procedures would have necessarily separated the populace on the basis of sex, if only becau se of the need for deception. 4. Particularly in the 1940s of last century, large numbers of people could only have been made to disrobe completely with others   475 See, for example, the pictures taken by th e SS before and after delousing new arriving in- mates, neatly separated by sex, as published in the Serge Klarsfeld (ed.), The Auschwitz Al- bum.

But this would have nullified all the other measures of con- cealment. 7.3.2.1.3. Towel and Soap According to a few eyewitnesses, the victims were handed towels and bars of soap to make them belie ve that they were going to take a shower. 476 (Who, by the way, would go with a towel under a shower?) This statement becomes incredible given the chaos in the ‘gas cham- ber’: 1,000 corpses, 1,000 towels, and 1,000 bars of soap, plus vomit, urine, and blood from 1,000 victims! How was it possible to recycle those 1,000 bars of soap? How did they clean 1,000 towels? Did they waste 1,000 towels and 1,000 soap bars for every gassing? It can there- fore be concluded that such accounts are untrue, and witnesses testify- ing about it are not trustworthy. 477 7.3.2.2. Speed of Ventilation of the ‘Gas Chambers’ 7.3.2.2.1. Introduction An imaginary experiment may perhaps assist in clarifying a somewhat complicated mathematical relationship: you have a bucket filled to the brim with sea water in front of you. You now take a sec- ond bucket filled with fresh water and pour it very carefully into the first bucket, allowing the excess flow over the edge. Now the question: when you have emptied the second bucket of fresh water into the first, containing sea water, what is the composition of the water in the first bucket? Pure fresh water? Of course not. It will be a mixture of salt and fresh water. 7.3.2.2.2. Excursus In mathematics, the equation related to this problem is called a linear, homogenous differential equation. In general, the following time behavior applies for the concentra- tion change of a substance i with time, dc i /dt, in case of air exchange,   476 Cf. the testimony of Andr é Lettich, Thêse Fac.

The modification of the equation yields: ⌡ ⌠ 1 c i (t) dc i = ⌡ ⌠ − a · dt (9) After integration over dc and dt, resp., this yields: ln(c i (t)) = a' − a · t (10) or c i (t) = a\"· e − at .

Therefore, a is the reciprocal of the air exchange time: a = 1 exchange time . (17) After a single air exchange, the concentration is: c i (t) = c o · e − 1 ≈ 0.37 · c o . (18) For the 1 /x-value period (time period in which the concentration drops to 1 /x) the following applies accordingly: t 1 /x = ln( 1 / x ) –a .   (19)   Example: If it is required to lower the value down to 1% of the ini- tial value (12 g per m3, 1 Vol.%, down to 120 mg hydrogen cyanide per m3, 0.01 Vol.%), i.e., down to 1/100 of the initial value, this results to: t 1 /100 = ln( 1 / 100 ) –a ≈ 4.6 × air exchange time. (20) The half-value period is: t ½ ≈ 0.693 –a .   (21)   Therefore, the concentration has dropped down to half after roughly 2/3 of a complete air exchange. This is true, if the fresh and the old air are mixed perfectly. However, this is not necessarily the case, as there are two other possible scenarios: 1. Exchange of old gas only (linear, laminar flow along the entire cross-section of the room): air exchange time roughly identical with ventilation time: Technically not given in the facilities under consideration. 2. Exchange of mainly fresh gas (exhaust close to intake), areas of old gas partly not involved: ventilation time is a multiple of what"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"7. Z YKLON B FOR THE K ILLING OF H UMAN B EINGS 223 is described above. In our case, this is certainly given for the areas between the corpses, since here almost no mixing of the gases takes place. Additionally, the unfavorable location of the air in- takes to the exhausts leads to a pa rtial exchange of fresh gas (air short circuit). This increases the ventilation time by a factor two to four or more. The following chapter will determine, which scenario was given in the alleged ‘gas chambers’. 7.3.2.2.3. Ventilation of the Morgues of Crematorium II and III As shown above, when fresh air and stale air mix together, the concentration of the latter falls to only approximately 37% of the initial value after one complete air excha nge, and to approximately 14% after a second exchange. Data are only available on the ventilation installations in cremato- ria II and III, so that at this point we have to ignore all other ‘gas chambers’ in this regard. 478 In chapter 5.4.1.2.4., the ventilation capac- ity of morgues 1 of crematoria II and III was shown to have been 4,800 m 3 per hour. With a volume of free air in the morgue 1 of 430 m 3 , the volume of the room would be exchanged once in approximately 5-6 minutes. 466 For morgues 1 of crematoria II and III under consideration at this point, however, a further problem arises. In particular, the ventilation intake has been installed only approximately 2 m away from the ventila- tion outlet in the same wall. The distance to the ventilation outlet on the opposite wall, however, is 7.3 m, i.e. , 3.5 times as far. The result, in these cellars, is a ‘ventilation short circ uit’, especially if we assume that the victims of the alleged mass extermination are all tightly crammed together, especially in the middle of the room, which would further lengthen the fresh air pathway from one side of the cellar to the other. The air blown into the ventilation in take openings would therefore, for the most part, be immediately sucked out through the ventilation outlet openings located nearby. 479 Therefore, it must be expected that the actual ventilation time would be greatly increased in comparison to a perfect mixing of fresh air and stale air as a result of this poor design.   478 Crematorium I is deliberately left out of th e discussion, since the mass murders allegedly committed there have, in the meantime, af ter all, been generally questioned. 479 A reasonable regulation would have been to in stall the ventilation inlets on one side of the room, and the ventilation outlets on the other side."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 224 In addition, the following problem would also arise: the Zyklon B granules, which in the meantime would certainly have become moist, would lie trapped underneath the bodies in at least some places. To understand how this would effect the ventilation, we have carried out a simulation calculation based on the following assumption: 1. At 15°C, the moist Zyklon B releases hydrogen cyanide in the dry environment in the manner described by R. Irmscher (see chapter 7.2.). 2. Reaching an average concentration of hydrogen cyanide through- out the entire chamber of approximately 5-6 g/m³ after 5 minutes and/or approximately 10-12 g/m³ after 10 minutes (0.5 or 1 Vol.- %)—necessary for the rapid killing of all victims according to the eyewitnesses—requires the use of approximately 20 kg of Zyklon B (see chapter 7.3.1.3.). 3. The ventilation is turned on after 10 minutes, reducing the concen- tration of hydrogen cyanide according to the well-known formula (see chapter 7.3.2.2.2.) The results may be taken from the Graph 15 for four air exchanges 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 t [m in] c(HCN) [g/m³] one air exchange each 96 min. one air exchange each 24 min. one air exchange each 12 min. one air exchange each 6 min.

The value for 5g/m 3 indicates, when the HCN con- centration falls below a value at whic h it is possible to enter the cham- ber with a gas mask, but without protective garment and without per- forming physical work. The value for 2g/m 3 should lie in the vicinity of a value permitting light physical work with a gas mask, but without protective garment. The value for 0.1g/m 3 indicates when the HCN concentration falls below a concentration permitting entry of the chamber without a gas mask and without any health hazard. The col- umn with the heading “ ∫ c(t) dt/10g/m 3 ” finally corresponds to a tenth of the surface area under the particular curve. The value corresponds to the duration of a hypothetical gassing of a chamber with a constant 10g/m 3 HCN, when the hydrogen cyanide suddenly rises at the begin- ning of this period of time and then suddenly disappears at the end of this period. These values can now be used for simulation calculations; see next chapter. The 6 min/air exchange applies in the absence of a short circuit of the air in the chamber. The 12 min/ air exchange corresponds to this necessary correction. Both cases assume an empty chamber.

It may be considered established that under no circumstances could these cellars be entered without a gas mask in less than 3-4 hours after the beginning of the gassing. Ha rd physical work with gas masks, but without protective clothes, i.e. , the alleged removal of the bodies, would not have been possible in less than 1 1 / 2 to 2 hours. If assuming the existence of Zyklon B introduction devices which allowed the removal of Zyklon after the end of the gassing, the result- ing data would, of course, look dramatically different, see Table 12. Under such circumstances, it might ha ve been possible to enter the ‘gas chamber’ with a gas mask for hard labor already after 30 to 45 min- utes, and without a gas mask within one to two hours. This would then lie at least within the range of some less extravagant eyewitness ac- counts. That explains also, why Pressac and van Pelt insist on the exis- tence of these introduction columns, contrary to all physical evidence and despite the lack of any documentary proof and reliable witness testimony. Without those introduction columns, however, the scenarios described by eyewitnesses regarding a swift removal of the corpses from the ‘gas chamber’ after the gassing are simply impossible.

Z YKLON B FOR THE K ILLING OF H UMAN B EINGS 227 me whether I would rely upon these values and enter such a ‘gas chamber’ without a gas mask, I would reply that I preferred to insist upon the performance of a traditional chemical test beforehand. The simple reason for this is that all reliable calculation would be rendered impossible by the Zyklon B trapped beneath the bodies, as well as by the wet bodies moistened with hydrogen cyanide. The rooms in crematoria IV and V which purportedly served as ‘gas chambers,’ like farmhouses I and II, allegedly had no ventilation installation and only slight ventilation possibilities by means of a few doors. The use of a room without efficient ventilation installations for mass murder at a time and in a place, where even dissecting rooms, wash rooms, and laying-out rooms could be and were equipped with ventilation installations, and where many ventilation fans were supply- ing lots of fresh air in disinfestation rooms right next door, is so absurd that any rational human being ought to refuse to take such stories seri- ously. 7.3.2.3. Simulation Calculations The following are the results a series of simulation calculations for the determination of the relative saturation of the masonry with hydro- gen cyanide based on the assumption that similar concentrations of hydrogen cyanide are used in all cases. In so doing, a distinction is made between two sets of circumstances: 1. Disinfestation chamber. The constant concentration assumed for the calculation amounts to 10 g/m³. A constant concentration cannot, however, be assumed, particularly for the existing epidemic disinfesta- tion installations BW 5a und 5b existing in Birkenau, since great quan- tities of hydrogen cyanide would escape through the non-airtight roof on the one hand, and since both the masonry and the clothing would have absorbed considerable quantities of hydrogen cyanide over time (see chapter 7.3.1.3.3.). We therefore assume two models, as follows: a) one gassing daily with a constant concentration over 6 hours, and b) one gassing daily with 12 hours of constant concentration. 481 This   481 In order to keep the HCN concentration in thos e make-shift delousing chambers of BW 5a and BW 5b constant over 12 hours, this would have required the application of an initial concen- tration at least twice or thrice as high as 10 g/ m², but this would have been impossible due to lack of sufficient Zyklon B. The quantities of Zyklon B necessary for such use would have corresponded to 24 to 30 kg per day, or approxima tely 9 to 11 tons per year, which is roughly the total quantity delivered to the camp, leaving no HCN for homicidal gassings. Hence, this"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 228 would mean that the chamber was used around the clock, i.e. , more or less 24 hours a day, seven days a week, which must be viewed as the extreme upper value. 2. Homicidal ‘gas chamber.’ Here as well, our calculation assumes a constant concentration of 10 g/m³ . I have selected two different gas- sing times here: 1/20 day (72 min) and 1/100 of a day (14.4 min). The first value corresponds to the average constant exposure time of ‘gas chamber’ walls to HCN if assuming no Zyklon B introduction columns and a fairly good ventilation after the gassing (see 5 th column in Table 11), the second value corresponds to the same scenario, but this time with Zyklon B columns and a close to perfect ventilation after the gas- sing (see 5 th column in Table 12). In former editions of this expert report, I have used the equations determined in chapter 6.7.4. to cal culate the relative saturation of ma- sonry cyclically exposed to hydrogen cyanide. However, after using several approaches on exactly how to do it, which lead to sometimes quite different results, 482 I decided to refer to this equation only in or- der to establish the time it takes for masonry to reach its maximum saturation or a quasi-constant concen tration (20 days and 20 daily cy- cles, respectively). In this edition, the quasi-stationary concentration in masonry were calculated iterativel y using Fick’s law of diffusion. 483 One wall model used was considered to be insulated at one end that corresponds to the situation as given in morgues 1 of crematoria II and III, which were built of two laye rs of brick wall with a insulating layer of tar in between. 484 The other wall model had no such insulation, i.e. , it lost HCN on its ‘outside,’ leading to an average concentration within the entire wall which is roughly half as high as in the insulated case. This was the situation as it was given in the Zyklon B disinfesta- tion rooms of BW 5a and BW 5b. Table 13 shows the results of these calculations. Whereas the av-   scenario is unrealistic for our purposes, because our scenario requires homicidal gassings; see also chapter 7.3.1.3. 482 The equations determined in chapter 6.7.4. c onsist of two terms, which can be handled indi- vidually or both together, and it is not at all cl ear, which time value is to be used when switch- ing over from gassing to airing, which all influences the result. 483 I am not going to explain basic statistical la ws of diffusion here. This law is so commonly known that anybody interested in it might look it up in any physics book. Maybe the iterative steps I used where a bit too big, so there is an error margin in my calculati ons, but if so, it af- fects all series, so it should not make a difference regarding my comparisons. 484 See chapter 5.4.1.1. and foot note 183. Though tar is not gas-tight, it still prevents most of the water and HCN to penetrate it."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"7. Z YKLON B FOR THE K ILLING OF H UMAN B EINGS 229 erage concentration profiles of the insulated wall model is constant, it is linearly decreasing in the non-insulated walls from the inside out. The maximum average values close to the inner, HCN-exposed surface are quite comparable to the respectiv e constant average concentrations in the insulated cases. I have emphasized the values of particular interest: In case of homicidal gassings in the morgues 1 of crematoria II and III (without Zyklon B introduction columns), the walls will reach a quasi-stationary concentration of 8% of their saturation concentration. In case of disin- festation chambers, the value given for 6 hours of exposure to a con- stant HCN concentration—corresponding to a round-the-clock opera- tion—leads to ca. 16% for the aver age value of the entire wall, and some 30% for the surface. The values under consideration here are percent values of the satu- ration concentration of a wall, i.e. , relative values. The cases of the disinfestation and homicidal ‘gas chamber’ are only correctly compa- rable when one considers the absolute hydrogen cyanide concentra- tions in the masonry. If, for example, one considers that, in particular, the interior walls of the disinfest ation chambers intended for personal effects were warm, dry walls, while the alleged homicidal ‘gas cham- bers’ in crematoria II and III were cool and very moist, then, with equal gassing concentrations, one must multiply the relative concentra- tions of the homicidal ‘gas chamber’ by the factor of the increased hy- drogen cyanide absorption capability of cool, moist walls. If one as- sumes the value of 8 determined in this regard on page 187, then the absolute average hydrogen cyanid e content of the homicidal ‘gas chamber’ would be a value lying around 64% of the saturation concen- tration of a warm, dry wall in a disinfestation chamber, i.e. , four times higher than the average hydrogen cyanide content of the disinfestation chamber wall (ca. 16%), and more than twice as high as its maximum content at the surface (ca. 30%).

As a result of the high moisture content of those underground morgues, one can see that even with such short gassing times, the walls of a homicidal ‘gas chamber’ accumulate a hydrogen cyanide content which would be quite comparable to that of a disinfestation chamber. Much less hydrogen cyanide in the quasi-stationary condition of the hypothetical homicidal ‘gas chambers ’ could only be expected, if one were to assume absurdly short, but technically unfeasible gassing times, the application of very little Zyklon B, or only very few gas- sings at all. 7.3.2.4. Excursus: Capacity of Protective Filters Filter devices to protect against hazardous and/or lethal gases and vapors are divided a) into types according to the kind of gas to be fil- tered and b) into classes according to their capacity. Filters of class 3 with a large capacity are stored externally, usually in a container to be carried at one’s side, since they are too heavy to be carried on the mask. They are connected to the m ask with a hose. Filters of class 2 are screwed into the mask and form th e majority of all used filter types. Filters of class 1 are plug-in filters. The service life of gas filters depends on: • Type and concentration of the harmful compound; • Air demand of the carrier, as a function of the intensity of work performed and the personal constitution;   485 Hauptverband der gewerbliche n Berufsgenossenschaften, Atemschutz-Merkblatt , Carl Heymanns Verlag, Cologne Oct. 1981.

Needless to say that the Deutsche Institut für Normung (DIN, German Institute for Standardiza tion) has determined the minimum values of break-through times of filters under standard testing condi- tions. These conditions are: • 20°C; • 70 % relative humidity of air; • 30 liters flow-through of air per minute.

Since the mask carrier is only exposed to small amounts of hydrogen cyanide during delousing activities (during distribution of the product and at the end of the gassing, the hydrogen cyanide con- centration is rather low), experience showed that it is possible to use the mask several hours. According to Schmidt, 422 relaxed humans inhale some 14 liters of air per minute. This can increase up to 50 to 60 liters per minute in case of heavy physical work, in extreme cases even up to 100 to 120 liters. If, according to Pressac and in agreement with the witness ac- counts, a concentration of 1 vol.% was used during the gassings, the inmates of the special commands (‘Sonderkommandos’), who carried away the corpses out of the ‘gas cham bers’ of the crematorium IV and V as well as out of the farmhouses I/II, which did not have a ventila- tion system, had to wear gas masks. Equipped with gas filters of class 2 and doing heavy physical work, they would have been exposed to a high concentration of toxic gas. Since hydrogen cyanide is particularly well absorbed through sweat-wet skin, this would certainly have led to signs of poisoning. The minimum break-through times of corresponding modern gas filters of class 2, type B (for hydrogen cyanide) lies at 25 min. for 0.5 vol.% at an air flow-through of 30 liters per min. In case of a suffi- ciently hard physical labor, this time will be quickly cut to half or a quarter. Therefore, a modern filter of class 2 can offer only several minutes of safety under the circumstances under consideration. Breath- ing would have been seriously hindered by these filters (max. 5.6 mbar pressure difference at 95 l per min. according to the current DIN), hence the working speed would have been slow and the demand for resting times and forced pauses due to gas poisonings would have been huge. Since they were especially designed for hydrogen cyanide, the filters of that time had a higher capacity, and consequently their dura- bility might have been correspondingly higher, which, in turn, in- creased their service time. Pressac writes 489 that a hydrogen cyanide concentration of 1 vol.% is not tolerable even with filter mask, and that an exposure time of up to one minute is granted only in emergency cases, and this without any heavy physical work!   489 J.-C.

Z YKLON B FOR THE K ILLING OF H UMAN B EINGS 233 Finally, a poisoning through the sweat-wet skin would have been avoidable under these circumstances only if the workers would have worked with protective garments in the ‘gas chamber’, which was not reported by any witness and which would have reduced the working performance even more. The accounts of some witnesses regarding the applied concentrations and the quick clearing of the chamber after the execution without protective garments and masks, on which even Pres- sac relies, exclude each other and thus can certainly not be correct. It should not be forgotten here that hydrogen cyanide is a contact poison. Transporting corpses, on whose skin huge, possible lethal amounts of hydrogen cyanide are absorbed, had required that the spe- cial commands dealing with these corpses had to wear protective clothes. Finally, when considering the applied concentrations attested to, the guards, like the special co mmands, would have risked their health. This is true for all ‘gas chambers’. 7.3.3. Evaluation of Eyewitnesses It is possible to provide a satisfactory answer to the problem of the Zyklon B introduction holes in the roofs of morgue 1 (the ‘gas cham- bers’) of crematoria II and III thr ough the interpretation of air photos and structural considerations. One must therefore conclude that the holes and cracks visible today were only put in during or after the de- struction of the building during the winter of 1944-45. This means that the poison gas could not have been introduced into the alleged ‘gas chambers’ in the manner described by the eyewitnesses. The rapidity of the executions as described by the eyewitnesses, in their extreme values (“ a few moments ”, “ a few minutes ”, “ two min- utes ”, etc.) cannot, once again, be attained with Zyklon B under the given technical conditions, and can onl y be attained through the use of very high quantities of Zyklon B. Entering the ‘gas chambers’ without protective measures, the per- formance of heavy physical work in the chambers, sometimes with a naked torso, while eating and smoking, along with testimony relating to large quantities of toxic gas, reveals the perjury of these eyewitnesses. 490 Equally false are the statements relating to the duration of ventila- tion of morgue 1 (the ‘gas chamber’) of crematoria II and III, since the   490 There are, of course, witnesses who allege that gas masks were worn.

In fact, safe entry into the ‘gas chamber’ without pr otective measures can hardly have been possible in less than three to four hours. Finally, heavy physical work could only have been conceivable before the expiration of at least another one and a half hours, even with gas masks. The eyewitness testimonies relating to the alleged cremation of the bodies, finally, are riddled with fantasy: cremation in deep ditches; cremation with liquid fuels; entirely without—or with ridiculously lit- tle—fuel; the destruction of corpses with explosives; the collection of human fat. These have nothing in common with technical reality or possibility, and are largely refuted by the Allied aerial photographic evidence: no huge ditches, no smoke, no fire, no fuel storage areas. The illogical and ridiculous— in Pressac’s words—gassing sce- narios in the ‘gas chambers’ of crematoria IV and V as well as the comparable ones in farmhouses I and II, would have been extremely dangerous for the Sonderkommandos (see chapter 5.4.2. and 5.4.3.). Yet these ‘gas chambers’ must have been planned and built as instru- ments of mass murder, 491 if mass gassings were already underway elsewhere in the camp during their pe riod of construction. All of this must compel people accustomed to thinking in terms of technology and the natural sciences to conclude that the Germans must have de- cided to choose absolutely the most expensive, laborious, most dan- gerous and difficult way possible in which to kill people en masse . It would have been logical, for propaganda purposes, to have de- scribed the installations such as th e disinfestation chambers intended for personal effects located in buildings 5a and 5b as homicidal ‘gas chambers’. But this was never attempted, nor are there any eyewitness testimonies as to such a utilization of these premises. Furthermore, the doors drawn in the plans of the disinfestation chambers of buildings 5b—as well as the doors located there today—open inwards, which would have rendered it impossible to remove bodies lying in front of the doors after the mass gassings. These rooms were, therefore, cer- tainly never used as homicidal ‘gas chambers’. It is nevertheless possi- ble that an attempt was made to represent the disinfestation chamber in   491 J.-C.

The water pipes visi- ble there hang freely in space inside the room, without any connection; only a few of them are equipped with shower heads, while they termi- nate in the ventilation openings in the exterior wall, i.e. , they were in- stalled after the removal of the di sinfestation devices (ovens, ventila- tors, and so on), very probably after the German withdrawal (see Fig. 20). Remarkably, all pipes and fittings have been removed from the real shower room in the same wing (see Fig. 17). In case this is not an attempted falsification, it is still possible that this wing was clumsily converted into a shower room after the end of the war, when Birkenau was used as prisoner camp for Germans. But this is not likely, since this building had proper showers already, so why dismantle them first, and then construct a makeshift shower in a room unsuitable for it? Brief mention should be made at this point of the widespread no- tion that the toxic gas streamed in to the alleged homicidal ‘gas cham- ber’ through shower heads, especia lly as there are even a few such eyewitness statements. Zyklon B consists of the active ingredient, hy- drogen cyanide, adsorbed on a solid carrier material (gypsum) and only released gradually. Since it was neither a liquid nor a gas under pres- sure, the hydrogen cyanide from this product could never have traveled through narrow water pipes and shower heads. Possible showers, or fake shower heads, could therefore only have been used to deceive the victims; they could never have been used for the introduction of this poison gas. There is general unanimity as to this point, no matter what else might be in dispute."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 236 Table 16: Evaluation of eyewitnesses E YEWITNESS C LAIM E VALUATION Death of all victims after 0 (instantane- ously) to 15 minutes. If high concentrations of hydrogen cyanide are used, as in American execution chambers, death occurs in a period of 10 minutes or even later. During the process, the victim is there- fore exposed to a high overdose concentration of hydrogen cyanide. Technically this is not possible with Zyklon B, since the Zyklon B carrier base releases the gas slowly (50% in 30 to 90 minutes, according to the temperature and relative hu- midity). The distribution of the gas throughout the chamber from a few sources of hydrogen cyanide only, and the absorp- tion of the gas by the moist walls and the nearby victims would further delay the process. Killing all the victims in a few (less than five) minutes w ould be impossible. Even during the use of very large quantities of Zyklon B (much more than 10g per m 3 ). Opening of the doors to the ‘gas chamber’ after the execution (and sometimes a short ventilation time) and immediate com- mencement of trans- port of the bodies without gas masks and protective cloth- ing. The ventilation system, if it existed, did not have the perform- ance to clear the chambers in the time frame attested to. As- suming that the victims died quickly from the high concentra- tions of toxic gas, then the workers in the Sonderkommando would also have been killed by the gas. Working without gas masks equi p ped with a filter is totally inconceivable; at high concentrations of poison gas, even these are very unsafe. Heavy respiratory devices must be worn at concentrations of over 0.5 Vol.%, which would re nder the removal of the bodies much more difficult. Contamination through the skin must be expected during heavy work, i nvolving perspiration, and due to the high concentrations of hydrogen cyanide on the skin of the victims. At the same time, such concentrations are suffi- cient to put a stop to the workers’ ability to work (dizziness, nausea, etc.). Protective clothing is therefore required. Blue vapor over the victims. Hydrogen cyanide is a colorless li quid and/or an invisible gas. The name “ Blausäure ” (blue acid) is due to the reaction of hydrogen cyanide with iron, forming the iron- b lue pigment. There cannot, therefore, have been any blue vapor. Bluish/greenish col- oration of the skin of the victims. Hydrogen cyanide blocks the oxygen supply to the cells. The b lood can no longer give off oxygen to the cells. Saturation of the blood with oxygen therefore o ccurs; the skin of the victim therefore has a reddish, not bluish, appearance, especially on the mucous membranes and during post-mortem lividity. On the other hand, if the victims had slowly suffocated, this could explain bluish coloration of skin. Attempted destruction of the bodies by means of explosives. Totally unsuited and dangerous.

The maintenance of fires in such pits was not possible. Cremation of the corpses with metha- nol and/or old oil. The complete cremation of corpses requires a high tempera- ture. Liquid fuels always burn only near and on the corpse, so that the heat is lost upwards; in addition, they trickle down into the subsoil in open air. Me thanol evaporates very easily and therefore has a very low flame temperature. Experiments with cremations in the open air show that corpses can be car- b onized on the outside, but not however entirely cremated with these fuels. Pouring escaping human fat over the bodies. This is an entirely absurd te stimony. If anything burns in the flesh at all, it is the fat.

Z YKLON B FOR THE K ILLING OF H UMAN B EINGS 241 7.3.5. Why Precisely Zyklon B? One might naturally wonder why the SS are supposed to have de- cided to use Zyklon B as an instrument of mass murder. The Soviets, at any rate, killed countless millions of human beings either simply by shooting them in the back of the neck or allowing them to die in camps under miserable conditions. Surely it would have been simpler to leave the people deported to Auschwitz to their fate; they would have per- ished from hunger and epidemics within a very short time anyway. That is how the Americans murdered approximately 1 million German civilian internees after the end of the Second World War. 494 Instead, the SS at Auschwitz spent almost one billion dollars, in today’s values, to bring the epidemics raging there under control, incurring huge ex- penditures on medical facilities, to cure the internees from the typhus epidemics, which were very often fatal. 495 This alone speaks volumes about the credibility of the conventional wisdom. The academic question, therefore, of whether or not some other poison gas would have been better suited for the mass murders instead of hydrogen cyanide in the form of Zyklon B cannot, in the last analy- sis, be answered, since there are no scientifically documented experi- mental values for mass murder by poison gas. Theoretically, one could, at that time, have chosen between nitro- gen (N 2 ), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), phosgene (COCl 2 ), chlorine (Cl 2 ), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), nerve gases such as Tabun and Sarin, Diesel engine exha ust, internal combustion engine exhaust, producer gas, coke or city gas, process gas, and, possibly, still other, entirely different, instruments of mass murder, suitable even un- der completely different circumstances (shooting in the back of the neck, hunger, epidemics). But if one really wished to take the trouble to commit mass killings with poison gas, it is most probable that one would have used carbon monoxide, which is definitely lethal to human   494 James Bacques, Other Losses , Stoddart, Toronto 1989; Bacque, Crimes and Mercies , Little, Brown & Co., Toronto 1996. 495 Hans Jürgen Nowak, op. cit.

The poison gas CO was available in limitless quantities and in le- thal concentrations at giveaway prices, substantially cheaper than Zyklon B, on almost every street corner in the Third Reich: a) Internal combustion engines easily attain a CO content of 7% by volume, so that it would have been suitable for mass murder. Nevertheless only a very small minority of eyewitnesses speak of the use of internal combustion engines in only one German concentration camp (Sobibor). 496 b) Producer gas generators generate a gaseous mixture with a pro- portion of CO of up to 35% by volume, using only wood or coke, air and water. These genera tors were installed in hundreds of thousands of vehicles all over German-occupied Europe dur- ing the Second World War, since it was necessary to convert to alternate fuels due to the Allied oil blockade. As F.P. Berg has shown, every member of the German Reich Government was familiar with these extraordinarily economical and easily oper- ated installations with their quick ly lethal toxic gas, especially the transport experts, whose duty it was to gradually replace all Diesel and internal combustion engines with generator gas in- stallations. These were, in some cases, exactly the same people who were entrusted with the de portation and allegedly with the killing of Jews—such as Adolf Eichmann, for example. 496 But it has never been claimed that th ese installations were used for purposes of homicide. c) Toxic city gas with a CO portion of up to 30% by volume was available in every major city for a ridiculously low price. Con- sideration would obviously have been given to committing mur- der with it. d) Process gas: The German corporate giant I.G. Farbenindustrie AG had already built a coal gasification/liquidification plant only a few kilometers away from Auschwitz concentration camp in the early 1940s. Here, by mean s of various conversion proc- esses, coal was converted into chemical end products, from which oils, fats, fuels, and synt hetic rubbers could be processed. The first step in this process is the generation of process gas,   496 See Friedrich P. Berg, “ The Diesel Gas Chambers: Ideal for Torture—Absurd for Murder ”, in: Ernst Gauss (ed.), op. cit.

If the SS had looked for a sim- pler way to kill millions of Jews, the center of extermination certainly would have been built in the vicinity of Monowitz, with a direct process gas pipeline from the I.G. Farbenindustrie AG factory. 2. It would not have been necessary to order and store CO and pay attention to the use-by date, as was necessary in the case of Zyk- lon B; carbon monoxide would have been available at all times, as soon as the economical installations were completed. 3. The handling of CO would have been considerably simpler for the executioners. Almost the only thing to pay attention to would have been the opening and closing of the CO valve. The handling of Zyklon B, on the other hand, woul d have demanded a remarkable number of safety precautions on the part of the executioners. The wearing of gas masks, and, when possible, additional protective clothing (gloves), the careful opening of the cans with a suitable tool, the careful introduction of the carrier through the openings, the careful disposal of the Zyklon B residues. 4. CO can be introduced simply and quickly through pressure pipes or through a blower, while Zyklon B, on the other hand, releases its toxic fumes only slowly. 5. In the case of CO, there would not have been so many problems with ventilating the air in the mass execution areas as with hydro- gen cyanide/Zyklon B, since the introduction of CO could be stopped simply by closing a valve, and because CO does not ad- here to surfaces and is almost insoluble in water—in extreme con- trast to hydrogen cyanide. 6. Zyklon B was scarce and expensive, and was needed everywhere to combat epidemics such as typhus, including in the army and German-allied armed forces, so that any avoidable squandering of it for other purposes would have been avoided—even, and espe- cially, at Auschwitz, where typhus threatened not only the lives of the inmates, but also the guards and civilians entering the camp or who lived in the vicinity.

The struggle against epidemics, for which Zyklon B was undoubtedly needed, was therefore of the greatest importance, in larger quantities than the manufacturer, DEGESCH, was able to deliver at that time. Naturally, CO would not necessarily speed up the execution pro- cedure in comparison to hydrogen cyanide, but it would have been safer, more easily available nearby, less complicated, and cheaper. 497 Certainly, “the bottleneck in the extermination process [...would have been] the incineration of the bodies, not the gassing itself.

Leuchter/Alpha Analytic Laboratories All of Leuchter’s positive findings from the alleged homicidal ‘gas chamber’ lie in the vicinity of the ‘official’ detection threshold (1 mg per kg) and must be expected to e xhibit very high fluctuations. Control sample no. 32 is from the disinfestation wing of Building 5a (which Leuchter calls “ disinfestation chamber 1 ”). The foundations of crema- toria IV and V are alleged to have been rebuilt from the rubble of other buildings (see chapter 5.4.2). Thus, the analyses of samples originating from these walls are nevertheless interesting, due to their positive find- ings in places. That the analytical values of samples from areas protected from environmental influences are just as low as results from exposed loca- tions, or not detectable at all, led Leuchter to the conclusion that the environmental influences could not have considerably reduced the cyanide content of the exposed buildings, 504 which would be in accor- dance with the findings in chapter 6.6. According to Leuchter, low cyanide traces may have resulted from an isolated fumigation of the morgues for pest control, since interior disinfestations were carried out in many camp buildings at that time. The positive result (1.3 mg per kg) of Sample 28, which Leuchter took from the partition of the former washroom to the dissecting room of crematorium I, a wall which never   503 Driving out the hydrogen cyanide by boiling the sample for one hour in aqueous HCl in a slightly reductive medium (SnCl 2 ), Driving out in the continuous stream of air, collection in the aqueous KOH collector.

This result, approximately as high as the rest of the samples (including those from the foundation walls of cremato- rium IV and V, built of unknown material) may largely be explained by three factors: 1. Cyanide traces of this minimal order of magnitude may be present anywhere, which is, however, improbable. 2. This air raid shelter, like all rooms in Auschwitz-Birkenau, was occasionally fumigated with Zyklon B for disinfes- tation purposes. 3. Analytical values in this order of mag- nitude (near the detectable threshold) are not reproducible and therefore can- not be interpreted due to the limited ef- ficiency of the method. They are equivalent to zero values. In view of the results to be discussed below, this reason appears the most probable. According to Bailer, the high cyanide content of the control samples taken by Leuchter in the disinfestation wing is to be attributed either to an artifact, an error in the sample taking, or an analytical error. He understands an artifact to mean that the wall of the disinfestation wing was painted with blue paint, precisely, an Iron Blue paint, at an earlier time. Bailer further expresses the opinion that no Iron Blue could form in the masonry material due to the alkaline envi- ronment. In addition, the high cyanide con- tent of 1,050 mg per kg is said to mean that the walls consist 0.1% of pigment, which in his opinion could not possibly be true. 505   505 J. Bailer, op. cit.

Institute for Forensic Research, Cracow The analytical values shown in Table 18 were never published by the Jan Sehn Institute. They only became public knowledge due to an act of indiscretion. The results appear to suggest that the alleged ‘gas chambers’ exhibit either no cyanide residues at all or values which are clearly lower than those found in samples taken from the disinfestation chambers. The scientist responsible, Prof. Markiewicz, writes about the chemistry involved: 56 “Hydrogen cyanide is a weak acid, which has the result that its salts decompose slightly in the presence of stronger acids. One of these stronger acids is carbonic acid, which arises from the reaction between carbon dioxide and water. [Even] stronger acids, such as, for example, sulfuric acid, decompose cyanide even more easily. Complex compounds with cyanide ions with heavy metals are more durable. Among such compounds is the already mentioned ‘Prussian Blue’ [=Iron Blue] , but even this decomposes slowly in an acid environment. One could hardly expect, therefore, that building materials (plaster, brick) exposed to environmental influ ences (precipitation, acid oxides, especially sulfuric and nitric monoxide) would contain derivative com- pounds of cyanides after a period of 45 years.” This contradicts the facts established above, and so to repeat: a) Carbon dioxide is only slightly soluble in water and hardly forms carbonic acid in water at all, and therefore the cyanide salts cannot “ decompose ” (see chapter 6.5.4.1. and note 349; actually, the wa- ter is responsible for the decomposition); b) Iron Blue (Prussian Blue) is extraordinarily stable in acids and is   506 Op. cit.

Bailer, 52,54 that the blue pigmentation of the disinfestation cham ber walls could be due to a coat of paint. To exclude this pigmentation from the analysis, they decided to apply a method which is insensitive to iron cyanides. An exchange of correspondence with myself in 1995 once again revealed the general incompetence with which the Polish researchers approached this set of problems. 58,59 A more detailed discussion of the Polish findings appears in chap- ter 8.4.2. 8.3.3. G. Rudolf/Fresenius Institute Only a few samples were taken from the alleged homicidal ‘gas chambers.’ Care was taken to ensure that samples were only taken from material not exposed to weathering. Only a few places in morgue 1 (the alleged ‘gas chamber’) in cr ematorium II at Birkenau, where a pillar supports the roof even today and has therefore visibly protected both the underside of the roof and parts of the wall from all influence of weathering, exemplified by the deposition of spider webs many years old and the absence of any trace of lime precipitation on the con- crete or mortar, which would be caused by rain water. Many samples have already been taken from the alleged ‘gas chambers’ by the Cracow team and Leuchter, all with at least nearly negative results. Since it was above all a matter of clarifying the ques- tion of which circumstances favor the formation of pigment and since clearly positive findings were not to be expected according to the analyses performed in the alleged ‘g as chambers’ thus far, the sample gathering took place chiefly in the disinfestation chambers of Build- ings 5a and 5b in construction secti on Ia and/or Ib. It is known that their walls not only contain large quantities of pigment, but that their age also corresponds approximately to that of the crematoria on the same location, which cannot be said of the buildings in the main camp. The age can, but need not, have an infl uence on the chemistry of the wall"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"8. E VALUATION OF C HEMICAL A NALYSES 253 materials. Furthermore, these buildings are not so much in the spotlight of the museum activity as those in the main camp, and therefore rather permit hope of an absence of s ubsequent building alterations. Finally, samples were taken from a few inmate barracks to exam- ine Leuchter’s argument that low cyanide traces could also result from a few fumigations for pest control. The numbering of the barracks cor- responds to those found on the barracks today. 509 See also, in this re- gard, Fig. 12. 8.3.3.1. Samples 1-4: Crematorium II, Morgue 1 On the taking of samples 1 to 3, see Figure 26 (page 92). An ex- tremely high concentration of cyanide on the surface of the material must generally be expected. To investigate this, sample 1 contains, principally, concrete prongs from the ceiling/underside of the roof (caused by wooden planking), that is, the most exposed part of the concrete, as well as material from the uppermost layer of concrete, 1 to 2 cm thick, including a piece up to a depth of approximately 3 mm. Sample 2 contains concrete to a depth of 5 mm, taken from the place at which the piece extending inward up to a depth of 3 mm was obtained in sample 1. Separation between material from the topmost layer (Sample 1) and lower layers (Sample 2) was not entirely possible due to the ex- treme hardness of the concrete. Sample 3 is a harder plaster, obviously rich in cement, extending to the first row of bricks. Sample 4 originates from the plaster of the concrete beam in the chimney wing (rubbish incineration) of crematorium II. It is only inter- esting as a blind sample in addition to the others. The results lie in the same order of magnitude as Leuchter’s posi- tive findings from other alleged ‘gas chambers’, although Leuchter had no positive results in samples from morgue 1 (‘gas chamber’) of cre- matorium II. The difference between Samples 1 and 2 may indicate that a depth profile is actually prevalent in the concrete. Table 20 shows a list of control analyses. Sample 3 mentioned above with a low positive result of 6.7 mg/kg now has a value below the detectable threshold (0.5 mg per kg). This confirms the statement made in chapter 8.2. that values near the detectable threshold are not reproducible.   509 J.-C. Pressac, op. cit.

Sample 14 is a loose fragment of brick which is clearly dark blue at all points facing outwards and therefore exposed to weathering. Sample 15a is mortar from the south wall, only the topmost layer of which was blue to a depth of approximately 1 mm. The cyanide value at this point must have been above the average value of the first approximately 3 mm. Sample 15b is a fragment of brick, the blue layer of which was sepa- rated with a spatula (Sample 15c). The mass of the remaining fragment amounted to approximately twenty times the layer scratched off; only slight cyanide concentrations are de tectable here. The average concen- tration here must have been around 120 mg/kg. On the brick as well, the pigment has only formed in perceptible quantities on the outermost side, that which is exposed to weathering (in this regard, see the exte- rior wall of the disinfestation chamber in Stutthof concentration camp, Fig. 65). Very important is the confirmation of the fact that the pigment ac- tually possesses an enormous environmental resistance, since Samples 14 to 15c were exposed to intensive sunshine, wind, rain, etc. for more Fig. 68: The outside of the external wall of hydrogen cyanide delousing wing of building 5a in August 1991.

But how did the pigment arise in such high concentra- tions at this precise location, although the outside of the exterior walls were not exposed to any direct fu migation? The low quantities of cya- nide which diffused through the masonry are apparently sufficient to enable the formation of pigment on the outside of the wall, which was moist, especially during rainy weat her, and its iron compounds were certainly massively activated by environmental influences. The inside of the exterior walls of the disinfestation wing of Build- ing 5a are almost completely blue, even dark blue (see Fig. 69, below). Interestingly, the pattern of the br ick structure located below the plas- ter has made an imprint on the intensity of Iron Blue formation in the upper layer of the plaster. Such a phenomenon is similar to, e.g. , the well known condensation of excessive atmospheric humidity on cool walls (for example, in large groups of sweating human beings, such as at rock concerts, in discotheques, or, generally, in poorly heated rooms), which also leads to the formation of patterns exhibiting the Fig. 69: Picture of a room located in the northwest of the disinfestation wing of building 5a (see Figure 18). The ex terior walls are located in the background and to the right, showing intensive blue discolorations caused by iron Blue. Taking locations of samples 9 and 11 are visible.

Differently-baked bricks have a different tendency towards accu mulation through condensation due to their differing heat conductivity. Differing reactivity to the forma- tion of cyanides due to differing moisture contents and temperatures may therefore be the cause of this effect, but also differing transport capacities for migrating cyanide salts due to differing moisture con- tents. Underneath the first layer of wall plaster, only approximately 1 mm thick, the material appears, by contrast, pale blue, just like the en- tire east wall of the wing, which is an interior wall of the original disin- festation chamber and whose discoloration is much less intensive (samples 12 and 13). The interior walls of the same room, which were incorporated at a later time, i.e. , those belonging to the hot air disinfestation chamber (see Fig. 18), exhibit, as expected, no trace of blue. The results of samples 9 and 11, and 20 and 22, resp., confirm the first impression. The topmost layer of plaster on the inside of the exte- rior walls has a very high cyanide concentration; underneath, the con- centration decreases. The high cyanide concentration of Sample 11 could not, however, be exactly reproduced. The results of the control analysis lies at only 54% of the first value.

In pure Iron Blue, 1 g of cyanide contains approximately 0.82 g iron. The iron analysis, assuming that the cyanide is present completely in the form of Iron Blue, shows that, in Sample 9, approximately ¾ of all iron was converted to pigment. If one considers that not all iron can be reached by the hydrogen cyanide, then one can speak of a near- saturation of the upper layer of material with the pigment. The drop in the concentration from the topmost layer to the lower layers is ex- plained, for one thing, by the linear gradient which must be expected in not isolated walls (see chapter 7.3.2.3.). Furthermore, as with the blue pigmentation of the exterior of the walls, the effect of accumulation of cyanides on the surface through evaporation of water carrying soluble cyanide compounds must be considered, even though this effect was certainly smaller on inside walls than on outside walls due to lack of air exchange in these rooms after the war (high relative humidity of the air, no wind), and due to the lack of sun activity in the room equipped with windows facing northwards only, see in Fig. 69. Samples 12 and 13 correspond to Samples 9 and 11, taken from the interior wall only, from the east wall, near one of the hot air cham- bers. The surface concentration is c onsiderably lower than on the in- Fig. 71: In contrast to building 5a (see Fi g. 68), the disinfestation wing of building 5b was used as a hydrogen cyanide delousing chamber for a longer period of time.

E VALUATION OF C HEMICAL A NALYSES 263 side of the exterior walls, there is no recognizable concentration pro- file. The reason for this may be that the dry walls allow the hydrogen cyanide to diffuse more easily into the masonry, while the hydrogen cyanide more readily reacts superficially on the moist exterior walls. It is more probable, however, that no migration of soluble cyanide salts to the surface took place in the interior wall due to dryness. These samples are also interesting insofar as they prove that high quantities of cyanide compounds, highly-resistant for long periods of time, can form on warm and dry interior walls. Due to the high ground water table in Birkenau, as well as due to the lack of an effective heat insula- tion, the exterior walls must be exp ected to have been quite cool and moist even when the interior was heated, particularly during the cool seasons. The samples from the walls added during the conversion to hot air disinfestation should exhibit no cyanide residues. Accordingly, sample no. 10 from the interior wall incorporated at a later time exhibits only a very low cyanide concentration near the detectable threshold. Sample 21 was taken from the mortar between the bricks of the wall installed later, at a depth of 1 cm to 5 cm into the masonry. There is a crack in the masonry of the interior wall at this location. The analysis shows minimal but hardly interpretable traces of cyanide below the detectable threshold in this interior wall as well. This finding may indicate disin- festation of these rooms after the conversion to hot disinfestation, if the slight quantities have not in any case lost all probative value, like the control analysis of the other samples have shown. Sample 18, finally, was taken from the door frame which was only incorporated after the conversion to hot air disinfestation. Below the lower hinge, the wood exhibits a visibly blue pigmentation (see Fig. 70, p. 261). The pigment was able to form here due to the moisture in the floor, in connection with the rusting iron. This is assuming that the rooms were either charged with hy drogen cyanide after the conversion of the installation or that the floor of the installation continued to give off cyanide over longer periods of tim e. In the first case, the cyanide traces in the walls added later (Samples 10 and 21) could actually be explained by fumigation of the room s. However, during the conversion of this wing to a hot air disinfestation facility, this gas-tight door may have been removed from the access way to this wing and re-used here, so that the cyanide would result from earlier fumigations. The analyti- cal results should only be conditionally considered as qualitative, since"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 264 organic material can be a disturbing factor during analysis. In any case, the high reactivity of moist iron oxide mixtures (rust) is confirmed. Building 5b: The exterior walls of disinfestation wing BW 5b are not only blue in places, as in the case of BW 5a, but rather, almost completely so, even below the gr ound (see Fig. 71, below). An excep- tion here is the east wall, which hard ly exhibits any blue pigmentation (see Fig. 19, p. 76). The analysis of a fragment of brick from the south side (Sample 16) therefore shows an extremely high value. Here, the pigment extends further into the m asonry. Here as well, weathering has had no visible or measurable effect on the pigment concentration. Ap- proximately 17% of the iron in the fragment of brick has been trans- formed into pigment, despite the onl y slight concentration in cyanides able to reach the exterior of the masonry wall here as well. The con- spicuous difference between Buildi ng BW 5b and 5a, which is only blue in places, is explained by the longer period of use of the 5b wing as a Zyklon B disinfestation chamber. The reason for the perceptibly lesser blue pigmentation of the east side of the exterior wall of this wing can be explained by the lesser influence of weathering on this side (east winds are mostly accompanied by dry weather in eastern Europe). When examining the interior of this wing, one is surprised by the walls which are mostly white. Pale green stains are visible only in a few places. The analysis of the green-colored plaster underneath the upper layer, Sample 17, however, shows the highest value found any- where, despite the thick layer of plaster consisting of a compact, very hard material, 3 to 4 mm thick. With relation to the transformation of the iron, what was said of the upper layer of plaster in BW 5a only, is true here: near saturation. The color of the material, here only greenish, is apparently not directly meaningful with regards to the cyanide con- centration. Because even in the pr esence of maximum values, the pro- portion of pigment in the plaster only amounts to 1.5 %, the intense blue color in places on the surface of the inside of exterior walls of BW 5a cannot moreover be explained in th is manner. Rather, the dark blue colors result from a still higher concentration of pigment in the upper- most layers in the micro-meter range of magnitude caused by the ac- cumulation processes of migrating, so luble cyanide salts as described above. That these accumulation processes did not occur on the surface of the inside of Building 5b may be expl ained by the different type of ma-"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"8. E VALUATION OF C HEMICAL A NALYSES 265 terial and its preparation. The hard, iron-poor interior plaster of lime mortar adheres very poorly to the wall and is already falling off in some places. The contact between plaster and wall is so poor in places, that when one knocks on the wall, one hears that there is a hollow space beneath. Such weak contact between wall and plaster, however, prevents moisture in the wall from diffusing through to the surface plaster and carrying soluble cyanide compounds (for example, iron(II)- cyanide) with it. Sample 19 was divided in two, since the upper layer of plaster in this room is visibly different from the layer lying beneath: The first 4 mm of plaster consists of a white, brittle, hard material (sand-poor lime plaster), while the layer underneath c onsists of an ochre-colored, sand- rich lime plaster. The separation was not completely successful; parts of the sand-rich mortar remain in Sample 19a. The analysis for iron, which might possibly have been ev en lower in the presence of com- plete separation, confirms the assumption that the upper layer is an iron-poor lime plaster. This explains the deficient formation of blue spots of pigment on the surface of the plaster in this room, since there is too little iron available for the formation of pigment. Nevertheless, even the upper layer of plaster exhibits quite high cyanide values. This shows that the layer of plaster was not applied after termination of the disinfestation actions. 8.3.3.4. Samples 25-30: Tests For an evaluation of the reactivity of hydrogen cyanide with build- ing materials, a series of tests was undertaken; during the first series, only brick was fumigated with hy drogen cyanide, generated from a defined quantity of KCN+H 2 SO 4 in a gas-tight container. Over the course of the tests, it became apparent by means of sensitive differen- tial pressure measurements that only a part of the hydrogen cyanide added to 16% sulfuric acid was released as gas. Hydrogen cyanide is so easily soluble, even in this acid, that only a portion of it is actually released into the gas room. The actua l quantity of gas in the reaction container therefore lay far below the mathematically calculated 3.7% by volume, while the pressure measurements consequently lay around 2 % by volume.

Storage of the samples for more than two months at room temperature therefore perceptibly reduced the hydro- gen cyanide content, while the drying of the samples strongly hindered the conversion to iron cyanide. The analytical results relating to the brick samples (Table 19, p. 254, Sample no. 25 and 26) are surprising for their values, which ap- pear paradoxical: the fumigated sample, in contrast to the unfumigated sample, exhibited no traces of cyanide. The value of the unfumigated sample could be exactly reproduced (Table 20). Further analyses of the fumigated brick likewise resulted in no demonstrable cyanide concen- trations. These findings prove that cyanide values up to 10 mg per kg have only very limited probative value, since these can be attributed to traces which occur everywhere. 510 The interpretation of the analytical results of samples 27 to 30 re- sulted in the following data: • In total, 30 mg of cyanide were found in the samples during the analysis. Since 300 mg cyanide were used during this test, 10% of   510 It is also conceivable that the unfumigated samples were contaminated during preparation for analysis, perhaps through an improperly cleaned ball mill, in which samples with a high cya- nide content had previously been crushed. The reason for the good reproducibility may be that there is hardly any carbonate in brick, since it acts as a disturbance ion. Table 21: Test sample preparation and fumigation Nr.

The higher iron content of the cement mortar samples may be the reason for this, since the cyanide content increases proportionally to the iron content (see the last column of Table 19). In addition, hydrogen cyanide adsorption was certainly favored by the higher inner surface area of the cement mortar as compared to lime mortar. • The increased hydrogen cyanide ab sorption caused by the addition of moisture was only slightly perceptible in the analytical results, since the samples were all very moist anyway, and because the ma- terial dried out during the final storage phase and therefore the hy- drogen cyanide was only able to bind partially. • Blue pigmentation of the samples was not to be expected, since even if all the bound cyanide were present in the form of Iron Blue, only 0.005-0.01% of the total material w ould consist of the blue pigment, which would cause hardly any perceptible coloration to the naked eye. An accumulation of cyanides on the surface of the sample, fi- nally, could not occur due to the absence of water in diffusion. In addition, the dry storage of the samples probably blocked the con- version process. 8.3.4. John C. Ball All samples taken from alleged homicidal ‘gas chambers’ are around or well under the detection threshold and must therefore be considered zero.

E VALUATION OF C HEMICAL A NALYSES 269 8.4. Discussion of the Analysis Results 8.4.1. Blue Wall Paint? The hypothesis expressed by J. Bailer, 52,54 that blue paint could be responsible for the high cyanide values in the disinfestation chambers, does not correspond to the facts: 1. Iron Blue is not sold as wall paint at all, since it lacks suffi- ciently high lime fastness (see chapter 6.6.1.). 2. If this argument were correct, it would be remarkable that the SS, of all the rooms in the Third Reich, would apply blue paint only to their disinfestation chambers where no one could admire it; and, strangely, always the same blue. All other rooms were whitewashed. Were the SS practitioners of ‘blue magic’? 3. The disinfestation chambers themselves already had a coat of lime paint. Why would they cover this coat of lime paint with another paint which, in addition, is not even lime fast? They would therefore have had to wait until the lime pain t and plaster had set before one could paint the walls. And then it w ould have been by no means certain that the paint would not furthermore have become stained as a result of chemical reactions. 4. A coat of paint on the interior of the room would not explain the patchy pattern of the blue stains on th e interior of the exterior walls of the disinfestation wing of Building 5a. 5. Neither would a coat of paint on the interior of the room explain the absence of blue coloration on the interior walls added to the disin- festation wing at a later time. Or are the SS supposed to have painted only certain walls, and then, not evenly, with paint brushes, but, per- haps, soiling the wall statistically by throwing and spattering? 6. Bailer’s argument is refuted by the fact that none of the colored walls shows any pattern of brush ma rks, and no identifiable coat of paint, since wall paint consists not only of pigment, but also of a not inconsiderable proportion of binding agents and other chemicals. The blue pigment is, however, simply one component of the lime paint and plaster. 7. Bailer’s argument furthermore fails to explain how the artistic skills of the painters could have succeeded in imitating the brick struc- ture lying beneath the plaster. Or did they not only practice ‘blue magic,’ but were equipped with X-ray eyes as well?"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 270 8. Bailer’s argument does not explain the only pale blue tint of the interior south walls of the original disinfestation wing of Building 5a. 9. Neither does Bailer’s argument explain the high cyanide con- centration in the superficially white, iron-poor material of the walls of the disinfestation wing of Building 5b. Or is it his opinion that these rooms were, perhaps, painted with an ‘iron white,’ a paint color that does not even exist? 10. Bailer’s argument furthermore fails to explain the still higher cyanide concentration of deeper, green ish-bluish coats of material in the walls of the disinfestation wing of Building 5b; or does he perhaps intend to argue that the SS even applied iron-blue paint to wall plaster and wall mortar where no one could ever admire it? There, it would in addition have certainly have been d ecomposed into its component parts due to the alkaline pH value of fresh mortar and would have lost its color at least temporarily. 11. Finally, Bailer’s argument cannot explain why even the exte- rior walls of the disinfestation rooms, exposed to weathering, have a notable cyanide content and are discolored with blue stains. Or did the SS employ the technique of statistically throwing and splashing paint about here as well, paying particular attention to the structure of the brick, resisting at all times the temptation to apply the coats of paint which are so typical of ordinary painting, simply because blotchy blue- stained brick is so sexy? Or was the Iron Blue applied to the bricks upon manufacture, resisting the baking process of the brick in a magi- cal fashion known only to the blue-magic SS? The Polish scientists, as indicated above, adopted Bailer’s argu- ment and therefore preferred simply not to prove the presence of Iron Blue at all. Honni soit qui mal y pense...

False Method of Analysis Many people, both experts and laymen, rely good-naturedly upon the findings of the Jan Sehn Institute for Forensic Research in Cracow, i.e. , the study published in 1994 by Prof. Markiewicz and colleagues. These Polish scientists, however, tested their samples with analytical methods that were unable to detect stable iron cyanide compounds. They did this because they could not imagine how such stable iron cyanide compounds could form. It is, of course, no shame to fail to"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"8. E VALUATION OF C HEMICAL A NALYSES 271 understand something initially. Anyone, however, who makes a claim to scientific reliability must, before making statements upon the sub- ject, at least attempt to investigate and understand. But not so the Pol- ish scientists. They assert their lack of understanding as a justification for their failure to act. Has anyone ever heard that failure to understand a phenomenon was any reason for scientists not to study it? To the Pol- ish scientists, this was obviously the case. It would only be permissible to exclude Iron Blue from the study if it were possible to exclude, with practical certainty, that the effects of hydrogen cyanide on masonry could result in the formation of iron cyanide, and, consequently, Iron Blue, and if there were at least some indication that these rooms had been painted with Iron Blue. The Polish scientists completely ne- glected to do this. And even worse: they did not even attempt to refute my arguments on the formation of stable iron cyanide compounds which I published in early 1993. 512 They were familiar with this publi- cation, because they quoted it, but not, for example, in order to discuss my arguments, but simply to condemn it flatly as an example of the allegedly diabolical deeds of the ‘d eniers’ and the ‘whitewashers’ of Hitler, who Prof. Markiewicz and hi s colleagues intended to refute—so their own words. This should suffice to show that the Polish actions were ideologically motivated, to a high degree. If they had been neutral scientists, they would have applie d the correct and interpretable method of analysis and would have discussed my publications in a scholarly manner instead of worrying about Hitler’s dirty laundry. Prof. Markiewicz and his colleagues did not even attempt to find any explanation for the high iron cyanide concentration in the walls of the disinfestation chambers and their blotchy-blue surfaces. Although they had sought out an analytical method able to pro- duce the results desired by them, the r esults of their first series of tests were obviously so disturbing that they decided to suppress them and never published them. These data only became public knowledge through an act of indiscretion in 1991 (see chapter 8.3.2.). 513 The Polish scientists therefore rejected the undesired results of   512 E. Gauss, Vorlesungen... , op. cit. (note 43), pp. 163-170; 290-294. 513 The first series of studies, undertaken by J. Markiewicz, W. Gubala, J. Labedz, and B. Trzcin- ska, were never published by the authors of th e studies. Only the revisionists have published their findings, after the article was smuggled out of the Jan Sehn Institute by unknown persons in 1991; see also note 56; for further remarks on this example of ‘politi cal science’, see G.

Table 24 shows the analysis results of Prof. Markiewicz and his colleagues compared to those of Fred Leuchter, John C. Ball, and mine. I will spare myself further analysis since analysis results obtained in a methodically incorrect manner cannot be corrected even by correct interpretation. Any attempt at interpretation is therefore a waste of time. 514 Even a direct comparison with my arguments and the open expres- sion of suspected fraud could not move Prof. Markiewicz and his col- leagues to justify or correct their unscientific manner of behavior. 58,59 The director of this group, Dr. Jan Markiewicz, who is not a chemist, but rather, a “ Technical Testing Specialist”, died in 1997. Both the other authors have remained silent. One can after all understand that these Polish authors made their careers in Communist Poland, and, as Polish patriots, can under no circumstances permit the undermining of ‘Auschwitz’ as a moral justi- fication for the Polish ethnic cleansing of the East Prussians, East Pomeranians, and Silesians after the end of World War Two, as a result   514 A word on the HCN-CO 2 mixture used by the Poles for their fumigation experiments.

Many Poles fear in their hearts that the post-war state of Poland stands and falls with Auschwitz. This may explain Prof. Markiewicz’s and his colleagues’ scientific contortions, but it fails to be a justification for them. Even the possible circumstance that the scientists assigned to the topic were not and are not chemists and that their laboratory was perhaps not equipped up to Western standards, cannot explain this, since an analy- sis of the total cyanide concentration is not expensive in terms of labo- ratory equipment and the chemistry involved is anything but compli- cated. The manner with which the Polish scientists approached the prob- lem, however, gives rise to serious suspicion that this was an attempt at scientific fraud, a suspicion which is also supported by the fact that they were unable to justify their incorrect methods of measurement except through their incompetence and ignorance. The conclusions to be drawn from the above is clear: the only ‘scientific’ attempt to refute Fredrick A. Leuchter’s sensational argu- ment proves, upon closer examination, to be one of the greatest scien- tific falsifications of the 20 th century. How desperate must one really be, if it is believed necessary to stoop to such methods in an attemp t to defend the established version of the Holocaust, i.e. , the alleged systematic extermination of the Jews in homicidal ‘gas chambers’? 8.4.3. The Memory Hole At the end of chapter 6.6.5., I already referred to the bold lies of Albert Meinecke from the German pr ess agency dpa regarding the al- leged short life term of hydrogen cyanide in masonry. A new corny joke was recently added to this debate by Prof. James Roth from the Alpha Analytic Laboratories, Ashland, Massachusetts. I discuss this event here because Prof. Roth’s allegations were widely publicized by the international media in connection with the libel case of British his- torian David Irving against Deborah E. Lipstadt. 515 For his documentary movie Mr. Death on Fredrick A. Leuchter, Errol Morris also interviewed Prof. Dr. James Roth. In 1988, Roth’s   515 This claim played a role in the verdict which should not be underestimated, cf. judgment Gray, op. cit.

During the trial against Ernst Zündel in Toronto that same year, for which the Leuchter report had been produced, Prof. Dr. Roth himself was interrogated as an expert witness. Ten years later, Errol Morris interviewed Roth about this event. During this interview, Prof. Roth did all he possibly could to distance himself from the possible conse- quences of the analyses performed by his company. His interview gained importance only due to the fact that the Dutch architectural His- torian Prof. Robert van Pelt quoted Roth in his 1999 expert report pre- pared for the Irving trial. In it, van Pelt wrote about Roth’s statements in Morris’ movie: 516 “Roth explained that cyanide will react on the surface of brick or plaster, penetrating the material not more than 10 microns, or 0.01 mm, or one tenth the thickness of a human hair [...] . In other words, if one wants to analyze the cyanide concentration in a brick sample, one should take a representative sample of the surface, 10 microns thick, and no more.” It can be shown that Prof. Dr. James Roth is wrong for the follow- ing reasons: 1. It is a fact that the walls of the disinfestation chambers in Ausch- witz, Birkenau, Stutthof, and Majd anek are saturated with cyanide compounds, and this not only superfi cially, but into the depth of the masonry, as I have proved by taking samples from different depths of the wall, compare in this regard especially my samples no. 11, 13, 17, 19b, and 23 in Table 19. They prove that hydrogen cyanide can rather easily reach deep layers of plaster and mortar. But even the other samples taken from the surface prove that Prof. Roth’s allegation is wrong: Provided that most of the cyanide de- tectable today is present in the form of iron cyanide (Iron Blue and other cyanoferrates), as Prof. Roth assumes himself, his thesis would mean that 10% to 75% of the iron content of these samples are located in the upper 10 micrometer of my samples (0.010 mm), i.e. , they are located in less then 1% of the entire sample mass, and the rest of the sample would have been massively deprived of iron. How this migration of a major portion of iron to a thin surface layer would have happened is inexplicable to me.   516 Pelt Report , op. cit. (note 66), p. 307."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"8.

Furthermore, expert litera ture is detailed in that a. hydrogen cyanide is a extremely mobile chemical compound with physical properties comparable to water, 322 b. which can quite easily penetr ate through thick, porous layers like walls. 409 3. In addition, it is generally known that cement and lime mortar are highly porous materials, comparable for instance with sponges. 517 In such materials, there does not exist something like a defined layer of 0.01 mm beyond which hydrogen cyanide could not dif- fuse, as there can also be no reason, why water could not penetrate a sponge deeper than a m illimeter. Steam, for example, which be- haves physically comparable to hydrogen cyanide, can very easily penetrate walls. 4. Finally, the massive discolorations of the outside walls of the dis- infestation chambers in Birkenau and Stutthof, as shown in this expert report, are clearly visible and conclusive evidence for the fact how easily hydrogen cyanide and its soluble derivatives can penetrate such walls. As a professor of analytical chemistry, Prof. Roth must know this, so one can only wonder why he spreads such outrageous nonsense. That Prof. Roth is indeed a comp etent chemist can be seen from what he said during his testimony under oath as an expert witness during the above mentioned Zündel trial: 518 “In porous materials such as brick or mortar, the Prussian blue [recte: hydrogen cyanide] could go fairly deep as long as the surface stayed open, but as the Prussian blue formed, it was possible that it would seal the porous material and stop the penetration.”   517 DIN 4108, part 3 to 5, deals with diffusion of steam into building materials. The most impor- tant coefficient for building materials is the so- called coefficient of diffusion resistance; this is a dimensionless number indicating, how much l onger the diffusion of steam takes to penetrate a layer of certain materials compared to the tim e it takes to diffuse through the same layer of still air. This coefficient is valid not only fo r water vapor, but also for gaseous hydrogen cya- nide as well as for any other gas. In the lis t of 100 different building materials compiled in DIN 4108 part 4, one can find lime and cement mortar with diffusion resistances from 15 to 35, in which case the resistance grows with incr easing cement content, for gypsum plaster, the coefficient is 10, for brick walls 5 to 10, for gla ss wool mats it is 1. That means, if a gas dif- fuses through a layer of still air with a speed of 1 cm per second, it does take 15 to 35 seconds to diffuse through a 1 cm thick layer of lime or cement mortar and 5 to 10 seconds to diffuse just as deep into a brick wall.

That would explain why the truth temporarily dropped into a hole in Prof. Roth’s memory while being interview by Errol Morris. It is also revealing that Prof. Roth mentioned during this interview, if he had known where Leuchter’s samples originated from, his analytical results would have been differ- ent. Does that mean that Prof. Ro th manipulates his result according to whether or not he likes the origin of certain samples? Such an attitude is exactly the reason why one shoul d never tell an ‘independent’ labo- ratory about the origin of the sam ples to be analyzed, simply because ‘independence’ is a very flexible te rm when it comes to controversial topics. What Prof. Dr. Roth has demonstrated here is only his lack of professional honesty. 8.4.4. The Moon is Made of Pizza Another strange story is that of Richard Green, a PhD Chemist with quite similar educational background as I have. 63-65 The layman would expect two experts, with similar educational background, to come to similar conclusions in qu estions relating to their expert knowledge. But this is only partly the case. The reason for this is that Dr. Green ignores many facts that are either supported by documentary evidence—like the performance of the ventilation installed in cremato- ria II and III, or the speed of execu tions in U.S. execution chambers— or by expert literature—like the highe r tendency of cold, moist walls to adsorb HCN, and the longer lasting alkalinity of cement mortar com- pared to lime mortar. However, Dr. Green makes some concessions which are important to note: a) He agrees that basically all w itnesses attest to very short execu- tion times, indicating a rather high concentration of HCN used. b) He also agrees “that Rudolf is correct or nearly correct regard- ing the formation of blue staining in the delousing chambers.” What he does challenge, though, is the possibility of formation of any noticeable quantities of Iron Blue in the homicidal ‘gas chambers.’ One of his flawed and deficient arguments to support his thesis is that in his view, no noticeable amounts of cyanide could have accumulated in the walls of the morgues (‘gas ch ambers’). According to Dr. Green,"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"8. E VALUATION OF C HEMICAL A NALYSES 277 one major factor for this is supposed to be the fact that masonry has a neutral pH value which does not allow the protolysis of hydrogen cya- nide and thus the formation of cyanid e salts. But if that were true, how come huge amounts of cyanides did accumulate in the walls of the dis- infestation chambers? My argument in this regard is that particularly cement plasters and concretes, as used in morgues 1 of crematoria II and III, are noticeably alkaline for many weeks, months, or even years, which I documented thoroughly with expert literature on th e chemistry of building materials (see chapter 6.7.2.). Hence, I concluded that these walls would have been very much inclined to accumula te cyanide salts and to form Iron Blue, even more so than the lime plaster of the disinfestation cham- bers, which in turn provoked the following answer by Dr. Green: “ [In 1993] The IFRC [Institute for Forensic Research, Cracow] , on the other hand measured the pH [of mortar samples from the alleged gas chambers] to be between 6 and 7 [i.e. neutral] .” Dr. Green obviously did not consult any literature on the chemis- try of building materials, as he quotes none. He solely relies on the findings of the Cracow institute. In order to make the reader see how flawed Dr. Green’s way of arguing is, let me say it in a parable: By referring to a couple of Italia n expert pizza baking instructions, I showed that a pizza, when taken out of the oven, is hot or warm for quite a while (one hour). Now, Dr. Green comes along claiming that I am wrong because a Polish friend of his has just now measured the temperature of a pizza which was baked a week ago, and which has been lying around somewhere since. And the Polish scientists found out that this pizza is indeed cold right now. Surprise, surprise! Of course, samples taken from the surface of walls erected 50 years ago or more are now pH neut ral! Even this I have proved by showing how the front of neutraliza tion slowly migrates into concrete and mortar (see chapter 6.7.2.2.). But what does the pH value of sam- ples taken 50 years after the erection of these building prove regarding their pH value shortly after they were built? Dr. Green’s way of argu- ing is childish to the highest degree. When it comes to intellectual hon esty, Dr. Green reveals some other very strange behavioral pattern s, one of which I want to address here. Dr. Green agrees with me that the Iron Blue found in delousing"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 278 chambers is the result of gassings with hydrogen cyanide. Hence he disagrees with the opinion of Markiewicz and others that this Iron Blue has its origin for different reasons , like residual paint. Consequently, Dr. Green should refuse the approach of the Cracow team to exclude Iron Blue from the analysis, because this would most likely exclude the major parts of the cyanide residues formed by gassings with HCN in general (not just in case of delousing chambers). Subsequently, Dr. Green should furthermore criticize Markiewicz for having chosen a method of analysis which must lead to faulty and misleading result, as I did. Additionally and more genera lly, he should say that the Polish scientists neither tried to understand what they claimed not to have un- derstood, nor discussed the attempts to understand as made by others, which were known to them. No matter which results the Polish scien- tists produced and what their scientific opinion might have been: their behavior is extremely unscientific, as the most important task of a scientist is to try to understand what has not been understood so far, and to discuss the attempts of others to make understandable . The Polish scientists did just the opposite: they decided to ignore and exclude what they did not understand. Finally, in their article as well as in a letter to me, the Polish scientists themselves stated that the purpose of their paper was to refute the “ Holocaust Deniers ” and to prevent Hitler and National Socialism from being whitewashed, i.e. , their pur- pose was not to find out the truth! Thus, by their own confession, they used unscientific methods in order to produce desired results for the purpose of achieving certain political goals. Let me quote Prof. A.R. Butz in this connection, who stated an- other appropriate metaphor to emphasize the degree of intellectual dis- honesty revealed by Markiewicz and his colleagues: 519 “The argument [of Markiewicz et al. for excluding Iron Blue from their analyses] , to the extent that it was in telligible enough to be summa- rized at all, was that they did not understand how the iron-cyanide com- pounds got to be there, so they decided to ignore them in reaching their conclusions. I don’t understand how the moon got there, so I will ignore all effects associated with it, such as tides. I hope I don’t drown.” And the amazing thing about Dr. Green is that he—and with him Prof. van Pelt, who relies on Green 69 —does not only defend Prof.   519 Arthur R. Butz, “ Historical Past vs. Political Present ”, JHR , 19(6) (2000), pp. 12ff. (online: www.ihr.org/jhr/v19/ v19n6p12_Butz.html)."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"8. E VALUATION OF C HEMICAL A NALYSES 279 Markiewicz’s behavior in every regard, but he attacks me for my cri- tique against the Polish scientists, while omitting all the reasons I gave for doing so. To crown this, Dr. Green even defends the fact that Prof. Markiewicz never even bothered to address any of my critique, even though addressing critiques is paramount for scientists. Dr. Green ar- gues: “Rudolf complains that Markiewicz et al. have not responded to his queries. Why should they do so? What credibility does Rudolf have, that demands they answer his every obj ection no matter how ill-founded?” However, since Dr. Green agrees th at the Iron Blue detectable in disinfestation walls is the result of gassings with Zyklon B, he himself has indirectly admitted that all my objections against Markiewicz’s method of analysis are well-founded, i.e. , just the opposite of “ ill- founded ”. And why does Dr. Green think I bear no credibility demanding a discussion of any of my arguments? Not because I lack scientific quali- fications. No, he thinks I am an abomination because of my views, and because I have been subject to soci al persecution and political prosecu- tion, leading to the total destruction of my social existence, my reputa- tion, and finally my freedom. Dr. Green even resorts to calling me a “ liar ,” “ obfuscator ,” and “ hater ” because of my different well-founded opinions. The scheme is as follows: first, people like Dr. Green attempt to do everything to destroy my reputation by name-calling, persecution, and prosecution, and when they succeed, they claim that there is no need to discuss anything with me anymore, since I do not have any reputation and credibility anyway. This way they can nicely ignore any argument refuting their flawed thesis. And they have the chutzpah to call themselves righteous scientists and to call me a pseudo-scientific liar and obfuscator of the truth. Dr. Green unconditionally defends the scientific frauds from the Cracow institute, and both get away w ith it, because in the eyes of the public, both have the ‘politically correct’ ‘scientific’ opinion about Auschwitz. Birds of the same feather flock together. 8.4.5. Anticipated Values The only case of the formation of Iron Blue through fumigation with hydrogen cyanide, which is fairly well documented, is the case of"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 280 damage to a church in Lower Bavaria as cited above. 22 Even today, buildings are fumigated with hydrogen cyanide, yet Iron Blue is rarely formed. The reason for this, however, is quite obvious. Fumigation with hydrogen cyanide is used to kill vermin, such as woodworm, meal moths, corn beetles, or lice. Howe ver, a massive case of vermin infes- tation requiring the use of hydrogen cyanide occurs, in practice, only in buildings which have already been in use for relatively long periods of time, i.e. , many years. It is therefore to be expected that the interior plaster of such buildings has long since become thoroughly carbonized. Furthermore, the rooms to be fumigated are, as a rule, heated in order to enhance the effectiveness of th e hydrogen cyanide (faster evapora- tion, slower adsorption losses, stimulated metabolism of vermin). Since it is not to be expected, according to the findings presented here, that a perceptible accumulation of cyanides, let alone the formation of Iron Blue, would occur after only one fumigation in warm, dry, and chemically set wall materials, one ca nnot be surprised that such build- ing damage is the exception rather than the rule. The damage to the building in Bavaria is a typical exception here, since the unheated church, notorious for its humid walls, had been plastered with cement mortar, which is known to remain alkaline for many months, only a few weeks before. These are exactly the condi- tions which in my view were favorab le to the formation of Iron Blue. With increasing setting of the cement plaster over the course of months, the pH value of the masonry in the church finally dropped, so that the final reaction led to the formation of Iron Blue, which is stable for long periods of time. This final reaction of the adsorbed cyanide into Iron Blue was only completed after approximately two years. The prior stage of this reaction, the formation of considerably paler iron cyanides, could already have been completed or well progressed prior to this. 520 A comparison with the probable conditions of the disinfestation chambers and alleged homicidal ‘gas chambers’ of the Third Reich is quite informative (see Table 24). The following assumes that both in- stallations (tacitly assuming the existence of the homicidal ‘gas cham- bers’) were put into use more or less immediately after their construc-   520 Incidentally, all the plaster in the church ha d be to knocked off the walls and replaced, since there was no other way to get rid of the Iron Bl ue.

E VALUATION OF C HEMICAL A NALYSES 281 tion, i.e. , at a time when the concrete, mortar, and plaster was still not entirely set. In addition, they were in near-constant use for one to two years. That the entire plaster job on the wall of the church referred to above turned blue even after only one fumigation is explained by the especially (un)favorable circumstances. The alleged ‘gas chambers’ of crematoria II and III in Birkenau show a striking similarity to this case. These cool and moist cellar rooms we re only completed shortly before they were put into service and are th en said to have been exposed to hydrogen cyanide on a constant basis in contrast to the church men- tioned above, which was only fumigated once. Finally, the interesting question of which analytical values were really to be expected, if the reported mass gassings with Zyklon B really occurred in the ‘gas chambers ’ at Auschwitz, must now be ex- amined. First, consideration will be restricted to the morgues 1 of cremato- ria II and III, since sufficient data are only available for these buildings and because it is only here that meaningful samples can be taken, since it is certain that the material is in its original condition. As a comparative value, let us take two of the samples taken by myself from the interior wall of Building 5a: Samples no. 12 and 13, with a total cyanide concentration of 2,900 and 3,000 mg/kg, respec- Table 24: Comparison between cases of building damage, morgue and disinfestation chamber L OCATION P ROPERTY P LASTERING OF CHURCH C REMATORIUM II/III MORGUE 1 D ISINFESTATION BW 5 A / B Iron Content > 1 Weight.-% 1-2 Weight -% 0.5-5 Weight.-% Type of plaster Lime + Cement Cement (+lime?)

The following is a list of individual properties which exert an in- fluence upon the formation of Iron Blue. 1. Properties, which were approximately the same in both installations: – the (alleged) operating time (approximately 1 year) 521 – the (alleged) frequency of use (a few hundred times), 522 even if a document quoted in chapter 5.2.3.5. states that shortly after the putting into operation of these hydrogen cyanide disinfestation chambers, a decision was made to stop using them, see. p. 70. It may therefore well be that the cyanide residues to be found in these disinfestation chambers today result from considerably fewer fumigations. – the (necessary) application concentration. 523 – both installations were (allegedly) put into operation more or less immediately after completion. 524 2. Properties that were advantageous to the formation of Iron Blue in the disinfestation chamber: – the duration of the fumigation times led, in the disinfestation chamber, to a concentration of cyanide in the masonry between 16% and 30% of saturation; in the case of the homicidal ‘gas chambers’, however, only to values of between 1.6% and 8% could be reached (factor 2-19). 525 3. Properties which were advantageous to the formation of Iron Blue in the homicidal ‘gas chambers’: – the morgues possessed cool, moist walls, which have a higher ten-   521 With regards to the homicidal ‘gas chambers’, the period between March 1943 and the fall of 1944 is ‘attested to’. Building 5a was completed in the fall of 1942 ( TCIDK , 502-1-214; acc. to 502-1-22-19, it was completed already by June 20, 1942), but converted to operate with hot air in the summer of 1943 (J.-C. Pressac, op. cit. . (note 67), pp. 55-58; acc. to TCIDK , 502-1- 24, equipment of BW 5a and 5b with hot air disinfestation facility st arted on Nov. 1, 1942). 522 For the homicidal ‘gas chambers’, this follows from the alleged victim totals of several hun- dred thousand victims per chamber; for the de lousing installations, this follows from the maximum number of days available in ¾ of a year (approximately 270 days). 523 See also chapters 7.1. and 7.3.1.3. 524 Crematorium II was completed in February/Mar ch, after which the gassings are alleged to have begun in mid-March or the end of March. W ith relation to the delousing installations, we have no data, but one may assume that the bu ilding was used as soon as it was completed, even if it must be expected that the delousing chambers could not be used for a while, since, for delousing, it was necessary first to install all the equipment after completion of the build- ing, i.e. , undressing rooms, showers, saunas, heating, etc. The same applies, of course, to the crematoria/morgues. 525 See also chapters 7.3.2.2.f."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"8. E VALUATION OF C HEMICAL A NALYSES 283 dency, higher by a factor of 8, to adsorb hydrocyanic than the warm, dry interior walls of the disinfestation chamber under con- sideration (factor 8). 526 – Ceilings and walls of the mor gue consisted of cement mortar and/or concrete, which, due to their longer-lasting alkaline proper- ties and due to their greater specific inner surface area, are able to adsorb and bind hydrogen cyanide for a longer time and more strongly than the cement-poor mortar and plaster of the disinfesta- tion wing under consideration. Quantif ication in this regard is dif- ficult, but a factor in excess of two must be anticipated (factor 2). 527 According to these considerations, the factors indicating that rather more iron cyanide would have had to form in the homicidal ‘gas chambers’ than on the interior walls of the disinfestation chamber in question ( 8×2 2 to 19 ≈ 0.4-8) weigh more heavily. In actual fact, however, the homicidal ‘gas chambers’ contain such low cyanide concentrations that they are neither capable of re producible detection nor of adequate interpretation, but in any case at least some 150 to 10,000 times lower than those detectable in the walls of the disinfestation chambers. Or in plain English: When analyzing wall samples from the al- leged ‘gas chambers’ of crematoria II and III, we ought to expect re- sults which are in the same order of magnitude as the results of sam- ples taken from the walls of the del ousing chambers of BW 5a and 5b. What we do find in those ‘gas chamber’ samples, however, is practi- cally nothing. 8.4.6. Limits of the Chemical Method The most recent development in the official school of thought tends to modify the marginal conditions for the homicidal mass gas- sings, even when this stands in shattering contradiction to the state- ments of eyewitnesses or the technical data.

There is furthermore a tendency towards a strong reduction in the alleged quantity of hydrogen cyanide utilized as compared, for exam- ple, to the quantities alleged by the eyewitnesses. 49,54,55 There is much unfounded fantasizing as to the existence of any ominous Zyklon B introduction devi ces, which would have permitted the toxic gas to be released through holes in the ceiling into the cham- ber—holes which, unfortunately, did not and do not exist—and to be removed again following conclusion of the gassings. 529 Furthermore, the opinion is occasionally expressed that the homi- cidal ‘gas chamber’ was sprayed with a water hose after every gassing. This assertion forgets that it would have lasted many hours until the ‘gas chamber’ could have been cleared of bodies (they had to be cre- mated, which is time-consuming, after all) that the hydrogen cyanide does not merely sit on the surface of the wall, but rather, due to its ex- tremely high diffusion capacity, penetrates deeply into the wall within a few hours, and that a water hose would be of no assistance in this regard, quite apart from the fact that such an action would have had the effect of causing the consequently extremely damp walls to adsorb even more hydrogen cyanide during the next hypothetical gassing. In addition, the samples taken from the ceiling, which was certainly not hosed down, likewise show no repr oducible cyanide concentrations. Yet there are also physical-chemical boundary conditions which can influence the analytical results. It is, for example, not inconceiv- able that, for whatever reason remaining unknown until the present time, the masonry of the alleged ‘gas chambers’ was not, or more slightly, inclined to the formation of Iron Blue, or that possible resi- dues were destroyed for unknown reasons. The assumptions made in relation to the boundary conditions relat- ing to hypothetical homicidal gassings were naturally subject to par- ticular reserves, since no empirical data were available in this regard. Thus the question of how quickly the hydrogen cyanide contained in Zyklon B could diffuse in hypothetical ‘gas chambers’ and how   529 Pressac (note 67) and van Pelt (note 69) are true masters in the composition of such inven- tions.

The assumptions made here are, of course, generally well-founded, but are not infallible.

Conclusions  Even according to the statements of pharmacist J.-C. Pressac, who, in the late 80s and early 90s, was promoted as the technical Holo- caust expert, eyewitness testimonies relating to the engineering of the installations and their capacity are, almost without exception, untenable. But even the corrections to the testimonies considered by Pressac to be necessary do not go far enough to make them credi- ble. In particular, the testimonies relating to the duration of execu- tions in the ‘gas chambers’ (morgue 1) of crematoria II and III, as well as the ventilation times after the executions go completely awry. This is because of the over-estimation of the evaporation rate of hydrogen cyanide from the carrier of Zyklon B, as well as the in- correct concept of the effectiveness of the ventilation of the rooms. If the eyewitness testimonies relating to the quantities of Zyklon B used, and at least approximately relating to the rapidity of the exe- cution procedure are to be accepted, then they are incompatible with testimonies, sometimes of the same witnesses, that the victims’ corpses were removed from the ‘gas chambers’ immediately after the executions and without gas masks and protective garments. This is particularly true for those a lleged ‘gas chambers’ without ventila- tion installations (crematoria IV and V and farmhouses I and II), since working in poorly ventilated ‘gas chambers’ with high con- centrations of poison gas is impossible without gas masks. The ex- treme danger to the sweating workers of the Sonderkommando, who are supposed to have worked without protective garments, makes the witnesses untrustwort hy. The eyewitness accounts are therefore completely contradictory, illogical, contrary to the laws of nature, and therefore incredible. The witnesses engage in particular contortions when it comes to the cremations (amount and kind of fuel used, speed of cremation, development of flames and smoke), which furthermore fail to accord with the analyses of aerial photog- raphy.  The alleged installations for the mass murder of human beings are, in Pressac’s judgment, impractical for their purpose, but were, on the contrary, illogically constructed in parts, so that they would not have been suitable as instruments of mass extermination. Once one"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 288 considers the actual technical requirements, the impression remains of the total inadequacy of the in stallations in question—which were deficient to the point of uselessness—in gross contradiction to the technically advanced disinfestation chambers in the immediate vi- cinity. The facts set forth here with relation to Zyklon B introduc- tion pillars in the ceilings of the ‘gas chambers’ (morgue 1) of cre- matoria I to III strengthen the suspicion of a subsequent manipula- tion almost to a certainty. These installations would have been even less suitable than crematoria IV and V. It would have been impos- sible to introduce the gas into them.  Due to the proven, enormous environmental resistance of Iron Blue pigment, the slight cyanide traces in alleged homicidal ‘gas cham- bers’, which are demonstrable in places, but are not reproducible, cannot be explained on the basis of remaining residues of a disinte- gration process, since even on the weathered exterior side of the disinfestation wing large quantities of cyanide can be found even today. Towards the end of the ope rating period of the installations, therefore, the cyanide content mu st have been present in the same order of magnitude as it is today, as well as in the areas which were never exposed to weathering. But the cyanide values of protected areas in the alleged homicidal ‘gas chambers’ are just as low as in places exposed to weathering. Weathering has, therefore, not actu- ally diminished these slight tr aces. The low cyanide values cannot be explained by fumigation of the premises for vermin, as postu- lated by Leuchter, since such fu migation would probably have left greater quantities of cyanide in the moist cellars of crematoria II and III. The cyanide values of the alleged homicidal ‘gas chambers’ lie in the same order of magnitude as the results, among others, of the samples taken by myself from parts of other buildings (hot air disinfestation Building 5a, inmates barracks, the washroom of cre- matorium I). These values, however , lie so near the detectable threshold that no clear significance can be attributed to them, most importantly due to their lack of reproducibility. From the above, one can safely conclude that no cyanide residues capable of inter- pretation can be found in the walls of the alleged homicidal ‘gas chambers’. It was further possible to show that, under the conditions of the mass gassings as reported by eyewitnesses in the alleged ‘gas chambers’ of crematorium II to V, cyanide residues would have"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"9. C ONCLUSIONS 289 been found in similar quantities, coloring the walls blue, as they can be found in the disinfestation wings of building 5a/b. Since no sig- nificant quantities of cyanide were found in the alleged homicidal ‘gas chamber’, one must conclude that these installations were ex- posed to similar conditions as the above mentioned other installa- tions (hot air disinfestation, inmate barracks, washroom of cremato- rium I), i.e. , that they most likely were never exposed to any hydro- gen cyanide. Final Conclusions A. On chemistry A: The investigation of the formation and stability of cyanide traces in masonry of the indicated structures as well as interpretation of the analytic results of samples of building material from these struc- tures in Auschwitz show: 1. Cyanide reacting in masonry to produce Iron Blue is stable over periods of many centuries. It disintegrates on the same time scale as the masonry itself. Therefore, traces of cyanide should be de- tectable today in almost undiminished concentrations, regardless of the effects of weather. The outer walls of the delousing cham- bers BW 5a/b in Birkenau, which are deep blue and contain high concentrations of cyanide, are evidence of this. 2. Under the physically possible conditions of the mass-gassing of humans with hydrogen cyanide, traces of cyanide must be found in the same range of concentration in the rooms in question as they are found in the disinfestation structures, and the resulting blue discoloration of the walls should likewise be present. 3. In the walls of the supposed ‘g as chambers’ the concentrations of cyanide remnants are no higher than in any other building taken at random. Conclusion to A: On physical-chemical grounds, the mass gassings with hydro- gen cyanide (Zyklon B) in the supposed ‘gas chambers’ of Ausch- witz claimed by witnesses did not take place."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 290 B: On building technology The investigation of the events of alleged mass gassings in the in- dicated rooms claimed by witnesses, from a technical and practical standpoint, including physical-chemical analysis, showed: 1. The extensive documentation on the Auschwitz camp does not contain a single reference to execution ‘gas chambers’; rather it re- futes such suspicions. 2. The supposed main gas chambers of Auschwitz, the morgue hall of the crematorium in the main camp and the morgue cellars I (‘gas chambers’) of crematories II and III, did not have any means for the introduction of poison gas mixtures. Holes in the roofs visible today were made after the war, and all other cracks are the result of the building’s destruction at the end of the war. 3. The release of lethal quantities of hydrogen cyanide from the Zyk- lon B carrier requires many multiples of the time asserted; the ac- tual duration runs to several hours. 4. To provide the necessary ventila tion for the supposed ‘gas cham- bers’ of crematories II and III w ould have taken many hours, con- trary to all witness testimony. 5. It would have been impossible to provide an effective ventilation of the supposed ‘gas chambers’ of crematories IV or V or of farm- houses I and II. The corpses could not have been removed from the rooms and carried away by the Sonderkommando without pro- tective garments and the use of gas masks with special filters.

Hunting Germar Rudolf 11.1. What Makes Revisionists? Bavarian Nostalgia During the early 1980s, in my last three years at high school, I de- veloped a passion for everything Bavarian: the soccer team Bayern München , Lederhosen, the dialect, and, of course, the Bavarian Party, the CSU, 530 which exists in Bavaria only. I also became a fan of Franz- Josef Strauß, who for many decades was chairman of this party and became kind of a symbol for everything Bavarian. I surely would have joined the CSU, also because of its strong conservative views, but un- fortunately this party was open only to those residing in Bavaria, where I never lived. At that time, I also joined the youth organization of Germany’s semi-conservative party CDU, 531 but was active only a short time, be- cause when my university studies took me to Bonn in 1983, I aban- doned all political commitments for the time being. When I started to study chemistry at University of Bonn in the fall of 1983, Bonn, then capital of West Germany, was a hotbed of anti- government demonstrations mainly by leftist students. The German federal government, lead by CDU and CSU, had agreed to the station- ing of Pershing middle range nuclear weapons in Germany by the US. Armed Forces and also planned a census of the German population. Both infuriated the German left, who was strongly opposed to any for- eign military presence in Germany and to any governmental intrusion into the privacy of German citizens. 532 I, on the other hand, took the position held by the German Federal government led by CDU/CSU,   530 Christlich Soziale Union , Christian Social Union. 531 Christlich Demokratische Union , Christian Democratic Union. They actually refused to be called conservative, and rightly so, since only a minority of their members has conservative views, the majority having quite liberal views. The CDU has no section in Bavaria, where the CSU plays its role, though the Bavarian CSU is more conservative than the ‘Prussian’ CDU. 532 Today, the German government consists of t hose who demonstrated against such politics in the 70s and 80s, and as was to be expected, they do even worse in politic s: They wage war in Serbia and Afghanistan, and they are increas ingly dismantling the Germans’ civil rights."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 298 arguing for the census and for the stationing of U.S. nuclear weapons to deter the Soviets. However, my involvement was abruptly curbed when CSU chair- man Strauß engineered a one billion Deutschmark loan to communist East Germany, a deal that contradicted everything Strauß stood for, in particular, the principle that one should never do business with the to- talitarian powers of the East, unless some reciprocal benefit was forth- coming. The reciprocal benefit here, however, was only imaginary in that East Germany’s communist government promised to remove the ‘robot’ machine guns on the inner-German border, which automati- cally killed or maimed every German trying to pass from totalitarian East Germany to ‘Golden’ West Germany. Subsequently, these atro- cious weapons were indeed removed, but this was accompanied by the construction of a second border fence further inland. As a result, the inner-German border became even more impenetrable. Hence, Strauß’ deal did not lead to any humane relief for the East Germans, but in- stead stabilized East Germany’s economy, thus delaying its—as we know today—unavoidable final collapse for a few more years. From today’s perspective, my criticism at the time was entirely justified. But at that time, it was the opinion of a separate minority only, a minority subject to ridicule—it was a ‘peculiar view’. First jail experience In October 1983, I had joined a Catholic student fraternity, founded in Königsberg (East Prussia) in the late 1800s, but relocated to Bonn after WWII. At the end of WWII, almost the entire German population of East Prussia either fled or was murdered and expelled by the invading Soviets who divided this old German province in two parts, annexed the northern part and gave the southern part to Poland. In 1984, a ‘brother’ of this fraternity persuaded me to accompany him on a trip to Czechoslovakia in February of that same year. This frater- nity brother was a student of Catholic theology and had adopted the cause of the suppressed Catholic Chur ch in the then still Stalinist Czechoslovakia. Also, he had acqua intances there, and his parents were from the Sudetenland , a once purely German border region of Czechia, from where most Sudeten -Germans had been expelled or murdered after WWII by the Czechs.

H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 299 minority still living in Czechoslovakia and for the expelled Sudeten- Germans, most of whom had resettled in Bavaria and Austria after WWII. With the knowledge and support of the Catholic Church, we at- tempted to smuggle theological and political books, as well as a photo- copier, to a Catholic congregation in Prague. Our political literature included, for example, a Czech edition of George Orwell’s 1984 , which was forbidden in the then Czechoslovakian Socialist Soviet Re- public. Although the books arrived at th eir destination, the photocopier was discovered at the border and my fraternity brother, another person traveling with us and myself were immediately confined to prison at Pilsen in the west of Czechoslovaki a. After two weeks of nervous wait- ing, without any contact to the outside world, during which I was inter- rogated twice, I was told I could leave. My fraternity brother, however, was later sentenced to a year’s impr isonment. He was forced to remain in jail for ten months until Christmas time 1984, when German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher in tervened and managed to get him released early. Justice, not brute force For many others, this experience might possibly have convinced them to leave controversial topics well enough alone. For me, it was the opposite. Because when I find that I have been the victim of injus- tice, my reaction is to fight until amends are made. It was at this time that I became familiar with the dark side of the Communist dictatorship. I swore to myself in prison, once I was set free, I would combat the evil of Communism. During the following year and a half, I became more involved with those who had been the victim of expulsions: firstly, because my father had been expelled from the east German province Silesia, to- gether with millions of German compatriots (after WWII, Silesia was annexed by Poland and is now its southwestern part); secondly, proba- bly as a result of memories of the fraternity brother mentioned above; and thirdly, from a conviction that the expulsion and persecution of East Germans by the communist dictatorships of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, and the USSR was one of the greatest crimes in history, a crime which ought never be forgotten, trivialized or mini- mized, approved or justified. Paralle ls with the arguments invariably"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 300 made in regards to the persecuti on of the Jews inevitably come to mind. First political thoughts The year 1985 was marked by two events: First, the so-called Engelhard 533 Law was discussed and finally enacted, according to which the offense to dispute, diminish, or justify the crimes of the National Socialist regime, or any other tyrannical re- gime, will be prosecuted automatically, without anybody needing to file a complaint. The original intention of those who started this dis- cussion—the leftist Social-Democrats—was to make it easier for the legal system to prosecute ‘Holocaust deniers’, without the necessity of a complaint by some Jewish individual or organization. Certain seg- ments of Germany’s semi-conservative party—especially those lobby- ing for the German expellees—demanded that this law should also ap- ply to anyone minimizing or justifying the crimes of other dictator- ships, for example, those who minimized or justified the criminal post- war expulsion of Germans from east Germany and eastern Europe. In this discussion, I vigorously took sides on the wing of the con- servatives often disparagingly referred to as the ‘steel helmet fraction’. By then, I had frequently experienced that those working and arguing on behalf of the German expellees are confronted with the argument that the Germans in general and the German expellees in particular have no right to insist on their claims, even if they were supported by international law. After all, since Germany under Hitler had wanted war and started war, and since so much guilt had accumulated as a result of the ‘exter- mination’ or ‘intended exterminati on’ of the Jews and Slavs, any sub- sequent crimes committed against Germans by the peoples of Eastern Europe must be viewed as mere recompense. One had to take this view for the sake of a peaceful life. But by so doing, crimes, when commit- ted against Germans by non-Germans, are considered to constitute a counterbalance to German crimes agai nst other nationals, and are thus accepted as ‘fair punishment’. This is common practice, it is a matter of good conduct in Germany to see it this way. But you will be sorry, should it ever enter your mind to turn this argument around and com- pare and counterbalance German crim es, actual or alleged, with those   533 Named after the then German Secretary of Justice."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 301 of other nationalities. This is, of course, verboten ! In fact, continual reminders of German crimes, whether true or not, were and are still used to suppress any memory of crimes committed against my own people, the Germans, or to discuss justified claims resulting from the allied crimes. No doubts about the indisputable Certainly, it would have been possible to try and dispute these German crimes, actual or alleged, as a means of overcoming the obsta- cles of discussing the crimes committed against Germans. But this course of action was not open to me, since I could neither argue nor act against my strongly held convictions. I was a firm believer in the stan- dard historical account of the extermination of the Jews. This approach was therefore closed to me—it did not even occur to me as a theoreti- cal possibility. The only available way was to take the position that two wrongs do not make a right, and no good could ever come of a wrong. This applies to the National Socialist persecution of the Jews as well as to the expulsion of the Germans. Tackling the Zeitgeist The second significant event of 1985 was my joining a political party called Republikaner (not to be confused with the US Republi- cans). I made contact with this party through my involvement with the youth branch of an organization of Silesian Germans. At that time, these Republikaner were relatively unknown and their members were thought of as conservative patriots, but not as a right-wing radicals. I discovered that this party had orig inated from a split with Bavaria’s conservative party CSU. The reason for some members of the CSU to leave this party and form their own was dissatisfaction with the media- tion of the billion deutschmark loan to communist East Germany by CSU chairman Franz-Josef Strauß, as already mentioned. The party ap- peared to me as a kind of nation-wide CSU—minus the fear and trem- bling in the face of the Eastern bloc, and minus the marked patronage of offices and blatant corruption wh ich was noticeable already then. At first, I thought that this was just the party I had long been look- ing for, at least with respect to German national politics. However, their handling of the subject of immigrants repelled me, because as a Catholic I was very sensitive to progr ams or ideas that appeared to be"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 302 motivated by hostility to foreigners. An anti-fascist climb-down The year 1986 was again marked by two events: First, I came to realize that the Republikaner , at least in the Bonn- Siegburg districts, were mostly a collection of hard-core right-wingers who had been expelled from East Germany after WWII. At the only membership meeting that I attended, it was obvious to me that they could not find anything more important to talk about than the question of whether and to what extent West Prussia was German, and whether territorial claims to it could be asserted. This complete withdrawal from political reality accompanied by a failure to recognize that which was politically necessary at the time the world was debating the reun- ion of West and East Germany, contributed to my decision to leave the Party. The most compelling reason for my decision was a recognition that the party included more than a few former members of the right- wing radical party NPD, 534 with whom I wanted no contact. After a membership of half a year, I left the party in early or middle 1986. The second event that I wish to discuss here took place in January 1986, at a convention to celebrate the 115 th anniversary of the founding of the German Reich in 1871, organized by the student fraternity Ver- ein Deutscher Studenten (VDSt, Association of German Students), and held in Frankfurt. It was at this convention that I first learned that the VDSt Frankfurt was a nationalistically oriented student organization. And it was after this celebration that I had a long argument with a stu- dent member of this organization who claimed to be a member of the nationalist party NPD. The subject of our argument was the extermina- tion of the Jews. He maintained that the established description did not fit the facts, and that there were not, in reality, six million victims, but three million at most. I was appalled by this manner of argument, and will explain why. Repulsive numbers juggling First, there was the natural repugnance aroused by a line of argu- ment which tended merely to diminish a few numbers, although the   534 Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands , National Democratic Party of Germany."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 303 issue is not really the actual numbers, but the intention behind the deed. My belief at that time was that Hitler had planned to exterminate the Jews, and had done whatever had been necessary to accomplish this goal. The actual ‘how’ and ‘ how many’ were of secondary impor- tance. From the student’s style of argument, it was clear that he had strong political motives for his way of thinking. He spoke of the use of the ‘Auschwitz bludgeon’ against the political right, and in particular, against his party. His mixture of political objectives and scientific ar- gumentation made me skeptical. I could not take his arguments at face value, because I was unable to trust hi m. I silently reproached him for his political involvement, believing that he was no longer willing or able to distinguish between truth and falsehood, between the justified and the unjustified. I have forgotten his exact argumen ts and conclusions. Perhaps I do him an injustice, but I still retain a bitter taste of his unbending, politi- cally-motivated way of thinking. It is possible that this is merely an impression I had, because at the time, I thought of all NPD members as extremists with dishonest intentions. It is therefore possible that it wasn’t the NPD member who had a distorted view of things, but rather, that I saw him distortedly by my own prejudices. That question will never be answered. Politics prevents doubt What can one say today about that event? Although I had dealt with this Holocaust ‘denier’ and w as well aware of the reality of the political misuse of the ‘Auschwitz bludgeon’ against the political right or right-wing oriented people, this did not lead to my doubting the truth of the usual historical version of the National Socialist persecu- tion of the Jews. The reason was that I could not, and cannot, take seri- ously any position maintained for obviously political reasons. In the years that followed, I devoted myself chiefly to my studies; in 1986, I had entered the demanding graduate phase of my studies with subsequent preparation for the Diplom examination. 535 During this period, I abandoned all political activity and withdrew from my work with German refugee organizations and with my student fraternity. This was due not only to my academ ic work load, but also because I   535 Regarding its difficulty, the German Diplom is almost an equivalent to an Anglo-Saxon PhD."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 304 had had my fill of nonsense and no longer cared about activities which were partially unrealistic and mostly useless. Turks into the ‘gas chamber’? The pressure let up in the year 1989, as I had just completed my Diplom examinations and therefore enjoyed some free time for differ- ent intellectual pursuits. The same year was also marked by two sig- nificant events. The first event was the elections for the Berlin Chamber of Depu- ties, during which the Republikaner gained their famous (or infamous) entry into the city’s parliament. Like most people, I was completely surprised by this outcome, since I had lost almost all contact with this party. But, in contrast to most other people, I had some idea of what the Republikaner were, and were not. The horrifying media witch-hunt against this party immediately fo llowing the electoral success infuri- ated me. Characteristic of this witch-hunt was the question posed by a journalist on election eve to Bernhard Andres, then party chairman in Berlin, as to whether the Republikaner wished to do to the Turks what Hitler had done to the Jews. That was when things turned sour. It was clear to me in the flash of a moment’s insight that I would rejoin the Republikaner out of pure defiance and democratic solidarity, even if I was displeased by some things about this party. One could take or leave a few isolated party positions as one wished. As long as the party was in compliance with the German constitution, it was entitled to treatment on the basis of equality. Of course, nothing that has happened since then bears any resem- blance to democracy. Party meetings were regularly harassed or pro- hibited, although Germans were guaranteed the freedom of assembly as a ‘basic right’. The print and electronic news media were instructed to report nothing but negative informati on about this party, a fact not in conformity with the standards of ethics and the legal duty of the pub- licly-funded news media to report the news with objectivity. The establishment parties placed the Republikaner beyond the pale of democracy and constitutional politics. It was therefore those estab- lishment parties who had violated the constitutional right of the Repub- likaner to equal treatment, as well as to the freedoms of expression and assembly."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 305 Professional disbarment due to loyalty to the constitution One of my close friends, a long-time member of Germany’s semi- conservative party CDU, had recently completed his studies in civil administration and was assigned to the city government of a large city in Saxony during his period of practical training. He then received or- ders from his supervisor, a CDU member, to prohibit the planned re- gional party convention of the Republikaner . Since it was his specific duty as a civil servant to respect the provisions of the German constitu- tion, he refused to obey these orders on the grounds that the Repub- likaner were a legally constituted pa rty, the unconstitutionality or un- democratic nature of which has remained unproven. Therefore, in ac- cordance with the principle of equa l treatment for political parties, as well as with the rights of free assembly and a respect for the duty of democratic parties to hold regular meetings of their members, their party convention could not lawfully be prohibited. The consequence of this disobedience was that my friend was told that he would not be able to complete his period of practical training. To avoid forced termination during this period, my friend agreed to a termination agreement to become effective subsequent to this training. His concomitant attempt to fight the agreement in the Labor Court naturally failed. In Germany, t hose who defend the constitution are dumped on the street, while those who continually violate the constitu- tion enjoy offices and power while the media cheer them on. ‘Reprehensible’ German unity I need to discuss another reason for my rejoining the Republikaner in 1989. My belief that one should hold fast to the unity of the German Fatherland has never changed. The left-wing German party SPD 536 had abandoned the goal of reunification in the mid-70s, while the left-wing radical GRÜNE (Greens) had always supported the division of Ger- many into two independent states. The small liberal party FDP 537 fol- lowed in the mid-80s in their s upport for two independent German states, and towards the end of the 80s, even within the semi- conservative CDU calls to put off the German reunification forever became louder and louder. In this connection (I believe it was in 1987),   536 Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands , Socialdemocratic Party of Germany. 537 Freie Demokratische Partei , Free Democratic Party."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 306 I remember the commentary of Dr. Helmut Kohl, then leader of the CDU and German chancellor, on a position paper of a certain CDU Member of Parliament, Bernhard Friedmann, concerning German re- unification, which Dr. Kohl described as “ blooming nonsense ”. After the political sea-change of 1983, wh en the semi-conservative/liberal CDU/FDP coalition replaced that of the socialist/liberal SPD/FDP government of the decade before, the new government dissolved all governmental departments in charge of administrative preparations for a German reunification. The left wing of the CDU, under Rita Süss- muth, Heiner Geißler and Norbert Blüm, campaigned openly for dual statehood. In the summer of 1989, the Federal Council of the CDU youth organization Junge Union (Young Union) took the initiative to recommend the deletion of the political goal of German reunification from the party program of the CDU– just a few months before the Ber- lin Wall fell and Germany actually was reunified! Now that Germany is reunited, a devastating judgment must be passed upon all the established political parties with regards to their political competence. From the standpoint of the present, the Repub- likaner were the only party, of those involved at the time, with a cor- rect estimation of the historical and political forces, even if they were subsequently booted out by the turncoats of reunification. I was in the party because all the other parties had abandoned, or were about to abandon in an absolutely unconstitutional manner, the principle of re- unification, a principle laid down in the preamble to the German con- stitution. It is significant also that my membership in the Republikaner , which ended in the summer of 1991, was later used by the District Court Stuttgart as an indicator of my political mania— in full knowl- edge of what I have just described. Nowadays, support for the mainte- nance of constitutional political principles is deemed reprehensible, if not outright illegal. Further comments are superfluous. Ready to go into a new era... The young people that streamed into the Republikaner party at that time wanted to do something for German reunification, since this was impossible in almost any other political party.

But among us students in Frankfurt, where I completed work for my diploma thesis and later performed my compulsory military service, 538 this plate of mixed vegetables was intellectually very fruitful. In the newly founded Republikaner university organization, we had one former member of the liberal party FDP, one from the socialist party SPD, one from the conservative ecologist party ÖDP, 539 three from the semi-conservative CDU, and many who were active for the first time. During this time, we were flooded with new ideas and discussed controversial issues as never before. In this Frankfurt period, which e nded in late 1990, I read nearly 200 books, mostly during my ‘loafer-service’ in the Bundeswehr : I read right-wing and left-wing books, books from the middle-of-the- road, and books without any political viewpoint. It was one of the best times I have ever experienced. It was like preparing for an intellectual break-out. ...but instead into the offside Our interest in involvement with the Republikaner party disap- peared due to the fact that it w as extremely anti-academic, both in its ranks and leadership. We had to let ourselves be mocked and called greenhorns and academic egg-heads by other members, and the work of our high-school organization was torpedoed by the Republikaner leadership which led to our resignation. From 1990 onwards, the Re- publikaner party has concerned itself mostly with internal conflicts; since every initiative for construc tive work was received with mali- cious criticism, I resigned in the summer of 1991, about nine months after my relocation to Stuttgart in order to start my PhD studies.

Wouldn’t it have been easy to have introduced the idea of disputing the Holocaust at such a time? I had a chance to do this in the spring of 1989, when one of my friends, who had left the ‘liberal’ FDP shortly before to join the Repub- likaner , addressed the Holocaust issue in one of our discussions. He recommended that I read the book Was ist Wahrheit , (What is Truth) by the socialist Frenchman, Professor Paul Rassinier. 30 This may be regarded as the first fully revisionist book ever published. It deals with the supposed extermination of the Jews from the point of view of a former member of the French Resi stance who had been incarcerated by the Germans in several concentration camps during WWII. The remarkable thing about the book is its author. Since he was in- terned in several concentration cam ps as a member of the Resistance and was a pronounced left-winger—before and after WWII, he was a French member of parliament for the leftist socialists—he could not be accused of wanting to whitewash anything or of having any kind of political agenda. Written in a factual and balanced style, the book was easy to read; we discussed it, and that was all. I felt no need to devote myself further to the subject, either through the examination of further revisionist or establishment literature or through undertaking my own investigations.

That ‘coming to terms with the past’ could lend itself to misuse for dirty schemes is obvious. From my own experience, I can think of three notable cases, where prominent German figures were driven out of office and their reputation destroyed by political and media smear campaigns. In such cases, the media and/or competing colleagues ei- ther use (allegedly) ‘brown spots’ in the CV of the attacked individu- als’ WWII history, or they distort and/or instrumentalize ‘politically incorrect’ statements certain individuals made in public or private about Germany’s WWII past. 541 Whatever the CV or the statements about the past of the victims of these campaigns are; the treatment which they receive by colleagues a nd the media must arouse the suspi- cion that the German past is being used today as a weapon of political intrigue against undesirables in one’s own political party, in other par- ties, or in general against any unwelcome professional competitor. The question of how true the historical picture is that hides behind the ‘coming to terms with the past’ Mohler handled only peripherally in this early edition of his book. His new book, which I read in the fall of 1989, goes into this question very thoroughly and thereby naturally brings up the question of the validity of historical revisionism— something which first became clear to me while reading the book. That I got hold of this book was due not so much to its contents, which I previously knew nothing about, but more to my interest in the analyses of a Swiss political scientist, someone writing from what I considered to be a neutral position. ...and an apolitical American... This Swiss author also reported about a study on the alleged ‘gas chambers’ at the Auschwitz concentration camp. This study, so Moh- ler, had been prepared by an American expert for execution technolo- gies, who had come to the conclusion that there had never been any gassings with poison gas in Auschwitz. One of his main arguments was the absence of traces of the poi son gas supposedly used in the walls of those locations identified as homicidal ‘gas chambers’. Since this was a quite intriguing argument, I decided to order a copy of this   541 The names of those persons are: Hans Filb inger, Philipp Jenninger, and Werner Höfer."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 310 study, for which Dr. Mohler even provided an address in his book. Thus were the factors brought together that I needed to compel me to get to the bottom of the problem: the report of an author I held to be politically neutral of a study by an apolitical non-partisan American on a discipline in which I had recently completed my diploma examina- tion: Chemistry. ...enabled me to doubt At that point, I was ready to put to the test my hitherto held opin- ion on the correctness of the estab lished Holocaust dogma, because I had been presented with arguments from politically neutral persons that I could examine by means of my technical skill. In late summer 1989, I received an English copy of the so-called Leuchter Report , which I have just mentioned, and I read and trans- lated it into German immediately, but the report did not convince me entirely, because it was inexact at points and contained sloppy errors, as I described extensively in a letter to the editor published in the small right-wing monthly newspaper Junge Freiheit in 1990. But the Leuchter Report had embedded the thorn of doubt in my heart. I must now explain what that meant, since therein lies the real reason for my involvement. Would only morons doubt? It is generally known that none of the world’s religions reproaches its adherents for doubting the faith. Religion teaches us that to doubt is human, and therefore acceptable. One who doubts is not guilty as a result. After reading the Leuchter Report , I began to doubt whether the historically accepted view of the even ts of the Holocaust was correct. I nevertheless felt guilty, because in western societies we are imbued with our mother’s milk that the history of the Holocaust is the purest truth, and those who doubt or deny this are evil or insane: extremists, National Socialists, Jew-haters, ethnic persecutors, weak-minded, mo- rons, idiots, fruitcakes, cranks, crooks, anti-Semites, and so forth. Yet, through a purely chemical argument, the thorn of doubt had been deeply embedded and I could only get rid of it by plucking it out or trying to forget it. I doubted, and felt guilty for doubting; yet I knew that it is not right to feel guilty for doubting."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 311 From pole star to shooting star Religions expect their adherents to believe in certain dogmas, but they do not demand doubters to feel guilty. At least the same must ap- ply to science, where doubters should not be expected to feel guilty either. Here I was confronted with chemical-historical questions, and ideally speaking, science knows no dogmas, knows no compulsion to obedience, and no punishments for those who contradict the prevalent paradigm. I therefore asked myself, why do western societies guard the Holocaust dogma closer than any religion does its own dogmas? The reason is certainly that western societies, and in particular German so- ciety, regards the Holocaust as one of their moral foundations. This I have explained elsewhere, in the book Dissecting the Holocaust . 542 The German elites almost uniformly mainta in that the health and wealth of the German Republic depends on the observance of current description of the Holocaust. In the German Re public, we are raised with the con- viction that the Holocaust is the moral pole star of our world-view, with respect to which everything else must be oriented. That was my own unconscious belief until I began to question the standard historical version of the Holocaust. When these doubts sur- faced, I was confronted with the possibility that the pole star might turn out to be only a meteor, that everything which had been held as fundamental truth may in reality be false. Motivations Here then are the reasons I have dedicated myself to revisionism: 1. Because of my upbringing, I felt bad merely for doubting. I knew something was wrong with a society when it instills guilt-feelings in its members simply because they dissent. The Holocaust is the one area, and almost the only area, where one is admonished to accept facts blindly; not to think critically. We are taught to ques- tion practically everything else, even that which is kept in high re- gard, such as the reality of God, or sexual intimacy. We are primed to be docile subjects and kept fearful of any transgressions with respect to the Holocaust. That angered me then and it angers me still.   542 2 nd edition, Theses & Dissertations Press, Chicago, IL, 2003, pp. 49-53."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 312 2. Because of my doubts, my entire outlook on life became unstable. I was no longer certain what was correct or incorrect, who lied and who told the truth. The eternal conflict of good and evil was re- vived in me. The question where the truth could be found concern- ing the Holocaust was so important, that I knew I could only re- cover my peace of mind by finding out for myself, personally, where the truth lay. I wanted to rid myself of uncertainty one way or the other. 3. There is no scientific area in which those who hold dissident opin- ions are persecuted more mercilessly by the ‘ruling order’ than that of revisionism. That is probably why most people don’t want to touch it, and most avoid it by convincing themselves that the subject is not relevant to current problems. But for me, this draco- nian persecution is the best proof there is that this is a crucial sub- ject, because the powers that be regard it as most important that nobody touches this taboo. Comprehensive and critical research in this area is therefore very important for scientific, political and so- cial reasons. 543 4. The treatment of revisionism and its proponents in areas of sci- ence, journalism, politics and law is a scandal worldwide—it de- mands redress. Almost stopped... Up to the beginning of my PhD studies in the fall of 1990, I had read only two books on the subject: Wilhelm Stäglich’s Der Auschwitz Mythos 41 and the book by Kogon and others entitled Nationalsozial- istische Massentötungen durch Giftgas . 42 After reading these books I collected information on the so-called Zündel trial in order to find out what arguments had been made there. I had discovered in winter 1989/1990 that Zündel, who had commis- sioned the Leuchter Report , was an admirer of Adolf Hitler. This reve- lation had the equivalent effect of a kick in the stomach, because now I had to deal with the possibility that the Leuchter Report was not the independent report of an apolitical American technician, but merely the instrument of a German-Canadian Ne o-Nazi. But such considerations could not remove the points made by Leuchter and therefore could not   543 See also my paper “ Wissenschaft und ethische Verantwortung ”, in Andreas Molau (ed.), Op- position für Deutschland , Druffel-Verlag, Berg am Starnberger See 1995, pp. 260-288."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 313 remove my doubts about the historical picture. In other words, I fully realized that a fact-oriented argument re- mains a fact-oriented argument—and n eeds to be treated as such by the examining scientist—even if it came from somebody who stated them for political reasons. ...but then getting into gears I began my own research into this area at the beginning of 1991, at first out of pure personal curiosity regarding the question whether the pigment Iron Blue that developed in the walls of the buildings, where gassings with hydrogen cyanide fro m Zyklon B allegedly had taken place, were sufficiently stable to still be there today. After that had been proved, I concentrated on the question if, when, how, and under what circumstances this pigment could develop in walls of different compositions. A revisionist had read my letter to the editor of Junge Freiheit in 1990, mentioned above, and after a phone conversation, he sent me a list of addresses of persons and orga nizations—almost all of them un- known to me. After I had sent out my first research results in spring 1991 to this list, I was contacted by one person on that list, a friend of ret. Major General Otto Ernst Remer, a retired Wehrmacht officer. At that time, Remer was engaged in publishing political pamphlets, some of which made quite blunt revisionist statements, which had led to several criminal prosecutions against him. Because of this, his friend and the Düsseldorf lawyer Hajo Herrmann, a well-known former Luftwaffe fighter pilot who was now Remer’s defense attorney, were looking for an expert to support Remer’s revisionist claims. At that time, it even appeared to be possible for me to work jointly with the Institut für Zeitgeschichte (Institute for Contemporary His- tory), an official German left-wing historical institute, whose address was on that list as well. However, th ey never responded to my letters, apparently because they were not inte rested in the technical-scientific side of the problem. In summer 1991, I decided to leave the Republikaner party. I have already given the reasons for my decision. An additional and decisive motivation was that I did not want my involvement with revisionism to be interpreted politically because of my membership of a party or that"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 314 my scientific activity in this contr oversial area would conflict with the political goals or principles of any party. Sheer horror... I should mention another reason that may be helpful toward un- derstanding my involvement. Until my first trip to Auschwitz- Birkenau, I had had no exact idea of the condition of the camp’s for- mer crematoria, in which the alleged ‘gas chambers’ were located, so I had no idea whether it would actually be useful to undertake technical or chemical research. Before my first trip, I had thoroughly prepared myself as to what I might expect with respect to the material remains at, for example, ‘gas chambers’, if the generally accepted reports of the mass gassings in Birkenau were corr ect. It was clear to me, for exam- ple, if one was to believe the eye-witnesses, that the roofs of the morgues of crematoria II and III should show three or four holes through which Zyklon B was to have been thrown into the room. On August 16, 1991, as I stood on the roof of morgue 1 of crema- toria II at Birkenau, which was usua lly designated as the ‘gas chamber’ where the most mass-murders of the Third Reich were said to have taken place, a roof which was in various stages of collapse and yet still held together and partially rested on supporting columns; a roof in which I could find neither breath nor trace of these holes, so that I asked myself whether I lived in a world of madmen. I found myself horribly duped by a judiciary which had never thought it necessary to make any special technical examinations of the alleged crime scene. I had been lied to by all the politicia ns of the world who to date had failed to assemble even the most minuscule investigation commission. I had been deceived by the innumerable ‘Holocaust historians’ who to date had not deemed it necessary to make any investigation of the camps of Auschwitz or elsewhere, examinations which paleontologists and historians of antiquity have undertaken on the sites of ruins and other remains of ancient settlements. And I felt betrayed by the natural scientists and engineers world-over who swallowed any and every story whatsoever from the ‘eye-w itnesses’ without so much as a mur- mur that the material remains, th e supposed crime scenes, and the eye- witness testimony itself should be subjected to some rudimentary scru- tiny."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 315 ...leads to the collapse of a world-view On this 16th of August, 1991, my world-view collapsed and I swore to do whatever necessary to a dvance clarification to this com- plex of questions. I will only abandon my position when my doubts are confirmed or rejected through convinc ing scientific arguments in a fair scientific discourse. Use of force will never change this position. On the contrary: it fortifies my conviction that I am right, because only he who lacks arguments must use force. And since I have been chased all over the world ever since by all sorts of government with brute force, I now know that I must be right. The Eros of Cognition In time, a further motivation was added to those mentioned above, namely what I call the ‘Eros of Cognition.’ Whoever calls himself a scientist and has not experienced this, is not, in my opinion, a real sci- entist. The excitement of taking part in decisive scientific research and discoveries, to push things forwar d which one knows are new and even revolutionary, the consciousness of standing at the forefront and help- ing direct ‘whither the ship of discovery goest’– those are things that one must know first-hand, in order to understand what is ‘Eros of cog- nition’."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 316 11.2. The Naiveté of a Young Revisionist A Fleeting Acquaintance In February 1991, I attended a sem inar in Bad Kissingen put on by a Sudeten -German youth organization—I was not a member but had been invited. Toward the end of the seminar, I got to know another participant of about my age. He sugg ested that before we departed we pay a visit to Wehrmacht Generalmajor Otto Ernst Remer, who lived in that town. Remer, I was told, was the person who had suppressed the Putsch of July 20, 1944, against Hitler, and I was told he held fast to his views of that time. Our intended visit would be a little bit like a visit to a mu- seum containing a living political fossil. I was curious, so I agreed and off we went. To a young man from a bourgeois home who had been fed a steady diet of anti-fascism, the living room of General and Frau Remer was creepy—Hitler busts, military deco rations and all kinds of propa- ganda hand-outs caused a shiver to run down my back. We were given a tour of the house by Frau Remer and then treated to a showing of a video-film that portrayed the events of July 20, 1944, from Remer’s viewpoint. Thus ‘enlightened’, after an hour we left for home. 544 Freedom to Witness In summer 1991, when I was request ed by Remer’s attorney to prepare an expert opinion on the ‘gas chambers’ of Auschwitz for a   544 Moreover, the Remer couple could remember as little from this chance meeting as from the two subsequent occasions on which I met them, when I appeared as an unknown, unimportant person among a crowd.

The Remers came to know me person- ally only in January 1995, when the Stuttgart Dist rict Court went to Spain to interrogate the Remer couple as part of the trial against me on account of the commentary that Remer had added to the report without asking me. Even then in Spain they needed to ask who I was. They got to know me fairly well only after I had fled to Spain in early 1996, where I resided for four months some 50 miles west of Remer’s residence in exile."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 317 criminal trial against his client, I well knew the client for whom I would be acting. It was clear to me that there was a danger that Remer’s political opinions and activiti es could rub off on ‘his expert witness’, if the witness came to a ‘ politically incorrect’ conclusion. Why I nevertheless decided to proceed is as follows. In a state under the rule of law, a witness, including an expert wit- ness, can not be punished for what he says before the court or for what he presents in writing to the court, in good conscience and to his best understanding. Also, in civil law an expert witness is only liable if it can be proven that he violated the rules and accepted practices of his profes- sion in producing his report and in so doing caused someone bodily or mental harm. Therefore, when an expert witness through painstaking effort evaluates all available sources and interprets them in a technically sound manner, in good conscience and to his best understanding, then even if the conclusions of the expe rt report were wrong he could not be made liable for any gross negligence. Consequently, he could defend himself at law against any civil disadvantages that resulted from the presentation of a possibly politi- cally incorrect expert report because a witness—here an expert wit- ness—may not be made to suffer for having testified in good con- science and to his best understanding. Though I could see there were storms threatening to come my way, I looked on them placidly since I believed that having the law on my side gave me the upper hand. May one publish expert opinions? It was intended from the beginning that the expert report arising from this request of Remer’s attorney would be publishe d. It is unusual to publish expert reports from judi cial proceedings, but it does happen when the subject is of public interest. Expert reports drawn up for sev- eral trials against supposed National Socialist war criminals, for exam- ple, were later made available to a wide public for educational pur- poses. The Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial is a prime example of this. The expert reports produced during this trial by scientists at the Institut für Zeitgeschichte were later published as a collection. 545   545 H.

The original document prepared for the court was enlarged by numerous substantial additions and the layout was improved. In summer 1992, the German publishing houses Ullstein-Langen Müller and von Hase & Köhler showed active interest in the project. Dr. Fleißner, head of the Ullstein- Langen Müller publishers, quickly got cold feet due to the controver- sial nature of the theme, desp ite initial agreement, but von Hase & Köhler wasted no time presenting me with a signed contract. The prob- lem with this contract was that it did not contain any specification as to when the book should appear. This meant publication could have been put off indefinitely while my hands were tied by my contractual agree- ment. When I pressed them to fix this they lost interest. Waiting for the Doctor Social and legal repression was a hint that the theme was a hot one, even when it was handled in a dry, scientific manner. On the ad- vice of various people, I decided to postpone the publication of the document by a politically right-leaning publisher until after I had re- ceived my PhD degree. In the European right-wing scene, the appearance of my report was awaited with increasing impatience throughout 1992; it was ex- pected that my report would contribute decisively to a breakthrough of historical revisionism. Various people began to prepare openly for the coming publica- tion. I regarded these activities with mixed feelings and often needed to point out that my doctorate woul d not be properly completed until many months hence. At the beginning of 1992, I reckoned that I could be in possession of the much-desired degree in the fa ll. Because of the workload of my doctoral supervisor Prof. von Schneri ng, however, I extended this pe- riod several times. I ended waiting five more months to February, 1993, until Prof. von Schnering began to proofread my dissertation. Various Distributions Activities I came into conflict with German-Canadian revisionist Ernst Zündel in this time, because in summer 1992, without my knowledge, he gave out copies of the report as prepared for the court in February, 1992. In November, again without my knowledge, he went so far as to"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 319 translate this outdated version of my report into English. Later he let it be known that he would like to be reimbursed for his translation costs to the amount of $10,000. I had a more pleasant experience with an attorney in Austria, Dr. Herbert Schaller. In February, 1993, he asked me if he could have 100 copies of the report to distribute discreetly in Austrian high society. Up to that point, I had made a total of 50 copies of the report by photocop- ier and glued in color photos by ha nd, which was an enormous labor. I told the attorney that since my doc toral supervisor had begun to work on my dissertation, I had no time to make 100 copies for him. How- ever, I agreed that he could make copies from the copy he had and could distribute those—on the condition that he do so as discreetly as I myself had done already without accompanying commentary and without public propaganda. As far as I know, Dr. Schaller did make and distribute 100 copies in February or March, 1993. To this day, there has been no public re- port of his action. Remer Acts As fate would have it, the Austrian attorney Dr. Schaller was also one of Otto Ernst Remer’s defense attorneys. Remer must have heard about the distribution of my report in Austria. Shortly thereafter, I was informed by one of Remer’s frie nds, and without Remer’s knowledge, as I found out later, concerning Remer’s intention to do in Germany what his lawyer had done in Austria. According to what I was told, Remer intended to do exactly as the Austrian had done. But because Germany is more than ten times larger than Austria, Remer and his friends intended to do their distribution activity more professionally by having my expert report printe d instead of photocopied. Though I knew this could put my PhD degree in jeopardy, I saw no reason to intervene. Naively I thought that Remer would stick to the rules the Austrian had followed, which were perhaps too natural to me to be pointed out specifically: the report must remain unaltered, no addi- tional text, no public propaganda is to be made. As we shall see, these rules were not considered natural by Remer and his friends."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 320 The Bull in the China Shop In March, 1993, with a furious publicity campaign, Remer an- nounced as a measure of self-defense that he was going to publish and distribute that piece of exculpatory evidence that he was not permitted to present to the court, because th e Holocaust is assumed to be self- evident. 546 Thereby Remer broke the first unconditional rule for the protection of my doctoral title, namely that there be no accompanying public propaganda. Thinking that this writing would only circulate in Remer’s circle of supporters, I paid little attention. When I received a phone call from a journalist of a west German radio station, informing me that some of those advertising sheets had surfaced at the University of Cologne, the situation changed. Soon the management of the Fre- senius Institute was on the telephone asking me what was in the re- port—the Fresenius Institute had an alyzed the masonry samples from Auschwitz for me. They hinted that they might consider joining me in taking legal action against Remer. An hour later the Institute’s attorney was threatening me with legal action. Remer had become a bull in the china shop. Between a Rock and a Rock My situation was precarious. At the request of an attorney, I had prepared an expert opinion to be used in the defense of his client. The conclusion of the report was potentially capable of reducing the culpa- bility of said client with respect to the criminality of some of his fac- tual assertions. I intended to publish the report a few months after completing my doctoral work anyway. Now the client took the step of publishing the report at a time that was uncomfortably early and, what was worse and unexpected, with an unhealthy press campaign. Should I now take him to court after having helped him in court? Should I take him to court for doing what I intended to do myself in a few months, though with a smaller or different press campaign? 547 After all, I had   546 Chapter 244 of the German Criminal Code provi des that the court may reject evidence on the grounds of ‘common knowledge’ or complete uns uitability.

The Industrious Additions As if Remer’s industrious public ity campaign were not enough, in April 1993, as my expert report was handed out for the first time, I learned that a one-page foreword and a five-page appendix consisting of a description of Remer’s criminal trial had been added to my re- port. 548 I was not the least bit interested in whether or not the added commentary was criminally relevant. I only glanced at the forward and took no notice of the trial description added after the end of my report. I was aggravated in that Remer had expanded and thus altered the text without authorization. Never mind what was in the commentary—it did not have my approval and that was aggravating enough. But now that this report of mine had been printed, what could I do about it? I thought that it was obvious that I c ould not be held responsible for something whose addition to my re port I had had no knowledge of, not to mention that I had neither given my agreement to it nor had partici- pated in its preparation. So why should I care whether the content of Remer’s commentary was criminal? As a matter of fact, I basically ignored Remer’s comments. So it happened that I perused Remer’s commentary for the first time at the end of 1994, fully one and three quarters of a year afterward, after my own criminal indictment because of that commentary. The Hot Potato In any case, in early 1993, I was concerned only about my doc- toral work. This also was due to a passage in Remer’s appendix, which my doctoral supervisor held under my nose shortly after he—as all professors of chemistry in Germany—had received his copy. In the above-mentioned report on Remer’s criminal trial, I had been men- tioned in connection with the Max-Planck-Institute for Solid State Re- search in Stuttgart.

It was my private activity. However, the fact that I was referred to in Remer’s appendix as an “ expert from the Max-Planck-Institute ” had the conse- quence that the German news media and scientific, legal, and political circles unleashed a storm over the Max-Planck-Institute and demanded to have my head. At the insistence of the Institute, I consulted an attor- ney specializing in copyright law. He, however, made it clear to me that no ‘serious’ attorney would touch such a hot potato, both from conviction and for the sake of his reputation. Also, it was not clear whether I had any ground of action against Remer, since the copyright had probably gone to him because he had ordered and paid for the re- port as I had admitted. 549 The question of the copyright to the report has never been cleared up. The Remers always held the position that they have the copyright to the report because they paid for it, and that they can do with it as they please. There was a contractual agreement set to paper, but unfor- tunately I lost my copy as a result of house searches and changes of abode, and the Remers could not find their copy after their flight to Spain, so that the actual contents of the document cannot be deter- mined. I remember only that I was promised to be reimbursed for ex- penses that I incurred through the production of the report, and that in turn I was supposed to publish my expert report, but no time limit was given for that. The copyright was not discussed.

At the start of May, I finally succeeded in persuading him to curtail his distribution activities because of the reprisals I was ex- periencing. Aside from any legal aspect of Remer’s commentary, I would like to make a few observations. First, Remer’s remarks were composed in a style that would insult any aver age anti-fascist citizen—and that would be about 95% of the population. One could well assume for that   549 I was only paid expenses."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 323 reason alone that most recipients of this version of the report would toss it into the wastebasket unread. Not only that, but Remer had done something that would cause nearly all his recipients who possessed a spark of pride to consign the piece to the fire. In his foreword on th e inside front cover, he attacked our leading politicians, media people, and jurists with the words, “ These Liars need to be driven from their spoils fortresses ”. At the same time, Remer sent this version of my report to exactly these leading politicians, media people, and jurists, and apparently be- lieved he could achieve some success thereby. It is certain that to send a piece of writing to someone in which he is criticized and threatened is a useless exercise. Remer’s defense action must have cost him thou- sands of Dollars—all for nothing. In the Talons of Justice After I had stopped Remer’s defense action, the legal process ran its course. It was my thinking that no one could touch me for some- thing I had not done. But the State’s A ttorney had to investigate, since many of those to whom Remer had sent his copies had filed criminal complaints against him and against me: the German Society of Chem- ists, many State Attorneys and Chief State Attorneys, Judges and Presidents of District Courts and Fe deral Courts, left-wing party repre- sentatives from various parliaments, professors of various disciplines from universities throughout Germany, and on and on and on. Not to mention that there were continual inquiries from Tel Aviv that persist even today. Strangely, the State Attorneys were active only against me. They made inquiries about Remer, but saw no need to search his house. With respect to Remer, they were satisfied to push papers around. With re- spect to me, over the following y ears they searched my house three times and took away everything that was not nailed down. Apparently, German justice did not consider Remer to be dangerous. The Remer problem, they probably thought, would solve itself biologically. My case, however, they decided, needed extra effort.

I have described this in chapter 11.3. “ Flaws of the State Under the Rule of Law ”. 550 On January 19, 1996, the Federal General State Attorney determined that I was to spend 14 months behind bars, not for my report but for Remer’s commentary. The Federal Supreme Court concurred with this sentence in a decision on March 7, 1996 (Ref. 1 StR 18/96). On Remer’s commentary, the District Court of Stuttgart stated in passing sentence (Ref. 17 KLs 83/94, S. 115): “Although the foreword and afterwar d did not explicitly accuse the Jews of fabricating the descriptions of the Holocaust for political and material benefits, in the view of the court the Remer version of the Report had the purpose of suggesting this and thereby arousing hostility toward the Jews. This follows from the fact that the reader, believing the claims of the Report to be correct and influenced by the tendentious comments and rhetoric, would come to the conclusion that the surviving Jews as the most important witnesses of events, su rviving relatives as directly af- fected and Jewish researchers must have intentionally concocted false reports on the Holocaust.” According to the court, then, Remer’s remarks were not punish- able by themselves; only together w ith my report a reader so inclined could ‘read between the lines’ and would supposedly be led to hostility toward the Jews, and that is morally indefensible because it must be clear to everyone that one ought to be ‘a friend of the Jews’. Therefore, not only was I punished for a crime I had not commit- ted, but for one which no one had committed. This would have made some sense, at least, if Remer had foregone his commentary and I had been sentenced for my report and not for somebody else’s commentary, but that was not the case. In Exile On May 7, 1996, the criminal trial against me and others for the publication of the book Grundlagen zur Zeitgeschichte 551 (for this, see chapter 11.4.2.) began before the County Court of Tübingen.

Also, the public prosecutor of Tübingen was an swerable to the General Prosecu- tor’s Office in Stuttgart, and who knows to whom they are answerable. From the beginning, the following dicta overshadowed the trial: “The moral foundation of this Republic is at stake.” 552 “All democracies have a basis, a cornerstone. For France it is 1789, for Germany it is Auschwitz.” 553 In its sentence, the Tübingen County Court decided the book Grundlagen zur Zeitgeschichte should be withdrawn from circulation, effectively annihilated and that th e author and publisher should be pun- ished. This, after prominent German historians had submitted to the court expert opinions to the effect that the book held to scientific stan- dards and that therefore the authors, editor, publisher, sellers, printer and purchasers were owed the right of freedom of science and the right of freedom of expression (see chapter 11.4.2.). 554 It did not help: “The Non-Jew Must Burn!” Since I was the editor of the book, Grundlagen zur Zeitgeschichte , a warrant for my arrest was issued and I fled the country. In view of all this I hope one may forgive and unde rstand my reasons that I took my family and went into exile. A busy young father had better things to do than breathe jail-house air. 555 Hindsight is Insight Today, nine years after these events, I know that it is precisely the serious, scientific revisionist work that the establishment considers threatening, since one cannot fight a professionally written work with cat-calls and jeers. Unlike shallow pamphlets, it must be taken seri- ously. Patrick Bahners stated the establishment view in the highly re- spected German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung : 556 “The state protects the freedom of science. It recognizes the scien-   552 Die Zeit , Dec. 31, 1993, p. 51. 553 German Federal Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer in Süddeutschen Zeitung , acc. to Rheinis- cher Merkur , April 16, 1999. 554 Ref. 4 Ls 15 Js 1535/95. 555 Unfortunately, my wife took my two children and left my in January 1999, initiating divorce proceedings in early 2000. 556 “ Objektive Selbstzerstörung ”, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung , August 15, 1994, p. 21."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 326 tist not by the result, but by correct form. [...] But it can be seen that the intention to agitate can be recognized not only by errors of form that separate beer hall talk from scientific undertaking. On the contrary agi- tation that is perfect in form is the most perfidious. [...] But for those who survived Auschwitz it can hardly be a slighting insult when an expert us- ing phony reasoning tells him ther e never was a mortal danger. Also the state is mocked here. If Deckert’s [a German revisionist] ‘ Views about the Holocaust’ were correct, the Federal Republic was founded on a lie. Every Presidential address, every minute of silence, every history book would be a lie. When he denies the murder of Jews, he repudiates the legitimacy of the Federal Republic.” However, Bahners proceeds from false premises. First, Bahners does not make clear how an intention to agitate can be recognized, if not by errors of form. It is stated in the German con- stitution that science is free without restriction. Decisions of the Ger- man Federal Constitutional Court have stated that science is defined by formal rules alone and not by content. These decisions are in agree- ment with fundamental theoretical works on the nature of scientific knowledge. If Bahners thinks differen tly, he is anti-constitutional, anti- scientific, and anti-human rights. Secondly, there are no experts who assert that the survivors of Auschwitz were “ never in mortal danger ”. Bahners warms up the cal- culated lie that revisionists would present Auschwitz as a vacation re- sort without danger to life or limb and generally characterize the Na- tional Socialist persecution of the Jews as harmless to the Jews. Either Bahners doesn’t know what he’s talking about—in which case he should stay away from the keyboard—or he himself is agitating against others with different opinions, in which case the Frankfurter Allge- meine Zeitung should not allow Bahners to soil its reputation. Thirdly, Bahners’ conception that the legitimacy of the Federal Republic of Germany is based on the unconditional recognition of the established version of the National Socialist persecution and extermi- nation of the Jews is absurd and utte rly false. If the Federal Republic of Germany were actually founded on this historical detail, it would be a dire weakness, because every state th at bases its existence on a version of history enforced under pains and penalties must sooner or later come to grief. Certainly, the formal foundations of the legitimacy of the German Republic are very different—human rights, civil right, acceptance by"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 327 the people of the state, international recognition, political, historical and cultural identity and continuity with preceding German states— and there is no need to accept the harsh judgment of Bahners and some of his colleagues. Pseudo-legal Contortions However, it was recently made clear by the Ministry of Justice of Baden-Württemberg that in future, Germany’s judicial system will adopt Bahners’ viewpoint that revisionist works of a scientific nature constitute incitement to hatred and mu st therefore be burned. In its an- swer to a question relating to the seizure of scientific revisionist books of Grabert Verlag it stated: 557 “Legal intervention is not constitutionally excluded even when it is clear that the case involves a work of science or research. Article 5, Para. 3, Cl. 1 of the Fundamental Law contains no expressed prohibition of limits. In constitutional law it is recognized that even freedoms that are granted without expressed cond itions have limits. Such limits might come from the fundamental rights of third parties or from other constitu- tionally-protected goods. In these cases there must be a comparison of the competing claims of the equally constitutionally-protected interests with the purpose of optimizing these claims. There must be a particular examination of the case making us e of the method of proportionality. (Decisions of the Federal Constituti onal Court (BVerfGE) 67, 213, 228; 77, 240, 253; 81, 278, 292ff.; 83, 130, 143) When these constitutional re- quirements are met, in special cases use of appropriate measures is con- sistent with freedom of science or of research” The assertion of the Minister of Jus tice that even a scientific work can be seized when the fundamental rights of others are involved is completely false, and the decisions of the German Federal Constitu- tional Court cited here are misleading. It is true that no fundamental right can be guaranteed unconditionally and when there is a conflict with other fundamental rights that an optimal compromise of interests must be found by means of the principle of proportionality. However, this limitation of fundamental rights pertaining to the freedom of sci- ence can never extend to the determination of what theses may be stud-   557 Dr. Ulrich Goll, ref. 4104—III/185, Sept. 23, 1996; cf.

Only the means by which research is conducted is subject to limi- tations, since research may not employ methods that compromise the rights of others—such as experime nts on humans or endangering the environment. If it is forbidden to science to formulate new theses or to attempt to refute existing theories, however controversial these at- tempts and their conclusions might be, or if it is forbidden to science to use certain arguments or to come to certain conclusions, or to publish scientific conclusions in order to subject them to indispensable public scrutiny and scientific criticism, then one throws the fundamental right to freedom of scientific research out the window entirely, because the critical examination of standing theories and paradigms through seri- ous attempts to refute them, and the publication thereof, is the heart of science, or even of human knowledge in general. 558 The Consequences The declaration of the Ministry of Justice given above is clearly unconstitutional and one may hope that the German Federal Constitu- tional Court will say so at some point in the case of Grundlagen zur Zeitgeschichte . Of course, it is not likely to do so under present condi- tions, since in a similar case of Federal book-burning in the early 1980s, the German Federal Constitutional Court itself made a state- ment in the sense of the Ministry of Justice’s statement above. 559 Therefore one cannot avoid the conclusion that the present situa- tion in Germany is as follows: 1. With respect to the core of the Holocaust claim—gas chambers, the National Socialist’s intention to annihilate the Jews, and the carrying out such a program—there can be only one predeter- mined conclusion under penalty of law. 2. The most important condition to the free pursuit of science would then be suspended, that which states: Every thesis must be sub- jected to the strictest attempts at refutation and must be refutable in theory and in practice. Neither may any conclusion of scientific research be prescribed nor proscribed (cf. Article 3(3) of German   558 Cf. Karl R.

Flaws of a State Under the Rule of Law Introduction Where politics and the Zeitgeist exert heavy pressure on justice, one must expect that unjust j udgments will be handed down on pur- pose. For this there is no need e ither for a state with a constitution which is openly contrary to the rule of law or a condition similar to civil war. 1 With respect to normal prosecutions of criminals, the legal procedures of nations observing the rule of law and those not observ- ing the rule of law are similar. Only in politically motivated prosecu- tions will it show whether or not judges follow the rule of law, that is, whether they can be forced by trial procedures not to deviate from them. For some time there has b een a discussion as to how far the character of the Federal Republic of Germany as a nation observing the rule of law has been endangered by certain phenomena of the Zeitgeist . One case in particular caused sev ere accusations from many sides of the German society so that the political distortions within the Ger- man legal system have indeed reach ed such a degree that even legal experts are seriously troubled: In 1991, Günter Deckert, then leader of the German nationalistic party NPD (Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands), organized a convention where Fred. A. Leuchter, a U.S. expert for execution technologies, lectured about his technical and chemical research regarding the alleged ‘gas chambers’ of Auschwitz. Deckert translated his speech for the audience into German. He was subsequently prosecuted for this and eventually sentenced to 12 months on probation. Following a huge media-outcry and massive in- tervention of national as well as inte rnational politicians, Deckert was put on trial again—at a different court with different judges—and sen- tenced to two years without probation. His first judge Dr. Rainer Orlet was threatened to be prosecuted for violating the law—his sentence was considered to have been too m ild—but was eventually only forced to retire. 560 Deckert’s publication about this affair, 561 together with   560 See G.

H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 331 other ‘thought’ crimes like writing naughty letters to Jewish represen- tatives and selling prohibited revisionist literature—were prosecuted as well and, together with his first conviction, led to an accumulated prison term of more than five years. Eventually, even his defense law- yer Ludwig Bock was prosecuted and sentenced for too vigorously defending Deckert by asking for permission to introduce revisionist evidence. This was considered crim inal behavior because Bock alleg- edly indicated with this that he identifies himself with revisionist thoughts. 562 In a similar case, the well-know German right-wing de- fense lawyer Jürgen Rieger was put on trial in 2000, because during the proceedings against one of his clients in summer 1996, he had filed a motion to introduce me as an expe rt witness as evidence for the fact that his client’s revisionist claims were well founded. Though Jürgen Rieger was initially acquitted by the Hamburg District Court, 563 the German Federal Supreme Court subse quently overturned this verdict, demanding the sentencing and punishment of every lawyer who dares to ask for, or introduce, evidence challenging the common ‘knowl- edge’ about the Holocaust. 564 Thus, it is clear that every judge, who dares to hand out lenient sentences to revisionist, at least risks an abrupt end of his career, and defense lawyers trying to defend their clients effectively may themselves be prosecuted for that. In what follows, I shall show by my own experience which indi- cates that the rule of law in the Germ an state has many flaws that make it easy for the judicial system in general and the judges in particular to deliberately make bad decisions uncorrectable, because they have the appearance of being decided according to the rule of law. Again and again in various sorts of company I encounter the same disbelieving astonishment as to the stat e of the German criminal justice system that overcame me at the beginning of the prosecution avalanche   heim 1995 (District Court Mannheim, ref.

As a conse- quence of his prosecution, Bock subsequently changed his defense strategy, and when as- signed to defend the Australian revisionist Dr . Fredrick Töben in November 1999, he re- mained completely silent in order to prevent further prosecutions, hence rendering any defense of Dr. Töben impossible. 563 Hamburger Morgenpost , Nov. 14, 2000; see “ Verteidiger Rieger siegt in Verfahren wegen ‘unzulässiger Verteidigung’”, VffG 4(3&4) (2000), p. 457 (online: www.vho.org/News/D/N ews3_00.html#n7) 564 German Federal Supreme Court , BGH, ref. 5 StR 485/01; see German daily press from April 11, 2002 ( taz , Bild , Frankfurter Rundschau , Stuttgarter Zeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zei- tung , all on page 2!)."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 332 against me. Despite my lack of lega l qualification I believe I have been called upon to raise my voice on this subject, since the numerous for- mal defects of the German legal system have apparently not been dealt with by those with the professional competence to do so. Since I am no legal expert but only one who has been self- educated on the subject through painful experience, I hope readers will excuse my ineptness of expression. If I make frequent reference here to my trial before the District Court of Stuttgart (ref. 17 KLs 83/94), it is because these examples serve to indi cate major problems in the Ger- man system of government and its judicial system. No Word-For-Word Record Until the end 70s, a record of the proceedings was kept during German criminal trials, in which the statements of witnesses and re- sponses of the accused were set down. Th e contents of this record were never relevant for an appeal or revision. For example, if in the record it said ‘The witness said A’, but in the decision the court stated ‘The wit- ness said B’, the assertion in the decision would be taken as the fact and that in the record would be considered meaningless. In the course of a change in the German criminal law at the end of the 70s, the duty to make entries in the record of the proceedings was removed for reasons of economy for all courts higher than the County Courts. What appears now in German trial records is something like ‘The witness made statements on the subject’ or ‘The accused made a declaration’. The substance of what was said cannot be found there and it can no longer be proven by documentation when the court uses statements incorrectly. 565 In other nations observing the rule of law, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, or Austria, word-by-word transcripts of the   565 There is always the possibility that the defens e can hire its own stenographer to record the proceedings and type them up later. Then there w ould have to be a motion to insert this record into the record of the proceedings. Motions of this sort ar e always denied because the German Code of Criminal Procedures does not provide an y rules for such records. In order to defeat the usual refusal of the court to accept such a motion on the grounds that the transcript is fac- tually incorrect, the motion would have to be ma de either before the dismissal of the witness or immediately after the response of the accuse d or the defense attorney. Thereby the doubts of the court could be allaye d through requestioning of the w itnesses or the accused. Although the record of the statements can be entered into the record of th e proceedings with the (denied) motion in this way, they will still be irrelevant in appeals and revision procedures. Consider- ing the expense to the accused in time and money of such an effort over the course of, say, a thirty-day trial with twenty witnesses, it shoul d be clear how impractical this scenario is."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 333 proceedings are prepared. The anti-justice consequences of the present German system can easily be imagined, and I will briefly illustrate it with three examples from my own trial. 1. The issue in this trial was whether or not I had participated in the distribution of a version of my expert report with added commen- tary by Generalmajor O.E. Remer in April 1993. The court was inter- ested in, among other things, how Remer had come into possession of that particular version of my re port which he used for producing his printed version. In the trial I had stated that Remer had probably re- ceived it from his attorney Hajo Herrmann. The court was more than eager to nail me as a liar, so they were trying to make Hajo Herrmann concede that he never sent a copy of this particular version to his cli- ent. Remer had reproduced the “ second version of the 3rd edition ” of my report, which the court called version “ F2 ”. 566 In the trial report made by an observer, the questioning of Herrmann on December 6, 1994, ran somewhat as follows: “Then the witness Hajo Herrmann, year-of-birth 1913, was ques- tioned. He confirmed that in the summer of 1991 he had assigned the preparation of the expert report to the defendant (Germar Rudolf). The witness states that he had received every version of the expert report from the defendant and had sent a copy of each to his client Remer. Later the witness stated that he did not know whether he had received another expert report in November or December 1992. When the judge inquired about it further he said t hat he could almo st exclude this. He also did not believe that he had provided Remer w ith a new version of the expert re- port during the appeal to the Federal Supreme Court. Later, Herrmann said that the first version of the 3rd edition sent in November 1992 was the last that he had received. When the defendant (Germar Rudolf) inter- rogated Herrmann (which the judge at first objected to) whether the wit- ness thought that the arrangement of the chapters of the first version of the 3rd edition was correct, the witness remembered that he had re- quested a change by telephone. At that point the witness decided that he must have received the second version of the 3rd edition that had been changed due to his request [this was the version called “ F2 ” by the court, which Remer used to produce his published version] . Herrmann could also not exclude that Remer might have obtaine d documentation with   566 The first edition was mailed out in some 15 c opies in January 1992, the second in February 1992, the first version of the third edition in N ovember 1992, and a slightly revised version of this edition (second version) in December 1992."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 334 new versions of the expert report during the appeal to the Federal Su- preme Court. He said he had submitted the expert report both during the appeal to the District Court and during the appeal to the Federal Su- preme Court. At this moment, the Presiding Judge interjected that the expert report was not to be found in the records of either of these pro- ceedings. Made aware of the error of hi s statement, the witness said that due to the voluminous material in the numerous trials in which he was involved he was not able to pay such particular attention to any one document, hence he could not rememb er every single one. In the course of time he had been involved in 12 to 15 trials in which he used Rudolf’s expert report, in addition to all his other trials. For him, the witness, the expert report of the accused was just one document among many others and so he was not able to remember details.” What can be seen from this is th at the witness Herrmann was basi- cally confused and could not rememb er details about which version he had sent to whom and when. But at least Herrmann remembered clearly that he had requested changes to the expert report, so he con- cluded logically that I must have sent him copies of this rearranged version; after all, I had prepared th is version on his request. The court, however, described the statements of the witness on page 199 as fol- lows: “The taking of evidence has shown on the other hand that attorney Herrmann never, and in any case not during 1992 nor in the first quarter of 1993, had come into possession of draft ‘F2’ and that he did not send it to Remer. The witness Herrmann affir med that the draft ‘F1’ was the last version of the ‘expert report’ that had come to him, and in addition he could not say when he came into possession of this version. In the rest, he believably reported that he had had no further contact with Remer after the trial in Schweinfurt on Oct. 22, 1992, due to the ‘expert report’. He could not remember having sent a copy of the ‘expert report’ to Remer in December 1992.” The difference between the two te xts is obvious: The independent observer reported that Herrmann did revise his initial statement after I made him remember that it was Herrmann himself who made me pre- pare this particular version “ F2 ”, which leads to the logical conclusion that he did, of course, receive at l east one copy of this version he had specifically demanded. But the court simply ‘forgot’ about this detail. From its own faulty reasoning, th e court concluded on page 202f.: “The fact that the accused knowingly spread an untrue account of"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 335 how the Remer operation came about is a particularly clear indication that he was involved in the Remer operation.” 2. The Court was also eager to try to prove that I did tell my sister about Remer’s commentary before Remer had even started to distrib- ute my report, which would have been possible only if I had been in- volved in the production of said commentary. The first copies of my report mailed out by Remer arrived at their destinations briefly after Easter 1993. Did I tell my sister already before Easter about these comments, then this would put a ‘n ail into my coffin’. According to the above-mentioned independent observer, the sister of the accused made the following statement on January 24, 1995: “The sister of the accused states that she learned from her brother during a visit shortly before East er 1993 (April 10-12, 1993), that Remer had joined a racist and anti-Semitic commentary to the expert report, which he had obtained from his attorney, and distributed it against his will. In this connection there was talk [between my sister and me] of a measure against Remer at one time. Th e inquiry, whether her brother de- scribed the Remer operation as a th reatening event or as a completed happening, she could not answer because she could not remember. It was possible that the operation had already happened. Actually she had spo- ken with her brother on this subject numerous times since there had been telephone communications between them once a fortnight. Under inten- sive questioning by the court about de tails of content and chronology of the events at that time, the w itness appeared stressed and appreciably abashed. On inquiry of her brother she said she could no longer remem- ber exactly when she had heard what news from her brother on this sub- ject. She could only describe her overall impression.” The court described this witn ess statement as follows (p. 210): “Moreover the sister of the accused said he had expressed to her al- ready in Easter 1993 (April 11/12, 1993) the intention to follow the Remer version with an ‘authorized’ version. The reason he had given was that Remer had scattered racist expressions through the ‘expert re- port’. But in his testimony the accused says he saw the Remer version first from his doctoral supervisor on 16th April 1993 and first knew of the Remer additions at that time. The fact that he referred to Remer’s ‘racist expressions’ previous to this is a further indication that the ac- cused had knowledge of the Remer operation beforehand.” However, according to the independent observer, my sister thought “ it was possible ” that Remer’s mailout had already taken place"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 336 before Easter 1993, which is clearly incorrect—all copies of Remer’s version were mailed to their recipients only after April 15, 1993. This proves that my sister’s memory was wrong regarding the chronology, which is also supported by her own statements under intensive inquiry both by the judges and by me that she simply could not remember when she had heard what from me. The fact that the witness could no longer remember the exact chronology was duly omitted by the court for obvious reasons. Who of us can remember, down to the exact day, what we heard from our siblings two years ago? But for the court, this was a major stepping stone to its verdict. 3. Another way to prove me a liar was the court’s attempt to prove that my statements regarding contacts with the Remer couple were a lie. By showing that I was hiding my contacts to Remers, they sought to prove that I was in fact involved in their plot to hide the truth from the court. On my contacts with O.E. Remer, the independent observer wrote the following on the trial day November 11, 1994: “At that point he [the accused] mentioned among other things his four meetings with O. E. Remer, of which the last took place at the be- ginning of May 1993. At this time, he had negotiated a declaration of in- junction with Remer through an intermediary. The intermediary had re- phrased it and given it to him, the accused. Shortly thereafter, Remer had signed it in the presence of the intermediary and himself. When asked, why he had not handled the declaration of injunction himself, the ac- cused explained he had not had any c ontact with Remer and did not de- sire to do so.” For January 24, 1995, one reads there: “Next was introduced an application form to participate at a revi- sionist gathering in Roding in summer 1991, organized by O. E. Remer, which had been filled out by the accu sed but not sent in. The accused said he had been interested in th e proceedings because of the announced participants Prof. R. Faurisson and Dr. W. Stäglich. In any case, he was not there, which is also proved by the fact that he had not sent in the ap- plication form. He had not noticed at the time that Remer directed the proceedings.

The copy of the filled out applica- tion form that was found at his house shows that. The accused has not contested this. [...] In addition, he finally admitted to have stopped by Remer’s place in Bad Kissingen on May 2, 1993, together with Philipp in connection with the completion of the declaration of injunction (p. 124). The accused at first attempted to disguise this contact. In his first response during the trial, when talking about how this declaration evolved, he said he had communicated with Remer ‘through an intermediary’ after the latter had not responded to his written warnings. This intermediary had worked out the text of the declaration with Remer and had given it to him. As reason for having made use of an intermediary he said he did not want to have direct contact with Remer. The accused attempted to deliberately misrepresent his attitude to Remer in other cases as well. The above-mentioned letter of the accused to attorney Herrmann on Dec. 20, 1993, shows this. [...] At the same time the accused described [in this letter] the supposedly only three meetings with Remer.

As far as I know, Remer was not involved in the actual pro- duction of the brochure, and I wa s never involved in its distribution. Therefore, no link ever existed between my writing the brochure—without any intention to do it for Remer—and the fact that Philipp put Remer’s name on it (probably even without Remer knowing it) after I had finished my writings. True, I never complained about it, but there was, realistically seen, no other way than Philipp’s way to have this brochure published swiftly—which was necessary since it was a reaction to a series of articles in a weekly newspaper—, and I did not intend to reveal my pen names to anybody anyway, so why bother? It should be mentioned in this context that this brochure still causes me some trouble in that my use of four pen names for it (Dipl.-Ing. Hans Karl Westphal, engineer; Dr. Werner Kret- schmer, barrister, Dr. Christian Konrad, historian, Dr.Dr. Rainer Scholz, chemist and pharma- cologist), all of them pretending to have a di fferent academic degree, led to the accusation of dishonesty and attempted confidence trickery (see, e.g. , www.holocaust- history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/not-the-scien ce/). The background of these pen names was not the attempt to impress people with phony doc torates, though I must admit that it can have this effect. I therefore wish to set the record straight by repea ting what I stated already else- where (www.vho.org/GB/c/GR/ CharacterAssassins.html): The first revisionist publication I was i nvolved in was a brochure with the title Die Zeit lügt! , published in October 1992. It was a reply to tw o lengthy articles of a certain Till Bastian pub- lished in summer 1991 in the German weekly Die Zeit (no. 39, Sept. 18, 1992, p. 104, and no. 40, Sept. 25, 1992, p. 90). This brochure is the fairest writing a bout the Holocaust controversy that ever appeared, simply for the reason th at both articles of Bastian were reprinted in their entirety , and discussed afterwards. The reader alwa ys has the means to check both points of view. Nobody else has ever done that before or since—on either side of this discussion. Nowhere in that brochure is reference made to the special expertise and qualifications of the authors given—simply because these names we re added after the brochure was written—nor would the claims and arguments brought forward in this brochure require the qualifications of these experts. Though it was certainly incorrect to do this, I would like to explain why it was done, as it was certainly not done in order to clai m qualifications that are actually not present. Let me therefore be a bit more detailed. In spring and summer 1992, I was called by severa l defense lawyers as an expert witness in several trials imposed on revisionists in Germ any (Udo Walendy, District Court Bielefeld, February 1992; Gerd Honsik, Upper District Court Munich, March 1992; David Irving, County Court Munich, May 1992; Detscher, County Court Munich, July 1992; Max Wahl, District Court Munich, July 1992). In these trials—as in all trials against revisionists—the judges rejected any evidence presented by the de fense, including all expert witnesses. In one case, I had to learn that a chemist (me) was rej ected because he was neither a toxicologist nor a historian, an engineer (Leuchter) was rejected because he was neither a chemist nor a histo- rian, and a historian (Prof. Haverbeck) was rej ected because he was neither a chemist nor an engineer. My conclusions were that one obviously had to be at the same time an engineer, a chemist, a toxicologist, a historian and perhaps even a barrister to be accepted as an expert witness at a German court of law. The legal pr ocess being so perverted in Germany, I decided to mock it with a parody by inventing a person with all these features , but then Karl Philipp"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 339 by the Court I was always writing and speaking about actual dealings with Remer—there was none in connection with the brochure Die Zeit lügt! —it must be asked: who lacks credibility here? A large number of similar cases could be shown in which the court made observations on the statements of mine or of witnesses that differ from the trial report. Since the differing interpretation of the court were always disadvantageous for me, the question must be raised whether we are supposed to believe that th ese errors were made unintentionally. Hiding the Purpose of Evidence It appears possible that in German courts, the written judgment will suddenly present evidence as the main proof of guilt which had remained in the background during the proceedings of the trial, in that the court reinterprets it in a way that had not been mentioned during the proceedings. In this way, it is im possible for the defense to bring in evidence to refute eviden ce which at first appears to be harmless since no one can tell what evidence the court will use as proof of what fact. When the defense attorney wants to introduce a piece of evidence, he must always provide a reason for it so that the court can decide on the request. On the other hand, this rule does not seem to apply to the court itself. Here is one example of that. The court interpreted certain publica- tion details of the original version of the Rudolf expert report used by Remer in his version as well as of the version without comments pub- lished by me a few months later as proof that Remer’s distribution ac- tivities of his version and the subsequent publication of my authorized version were one single operation pla nned in advance. As one of the main proofs for this the court pointed to the fact that in the draft of my expert report produced in November 1992 (version F2), Prof. R. Fau- risson had not been mentioned in the acknowledgements at the end of the report. He had first been expressly thanked in the authorized ver- sion of my expert report published in July 1993 on the inner cover. According to the Court, this allege dly proves that the authorized ver- sion was planned already in November 1992 (decision, pp. 93, 208ff.   and I realized that this would be a bit unrealistic , so we split that person into many. That is the background. I think it is both tragic—for the vi ctims of those German kangaroo trials—as well as funny—for the neutral observer to see the desp erate attempts of German judges to keep any evidence out—, but the reader does, of cour se, not have to agree with me on that."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 340 Don’t try to find logic in it. There is none.). It did not enter the judges’ minds that I had deleted the acknow ledgement to Faurisson from the November 1992 version simply because I feared to be rejected as an expert witness, should any court recognize that I had been in contact and on good terms with the world’s leading revisionist, and not be- cause I already planned to thank Faurisson later in a prominent place in the authorized version. The whole argument spun around this point about the acknowledgement, which first surfaced in the decision and was based on different versions of th e expert report that had been in- troduced as evidence, had never been mentioned even peripherally in the 29 days of the trial proceedings, so that the defense was unable to bring in any evidence to counter this supposed evidence proving the guilt of the accused. Introduction of Evidence After the Verbal Decision It is doubtful whether the introduction of evidence following the trial is admissible. Nevertheless, the District Court of Stuttgart used exactly this method in order to portray me as untrustworthy. As sup- posed proof that I had manipulated witnesses, on page 170f. of its deci- sion the court stated: “Further, during a search of his living quarters on March 27, 1995, which took place in the context of an investigation conducted by the State Attorney of Tübingen on the book “Grundlagen zur Zeitgeschichte”, an- other computer belonging to the accused was found on which there was an answer list that concerned the interrogation of the witness Dill by the court, as the accused himself declared in the trial.” First, the description of the court is misleading, since I had only declared that my computer had been seized, but not that an answer list had been found on it. This document had been mentioned by the court in the trial but it had not been intr oduced as evidence in the trial. For this reason, the defense attorney did not think it necessary to produce evidence to oppose this imputation, which might have explained that the item was not an answer list intended for use in an upcoming ques- tioning of a witness. In fact, it was a detailed record I had prepared about what Dill was asked and what he answered when he appeared for the first time in front of the court, and this list was prepared after this interrogation, hence could not be used to manipulate this witness at all."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 341 Refusal of Foreign Witnesses Without Reason In the middle of the 1980s, the German criminal justice system was altered so that motions could effectively be denied to hear the tes- timony of foreign witnesses in their own country. In the course of the trial concerning Remer’s distribution of my report, it became obvious that several foreign revisionists had participated in the operation indi- rectly or directly. Since these revisionists faced the possibility of arrest if they traveled to Germany, due to their revisionist activity, they would have had to give their testimony outside the country. Because of the reformulation of the German la w, however, it was possible for the court in the final phase of the trial to deny numerous motions of the defense that were intended to hear the testimony of foreign witnesses outside the country on key questions. The effect this can have on the judgment is obvious. Prevention of Appeal In criminal proceedings caused by crimes that are considered by the German authorities to have caused major violations of law and or- der, the trial is held immediately on the District Court level, i.e. , on what normally is supposed to be the a ppeal level (the first level is the County Court). In such cases, the accused has only one trial during which evidence can be presented, that is, there is no appeal possible to the verdict of this court! Only a so -called application for a revision of the verdict with the German Federal Supreme Court is possible, but such an application can only criticize errors of form (matters of law). The factual assertions of the deciding court, i.e. , description and evaluation of evidence (matters of fact), will not be discussed anymore. Furthermore, it is usually the case that applications for a revision will be denied by the German Federal Supreme Court, if the defense is the only party to request it. Whoever determines, and on whatever basis, whether or not law and order have been seriously violated by an offender, must remain open. But such a serious violation seems to be always given, if the of- fence massively attacked political taboos. In such cases—where the accused’s entire existence is at st ake—he has no possibility of reopen- ing the taking of evidence in an appeal.

The Arbitrary Evaluation of Evidence Even if a court has introduced evid ence in the course of a trial that made its delicately constructed bri dge of circumstantial evidence to collapse by refuting it, this is no reason not to impose a sentence. Here is an example. In my case, the court had come up with the idea that, already in October 1992, I had planned Remer’s distribution activities of his ver- sion and the subsequent publication of my authorized version as one single operation planned in advance (decision pp. 207ff.). At the same time, on Feb. 16, 1995, the court introduced a letter of mine to Mark Weber, dated May 22, 1993, from which it was clear that up to the end of May 1993, a month after the end of Remer’s distribution operation, I still did not know where I could publish my authorized ver- sion of the expert report, which indi sputably contradicted the court’s thesis that I was already planning to publish the authorized version at the same time as I was allegedly helping to plan the Remer operation. Here is a discussion of a second example of the court’s logic-free evaluation of the evidence. In its written verdict, the court conceded that I intended to get the attention of the lay public for my expert report (decision pp. 23f., 108f., 210), so that I had paid attention that there was no reason for the general public to suspect any lack of technical merit and reputation, e.g. , by including political comments (decision pp. 17ff., 196f., 218). This was supported by the evidence as a whole and in particular by the documents introduced on June 13, 1995, which was a series of letters that I wrot e to various persons between 1991 and 1993, all clearly stating that I did not want any political or polemic comments included in or associated with my expert report. However, if one was to follow this logic, one has to assume that I would have sent out—or agreed to the distribution of—a version of my expert report which confined itself to technical discussion but would never have sent out one such as the Remer version with its polemical/political com- mentary. In the decision the court can escape this logical contradiction only by claiming that I had miscalculated the effect of Remer’s commentary (p. 228)."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"11.

The ac- cused acted on the basis of a calculated and highly refined strategy car- ried out in a hidden manner that was chosen beforehand with great de- liberation, involved numerous deceits and manipulations and was there- fore very difficult to penetrate.” (decision p. 237) Which leads to the Court’s conclusion: “The sentence of imprisonment is not subject to probation, by sec. 56 of the Criminal Code (StGB).” (decision p. 238) since: “On the contrary, [the crime of the accused] as described, because of the calculated and refined and clandestine manner in which it was carried out, should be seen as particularly grave.” (decision p. 240) Conclusions Given the present circumstances of th e criminal justice system in the Federal Republic of Germany, when a judge or a panel of judges intend to render an unjust verdict, they will have no difficulty in doing so as long as they are assured there is no organized public resistance from the media, academia, the police, or the churches. The statements of witnesses and accused may be manipulated at will. Evidence may be interpreted any which way in the decision or may be brought in after the process is over. Submitted evidence may be passed over without mention and use of foreign witnesses may be denied arbitrarily. Exculpatory evidence may be di scredited as a deceptive maneuver of the accused and serve as evidence that the accused is particularly deserving of punishment.

Closing Remarks The court based its refusal to a llow for a probation of the sentence of imprisonment not only on my supposedly high “ criminal energy ,” but also on the fact that I did not seem to have a favorable social prog- nosis, since I had not only not repudiated my revisionist views, but defended them even more vehemen tly and kept propagandizing them. As proof for this the court pointed to the book Grundlagen zur Zeit- geschichte , 570 edited by me under a pen name, which had come onto the market just at the beginning of this trial, as well as to the almost- complete book Auschwitz: Nackte Fakten 571 found on my computer during a house search conducted in March 1995, i.e. , right in the mid- dle of the ongoing proceedings. With this, a fact was used to harden my punishment that had not even been determined to be a crim inal offense in a legally binding de- cision by a German court in the first place, as was a work which had not yet been published and which therefore could not even theoreti- cally have been a crime. By German law, it is admissible for a German criminal court to take account of the opinions of the accused—here my historical revisionist opinions—in the weighing of punishment. Through this back-door, the trial agai nst me was turned into a political trial. 572   570 E. Gauss (ed.), Grundlagen zur Zeitgeschichte , op. cit.

The First Crime: Remer’s Commentary Reprinted below is the commentary of retired Major General Otto Ernst Remer, which he included in his version of the Rudolf expert report, as it was printed on pages 109a to 114 of the court decision against Germar Rudolf. 573 After reading this chapter 11 so far, readers should be in a position to judge whether this commentary was suffi- cient cause to sentence expert witness Germar Rudolf to 14 months’ loss of freedom, had he been the author of the commentary, which he was not, though the Great State Security Chamber of the District Court of Stuttgart disregarded the evidence and said he was the author. On Jan. 19, 1996, the German Attorney General demanded that Germar Rudolf should spend 14 mont hs behind bars for nothing other than this commentary. The German Federal Supreme Court concurred with this demand in a decision on March 7, 1996 (ref.: 1 StR 18/96). In addition to these judicial issues, there were other problems with Remer’s commentary. In his preface printed on the inside front cover, under the caption “ To all friends, countrymen ... ” he attacked our lead- ing politicians, media people and jurists harshly with the words, “ These liars need to be driven from their spoils fortresses ”. At the same time, Remer mailed this version to exactly these leading politi- cians, media people and jurists. It is certain that to send such a piece of writing to these leading politicians, media people and jurists was en- tirely useless—though it must have cost many thousand DM. Remer attached a comprehensive five-page article on the October 1992 trial, in which Remer himself had been sentenced to a 22 months prison term for denying the Holocaust and other things. This article was written by a close friend of Reme r who had attended Remer’s trial. It basically summarizes the major even ts of this trials, like a descrip- tion of various pieces of evidence presented by the two defense law- yers, their rejection by the court, and the final pleadings of the public prosecutor and Remer’s defence attorneys.

In the trial against expert witness Rudolf, the District Court of Stuttgart took exception against this article, which had been entitled “ Justice in Germany 1992 ”. For example, they criticized that the quo- tation from the Foreign Office saying that it was known that there were no gas chambers in Auschwitz (p . I) was incomplete, as the ellipses showed. The quoted German official Dr. Scheel had stated later in his letter that the gas chambers had b een located in the Birkenau camp which was 3 km to the west. Thus he had not denied the existence of gas chambers in the complex Auschwitz-Birkenau, as the quotation suggested, but only with respect the main camp Auschwitz. This de- termination of the court is correct and demonstrates that Remer’s friend misconstrued documents to mislead the public. However, it should be pointed out that the statement of the Foreign Office that there had been no gas chambers in Auschwitz contradicts many wit- nesses, such as Pery S. Broad or Rudolf Höß. If these witnesses were wrong with their statements about the main camp Auschwitz, how can we be certain that other witnesses to other camps were not just as wrong? How can it be that under such circumstances to doubt the exis- tence of gas chambers in other camps , or even to dispute their exis- tence, is a criminal offense? The District Court of Stuttgart also commented that the “ Compari- son of official figures on the number of those killed in the gas cham- bers in Auschwitz ” (p. II) was insulting and constituted incitement to racial hatred. But in the meantime, quite official and well reputed sources have added even lower figures to this list of massively differ- ing numbers: in 1993 and 1994, the French pharmacist Jean-Claude Pressac claims between 630,000 and 470,000 ‘gas chamber’ victims, and in 2002, a German mainstream journalist reduced the death toll of the Auschwitz ‘gas chambers’ down to as little as 356,000. 574 One could certainly agree to the view that any number of victims which is too high or too low can have an insulting effect on some people or can incite to hatred against others. Ho wever, it was not Remer who had put these widely differing figures into the world, among which only one can be correct at best—and all others potentially inciting to racial ha- tred. Also, Remer’s statement that the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial had de-   574 See notes 458-460."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 347 termined that there were only 45,510 deaths in the gas chambers was not strictly true. In 1965, the Frankfurt Jury Court had sentenced some of the former camp staff on grounds of murder of a certain number of people by poison gas, and for othe r reasons. All told, it repaid 45,510 gas chamber murders in that it found some defendants guilty of having killed or contributed to the murder of a certain number of inmates. As to the question, how many prisoners had been killed by poison gas in Auschwitz all in all, the court ha d given no answer and did not have the duty to do so. The determination of the total count of victims is properly a scientific question. That having been said, this would also mean that the Stuttgart Court did not have the duty nor the competence either to make a judgment about the total death toll of Auschwitz, that is, it should not have criticized othe rs for asking questions and having different views in this regard. It remains true that German justice has judicially determined a figure of 45,510 gas chamber deaths, no more, no less, and that any- thing more is a scientific question and not a question of criminal jus- tice. It must be asked then, why one should proceed against people with threats of criminal penalty and use of the magic formula ‘common knowledge,’ who do nothing else but to assert that counts of victims as high as several hundred thousand or even several millions are greatly exaggerated, particularly since several well-known mainstream authors do make similar statements. Only that can be judicially claimed to be ‘common knowledge’ which has been de termined to be so in court on examination of evidence. With respect to the number of victims of the gas chambers of Auschwitz, that has not been done. In the written basis for the decision, as proof of their assertion that the epilogue of the Remer version had deliberately created the impres- sion that the Holocaust was used by Jews to exploit Germany, the Court gave this one example (decision, p. 235): “This applies especially to the reprinting of a letter claimed to have been written by a Jew on May 2, 1991 (p. IV of the epilogue, p. 113 above). Together with the assertion that the Holocaust was an invention of the Jews, this deliberately inflames hatred against the Jews.” In the epilogue in a display box one sees that Remer has quoted a letter with a sender’s address in Israel, in which the writer inquires about financial reparations based on the claim that his uncle was alleg- edly gassed in the concentration cam p at Dachau. That this letter was"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 348 written by a Jew is not mentioned anywhere, nor is there any reference to the religious affiliation of this pe rson in this article. There is also no assertion in Remer’s (or his friend’s) comments “ that the Holocaust was an invention of the Jews ,” quite contrary to what the court claims. All that Remer’s friend did was to juxtapose the letter from Israel with a letter from the City of Dachau, in which the latter clarifies that there had never been any homicidal gassings in the concentration camp at Dachau. The court had not examined whether or not this letter existed, therefore, on the principle “ In dubio pro reo ,” it had to assume that it did exist. In fact, not just Remer but also many other activists had pho- tocopies of the letter which Remer’ s friend had reproduced in the ap- pendix to Remer’s version. It is a fact that there is a large number of statements from witnesses attesting to homicidal gassing in Dachau, but it is also well known that both the official Dachau Concentration Camp Museum as well as the City of Dachau clearly state that there were never any homicidal gassings of humans in this concentration camp. 575 These well-recognized facts were given with the documents pub- lished or quoted by Remer (or his friend), which cannot be a crime. In his commentary on this letter, Remer points out that false witness statements like the one quoted here, attesting to his uncle’s death in a Dachau gas chamber, serve as a basis for ‘common knowledge’ in Germany. Nowhere did he make the claim that anybody had lied for purposes of material enrichment. It is the court that is to blame for the charge that the reader would get the impression from these two repro- duced documents, Remer wanted to impute, Jews had invented a lie for the purpose of exploiting Germany. That even Jews sometimes make false statements about the period between 1945 and 1993 cannot be disputed . This was particularly clear in the criminal trial of John Demjanjuk in Jerusalem. The trial ended with an acquittal for the accused, sin ce even the Israeli court could not shut its eyes to the flood of false documents and false witness testi- mony. 576 Fortunately, in this case also, Jewish personalities turned   575 There are, of course, other sources cont radicting this, see Reinhold Schwertfeger, “ Gab es Gaskammern im Altreich? ”, VffG , 5(4) (2001), pp. 446-449 (online: www.vho.org/VffG/ 2001/4/Schwertfeg er446-449.html). 576 Cf. the summarizing article of Arnulf Neumaier, op. cit.

In addition, the advertising blitz of the Jews Aze Brauner and his friends on May 6, 1995, in th e German daily newspapers Frankfurt Allgemeine Zeitung and Süddeutschen Zeitung , which rehashed the old lies about soap made of the fat of Jews and lampshades made of human skin which have been repudiated ev en by the Holocaust Institute Yad- Vashem of Jerusalem, 578 did not serve to make our jurists consider that not everything a Jew says about the years from 1933 to 1945 is neces- sarily true.

This meant the expert witness was not only punished for a crime that he had not committed, but also for one that no one had committed in the first place. The crime was invented by the court—they ignored the facts and fantasized about what may be written between the lines! Even though this was Rudolf’s first conviction, this sentence could, according to the court, not be suspended, (p. 239): “if only because no positive social prognosis can be made for the accused (§56 para. 1. Penal Code), who is to be categorized as a fanati- cal, politically motivated criminal . During and despite of the current trial, the accused did publish more ‘revisionist’ works or prepared them, which once again proves his views. These, too, use the same strategy of apparent objectivity to deny the Holocaust. For example, in fall 1994 the book ‘Grundlagen zur Zeitgeschichte’ [= Dissecting the Holocaust , Au- gust 2000] appeared, and the book against Pressac was prepared. The Court has therefore no doubt that, in regard of the laws mentioned, the accused is not willing to be a law abiding citizen.” (emphasis added) Here the court openly admits that it sentenced Rudolf to a prison term because of his scholarly convi ctions which allegedly render him an incorrigible criminal.

H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 351 not yet finally been declared illegal by any court decision, to justify a prison term without probation. By the time the judges handed down their verdict in June 1995, Rudolf had published three books. About the first, Rudolf’s Expert Report on chemical and technical details of the alleged gas chambers of Auschwitz, the verdict states at page 23: “This work, the basis of his publishing activities, is essentially writ- ten in a scholarly style. It addresses a chemical detail (the problem of hydrocyanic acid) and does not make any general political conclusions.” In general, the verdict says a bout Rudolf’s three main works ( Ex- pert Report , Vorlesungen zur Zeitgeschichte , Grundlagen zur Zeit- geschichte ): “They are characterized by a scholarly attitude with reference to his expertise as a scientifically trained chemist. Tone and form are gen- erally held in a way, as if they were interested only in the matter. Addi- tionally, intensive discussions of details, tables and graphs as well as vo- luminous references to literature ar e meant to give the impression of an unbiased and open-minded scholarship. This is primarily true for the three large publications of the accused” (p. 23 of verdict) About Grundlagen zur Zeitgeschichte —now published in English under Dissecting the Holocaust —the verdict says, it includes “ a maxi- mum appearance of objectivity ” (p. 26), which later was confirmed by two German mainstream historians in expert reports they wrote in sup- port of Rudolf’s scholarly work. Of course, the court had to insert the word “ appearance ”, to cast doubt on the quality of these works, be- cause otherwise it could not possibly have sentenced Rudolf. Considering the contempt and ha te this verdict shows against Germar Rudolf, such words of open endorsement cannot be underesti- mated. Since the court had to adm it that Rudolf’s main works are for- mally scientific and scholarly (form, i.e. , appearance, not content, is the only criterion for scholarly works!), the accused could not possibly have committed any crime by publishing them, since the German con- stitution guarantees the freedom of science without restriction in article 5.3 of the German Basic Law (Germany’s unofficial constitution). So Remer’s additions were used inst ead to tie the rope around Rudolf’s neck. With this finding, the court turned the historical dissident (revi- sionist) Germar Rudolf into a “ thought criminal ”."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 352 It should be pointed out here that in May 2002, Fritjof Meyer, an editor of Germany’s largest, left-wing weekly magazine Der Spiegel , stated in a scholarly article addressing the alleged death toll of Ausch- witz that the evidence indicates only some failed test gassings for the Birkenau crematoria, but no mass murder on a genocidal scale. 581 This sensational statement is close to the claim Rudolf has been making since 1992, i.e. , that “the mass gassings [...] did not take place [as] claimed by witnesses”. Hence, Meyer’s article is nothing short of a partial but timely rehabilitation of Rudolf, and it might take only one or two more revisions of the official historiography of Auschwitz to reach the point where it agrees totally with what Rudolf is stating in his expert report.

The main session of the trial ended in a deadlock. The sen- tence was equivalent to the destruc- tion of an 80-year old man. I was not permitted to defend myself against charges consisting of lies, harass- ment, and attacks on my honor. The court denied me the possibility of defense by means of sec. 186 of the German Penal Code. It refused to put my assertions to the test of ex- amination. My defense attorney had asked the expert witness Rudolf to ap- pear. This expert witness was in the courtroom, his expert report had already been submitted along with other official records. However, the expert witness was not allowed to speak and the expert report was not allowed to be read. The expert report and irrefutable scientific facts were denied by presiding judge Siebenbürger. Earlier, Diplom-Chemist Rudolf had been assigned by my defense attorney, retired Colonel Hajo Herrmann, as expert witness to investi- gate testimony concerning alleged homicidal gassings at Auschwitz. Rudolf used modern scientific, precise measurement techniques to es- tablish the presence of cyanic residue. No physical evidence has ever b een presented in court to support claims of homicidal gassings: no document, no photo, and no orders from military or civil authorities. Can you imagine that a group of peo- ple as large as the population of Munich could be annihilated without leaving any traces of the crime? The only proofs of mass homicidal gassings are absurd witness statemen ts. In the great Frankfurt Ausch- witz trial (50/4 Ks 2/63) the court ‘proved’ the existence of homicidal gas chambers with the testimony of a single eye-witness, named Böck, who reported having seen thousands of Jews killed with Zyklon B.

What is the difference between Böck’s testimony and that of eye-witnesses who confirmed under oath that they saw witches riding brooms on their way to the Blocksberg? In a powerful and irrefutable scie ntific work, my expert witness made a shattering discovery. The buildings in Auschwitz which are pointed out to tourists as homicidal gas chambers, in which millions of Jews were allegedly killed, never came in contact with Zyklon B.

The main point of the expert report Remer had published was: there were no mass kill- ings in Auschwitz with Zyklon B. The court called this publication ‘incitement to racial hatred,’ and Sieben- bürger imposed on General Remer a sentence of 22 months imprisonment without probation. State Attor- ney Baumann demanded a 30 months prison term and moved for the immediate arrest of the 80-year old defendant in the courtroom. Observers of the trial began to suspect that the sentence had been de- cided before the trial began.

As editor of the periodical Remer Depe- sche , the highly-decorated front-line officer had published the results of a number of scientific expert reports. One of them was the Leuchter Report , which former Minister of Justice Engelhard described as “ sci- entific research ”. Fred Leuchter is a constructor of execution gas chambers that use hydrogen cyanide in the USA. Later, the Director of the Auschwitz Museum, Dr. F. Pipe r, assigned the Jan Sehn Institut in Cracow to make a similar expert report. A technical expert report in German in conjunction with the re nowned Institute Fresenius followed in February 1992. The discussion that the General had opened up with his publications was desired even by the Federal President. A letter from the Presidential Office on October 23, 1989, states that von Weizsäcker “ will follow the discussion [on the Leuchter Report ] closely ”. Had the Federal President lured General Remer into a trap with this letter? Remer naturally fe lt that ex-Minister of Justice Engel- hard and the Federal President had encouraged him to publish his facts. Homicidal gas chambers that never came in contact with gas All three expert reports came to the same conclusion: The gas chambers of Auschwitz and Birkenau testified to by witnesses never came in contact with Zyklon B. In legal terms: the weapon was not loaded. For better understanding: When hydrogen cyanide (Zyklon B) comes into contact with concrete or stones, it forms permanent com- pounds with traces of iron in such building material. The compound that develops is blue (hence the German name Blue Acid ( Blausäure ) for hydrogen cyanide, although the gas itself is colorless) and occurs on the surface and within the walls e xposed to gas. Today, one can eas- ily see a massive blue dyeing on both inner and outer walls in the de- lousing buildings. There is no such dyeing in the alleged homicidal gas chambers. Chemical analyses of samples from the delousing buildings show very high concentrations of cyanide, while no traces can be found in samples from the alleged gas chambers. Scientific expert re- ports were never produced for any of the numerous National Socialist trials. No physical proof was ever offered."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 358 In Nuremberg, the propaganda lies of the victors were given reference numbers. Since then they have become ‘facts.’ All courts have continually prevented all gas chamber skeptics from use of any evidence for their sci entific investigations. The courts have taken the point of view that the homicidal gas chambers should be regarded as commonly known ‘facts’. ‘Commonly known’ means that the existence of homicidal gas chambe rs is as certain a fact as that the day has 24 hours. The Nuremberg Military Tribunal introduced the use of ‘common knowledge’ into judicial practice. Pure war horror propa- ganda items from the Second World War were turned into ‘facts’ (IMT-Statutes 19 and 21) which had to be accepted without question by the accused. Defense attorneys who attempted to prove the opposite were threatened with the death pe nalty. The Stalinist massacre at Ka- tyn was one of the charges, as well as homicidal gassings in the former concentration camp Dachau (IMT Document 2430-PS). In Document 3311-PS, the Polish government “ put the victors’ tribunal on notice ” that hundreds of thousands of Jews had been “ steamed ” at Treblinka. Note: “ steamed ”, not ‘gassed’. Today, the Holocausters look down shamefully when they are confronted with this nonsense. In the great National Socialist trial before the Di strict and Chamber Court of Berlin (ref. PKs 3-50) it was determined: “ There were no gas chamber struc- tures in the concentration camp Majdanek ”. But in Schweinfurt, Gen- eral Remer was sentenced to imprisonment because he had published in his Depeschen the court’s determination on the absence of gas chambers in Majdanek. To destroy the German people, only these words are necessary: ‘common knowledge.’ Concerning the alleged gas chambers, no one can speak of the kind of common knowledge such as that which underlies the fact that the day has 24 hours. Only such assertions, as that the day has 24 hours, require no proof. In all other cases there must be proof.

The State Attorney roars This piece of evidence made the State Attorney roar. “ This piece of evidence is an insult to the victims ”, he yelled into the courtroom with a red face. Herrmann replied, “ Then your victims were insulted by the decision in the Auschwitz trial in Frankfurt, Herr State Attorney. Most of what I have just read are ob servations of the court in the great Auschwitz trial in Frankfurt. You can read them in the decision .” At this the State Attorney was speechless. It is peculiar, how a State At- torney can free himself from almost any evidentiary difficulty with only two magical words: ‘common knowledge’. He knew nothing about the decision in the National Soci alist trials and he knew next to nothing about historical connections or physical facts. All a state attor- ney needs in such a case is to be able to pronounce the words, “ denied on account of common knowledge .” The court refused to accept this ev idence. That is, it refused to ac- cept whole passages from the decision in the Auschwitz trial in Frank- furt as well as passages from the writings of ‘survivors’ such as Lang- bein. Naturally, on account of “ common knowledge ”. The English crown: no gassings As part of the evidence he submitted, Dr. Schaller presented the book of Jewish Princeton Professor Arno J. Mayer.

His book British Intelligence in the Second World War can be obtained from the royal stationer’s office. There was a new edition in 1989. On page 673, Hinsley states that from 1942 the English were able to break the coded messages from the German concentration camps. The Eng- lish found that the main cause of death in the camps was illness. Hinsley reports that there were also shootings and hangings. The offi- cial historical scientist of the English royal house states: “ There was no mention of gassings in the decoded messages .” The State Attorney moved that th is evidence, too, be refused on account of ‘common knowledge’. One more time, the court agreed with the State Attorney. At this point, the trial was suspended. It re- sumed on October 22, 1992. Every time General Remer reentered the courtroom after a pause in the proceedings, the public stood respect- fully. Many remained sitting when the court entered, however. An expert witness is kept out The defense surprised the court with an evidence physically pre- sent in the court room, the technical expert Diplom-Chemist G. Rudolf. By the court’s rules of procedure, evidence that is physically present can not be refused, even on account of ‘common knowledge’. The technical expert sat in the courtroom. He had researched the alleged gas chambers in Auschwitz from a physico-chemical point of view. He had taken samples of mortar and had them analyzed by the Institute Fresenius. Also he had conducted hi s own laboratory experiments in which he had gassed masonry with hydrogen cyanide. The expert wit- ness could present scientific proof that the alleged gas chambers never came in contact with Zyklon B. The expert report prepared by the ex- pert witness was submitted to the cour t with the rest of the evidence. The expert witness could also prove that prisoner commandos could not have “ gone into blue clouds of Zyklon B still hovering over the corpses ”, without having been killed themselves. This nonsensical tes- timony on work in the midst of clouds of Zyklon B had been given by Richard Böck, the principal witness in the Auschwitz trial in Frankfurt. Thus Böck was asserting that the commando had been immune to Zyk- lon B. Yet the judge in the Auschwitz trial in Frankfurt believed that he had proved the existence of gas cham bers in Auschwitz with Böck’s"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 362 statement. Böck had witnessed the gassings in two farm-houses which never existed, according to a technical report of HANSA LUFTBILD, which analyzed Allied air-reconnaissance photos. The expert witness could also prove that hydrogen cyanide is a colorless poison. The ex- pert witness was sitting in the courtroom. He could provide clarifica- tion. What did the State Attorney have to say about that? “ I move that the expert witness be refused, since the gas chambers are common knowledge fact ”, was State Attorney’s monotonous re- frain. He demanded that the expert witness be refused without his technical qualifications having been examined. The court agreed with the motion of the State Attorney a nd refused the expert witness, with- out having heard a word he had to say, as “ completely unsuitable evi- dence ”. In addition, the court refused to read the expert report, because of ‘common knowledge.’ No one can see the Auschwitz death-books Attorney Herrmann next submitted a large selection from the offi- cial death books of Auschwitz. In 1989, these death books had been released by the Soviet Union. These official papers documented 66,000 cases of death in minute detail. All of them are under seal at the special effects office in Arolsen. No one is allowed to look at them. A ten country commission, including Israel, prevents any inspection of these documents. Recently, the journalist W. Kempkens succeeded in photo- copying these documents in the Moscow archive. Herrmann submitted a representative sample to the court. The defense attorney moved that Kempkens be allowed to testify. The Holocausters keep talking about how the old and unfit-for-work Jews were sorted out on the ‘ramp’ and ‘gassed’ immediately, so they could not have been entered in the camp register. The death books prove the opposite. Most of the entries were elderly men and most were Jews. The State Attorney moved that the documents should not be admitted as evidence, since th e gas chambers are ‘common knowledge’ fact. The court agreed with the motion of the State Attorney. The State Attorney’s pleading At that point, the taking of evidence was ended and the State At- torney began his pleading. He did not need any evidence, since for him the ‘gas chambers’ are ‘common knowledge.’ He described Remer as"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 363 Mephisto (the devil) for “ denying ” what is “ common knowledge .” For such a “ devil ”, he argued, the abso- lute minimum sentence should be imprisonment for two years and six months. He moved that the impris- onment begin immediately. Defense Attorney Herrmann’s pleading The attorney protested, “ We have submitted evidence in many areas, but the court has never under- taken to examine whether the ac- cused had a valid claim .” Once more Herrmann discussed the denial of evidence in connection with the ‘confession’ of the former camp com- mander of Auschwitz, Rudolf Höß. “ The court had refused to allow the reading of Höß’s torture with the comment that it had not been proven that Höß had made a false confession because of torture. But Höß’s confession is false ”, thundered the retired colonel, a former inspector of Germany’s WWII night fighters, in the courtroom. “ Höß confessed 3 million murdered Jews. Today Holocaust historians say the number killed is 1.5 million ”, he flung at the State Attorney and judge. Then Herrmann read the record of the captu re of Höß. It is described there how the former commandant was thrown on a butcher bench and how his face was smashed for hours. The Jewish sergeant shoved a guide- lamp staff deep in his throat and dumped a whole bottle of whiskey into his victim. His handcuffs were left on for three weeks. “ That’s what you don’t want to hear, Herr State Attorney ”, the defense attor- ney’s words rang out. Then Herrmann read relevant paragraphs from the transfer treaty of the occupying powers. In these paragraphs, Ger- many was forced to recognize forever the historical ‘facts’ that were the basis of the Nuremberg trials. And so German courts still say ‘common knowledge’ to the four m illion Auschwitz lie, to the lie about gassings in Dachau and the lie about “ mass steamings ” in Treb- linka.

H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 365 and that is basically what you are accusing him of .” Herrmann pin- pointed the State Attorney’s error: “ The State Attorney refuses to ac- cept as evidence the decision of the Auschwitz trial in Frankfurt, which counted 45,510 dead .” Herrmann hammered on the conscience of the State Attorney, which does not exist. Then he continued, “ But, accord- ing to the State Attorney, the accused must know that 6 million Jews were gassed .” Herrmann turned to the judge’s bench and shouts: “ The court intends to prove that the de fendant acted with criminal intent, that ‘he knows it.’ ” The public realized that this great man had lived through times where just dealing, dignity, honor, and decency were still common. A trial like the present was very difficult for him. Once again, Herrmann counted the denied pieces of evidence and asked, “ Who in this court- room was not well served by the defense? ” Then he confronted the State Attorney and said, “ The State Attorney will try to convince the accused that he knew that what he said was not true. Herr State Attor- ney, you do not sit in the back of the accused’s head. ” Then the attorney said what he thought was behind the court’s—in many people’s opinion—scandalous handling of the trial: “ I believe that there is another power that hangs over our legal system that gives you your orders. I know that if y ou were to acquit, there would be a great howling—not just here, but mostly in other countries. If you fear this, you should decline to conduct the trial. How can you designate even one piece of evidence as superfluous when the issue is life or death, as it is here? You should recollect that the chief prosecutor at Nuremberg described the victorious powers’ tribunal as a continuation of the war against Germany. One cannot so totally destroy and plun- der a civilized people such as the Germans without an ostensible rea- son or pretext. Auschwitz was that pretext. If ‘common knowledge’ does not endure forever, at what limit of common knowledge do we find ourselves now? Yes, this ‘common knowledge’ will collapse, but will the accused die in his prison cell beforehand? ” With that, Attorney Herrmann ended his pleading. Dr. Schaller’s pleading “ This is a political trial of a very peculiar nature ”, the courageous Viennese attorney threw at the judge and State Attorney. “ For the rea- son that it deals with a crime of opinion, where there was no violence."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 366 The defenders of democracy sit on the accuser’s bench. When a democ- ratic state takes upon itself the power to determine what the truth is, it is no longer a democracy ”, the attorney admonished the State At- torney and court. Dr. Schaller told of a case in Frankfurt of an African drug dealer with a criminal history who stuck a 17 centimeter long knife into the abdomen of a young German be- cause the latter did not want to buy drugs. The attorney quoted the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, as to how the judge in this case would not regard the as- sault as attempted murder or even as attempted manslaughter. She regarded it as a case of the African’s merely wanting to “ teach the German a lesson .” This example of jus- tice in modern day Germany that Dr. Schaller so graphically portrayed is reminiscent of the case of two Turks who stabbed an 18-year old German in Berlin because the latter had blond hair. Both Turks had already been convicted of manslaughter, yet they received probation. For the 80-year old General Reme r who published scientific papers, the State Attorney wants the ‘deat h sentence’. In the waiting room, people passed around articles from large German newspapers relating how foreign murderers, robbers and mankillers are set free because indictments cannot be prepared in time due to ‘shortage of staff’. Every spectator was outraged that there was no shortage of judges to handle the prosecution and indictment of an acknowledged national hero be- cause of his publication of the truth. Dr. Schaller said further: “ To prosecute assertions of fact in th e same way that murderers should be prosecuted—but today no longer are—will lead to social collapse. The state should take care that ar guments are expressed in words. The truth does not need criminal justice. The truth will prevail of its own power” , the attorney scolded the Stat e Attorney. The attorney fur- ther said: “ Doesn’t the State Attorney’s demand for a two and a half year sentence for the publication of scientific knowledge smell of Defense Attorney Dr. Herbert Schaller"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 367 [communist east German] GDR justice? And such a thing for an 80- year old man? Is this Bautzen? [a prison for political prisoners in for- mer communist east Germany]” demanded Dr. Schaller. “ This defense team has introduced a plethora of evi dence that supports the claims of the accused. A plethora of proofs and expert reports that has never been presented to any court of the victorious wartime Allies. And yet, the Allies’ magic words from Nuremberg, ‘common knowledge’ should still apply here? ” Facing the State Attorney, Schaller asked, “ Suppose that we had a new government in Germany and this government were to examine the manner in which y ou servants of the state are proceed- ing, keeping in mind paragraphs 56 and 62 through 65 of the Basic Law. Do you think you would escape harm from the hands of the Ger- man people? ” Then, facing the public: “ Suppose the State Attorney had to justify his charges against the General. Suppose a judge should ask him, what proof do you have of the existence of homicidal gas cham- bers? He would have nothing to show. But as of today, no state attor- ney needs to produce evidence. We ha ve not arrived at that point yet. ” Next he quoted the Jewish revisionist, Rabbi Immanuel Jakobo- vits, who says: “ Today, there is a whole spectrum of business relating to the Holocaust Industry, with authors, researchers, museum curators and politicians .” To the judges’ bench, Dr. Schaller hollered, “ The real threat to public order begins when one demands of the German people that they should assume guilt for gas chamber murders . These are dangerous perversions which construe publication of scientific investigation of alleged gas chambers as defamation and in- citement to racial hatred. How does the State Attorney dispute this sci- entific evidence which the accused has published? He merely tells us that we Germans should and must remain guilty as charged at the Nuremberg trials following World War II. That is all. On the other hand, defense coun sel have an expert witness here in the chamber who has produced an expert report that leaves no ques- tion unanswered. The expert witness has come to the indisputable sci- entific conclusion that the so-called gas chambers never came in con- tact with Zyklon B gas. Never!” Schaller continued, “ There sits the technical expert, who is not al- lowed to say a word. A scientist from the world renowned Max-Planck- Institute is not allowed to testify in a German court! And you want to send General Remer to prison? Are you willing to accept responsibility for that? ”"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 368 Then, raising his voice: “ The accused has the right to expect that the court will fulfill its duty. that is, to inquire into the innocence of the accused. This kowtowing to the victorious Allies of World War II can- not go on forever! ” With the following words tears came to his eyes: “ Why should a man be put to the sword to keep alive this mythology of wartime propaganda? Mr. State Attorney, you should not continue be- lieving novels that become ever more lurid with the passage of time. It cannot go on like this, to leave one’s own people standing out in the cold. Please allow the intr oduction of evidence once more. ” Thus the defense attorney closed his pleading. The General’s closing words “ To this kangaroo court that has denied me the introduction of scientific evidence I have only one thing to say .” General Remer pointed at the state attorney and the judge. “ Germany will one day hold you responsible for what you have done in this courtroom .” Resume General Remer seems to be dangerous to the former victorious powers because he has brought about a discussion of Auschwitz with his scientific publications. If Remer can prove his case, the Allies will lose their justification for having butchered and looted the German people. The Jews will lose, as Prof. Wolffsohn says, “ their only re- maining identity-forming myth .” For these reasons, General Remer is condemned to die in jail. This death sentence is reminiscent of other cases of unsolved deaths such as those of Franz Josef Strauß and his wife Marianne. First Marianne died of unexplained causes in a traffic accident, then the fit, healthy former Minister President of Bavaria passed away under unusual circumstances which are not medically ex- plicable. The Allgemeing Jüdische Wochenzeitung (German Jewish weekly newspaper) of October 29, 1992, recalled Strauß’ goals: “ The declara- tion of Franz J. Strauß on February 1, 1987, that the Federal Republic should come out from under the shadow of the Nazi past and begin a new chapter in the book of history... ” The transfer treaty of the victorious powers forbids Germany to “ come out from under the shadow of the Nazi past and begin a new chapter in the book of history ”.

The Second Crime: A Scientific Anthology German Court Order: Scientific Work Must Burn! Since the 7th of May 1995, Judge Burkhardt Stein of the County Court of Tübingen held court on the fates of the publisher, editor, and some of the authors of the fundamental revisionist work Grundlagen zur Zeitgeschichte (ref. 4 Gs 173/95). 570 First, the proceedings against the authors were separated on various grounds. Next, the trial against the editor Ernst Gauss alias Germar Rudolf was separated since the accused was not present at the proceedings. For that reason, Judge Stein issued an arrest warrant against Rudolf. During the trial, the public attorney and the judge accused the pub- lisher Wigbert Grabert that the incriminated book would meet the test for the crime of inciting to racial hatred in that it used a number of Holocaust denying adjectives such as “ supposed ”, “ presumed ” and “ so-called ”. In order to show that the book had scientific merits, the defense attorney insisted that wh ile reading certain passages from the book, one needed to consult the co mprehensive and detailed footnotes that it contained, which made refe rence mostly to books of establish- ment sources. The judge merely turned toward Susanne Teschner, the public attorney, and answered that the court would not think out loud during the trial. The court denied numerous motions of the defense for recourse to relevant expert reports or for access to court records that might show that the words “ supposed ”, and so forth, did not per se constitute an intentional denying. The court also denied two motions of the defense to suspend the trial on grounds that in this trial there was theoretically no possibility that the judge would acquit the accused, because in such a case the judge himself might encounter social harassment or even criminal re- prisal from the judicial system, as the case of Judge Orlet in the trial"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 370 against the revisionist Günter Deckert had shown. Several days after the beginning of the trial, the expert witness Dr. Joachim Hoffmann was interrogated as to whether the book Grundla- gen zur Zeitgeschichte was scientific. Dr. Hoffmann, for decades a his- torian in the Militärgeschichtliche Forschungsamt (Military History Research Department) of the German Bundeswehr in Freiburg, wrote an expert report on request of the defendant Germar Rudolf (see be- low). During his interrogation, the expert witness stated that terms such as “ presumed ” or “ supposed ” did not please him, yet he did not con- sider that they put the scientific merit of the book in question. The public attorney’s pleading was next. The phrases in the book that offended her most—“ supposed annihilation camp ”, “ Auschwitz bludgeon ”, “ Holocaust religion ”, “ identity-forming group fantasies ”, “ supposed genocide ”, “ established Holocaust scene ”, “ lead ad absur- dum ”—although taken partly from estab lished publications, deny the National Socialist murder of Jews and therefore qualify as incitement to racial hatred. According to th e public attorney, the expert witness Dr. Hoffmann was no more competent to judge whether the book was scientific than a judge or a state attorney is, and his expert report should therefore be disregarded. The publisher Grabert should be sen- tenced to 9 months prison on probation. On the last day of the trial, held on a Saturday(!), 582 June 15, 1996, in his pleading the defense attorney referred to the denunciations of the public attorney, whereby the book was allegedly a pseudoscientific hack-job of the vilest sort, saying that this sort of speech was “ pseudo- legal browbeating ” without content or definition. The defense pointed to the high degree of scientific expertise that had been necessary to produce the book and also to the fact that the expert witness had unre- servedly confirmed the book’s scientific quality. He also pointed out that sec. 130 para. 3 of the German Penal Code (StGB, incitement to racial hatred) was unconstitutional when it served to deliver proven scientific publications up to book-burning. The judge sentenced the publisher Grabert to pay a fine of DM 30,000 ($15,000) and ordered the seizure—in effect, the burning—of all copies of Grundlagen zur Zeitgeschichte as well as all materials needed to produce it. In the written verdict, he stated that although   582 In Germany, courts of law do not hold sessions on Saturdays—with this exeption."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"11.

A Historian’s Expert Report Joachim Hoffmann was born on December 1, 1930, in Königs- berg, East Prussia. Since 1951, he initially studied natural sciences, but later changed to study modern history, eastern European history, and comparative ethnology at the University of Hamburg and the Free University of Berlin. He ended his studies with a PhD degree in 1959/1960. In the same year, he became Academic Director at the Militärgeschichtliche Forschungsamt , the official historical research institute of the German Armed Forces. He stayed in this position until he retired in 1995, more and more specializing on the German-Soviet war of 1941-1945. He has published numerous articles and books and won several cultural awards. Dr. Ho ffmann died in February 2002. The following is the text of his expert report written in defence of Germar Rudolf and his anthology Grundlagen zur Zeitgeschichte ( Dissecting the Holocaust ). 583 Preamble Accredited chemist Germar Rudolf has written me to request an expert statement regarding an anthology titled Grundlagen zur Zeit- geschichte: Ein Handbuch über strittige Fragen des 20. Jahrhunderts (Foundations on Contemporary History. A Handbook of Points at Issue of the 20 th Century), edited by Ernst Gauss and published in 1994 by Grabert-Verlag in Tübingen, German y. The foremost issue was to be the question of the work’s scientific, i.e. , academic nature, rather than the content per se . As a historian specializing in recent and East European history, and on the basis of my decades of professional experience and practice in the academic service of the Federal Republic of Germany, I am qualified and entitled to give an expert opinion on the matter in question.   583 Also published in E. Gauss (ed.), op. cit. (note 22), pp. 561-564."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 372 Regarding my personal qualifications, I wish to state that I was a member of the Militärgeschichtliche Forschungsamt (Military History Research Department) in Freiburg from 1960 to 1995. For almost three decades, my work has fo cused exclusively on matters related to the German-Soviet war. Through the publication of academic books and periodical articles on this topic I am well established as an expert in my field, both at home and abroad. Accredited chemist Rudolf and the co-authors of the anthology at issue are not personally known to me. The Formal Aspect As pointed out in the anthology in question, the book does not of- fer a comprehensive overview of the course of the National Socialist persecution of the Jews during World War Two. Rather, the focus is on specific individual topics regarding disputed and controversial aspects of killings of the Jews. The various contributions to the book are ex- pertly written in a predominantly investigative style. Where detail and completeness are concerned, the body of supporting and documenting references leaves little to be desired and is extremely helpful to a reader seeking further information, not least of all since sources from the opposing subject literature are also cited without reservation. It ap- pears, therefore, that this anthology is part of the large-scale academic dispute over a serious contemporary issue which reaches far beyond its actual academic scope and into the political realm. The individual contributions to this anthology are logically consis- tent and objectively descriptive in structure, even though at times a polemical note does become evident— as is perhaps inevitable in such emotionally charged topics, and as is also quite common in political and historical controversies. In any case, a striving for new understand- ing is tangibly apparent throughout the book. From this perspective, therefore, the anthology cannot be denied an academic character, par- ticularly if one compares it with many a publication from its opposing side, whose academic nature is also never questioned. There is much in the various contributions that strikes one as thoroughly convincing. Much else may be merely noted with objective interest. Elsewhere, doubts and criticisms also come to mind. The issue may perhaps be simplified by pointing out that what we are dealing with in this great controversy is a rather more accusatory style of literature on the one hand, and a rather more apologetic one on the other. This is to suggest"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 373 that in the heat of controversy, both sides may be overly inclined to overshoot the mark and to leave the solid ground of provable facts be- hind. One might perhaps summarize by saying that the time for conclu- sive declarations regarding the great persecution of the Jews has not yet come. The Problem of Self-Evidentness There can be no doubt about the fact that genocide was committed against the Jewish people by the Einsatzgruppen of the Security Police and the SD and by the SS personnel in charge in the concentration camps in the former General Government of Poland. Hitler, Himmler and Dr. Goebbels clearly admitted these misdeeds on several occa- sions. The anthology’s editor, Ernst Gauss, also considers this as given in his chapter. And in fact, the genocide provides an unspoken back- drop for the anthology at issue. To rule out any misunderstanding, it would perhaps have been better to spell these things out unambigu- ously and to clarify that an academic controversy today can no longer dispute the mass killings per se, but rather only the numbers of victims and the methods of murder. In this respect, we admittedly may expect to see far-reaching modifications as yet. In this context as well, the rather overused concept of self-evidentness is in need of limitation, or at least of a more precise definition. Two Important Examples We shall give two especially significant examples of this. 1) From 1945 to 1990, the figure of 4 million victims in Ausch- witz was considered self-evident and was accorded judicial notice in the Federal German courts. But where did this figure come from? It originated with Soviet war propaganda. On March 1, 1945, an official Soviet announcement stated for the first time that “ at least five million people were exterminated ” in Auschwitz. This figure was then reduced to four million in the official Soviet communiqué of May 7, 1945. This number of 4 million victims—put about by Soviet war propaganda, in other words by the NKVD, and in no way proven by any evidence whatsoever—was adopted by the public in western countries, and per- sisted unchanged until 1990, when it was officially reduced to 1.5 mil- lion virtually overnight. Currently the number of Auschwitz victims is set at a remaining 631,000 to 711,000, and a further reduction has not"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 374 been ruled out. 2) To this day the total number of Jewish victims is generally given as 6 million. According to the current opinion of the German experts on contemporary history, this figure was first provided to the Americans by SS Sturmbannführer Dr. Hoettl in spring 1945, and re- peated at the IMT in Nuremberg on November 26, 1945. It must be noted, however, that this selfsame figure was demonstrably first put forth in the foreign press as early as January 4, 1945, several weeks prior to the January 27, 1945 liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp (with its alleged 4 million vi ctims)—put about by none other than the infamous Soviet Minister of Propaganda, Ilya Ehrenburg. Thus it was Ehrenburg who came up with the figure of six million. [cf. Joachim Hoffmann, Stalins Vernichtungskrieg 1941-1945 , 5 th ed., Her- big, Munich 1999, pp. 182ff.; Engl.: Stalin’s War of Extermination 1941-1945 , Theses & Dissertations Press, Capshaw, AL, 2001, pp. 189f.] Regarding Ehrenburg himself, it must be mentioned that in 1941 Stalin had given him the general order to incite a boundless national and racial hatred against all Germans. Ehrenburg’s years-long unbri- dled frenzies of hatred culminated in his call to “ put an end to Ger- many ” and in an effort which he described as “ modest and honorable ”, namely “ to reduce the popula- tion of Germany ”, towards which end the only thing left to decide was whether it would be better “ to kill the Germans with axes or with clubs ”. Both examples show that new evidence can immediately overthrow something that is al- legedly self-evident, and, accord- ingly, it is the duty of any con- temporary historian to call alleg- edly conclusive findings into question. Even in matters involv- ing grave charges, the principle of self-evidentness has been known to become invalidated. As an example one need only Dr. Joachim Hoffmann"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 375 consider the claim (widely accepted in Germany in particular, but now denied by Yad Vashem itself) that the Germans had manufactured soap from the bodies of murdered Jews—a fabrication that also goes back to Soviet war propaganda. Therefore, the anthology at issue here does not commit anything unlawful, but rather engages in a justified and neces- sary pursuit in its attempt to critically examine allegedly self-evident issues on the basis of new evidence or findings, as it is in fact the natu- ral task of historiography to do. The Problem of Eyewitness Testimony Several contributions to this an thology point out, and rightly so, that the testimony of eyewitnesses is unreliable; these contributions back their claims with numerous examples, some of which are indeed truly grotesque. Such experiences certainly agree with those of other historians of the Second World War. This is not to say that eyewitness statements are entirely superfluous, but practical experience definitely has shown that they must always be examined and corroborated with authentic documents. My personal e xperience has been that as early as 1970 eyewitness testimony about details of the events of the war was so unreliable that it would have been a breach of professional duties to base a historical treatise on them alone. Benz’s Anthology On the whole, the contributions to the anthology here at issue fre- quently manifest a profound understanding of the subject and its asso- ciated literature, even though some suggestions made do appear ques- tionable at times. However, the Establishment literature about the Holocaust also often contains factua l errors. One example in this con- text is Benz’s 1991 anthology Dimension des Völkermords , which dis- plays a downright disarming ignorance of the state of affairs on the Soviet side. The authors of the Gauss anthology object, and correctly so, that Benz bases his studies uncritically on the announcements made by Soviet war propaganda and on th e publications about Soviet show trials. The anthology edited by Benz attempts, by means of elaborate statistical minutiae, to prove the correctness of the six-million figure. Anyone who has worked with demographic statistics knows what seri- ous errors can enter into such co mplex analyses even under a strictly objective agenda. Benz is entirely unaware that Ehrenburg had already"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 376 introduced the six-million figure into the annals of war propaganda on January 4, 1945. Thus, he will have to accept the charge that, though unwittingly, he has really only worked to confirm a propaganda figure of Ehrenburg’s. From this perspective, his and his co-authors’ research findings offer a foothold for fundamental criticism. Babi Yar The mass execution of Jewish inhabitants of Kyiv, known as the massacre of Babi Yar, is also subjected to justified and necessary criti- cism in the anthology here at issue. Over time, the actions of Einsatz- kommando 4a of the Security Police and the SD under Blobel have experienced propagandistic inflation to the point where restoring the actual facts to their real dimensions is an obligation for anyone striving for historical veracity. Of course this does not impinge on the fact that thousands of Jews were killed in Kyiv. Overall Impression The overall impression evoked by this anthology edited by Gauss is that its contents must be acknowledged—with critical common sense, of course—no less than is always undisputedly and unrestrict- edly done with the ‘official’ literature about the Holocaust. The princi- ple of audiatur et altera pars [let the other side be heard] must apply in this case as well! A suppression of this carefully documented work would represent a forcible obstruction of the legitimate striving for scientific and academic understanding. The state of knowledge is never static. Experience has shown that exaggerations and errors always grind themselves down in the course of a normal academic contro- versy. One must not deny a mature and free researcher and reader his ability to exercise his critical faculties. It would then be only a small step from suppressing unpopular books, to burning them; and then, though with different motivations, we would be right back where the entire misfortune began. Conclusion As historian officially commissioned by the Militärgeschichtliche Forschungsamt I have spent two-and-a-half decades studying the So- viet military literature about the history of the Red Army and the Sec- ond World War in its original documentary texts—an endless chain of"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 377 misrepresentations, fabrications, distor tions and slander. But even this historical literature turned up the occasional truths. I could not have carried out my academic duties if I had rejected the Soviet publications out-of-hand as being unacademic. The same goes infinitely more for the anthology here at issue, which is on a respectable academic level and which doubtless contributes much to our understanding of aspects of the war, despite any reservations one may have.

Director (retired) [written on September 28, 1995] On June 15, 1996, judge Burkhardt Stein from Tübingen County Court ordered the confiscation and incineration of all books Grundla- gen zur Zeitgeschichte and all means for its manufacturing (Ref. 4 Gs 173/95).

Since I fled my home country in early 1996, many more criminal prosecutions were started for publications I authored, edited, pub- lished, or distributed, and keep authoring, editing, publishing, and dis- tributing. The following list contains cases where such proceedings came to my knowledge. Since distributing literature banned by the German Federal Review Office fo r Youth-Endangering Publications ( Bundesprüfstelle für j ugendgefährdende Schriften ) is a criminal of- fense in Germany, and each confiscation of literature by a German court is accompanied automatically by criminal prosecution against those who authored, edited, published, distributed, printed, imported, exported, stored or otherwise made available the confiscated literature, each of the following cases is considered to be a crime under the tough German thought crime legislation. One must therefore assume that each of the following cases may result in at least one criminal proceed- ing against me. Finally, I have adde d a list of works published by me for which it is unknown if any criminal proceedings were started. Since the content of these publications is comparable to the other publica- tions listed here, it must be expected that in any of these cases criminal investigations have been or will be started."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 378 1.

The Media and the Case of Germar Rudolf The Object of Zeal 606 When in spring 1992 Germar Rudolf sent out the first draft of his “ Expert Report on the Formation and Detectability of Cyanide Com- pounds in the ‘Gas Chambers’ of Auschwitz ” to a narrow circle of re- cipients in science and politics, several historians responded with inter- est. The media, however, received no notice of the existence of the re- port. Only in spring 1993, when retired Major General Otto Ernst Remer took a later draft of the expert report, provided it with a peppery political preface, and then sent some 1,000 to 2,000 copies to the me- dia, public attorneys, politicians, and scientists, did a certain circle of the Establishment learn of the existence of this report. The press was quiet, except for two short articles that appeared on May 8/9 and 13, 1993, in the Wiesbadener Kurier reporting on the em- barrassment the expert report had caused to the chemical analysis Insti- tute Fresenius hired by Rudolf, locat ed in Taunusstein near Wiesbaden, and an announcement in the Märkische Allgemeinen of May 14, 1993, that a certain Prof. L. Bisky had filed a criminal complaint. Finally, in spring 1994, when the Labor Court heard the case between Rudolf and his former employer, the Max-Planck -Institute for Solid State Research at Stuttgart, which ended with a compromise, the dpa (German Press Agency) issued a press release that a ppeared in many newspapers and even on the radio. That prompted the ARD (German Public Broadcast- ing) television program Report to make a witch-hunt broadcast. In the regional press of the Stuttgart area, where Rudolf resided at that time, there appeared mostly factual police notices, reporting that the State Security Department of the Criminal Police of Baden- Württemberg 607 for various reasons had ordered house-searches (Sep-   606 Appeared in Staatsbriefe 2-3/1996, Verlag Castel del Monte, Postfach 14 06 28, 80456 Mu- nich, pp. 23-30. 607 The uninitiated reader may be unaware that in Germany there is a division of the Criminal Police called the State Security Department which prosecutes politically motivated crimes. This department, by far the larg est of the criminal offices, has separate areas for right-wing extremist, left-wing extremist, and foreign-influenced political crimes, respectively. Those employed in one department tend to have a po litical opinion hostile to their target group. For example, those in the right-wing extremist depart ment tend to have left-wing, anti-fascist ori-"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 384 tember 30, 1993, 608 August 18, 1994, 609 and March 27, 1995 610 ). How- ever, the headlines were occasionally ridiculous. For example, the headline “ Nazi book depot in Steinenbronn ” appeared in the Böblinger Boten of March 29, 1995. In fact, there were neither Nazis, Nazi mate- rial nor a book depot in Rudolf’s home. The authorized version of the expert report was published in summer 1993 in Great Britain with the title Das Rudolf Gutachten and has been distributed and so ld in Germany since then. 611 There has been no echo about this version in the media. The media showed increased interest , when the 17th State Security Chamber of the Stuttgart District Court began the criminal investiga- tion against me on account of suspicion of participation in the prepara- tion and distribution of Remer’s commented version of my report. However, they were not interested in the Expert Report nor in me, but merely in the question, whether there should be made an example “ to punish the right-wing ” for reasons of public instruction. The trial proceedings did not center upon the actual contents of my expert report, but on Remer’s politi cal commentary and my (alleged) political views. This was despite th e fact that prosecutions for dissent- ing political views are forbidden according to the German constitution (cf. article 3.3. of the German Basic law). They have a strong tendency to turn into show-trials, and this is exactly what happened in this case. Later on, several of the media reports that were published in the course of the hubbub over the Rudolf expert report and its author at- tempted to critically evaluate how true—or rather how false—this ex- pert report was. On March 28, 1994, the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (MPG, M.-P.- Corporation), umbrella organiza tion of some 200 Max-Planck-Insti- tutes all over Germany and Austria—I had been a PhD student at one   entations. In addition, the German Federal c ourt system includes State Security Chambers whose only work is to punish politically motivated crimes. The prosecutors who work in these courts were politically trained to deal with such crimes. 608 This house search concerned the commented version of my expert report distributed by Remer. 609 This house search was due to suspicion of pa rticipation in the production and distribution of the newsletters Remer Depesche and Deutschland Report .

H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 385 of them—issued a press release on my expert report. They reported on internal measures taken by my former employer, the Max-Planck- Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, against me. The MPG made it clear that since they agreed with the German Federal Constitu- tional Court and the Federal Supreme Court as to the commonly known fact of the Holocaust, they would not involve themselves in the discussion of the issues raised by my expert report. The Expert Opinion of the dpa – Invented from Whole Cloth The news release of the dpa Press Bureau Stuttgart which ap- peared the following day in almost all German newspapers and also on the radio contained the following passage: 612 “According to their spokesman, the Max-Planck-Corporation has no proof that the samples are really from Auschwitz. Even if they are from there, according to expert opinion, it is certainly no wonder that no traces of hydrogen cyanide were found, because cyanide compounds dis- integrate quickly. In earth this takes six to eight weeks and in stone they can only be preserved by “absolut e conservation conditions, including complete exclusion of air and bacteria”. Of course, the Max-Planck-Corporation had no evidence about the origin of the samples, since they did not ask me for any and I had no reason to give them any without having been asked. This is nothing else but a clumsy diversion from the main question. And by the way: if this topic is important to anybody , no one is prevented from verifying the results of my expert report and the test results of others as dis- cussed in chapter 8. On inquiry about the supposed expert opinion about the instability of cyanide compounds, Albert Meinecke, the person at dpa apparently responsible for the notice, referred first to the press statement from the MPG. 613 After it was shown to Meinecke that the statement contained no comment on the factual content of the expert report, nor any com- ment on the stability or presence of cyanide compounds, 612 he made various claims, depending on the caller and the time of the call:   612 Daily newspapers, such as Süddeutsche Zeitung , Stuttgarter Zeitung , Südwestpresse-Verbund (March 29, 1994), taz , Frankfurter Rundschau (March 30, 1994). 613 Telephone conversation of K.

When asked if he had not made a great pile of goat-dung with his press notice, he opined that no one was without fault. 613 f) He would call Rudolf when he knew more about who was respon- sible and what the source was. 613 As of January 2003, this has still not happened. The connection between the MPG and the unnamed expert opinion created by the phraseology of the dpa notice would suggest to the reader that the expert opinion was that of the MPG. The latter declared by fax on April 12, 1994, that this was not the case and that the claim in the dpa notice was mistaken. After two weeks of silence, on April 13, 1994, dpa Editor-in-Chief D. Ebeling of Hamburg, speaking for the agency, announced in a fax message to me that the unnamed expert would remain unnamed to pro- tect his privacy. Two days later, in an unsigned faxed notice, A. Meinecke denied my accusation of falsehood 615 and referred me to the Editor-in-Chief in Hamburg. The Technical Issues Among others, the dpa notice contained the following assertion: “Even if they [the samples] are from there [Auschwitz] , according to expert opinion, it is certainly no wonder that no traces of hydrogen cyanide were found, because cyanide compounds disintegrate quickly.” Evidently the writer of these lines does not know the difference between hydrogen cyanide and cyanide compounds. If he should wish to subsume cyanide compounds under hydrogen cyanide, which might make it easier for the layman to understand, then it is clear: This sen- tence and the following one discu ss the stability of cyanide com-   614 Telephone conversation of G.

H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 387 pounds, the only thing that makes sense with respect to the Rudolf Re- port. The question as to the stability of hydrogen cyanide itself, as raised by Ebeling in his fax to me, is of no concern to anyone 616 —the question is a useless diversion from the subject. The supposed statements of the unknown expert assert that cya- nide compounds disintegrate quickly . This blanket claim is and will always be untenable and shameful for any expert to make. As proof for this, the reader may simply go back to chapter 6.6. of this book, and there in particular to chapter 6.6.5. (page 177). Ebeling’s assertions that stable compounds may form but do not necessarily form 615 needs no confirmation from competent authority, since the fact that every acid in the world forms stable as well as un- stable compounds is as trivial as an ‘Amen’ in church. In the dpa notice it was stated that cyanide compounds will last in stone only under “ absolute conservation conditions ”, but in contrast to that, in the masonry of the cases of in terest here and investigated in detail in this report, the disinfestation chambers of Auschwitz, hydro- gen cyanide formed extremely long-lasting iron cyanide compounds of the Iron Blue type. See the arguments given above for proof of this. Wrong is therefore not only the claim of the dpa press release that this statement stemmed from an expert, but the actual content of this release is absolutely untenable. No expert would have endorsed such a embarrassingly absurd statement. It is not hard to see why the person responsible for having released this ar ticle did not want to be named, as Herr Ebeling said. Report Portrait: Incitement to Hatred One of the main incidents of the witch-hunt against Germar Ru- dolf was the left-wing Report broadcast of the German public TV sta- tion ARD on April 11, 1994. In the footage by Stefan Rocker, every- one from Conservative to neo-Nazi personalities, including Germar Rudolf, were thrown all together into one pot. By this sort of undiffer- entiated reporting, one can produce in certain sectors of the German population a pogrom mood against everything which is or might be right-wing. Report showed pictures of a synagogue in Lübeck which had been fire-bombed just a few months before, using the words, that as soon as Auschwitz denial would boom again, synagogues would be   616 D.

The next picture shown in this footage was that of Germar Rudolf on his way to the Labor Court in Stuttgart. Thereby, Herr Ru- dolf was made into a sort of paper accomplice of the Lübeck arson. This was strengthened by the commentator’s choice of words, when he mentioned the title of the well-known play Biedermann und die Brand- stifter (Everyman and the Arsonist). 617 If that does not constitute criminal incitement of the German tele- vision-viewing audience against Germar Rudolf, what would? It goes without saying that reports of this kind are loaded with pictures of con- centration camps, deported Jews, and a sea of corpses in order to ridi- cule the supposed denial claim of a Germar Rudolf. This is the way the left-wing Report works. But which viewer would know that Rudolf had not only not de- nied, but had actually denounced the frequent injustices that did oc- curred at that time? 618 And who would notice that the pictures proved nothing except that thousands in the concentration camps died from sickness and malnutrition? Who noticed that no TV program ever showed a film or a picture of a ‘gas chamber’ either in operation or capable of being put into operation—the only point in which Germar Rudolf holds a different viewpoint from media outfits such as Report ? Report spewed falsehoods and lies into the world. One of them was seized upon by Franziska Hundseder in her book Rechte machen Kasse (Righ-wingers Cash In) and will be dealt with in the next sec- tion. Here I will discuss another: 619 In the appendix of his expert report under the heading Danksa- gung (Acknowledgements), Rudolf had thanked a number of persons and institutions who had helped him in many ways in the collection of data or sources, the recovery and analysis of samples, or for any assis- tance in the production of the report. Among these were the firms DEGUSSA AG and Institute Fresenius, since the first had supplied important technical data on the stability of Iron Blue and the second had analyzed most of the samples in Rudolf’s presence and initially with his help. Such acknowledgements are usual in scientific publica-   617 In the referenced book by Max Frisch, Herr Biedermann played just the opposite role of a paper criminal, he was the victim of a criminal (and his own gullibility). But this fact was not made clear to the viewer. 618 Cf. E. Gauss (ed.), Dissecting the Holocaust , op. cit. . (note 22), pp. 31-34. 619 There is a detailed discussion of this broadcast in: W. Schlesiger, Der Fall Rudolf , op. cit. (note 91); there Rudolf disputes that he hid behind the pseudonym Ernst Gauss. He had admit- ted that in the trial in the District Court of Stuttgart, ref. 17 KLs 83/94."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"11. H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 389 tions—also they are polite. In their commentary, Report reproached Rudolf that he had used the names of well-known institutes and firms to give his report the ap- pearance of competence. In view of th e facts just given, this reproach is both malevolent and ridiculous. Report ’s additional assertion that a criminal complaint for fraud had been filed against Rudolf due to this misuse of well-known names, was pure invention. Up to today, Janu- ary 2003, there have been no criminal complaints from any of the per- sons or institutions directly or i ndirectly involved in the production of the report. Report ’s false accusation was a direct smear. Stefan Rocker also participated in an ARD-Tagesthemen news broadcast on June 6, 1996, coveri ng the book-burning trial of the book Grundlagen zur Zeitgeschichte , 620 edited by Rudolf, then before the County Court of Tübingen. A written version of this piece appeared in FAZ ( Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung ) of June 10, 1996, p. 14. It be- gan with the following sentence: “Everyman and the Arsonist: diplom chemist German [621] Rudolf, 31, was sentenced to 14 months imprisonment by the Stuttgart District Court a year ago for incitement to racial hatred and denial of the holo- caust.” Rudolf was also accused of having published a “ pseudo-scientific ” “ hack-job ” titled Grundlagen zur Zeitgeschichte , whereby he had proven himself a repetitious right-wing extremist offender. It was stated he had left the country and was sought by the police. The fact that 100 academics had placed an advertisement in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung during the book-burning trial 622 which criticized the use of censorship and the violation of civil rights by German courts was termed a “ frontal assault on the Federal German justice system ” in this commentary. Throughout that piece, the authors threw everyone who was politically right-of-center into one big brown bucket.

In the book, the author discusses Germar Rudolf or his expert report twice. Both times her discussion is full of errors and falsehoods. For example, in referring to the invented dpa press release about the alleged instability of cyanide compounds, Frau Hundseder con- cludes: “Therefore, this so-called exper t report of Herr Rudolf—like the ex- pert report of Frederick A. Leuchter, which similarly found no traces of cyanide in the walls of Auschwitz-Birkenau crematoria 1 and 2— contains no proof of anything other than the methods by which right- wing extremists conduct historical research.” Though notified in writing about the falsity of the dpa press re- lease she was relying upon, Frau Hundseder never changed her posi- tion on this. The same is true for a passage on page 212 of her book, where she claims I had tried to collect several tens of thousands of deutschmarks in order to buy copies of the death books of the Ausch- witz camp. She gives the impression that I was trying to get the money. But this is not true. The letter quoted by her had already been distort- edly quoted by the above mentioned Report journalists who must have illegally received a complete copy of this letter from the trial record. However, if read completely, the letter reveals that I did not want any money, but was asking several personalities to donate money to a third person I had no persona l connection with. The Verdict a Foregone Conclusion As the trial against Germar Rudolf in the State Security Chamber of the District Court of Stuttgart began at the end of November 1994, there were several media individuals who distinguished themselves by their painful ignorance of the subject matter of the trial. The cause for this seemed to be that no journalis t deemed it necessary to ask for in-   623 Cf.

H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 391 formation from anyone involved in the trial. So it happened that re- peatedly items were misunderstood or misreported. One might not at- tribute purposeful distortion to the journalists if it were not for the fact that these misunderstandings were al ways decidedly unfavorable to Rudolf. The partisan orientation of the Süddeutscher Rundfunk , SDR , an- other public broadcasting station (a lmost all German public broadcast- ing stations are left-wing oriented) was exposed when it decided to report only one side of the story, namely that of the investigating po- lice officer. Since his statements were apparently not critical enough for the SDR , soon items were invented. The SDR took the only two statements from the several hundred pages of correspondence in which Rudolf had mentioned two Jewish personalities in a disapproving way, which were cited by the police officer. SDR then asserted falsely, the officer had characterized the rest of my correspondence “ as the vilest incitement and defamation ”. The SDR also attributed to the police officer that he had understood Rudolf to have said he wanted to “ rewrite the history of Germany from 1871 onward, wit hout the Holocaust or World War II ”, which in view of the absurdity of the statement may cause doubt about the sanity of the journalists involved. And of course, the SDR was silent on the substantial mitigating evidence presented by the de- fense in the following months. 625 With a few exceptions, the entire media was silent until the end of the trial. It could be seen from the behavior of the journalists present that they were not looking for the real story, but were intent on bring- ing in a sacrifice for the Zeitgeist : all but one of them—a new person from Südwestfunk radio—resorted only to the prosecuting attorneys and judges in their search for information. The Stuttgarter Zeitung ( StZ ) provides a clear example of the ten- dentious method of reporting used by the media. Since not enough in- criminating material turned up in the several thousand pages of Ru- dolf’s correspondence that were found in the first house search in Sep- tember 1993, on January 27, 1995, the StZ conjured up “ writing in the hand of the accused with indisputable [...] xenophobic content ”. How- ever, in the whole trial there was never any talk of xenophobia or ra- cism, because there was never any basi s for same.

The Böblinger Kreiszeitung reported in this vein on May 10, 1995, as the trial was nearing its end. There, on page 13 under the headline “ Sentence Before Pentecost ”, one found: “He [the presiding judge] believes that the prosecuting attorney will conclude her case at the next session on May 18 of this year, and that the sentence against the chemist will be handed down before Pentecost unless something unforeseen happens.” How can it be that, according to this press report, the presiding judge can announce before the end of the trial (it ended on June 23, 1995) that the expected judgment will be against the accused, that it will be decided to his disadvantage? It would have made sense to state that the judgment will be given in a case or about the accused. If the journalist here reported the presi ding judge’s words correctly, the choice of words shows the partisanship of the judge; otherwise it shows that of the journalist. It is worthwhile to note the relative emphasis the media gave to the pleadings of the prosecution as oppo sed to that of the defense. On June 13, 1995, the StZ reported the arguments of the public attorney in a detailed 3-column story on page 2, while the defense appearance was covered the following day in a small single-column story which merely recapitulated the events of the trial and did not report any of the argu- ments of the accused. To be fair, it should be mentioned that after the sentence came down on June 24, 1995, Sonnhild Maier, the journalist for the StZ , mentioned some of the defense arguments:   626 The video of this program distributed by the Süddeutscher Rundfunk was correspondingly labeled with the caption “ Neo-Nazi ”."},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"11.

When his expert report became publicly known, he lost his job.” In a 3-column story on June 14, 1995, the Stuttgarter Nachrichten summarized the prosecution case. The st ory gave the defense’s claims responding to the prosecution’s points, but not a single argument sup- porting these claims. Instead of this, the defense arguments were super- ficially refuted by the journalis t Frank Schwaibold using somewhat erroneous counterarguments. Against the assertion of the prosecution that Rudolf had revealed himself as a politically motivated crim inal by his work under the pseu- donym Ernst Gauss and therefore deserved no probation, the defense objected that the Gauss case could not be applied. It was hidden from the reader that in a state under the rule of law an accused can not be disadvantaged through a court case that had not even started. In re- sponse to the defense counterargumen t to the prosecution charge that Rudolf cooperated with Remer, j ournalist Frank Schwaibold asserted falsely that Rudolf had met and talked with Remer three times. The truth is that Rudolf and Remer met only by chance in the course of Ru- dolf’s work as expert witness for Remer’s defense attorney. During these accidental encounters, there was no conversation between them, which even the court acknowledged. 628 Against the defense assertion that the accused was no neo-Nazi, the journalist cited a letter absurdly out of context in which Rudolf “ re- ferred to the ‘Jew Republic Germany’ in context with the person Ignatz Bubis” . In that letter, 629 Rudolf criticized a proposal made in spring   627 Because of the Remer’s commented version, the University of St uttgart refused to give Rudolf an appointment to take the rigorosum , the final examination for his PhD title. 628 Confidential letter of G.

Taking into consideration that Bubis had almost no political experience at that time but had a criminal past, Rudolf commented that the proposal re- flected the immense importance that was given to him as the leader of a diminishing minority in the German state (the late Ignatz Bubis was head of the Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland , Central Council of Jews in Germany, at that time). For that reason, Rudolf stated that it was appropriate to rename the name of the German nation, using this minority as a prefix: Judenrepublik Deutschland (Jew Republic of Germany). 630 The Jewish witness Horst Lummert, who testified on be- half of Germar Rudolf, confirmed before the court on January 9, 1995, that this reasoning was justified. 631 Given these facts, it remains for Frank Schwaibold to explain to us where neo-Nazism is hidden in Rudolf’s remarks. Execution by Media Naturally, after the announcement of the sentence of the District Court of Stuttgart, according to which Rudolf was to be punished with 14 months imprisonment without probation, the media found it easy to drag Germar Rudolf through the mud. The first was the Süddeutscher Rundfunk . Following the imperative of the Zeitgeist , without making use of the decision of the court or any other evidence, it labeled Rudolf a “ neo-Nazi ”. It also attempted to make the Rudolf expert report ridicu- lous by resurrecting the dpa notice from a year before. SDR 3 simply claimed that it was known to compet ent chemists that cyanide com- pounds disintegrate within a few weeks in rocks. 632 The program Landesschau of the regional television station Süd- west 3 made comments similar to those of SDR 3 , but piled even fur- ther on the defamation by misrepresenting an article that appeared in the Stuttgarter Nachrichten the week before.

H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 395 1995, was entitled “ Only a Victim of the ‘Father-figure of Neo- Nazism’? ”. Under the Word “ Neo-Nazism ,” a picture of the accused was shown. The question raised by this newspaper headline was whether Rudolf had been a victim of O. E. Remer, who was identified as the “ Father-figure of Neo-Nazism ”. In filming a copy of this article, the Südwestfunk bent the paper so that the viewer would see only the words “ Father-figure of Neo- Nazism ” over the photograph of Rudolf. The viewer would unavoid- ably receive the impression that the harsh sentence on Rudolf was a judicial determination that with Rudolf one was dealing with the fa- ther-figure of Neo-Nazism. It is difficult to imagine how media distor- tion could get any worse. Many media sources considered the sentence handed down by the court as an insufficient condemnation of Rudolf, as can be seen from several examples. On June 24, 1995, the Böblinger Bote wrote that Rudolf could be linked to National Socialist race doctrine. This com- plete fabrication is so absurd and so far from any reality that it was never an issue during the course of the trial, nor was it mentioned in the court’s spoken opinion giving the basis for the written verdict. Un- fortunately, this did not hinder th e court from inserting this unfounded assertion into the written verdict for the sentence. 633 On the same day, and despite Rudolf’s personal appeal, Frank Schwaibold of the Stuttgarter Nachrichten could not help but once again misconstrue the contacts between Rudolf and Remer, in that he wrote, Rudolf had been “ provably in personal contact with Remer three times ”, where the word “ personal ” imputed a relationship be- tween the two that had never existed. On June 24, 1995, the Süddeutsche Zeitung outdid itself in ma- nipulating the news. It wrote that Rudolf had occasionally been a member of the right-wing extremist Republican Party. But, in fact, Ru- dolf had been a member of the party at a time when it was not consid- ered “ right-wing extremist ” and even important members of the semi- conservative Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) maintained contacts with members of the party.

Also, Rudolf was not on trial for his political beliefs, which, according to Article 3, Para. 3 of the German Basic Law can never be cause for deprivation of rights. Finally, it is absurd to try to associate the patriotic-conservative vi ews of the Republicans with the National Socialist views of Remer, which was clearly the intention of the Süddeutsche Zeitung . The Süddeutsche Zeitung also was the only one of Germany’s big- ger daily newspapers that again tro tted out the fable of the supposedly long-ago refuted Rudolf expert report, based on the dpa notice: “According to information from competent chemists, hydrogen cya- nide compounds disintegrate within a few months from the effects of weather and are no longer detectable.” With this perpetual falsehood, the point was made to every unini- tiated reader that the Rudolf expert report was the technically worthless hack-job of an incompetent chemist. At the beginning of the trial on November 23, 1994, the Böblinger Bote had spread the same nonsense: “According to expert opinion, no traces of cyanide can be found af- ter 50 years since they disintegrate quickly.” In their report of 1997, p. 64, even the Bavarian Office for the Pro- tection of the Constitution ( Bayerisches Amt für Verfassungsschutz ) has the nerve to repeat that nonsense. In view of the supposedly proven pseudo-science in the Rudolf expert report, the newspapers avoided the words “ expert report ” or printed them in quotation marks and also characterized it as a “ hack- job ” ( StZ , November 23, 1994). However, on that date, November 23, 1994, the court declared that it did not consider itself competent to de- cide to what extent the expert report satisfied scientific criteria. It avoided the issue of scientific evidence by attributing to Rudolf the preface and epilogue written by Remer’s friend in Remer’s version and sentenced Rudolf on that basis. In a wider context, Hans Westra, Director of the Anne Frank Foundation in the Netherlands, has commented on the technical cor- rectness of the Rudolf expert repor t.

News for Public Instruction The day of the announcement of the sentence in the case of Ger- mar Rudolf may be the only one in which the media outside the local region reported on it. As mentioned above, the Süddeutsche Zeitung devoted an extensive story to the sentence. Also, on June 23, 1995, the nationwide TV news show heute of the ZDF (German public Television 2) felt called on to write a short story reporting that the diplom chemist Germar Rudolf had been sen- tenced to 14 months imprisonment without probation on account of an expert report on the gas chambers of Auschwitz. Since as the media outside the local region had reported almost nothing on the case previ- ous to this, the normal television vi ewer would hardly know what to do with this very brief piece of information. Therefore, the report can have had only one purpose: It should be made clear to every potential technical witness Republic-wide that those who voice views about the Holocaust complex that deviate from those officially allowed— however factually correct, reputable, scientific and perhaps even pro- fessionally correct—will be thrown in jail without probation. The news reports of the local press on May 6, 1996, ran in the same direction after my application for a revision of the verdict was turned down by the German Federal Supreme Court. They hinted to the reader that the scientist Rudolf had been sentenced because of his ex- pert report, which had come to an incorrect conclusion and thereby denied the Holocaust. It apparently did not interest anyone that the ex- pert report had not been an issue at the trial.

The press ini- tially lost track of him and for the time being, lost interest as well. This changed in the fall of 1999, when Br itish journalist Chris Hastings (34) set about tracking him down in England. Since Rudolf had registered, as required by law, and residency records are open to the public, it was not difficult to establish that Rudolf was residing in England. In addi- tion, Rudolf had listed his post office address on his website (PO Box 118, Hastings TN34 3ZQ.) Chris Hastings succeeded in locating the apartment in which Rudolf was registered. He left a note requesting an interview. Rudolf granted his request by allowing him a two hour in- terview at Victoria station in London. The content of this interview concerned primarily the present state of human rights in Germany as well as the official persecution of Rudolf. But as Rudolf suspected, Hastings was not interested in the present state of human rights in Germany. In Hastings’ article in the Sunday Telegraph of Oct. 17, 1999, the subject was not even mentioned. Instead, under a subtitle demagogically slandering Rudolf as a “ neo-nazi ”, Hastings wrote: 636 “He [Rudolf] confirms that, during his stay in Britain, he has forged links with far-Right extremists including members of the National Front   635 Kreiszeitung Böblinger Bote and Gäubote/Südwestpresse-Verbund , May 6, 1996. 636 Jessica Berry and Chris Hastings, “ German neo-Nazi fugitive is found hiding in Britain ”, The Sunday Telegraph , Oct. 17, 1999; repeated on Oct. 18, 1999 in the Independent."},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"11.

I have met leading members of the Nati onal Front and the British National Party while I have been in England.’” In the worst tradition of yellow journalism, Hastings took individ- ual words and phrases totally out of context and rearranged them to suit his sensationalistic purposes. Rudolf never uttered such sentences, with the exception of the sentence about working 24 hours a day for revisionism. It is a fact that, in the spring of 1999, Rudolf met with Nick Griffin and discussed Griffin’s experiences with the British jus- tice system. The year before, Griffin was, among other things, accused of having published an article with revisionist statements in a small right-wing periodical edited by himself, but he had been acquitted. Be- cause of Rudolf’s own exposed position, and because he had exten- sively reported on official censorship in his publication Viertel- jahreshefte für freie Geschichtsforschung ( VffG ) before, Rudolf was naturally very interested in Griffin’s story, but he was not interested in Griffin’s organizational memberships or functions. Before this meet- ing, Rudolf was not aware that Griffin held a leading position in the nationalist British National Party. Ho wever, during the meeting, Grif- fin informed him that he aspired to chairmanship of the party, to which position he was subsequently elected. When asked by Hastings whether he was in contact with members of the political right, Rudolf straightforwardly told him of the conversation with Griffin. Hastings used this to suggest to his readers that Rudolf had forged contacts with the organizational leadership of the leading rightwing extremist parties of England. But to the best of his knowledge, Rudolf has never made contact with any member of the National Front. Hastings went so far as to interview Rudolf’s former landlady, whom he absurdly quoted as follows: “Sheila Evans, Rudolf’s former landlady, said: ‘I remember he said he was a writer working for journals in Germany. I was struck by how clean he left the house when he left. He stripped it bare. I think he was trying to cover his tracks.’” In fact, when he negotiated the tenancy contract in July 1996, Ru- dolf had told his landlady that he will write for a German periodical.

Mrs. Evans was the most ferocious house-dragon that Rudolf ever met. When Rudolf moved out, he had to repair and repaint ever y little scratch on the skirting boards, every bit of chipped enamel on door frames and heaters, every tiny dent in the walls before she woul d return his deposit. Surely it was normal behavior for Rudolf to take his belongings with him when he moved out. It seems that when people read about their neighbors in the newspapers, they see ghosts and goblins everywhere. Chris Hastings continued to make Rudolf’s presence and activities known to a very large number of nosy and peculiar people. He prompted them to agree that Engla nd needs a law to protect holocaust lore against scientific examination. And he prompted them to agree that Rudolf should be extradited to Germany immediately. The results were not long in coming. The established media in Germany ground out another sensationalistic story. “ Indicted Neo-nazi in Great Britain ”, blared the dpa (German Press Agency) on October 18, 1999 (it was printed on the 19th in Rheinpfalz and other places.) “ Holocaust denier hiding out in England ” announced the leftwing Stuttgarter Nachrichten on October 21, page 4. On October 31, Chris Hastings jubilantly announced in the Sunday Telegraph that Germany would now seriously pursue Rudolf’s extradition. He predicted that England would comply because Rudolf had not been convicted for holocaust denial, but for incitement to racial hatred, which is a viola- tion of English law, too. 638 On October 22, the local press in Hastings, where Rudolf resided, chimed in with “ Fleeing neo-nazi uses base in Hastings ” ( The Hastings and St. Leonards Observer ). The monthly English manhunter tabloid Searchlight joined the hunt in December with “ Auschwitz liar hides out in Britain ” on page 13. 639 Chris Hast- ings added more wood to the flames in his update of January 16, 2000: “ Neo-nazi accused of ‘racial hatred’ goes on the run [...] Germany has issued an international arrest warrant for Germar Rudolf, who fled to England to escape a prison sentence for inciting racial hatred .” The manhunt turned completely into hysteria with a BBC report about Rudolf on March 28, 2000, which was repeated the day after by   637 Address: Castle Hill Publishers, PO Box 118, Hastings TN34 3ZQ, UK; online: http://vho.org/VffG 638 This was echoed, e.g. , by the Australian Jewish News , Nov. 5, 1999. 639 The German matching piece to this periodical, blick nach rechts , started its campaign as late as June 2000 with a contribution by Thomas Pfeiffer in the same style, of course."},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"11.

The public was warned to beware of this “ nazi sympathizer ”. The audience must have gained the impression that Rudolf was so dangerous that he was running around murdering people. Mr. Michael Whine of the British Jewish Board of Deputies was pleased to appear before the cameras and announce that regarding Rudolf, England was dealing with a “ new breed of dangerous nazis ”. The local press chimed in once more with “ Escaped Neo-nazi still hid- ing in Hastings [...] he [...] was still being hunted .” ( The Hastings and St. Leonards Observer , March 31, 2000). Obviously, the powers that be are striving to familiarize the local populace with Rudolf’s likeness and condition them to be afraid of him. It wants them to complain to the police about the desperado in their midst. On May 27, 2000, Günther Hoerbst of the Hamburger Abendblatt reported on a report of the Israeli university of Tel Aviv entitled “ Anti- Semitism Worldwide 1998/99 ”: “Twelve pages of the report are dedicated to Germany. The report complains about the growing acceptan ce of the holocaust lie, primarily by means of the internet and rightwing extremist groups. The report ac- knowledges that present German legislation provides the most ‘advanced and effective attempts at combating the holocaust lie’, but ‘it neverthe- less is a growing phenomenon’. For instance, the leading German holo- caust liar Rudolf continues to disseminate his writings over the internet from foreign countries, even though he has been convicted and sentenced in Germany.” What a pity that is! So far, the only more or less impartial article about Rudolf has ap- peared on January 7, 2000, in the Los Angeles Times , in connection with the Irving vs. Lipstadt trial. It was written by Kim Murphy. 640 Freedom of the Press = A Truthful Press?

The District Court of Stuttgart sentenced Germar Rudolf to 14 months imprisonment without probation for the reasons that Rudolf was deeply marked with anti-Semitism, that he was entangled in a re- visionist and right-wing extremist environment, and that he was obvi- ously a fanatical, politically motivated criminal. In that moment, the court gave the media license to vilify and malign Germar Rudolf with- out let or hindrance, since in the Federal Republic of Germany, anyone labeled as an anti-Semite or right-wing extremist is a de facto outlaw. That the court did not find that Rudolf was a right-wing extremist, merely that he had had dealings with supposedly “ right-wing extrem- ist ” persons, was of secondary importance and in view of the media practice of imputing guilt by association no cause to hold back. Ru- dolf’s applications for rebuttal in the press were denied out-of-hand, since in the meantime the version of the story spread by the press had been confirmed by the courts. In a democracy, the people are the sovereign. Should the voice of the people become the voice of God not only with respect to power, but also partly with respect to infallibility, care must be taken that the people are comprehensively and truthfully informed. In this modern information age, the media play the central role in forming the public will. For this reason, it must be guaranteed that the people are compre- hensively and truthfully informed. The intentional presentation of false and one-sided information to the public must automatically lead to false conceptions of reality and thence to unwise political decisions. The intentional presentation of disinformation through suppression of news or spreading of false news should be considered one of the most serious crimes of a political na- ture that can be committed in a democracy. The question of the executive and judicial means by which the people can be guaranteed to be kept comprehensively and truthfully informed is bound to be a difficult one in view of the fundamental freedoms of press and speech. It would be necessary to require, for example, that the media be subject to democratic control in that the formation of political or economic monopolies would be prevented. One proposal would be to allow access to the media in their area of operations to political parties proportional to the vote they received or to socially-concerned organizations (such as religions) proportional to their membership, without a limiting minimum percent."},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"11.

Outlawed in the Federal Republic of Germany The Disfranchisement of Unwelcome Citizens 642 In antiquity and in the Middle Ages, many European nations pos- sessed the legal power to disfranc hise citizens for gross misdeeds. With the rise of secularized constitutional nations, the use of this power disappeared until it resurfaced in the 3rd Reich as Thought- crime Laws. In the Federal Republic of Germany, the possibility of far- reaching revocations of civil rights was built right into the constitution in Article 18 of the Basic Law, but until recently no use was made of it. Jochen Lober has shown that the equivalent curtailment of the civil rights of citizens has been achieved by extra-constitutional regula- tion. 643 We will examine here Lober’s question, whether a form of de facto outlawry was introduced with the revision of section 130 of the German Penal Code, which made any kind of Holocaust denial—or revisionism—and opposition to multi-culturalism a potential criminal offense punishable by up to five years in prison. This will be done by studying the fate of Auschwitz researcher Diplom-Chemist Germar Rudolf.

On November 5, 1992, this Hermann Körber filed a criminal com- plaint with State Attorney Baumann in Schweinfurt against Germar Rudolf for instigating Otto Ernst Remer to incitement to racial ha- tred. 644 He claimed that it was Rudolf and his expert report that had caused Remer to begin publishing material on the Holocaust in his Remer Depesche ( Remer Dispatches ). 645 Subsequently, the state attor- ney of Schweinfurt initiated a crimin al investigation against Rudolf on grounds of incitement to racial ha tred, and others, in which O. E. Remer was also named. 646 Both accused denied the accusations. Then, on April, 19, 1993, at the state attorney’s office in Bielefeld, Körber filed a witness affidavit in which he stated: 647 “As a Diplom Chemist, Rudolf knows and must know that his theses are scientifically untenable. It can be proven that that which Rudolf convinced Remer of is trick- ery.” On April 27, 1993, as proof of his assertion that Rudolf was know- ingly deceitful, Körber filed another affidavit in which he interpreted Rudolf’s technical arguments made in an exchange of correspondence with Werner Wegner, as incitement to racial hatred, and characterized   644 Investigation File 1 in the trial against Germar Rudolf, District Court of Stuttgart, ref. 17 KLs 83/94, sheet 15. 645 The Remer Depesche had already appeared in Spring 1991, before Rudolf had begun his re- search as expert witness. 646 Ref. 8 Js 13182/92, Investigation File 1 (Distr ict Court Stuttgart, ref. 17 KLs 83/94), sheet 17ff. 647 Ibid., sheet 58."},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 406 Rudolf’s assertion that unambiguous technical evidence was superior to ambiguous documentary evidence as “ unscientific and unprofes- sional procedure ”. 648 In another affidavit made on April 30, 1993, Körber asserted falsely that Rudolf supported “the Leuchter thesis that there was a danger of explosion through- out the Auschwitz compound, at leas t for structures, whenever gassing operations with Zyklon B were going on.” Rudolf had in fact stated that the use of high concentrations of Zyklon B to reduce execution periods to minutes or seconds, as the witnesses had reported, would mean that there would be safety prob- lems due to explosive concentrations of hydrogen cyanide. 649 He had never spoken nor written of a ge neral danger of explosion. The busy witness Körber was at it again on May 26, 1993, this time to assert that the references to the Rudolf Report in various edi- tions of the Remer Depesche proved that the author Rudolf was the cause. Körber also claimed that Rudol f’s attempt to testify as an expert witness, which was refused by the court, constituted conspiracy to commit perjury. 650 On June 7, 1993, he repeated his accusations that Rudolf had instigated Remer to his misdeeds in the Remer Depesche , and offered evidence that would defer the possible termination of the investigation. 651 It should be pointed out that there is no mention among Körber’s statements of the fact that Germar Rudolf had written him a lengthy letter in January 1993, in which Rudolf presented detailed arguments supporting the conclusions of his report. 652 Körber had never answered the letter. His only response had been to make false accusations about Rudolf to the police. In mid-April 1993, the state attorney of Stuttgart set in motion an- other prosecution against Germar Rudolf in addition to the ongoing prosecution concerning incitement.

The first copies of Remer’s version were sent to various notable personalities in politics, justice, and science on April 16, 1993. 653 On the same day, Prof. Dr. Hanns F.

In any case there was no attempt by the MPG administration to terminate Rudolf’s em- ployment at that time. In mid-May 1993, Rudolf received at his office two calls from journalists (the German weekly magazine stern and the private TV sta- tion SAT 1 ) dealing with the distribution of the Remer version. During one of these calls, a colleague of Rudolf was in the room. The col- league later told another collea gue, Jörg Sassmannshausen, who im- mediately reported the event to the executive Director of the Max- Planck-Institute, Prof. Arndt Simon. 655 Subsequently, Germar Rudolf was asked not to appear at the In stitute anymore unless at the explicit request of his doctoral supervisor, Prof. Dr. H. G. von Schnering, in order to make sure that there might be no further contact with journal- ists during work hours. His employment contract had not been men- tioned. This request was subsequently repeated in writing.

Rudolf was seen by Institute workers, however, and they reported his presence to the executive director. Second Step: Professional Ruin Rudolf had neglected to ask his doctoral supervisor for permission to enter the Institute. The followi ng day he was asked to accept termi- nation of his employment contract without notice. 656 The justification for this was primarily that Rudolf had sent letters on stationary with the Max-Planck-Institute letterhead while working on the Report. Ru- dolf had privately engaged the Fresen ius Institute to analyze the wall samples from Auschwitz for traces of cyanide. But when the Fresenius Institute was already working on his samples in Rudolf’s presence, he handed in a letter typed on a letter head of his employer with a detailed specification of the work to be conducted by the Fresenius Institute and a detailed description of the samples. Though the unauthorized use of official letterheads for private pur poses was widespread at the Max- Planck-Institute at the time, in Rudolf’s case it became a no-no. It was this use of Institute letterhead, about which the management of the In- stitute first became aware through news reports, 657 that established the connection of the Institute with the Rudolf Report. Apparently because of the failure of the MPG to respond to the in- tercession of I. Bubis (see above), on June 22, 1993, the Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland (Central Council of Jews in Germany) felt it necessary to notify the President of th e MPG that he was expected to take appropriate measures to restrict the activities of Report researcher Germar Rudolf. On July 14, 1993, the President of the MPG informed the Central Council that the MPG had no further responsibility for the activities of Herr Rudolf, since he had been fired. The subsequent labor court pr oceeding instituted by Rudolf against the Max-Planck-Institute with respect to his termination with- out notice turned on the question, whether the generally-practiced and in his case already known infraction “ private use of official letterhead ” could be used as grounds for dismissal without notice when the Auschwitz issue was mixed in. Labor court judge Stolz made it clear   656 This description is based on the transcript of Rudolf’s testimony from memory from this time, Computer Data File 2, (District Court Stuttgart, ref. 17 KLs 83/94), 175-220. 657 Wiesbadener Kurier on 8./9. and 13.

This amounts to the principle that Rudolf and others who think like him are outlaws with respect to the labor law. For reasons of social concern, the Max-Planck-Institute offered to make an agreement with the plaintiff out of court, by which the termination without notice would be revoked and at the same time replaced by a mutual agreement that the employment contract would be terminated, barring further recourse. 658 Despite this dispute between Rudolf and his now former em- ployer, his doctoral supervisor Prof . H. G. von Schnering continued to support his doctoral candidate and in July 1993 certified that Rudolf possessed the necessary professional and ethical qualification to take the next step, the final examination called the Rigorosum. In that month, Rudolf submitted to the University of Stuttgart his doctoral the- sis with all necessary supporting documents and applied for admission to the Rigorosum. By fall 1993, however, permission for the promotion had still not been granted. On inquiry at the University, Rudolf was told that his application had been put on hold because of the criminal investigation initiated against Rudolf for incitement to racial hatred as well as that against O. E. Remer for distribution of Remer’s version of the Rudolf Report. The University of Stuttgart maintained that it was questionable whether the candida te possessed the necessary ethical qualification. The grounds for this decision was section 4 of the Law On Aca- demic Degrees, enacted by Adolf Hitler in 1939 and still in force in Germany today. By this provision, an academic degree can be revoked or withheld, if one does not possess the necessary ethical qualification. According to a decision of the Administrative Court of Baden- Württemberg, an academic title can only be withheld when there has been a judicial sentence for a seri ous crime that has been entered on the person’s police record of conduct. 659   658 Labor Court of Stuttgart, ref. 14 Ca 6663/93.

At the behest of the University of Stuttgart, the County Court Stuttgart stalled on grounds that the ongoing criminal proceeding against Rudolf would have to be conc luded before it could be decided whether Rudolf possessed the necessary qualifications for promotion. 660 After the sentence against Rudolf was handed down in March 1996, the University of Stuttgart advised him that it was in his best interest to withdraw his application for promotion, since otherwise the University most likely would refuse his application because of Ru- dolf’s conviction for a severe crime. Rudolf complied, because he might otherwise have to reckon with the problem that his doctoral work might be unacceptable everywhere else in the world. 661 By good fortune, in fall 1994 Rudolf obtained a position as a field representative with a firm dealing in corrosion inhibiting products. During her research into ‘right-wing businesses’, left-wing journalist F. Hundseder stumbled onto the fact that Rudolf was employed at one of them. In the ARD broadcast Panorama in mid-May 1995, this dis- covery was described as a scandal, and both the company and their employee Rudolf as heinous Neo-Nazis. The company came immedi- ately under such heavy pressure from customers, suppliers, employees and competitors that by mutual agreement they and Rudolf terminated his employment contract in order to prevent further loss to the com- pany. Due to this denunciation by the media, Rudolf lost his job within a few days. In the current state of German labor law, if in future applications for employment Rudolf were not to mention his revisionist activities and this were to become known to his employer, it would be consid- ered grounds for dismissal.

H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 411 in Germany. 662 Third Step: Persecution through Prosecution A more complete analysis of the prosecution against Rudolf will be left to other works. Rudolf was accused not only because of Remer’s political commentary, which was falsely attributed to Rudolf, but also because of the purely technical conclusions in his Report. 663 In the principal hearing Presiding Judge Dr. Dietmar Mayer stated that the competence of the court did not extend to the evaluation of the sci- entific validity of the expert report. Because of this, the contents of the expert report were not addressed in the proceeding, but only the ques- tion whether the defendant was responsible for Remer’s commentary. In its decision, the court made no secret of the fact that it held re- visionist thinking itself to be reprehensible and punishable by increas- ing the severity of the sentence. 664 However, the sentence against Ru- dolf to 14 months prison without probation was based on the false con- tention that Rudolf had at least knowingly contributed to the political commentary contained in Remer’s version of his expert report. The court justified its sentence with a tiresomely assembled chain of proofs amounting to 240 pages which in decisive points departed from the actual evidence and which completely ignored the contradictory evi- dence on the main point of the defense. The chemical and construction problems of the buildings at Auschwitz dealt with in the Rudolf Report were characterized by the court as “ hardly clarifiable details of the National Socialist mass- crimes ”, thus, under no circumstance a matter of ‘common knowl- edge’. 665 Rudolf’s trial on account of the business with Remer’s version ended in summer 1995. Under which star this trial was held was made blindingly clear by a document from the trial records: Rudolf’s judges in the District Court of Stuttgart wanted to prevent that they them- selves should come under the wheels of denunciation and inquisition, as had the judges of the District Court of Mannheim in the Günter Deckert Case, who were massively criticized by media and politicians,   662 There remained the non-ordinary wa y that he has followed successfully. 663 Criminal indictment by the States Attorney of Stuttgart on 19.

Before the opening of the trial against Rudolf, Rudolf’s judges therefore carefully inquired with the German Federal Supreme Court with respect to its decision against Günter Deckert and receive an im- mediate reply. 666 Since the German Federal Supreme Court revised the Deckert decision so many times until a sentence of imprisonment without probation was certain, it is obvious that in the Rudolf Case the same sentence of imprisonment without probation was the only option if the judges wanted to stay out of trouble. At the same time as the above-mentioned prosecution, there were three other prosecutions underway against Germar Rudolf. In the first case, he was accused of being mainly or at least partially responsible for the publication of the journals Remer Depesche and Deutschland Report . 667 The second involved his publication of the work Grundla- gen zur Zeitgeschichte . 668 The third was directed against an exchange of correspondence between Rudolf and the Cracow Institute for Foren- sic Research on chemical questions concerning the gas chambers of Auschwitz that was published in Sleipnir , issue 3, 1995. 587 It was clear already then that th ese would not be the last measures taken against Rudolf, especially since he intended to defend himself in print. In view of the fact that the Di strict Court of Stuttgart was able to find the defendant guilty contrary to the evidence, one could justifiably fear that in each outstanding trial, the innocent defendant would be found just as guilty, and that he would find himself incarcerated under the terms of several sentences of increasing severity. In the meantime, Rudolf’s home had been searched three times, and each time books, archives, correspondence, technical data and his computer equipment were seized. The principal loss was not that of physical items, but the intellectual loss of data and archive material. The result was that Rudolf could no longer work as a scientist and also could not defend himself unrestrictedly in court, since his resources to   666 Trial District Court Stuttgart, ref. 17 KLs 83/ 94, Letter of the 17th Criminal Justice Chamber of the District Court of Stuttgart to the Federal High Court (BGH) on April 21, 1994.

Only those who have themselves undergone the same thing can judge the psychological stress caused to an innocent person through undergoing years-long criminal prosecutions. In addition to these psy- chic burdens, there are the legal expenses to consider. Currently, they can be calculated only with difficulty but, loosely estimated, they must run into a few hundred thousand Dollars. It is clear that at the close of the trial against him, Rudolf was fi nancially ruined for the foreseeable future—quite apart from the fact th at for the foreseeable future he would be given no chance to meet these burdens through employment in his profession, at least not within Germany. Fourth Step: Defamation At the close of the labor court hearing of the case against the Max- Planck-Institute, the Deutsche Presse-Agentur ( dpa) published its al- ready mentioned false announcement on the Rudolf Report. Rudolf not only proved that the e xpert opinion cited in this an- nouncement by the dpa was wholly fabricated – the MPG distanced itself from the announcement – but also that the report based on the phantom opinion is so false that no expert in the world would embrace it. But this does not hinder the media to spread the announcement far and wide and to use it as proof of the obvious falseness of the Rudolf Report. 669 In the meantime, this false pr ess release even appeared in the media in foreign countries. 670 Since then, Rudolf has been defamed as a right-wing radical, 671 a right-wing extremist, 672 a Neo-Nazi 673 and a brown doctoral candidate. 674 His Report is always named in quotation- marks, and characterized as hack-work 675 or merely as a “ false re- port ”. 676 Unfounded accusations of xenophobia 677 are accompanied by   669 See chapter 11.5.

Fifth Step: Destruction of the Personal World When the ARD smeared Rudolf in the most vicious way in its spring 1994 broadcast Report , 679 Rudolf’s parents distanced them- selves from him and refused to come to his wedding, scheduled for several weeks later. All his relatives joined them in this, except for his siblings. 680 His godmother Hannelore Dörschler distanced herself ex- pressly from the views of the people with whom Rudolf surrounded himself, without knowing with which persons Rudolf actually sur- rounded himself or what views they held. 681 Since November 2, 1983, Germar Rudolf had belonged to the Catholic German Student Fraternity AV Tuisconia Königsberg in Bonn.

H UNTING G ERMAR R UDOLF 415 When Rudolf’s revisionist activity became known in spring 1994, the umbrella organization exerted pressure on Rudolf’s organization to expel him. Because of this, his organization convened a session of various of its members that spring, without the knowledge or participa- tion of Rudolf, at which his revisionist activity was discussed. An ex- pulsion process followed that held a hearing on August 20, 1994, and ended by expelling him in the fall. This expulsion was by reason that: 683 “The Holocaust and the acknowledgement thereof is the normative foundation of our [German] Constitution. The legitimacy—in the sense of worthiness of acceptance—of the Ba sic Law is based on the recognition of the fact of National Socialist criminal measures by which Jews were subject to a systematic technical mass murder. Inasmuch as Fraternity Brother Rudolf raises doubts about the deliberate annihilation of the Jews, he also raises doubts about the normative consensus on which the Basic Law is based. Content (normative consensus) and fo rm (institutional order) of the Basic Law are inextricably interwoven and their substance cannot be al- tered. Thereby, Fraternity Brother Rudolf violates our Patria Principle.” The Patria Principle is one of the four principles of the semi- conservative umbrella organization. 684 Today, the principle is primarily understood as meaning constitutional patriotism. It is left to the reader to judge the mental health of th e lawyers that composed these pro- nouncements. The fact is that the decision to expel Rudolf because of the pressure from the superior organization was inescapable, and it was admitted that the decision would have been otherwise, had there been no outside pressure. 685 Sixth Step: Homelessness When the police searched Rudolf’s home a second time on August 18, 1994, the local media described him as a well-known right-wing extremist personality.

Seventh Step: Special Treatment On May 5, 1995, the GRÜNE/Alternative Liste (a radical-left en- vironmental splinter party) of th e parliament of Hamburg demanded access to court records in the Rudolf case. Though denied at first, a subsequent request for records access on July 3, 1995, apparently suc- ceeded, 689 although it is not legal to grant access to the court records to outside persons who have no direct inte rest in a case. It is reasonable to fear that the records may have come into the hands of radical anti- fascist groups, where data on witnesses could be collected and com- pared. The dot on the ‘i’ was the request on October 16, 1994, of the Pro- ject for Study of Anti-Semitism, Faculty of Humanities of the Univer- sity of Tel Aviv, in which a certain Sarah Rembiszewski requested in- formation on the state of Rudolf’s prosecution. 690 The judges also were aware of the world-wide attenti on on the case. Tel Aviv also pressed for records access. Is it possible to hope that records access will remain denied despite the ever more strident pleas out of Tel Aviv, inasmuch as the research institute has no lega l claim to such access? Under cur- rent law, access to court records cannot normally be granted to outside persons with no interest in a case.

Having built up a revisionist publishing com- pany abroad, his wife decided at the end of 1998 that she could not bear the life in exile, permanently fearing the extradition of her hus- band, being separated from all her old friends and relatives, having difficulties to find new friends and acquaintances, and thus heavily suffering from homesickness. Hence, in early 1999, she and their two children returned to Germany and later started the divorce procedure from her husband, leaving him alone in exile. In fall 1999, when the British media started a smear campaign against Rudolf, the nightmare of his wife became true: Rudolf became fair game of British politics, media and the justice system. 692 Had it been possible for his wife and his children until then to visit Rudolf frequently, this turned out to be ex tremely difficult ever after, since Rudolf left Europe in late 1999 and entered the USA, where he applied for Political Asylum in October 2000. Especially the abandoned father and his two children suffer terribly unde r this situation of being almost totally isolated from each other. In February 2000, Rudolf’s father urged him to get sterilized, since it would be irresponsible both for his first family as well as in general—considering the conditions he has to live in—to father any more children: 693 “Hallo    Germar,    [...] If you want to avoid such difficulties in future [...] , and you should do this, regarding getting children, I mean, you should do something about it. Don’t leave it up to the women. You surely know how easy vasoliga- ture is for a man. Except you want to have more children. But to be hon- est, you cannot do this to your first family. And especially not in your situation. A chat with the urologist, and it already happened. You are up- set about me? So be it. Just see it objectively. [...] Father”” Formerly, the persecution of the Jews by some Germans led to consideration to get certain Jews sterilized. Today, the persecution of Germans, mainly promoted by some Jewish lobbies, leads to consid-   692 See chapter 11.5. 693 Email from Georg Hermann Rudolf from February 19, 2000."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"11.

Biographical Notes on the Author Germar Rudolf, a certified chemist, was born on October 29, 1964, in Limburg/Lahn, Germany.

Completion of compulsory military service with the German Luftwaffe (Air Force). Be- tween October 1990 and June 1993, Mr. Rudolf worked on the prepara- tion of a doctoral thesis at the Max- Planck-Institute for Solid State Re- search in Stuttgart. Despite the high- est recommendations, he was forced to withdraw his dissertation, because the University of Stuttgart threat- ened to rejected it on political grounds (due to his involvement in revisionism). Since early 1993, he has been the defendant in several criminal prosecutions resulting from the pub- lication of scientific texts; in March 1996, he left his native Germany and went into exile, first England, then, in late 1999, the United States. In late 1996, Mr. Rudolf founded the publishing house Castle Hill Pub- lishers and, simultaneously, a quar- terly historical periodical of German language, the aim of which is to deal with critical aspects of contemporary history currently suppressed in all German speaking countries. In 2000, he started publishing English lan- guage books on revisionist topics under the imprint of Theses & Dis- The Author in summer 1991, while doing the main work for this expert report The author in late 2002"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"G ERMAR R UDOLF · T HE R UDOLF R EPORT 422 sertations Press, a firm originally established by Robert H.
