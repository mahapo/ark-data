As the means of information and ofpower are centralized, some men come to occupy positions in American societyfrom which they can look down upon, so to speak, and by their decisions mightilyaffect, the everyday worlds of ordinary men and women. They are not made bytheir jobs; they set up and break down jobs for thousands of others; they arenot confined by simple family responsibilities; they can escape. They may livein many hotels and houses, but they are bound by no one community. They need notmerely ‘meet the demands of the day and hour’; in some part, they create thesedemands, and cause others to meet them. Whether or not they profess their power,their technical and political experience of it far transcends that of theunderlying population. What Jacob Burckhardt said of ‘great men,’ most Americansmight well say of their elite: ‘They are all that we are not.’1[ch15_notes.html#ch1en1]The power elite is composed of men whose positions enable them to transcend theordinary environments of ordinary men and women; they are in positions to makedecisions having major consequences. Whether they do or do not make suchdecisions is less important than the fact that they do occupy such pivotalpositions: their failure to act, their failure to make decisions, is itself anact that is often of greater consequence than the decisions they do make. Forthey are in command of the major hierarchies and organizations of modernsociety. They rule the big corporations. They run the machinery of the state andclaim its prerogatives. They direct the military establishment. They occupy thestrategic command posts of the social structure, in which are now centered theeffective means of the power and the wealth and the celebrity which they enjoy.The power elite are not solitary rulers. Advisers and consultants, spokesmen andopinion-makers are often the captains of their higher thought and decision.Immediately below the elite are the professional politicians of the middlelevels of power, in the Congress and in the pressure groups, as well as amongthe new and old upper classes of town and city and region. Mingling with them,in curious ways which we shall explore, are those professional celebrities wholive by being continually displayed but are never, so long as they remaincelebrities, displayed enough. If such celebrities are not at the head of anydominating hierarchy, they do often have the power to distract the attention ofthe public or afford sensations to the masses, or, more directly, to gain theear of those who do occupy positions of direct power. More or less unattached,as critics of morality and technicians of power, as spokesmen of God andcreators of mass sensibility, such celebrities and consultants are part of theimmediate scene in which the drama of the elite is enacted. But that dramaitself is centered in the command posts of the major institutional hierarchies.1The truth about the nature and the power of the elite is not some secret whichmen of affairs know but will not tell. Such men hold quite various theoriesabout their own roles in the sequence of event and decision. Often they areuncertain about their roles, and even more often they allow their fears andtheir hopes to affect their assessment of their own power. No matter how greattheir actual power, they tend to be less acutely aware of it than of theresistances of others to its use. Moreover, most American men of affairs havelearned well the rhetoric of public relations, in some cases even to the pointof using it when they are alone, and thus coming to believe it. The personalawareness of the actors is only one of the several sources one must examine inorder to understand the higher circles. Yet many who believe that there is noelite, or at any rate none of any consequence, rest their argument upon what menof affairs believe about themselves, or at least assert in public.There is, however, another view: those who feel, even if vaguely, that a compactand powerful elite of great importance does now prevail in America often basethat feeling upon the historical trend of our time. They have felt, for example,the domination of the military event, and from this they infer that generals andadmirals, as well as other men of decision influenced by them, must beenormously powerful. They hear that the Congress has again abdicated to ahandful of men decisions clearly related to the issue of war or peace. They knowthat the bomb was dropped over Japan in the name of the United States ofAmerica, although they were at no time consulted about the matter. They feelthat they live in a time of big decisions; they know that they are not makingany. Accordingly, as they consider the present as history, they infer that atits center, making decisions or failing to make them, there must be an elite ofpower.On the one hand, those who share this feeling about big historical events assumethat there is an elite and that its power is great. On the other hand, those wholisten carefully to the reports of men apparently involved in the greatdecisions often do not believe that there is an elite whose powers are ofdecisive consequence.Both views must be taken into account, but neither is adequate. The way tounderstand the power of the American elite lies neither solely in recognizingthe historic scale of events nor in accepting the personal awareness reported bymen of apparent decision. Behind such men and behind the events of history,linking the two, are the major institutions of modern society. These hierarchiesof state and corporation and army constitute the means of power; as such theyare now of a consequence not before equaled in human history—and at theirsummits, there are now those command posts of modern society which offer us thesociological key to an understanding of the role of the higher circles inAmerica.Within American society, major national power now resides in the economic, thepolitical, and the military domains. Other institutions seem off to the side ofmodern history, and, on occasion, duly subordinated to these. No family is asdirectly powerful in national affairs as any major corporation; no church is asdirectly powerful in the external biographies of young men in America today asthe military establishment; no college is as powerful in the shaping ofmomentous events as the National Security Council. Religious, educational, andfamily institutions are not autonomous centers of national power; on thecontrary, these decentralized areas are increasingly shaped by the big three, inwhich developments of decisive and immediate consequence now occur.Families and churches and schools adapt to modern life; governments and armiesand corporations shape it; and, as they do so, they turn these lesserinstitutions into means for their ends. Religious institutions provide chaplainsto the armed forces where they are used as a means of increasing theeffectiveness of its morale to kill. Schools select and train men for their jobsin corporations and their specialized tasks in the armed forces. The extendedfamily has, of course, long been broken up by the industrial revolution, and nowthe son and the father are removed from the family, by compulsion if need be,whenever the army of the state sends out the call. And the symbols of all theselesser institutions are used to legitimate the power and the decisions of thebig three.The life-fate of the modern individual depends not only upon the family intowhich he was born or which he enters by marriage, but increasingly upon thecorporation in which he spends the most alert hours of his best years; not onlyupon the school where he is educated as a child and adolescent, but also uponthe state which touches him throughout his life; not only upon the church inwhich on occasion he hears the word of God, but also upon the army in which heis disciplined.If the centralized state could not rely upon the inculcation of nationalistloyalties in public and private schools, its leaders would promptly seek tomodify the decentralized educational system. If the bankruptcy rate among thetop five hundred corporations were as high as the general divorce rate among thethirty-seven million married couples, there would be economic catastrophe on aninternational scale. If members of armies gave to them no more of their livesthan do believers to the churches to which they belong, there would be amilitary crisis.Within each of the big three, the typical institutional unit has becomeenlarged, has become administrative, and, in the power of its decisions, hasbecome centralized. Behind these developments there is a fabulous technology,for as institutions, they have incorporated this technology and guide it, evenas it shapes and paces their developments.The economy—once a great scatter of small productive units in autonomousbalance—has become dominated by two or three hundred giant corporations,administratively and politically interrelated, which together hold the keys toeconomic decisions.The political order, once a decentralized set of several dozen states with aweak spinal cord, has become a centralized, executive establishment which hastaken up into itself many powers previously scattered, and now enters into eachand every crany of the social structure.The military order, once a slim establishment in a context of distrust fed bystate militia, has become the largest and most expensive feature of government,and, although well versed in smiling public relations, now has all the grim andclumsy efficiency of a sprawling bureaucratic domain.In each of these institutional areas, the means of power at the disposal ofdecision makers have increased enormously; their central executive powers havebeen enhanced; within each of them modern administrative routines have beenelaborated and tightened up.As each of these domains becomes enlarged and centralized, the consequences ofits activities become greater, and its traffic with the others increases. Thedecisions of a handful of corporations bear upon military and political as wellas upon economic developments around the world. The decisions of the militaryestablishment rest upon and grievously affect political life as well as the verylevel of economic activity. The decisions made within the political domaindetermine economic activities and military programs. There is no longer, on theone hand, an economy, and, on the other hand, a political order containing amilitary establishment unimportant to politics and to money-making. There is apolitical economy linked, in a thousand ways, with military institutions anddecisions. On each side of the world-split running through central Europe andaround the Asiatic rimlands, there is an ever-increasing interlocking ofeconomic, military, and political structures.2 [ch15_notes.html#ch1en2] If thereis government intervention in the corporate economy, so is there corporateintervention in the governmental process. In the structural sense, this triangleof power is the source of the interlocking directorate that is most importantfor the historical structure of the present.The fact of the interlocking is clearly revealed at each of the points of crisisof modern capitalist society—slump, war, and boom. In each, men of decision areled to an awareness of the interdependence of the major institutional orders. Inthe nineteenth century, when the scale of all institutions was smaller, theirliberal integration was achieved in the automatic economy, by an autonomous playof market forces, and in the automatic political domain, by the bargain and thevote. It was then assumed that out of the imbalance and friction that followedthe limited decisions then possible a new equilibrium would in due courseemerge. That can no longer be assumed, and it is not assumed by the men at thetop of each of the three dominant hierarchies.For given the scope of their consequences, decisions—and indecisions—in any oneof these ramify into the others, and hence top decisions tend either to becomeco-ordinated or to lead to a commanding indecision. It has not always been likethis. When numerous small entrepreneurs made up the economy, for example, manyof them could fail and the consequences still remain local; political andmilitary authorities did not intervene. But now, given political expectationsand military commitments, can they afford to allow key units of the privatecorporate economy to break down in slump? Increasingly, they do intervene ineconomic affairs, and as they do so, the controlling decisions in each order areinspected by agents of the other two, and economic, military, and politicalstructures are interlocked.At the pinnacle of each of the three enlarged and centralized domains, therehave arisen those higher circles which make up the economic, the political, andthe military elites. At the top of the economy, among the corporate rich, thereare the chief executives; at the top of the political order, the members of thepolitical directorate; at the top of the military establishment, the elite ofsoldier-statesmen clustered in and around the Joint Chiefs of Staff and theupper echelon. As each of these domains has coincided with the others, asdecisions tend to become total in their consequence, the leading men in each ofthe three domains of power—the warlords, the corporation chieftains, thepolitical directorate—tend to come together, to form the power elite of America.2The higher circles in and around these command posts are often thought of interms of what their members possess: they have a greater share than other peopleof the things and experiences that are most highly valued. From this point ofview, the elite are simply those who have the most of what there is to have,which is generally held to include money, power, and prestige—as well as all theways of life to which these lead.3 [ch15_notes.html#ch1en3] But the elite arenot simply those who have the most, for they could not ‘have the most’ were itnot for their positions in the great institutions. For such institutions are thenecessary bases of power, of wealth, and of prestige, and at the same time, thechief means of exercising power, of acquiring and retaining wealth, and ofcashing in the higher claims for prestige.By the powerful we mean, of course, those who are able to realize their will,even if others resist it. No one, accordingly, can be truly powerful unless hehas access to the command of major institutions, for it is over theseinstitutional means of power that the truly powerful are, in the first instance,powerful. Higher politicians and key officials of government command suchinstitutional power; so do admirals and generals, and so do the major owners andexecutives of the larger corporations. Not all power, it is true, is anchored inand exercised by means of such institutions, but only within and through themcan power be more or less continuous and important.Wealth also is acquired and held in and through institutions. The pyramid ofwealth cannot be understood merely in terms of the very rich; for the greatinheriting families, as we shall see, are now supplemented by the corporateinstitutions of modern society: every one of the very rich families has been andis closely connected—always legally and frequently managerially as well—with oneof the multi-million dollar corporations.The modern corporation is the prime source of wealth, but, in latter-daycapitalism, the political apparatus also opens and closes many avenues towealth. The amount as well as the source of income, the power over consumer’sgoods as well as over productive capital, are determined by position within thepolitical economy. If our interest in the very rich goes beyond their lavish ortheir miserly consumption, we must examine their relations to modern forms ofcorporate property as well as to the state; for such relations now determine thechances of men to secure big property and to receive high income.Great prestige increasingly follows the major institutional units of the socialstructure. It is obvious that prestige depends, often quite decisively, uponaccess to the publicity machines that are now a central and normal feature ofall the big institutions of modern America. Moreover, one feature of thesehierarchies of corporation, state, and military establishment is that their toppositions are increasingly interchangeable. One result of this is theaccumulative nature of prestige. Claims for prestige, for example, may beinitially based on military roles, then expressed in and augmented by aneducational institution run by corporate executives, and cashed in, finally, inthe political order, where, for General Eisenhower and those he represents,power and prestige finally meet at the very peak. Like wealth and power,prestige tends to be cumulative: the more of it you have, the more you can get.These values also tend to be translatable into one another: the wealthy find iteasier than the poor to gain power; those with status find it easier than thosewithout it to control opportunities for wealth.If we took the one hundred most powerful men in America, the one hundredwealthiest, and the one hundred most celebrated away from the institutionalpositions they now occupy, away from their resources of men and women and money,away from the media of mass communication that are now focused upon them—thenthey would be powerless and poor and uncelebrated. For power is not of a man.Wealth does not center in the person of the wealthy. Celebrity is not inherentin any personality. To be celebrated, to be wealthy, to have power requiresaccess to major institutions, for the institutional positions men occupydetermine in large part their chances to have and to hold these valuedexperiences.3The people of the higher circles may also be conceived as members of a topsocial stratum, as a set of groups whose members know one another, see oneanother socially and at business, and so, in making decisions, take one anotherinto account. The elite, according to this conception, feel themselves to be,and are felt by others to be, the inner circle of ‘the upper social classes.’4[ch15_notes.html#ch1en4] They form a more or less compact social andpsychological entity; they have become self-conscious members of a social class.People are either accepted into this class or they are not, and there is aqualitative split, rather than merely a numerical scale, separating them fromthose who are not elite. They are more or less aware of themselves as a socialclass and they behave toward one another differently from the way they do towardmembers of other classes. They accept one another, understand one another, marryone another, tend to work and to think if not together at least alike.Now, we do not want by our definition to prejudge whether the elite of thecommand posts are conscious members of such a socially recognized class, orwhether considerable proportions of the elite derive from such a clear anddistinct class. These are matters to be investigated. Yet in order to be able torecognize what we intend to investigate, we must note something that allbiographies and memoirs of the wealthy and the powerful and the eminent makeclear: no matter what else they may be, the people of these higher circles areinvolved in a set of overlapping ‘crowds’ and intricately connected ‘cliques.’There is a kind of mutual attraction among those who ‘sit on the sameterrace’—although this often becomes clear to them, as well as to others, onlyat the point at which they feel the need to draw the line; only when, in theircommon defense, they come to understand what they have in common, and so closetheir ranks against outsiders.The idea of such ruling stratum implies that most of its members have similarsocial origins, that throughout their lives they maintain a network of informalconnections, and that to some degree there is an interchangeability of positionbetween the various hierarchies of money and power and celebrity. We must, ofcourse, note at once that if such an elite stratum does exist, its socialvisibility and its form, for very solid historical reasons, are quite differentfrom those of the noble cousinhoods that once ruled various European nations.That American society has never passed through a feudal epoch is of decisiveimportance to the nature of the American elite, as well as to American societyas a historic whole. For it means that no nobility or aristocracy, establishedbefore the capitalist era, has stood in tense opposition to the higherbourgeoisie. It means that this bourgeoisie has monopolized not only wealth butprestige and power as well. It means that no set of noble families has commandedthe top positions and monopolized the values that are generally held in highesteem; and certainly that no set has done so explicitly by inherited right. Itmeans that no high church dignitaries or court nobilities, no entrenchedlandlords with honorific accouterments, no monopolists of high army posts haveopposed the enriched bourgeoisie and in the name of birth and prerogativesuccessfully resisted its self-making.But this does not mean that there are no upper strata in the United States. Thatthey emerged from a ‘middle class’ that had no recognized aristocratic superiorsdoes not mean they remained middle class when enormous increases in wealth madetheir own superiority possible. Their origins and their newness may have madethe upper strata less visible in America than elsewhere. But in America todaythere are in fact tiers and ranges of wealth and power of which people in themiddle and lower ranks know very little and may not even dream. There arefamilies who, in their well-being, are quite insulated from the economic joltsand lurches felt by the merely prosperous and those farther down the scale.There are also men of power who in quite small groups make decisions of enormousconsequence for the underlying population.The American elite entered modern history as a virtually unopposed bourgeoisie.No national bourgeoisie, before or since, has had such opportunities andadvantages. Having no military neighbors, they easily occupied an isolatedcontinent stocked with natural resources and immensely inviting to a willinglabor force. A framework of power and an ideology for its justification werealready at hand. Against mercantilist restriction, they inherited the principleof laissez-faire; against Southern planters, they imposed the principle ofindustrialism. The Revolutionary War put an end to colonial pretensions tonobility, as loyalists fled the country and many estates were broken up. TheJacksonian upheaval with its status revolution put an end to pretensions tomonopoly of descent by the old New England families. The Civil War broke thepower, and so in due course the prestige, of the ante-bellum South’s claimantsfor the higher esteem. The tempo of the whole capitalist development made itimpossible for an inherited nobility to develop and endure in America.No fixed ruling class, anchored in agrarian life and coming to flower inmilitary glory, could contain in America the historic thrust of commerce andindustry, or subordinate to itself the capitalist elite—as capitalists weresubordinated, for example, in Germany and Japan. Nor could such a ruling classanywhere in the world contain that of the United States when industrializedviolence came to decide history. Witness the fate of Germany and Japan in thetwo world wars of the twentieth century; and indeed the fate of Britain herselfand her model ruling class, as New York became the inevitable economic, andWashington the inevitable political capital of the western capitalist world.4The elite who occupy the command posts may be seen as the possessors of powerand wealth and celebrity; they may be seen as members of the upper stratum of acapitalistic society. They may also be defined in terms of psychological andmoral criteria, as certain kinds of selected individuals. So defined, the elite,quite simply, are people of superior character and energy.The humanist, for example, may conceive of the ‘elite’ not as a social level orcategory, but as a scatter of those individuals who attempt to transcendthemselves, and accordingly, are more noble, more efficient, made out of betterstuff. It does not matter whether they are poor or rich, whether they hold highposition or low, whether they are acclaimed or despised; they are elite becauseof the kind of individuals they are. The rest of the population is mass, which,according to this conception, sluggishly relaxes into uncomfortable mediocrity.5[ch15_notes.html#ch1en5]This is the sort of socially unlocated conception which some American writerswith conservative yearnings have recently sought to develop.*[page_14.html#pg14fn1a] But most moral and psychological conceptions of theelite are much less sophisticated, concerning themselves not with individualsbut with the stratum as a whole. Such ideas, in fact, always arise in a societyin which some people possess more than do others of what there is to possess.People with advantages are loath to believe that they just happen to be peoplewith advantages. They come readily to define themselves as inherently worthy ofwhat they possess; they come to believe themselves ‘naturally’ elite; and, infact, to imagine their possessions and their privileges as natural extensions oftheir own elite selves. In this sense, the idea of the elite as composed of menand women having a finer moral character is an ideology of the elite as aprivileged ruling stratum, and this is true whether the ideology is elite-madeor made up for it by others.In eras of equalitarian rhetoric, the more intelligent or the more articulateamong the lower and middle classes, as well as guilty members of the upper, maycome to entertain ideas of a counter-elite. In western society, as a matter offact, there is a long tradition and varied images of the poor, the exploited,and the oppressed as the truly virtuous, the wise, and the blessed. Stemmingfrom Christian tradition, this moral idea of a counter-elite, composed ofessentially higher types condemned to a lowly station, may be and has been usedby the underlying population to justify harsh criticism of ruling elites and tocelebrate utopian images of a new elite to come.The moral conception of the elite, however, is not always merely an ideology ofthe overprivileged or a counter-ideology of the underprivileged. It is often afact: having controlled experiences and select privileges, many individuals ofthe upper stratum do come in due course to approximate the types of characterthey claim to embody. Even when we give up—as we must—the idea that the eliteman or woman is born with an elite character, we need not dismiss the idea thattheir experiences and trainings develop in them characters of a specific type.Nowadays we must qualify the idea of elite as composed of higher types ofindividuals, for the men who are selected for and shaped by the top positionshave many spokesmen and advisers and ghosts and make-up men who modify theirself-conceptions and create their public images, as well as shape many of theirdecisions. There is, of course, considerable variation among the elite in thisrespect, but as a general rule in America today, it would be naive to interpretany major elite group merely in terms of its ostensible personnel. The Americanelite often seems less a collection of persons than of corporate entities, whichare in great part created and spoken for as standard types of ‘personality.’Even the most apparently free-lance celebrity is usually a sort of syntheticproduction turned out each week by a disciplined staff which systematicallyponders the effect of the easy ad-libbed gags the celebrity ‘spontaneously’echoes.Yet, in so far as the elite flourishes as a social class or as a set of men atthe command posts, it will select and form certain types of personality, andreject others. The kind of moral and psychological beings men become is in largepart determined by the values they experience and the institutional roles theyare allowed and expected to play. From the biographer’s point of view, a man ofthe upper classes is formed by his relations with others like himself in aseries of small intimate groupings through which he passes and to whichthroughout his lifetime he may return. So conceived, the elite is a set ofhigher circles whose members are selected, trained and certified and permittedintimate access to those who command the impersonal institutional hierarchies ofmodern society. If there is any one key to the psychological idea of the elite,it is that they combine in their persons an awareness of impersonaldecision-making with intimate sensibilities shared with one another. Tounderstand the elite as a social class we must examine a whole series of smallerface-to-face milieux, the most obvious of which, historically, has been theupper-class family, but the most important of which today are the propersecondary school and the metropolitan club.6 [ch15_notes.html#ch1en6]5These several notions of the elite, when appropriately understood, areintricately bound up with one another, and we shall use them all in thisexamination of American success. We shall study each of several higher circlesas offering candidates for the elite, and we shall do so in terms of the majorinstitutions making up the total society of America; within and between each ofthese institutions, we shall trace the interrelations of wealth and power andprestige. But our main concern is with the power of those who now occupy thecommand posts, and with the role which they are enacting in the history of ourepoch.Such an elite may be conceived as omnipotent, and its powers thought of as agreat hidden design. Thus, in vulgar Marxism, events and trends are explained byreference to ‘the will of the bourgeoisie’; in Nazism, by reference to ‘theconspiracy of the Jews’; by the petty right in America today, by reference to‘the hidden force’ of Communist spies. According to such notions of theomnipotent elite as historical cause, the elite is never an entirely visibleagency. It is, in fact, a secular substitute for the will of God, being realizedin a sort of providential design, except that usually non-elite men are thoughtcapable of opposing it and eventually overcoming it.* [page_16.html#pg16fn1a]The opposite view—of the elite as impotent—is now quite popular amongliberal-minded observers. Far from being omnipotent, the elites are thought tobe so scattered as to lack any coherence as a historical force. Theirinvisibility is not the invisibility of secrecy but the invisibility of themultitude. Those who occupy the formal places of authority are so check-mated—byother elites exerting pressure, or by the public as an electorate, or byconstitutional codes—that, although there may be upper classes, there is noruling class; although there may be men of power, there is no power elite;although there may be a system of stratification, it has no effective top. Inthe extreme, this view or the elite, as weakened by compromise and disunited tothe point of nullity, is a substitute for impersonal collective fate; for, inthis view, the decisions of the visible men of the higher circles do not countin history.* [page_17.html#pg17fn1a]Internationally, the image of the omnipotent elite tends to prevail. All goodevents and pleasing happenings are quickly imputed by the opinion-makers to theleaders of their own nation; all bad events and unpleasant experiences areimputed to the enemy abroad. In both cases, the omnipotence of evil rulers or ofvirtuous leaders is assumed. Within the nation, the use of such rhetoric israther more complicated: when men speak of the power of their own party orcircle, they and their leaders are, of course, impotent; only ‘the people’ areomnipotent. But, when they speak of the power of their opponent’s party orcircle, they impute to them omnipotence; ‘the people’ are now powerlessly takenin.More generally, American men of power tend, by convention, to deny that they arepowerful. No American runs for office in order to rule or even govern, but onlyto serve; he does not become a bureaucrat or even an official, but a publicservant. And nowadays, as I have already pointed out, such postures have becomestandard features of the public-relations programs of all men of power. So firma part of the style of power-wielding have they become that conservative writersreadily misinterpret them as indicating a trend toward an ‘amorphous powersituation.’But the ‘power situation’ of America today is less amorphous than is theperspective of those who see it as a romantic confusion. It is less a flat,momentary ‘situation’ than a graded, durable structure. And if those who occupyits top grades are not omnipotent, neither are they impotent. It is the form andthe height of the gradation of power that we must examine if we would understandthe degree of power held and exercised by the elite.If the power to decide such national issues as are decided were shared in anabsolutely equal way, there would be no power elite; in fact; there would be nogradation of power, but only a radical homogeneity. At the opposite extreme aswell, if the power to decide issues were absolutely monopolized by one smallgroup, there would be no gradation of power; there would simply be this smallgroup in command, and below it, the undifferentiated, dominated masses. Americansociety today represents neither the one nor the other of these extremes, but aconception of them is none the less useful: it makes us realize more clearly thequestion of the structure of power in the United States and the position of thepower elite within it.Within each of the most powerful institutional orders of modern society there isa gradation of power. The owner of a roadside fruit stand does not have as muchpower in any area of social or economic or political decision as the head of amulti-million-dollar fruit corporation; no lieutenant on the line is as powerfulas the Chief of Staff in the Pentagon; no deputy sheriff carries as muchauthority as the President of the United States. Accordingly, the problem ofdefining the power elite concerns the level at which we wish to draw the line.By lowering the line, we could define the elite out of existence; by raising it,we could make the elite a very small circle indeed. In a preliminary and minimumway, we draw the line crudely, in charcoal as it were: By the power elite, werefer to those political, economic, and military circles which as an intricateset of overlapping cliques share decisions having at least nationalconsequences. In so far as national events are decided, the power elite arethose who decide them.To say that there are obvious gradations of power and of opportunities to decidewithin modern society is not to say that the powerful are united, that theyfully know what they do, or that they are consciously joined in conspiracy. Suchissues are best faced if we concern ourselves, in the first instance, more withthe structural position of the high and mighty, and with the consequences oftheir decisions, than with the extent of their awareness or the purity of theirmotives. To understand the power elite, we must attend to three major keys:I. One, which we shall emphasize throughout our discussion of each of the highercircles, is the psychology of the several elites in their respective milieux. Inso far as the power elite is composed of men of similar origin and education, inso far as their careers and their styles of life are similar, there arepsychological and social bases for their unity, resting upon the fact that theyare of similar social type and leading to the fact of their easy intermingling.This kind of unity reaches its frothier apex in the sharing of that prestigethat is to be had in the world of the celebrity; it achieves a more solidculmination in the fact of the interchangeability of positions within andbetween the three dominant institutional orders.II. Behind such psychological and social unity as we may find, are the structureand the mechanics of those institutional hierarchies over which the politicaldirectorate, the corporate rich, and the high military now preside. The greaterthe scale of these bureaucratic domains, the greater the scope of theirrespective elite’s power. How each of the major hierarchies is shaped and andwhat relations it has with the other hierarchies determine in large part therelations of their rulers. If these hierarchies are scattered and disjointed;then their respective elites tend to be scattered and disjointed; if they havemany interconnections and points of coinciding interest, then their elites tendto form a coherent kind of grouping.The unity of the elite is not a simple reflection of the unity of institutions,but men and institutions are always related, and our conception of the powerelite invites us to determine that relation. Today in America there are severalimportant structural coincidences of interest between these institutionaldomains, including the development of a permanent war establishment by aprivately incorporated economy inside a political vacuum.III. The unity of the power elite, however, does not rest solely onpsychological similarity and social intermingling, nor entirely on thestructural coincidences of commanding positions and interests. At times it isthe unity of a more explicit co-ordination. To say that these three highercircles are increasingly co-ordinated, that this is one basis of their unity,and that at times—as during the wars—such co-ordination is quite decisive, isnot to say that the co-ordination is total or continuous, or even that it isvery surefooted. Much less is it to say that willful co-ordination is the soleor the major basis of their unity, or that the power elite has emerged as therealization of a plan. But it is to say that as the institutional mechanics ofour time have opened up avenues to men pursuing their several interests, many ofthem have come to see that these several interests could be realized more easilyif they worked together, in informal as well as in more formal ways, andaccordingly they have done so.6It is not my thesis that for all epochs of human history and in all nations, acreative minority, a ruling class, an omnipotent elite, shape all historicalevents. Such statements, upon careful examination, usually turn out to be meretautologies,7 [ch15_notes.html#ch1en7] and even when they are not, they are soentirely general as to be useless in the attempt to understand the history ofthe present. The minimum definition of the power elite as those who decidewhatever is decided of major consequence, does not imply that the members ofthis elite are always and necessarily the history-makers; neither does it implythat they never are. We must not confuse the conception of the elite, which wewish to define, with one theory about their role: that they are thehistory-makers of our time. To define the elite, for example, as ‘those who ruleAmerica’ is less to define a conception than to state one hypothesis about therole and power of that elite. No matter how we might define the elite, theextent of its members’ power is subject to historical variation. If, in adogmatic way, we try to include that variation in our generic definition, wefoolishly limit the use of a needed conception. If we insist that the elite bedefined as a strictly coordinated class that continually and absolutely rules,we are closing off from our view much to which the term more modestly definedmight open to our observation. In short, our definition of the power elitecannot properly contain dogma concerning the degree and kind of power thatruling groups everywhere have. Much less should it permit us to smuggle into ourdiscussion a theory of history.During most of human history, historical change has not been visible to thepeople who were involved in it, or even to those enacting it. Ancient Egypt andMesopotamia, for example, endured for some four hundred generations with butslight changes in their basic structure. That is six and a half times as long asthe entire Christian era, which has only prevailed some sixty generations; it isabout eighty times as long as the five generations of the United States’existence. But now the tempo of change is so rapid, and the means of observationso accessible, that the interplay of event and decision seems often to be quitehistorically visible, if we will only look carefully and from an adequatevantage point.When knowledgeable journalists tell us that ‘events, not men, shape the bigdecisions,’ they are echoing the theory of history as Fortune, Chance, Fate, orthe work of The Unseen Hand. For ‘events’ is merely a modern word for theseolder ideas, all of which separate men from history-making, because all of themlead us to believe that history goes on behind men’s backs. History is driftwith no mastery; within it there is action but no deed; history is merehappening and the event intended by no one.8 [ch15_notes.html#ch1en8]The course of events in our time depends more on a series of human decisionsthan on any inevitable fate. The sociological meaning of ‘fate’ is simply this:that, when the decisions are innumerable and each one is of small consequence,all of them add up in a way no man intended—to history as fate. But not allepochs are equally fateful. As the circle of those who decide is narrowed, asthe means of decision are centralized and the consequences of decisions becomeenormous, then the course of great events often rests upon the decisions ofdeterminable circles. This does not necessarily mean that the same circle of menfollow through from one event to another in such a way that all of history ismerely their plot. The power of the elite does not necessarily mean that historyis not also shaped by a series of small decisions, none of which are thoughtout. It does not mean that a hundred small arrangements and compromises andadaptations may not be built into the going policy and the living event. Theidea of the power elite implies nothing about the process of decision-making assuch: it is an attempt to delimit the social areas within which that process,whatever its character, goes on. It is a conception of who is involved in theprocess.The degree of foresight and control of those who are involved in decisions thatcount may also vary. The idea of the power elite does not mean that theestimations and calculated risks upon which decisions are made are not oftenwrong and that the consequences are sometimes, indeed often, not those intended.Often those who make decisions are trapped by their own inadequacies and blindedby their own errors.Yet in our time the pivotal moment does arise, and at that moment, small circlesdo decide or fail to decide. In either case, they are an elite of power. Thedropping of the A-bombs over Japan was such a moment; the decision on Korea wassuch a moment; the confusion about Quemoy and Matsu, as well as beforeDienbienphu were such moments; the sequence of maneuvers which involved theUnited States in World War II was such a ‘moment.’ Is it not true that much ofthe history of our times is composed of such moments? And is not that what ismeant when it is said that we live in a time of big decisions, of decisivelycentralized power?Most of us do not try to make sense of our age by believing in a Greek-like,eternal recurrence, nor by a Christian belief in a salvation to come, nor by anysteady march of human progress. Even though we do not reflect upon such matters,the chances are we believe with Burckhardt that we live in a mere succession ofevents; that sheer continuity is the only principle of history. History ismerely one thing after another; history is meaningless in that it is not therealization of any determinate plot. It is true, of course, that our sense ofcontinuity, our feeling for the history of our time, is affected by crisis. Butwe seldom look beyond the immediate crisis or the crisis felt to be just ahead.We believe neither in fate nor providence; and we assume, without talking aboutit, that ‘we’—as a nation—can decisively shape the future but that ‘we’ asindividuals somehow cannot do so.Any meaning history has, ‘we’ shall have to give to it by our actions. Yet thefact is that although we are all of us within history we do not all possessequal powers to make history. To pretend that we do is sociological nonsense andpolitical irresponsibility. It is nonsense because any group or any individualis limited, first of all, by the technical and institutional means of power atits command; we do not all have equal access to the means of power that nowexist, nor equal influence over their use. To pretend that ‘we’ are allhistory-makers is politically irresponsible because it obfuscates any attempt tolocate responsibility for the consequential decisions of men who do have accessto the means of power.From even the most superficial examination of the history of the western societywe learn that the power of decision-makers is first of all limited by the levelof technique, by the means of power and violence and organization that prevailin a given society. In this connection we also learn that there is a fairlystraight line running upward through the history of the West; that the means ofoppression and exploitation, of violence and destruction, as well as the meansof production and reconstruction, have been progressively enlarged andincreasingly centralized.As the institutional means of power and the means of communications that tiethem together have become steadily more efficient, those now in command of themhave come into command of instruments of rule quite unsurpassed in the historyof mankind. And we are not yet at the climax of their development. We can nolonger lean upon or take soft comfort from the historical ups and downs ofruling groups of previous epochs. In that sense, Hegel is correct: we learn fromhistory that we cannot learn from it.For every epoch and for every social structure, we must work out an answer tothe question of the power of the elite. The ends of men are often merely hopes,but means are facts within some men’s control. That is why all means of powertend to become ends to an elite that is in command of them. And that is why wemay define the power elite in terms of the means of power—as those who occupythe command posts. The major questions about the American elite today—itscomposition, its unity, its power—must now be faced with due attention to theawesome means of power available to them. Caesar could do less with Rome thanNapoleon with France; Napoleon less with France than Lenin with Russia; andLenin less with Russia than Hitler with Germany. But what was Caesar’s power atits peak compared with the power of the changing inner circle of Soviet Russiaor of America’s temporary administrations? The men of either circle can causegreat cities to be wiped out in a single night, and in a few weeks turncontinents into thermonuclear wastelands. That the facilities of power areenormously enlarged and decisively centralized means that the decisions of smallgroups are now more consequential.But to know that the top posts of modern social structures now permit morecommanding decisions is not to know that the elite who occupy these posts arethe history-makers. We might grant that the enlarged and integrated economic,military, and political structures are shaped to permit command decisions, yetstill feel that, as it were, ‘they run themselves,’ that those who are on top,in short, are determined in their decisions by ‘necessity,’ which presumablymeans by the instituted roles that they play and the situation of theseinstitutions in the total structure of society.Do the elite determine the roles that they enact? Or do the roles thatinstitutions make available to them determine the power of the elite? Thegeneral answer—and no general answer is sufficient—is that in different kinds ofstructures and epochs elites are quite differently related to the roles thatthey play: nothing in the nature of the elite or in the nature of historydictates an answer. It is also true that if most men and women take whateverroles are permitted to them and enact them as they are expected to by virtue oftheir position, this is precisely what the elite need not do, and often do notdo. They may call into question the structure, their position within it, or theway in which they are to enact that position.Nobody called for or permitted Napoleon to chase Parlement home on the 18Brumaire, and later to transform his consulate into an emperorship.9[ch15_notes.html#ch1en9] Nobody called for or permitted Adolf Hitler to proclaimhimself ‘Leader and Chancellor’ the day President Hindenburg died, to abolishand usurp roles by merging the presidency and the chancellorship. Nobody calledfor or permitted Franklin D. Roosevelt to make the series of decisions that ledto the entrance of the United States into World War II. It was no ‘historicalnecessity,’ but a man named Truman who, with a few other men, decided to drop abomb on Hiroshima. It was no historical necessity, but an argument within asmall circle of men that defeated Admiral Radford’s proposal to bomb troopsbefore Dienbienphu. Far from being dependent upon the structure of institutions,modern elites may smash one structure and set up another in which they thenenact quite different roles. In fact, such destruction and creation ofinstitutional structures, with all their means of power, when events seem toturn out well, is just what is involved in ‘great leadership,’ or, when theyseem to turn out badly, great tyranny.Some elite men are, of course, typically role-determined, but others are attimes role-determining. They determine not only the role they play but today theroles of millions of other men. The creation of pivotal roles and their pivotalenactment occurs most readily when social structures are undergoing epochaltransitions. It is clear that the international development of the United Statesto one of the two ‘great powers’—along with the new means of annihilation andadministrative and psychic domination—have made of the United States in themiddle years of the twentieth century precisely such an epochal pivot.There is nothing about history that tells us that a power elite cannot make it.To be sure, the will of such men is always limited, but never before have thelimits been so broad, for never before have the means of power been so enormous.It is this that makes our situation so precarious, and makes even more importantan understanding of the powers and the limitations of the American elite. Theproblem of the nature and the power of this elite is now the only realistic andserious way to raise again the problem of responsible government.7Those who have abandoned criticism for the new American celebration take readilyto the view that the elite is impotent. If they were politically serious, theyought, on the basis of their view, to say to those presumably in charge ofAmerican policy:10 [ch15_notes.html#ch1en10]‘One day soon, you may believe that you have an opportunity to drop a bomb or achance to exacerbate further your relations with allies or with the Russians whomight also drop it. But don’t be so foolish as to believe that you really have achoice. You have neither choice nor chance. The whole Complex Situation of whichyou are merely one balancing part is the result of Economic and Social Forces,and so will be the fateful outcome. So stand by quietly, like Tolstoy’s general,and let events proceed. Even if you did act, the consequences would not be whatyou intended, even if you had an intention.‘But—if events come out well, talk as though you had decided. For then men havehad moral choices and the power to make them and are, of course, responsible.‘If events come out badly, say that you didn’t have the real choice, and are, ofcourse, not accountable: they, the others, had the choice and they areresponsible. You can get away with this even though you have at your commandhalf the world’s forces and God knows how many bombs and bombers. For you are,in fact, an impotent item in the historical fate of your times; and moralresponsibility is an illusion, although it is of great use if handled in areally alert public relations manner.’The one implication that can be drawn from all such fatalisms is that if fortuneor providence rules, then no elite of power can be justly considered a source ofhistorical decisions, and the idea—much less the demand—of responsibleleadership is an idle and an irresponsible notion. For clearly, an impotentelite, the plaything of history, cannot be held accountable. If the elite of ourtime do not have power, they cannot be held responsible; as men in a difficultposition, they should engage our sympathies. The people of the United States areruled by sovereign fortune; they, and with them their elite, are fatallyoverwhelmed by consequences they cannot control. If that is so, we ought all todo what many have in fact already done: withdraw entirely from politicalreflection and action into a materially comfortable and entirely private life.If, on the other hand, we believe that war and peace and slump and prosperityare, precisely now, no longer matters of ‘fortune’ or ‘fate,’ but that,precisely now more than ever, they are controllable, then we mustask—controllable by whom? The answer must be: By whom else but those who nowcommand the enormously enlarged and decisively centralized means of decision andpower? We may then ask: Why don’t they, then? And for the answer to that, wemust understand the context and the character of the American elite today.There is nothing in the idea of the elite as impotent which should deter us fromasking just such questions, which are now the most important questions politicalmen can ask. The American elite is neither omnipotent nor impotent. These areabstract absolutes used publicly by spokesmen, as excuses or as boasts, but interms of which we may seek to clarify the political issues before us, which justnow are above all the issues of responsible power.There is nothing in ‘the nature of history’ in our epoch that rules out thepivotal function of small groups of decision-makers. On the contrary, thestructure of the present is such as to make this not only a reasonable, but arather compelling, view.There is nothing in ‘the psychology of man,’ or in the social manner by whichmen are shaped and selected for and by the command posts of modern society, thatmakes unreasonable the view that they do confront choices and that the choicesthey make—or their failure to confront them—are history-making in theirconsequences.Accordingly, political men now have every reason to hold the American powerelite accountable for a decisive range of the historical events that make up thehistory of the present.It is as fashionable, just now, to suppose that there is no power elite, as itwas fashionable in the ‘thirties to suppose a set of ruling-class villains to bethe source of all social injustice and public malaise. I should be as far fromsupposing that some simple and unilateral ruling class could be firmly locatedas the prime mover of American society, as I should be from supposing that allhistorical change in America today is merely impersonal drift.The view that all is blind drift is largely a fatalist projection of one’s ownfeeling of impotence and perhaps, if one has ever been active politically in aprincipled way, a salve of one’s guilt.The view that all of history is due to the conspiracy of an easily located setof villains, or of heroes, is also a hurried projection from the difficulteffort to understand how shifts in the structure of society open opportunitiesto various elites and how various elites take advantage or fail to takeadvantage of them. To accept either view—of all history as conspiracy or of allhistory as drift—is to relax the effort to understand the facts of power and theways of the powerful.8In my attempt to discern the shape of the power elite of our time, and thus togive a responsible meaning to the anonymous ‘They,’ which the underlyingpopulation opposes to the anonymous ‘We,’ I shall begin by briefly examining thehigher elements which most people know best: the new and the old upper classesof local society and the metropolitan 400. I shall then outline the world of thecelebrity, attempting to show that the prestige system of American society hasnow for the first time become truly national in scope; and that the more trivialand glamorous aspects of this national system of status tend at once to distractattention from its more authoritarian features and to justify the power that itoften conceals.In examining the very rich and the chief executives, I shall indicate howneither ‘America’s Sixty Families’ nor ‘The Managerial Revolution’ provides anadequate idea of the transformation of the upper classes as they are organizedtoday in the privileged stratum of the corporate rich.After describing the American statesman as a historical type, I shall attempt toshow that what observers in the Progressive Era called ‘the invisiblegovernment’ has now become quite visible; and that what is usually taken to bethe central content of politics, the pressures and the campaigns and thecongressional maneuvering, has, in considerable part, now been relegated to themiddle levels of power.In discussing the military ascendancy, I shall try to make clear how it has comeabout that admirals and generals have assumed positions of decisive politicaland economic relevance, and how, in doing so, they have found many points ofcoinciding interests with the corporate rich and the political directorate ofthe visible government.After these and other trends are made as plain as I can make them, I shallreturn to the master problems of the power elite, as well as take up thecomplementary notion of the mass society.What I am asserting is that in this particular epoch a conjunction of historicalcircumstances has led to the rise of an elite of power; that the men of thecircles composing this elite, severally and collectively, now make such keydecisions as are made; and that, given the enlargement and the centralization ofthe means of power now available, the decisions that they make and fail to makecarry more consequences for more people than has ever been the case in the worldhistory of mankind.I am also asserting that there has developed on the middle levels of power, asemi-organized stalemate, and that on the bottom level there has come into beinga mass-like society which has little resemblence to the image of a society inwhich voluntary associations and classic publics hold the keys to power. The topof the American system of power is much more unified and much more powerful, thebottom is much more fragmented, and in truth, impotent, than is generallysupposed by those who are distracted by the middling units of power whichneither express such will as exists at the bottom nor determine the decisions atthe top."},{"pageContent":"2LOCAL SOCIETYIN every town and small city of America an upper set of families stands abovethe middle classes and towers over the underlying population of clerks and wageworkers. The members of this set possess more than do others of whatever thereis locally to possess; they hold the keys to local decision; their names andfaces are often printed in the local paper; in fact, they own the newspaper aswell as the radio station; they also own the three important local plants andmost of the commercial properties along the main street; they direct the banks.Mingling closely with one another, they are quite conscious of the fact thatthey belong to the leading class of the leading families.All their sons and daughters go to college, often after private schools; thenthey marry one another, or other boys and girls from similar families in similartowns. After they are well married, they come to possess, to occupy, to decide.The son of one of these old families, to his father’s chagrin and hisgrandfather’s fury, is now an executive in the local branch of a nationalcorporation. The leading family doctor has two sons, one of whom now takes upthe practice; the other—who is soon to marry the daughter of the second largestfactory—will probably be the next district attorney. So it has traditionallybeen, and so it is today in the small towns of America.Class consciousness is not equally characteristic of all levels of Americansociety: it is most apparent in the upper class. Among the underlying populationeverywhere in America there is much confusion and blurring of the lines ofdemarcation, of the status value of clothing and houses, of the ways ofmoney-making and of money-spending. The people of the lower and middle classesare of course differentiated by the values, things, and experiences to whichdiffering amounts of income lead, but often they are aware neither of thesevalues nor of their class bases.Those of the upper strata, on the other hand, if only because they are fewer innumber, are able with much more ease to know more about one another, to maintainamong themselves a common tradition, and thus to be conscious of their own kind.They have the money and the time required to uphold their common standards. Apropertied class, they are also a more or less distinct set of people who,mingling with one another, form compact circles with common claims torecognition as the leading families of their cities.1Examining the small city, both the novelist and the sociologist have felt mostclearly the drama of the old and the new upper classes. The struggle for statuswhich they have observed going on in these towns may be seen on a historic scalein the modern course of the whole of Western Society; for centuries theparvenues and snobs of new upper classes have stood in tension with the ‘oldguard.’ There are, of course, regional variations but across the country thesmall-town rich are surprisingly standardized. In these cities today, two typesof upper classes prevail, one composed of rentier and socially older families,the other of newer families which, economically and socially, are of a moreentrepreneurial type. Members of these two top classes understand the severaldistinctions between them, although each has its own particular view of them.1[ch15_notes.html#ch2en1]It should not be supposed that the old upper class is necessarily ‘higher’ thanthe new, or that the new is simply a nouveau riche, struggling to drape new-wonwealth in the prestige garments worn so easily by the old. The new upper classhas a style of life of its own, and although its members—especially thewomen—borrow considerably from the old upper-class style, they also—especiallythe men—debunk that style in the name of their own values and aspirations. Inmany ways, these two upper sets compete for prestige and their competitioninvolves some mutual deflation of claims for merit.The old upper-class person feels that his prestige originates in time itself.‘Somewhere in the past,’ he seems to say, ‘my Original Ancestor rose up tobecome the Founder Of This Local Family Line and now His Blood flows in myveins. I am what My Family has been, and My Family has always been among thevery best people.’ In New England and in the South, more families than in otherregions are acutely conscious of family lines and old residence, and moreresistant to the social ascendancy of the newly rich and the newly arrived.There is perhaps a stronger and more embracing sense of family, which,especially in the South, comes to include long faithful servants as well asgrandchildren. The sense of kinship may be extended even to those who, althoughnot related by marriage or blood, are considered as ‘cousins’ or ‘aunts’ becausethey ‘grew up with mother.’ Old upper-class families thus tend to form anendogenous cousinhood, whose clan piety and sense of kinship lead to a reverencefor the past and often to a cultivated interest in the history of the region inwhich the clan has for so long played such an honorable role.To speak of ‘old families’ is of course to speak of ‘wealthy old families,’ butin the status world of the old upper class, ready money and property are simplyassumed—and then played down: ‘Of course, you have to have enough of thisworld’s goods to stand the cost of keeping up, of entertaining and for churchdonations … but social standing is more than money.’ The men and women of theold upper class generally consider money in a negative way—as something in whichthe new upper-class people are too closely interested. ‘I’m sorry to say thatour larger industrialists are increasingly money-conscious,’ they say, and insaying it, they have in mind the older generation of industrialists who are nowretired, generally on real-estate holdings; these rich men and their women folk,the old upper class believes, were and are more interested in ‘community andsocial’ qualifications than in mere money.One major theme in old upper-class discussions of smaller business people isthat they made a great deal of money during the late war, but that socially theyaren’t to be allowed to count. Another theme concerns the less respectable waysin which the money of the newly moneyed people has been earned. They mentionpin-ball concessionaires, tavern keepers, and people in the trucking lines. And,having patronized them, they are quite aware of the wartime black markets.The continuance of the old-family line as the basis of prestige is challenged bythe ripsnorting style as well as the money of the new upper classes, which WorldWar II expanded and enriched, and made socially bold. Their style, the old upperclasses feel, is replacing the older, quieter one. Underlying this statustension, there is often a tendency of decline in the economic basis of many oldupper-class families, which, in many towns, is mainly real estate. Yet the oldupper class still generally has its firm hold on local financial institutions:in the market centers of Georgia and Nebraska, the trading and manufacturingtowns of Vermont and California—the old upper-class banker is usually the lordof his community’s domain, lending prestige to the businessmen with whom heassociates, naming The Church by merely belonging to it. Thus embodyingsalvation, social standing and financial soundness, he is accepted by others athis own shrewd and able valuation.In the South the tension between old and new upper classes is often moredramatic than in other regions, for here old families have been based on landownership and the agricultural economy. The synthesis of new wealth with olderstatus, which of course has been under way since the Civil War, has beenaccelerated since the slump and World War II. The old southern aristocracy, infictional image and in researched fact, is indeed often in a sorry state ofdecline. If it does not join the rising class based on industry and trade, itwill surely die out, for when given sufficient time if status does not remainwealthy it crumbles into ignored eccentricity. Without sufficient money, quietdignity and self-satisfied withdrawal comes to seem mere decay and evendecadence.The emphasis upon family descent, coupled with withdrawal, tends to enhance thestatus of older people, especially of those older women who become dowagerjudges of the conduct of the young. Such a situation is not conducive to themarriage of old upper-class daughters to sons of a new but up-and-coming classof wealth. Yet the industrialization of the smaller cities steadily breaks upold status formations and leads to new ones: the rise of the enrichedindustrialist and tradesman inevitably leads to the decline of the land-owningaristocracy. In the South, as well as elsewhere, the larger requirements ofcapital for agricultural endeavor on sufficient scale, as well as favorabletaxation and subsidy for ‘farmers,’ lead to new upper-class formations on theland as in the city.The new and the old upper classes thus stand in the smaller cities eyeing oneanother with considerable tension, with some disdain, and with begrudgingadmiration. The upper-class man sees the old as having a prestige which he wouldlike to have, but also as an old fogy blocking important business and politicaltraffic and as a provincial, bound to the local set-up, without the vision toget up and go. The old upper-class man, in turn, eyes the new and thinks of himas too money-conscious, as having made money and as grabbing for more, but asnot having acquired the social background or the style of cultured lifebefitting his financial rank, and as not really being interested in the civiclife of the city, except in so far as he might use it for personal and alienends.When they come up against the prestige of the old upper class on business and oncivic and political issues, the new upper-class men often translate thatprestige into ‘old age,’ which is associated in their minds with the quiet,‘old-fashioned’ manner, the slower civic tempo, and the dragging political viewsof the old upper class. They feel that the old upper-class people do not usetheir prestige to make money in the manner of the new upper class. They do notunderstand old prestige as something to be enjoyed; they see it in its politicaland economic relevance: when they do not have it, it is something standing intheir way.* [page_34.html#pg34fn1a]2That the social and economic split of the upper classes is also a politicalsplit is not yet fully apparent in all localities, but it is a fact that hastended to become national since World War II.Local upper classes—new and old, seen and unseen, active and passive—make up thesocial backbone of the Republican party. Members of the old upper class,however, do not seem as strident or as active politically in the postwar sceneas do many of the new. Perhaps it is because they do not feel able, as AllisonDavis and others have suggested of the old southern upper classes, ‘to lessenthe social distance between themselves and the voters.’ Of course, everywheretheir social position ‘is clearly recognized by the officials. They are freefrom many of the minor legal restrictions, are almost never arrested fordrunkenness or for minor traffic violations, are seldom called for jury duty,and usually receive any favors they request.’2 [ch15_notes.html#ch2en2] Theyare, it is true, very much concerned with tax rates and property assessments,but these concerns, being fully shared by the new upper classes, are well servedwithout the personal intervention of the old.The new upper class often practices those noisy political emotions and statusfrustrations which, on a national scale and in extreme form, have been soreadily observable in The Investigators. The key to these political emotions, inthe Congress as in the local society, lies in the status psychology of thenouveau riche* [page_35.html#pg35fn1a] Such newly enriched classes—ranging fromTexas multi-millionaires to petty Illinois war profiteers who have sinceconsolidated their holdings—feel that they are somehow held down by the statuspretensions of older wealth and older families. The suddenly $30,000-a-yearinsurance salesmen who drive the 260 hp cars and guiltily buy vulgar diamondrings for their wives; the suddenly $60,000-a-year businessmen who put in50-foot swimming pools and do not know how to act toward their new servants—theyfeel that they have achieved something and yet are not thought to be good enoughto possess it fully. There are men in Texas today whose names are strictlylocal, but who have more money than many nationally prominent families of theEast. But they are not often nationally prominent, and even when they are, it isnot in just the same way.Such feelings exist, on a smaller scale, in virtually every smaller city andtown. They are not always articulated, and certainly they have not become thebases of any real political movement. But they lie back of the wide and deepgratification at beholding men of established prestige ‘told off,’ observing thegeneral reprimanded by the upstart, hearing the parvenu familiarly, eveninsultingly, call the old wealthy by their first names in public controversy.The political aim of the petty right formed among the new upper classes of thesmall cities is the destruction of the legislative achievements of the New andFair Deals. Moreover, the rise of labor unions in many of these cities duringthe war, with more labor leaders clamoring to be on local civic boards; theincreased security of the wage workers who during the war cashed larger weeklychecks in stores and banks and crowded the sidewalks on Saturday; the big newautomobiles of the small people—all these class changes of the last two decadespsychologically threaten the new upper cass by reducing their own feelings ofsignificance, their own sense of a fit order of prestige.The old upper classes are also made less socially secure by such goings on inthe street, in the stores, and in the bank; but after all, they reason: ‘Thesepeople do not really touch us. All they have is money.’ The newly rich, however,being less socially firm than the old, do feel themselves to be of lesser worthas they see others also rise in the economic worlds of the small cities.Local society is a structure of power as well as a hierarchy of status; at itstop there is a set of cliques or ‘crowds’ whose members judge and decide theimportant community issues, as well as many larger issues of state and nation inwhich ‘the community’ is involved.3 [ch15_notes.html#ch2en3] Usually, althoughby no means always, these cliques are composed of old upper-class people; theyinclude the larger businessmen and those who control the banks who usually alsohave connections with the major real-estate holders. Informally organized, thesecliques are often each centered in the several economic functions: there is anindustrial, a retailing, a banking clique. The cliques overlap, and there areusually some men who, moving from one to another, co-ordinate viewpoints anddecisions. There are also the lawyers and administrators of the solid rentierfamilies, who, by the power of proxy and by the many contacts between old andnew wealth they embody, tie together and focus in decision the power of money,of credit, of organization.Immediately below such cliques are the hustlers, largely of new upper-classstatus, who carry out the decisions and programs of the top—sometimesanticipating them and always trying to do so. Here are the ‘operations’ men—thevice-presidents of the banks, successful small businessmen, the ranking publicofficials, contractors, and executives of local industries. This number twolevel shades off into the third string men—the heads of civic agencies,organization officials, the pettier civic leaders, newspaper men, and, finally,into the fourth order of the power hierarchy—the rank and file of theprofessional and business strata, the ministers, the leading teachers, socialworkers, personnel directors.On almost any given topic of interest or decision, some top clique, or even someone key man, becomes strategic to the decision at hand and to the informalco-ordination of its support among the important cliques. Now it is the man whois the clique’s liaison with the state governor; now it is the bankers’ clique;now it is the man who is well liked by the rank and file of both Rotary Club andChamber of Commerce, both Community Chest and Bar Association.Power does not reside in these middle-level organizations; key decisions are notmade by their membership. Top men belong to them, but are only infrequentlyactive in them. As associations, they help put into effect the policy-lineworked out by the higher circles of power; they are training grounds in whichyounger hustlers of the top prove themselves; and sometimes, especially in thesmaller cities, they are recruiting grounds for new members of the top.‘We would not go to the “associations,” as you call them—that is, not rightaway,’ one powerful man of a sizable city in the mid-South told Professor FloydHunter. ‘A lot of those associations, if you mean by associations the Chamber ofCommerce or the Community Council, sit around and discuss “goals” and “ideals.”I don’t know what a lot of those things mean. I’ll be frank with you, I do notget onto a lot of those committees. A lot of the others in town do, but I don’t…Charles Homer is the biggest man in our crowd … When he gets an idea, otherswill get the idea… recently he got the idea that Regional City should be thenational headquarters for an International Trade Council. He called in some ofus [the inner crowd], and he talked briefly about his idea. He did not talkmuch. We do not engage in loose talk about the “ideals” of the situation and allthat other stuff. We get right down to the problem, that is, how to get thisCouncil. We all think it is a good idea right around the circle. There are sixof us in the meeting … All of us are assigned tasks to carry out. Moster is todraw up the papers of incorporation. He is the lawyer. I have a group of friendsthat I will carry along. Everyone else has a group of friends he will do thesame with. These fellows are what you might call followers.‘We decide we need to raise $65,000 to put this thing over. We could raise thatamount within our own crowd, but eventually this thing is going to be acommunity proposition, so we decide to bring the other crowds in on the deal. Wedecide to have a meeting at the Grandview Club with select members of othercrowds … When we meet at the Club at dinner with the other crowds, Mr. Homermakes a brief talk; again, he does not need to talk long. He ends his talk bysaying he believes in his proposition enough that he is willing to put $10,000of his own money into it for the first year. He sits down. You can see some ofthe other crowds getting their heads together, and the Growers Bank crowd, notto be outdone, offers a like amount plus a guarantee that they will go alongwith the project for three years. Others throw in $5,000 to $10,000 until—I’dsay within thirty or forty minutes—we have pledges of the money we need. Inthree hours the whole thing is settled, including the time for eating!There is one detail I left out, and it is an important one. We went into thatmeeting with a board of directors picked. The constitution was all written, andthe man who was to head the council as executive was named … a third-string man,a fellow who will take advice … The public doesn’t know anything about theproject until it reaches the stage I’ve been talking about. After the matter isfinancially sound, then we go to the newspapers and say there is a proposal forconsideration. Of course, it is not news to a lot of people by then, but theChamber committees and other civic organizations are brought in on the idea.They all think it’s a good idea. They help to get the Council located andestablished. That’s about all there is to it.’4 [ch15_notes.html#ch2en4]3The status drama of the old and the new upper class; the class structure thatunderpins that drama; the power system of the higher cliques—these now form therather standard, if somewhat intricate, pattern of the upper levels of localsociety. But we could not understand that pattern or what is happening to it,were we to forget that all these cities are very much part of a national systemof status and power and wealth. Despite the loyal rhetoric practiced by manyCongressional spokesmen, no local society is in truth a sovereign locality.During the past century, local society has become part of a national economy;its status and power hierarchies have come to be subordinate parts of the largerhierarchies of the nation. Even as early as the decades after the Civil War,persons of local eminence were becoming—merely local.5 [ch15_notes.html#ch2en5]Men whose sphere of active decision and public acclaim was regional and nationalin scope were rising into view. Today, to remain merely local is to fail; it isto be overshadowed by the wealth, the power, and the status of nationallyimportant men. To succeed is to leave local society behind—althoughcertification by it may be needed in order to be selected for national cliques.All truly old ways in America are, of course, rural. Yet the value of ruralorigin and of rural residences is sometimes ambiguous. On the one hand, there isthe tradition of the town against the hayseed, of the big city against thesmall-town hick, and in many smaller cities, some prestige is achieved by thosewho, unlike the lower, working classes, have been in the city for all of onegeneration. On the other hand, men who have achieved eminence often boast of thesolidity of their rural origin; which may be due to the Jeffersonian ethos whichholds rural virtues to be higher than the ways of the city, or to the desire toshow how very far one has come.If, in public life, the farm is often a good place to have come from, in sociallife, it is always a good place to own and to visit. Both small-city andbig-city upper classes now quite typically own and visit their ‘places in thecountry.’ In part, all this, which even in the Middle West began as far back asthe eighteen-nineties, is a way by which the merely rich attempt to anchorthemselves in what is old and esteemed, of proving with cash and loving care andsometimes with inconvenience, their reverence for the past. So in the Souththere is the exactly restored Old Plantation Mansion, in Texas and Californiathe huge cattle spread or the manicured fruit ranch, in Iowa the model farm withits purebred stock and magnificent barns. There is also the motive of buying thefarm as an investment and as a tax evasion, as well as, of course, the pleasureof such a seasonable residence and hobby.For the small town and the surrounding countryside, these facts mean that localstatus arrangements can no longer be strictly local. Small town and countrysideare already pretty well consolidated, for wealthy farmers, especially uponretiring, often move into the small city, and wealthy urban families have boughtmuch country land. In one middle-western community, Mr. Hollingshead hasreported, some twenty-five families of pioneer ancestry have accumulated morethan sixty per cent of the surrounding one hundred sixty square miles of richagricultural land.6 [ch15_notes.html#ch2en6] Such concentration has beenstrengthened by marriages between rural and urban upper-class families. Locally,any ‘rural aristocracy’ that may prevail is already centered in at least thesmall city; rural upper classes and the local society of smaller cities are inclose contact, often in fact, belonging to the same higher cousinhood.In addition to the farms owned by city families and the town-centered activitiesand residences of rural families, there is the increased seasonal change ofresidence among both rural and small-town upper classes. The women and childrenof the rural upper classes go to ‘the lake’ for the summer period, and the menfor long week ends, even as New York families do the same in the winters inFlorida. The democratization of the seasonable vacation to coast, mountain, orisland now extends to local upper classes of small cities and rural district,where thirty years ago it was more confined to metropolitan upper classes.The connections of small town with countryside, and the centering of the statusworlds of both upon the larger city, are most dramatically revealed when intothe country surrounding a small town there moves a set of gentlemen farmers.These seasonal residents are involved in the conduct and values of the largercities in which they live; they know nothing and often care less for localclaims to eminence. With their country estates, they come to occupy the top rungof what used to be called the farm ladder, although they know little or nothingof the lower rungs of that ladder. In one middle-western township studied byEvon Vogt, such urban groups own half the land.7 [ch15_notes.html#ch2en7] Theydo not seek connections with local society and often do not even welcome itsadvances, but they are passing on these country estates to their children andnow even to their grandchildren.The members of local society, rural and urban, can attempt to follow one of twocourses: they can withdraw and try to debunk the immoral ways of the newcomers,or they can attempt to join them, in which case they too will come to focustheir social ways of life upon the metropolitan area. But whichever course theyelect, they soon come to know, often with bitterness, that the new upper classas well as the local upper-middle classes, among whom they once cashed in theirclaims for status, are watching them with close attention and sometimes withamusement. What was once a little principality, a seemingly self-sufficientworld of status, is becoming an occasionally used satellite of the big-cityupper class.What has been happening in and to local society is its consolidation with thesurrounding rural area, and its gradual incorporation in a national system ofpower and status. Muncie, Indiana, is now much closer to Indianapolis andChicago than it was fifty years ago; and the upper classes of Muncie travelfarther and travel more frequently than do the local middle and lower classes.There are few small towns today whose upper classes, both new and old, are notlikely to visit a near-by large city at least every month or so. Such travel isnow a standard operation of the business, educational, and social life of thesmall-city rich. They have more friends at a distance and more frequentrelations with them. The world of the local upper-class person is simply largerthan it was in 1900 and larger than the worlds of the middle and lower classestoday.It is to the metropolitan upper classes that the local society of the smallercities looks; its newer members with open admiration, its older, with less openadmiration. What good is it to show a horse or a dog in a small city of 100,000population, even if you could, when you know that The Show will be in New Yorknext fall? More seriously, what prestige is there in a $50,000 local deal,however financially convenient, when you know that in Chicago, only 175 milesaway, men are turning over $500,000? The very broadening of their status areamakes the small-town woman and man unsatisfied to make big splashes in suchlittle ponds, makes them yearn for the lakes of big city prestige, if not fortruly national repute. Accordingly, to the extent that local society maintainsits position, even locally, it comes to mingle with and to identify itself witha more metropolitan crowd and to talk more easily of eastern schools and NewYork night clubs.There is one point of difference between the old and the new upper classes inthe smaller cities that is of great concern to the old, for it causes the new tobe a less ready and less reliable cash-in area for the status claims of the old.The old upper class, after all, is old only in relation to the new and henceneeds the new in order to feel that all is right in its little world of status.But the new, as well as many of the old, know well that this local society isnow only local.The men and women of the old upper class understand their station to be wellwithin their own city. They may go to Florida or California in the winter, butthey go always as visitors, not as explorers of new ways or as makers of newbusiness contacts. They feel their place to be in their own city and they tendto think of this city as containing all the principles necessary for ranking allpeople everywhere. The new upper class, on the other hand, tends to esteem localpeople in terms of the number and types of contacts they have with places andpeople outside the city—which the true old upper-class person often excludes as‘outsiders.’ Moreover, many articulate members of the middle and lower classeslook up to the new upper class because of such ‘outside’ contacts which, in adecisive way, are the very opposite of ‘old family residence.’ Old familyresidence is a criterion that is community-centered; outside contacts center inthe big city or even in the national scene.* [page_43.html#pg43fn1a]4Today ‘outside contacts’ often center in one very specific and galling reminderof national status and power which exists right in the local city: During thelast thirty years, and especially with the business expansions of World War II,the national corporation has come into many of these smaller cities. Its arrivalhas upset the old economic status balances within the local upper classes; for,with its local branch, there have come the executives from the big city, whotend to dwarf and to ignore local society.8 [ch15_notes.html#ch2en8]Prestige is, of course, achieved by ‘getting in with’ and imitating those whopossess power as well as prestige. Nowadays such social standing as the localupper classes, in particular the new upper classes, may secure, is increasinglyobtained through association with the leading officials of the greatabsentee-owned corporations, through following their style of living, throughmoving to their suburbs outside the city’s limits, attending their socialfunctions. Since the status world of the corporation group does notcharacteristically center in the local city, local society tends to drift awayfrom civic prestige, looking upon it as ‘local stuff.’In the eyes of the new upper class, the old social leaders of the city comegradually to be displaced by the corporation group. The local upper classesstruggle to be invited to the affairs of the new leaders, and even to marrytheir children into their circles. One of the most obvious symptoms of the driftis the definite movement of the local upper-class families into the exclusivesuburbs built largely by the corporation managers. The new upper class tends toimitate and to mingle with the corporation group; the ‘bright young men’ of alleducated classes tend to leave the small city and to make their careers withinthe corporate world. The local world of the old upper class is simply by-passed.Such developments are often more important to women than to men. Women arefrequently more active in social and civic matters—particularly in thoserelating to education, health, and charities—if for no other reason than thatthey have more time for them. They center their social life in the local citiesbecause ‘it is the thing to do,’ and it is the thing to do only if those withtop prestige do it. Local women, however, gain little or no social standingamong the corporate elite by participating in local affairs, since theexecutives’ wives, corporation- and city-centered, do not concern themselveswith local society, nor even with such important local matters as education; forthey send their own children to private schools or, on lower executive levels,to their own public schools in their own suburbs, distinct and separate from thecity’s. A typical local woman could work herself to the bone on civic mattersand never be noticed or accepted by the executives’ wives. But if it becameknown that by some chance she happened to be well acquainted with a metropolitancelebrity, she might well be ‘in.’Local women often participate in local and civic affairs in order to help theirhusband’s business, but the terms of the executive’s success lie within hisnational corporation. The corporate officials have very few business dealingswith strictly local businessmen. They deal with distant individuals of othercorporations who buy the plant’s products or sell it materials and parts. Evenwhen the executive does undertake some deal with a local businessman, no socialcontact is required—unless it is part of the corporation’s ‘good-will’ policy.So it is quite unnecessary for the executive’s wife to participate in localsociety: the power of the corporation’s name will readily provide him with allthe contacts in the smaller city that he will ever require.5Perhaps there was a time—before the Civil War—when local societies composed theonly society there was in America. It is still true, of course, that every smallcity is a local hierarchy of status and that at the top of each there is still alocal elite of power and wealth and esteem. But one cannot now study the uppergroups in even a great number of smaller communities and then—as many Americansociologists are prone to do—generalize the results to the nation, as theAmerican System.9 [ch15_notes.html#ch2en9] Some members of the higher circles ofthe nation do live in small towns—although that is not usual. Moreover, wherethey happen to maintain a house means little; their area of operation isnation-wide. The upper social classes of all the small towns of America cannotmerely be added up to form a national upper class; their power cliques cannotmerely be added up to form the national power elite. In each locality there isan upper set of families, and in each, with certain regional variations, theyare quite similar. But the national structure of classes is not a mereenumeration of equally important local units. The class and status and powersystems of local societies are not equally weighted; they are not autonomous.Like the economic and political systems of the nation, the prestige and thepower systems are no longer made up of decentralized little hierarchies, eachhaving only thin and distant connections, if any at all, with the others. Thekinds of relations that exist between the countryside and the town, the town andthe big city, and between the various big cities, form a structure that is nownational in scope. Moreover, certain forces, which by their very nature are notrooted in any one town or city, now modify, by direct as well as indirect linesof control, the local hierarchies of status and power and wealth that prevail ineach of them.It is to the cities of the Social Register and the celebrity, to the seats ofthe corporate power, to the national centers of political and military decision,that local society now looks—even though some of its older members will notalways admit that these cities and corporations and powers exist socially. Thestrivings of the new upper class and the example of the managerial elite of thenational corporation cause local societies everywhere to become satellites ofstatus and class and power systems that extend beyond their local horizon. Whattown in New England is socially comparable with Boston? What local industry iseconomically comparable with General Motors? What local political chief with thepolitical directorate of the nation?"},{"pageContent":"3METROPOLITAN 400THE little cities look to the big cities, but where do the big cities look?America is a nation with no truly national city, no Paris, no Rome, no London,no city which is at once the social center, the political capital, and thefinancial hub. Local societies of small town and large city have had no historiccourt which, once and for all and officially, could certify the elect. Thepolitical capital of the country is not the status capital, nor even in any realsense an important segment of Society; the political career does not parallelthe social climb. New York, not Washington, has become the financial capital.What a difference it might have made if from the beginning Boston and Washingtonand New York had been combined into one great social, political, and financialcapital of the nation! Then, Mrs. John Jay’s set (‘Dinner and Supper List for1787 and 1788’), in which men of high family, great wealth, and decisive powermingled, might, as part of the national census, have been kept intact andup-to-date.1 [ch15_notes.html#ch3en1]And yet despite the lack of official and metropolitan unity, today—seventeendecades later—there does flourish in the big cities of America a recognizableupper social class, which seems in many ways to be quite compact. In Boston andin New York, in Philadelphia and in Baltimore and in San Francisco, there existsa solid core of older, wealthy families surrounded by looser circles of newer,wealthy families. This older core, which in New York was once said—by Mrs.Astor’s Ward McAllister—to number Four Hundred, has made several bids to be TheSociety of America, and perhaps, once upon a time, it almost succeeded. Today,in so far as it tries to base itself on pride of family descent, its chances tobe truly national are subject to great risks. There is little doubt, however,that among the metropolitan 400’s, as well as among their small-towncounterparts, there is an accumulation of advantages in which objectiveopportunity and psychological readiness interact to create and to maintain foreach generation the world of the upper social classes. These classes, in each ofthe big cities, look first of all to one another.1Before the Civil War the big-city upper classes were compact and stable. Atleast social chroniclers, looking back, say that they were. ‘Society,’ Mrs. JohnKing Van Rensselaer wrote, grew ‘from within rather than from without … Theforeign elements absorbed were negligible. The social circle widened, generationby generation, through the abundant contributions made by each family toposterity … There was a boundary as solid and as difficult to ignore as theChinese Wall.’ Family lineage ran back to the formation of the colonies and theonly divisions among upper-class groups ‘were those of the church;Presbyterians, Dutch Reformed and Episcopalians formed fairly definite sectionsof a compact organization.’2 [ch15_notes.html#ch3en2]In each locality and region, nineteenth-century wealth created its ownindustrial hierarchy of local families. Up the Hudson, there were patroons,proud of their origins, and in Virginia, the planters. In every New Englandtown, there were Puritan shipowners and early industrialists, and in St. Louis,fashionable descendants of French Creoles living off real estate. In Denver,Colorado, there were wealthy gold and silver miners. And in New York City, asDixon Wecter has put it, there was ‘a class made up of coupon-clippers,sportsmen living off their fathers’ accumulation, and a stratum like the Astorsand Vanderbilts trying to renounce their commercial origins as quickly aspossible.’3 [ch15_notes.html#ch3en3]The richest people could be regarded as a distinct caste, their fortunes aspermanent, their families as honorably old. As long as they kept their wealthand no newer and bigger wealth threatened it, there was no reason to distinguishstatus by family lineage and status by wealth.4 [ch15_notes.html#ch3en4] Thestability of the older upper classes rested rather securely upon the coincidenceof old family and great wealth. For the push, the wealth, the power of new upperclasses was contained by the old, who, while remaining distinct andunthreatened, could occasionally admit new members.In the decades following the Civil War, the old upper classes of the oldercities were overwhelmed by the new wealth. ‘All at once,’ Mrs. Van Rensselaerthought, Society ‘was assailed from every side by persons who sought to climbboldly over the walls of social exclusiveness.’ Moreover, from overseas theimmigrants came, like southerners, and later westerners, to make their fortunesin the city. ‘Others who had made theirs elsewhere, journeyed to New York tospend them on pleasure and social recognition.’5 [ch15_notes.html#ch3en5]From the eighteen-seventies until the nineteen-twenties, the struggle of oldfamily with new money occurred on a grandiose national scale. Those familiesthat were old because they had become wealthy prior to the Civil War attemptedto close up their ranks against the post-Civil War rich. They failed primarilybecause the new wealth was so enormous compared with the old that it simplycould not be resisted. Moreover, the newly wealthy could not be contained in anylocality. Like the broadening national territory, new wealth and power—in familyand now in corporate form as well—grew to national size and scope. The city, thecounty, the state could not contain this socially powerful wealth. Everywhere,its possessors invaded the fine old families of metropolitan society.All families would seem to be rather ‘old,’ but not all of them have possessedwealth for at least two but preferably three or four generations. The formulafor ‘old families’ in America is money plus inclination plus time. After all,there have only been some six or seven generations in the whole of United Stateshistory. For every old family there must have been a time when someone was ofthat family but it was not ‘old.’ Accordingly, in America, it is almost as greata thing to be an ancestor as to have an ancestor.It must not be supposed that the pedigreed families do not and have not admittedunregistered families to their social circles, especially after the unregisteredhave captured their banking firms. It is only that those whose ancestors boughttheir way into slightly older families only two or three generations ago nowpush hard to keep out those who would follow suit. This game of the old rich andthe parvenu began with the beginning of the national history, and continuestoday in the small town as in the metropolitan center. The one firm rule of thegame is that, given persistent inclination, any family can win out on whateverlevel its money permits. Money—sheer, naked, vulgar money—has with fewexceptions won its possessors entrance anywhere and everywhere into Americansociety.From the point of view of status, which always tries to base itself on familydescent, this means that the walls are always crumbling; from the more generalstandpoint of an upper social class of more than local recognition, it meansthat top level is always being renovated. It also means that, no matter what itspretensions, the American upper class is merely an enriched bourgeoisie, andthat, no matter how powerful its members may be, they cannot invent anaristocratic past where one did not exist. One careful genealogist has assertedthat at the beginning of this century, there were ‘not ten families occupyingconspicuous social positions’ in either the moneyed set or the old-family set ofNew York ‘whose progenitors’ names appeared on Mrs. John Jay’s dinner list.’6[ch15_notes.html#ch3en6]In America, the prideful attempt to gain status by virtue of family descent hasbeen an uneasy practice never touching more than a very small fraction of thepopulation. With their real and invented ancestors, the ‘well-born’ and the‘high-born’ have attempted to elaborate pedigrees and, on the basis of theirconsciousness of these pedigrees, to keep their distance from the ‘low-born.’But they have attempted this with an underlying population which, in an utterlyvulgar way, seemed to glory in being low-born, and which was too ready with toomany jokes about the breeding of horses to make such pretensions easy orwidespread.There has been too much movement—of family residence and between occupations, inthe lifetime of an individual and between the generations—for feeling of familyline to take root. Even when such feeling does strengthen the claims of theupper classes, it is without avail unless it is honored by the underlyingstrata. Americans are not very conscious of family lines; they are not the sortof underlying population which would readily cash in claims for prestige on thebasis of family descent. It is only when a social structure does not essentiallychange in the course of generations, only when occupation and wealth and stationtend to become hereditary, that such pride and prejudice, and with them, suchservility and sense of inferiority, can become stable bases of a prestigesystem.The establishment of a pedigreed society, based on the prestige of family line,was possible, for a brief period, despite the absence of a feudal past and thepresence of mobility, because of the immigrant situation. It was preciselyduring the decades when the flow of the new immigration into the big cities waslargest that metropolitan Society was at its American peak. In such Yankeeghettoes, claims for status by descent were most successful, not so much amongthe population at large as among those who claimed some descent and wanted more.Such claims were and are involved in the status hierarchy of nationality groups.But there came a time when the lowly immigrant no longer served this purpose:the flow of immigration was stopped, and in a little while everyone in NorthAmerica became—or soon would become—a native-born American of native-bornparents.Even while the supply of immigrants was huge and their number in the big citiesoutnumbered those of native parentage, liberal sentiments of nationalism werebecoming too strong to be shaped by the barriers of strict descent. ‘TheAmericanization of the Immigrant’—as an organized movement, as an ideology, andas a fact—made loyalties to one ideological version of the nation more importantthan Anglo-Saxon descent. The view of the nation as a glorious melting pot ofraces and nations—carried by middle classes and intelligentsia—came to prevailover the Anglo-Saxon views of those concerned with ‘racial’ descent and with thepedigreed, registered society. Besides, each of these national groups—from theIrish to the Puerto Rican—has slowly won local political power.The attempt to create a pedigreed society has gone on among an upper class whosecomponent localities competed: the eastern seaboard was settled first; so thosewho remained there have been local families longer than the families of morerecently populated regions. Yet there are locally eminent families who have beenlocally eminent in many small New England towns for as long as any Bostonfamily; there are small-town southern families whose claims for continuity ofcousinhood could not be outdone by the most fanatic Boston Brahmin; and thereare early California families who, within their own strongly felt framework oftime, feel older and better established than any New York family might be. Thelocalities competed economically as well. The mining families and the railroadfamilies and the real-estate families—in each industry, in each locality andregion, as we have said, big wealth created its own hierarchy of local families.The pedigree is a firm and stable basis of prestige when the class structure isfirm and stable. Only then can all sorts of conventions and patterns ofetiquette take root and flower in firm economic ground. When economic change isswift and mobility decisive, then the moneyed class as such will surely assertitself; status pretensions will collapse and time-honored prejudices will beswept away. From the standpoint of class, a dollar is a dollar, but from thestandpoint of a pedigreed society, two identical sums of money—the one receivedfrom four generations of inherited trusts, the other from a real kill on themarket last week—are very different sums. And yet, what is one to do when thenew money becomes simply enormous? What is Mrs. Astor (the pedigreed lady ofKnickerbocker origin married to old, real-estate wealth) going to do about Mrs.Vanderbilt (of the vulgar railroad money and the more vulgar grandfather-in-law)in 1870? Mrs. Astor is going to lose: in 1883 she leaves her calling card atMrs. Vanderbilt’s door, and accepts an invitation to Mrs. Vanderbilt’sfancy-dress ball.7 [ch15_notes.html#ch3en7] With that sort of thing happening,you cannot run a real pedigreed status show. Always in America, as perhapselsewhere, society based on descent has been either by-passed or bought-out bythe new and vulgar rich.* [page_52.html#pg52fn1a]Here, in the social context of the self-made man, the parvenu claimed status. Heclaimed it as a self-made man rather than despite it. In each generation somefamily-made men and women have looked down upon him as an intruder, a nouveauriche, as an outsider in every way. But in each following generation—or the onefollowing that—he has been admitted to the upper social classes of the dulypedigreed families.2The status struggle in America is not something that occurred at a given timeand was then done with. The attempt of the old rich to remain exclusivelyprominent by virtue of family pedigree has been a continual attempt, whichalways fails and always succeeds. It fails because in each generation newadditions are made; it succeeds because at all times an upper social class ismaking the fight. A stable upper class with a really fixed membership does notexist; but an upper social class does exist. Change in the membership of aclass, no matter how rapid, does not destroy the class. Not the identicalindividual or families, but the same type prevails within it.There have been numerous attempts to fix this type by drawing the line in a moreor less formal way. Even before the Civil War, when new wealth was not aspushing as it later became, some social arbiter seemed to be needed by worriedhostesses confronted with social decisions. For two generations before 1850, NewYork Society depended upon the services of one Isaac Brown, sexton of GraceChurch, who, we are told by Dixon Wecter, had a ‘faultless memory for names,pedigrees, and gossip.’ He was quite ready to tell hostesses about to issueinvitations who was in mourning, who had gone bankrupt, who had friends visitingthem, who were the new arrivals in town and in Society.’ He would preside at thedoorstep at parties, and some observers claimed that he ‘possessed a list of“dancing young men” for the benefit of newly arrived party-givers.’8[ch15_notes.html#ch3en8]The extravagant wealth of the post-Civil War period called for a more articulatemeans of determining the elect, and Ward McAllister, for a time, establishedhimself as selector. In order that ‘society might be given that solidity neededto resist invasion of the flashiest profiteers,’ McAllister wished to undertakethe needed mixture of old families with position but without fashion, and the ‘“swells” who had to entertain and be smart in order to win their way.’ He issaid to have taken his task very seriously, giving over ‘his days and nights tostudy of heraldry, books of court etiquette, genealogy, and cookery …’ In thewinter of 1872–3, he organized the Patriarchs, ‘a committee of twenty-five men“who had the right to create and lead Society” by inviting to each ball fourladies and five gentlemen on their individual responsibility, which McAllisterstressed as a sacred trust.’ The original patriarchs were old-family New Yorkersof at least four generations, which, in McAllister’s American generosity, hethought ‘make as good and true a gentleman as forty.’9 [ch15_notes.html#ch3en9]During the ‘eighties, McAllister had been dropping comments to newspaper menthat there were really ‘only about 400 people in fashionable New York Society.If you go outside that number you strike people who are either not at ease in aballroom or else make other people not at ease.’10 [ch15_notes.html#ch3en10] In1892, when both the exclusiveness of the Patriarchs and the popularity of WardMcAllister were beginning seriously to decline, he published his list of ‘400,’which in fact contained about 300 names. It was simply the roll-call of thePatriarch Balls, the inner circle of pre-Civil War New York families,embellished by unattached daughters and sons who liked to dance, and a selectfew of the new rich whom McAllister deemed fit for admittance. Only nine out ofa list of the ninety richest men of the day11 [ch15_notes.html#ch3en11] appearon his list.The attention given McAllister’s list of the ‘400,’ and his subsequentretirement from high society, reflect the precarious situation of the old upperclasses he tried to consolidate. Not only in New York, but in other cities aswell, all sorts of attempts have been made to preserve the ‘old-guard’ from thesocial entree of new wealth. McAllister’s demise symbolizes the failure of allthese attempts. The only sensible thing that could be done was to admit the newwealth, or at least selected members of it. This, the most successful attempt,The Social Register, has done.In the gilded age of the 1880’s, a New York bachelor who had inherited ‘a smalllife-income and a sound though inconspicuous social standing,’ decided topublish ‘a list of the Best People from which advertising was wisely excludedbut which merchants might buy.’12 [ch15_notes.html#ch3en12] The Social Registerpresented a judicious combination of the old with the new, and, with the heartysupport of friends among such New York clubs as Calumet and Union, became animmediate success. The first Social Register of New York contained some 881families; in due course, lists were published for other cities, and the businessof compiling and publishing such lists became incorporated as The SocialRegister Association. During the ‘twenties, social registers were being issuedfor twenty-one cities, but nine of these were later dropped ‘for lack ofinterest.’ By 1928, twelve volumes were being printed in the autumn of eachyear, and ever since then there have been Social Registers for New York andBoston (since 1890), Philadelphia (1890), Baltimore (1892), Chicago (1893),Washington (1900), St. Louis (1903), Buffalo (1903), Pittsburgh (1904), SanFrancisco (1906), Cleveland (1910), and Cincinnati (1910).13[ch15_notes.html#ch3en13]The Registers list the ‘socially elect’ together with addresses, children,schools, telephone numbers, and clubs. Supplements appear in December andJanuary, and a summer edition is published each June. The Association advisesthe reader to purchase an index containing all the names in all the Registers,this being useful in so far as there are many intermarriages among families fromthe various cities and changes of address from one city to another.The Social Register describes the people eligible for its listing as ‘thosefamilies who by descent or by social standing or from other qualifications arenaturally included in the best society of any particular city or cities.’ Theexact criteria for admission, however, are hard to discern perhaps because, asWecter has asserted, ‘an efficient impersonality, detachment, and air of secretinquisition surround The Social Register. A certain anonymity is essential toits continued success and prestige.’14 [ch15_notes.html#ch3en14] Today, theSocial Register Association, with headquarters in New York, seems to be run by aMiss Bertha Eastmond, secretary of the Association’s founder from the earlydays. She judges all the names, some to be added, some to be rejected asunworthy, some to be considered in the future. In this work, she may call uponthe counsel of certain social advisers, and each city for which there is aRegister has a personal representative who keeps track of current names,addresses, and telephone numbers.Who are included in the some 38,000 conjugal family units now listed,15[ch15_notes.html#ch3en15] and why are they included? Anyone residing in any ofthe twelve chosen cities may apply for inclusion, although the recommendationsof several listed families must be obtained as well as a list of clubmemberships. But money alone, or family alone, or even both together do not seemto guarantee immediate admittance or final retention. In a rather arbitrarymanner, people of old-family are sometimes dropped; second generations of newwealth which try to get in are often not successful. To say, however, that birthand wealth are not sufficient is not to say that they, along with properconduct, are not necessary.Moderately successful corporation executives, once they set their minds to it,have been known to get into the Register, but the point should not beoverstressed. In particular, it ought to be made historically specific: thethirty-year span 1890–1920, was the major period for entrance into theregistered circle. Since the first decade of the twentieth century, in fact, therate of admission of new families into the Social Register—at least in one majorcity, Philadelphia—has steadily declined: during the first decade of thiscentury, there was a 68 per cent increase, by the decade of the ‘thirties, therate of increase was down to 6 per cent.16 [ch15_notes.html#ch3en16]Those who are dropped from The Social Register are often so well known that muchis made of their being dropped; the ‘arbitrary’ character of the Register isthen used to ridicule its social meaning. Actually, Dixon Wecter has concluded,‘unfavorable publicity seems as near as one can come to the reason forbanishment, but this again is applied with more intuition than logic … It issafe to say that anyone who keeps out of [the newspaper’s] columns—whatever hisprivate life may be, or clandestine rumors may report—will not fall foul of TheSocial Register.’17 [ch15_notes.html#ch3en17]With all the seemingly arbitrary selection and rejection, and with all thesnobbery and anguish that surrounds and even characterizes it, The SocialRegister is a serious listing that does mean something. It is an attempt, underquite trying circumstances, to close out of the truly proper circles the merelynouveau riche and those with mere notoriety, to certify and consolidate theseproper circles of wealth, and to keep the chosen circles proper and thuspresumably worthy of being chosen. After all, it is the only list of registeredfamilies that Americans have, and it is the nearest thing to an official statuscenter that this country, with no aristocratic past, no court society, no trulycapital city, possesses. In any individual case, admission may be unpredictableor even arbitrary, but as a group, the people in The Social Register have beenchosen for their money, their family, and their style of life. Accordingly, thenames contained in these twelve magic volumes do stand for a certain type ofperson.3In each of the chosen metropolitan areas of the nation, there is an upper socialclass whose members were born into families which have been registered since theSocial Register began. This registered social class, as well as newly registeredand unregistered classes in other big cities, is composed of groups of ancientfamilies who for two or three or four generations have been prominent andwealthy. They are set apart from the rest of the community by their manner oforigin, appearance, and conduct.They live in one or more exclusive and expensive residential areas in fine oldhouses in which many of them were born, or in elaborately simple modern oneswhich they have constructed. In these houses, old or new, there are the correctfurnishings and the cherished equipage. Their clothing, even when it isapparently casual and undoubtedly old, is somehow different in cut and hang fromthe clothes of other men and women. The things they buy are quietly expensiveand they use them in an inconspicuous way. They belong to clubs andorganizations to which only others like themselves are admitted, and they takequite seriously their appearances in these associations.They have relatives and friends in common, but more than that, they have incommon experiences of a carefully selected and family-controlled sort. They haveattended the same or similar private and exclusive schools, preferably one ofthe Episcopal boarding schools of New England. Their men have been to Harvard,Yale, Princeton, or if local pride could not be overcome, to a locally esteemedcollege to which their families have contributed. And now they frequent theclubs of these schools, as well as leading clubs in their own city, and as oftenas not, also a club or two in other metropolitan centers.Their names are not in the chattering, gossiping columns or even the societycolumns of their local newspapers; many of them, proper Bostonians and properSan Franciscans that they are, would be genuinely embarrassed among their ownkind were their names so taken in vain—cheap publicity and cafe-society scandalare for newer families of more strident and gaudy style, not for the old socialclasses. For those established at the top are ‘proud’; those not yet establishedare merely conceited. The proud really do not care what others below them thinkof them; the conceited depend on flattery and are easily cheated by it, for theyare not aware of the dependence of their ideas of self upon others.*[page_58.html#pg58fn1a]Within and between the various cliques which they form, members of these proudfamilies form close friendships and strong loyalties. They are served at oneanother’s dinners and attend one another’s balls. They take the quietly elegantweddings, the somber funerals, the gay coming-out parties with seriousness andrestraint. The social appearances they seem to like best are often informal,although among them codes of dress and manner, the sensibility of what iscorrect and what is not done, govern the informal and the natural as well as theformal.Their sense of civic service does not seem to take direct political form, butcauses them gladly to lead the charitable, educational, and culturalinstitutions of their city. Their wealth is such—probably several millions onthe average—that they do not usually have to use the principal; if they do notwish to work, they probably do not have to. Yet their men—especially the moresubstantial older men—generally do work and sometimes quite diligently. Theymake up the business aristocracy of their city, especially the financial andlegal aristocracy. The true gentleman—in the eastern cities, and increasinglyacross the nation—is usually a banker or a lawyer, which is convenient, forthose who possess a fortune are in need of trusted, wise, and sober men topreserve its integrity. They are the directors and the presidents of the majorbanks, and they are the senior partners and investment counselors of the leadinglaw firms of their cities.Almost everywhere in America, the metropolitan upper classes have in common,more or less, race, religion, and nativity. Even if they are not of long familydescent, they are uniformly of longer American origin than the underlyingpopulation. There are, of course, exceptions, some of them important exceptions.In various cities, Italian and Jewish and Irish Catholic families—having becomewealthy and powerful—have risen high in status. But however important, these arestill exceptions: the model of the upper social classes is still ‘pure’ by race,by ethnic group, by national extraction. In each city, they tend to beProtestant; moreover Protestants of class-church denominations, Episcopalianmainly, or Unitarian, or Presbyterian.In many cities—New York for example—there are several rather than onemetropolitan 400. This fact, however, does not mean that the big-city upperclasses do not exist, but rather that in such cities the status stucture is moreelaborate than in those with more unified societies. That there are social feudsbetween competing status centers does not destroy the status hierarchy.The family of higher status may belong to an exclusive country club wheresporting activities and social events occur, but this pattern is not of decisiveimportance to the upper levels, for ‘country clubs’ have spread downward intothe middle and even into the lower-middle classes. In smaller cities, membershipin the best country club is often the significant organizational mark of theupper groups; but this is not so in the metropolitan status market. It is thegentleman’s club, an exclusive male organization, that is socially mostimportant.Gentlemen belong to the metropolitan man’s club, and the men of the upper-classstature usually belong to such clubs in more than one city; clubs for bothsexes, such as country clubs, are usually local. Among the out-of-town clubs towhich the old upper-class man belongs are those of Harvard and Princeton andYale, but the world of the urban clubs extends well beyond those anchored in thebetter schools. It is not unusual for gentlemen to belong to three or four oreven more. These clubs of the various cities are truly exclusive in the sensethat they are not widely known to the middle and lower classes in general. Theyare above those better-known arenas where upper-class status is more widelyrecognized. They are of and by and for the upper circles, and no other. But theyare known and visited by the upper circles of more than one city.*[page_61.html#pg61fn1a]To the outsider, the club to which the upper class man or woman belongs is abadge of certification of his status; to the insider, the club provides a moreintimate or clan-like set of exclusive groupings which places and characterizesa man. Their core of membership is usually families which successfully claimstatus by descent. From intimate association with such men, newer members borrowstatus, and in turn, the accomplishments of the newer entrants help shore up thestatus of the club as a going concern.Membership in the right clubs assumes great social importance when the merelyrich push and shove at the boundaries of society, for then the line tends tobecome vague, and club membership clearly defines exclusiveness. And yet themetropolitan clubs are important rungs in the social ladder for would-be membersof the top status levels: they are status elevators for the new into the oldupper classes; for men, and their sons, can be gradually advanced from one clubto the next, and so, if successful, into the inner citadel of the mostexclusive. They are also important in the business life within and between themetropolitan circles: to many men of these circles, it seems convenient andsomehow fitting to come to important decisions within the exclusive club. ‘Theprivate club,’ one national magazine for executives recently put it, is becoming‘the businessman’s castle.’21 [ch15_notes.html#ch3en21]The metropolitan upper classes, as wealthy classes having control of eachlocality’s key financial and legal institutions, thereby have business and legalrelations with one another. For the economy of the city, especially of ametropolitan area, is not confined to the city. To the extent that the economyis national and big-city centered, and to the extent that the upper classescontrol its key places of big-city decision—the upper classes of each city arerelated to those of other cities. In the rich if gloomy quiet of a Boston cluband also in the rich and brisk chrome of a Houston club-to belong is to beaccepted. It is also to be in easy, informal touch with those who are sociallyacceptable, and so to be in a better position to make a deal over a luncheontable. The gentlemen’s club is at once an important center of the financial andbusiness network of decision and an essential center for certifying the sociallyfit. In it all the traits that make up the old upper classes seem to coincide:the old family and the proper marriage and the correct residence and the rightchurch and the right schools—and the power of the key decision. The ‘leadingmen’ in each city belong to such clubs, and when the leading men of other citiesvisit them, they are very likely to be seen at lunch in Boston’s Somerset orUnion, Philadelphia’s Racquet or Philadelphia Club, San Francisco’s PacificUnion, or New York’s Knickerbocker, Links, Brook, or Racquet and Tennis.22[ch15_notes.html#ch3en22]4The upper-class style of life is pretty much the same—although there areregional variations—in each of the big cities of the nation. The houses andclothing, the types of social occasions the metropolitan 400 care about, tend tobe homogeneous. The Brooks Brothers suit-and-shirt is not extensively advertisednationally and the store has only four branches outside New York City, but it iswell-known in every major city of the nation, and in no key city do the‘representatives’ of Brooks Brothers feel themselves to be strangers.23[ch15_notes.html#ch3en23] There are other such externals that are specific andcommon to the proper upper-class style, yet, after all, anyone with the moneyand the inclination can learn to be uncomfortable in anything but a BrooksBrothers suit. The style of life of the old upper social classes across thenation goes deeper than such things.The one deep experience that distinguishes the social rich from the merely richand those below is their schooling, and with it, all the associations, the senseand sensibility, to which this educational routine leads throughout their lives.The daughter of an old upper-class New York family, for example, is usuallyunder the care of nurse and mother until she is four years of age, after whichshe is under the daily care of a governess who often speaks French as well asEnglish. When she is six or seven, she goes to a private day school, perhapsMiss Chapin’s or Brearley. She is often driven to and from school by the familychauffeur and in the afternoons, after school, she is in the general care of thegoverness, who now spends most of her time with the younger children. When sheis about fourteen she goes to boarding school, perhaps to St. Timothy’s inMaryland or Miss Porter’s or Westover in Connecticut. Then she may attend FinchJunior College of New York City and thus be ‘finished,’ or if she is to attendcollege proper, she will be enrolled, along with many plain middle-class girls,in Bryn Mawr or Vassar or Wellesley or Smith or Bennington. She will marry soonafter finishing school or college, and presumably begin to guide her ownchildren through the same educational sequence.* [page_63.html#pg63fn1a]The boy of this family, while under seven years of age, will follow a similarpattern. Then he too will go to day school, and, at a rather earlier age thanthe girls, to boarding school, although for boys it will be called prep school:St. Mark’s or St. Paul’s, Choate or Groton, Andover or Lawrenceville, PhillipsExeter or Hotchkiss.25 [ch15_notes.html#ch3en25] Then he will go to Princeton orHarvard, Yale or Dartmouth. As likely as not, he will finish with a law schoolattached to one of these colleges.Each stage of this education is important to the formation of the upper-classman or woman; it is an educational sequence that is common to the upper classesin all the leading cities of the nation. There is, in fact, a strong tendencyfor children from all these cities to attend one of the more fashionableboarding or prep schools in New England, in which students from two dozen or sostates, as well as from foreign countries, may be readily found. As claims forstatus based on family descent become increasingly difficult to realize, theproper school transcends the family pedigree in social importance. Accordingly,if one had to choose one clue to the national unity of the upper social classesin America today, it would best be the really exclusive boarding school forgirls and prep school for boys.Many educators of the private school world feel that economic shifts bring tothe top people whose children have had no proper family background and tone, andthat the private school is a prime institution in preparing them to live at thetop of the nation in a manner befitting upper-class men and women. And whetherthe headmasters know it or not, it seems to be a fact that like the hierarchy ofclubs for the fathers—but in more important and deeper ways—the private schoolsdo perform the task of selecting and training newer members of a national upperstratum, as well as upholding the higher standards among the children offamilies who have long been at the top. It is in ‘the next generation,’ in theprivate school, that the tensions between new and old upper classes are relaxedand even resolved. And it is by means of these schools more than by any othersingle agency that the older and the newer families—when their time isdue—become members of a self-conscious upper class.As a selection and training place of the upper classes, both old and new, theprivate school is a unifying influence, a force for the nationalization of theupper classes. The less important the pedigreed family becomes in the carefultransmission of moral and cultural traits, the more important the privateschool. The school-rather than the upper-class family—is the most importantagency for transmitting the traditions of the upper social classes, andregulating the admission of new wealth and talent. It is the characterizingpoint in the upper-class experience. In the top fifteen or twenty such schools,if anywhere, one finds a prime organizing center of the national upper socialclasses. For in these private schools for adolescents, the religious and familyand educational tasks of the upper social classes are fused, and in them themajor tasks of upholding such standards as prevail in these classes arecentered.* [page_65.html#pg65fn1a]These schools are self-supporting and autonomous in policy, and the most properof them are non-profit institutions. They are not ‘church schools’ in that theyare not governed by religious bodies, but they do require students to attendreligious services, and although not sectarian, they are permeated byreligiously inspired principles. The statement of the founders of Groton, stillused today, includes this fundamental aim: ‘Every endeavor will be made tocultivate manly, Christian character, having regard to moral and physical aswell as intellectual development. The Headmaster of the School will be aclergyman of the Protestant Episcopal Church.’27 [ch15_notes.html#ch3en27]‘The vitals of a prep-school are not located in the curriculum. They are locatedin a dozen other places, some of them queer places indeed: in the relationsbetween boys and faculty; in who the boys are and where they come from; in aGothic chapel or a shiny new gymnasium; in the type of building the boys live inand the sort of thing they do after supper; and, above all in the headmaster.’28[ch15_notes.html#ch3en28] There is a kind of implicit ideal for the school to bean organized extension of the family, but a large family in which the properchildren from Boston and Philadelphia and New York together learn the properstyle of conduct. This family ideal is strengthened by the common religiouspractices of the school, which tend to be Episcopalian; by the tendency forgiven upper-class families to send all their sons to the same schools that thefather, or even grandfather, attended; and by the donations as well as thesocial and sentimental activities of the alumni associations. The underlyingpurpose of the Choate School, for example, is to prove that family and schoolmay be effectively combined, so that a boy while gaining the benefits thatschool provides—in particular ‘spiritual leadership’ and ‘association with boysof purpose’—will retain the intimate influences that ought to characterize aproper home.Daily life in the exclusive schools is usually quite simple, even Spartan;within its atmosphere of snobbish simplicity, there is a democracy of status.Everyone follows more or less the same routine, and there are no opportunitiesfor officially approved inclinations for ostentatious display or snobbery.29[ch15_notes.html#ch3en29]These schools are not usually oriented to any obvious practical end. It is truethat the boys’ schools are invariably preparatory for college; while those forgirls offer one curriculum for college preparation, and one terminal course forgirls contemplating earlier marriage. But the middle-class ethos ofcompetitiveness is generally lacking. One should, the school seems to say,compare one’s work and activity not with the boy or girl next to you, but withwhat you and your teacher believe is your own best. Besides, if you are toointerested, you become conspicuous.Certainly competition for status among students is held to a minimum: whereallowances are permitted, they are usually fixed at modest levels, and thetendency is for boys to have no spending money at all; the wearing of schoolblazers by boys, or a uniform jumper or blouse, skirt and sweater by girls, isnot, as it is usually interpreted by outsiders, so much upper-class swash as itis an attempt to defeat displays of haberdashery within the exclusive group. Andgirls, however rich, are not usually allowed to own their own horses.The elders of the school community are those older children in the higher Forms,and they become the models aspired to by the younger children. For young boys,up to eight and nine, there are carefully chosen Housemothers; between twelveand thirteen, they are weaned from women and have exclusively male teachers,although the wives of instructors often live with their husbands in apartmentswithin the boys’ dormitories and continue a virtual kinship role with them. Careis taken that the self-image of the child not be slapped down, as it might by aninsecure parent, and that manners at table as elsewhere be imbibed from thegeneral atmosphere rather than from authoritarian and forbidding figures.Then one will always know what to do, even if one is sometimes puzzled. One willreact appropriately upon meeting the man who is too carefully groomed and aboveall, the man who tries too hard to please, for one knows that that is notnecessary if one is ‘the right sort of person.’ There will be the manner ofsimplicity and the easy dignity that can arise only out of an inner certaintythat one’s being is a definitely established fact of one’s world, from which onecannot be excluded, ignored, snubbed, or paid off. And, in due course, as ayoung broker, banker, executive, one will feel smooth and handsome, with theeasy bonhomie, the look of superior amusement, and all the useful friendships;one will have just the proper touch of deference toward the older men, even ifthey are members of your own club, and just the right degree of intelligence andenthusiasms—but not too much of either, for one’s style is, after all, arealization of the motto of one’s schooling: nothing in excess.30[ch15_notes.html#ch3en30]Harvard or Yale or Princeton is not enough. It is the really exclusive prepschool that counts, for that determines which of the ‘two Harvards’ one attends.The clubs and cliques of college are usually composed of carry-overs ofassociation and name made in the lower levels at the proper schools; one’sfriends at Harvard are friends made at prep school. That is why in the uppersocial classes, it does not by itself mean much merely to have a degree from anIvy League college. That is assumed: the point is not Harvard, but whichHarvard? By Harvard, one means Porcellian, Fly, or A.D.: by Yale, one means ZetaPsi or Fence or Delta Kappa Epsilon; by Princeton, Cottage, Tiger, Cap and Gown,or Ivy.31 [ch15_notes.html#ch3en31] It is the prestige of a properly certifiedsecondary education followed by a proper club in a proper Ivy League collegethat is the standard admission ticket to the world of urban clubs and parties inany major city of the nation. To the prestige of the voice and manner,constructed in such schools, local loyalties bow, for that experience is a majorclue to the nation-wide upper class that is homogeneous and self-conscious.Among those who are being educated in similar ways, the school naturally leadsto marriage. The prep schools for boys are usually within a convenient range ofboarding schools for girls of similar age, and several times a year the studentsfrom each are thrown together for chaperoned occasions. There are, in addition,the sisters of the other boys and the brothers of the other girls. And for thoseattending the more exclusive boys’ and girls’ colleges, there are formallyarranged visits and parties—in short, dating patterns—established between them.On the college level, the exclusive schools become components of a broadenedmarriage market, which brings into dating relation the children of the uppersocial classes of the nation.5The rich who became rich before the Civil War also became the founders of mostold American families, and those who have become rich since then have joinedthem. The metropolitan upper class which they have formed has not been and isnot now a pedigreed society with a fixed membership, but for all of that, it hasbecome a nationally recognized upper social class with many homogeneous featuresand a strong sense of unity. If new families are added to it, they are alwayswealthy families, and new or old, their sons and daughters attend the same typesof exclusive schools and tend to marry one another. They belong to the sameassociations at the same set of Ivy League colleges, and they remain in socialand business touch by means of the big-city network of metropolitan clubs. Ineach of the nation’s leading cities, they recognize one another, if not strictlyas peers, as people with much in common. In one another’s biographies theyrecognize the experiences they have had in common; in their financial positionsof brokerage firm, bank, and corporation, they recognize the interests theywould all serve. To the extent that business becomes truly national, theeconomic roles of the upper classes become similar and even interchangeable; tothe extent that politics becomes truly national, the political opinion andactivity of the upper classes become consolidated. All those forces thattransform a confederation of localities and a scatter of companies into acorporate nation, also make for the coinciding interests and functions and unityof the metropolitan 400.The upper social classes have come to include a variety of members concernedwith power in its several contexts, and these concerns are shared among themembers of the clubs, the cousin-hoods, the firms, the law offices. They aretopics of conversation around the dinner table, where family members and clubassociates experience the range of great issues in a quite informal context.Having grown up together, trusting one another implicitly, their personalintimacy comes to include a respect for the specialized concerns of each memberas a top man, a policy-maker in his own particular area of power and decision.They spread into various commanding circles of the institutions of power. Onepromising son enters upon a high governmental career—perhaps the StateDepartment; his first cousin is in due course elevated to a high executive placein the headquarters of a corporation; his uncle has already ascended to navalcommand; and a brother of the first cousin is about to become the president of aleading college. And, of course, there is the family law firm, whose partnerskeep in close touch with outlying members and with the problems they face.Accordingly, in the inner circles of the upper classes, the most impersonalproblems of the largest and most important institutions are fused with thesentiments and worries of small, closed, intimate groups. This is one veryimportant meaning of the upper-class family and of the upper-class school:‘background’ is one way in which, on the basis of intimate association, theactivities of an upper class may be tacitly co-ordinated. It is also importantbecause in such circles, adolescent boys and girls are exposed to the tableconversations of decision-makers, and thus have bred into them the informalskills and pretensions of decision-makers; in short, they imbibe what is called‘judgment.’ Without conscious effort, they absorb the aspiration to be—if notthe conviction that they are—The Ones Who Decide.Within and between the upper-class families as well as their firms and offices,there are the schoolboy friendships and the prep schools and the college clubs,and later the key social and political clubs. And, in all these houses andorganizations, there are the men who will later—or at the time ofmeeting—operate in the diverse higher circles of modern society.The exclusive schools and clubs and resorts of the upper social classes are notexclusive merely because their members are snobs. Such locales and associationshave a real part in building the upper-class character, and more than that, theconnections to which they naturally lead help to link one higher circle withanother.So the distinguished law student, after prep school and Harvard, is ‘clerk’ to aSupreme Court judge, then a corporation lawyer, then in the diplomatic service,then in the law firm again. In each of these spheres, he meets and knows men ofhis own kind, and, as a kind of continuum, there are the old family friends andthe schoolboy chums, the dinners at the club, and each year of his life thesummer resorts. In each of these circles in which he moves, he acquires andexercises a confidence in his own ability to judge, to decide, and in thisconfidence he is supported by his ready access to the experience and sensibilityof those who are his social peers and who act with decision in each of theimportant institutions and areas of public life. One does not turn one’s back ona man whose presence is accepted in such circles, even under most tryingcircumstances. All over the top of the nation, he is ‘in,’ his appearance, acertificate of social position; his voice and manner, a badge of propertraining; his associates, proof at once of their acceptance and of hisstereotyped discernment."},{"pageContent":"4THE CELEBRITIESALL those who succeed in America—no matter what their circle of origin or theirsphere of action—are likely to become involved in the world of the celebrity.This world, which is now the American forum of public honor, has not been builtfrom below, as a slow and steady linking of local societies and metropolitan400’s. It has been created from above. Based upon nation-wide hierarchies ofpower and wealth, it is expressed by nation-wide means of mass communication. Asthese hierarchies and these media have come to overlay American society, newtypes of prestigeful men and women have come to compete with, to supplement, andeven to displace the society lady and the man of pedigreed wealth.With the incorporation of the economy, the ascendancy of the militaryestablishment, and the centralization of the enlarged state, there have arisenthe national elite, who, in occupying the command posts of the big hierarchies,have taken the spotlight of publicity and become subjects of the intensivebuild-up. At the same time, with the elaboration of the national means of masscommunication, the professional celebrities of the entertainment world have comefully and continuously into the national view. As personalities of nationalglamour, they are at the focal point of all the means of entertainment andpublicity. Both the metropolitan 400 and the institutional elite must nowcompete with and borrow prestige from these professionals in the world of thecelebrity.But what are the celebrities? The celebrities are The Names that need no furtheridentification. Those who know them so far exceed those of whom they know as torequire no exact computation. Wherever the celebrities go, they are recognized,and moreover, recognized with some excitement and awe. Whatever they do haspublicity value. More or less continuously, over a period of time, they are thematerial for the media of communication and entertainment. And, when that timeends—as it must—and the celebrity still lives—as he may—from time to time it maybe asked, ‘Remember him?’ That is what celebrity means.1In cafe society, the major inhabitants of the world of the celebrity—theinstitutional elite, the metropolitan socialite, and the professionalentertainer—mingle, publicly cashing in one another’s claims for prestige. It isupon cafe society that all the spotlights of publicity often coincide, spreadingthe glamour found there to wider publics. For in cafe society national glamourhas become a hard fact of well-established business routines.Cafe society exists in the restaurants and night clubs of New York City—fromFiftieth to Sixtieth streets, between Third Avenue and Sixth. Maury Paul (theoriginal ‘Cholly Knickerbocker’) seems to have invented the phrase in 1919 toindicate a small group of people who mingled in public but would not be likelyto visit in one another’s homes. By 1937, when Fortune magazine printed anincisive report on cafe society,1 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en1] the professionalcelebrities of erotic beauty and transient talent were well-planted at the keytables, along with such charter members of the old upper classes as John Hay(‘Jock’) Whitney.Cafe society is above all founded upon publicity. Its members often seem to livefor the exhibitionist mention of their doings and relations by socialchroniclers and gossip columnists. Beginning as professional party-givers or asjournalists, these chroniclers, along with headwaiters, have come to beprofessional celebrators and have shaped the world of celebrity as others knowit. Maury Paul in 1937 was still commenting upon the accredited metropolitan400, although he covered their livelier aspects. His successor, today’s ‘ChollyKnickerbocker,’ one Igor Cassini, is not so limited. The world he writes aboutis more glossy than accredited and certainly is not bound by The SocialRegister. Around such names as Stork Club, columnists of tabloid and televisionhave co-operated to fashion an aura of glamour seldom equaled in volume by themajesty of other courts.2 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en2]Perhaps it began in the ‘twenties when socialites became really bored withNewport, and began to look to Broadway, then to Hollywood, for livelierplaymates and wittier companions. Then, the speakeasy became a crossroads ofSociety and Broadway and Hollywood. ‘Its Ward McAllister was the bootlegger; itsvisiting list was Dun & Bradstreet’s; its Mrs. Astor could come from across therailroad tracks if only she came via Hollywood …’ ‘Prohibition,’ write theeditors of Fortune, ‘helped pull it out of private houses and respectable hotelsinto speakeasies in search first of a drink and then of adventure; theautomobile and radio industries gave it some new millionaires; rising realestate values drove Society out of its old brownstone houses into apartments andreconciled it to standardized mass entertainment parallel with new standardizedmass housing; and if short skirts at first raised its eyebrows, GreenwichVillage lowered its sex standard.’3 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en3]Five decades before, John L. Sullivan could not be recognized by Mrs. Astor’sWard McAllister; but Gene Tunney was welcomed by cafe society. And in 1924, whatwas the 400 to do, when the Prince of Wales seemed to prefer the jazz palace tothe quiet homes of the proper families?4 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en4] Cafe societyrather than Newport frequently became the social target of new millionaires. Andthe new upper classes of the time—much of their wealth derived from theentertainment industries—seemed to press less upon the old upper classes thanupon cafe society, in which they found ready entrée.Nowadays, cafe society often seems to be the top of such American Society as ison national view. For, if its inhabitants do not have dinner rights in a fewexclusive homes, they are instantly recognizable from their photographs. Cafesociety’s publicity has replaced the 400’s family-line, printer’s ink hasreplaced blue-blood, and a sort of talent in which the energy of hoped-forsuccess, rather than the assurance of background or the manners of inheritedwealth, is the key to the big entrance. In the world of the celebrity, thehierarchy of publicity has replaced the hierarchy of descent and even of greatwealth. Not the gentleman’s club, but the night club, not Newport in theafternoon but Manhattan at night; not the old family but the celebrity. By 1937,according to Fortune’s listings, about one-third of the cafe society ‘sociallist’ was not in The Social Register;5 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en5] today theproportion is probably less than that.The professional celebrity, male and female, is the crowning result of the starsystem of a society that makes a fetish of competition. In America, this systemis carried to the point where a man who can knock a small white ball into aseries of holes in the ground with more efficiency and skill than anyone elsethereby gains social access to the President of the United States. It is carriedto the point where a chattering radio and television entertainer becomes thehunting chum of leading industrial executives, cabinet members, and the highermilitary. It does not seem to matter what the man is the very best at; so longas he has won out in competition over all others, he is celebrated. Then, asecond feature of the star system begins to work: all the stars of any othersphere of endeavor or position are drawn toward the new star and he toward them.The success, the champion, accordingly, is one who mingles freely with otherchampions to populate the world of the celebrity.This world is at once the pinnacle of the prestige system and a big-scalebusiness. As a business, the networks of mass communication, publicity, andentertainment are not only the means whereby celebrities are celebrated; theyalso select and create celebrities for a profit. One type of celebrity,accordingly, is a professional at it, earning sizeable income not only fromworking in, but virtually living on, the mass media of communication anddistraction.The movie stars and the Broadway actress, the crooners and the TV clowns, arecelebrities because of what they do on and to these media. They are celebratedbecause they are displayed as celebrities. If they are not thus celebrated, indue time—often very short—they lose their jobs. In them, the panic for statushas become a professional craving: their very image of self is dependent uponpublicity, and they need increasing doses of it. Often they seem to havecelebrity and nothing else. Rather than being celebrated because they occupypositions of prestige, they occupy positions of prestige because they arecelebrated. The basis of the celebration—in a strange and intricate way—is atonce personal and synthetic: it is their Talent—which seems to mean theirappearance value and their skill combined into what is known as A Personality.Their very importance makes them seem charming people, and they are celebratedall the time: they seem to live a sort of gay, high life, and others, bycuriously watching them live it, celebrate them as well as their celebrated wayof life.The existence and the activities of these professional celebrities long agoovershadowed the social antics of the 400, and their competition for nationalattention has modified the character and the conduct of those who bear greatinstitutional prestige. In part, they have stolen the show, for that is theirbusiness; in part, they have been given the show by the upper classes who havewithdrawn and who have other business to accomplish.The star of the silver screen has displaced the golden debutante, to the pointwhere the latter, in New York or Boston or even Baltimore, is happy indeed tomingle in cafe society with these truly national queens. There is no doubt thatit is enormously more important to one’s prestige to have one’s picture on thecover of a truly big national magazine than in the society column of anynewspaper in America or even ten of them. And there is no doubt who gets on thecover of such magazines. The top spot for young ladies is probably Life: duringthe decade of the ‘forties, no debutante from any city got there as a debutante,but no less than 178 movie queens, professional models, and the like were theredisplayed.More serious public figures too, must now compete for attention and acclaim withthe professionals of the mass media. On provincial levels, politicians play inhillbilly bands; on national levels, they are carefully groomed and coached forthe TV camera, and, like other performers, the more important of them aresubject to review by entertainment critics:‘Last night’s “information talk” by President Eisenhower,’ Jack Gould of The NewYork Times reported on 6 April 1954, ‘was much his most successful televisionappearance … The President and his television consultant, Robert Montgomery,apparently found a “format” that enabled General Eisenhower to achieverelaxation and immeasurably greater freedom of movement. The result was theattainment of television’s most desired quality-naturalness … As the programbegan the President was shown sitting on the edge of a desk, his arms folded anda quiet smile on his lips. To his right—and the viewer’s left—was seen the flag.Then casually and conversationally he began speaking. The same mood and tonewere sustained for the next half hour … In past appearances when he usedprompters, the President’s eyes never quite hit the camera; he always waslooking just a hair to the left or to the right. But last night his eyes weredead on the lens and the viewer had a sense of being spoken to directly … As heneared the end of his talk and wanted to employ added emphasis, the Generalalternately knotted his hands or tapped the fingers of one on the palm of theother. Because they were intuitive his actions had the stamp of reality … Thecontents of General Eisenhower’s informal talk admittedly were not tooearthshaking …’6 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en6]It is quite proper that ‘The New 400’ should be listed by the gossip columnistwho, in the world of the celebrity, has replaced the well-bred man-about-townand the social hostess—the self-conscious social arbiters who once lentstability to the metropolitan 400. In charge of the publicity, these newarbiters are not the obvious satellites of any of those about whom they writeand talk. They are quite ready to tell us who belongs to ‘The New 400,’ as wellas to identify them with ‘our magnificent accomplishments as a nation.’ In 1953,Igor Loiewski Cassini—who became ‘Cholly Knickerbocker’ during thenineteen-forties—published a list of 399 names which he believed to representthe ‘aristocracy of achievement in this country.’7 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en7]These, he holds, are people who are ‘loyal’ Americans, leaders in their field ofwork, men of ‘excellent character,’ men of ‘culture and taste,’ whole men havingharmonious qualities as well as humility. Any such list, Cassini asserts, wouldchange from year to year, since it is leadership and humility that get them inand their children won’t make it unless they ‘have also bequeathed all thetalents that have made them leaders.’All of which is more or less complicated nonsense. Actually, Cassini’s list is arather arbitrary selection from among the three types of people continuously, oron occasion, caught up in the world of celebrity:I. There are the professional celebrities—making up some 30 per cent of thelist—names of the entertainment industries, champions of sport, art, journalism,and commentating. The largest sub-group among these are straight entertainers,although a handful of them could as well be considered ‘businessmen’ of theentertaining world.II. There are the metropolitan 400—but only some 12 per cent of them—people offamily lineage and property. Some of these seem merely to have been born intosuch families, but the majority combine old families with active businesspositions.III. Well over half of ‘The New 400’—58 per cent—are simply people who occupykey positions in the major institutional hierarchies: most of these aregovernment and business officials, although many are involved in both domains.There is also a small scattering (7% of the whole) of scientists, medical men,educators, religionists, and labor leaders.8 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en8]2As a social grouping, the metropolitan 400 has been supplemented and displaced,but as individuals and as cliques, they have become part of the national systemof prestige. That system does not now center in the several metropolitan 400’s.For if, as we have said, the 400’s of various cities can find no one city towhich to look, in all cities, large and small, they can all look to thenationally celebrated, and those among them with the inclination and the moneycan join the world of the celebrity.What many local observers assume to be the decline of the big-city upper classesis, in fact, the decline of the metropolitan 400 as the most emphatic publicbearer of prestige.9 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en9] If members of the 400 do notbecome part of this national system, they must withdraw into quiet localislands, living in another dimension than that of industrial and politicalpower. Those who would now claim prestige in America must join the world of thecelebrity or fade from the national scene.The metropolitan 400 reached its peak of publicized prestige as the top of thenational system of prestige about the turn of the century. In the ‘eighties and‘nineties, the older families had contended with newer families of wealth, butby World War I these newer families had gotten in. Today, the new wealthy of thepost-Civil War period are among the established upper classes of various bigcities all over the country. But, during the ‘twenties and ‘thirties, as we haveseen, the new and more glamorous contenders for prestige came to overshadow themetropolitan 400’s, which thus had to contend not only with new upper classes,but the celebrities of the entertainment world as well. Even before the‘twenties, complaints and reminiscences by members of the 400 began frequentlyto be heard.10 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en10] But all this is by no means to say thatthere is no longer a metropolitan 400. In fact, one feature of cafe society hasremained ‘the celebrated socialites’ as well as ‘the society-minded celebrities’who inhabit it. The prestige of the metropolitan 400 within cafe society isrevealed by the fact that many people of older society and wealth could gainentrée but do not care to do so.11 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en11] But it is also truethat the old certainty of position is no longer so firm among those who ‘do notcare’ to enter the ranks of the new celebrated.The metropolitan 400 has not declined at the same rate in all the major cities.The center of its decline, and its replacement in public view by cafe society,has been New York City, and generally in the Middle West, which apes the East.In Philadelphia and in the South, its decline has proceeded more slowly.‘Society’ is quite diverse: ‘In Atlanta, “the club you belong to counts”; inWashington “anyone ‘official’ is society”; in Detroit it is “who you are in theauto industry”; in Miami “it’s simply your Dun & Bradstreet rating.” In LosAngeles the new society is intertwined with the movie colony. “One thing that’sforced us to change,” explains the Los Angeles Examiner’s Society Editor LynnSpencer, “is that now when Eastern socialites come West, they’re more interestedin seeing our movie stars than in meeting our own Western Society.”’12[ch15_notes.html#ch4en12]In New York, the old Knickerbocker Society has virtually withdrawn from theostensible social scene; but, in Chicago it was still possible in 1954 for sometwo hundred pedigreed socialites, all supposedly with firm dinner rights, toknow that Mrs. Chauncey McCormick—who serves impeccable dinners on gold plateand Lowestoft china—was Queen of the Society which they formed.13[ch15_notes.html#ch4en13]The main drift in status, however, is clearly revealed by the parade of womenwho have been given American acclaim:14 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en14]I. The type of woman known as The Salon Lady—who passes before us in the pagesof Proust—has never been known in America. The salon lady was the statusrepresentative of the household she commanded; as hostess, she judged who wasand who was not to be admitted socially to it. If she gave birth to children,private tutors, not she, educated them. And in her salon, where courtiersjousted with one another intellectually for her attention, the value and thefact of monogamous virtue frequently broke down. Eroticism became a sort ofcompetitive sport in which women and men conquered one another in ways that wereintriguing and exciting.Apart from stray figures like Mabel Dodge of lower Fifth Avenue and Taos, NewMexico, there have not been women who ran genuine salons in the sense thatsalons were run as artistic and intellectual centers in Europe. The drawingrooms of the most famous American society ladies have been more often peopled bybores than by dilettantish intellectuals. They have, of course, contained a ‘fewdandies in the sense known to Savile Row and the boulevards of Paris,’ but theirforte, as Dixon Wecter put it, has most usually been the mimicry ofpersonalities and their ‘fame in repartee’ has often rested ‘upon the affinitybetween stammering and drollery.’15 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en15] The dominant typeof ‘Society’ man in America between the Civil War and World War I was rather thedancing man—the Cotillion leader; and accordingly, discussion, let alone thetype heard in the salon, has not played a noticeable part in the life of theAmerican society lady.The society lady, who held the balls and arranged the advantageous marriage forher daughter, was queen for only a relatively short period and only among arather small public. The fashionable lady may have longed for publicity, but asa fashionable lady she did not have much of a chance to get it. By the‘twenties, when the mass media began their work with serious consequences, thesociety lady knew that her brief national time was over.II. The leading figure of metropolitan 400 during the ‘twenties and ‘thirtieswas the debutante. Traditionally, the debut was for the purpose of introducing ayoung girl of high family to an exclusive marriage market, and henceperpetuating the set of upper families as an exclusive circle. In 1938, about1,000 debuts were made, at an average cost of $8,000 each; but they could notreally compete as spectacles with Hollywood. As a status model the debutantedeclined, not only because of the competition of the more entertaining glamourgirls of the fashion industry and cafe society but because by the middle‘thirties the metropolitan 400, as based on family lineage, had so diminished insocial exclusiveness that the debutante had no Society into which to make herdebut. Or, at least, it did not seem a well-enough defined Society. By 1938, theeditors of Fortune were noting that the vanishing of polite society left ‘thedebutante all dressed up with no place to go.’16 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en16]Some debutantes of the ‘thirties tried to compete with Hollywood. They hiredpress agents who saw to it that their pictures were in the newspapers andarticles about them were printed in the national magazines. The ‘trick,’ ElsaMaxwell has said, was ‘to look so bizarre and so extreme that the truck driversgasp but the ever-present cameraman will be bound to flash a bulb.’17[ch15_notes.html#ch4en17] As ‘glamorous members of the younger set,’ interestedin charities and horse-racing, their faces—with complexions ‘as translucent asalabaster’—appeared, endorsing soap in the women’s magazines.18[ch15_notes.html#ch4en18] Grade-A debutantes not only frequented midtown EastSide bars, but also worked as mannequins and even as salesgirls in exclusiveshops. But their very use by advertising media and fashion industry revealed theambiguity of their ‘social distinction.’Perhaps the extravagant private ball and the publicity that attended the debutof Brenda Frazier signified both the height of the debutante as a publicizedAmerican woman and the demise of the debutante’s monopoly on glamour. Today thedebutante is frequently not ‘introduced to society’ at private parties at herparent’s sumptuous home; she comes out along with ninety-nine other girls at alarge subscription dance in a hotel.19 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en19] The assemblyline of interlocking subscription dances is not so automatic ‘that it willproduce a debutante no matter who is put into it … There are ten committeesguarding the approaches to the debut in New York, though a girl need not passmuster with more than five …’20 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en20] To these subscriptiondances are attached most of the social secretaries, who keep lists of sub-debsand debutantes and eligible boys and arrange coming-out parties. Businessmagazines advise executives as to when and how to arrange for their daughter’sdebut, even if they are not listed in The Social Register. If the executive goesabout it right, he is assured, his daughter ‘can be considered as successfullylaunched socially as if she were a blue-blood.’21 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en21]There are still private debuts, but the mass debuts now predominate, andprobably will so long as ‘society as a well-organized, clearly defined group’does not exist after the debutante year. Yet the year of the debut is still ofsocial importance, no matter how standardized, since ‘everything’s got to becrammed into that short period because after that it disintegrates.’22[ch15_notes.html#ch4en22]In so far as the more socially prominent modern debutante makes her debut intoanything that will give her celebrity she makes it into cafe society. And, in sofar as she is celebrated widely, she must compete with the other glamorousoccupants of cafe society. The professional institutions of Conover and Powers,Mona Gardner reported in 1946, ‘have raised modeling to such a glamour pinnaclethat eligible men would far rather have a Powers or Conover girl on the arm, orin the home, than one of the blue-bloods.’23 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en23]III. In cafe society today there are still the crew-cut young men from Yale andthe debutante, but now there are also the heavy expense-account executives andThe All-American Girl.24 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en24] In any New York night club ona big night at the time of the two-o’clock show her current model can be found:with the doll face and the swank body starved down for the camera, a ratherthin, ganted girl with the wan smile, the bored gaze, and often the slightlyopened mouth, over which the tongue occasionally slides to insure thehighlights. She seems, in fact, always to be practicing for those high, nervousmoments when the lens is actually there. The terms of her competition are quiteclear: her professional stance is the stance of the woman for whom a haughtykind of unconquerable eroticism has become a way of life. It is the expensivelook of an expensive woman who feels herself to be expensive. She has the lookof a girl who knows her fate rests quite fully—even exclusively—upon the effectof her look upon a certain type of man.This is the queen—the all-American girl—who, whether she be debutante or fashionmodel or professional entertainer, sets the images of appearance and conductwhich are imitated down the national hierarchy of glamour, to the girlscarefully trained and selected for the commercial display of erotic promise, aswell as to the young housewife in the kitchen. While the public, by itsimitation, openly supports her image as a piece of very fancy sex, it is dulyshocked when disclosures are occasionally made revealing the commercialfulfillment of this promise. But how could it be otherwise? The model’s moneydoes not add up to much. But the men she meets have money, and her tastesquickly become expensive. The men she meets control careers, and she wants acareer. She is of, but not solidly in, the world of breakfasts at noon and thelong lunch. The all-American girl sits at the top of cafe society, and cafesociety, we must remember, is a profitable set of businesses, supported byexecutives on expense accounts. And so the imitators of the queen sometimesbecome expense-account girls.25 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en25] No ‘New AmericanWoman’ of Theodore Dreiser’s era knew as well as the all-American girl knowsthat ‘the wages of sin might easily be success.’The public is quite used to the idea of vice, but it likes to think it involvesonly idle rich boys and poor country girls. The men involved in the vice of cafesociety, however, are by no means boys; they are not idle; they need notpersonally be rich; and they are not interested in poor or innocent or countrygirls. The women involved are not exactly girls; they may have come from smallercities, but they are now very much big city; they are not innocent, and they arenot exactly poor. One easily forgets that the underside of the glamour of cafesociety is simply a service trade in vice. Those engaged in it—the procurers,the prostitutes, the customers, who buy and sell assorted varieties of eroticalservice—are often known to their associates as quite respectable. And theall-American girl, as a photographed image and as a person, is often a valuedand indispensable helpmate to the great American salesman.Among those whom Americans honor none is so ubiquitous as the young girl. It isas if Americans had undertaken to paint a continuing national portrait of thegirl as Queen. Everywhere one looks there is this glossy little animal,sometimes quite young and sometimes a little older, but always imagined, alwayspictured, as The Girl. She sells beer and she sells books, cigarettes, andclothes; every night she is on the TV screen, and every week on every other pageof the magazines, and at the movies too, there she is.3We have noted that since Mrs. John Jay’s eighteenth-century dinner list, thepolitical, military, and economic elite have not neatly coincided with those ofsuperior social status. This is clearly reflected in the Society of Washington,D.C., today. In so far as there is a metropolitan 400 in Washington, it ismerely one element in the social life of the Capitol, and is, in fact,overshadowed and out-ranked by official Society, especially by the Embassy Rowalong Massachusetts Avenue. Yet not all officials take Society seriously, andsome avoid it altogether; moreover, key officials, regardless of socialqualifications, must be invited, and, given the facts of politics, the turnoverrate is high.26 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en26]If cafe society and all that it represents has invaded and distracted New YorkSociety, the ascendancy of politics and the fact of political turnover have madeSociety difficult to maintain in Washington. There is nothing that could becalled cafe society in Washington; the key affairs are in private houses or inofficial residences, and most elaborately in the embassies with their titledattaches. In fact, there is no really firm line-up of Society in Washington,composed as it is of public officials and politicians, of familied hostesses andwealthy climbers, of widows with know-how and ambassadors with unofficialmessages to impart.Yet prestige is the shadow of money and power. Where these are, there it is.Like the national market for soap or automobiles and the enlarged arena offederal power, the national cash-in area for prestige has grown, slowly beingconsolidated into a truly national system. Since the men of the higherpolitical, economic, and military circles are an elite of money and power, theyaccumulate a prestige that is considerably above the ordinary; all of them havepublicity value and some of them are downright eminent; increasingly, by virtueof their position and by means of conscious public relations, they strive tomake their names notable, their actions acceptable, their policies popular. Andin all this, they tend to become national celebrities.Members of the power elite are celebrated because of the positions they occupyand the decisions they command. They are celebrities because they have prestige,and they have prestige because they are thought to have power or wealth. It istrue that they, too, must enter the world of publicity, become material for themass media, but they are sought as material almost irrespective of what they doon and to these media.The prestige of the Congressmen, John Galbraith has remarked,27[ch15_notes.html#ch4en27] is graded by the number of votes he controls and bythe committees he is on. The official’s importance is set by the number ofpeople working under him. The prestige of the businessman is measured less byhis wealth or his income—although, of course, these are important—than by thesize of his business. He borrows his prestige from the power of his company asmeasured by its size, and from his own position in its hierarchy. A smallbusinessman making a million a year is not so important and does not have thenational prestige enjoyed by the head of a major corporation who is making onlytwo hundred thousand. In the military ranks, of course, all this is made formaland rigid.At the turn of the century, the nationalization of status meant that there wererising elite groups with which local upper classes in every town and city of thenation had to compare themselves, and that when they did so, they came torealize that only locally were they at the top. Now, fifty years later, it meansthat, and much more. For what separates that age from ours is the rise of masscommunication, the prime means of acclaim and even a creator of those acclaimed.From the coincidence of the mass media and the big organization there hasemerged the prestige of the national elite. These national means of masscommunication have been the channels through which those at the top could reachthe underlying population. Heavy publicity, the technique of the build-up, andthe avaricious demand of the media for continuous copy have placed a spotlightupon these people such as no higher circles of any nation in world history haveever had upon them.The big institutions are in themselves graded worlds of prestige. They arestratified by level of office, with each level carrying its appropriateprestige. They constitute a hierarchy of people who by training and positiondefer to those above them, and come in time to respect their commanders who havesuch enormous power over them. No one can have such an organized deference groupbelow him, and possess such powers of command as it provides, without alsoacquiring prestige among those who are directly of the big institution itself.Instead of servants, there is the row of private secretaries; instead of thefine old house, the paneled office; instead of the private car, the company’slimousine, the agency’s chauffeur, the Air Force’s motor pool. Frequently, ofcourse, there are both the fine old house and the paneled office. Yet theprestige of the elite is, in the first instance, a prestige of the office theycommand rather than of the families to which they belong.The position held in the national corporation has become a major basis forstatus claims. The corporation is now the organized power center of thepropertied classes; the owning and managerial elites of the big-city upperclass, as well as the members of local society, now tend to look to thecorporation in claiming and in assigning prestige to one another, and from itthey derive many of the status privileges they enjoy.* [page_85.html#pg85fn1a]Inside the corporation and outside it among other corporate worlds as well as inthe country at large, they gain the prestige of their positions.As the national state becomes enlarged, the men who occupy the command postswithin it are transformed from ‘merely dirty politicians’ into statesmen andadministrators of note. Of course, it is true that the status pretenses ofpoliticians have to be held carefully in curb: high political figures, even whenit goes against their status grain, have had to learn to be folksy, and, fromthe standpoint of more ceremonial codes, vulgar in their tone of speech andstyle of life. Yet as the power of political institutions becomes greater, themen at the top become celebrities in a national system of prestige that cannotvery well be resisted.As military men have become more powerful during the wars and during thewar-like interludes between, they too have joined the new national prestigescheme. They, as well as policemen, derive such importance as they have from thesimple fact that violence is the final support of power and the final resort ofthose who would contest it. Only when revolution or crime threaten to disturbdomestic order does the police captain, and only when diplomacy and war threateninternational order, do the generals and admirals, come to be recognized forwhat at all times they are: indispensable elements of the order of power thatprevails within and between the national states of the world.A nation becomes a great power only on one condition: that its militaryestablishment and resources are such that it could really threaten decisivewarfare. In the rank order of states a nation must fight a great warsuccessfully in order to be truly great. The effective force of what anambassador says is a rather direct reflection of how mighty the general, howlarge and effective the fighting force standing back of him, is supposed to be.Military power determines the political standing of nations, and to the extentthat nationalism is honored, to that extent generals and admirals sharedecisively in the system of national honor.The public prestige of these various institutions varies, and accordingly theprestige of their elites. The prestige of public office and military position,for example, is higher in times of war, when business executives becomedollar-a-year men and railroad colonels, and all groups rally behind themilitant state at war. But when business-as-usual prevails, when businessmenleave government to others, public office and military status have often beenvilified, as the prestige of public employment is deflated in favor of bigbusiness.During the ‘twenties the president of General Electric apparently was consideredtoo valuable a man to be president of the United States;*[page_86.html#pg86fn1a] and, even during the ‘thirties, members of the merecabinet of the United States were not always to be placed on an equal footingwith members of very rich families.** [page_86.html#pg86fn2a] Yet this lack ofesteem for political office when compared with high corporate position has beenchanging and will change more—as the several elites come closer together withinthe state, and all of them learn better how to avail themselves of the means ofpublicity well within their powers to buy, command, or otherwise use. Thosewhose power or wealth exceeds their reputation will all the more readily becomeengaged in the means of publicity. More and more they play to the microphone andthe lens as well as the news conference.31 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en31]4Those who are familiar with the humanities, we should recall, often shy at theword ‘prestige’; they know that in its origins it means dazzling the eye withconjuring tricks. Prestige, it is often held, is a mysterious force. ‘Whateverhas been a ruling power in the world,’ Gustave Le Bon once remarked, ‘whether itbe ideas or men, has in the main enforced its authority by means of thatirresistible force expressed by the word “prestige” … Prestige in reality is asort of domination exercised on our mind by an individual, a work, or an idea…’This domination ‘paralyzes our critical faculty’ and fills us with ‘astonishmentand respect…’32 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en32]Mr. Gladstone much preferred ‘honor’ to ‘prestige.’ But, of course, as HaroldNicolson has noted,33 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en33] the meaning of prestige variesin the several countries of the western world.* [page_87.html#pg87fn1a]Moreover, men of power do not want to believe that prestige is merely somethingnice that is given to the powerful. They want their prestige to imply that otherpeople are prepared to believe in their power ‘without that power having eitherto be demonstrated or exercised.’ But still this conception is neither completenor satisfactory. In fact, it is a conception of prestige very convenient forthe already powerful—for those who would maintain it cheaply, without having touse power. And, of course, it is convenient for such people to, believe thattheir repute is based on amiable virtues rather than past power.Yet it is true that the power of guns or of money is not all there is toprestige. Some reputation must be mixed with power in order to create prestige.An elite cannot acquire prestige without power; it cannot retain prestigewithout reputation. Its past power and success builds a reputation, on which itcan coast for a while. But it is no longer possible for the power of an elitebased on reputation alone to be maintained against reputation that is based onpower.If the prestige of elite circles contains a large element of moral reputation,they can keep it even if they lose considerable power; if they have prestigewith but little reputation, their prestige can be destroyed by even a temporaryand relative decline of power. Perhaps that is what has happened to the localsocieties and metropolitan 400’s of the United States.In his theory of American prestige, Thorstein Veblen, being more interested inpsychological gratification, tended to overlook the social function of much ofwhat he described. But prestige is not merely social nonsense that gratifies theindividual ego: it serves, first of all, a unifying function. Many of the socialphenomena with which Veblen had so much fun—in fact most ‘status behavior’—serveto mediate between the elite of various hierarchies and regions. The locales ofstatus are the meeting places for various elites of decision, and leisureactivities are one way of securing co-ordination between various sections andelements of the upper class.Like high families and exclusive schools, status activities also provide amarriage market, the functions of which go well beyond the gratifications ofdisplayed elegance, of brown orchids and white satin: they serve to keep apropertied class intact and unscattered; by monopoly of sons and daughters,anchoring the class in the legalities of blood lines.‘Snobbish’ exclusiveness secures privacy to those who can afford it. To excludeothers enables the high and mighty to set up and to maintain a series of privateworlds in which they can and do discuss issues in which they train their younginformally for the decision-making temper. In this way they blend impersonaldecision-making with informal sensitivities, and so shape the characterstructure of an elite.There is another function—today the most important—of prestige and of statusconduct. Prestige buttresses power, turning it into authority, and protecting itfrom social challenge. ‘Prestige lost by want of success,’ Le Bon has remarked,‘disappears in a brief space of time. It can also be worn away, but more slowly,by being subjected to discussion … From the moment prestige is called inquestion it ceases to be prestige. The gods and men who have kept their prestigefor long have never tolerated discussion. For the crowd to admire, it must bekept at a distance.’34 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en34]‘Power for power’s sake’ is psychologically based on prestige gratification. ButVeblen laughed so hard and so consistently at the servants and the dogs and thewomen and the sports of the elite that he failed to see that their military,economic, and political activity is not at all funny. In short, he did notsucceed in relating a view of their power over armies and factories to what hebelieved, quite rightly, to be their funny business. He was, in my view, notquite serious enough about status because he did not see its full and intricateimportance to power. He saw ‘the kept classes’ and ‘the underlying population,’but in his time, he could not really understand the prestige of the powerelite.35 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en35]The heart of Veblen’s conception of prestige, and even some of its terms, wereset forth by John Adams in the late eighteenth century.36[ch15_notes.html#ch4en36] But to know that John Adams anticipated much ofVeblen’s idea is in no way to deprecate Veblen, for is not his theoryessentially an extended piece of worldly wisdom, long known and perhaps oftenstated, but stated by Veblen in magnificent form and at a time when it couldtake hold of a literate public? Adams, however, went farther than Veblen in atleast two respects: He was shrewder psychologically—and more complicated; amonghis comments we also come upon certain passages in which he tries to connectstatus phenomena, conceived as the realities of social and personal life, withthe political sphere, conceived, as his generation was wont, as a problem ofconstitution building. Adams understands the status system of a nation in a waythat Veblen does not, as politically relevant, and in this we had better listento John Adams:‘A death bed, it is said, shows the emptiness of titles. That may be. But doesit not equally show the futility of riches, power, liberty, and all earthlythings? … Shall it be inferred from this, that fame, liberty, property and life,shall be always despised and neglected? Shall laws and government, whichregulate sublunary things be neglected, because they appear baubles at the hourof death?‘… The rewards … in this life, are esteem and admiration of others—thepunishments are neglect and contempt—nor may anyone imagine that these are notas real as the others. The desire of the esteem of others is as real a want ofnature as hunger—and the neglect and contempt of the world as severe a pain, asthe gout or stone … It is a principal end of government to regulate thispassion, which in its turn becomes a principal means of government. It is theonly adequate instrument of order and subordination in society, and alonecommands effectual obedience to laws, since without it neither human reason, norstanding armies, would ever produce that great effect. Every personal quality,and every blessing of fortune, is cherished in proportion to its capacity ofgratifying this universal affection for the esteem, the sympathy, admiration andcongratulations of the public …‘Opportunity will generally excite ambition to aspire; and if even an improbablecase should happen of an exception to this rule, danger will always be suspectedand apprehended, in such circumstances, from such causes. We may soon see, thata form of government, in which every passion has an adequate counterpoise, canalone secure the public from the dangers and mischiefs, of such rivalries,jealousies, envies and hatreds.’Just what does Veblen’s theory of status have to say about the operations of thepolitical economy? The metropolitan 400—about which Veblen wrote—did not becomethe center of a national system of prestige. The professional celebrities of themass media are without power of any stable sort and are in fact ephemeralfigures among those we celebrate.Yet there is an elite demand for some sort of organization of enduring andstable prestige, which Veblen’s analysis misses. It is a ‘need’ quiteconsciously and quite deeply felt by the elite of wealth and especially theelite of power in the United States today.During the nineteenth century neither the political nor the military elite wereable to establish themselves firmly at the head or even near the head of anational system of prestige. John Adams’s suggestions, which leaned in thatdirection, were not taken up.37 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en37] Other forces and notany official system of distinction and honor have given such order as it has hadto the American polity. The economic elite—for this very reason it is uniquelysignificant—rose to economic power in such a way as to upset repeated attemptsto found national status on enduring family lines.But in the last thirty years, there have been signs of a status merger among theeconomic, political, and military elite. As an elite of power, they have begunto seek, as powerful men everywhere have always sought, to buttress their powerwith the mantle of authoritative status. They have begun to consolidate theirnew status privileges—popularized in terms of the expense account but rooteddeeply in their corporate way of life. As they come more fully to realize theirposition in the cultural world of nations, will they be content with the clownsand the queens—the professional celebrities—as the world representatives oftheir American nation?Horatio Alger dies hard, but in due course will not those Americans who arecelebrated come to coincide more clearly with those who are the most powerfulamong them? The rituals of democratic leadership are firmly expected, but in duecourse will not snobbery become official and the underlying population startledinto its appropriate grade and rank? To believe otherwise, it might seem, is toreject all that is relevant in human history. But on the other hand, the liberalrhetoric—as a cloak for actual power—and the professional celebrity—as a statusdistraction—do permit the power elite conveniently to keep out of the limelight.It is by no means certain, just at this historical juncture, that they are notquite content to rest uncelebrated.5In the meantime, the American celebrities include the trivial as well as thegrim. Behind all The Names are the images displayed in tabloid and on moviescreen, over radio and television—and sometimes not displayed but just imagined.For now all of the higher types are seen by those lower down as celebrities. Inthe world of the celebrities, seen through the magnifying glass of the massmedia, men and women now form a kaleidoscope of highly distracting images:In downtown New York, on a short street with a graveyard at one end and a riverat the other, the rich are getting out of company limousines.

Except perhaps in Texas, it is felt, there are no very richanymore, and, even if there are, they are simply elderly inheritors about todie, leaving their millions to tax collectors and favorite charities. Once upona time in America there were the fabulously rich; now that time is past andeveryone is only middle class.Such notions are not quite accurate. As a machine for producing millionaires,American capitalism is in better shape than such unsound pessimism wouldindicate. The fabulously rich, as well as the mere millionaires, are still verymuch among us; moreover, since the organization of the United States for WorldWar II, new types of ‘rich men’ with new types of power and prerogative havejoined their ranks. Together they form the corporate rich of America, whosewealth and power is today comparable with those of any stratum, anywhere oranytime in world history.1It is somewhat amusing to observe how the scholarly world has changed its viewsof the big-business circles of which the very rich are a part. When the greatmoguls were first discovered in print, the muckrakers of journalism had theircounterparts in the academic journals and books; during the ‘thirties, TheRobber Barons clawed and bit their way to infamy, as Gustavus Myers’s neglectedwork became a Modern Library best-seller and Matthew Josephson and FerdinandLundberg were the men to quote. Just now, with the conservative postwar trend,the robber barons are being transformed into the industrial statesmen. The greatcorporations, full of publicity consciousness, are having their scholarlyhistories written, and the colorful image of the great mogul is becoming theimage of a constructive economic hero from whose great achievement all havebenefited and from whose character the corporate executive borrows his right torule and his good, solid, justified feelings about doing so. It is as if thehistorians could not hold in their heads a hundred-year stretch of history butsaw all of it carefully through the political lens of each and everyadministration.Two general explanations for the fact of the very rich—now and in the past—arewidely available. The first, of muckraker origin, was best stated by GustavusMyers, whose work is a gigantic gloss in pedantic detail upon Balzac’s assertionthat behind every great fortune there lies a crime. The robber barons, as thetycoons of the post-Civil-War era came to be called, descended upon theinvesting public much as a swarm of women might descend into a bargain basementon Saturday morning. They exploited national resources, waged economic warsamong themselves, entered into combinations, made private capital out of thepublic domain, and used any and every method to achieve their ends. They madeagreements with railroads for rebates; they purchased newspapers and boughteditors; they killed off competing and independent businesses, and employedlawyers of skill and statesmen of repute to sustain their rights and securetheir privileges. There is something demonic about these lords of creation; itis not merely rhetoric to call them robber barons. Perhaps there is nostraightforward economic way to accumulate $100 million for private use;although, of course, along the way the unstraightforward ways can be delegatedand the appropriator’s hands kept clean. If all the big money is not easy money,all the easy money that is safe is big. It is better, so the image runs, to takeone dime from each of ten million people at the point of a corporation than$100,000 from each of ten banks at the point of a gun. It is also safer.Such harsh images of the big rich have been frequently challenged, not so muchon the grounds of any error in the facts advanced, as on the grounds that theyresult from estimations from the point of view of legality, morality, andpersonality, and that the more appropriate view would consider the economicfunction that the propertied moguls have performed in their time and place.According to this view, which has been most ably summed up by Joseph Schumpeter,the propertied giants are seen as men who stand at the focal points of the‘perennial gale of innovations’ that sweeps through the heyday of capitalism. Bytheir personal acumen and supernormal effort, they create and combine privateenterprises in which are embodied new technical and financial techniques or newuses for old ones. These techniques and the social forms they have assumed arethe very motors of the capitalist advance, and the great moguls who create andcommand them are the pace-setters of the capitalist motion itself. In this way,Schumpeter combines a theory of capitalist progress with a theory of socialstratification to explain, and indeed to celebrate, the ‘creative destruction’of the great entrepreneurs.1 [ch15_notes.html#ch5en1]These contrasting images—of the robber and of the innovator—are not necessarilycontradictory: much of both could be true, for they differ mainly in the contextin which those who hold them choose to view the accumulators of great fortune.Myers is more interested in legal conditions and violations, and in the morebrutal psychological traits of the men; Schumpeter is more interested in theirrole in the technological and economic mechanics of various phases ofcapitalism, although he, too, is rather free and easy with his moralevaluations, believing that only men of superior acumen and energy in eachgeneration are lifted to the top by the mechanics they are assumed to create andto focus.The problem of the very rich is one example of the larger problem of howindividual men are related to institutions, and, in turn, of how both particularinstitutions and individual men are related to the social structure in whichthey perform their roles. Although men sometimes shape institutions,institutions always select and form men. In any given period, we must balancethe weight of the character or will or intelligence of individual men with theobjective institutional structure which allows them to exercise these traits.It is not possible to solve such problems by referring anecdotally either to theguile or the sagacity, the dogmatism or the determination, the nativeintelligence or the magical luck, the fanaticism or the superhuman energy of thevery rich as individuals. These are but differing vocabularies, carryingdifferent moral judgments, with which the activities of the accumulators may bedescribed. Neither the ruthlessness and illegality, with which Gustavus Myerstends to rest content, nor the far-sighted, industrial statesmanship, with whichmany historians now seem happier, are explanations—they are merely accusation orapology. That is why modern social psychologists are not content to explain therise of any social and economic stratum by moral reference to the personaltraits of its members.The more useful key, and one which rests easier within the modern mind, isprovided by more objective circumstances. We must understand the objectivestructure of opportunities as well as the personal traits which allow andencourage given men to exploit these objective opportunities which economichistory provides them. Now, it is perfectly obvious that the personal traitsrequired for rising and for holding one’s place among waterfront gangsters willbe different from those required for success among peaceful sheepherders. WithinAmerican capitalism, it is equally obvious that different qualities wererequired for men who would rise in 1870 than for men who would rise eightdecades later. It seems therefore rather beside the point to seek the key to thevery rich in the secret springs of their personalities and mannerisms.Moreover, explanations of the rich as a social fact by reference to theirpersonal traits as individuals are usually tautological. The test of ‘ability,’for example, in a society in which money is a sovereign value is widely taken tobe money-making: ‘If you are so smart, why aren’t you rich?’ And since thecriterion of ability is the making of money, of course ability is gradedaccording to wealth and the very rich have the greatest ability. But if that isso, then ability cannot be used in explanation of the rich; to use theacquisition of wealth as a sign of ability and then to use ability as anexplanation of wealth is merely to play with two words for the same fact: theexistence of the very rich.The shape of the economy at the time of Carnegie’s adolescence was moreimportant to his chances than the fact that he had a practical mother. No matterhow ‘ruthless’ Commodore Vanderbilt might have been, he would have accomplishedlittle in appropriating railroads had the political system not been utterlycorruptible. And suppose the Sherman Act had been enforced in such a way as tobreak up the legal buttress of the great corporation.2 [ch15_notes.html#ch5en2]Where would the very rich in America—no matter what their psychologicaltraits—now be? To understand the very rich in America, it is more important tounderstand the geographical distribution of oil and the structure of taxationthan the psychological traits of Haroldson L. Hunt; more important to understandthe legal framework of American capitalism and the corruptibility of its agentsthan the early childhood of John D. Rockefeller; more important to understandthe technological progression of the capitalist mechanism than the boundlessenergy of Henry Ford, more important to understand the effects of war upon theneed for oil and the tax loophole of depletion than Sid Richardson’s undoubtedsagacity; more important to understand the rise of a system of nationaldistribution and of the mass market than the frugality of F. W. Woolworth.Perhaps J. P. Morgan did as a child have very severe feelings of inadequacy,perhaps his father did believe that he would not amount to anything; perhapsthis did effect in him an inordinate drive for power for power’s sake. But allthis would be quite irrelevant had he been living in a peasant village in Indiain 1890. If we would understand the very rich we must first understand theeconomic and political structure of the nation in which they become the veryrich.It requires many types of men and vast quantities of national endowment to runcapitalism as a productive apparatus and a money-making machine. No type of mancould have accumulated the big fortunes had there not been certain conditions ofeconomic, material, and political sort. The great American fortunes are aspectsof a particular kind of industrialization which has gone on in a particularcountry. This kind of industrialization, involving very private enterprise, hasmade it possible for men to occupy such strategic positions that they candominate the fabulous means of man’s production; link the powers of science andlabor; control man’s relation to nature—and make millions out of it. It is nothindsight that makes us sure of this; we can easily predict it of nations notyet industrialized, and we can confirm it by observing other ways ofindustrialization.The industrialization of Soviet Russia has now revealed clearly to the worldthat it is possible to carry through a rapidly advancing industrializationwithout the services of a private stratum of multimillionaires. That the SovietUnion has done so at the cost of political freedom does not alter the fact ofthe industrialization. The private corporation—and its attendantmultimillionaire accumulations—is only one way, not the only way, toindustrialize a nation. But in America it has been the way in which a vast ruralcontinent has been turned into a great industrial grid. And it has been a waythat has involved and allowed the great accumulators to appropriate theirfortunes from the industrial process.The opportunities to appropriate great fortunes out of the industrialization ofAmerica have included many facts and forces which were not and could not becontingent upon what manner of men the very rich have been, or upon anythingthey have done or did not do.The basic facts of the case are rather simple. Here was a continental domainfull of untapped natural resources. Into it there migrated millions of people.As the population steadily increased, the value of the land continuously rose.As the population increased, it formed at once a growing market for produce andgoods and a growing labor supply. Since the agricultural sector of thepopulation was growing, the industrialist did not have to depend upon his ownlaborers in factory and mine for his market.Such facts of population and resources do not of themselves lead to greataccumulations. For that, a compliant political authority is needed. It is notnecessary to retail anecdotes about the legal illegalities and the plainerillegalities which the very rich of each of our three generations havesuccessfully practiced, for they are well known. It is not possible to judgequantitatively the effects of these practices upon the accumulations of greatfortunes, for we lack the necessary information. The general facts, however, areclear: the very rich have used existing laws, they have circumvented andviolated existing laws, and they have had laws created and enforced for theirdirect benefit.The state guaranteed the right of private property; it made legal the existenceof the corporation, and by further laws, interpretations of laws, and lack ofreinforcement made possible its elaboration. Accordingly, the very rich coulduse the device of the corporation to juggle many ventures at once and tospeculate with other people’s money. As the ‘trust’ was outlawed, the holdingcompany law made it legal by other means for one corporation to own stock inanother. Soon ‘the formation and financing of holding companies offered theeasiest way to get rich quickly that had ever legally existed in the UnitedStates.’3 [ch15_notes.html#ch5en3] In the later years of higher taxes, acombination of ‘tax write-offs’ and capital gains has helped the accumulation ofprivate fortunes before they have been incorporated.Many modern theories of industrial development stress technologicaldevelopments, but the number of inventors among the very rich is so small as tobe unappreciable. It is, as a matter of fact, not the far-seeing inventor or thecaptain of industry but the general of finance who becomes one of the very rich.That is one of the errors in Schumpeter’s idea of the ‘gale of innovations’: hesystematically confuses technological gain with financial manipulation. What isneeded, as Frederick Lewis Allen once remarked, is ‘not specialized knowledge,but persuasive salesmanship, coupled with the ability to command the millionsand the investment-sales machinery of a large banking house, and to command alsothe services of astute corporation lawyers and stock-market operators.’4[ch15_notes.html#ch5en4]In understanding the private appropriations of the very rich, we must also bearin mind that the private industrial development of the United States has beenmuch underwritten by outright gifts out of the people’s domain. State, local,and federal governments have given land free to railroads, paid for the cost ofshipbuilding, for the transportation of important mail. Much more free land hasbeen given to businesses than to small, independent homesteaders. Coal and ironhave been legally determined not to be covered by the ‘mineral’ rights held bythe government on the land it leased. The government has subsidized privateindustry by maintaining high tariff rates, and if the taxpayers of the UnitedStates had not paid, out of their own labor, for a paved road system, HenryFord’s astuteness and thrift would not have enabled him to become a billionaireout of the automobile industry.5 [ch15_notes.html#ch5en5]In capitalistic economies, wars have led to many opportunities for the privateappropriation of fortune and power. But the complex facts of World War II makeprevious appropriations seem puny indeed. Between 1940 and 1944, some $175billion worth of prime supply contracts—the key to control of the nation’s meansof production—were given to private corporations. A full two-thirds of this wentto the top one hundred corporations—in fact, almost one-third went to tenprivate corporations. These companies then made money by selling what they hadproduced to the government. They were granted priorities and allotments formaterials and parts; they decided how much of these were to be passed down tosub-contractors, as well as who and how many sub-contractors there should be.They were allowed to expand their own facilities under extremely favorableamortization (20 per cent a year) and tax privileges. Instead of the normaltwenty or thirty years, they could write off the cost in five. These were alsogenerally the same corporations which operated most of the government-ownedfacilities, and obtained the most favorable options to ‘buy’ them after the war.It had cost some $40 billion to build all the manufacturing facilities existingin the United States in 1939. By 1945, an additional $26 billion worth ofhigh-quality new plant and equipment had been added—two thirds of it paid fordirectly from government funds. Some 20 of this $26 billion worth was usable forproducing peacetime products. If to the $40 billion existing, we add this $20billion, we have a $60 billion productive plan usable in the postwar period. Thetop 250 corporations owned in 1939 about 65 per cent of the facilities thenexisting, operated during the war 79 per cent of all new privately operatedfacilities built with government money, and held 78 per cent of all active primewar supply contracts as of September 1944.6 [ch15_notes.html#ch5en6] No wonderthat in World War II, little fortunes became big and many new little ones werecreated.2Before the Civil War, only a handful of wealthy men, notably Astor andVanderbilt, were multimillionaires on a truly American scale. Few of the greatfortunes exceeded $1,000,000; in fact, George Washington, who in 1799 left anestate valued at $530,000, was judged to be one of the richest Americans of histime. By the 1840’s, in New York City and all of Massachusetts, there were onlythirty-nine millionaires. The word ‘millionaire,’ in fact, was coined only in1843, when, upon the death of Peter Lorillard (snuff, banking, real estate), thenewspapers needed a term to denote great affluence.7 [ch15_notes.html#ch5en7]After the Civil War, these men of earlier wealth were to be recognized as FamilyFounders, the social shadow of their earlier wealth was to affect the statusstruggle within the metropolitan 400, and in due course their fortunes were tobecome part of the higher corporate world of the American economy. But the firstreally great American fortunes were developed during the economic transformationof the Civil War era, and out of the decisive corruptions that seem to be partof all American wars. A rural, commercial capitalism was then transformed intoan industrial economy, within the legal framework of the tariff, the NationalBanking Act of 1863 and, in 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment, which by laterinterpretations sanctified the corporate revolution. During this shift inpolitical framework and economic base, the first generation of the very richcame to possess units of wealth that dwarfed any that had previously beenappropriated. Not only were the peaks of the money pyramid higher, but the baseof the upper levels was apparently broader. By 1892, one survey revealed theexistence of at least 4,046 American millionaires.8 [ch15_notes.html#ch5en8]In our own era of slump and war, there is debate about the number and thesecurity—and even the very existence—of great American fortunes. But about thelatter nineteenth century all historians seem agreed: between the Civil War andWorld War I, great captains of enormous wealth rose speedily to pre-eminence.We shall take this generation, which came to full maturity in the ‘nineties, asthe first generation of the very rich. But we shall use it merely as a benchmark for the two following generations, the second coming to maturity about1925, and the third, in the middle years of the twentieth century. Moreover, weshall not study merely the six or seven best-known men upon whom textbookhistorians and anecdotal biographers have based their criticisms and theiradulations. For each of these last three generations, we have gatheredinformation about the richest ninety or so individuals. In all, our study ofthese three lists enables us to expand our view of the American rich to include275 American men and women, each of whom has possessed a minimum of about $30million.9* [ch15_notes.html#ch5en9]* [page_102.html#pg102fn1]Among the very rich one can find men born poor and men born rich, men whowere—and are—as flamboyant in their exercise of the power of money as they werein accumulating it, and others as miserly in their lives as harsh in theiracquisitions. Here is John D. Rockefeller—the pious son of a Baptist peddler—whocreated literally scores of multimillionaire descendents. But here is Henry O.Havemeyer whose grandfather left him three million, and Henrietta Green who as achild was taught to study the financial pages of the paper and died at ageeighty-two leaving 100 million. And we must not forget George F. Baker, Jr., aHarvard graduate and inheritor of the presidency of the First National Bank ofNew York, who bathed and shaved and dressed each morning on his speed cruisercoming into Wall Street from Long Island, and who, in 1929, with six otherbankers, mobilized a quarter of a billion dollars in a futile effort tostabilize the crash.10 [ch15_notes.html#ch5en10]The big rich are not all of the past nor are they all from Texas. It is truethat five of the richest ten among us today are of the Texas crop, but of the 90richest men and women of 1950 of whom we have adequate knowledge, only 10 percent are Texans.Popular literature now offers many glimpses of fabulously rich individuals invarious postures—august and ridiculous; of various origins—humble and elevated;of different styles of life—gay, sad, lonely, convivial. But what do all theseglimpses mean? Some started poor, some were born rich—but which is the typicalfact? And what are the keys to their success? To find out we must go beyond thesix or seven tycoons in each generation about whom social historians andbiographers have provided endless anecdotes. We must study a large enough numberof individuals to feel that we have a representative group.The 275 people about whom we have gathered information represent the bulk ofthose individuals who are known to historians, biographers, and journalists asthe richest people living in the United States since the Civil War-the 90richest of 1900, the 95 of 1925, and the 90 of 1950. Only by examining suchgroups are we able to ask and to answer, with some accuracy, the deceptivelysimple questions that interest us about the origins and careers of the veryrich.At the top of the 1900 group is John D. Rockerfeller with his billion dollars;at the top in 1925 is Henry Ford I with his billion; and, in 1950, it isreported (although it is not so certain as in other periods) that H. L. Hunt isworth ‘one or two billions.’ The fortune of another Texan, Hugh Roy Cullen, hasalso been reputed of late to come to a billion.11 [ch15_notes.html#ch5en11]These three or four men are probably the richest of the rich Americans; they arethe only billionaires of which financial biographers are fairly certain.*[page_104.html#pg104fn1a]3In none of the latest three generations has a majority of the very rich beencomposed of men who have risen.During the course of American history since the Civil War, the proportion of thevery rich whose fathers worked as small farmers or storekeepers, as white-collaremployees or wage workers has steadily decreased. Only 9 per cent of the veryrich of our own time originated in lower-class families—in families with onlyenough money to provide essential needs and sometimes minor comforts.The history of the middle-class contribution to the very rich is a fairly stableone: in the 1900 generation, it provided two out of ten; in 1925, three; and in1950 again two. But the upper-class and the lower-class contributions have quitesteadily reversed themselves. Even in the famous nineteenth-century generation,which scholarly historians usually discuss with the anectocal details of theself-making myth, as many of the very rich derived from the upper class (39 percent) as from the lower. Still, it is a fact that in that generation, 39 percent of the very rich were sons of lower-class people. In the 1925 generation,the proportion had shrunk to 12 per cent, and by 1950, as we have seen, to 9 percent. The upper classes, on the other hand, contributed 56 per cent in 1925; andin 1950, 68 per cent.The reality and the trend are clearly the upper-class recruitment of the trulyupper class of propertied wealth. Wealth not only tends to perpetuate itself,but as we shall see, tends also to monopolize new opportunities for getting‘great wealth.’ Seven out of ten of the very rich among us today were born intodistinctly upper-class homes, two out of ten on the level of middle-classcomfort, and only one in lower-class milieu.Occupationally, ‘upper class’ among these very rich has meant the bigbusinessman. At no time has the entire business stratum in America, big andlittle, been greater than 8 or 9 per cent of the working population at large;but in these three generations of the very rich as a whole, seven out of ten ofthe fathers have been urban entrepreneurs; one has been a professional man, onehas been a farmer, and one has been a white-collar employee or wage worker.Across the generations these proportions have been quite stable. The veryrich—of 1900 as of 1950—have come out of the entrepreneurial strata; and, as weshall see, in a rather curious way, on their higher levels, many of them havecontinued to be active in an ‘entrepreneurial’ manner.About 10 per cent of those who have possessed the great American fortunes havebeen born in foreign lands, although only 6 per cent grew up outside the UnitedStates, immigrating after they were adult. Of the late nineteenth-centurygeneration which reached full maturity by 1900, of course, more wereforeign-born than in 1950. About 13 per cent of the 1900 rich were foreign-born,compared with about 24 per cent of the adult male U.S. population who were atthat time foreign-born. By 1950, only 2 per cent of the very rich wereforeign-born (compared with 7 per cent of the white 1950 population).12[ch15_notes.html#ch5en12]The eastern seaboard has, of course, been the historical locale of the veryrich: in all, some eight out of ten of those who grew up in America have done soin this region. There were as many from the East in 1925 (82 per cent) as in1900 (80 per cent). By 1950, however, the proportions from the East—as among thepopulation in the country as a whole—had dropped (to 68 per cent), a directresult of the emergence of the southwestern multimillionaires, who make up some10 per cent of the very rich of 1950, compared with only about 1 per cent in1900 and in 1925. The proportions who grew up in the Chicago-Detroit-Clevelandarea have remained rather constant over the three historical epochs, 16 per centin 1900 to 19 per cent in 1950.The very rich come from the cities, especially from the larger cities of theEast. Even in 1900, a full 65 per cent of the general American population livedin rural areas,13 [ch15_notes.html#ch5en13] and many more than that had grown upon the farm; but only 25 per cent of the very rich of 1900 came from ruralareas. And, since 1925 more than six out of ten of the very rich have grown upin metropolitan areas.American-born, city-bred, eastern-originated, the very rich have been fromfamilies of higher class status, and, like other members of the new and oldupper classes of local society and metropolitan 400, they have been Protestants.Moreover, about half have been Episcopalians, and a fourth, Presbyterians.14[ch15_notes.html#ch5en14]With such facts before us, we would expect, and we do find, that the very richhave always been more highly educated than the common run of the population:even in 1900, 31 per cent of the very rich had graduated from college; by 1925,57 per cent had done so; and by 1950, 68 per cent of the holders of greatAmerican fortunes were college graduates. That educational advantages aregenerally a result of family advantages is made clear by the fact that withineach generation those from higher class levels are better educated than thosefrom lower—in 1900, 46 per cent of those of upper-class levels, but only 17 percent of those from lower, had graduated from college. But, by the thirdgeneration considered here—the very rich of 1950—the difference in the amount ofeducation according to class origin decreased: 60 per cent of the very rich whohad originated on lower or middle-class levels graduated from college, comparedwith 71 per cent of those from the upper classes.Half of all those among the very rich who attended any college attended those ofThe Ivy League; in fact, almost a third went either to Harvard or to Yale, therest being scattered among Princeton, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, andPennsylvania. An additional 10 per cent attended other famous eastern colleges,such as Amherst, Brown, Lafayette, Williams, Bowdoin, and another 10 per centwere students at one of a handful of well-known technical schools. The remaining30 per cent went to colleges and universities scattered all over the UnitedStates.The preponderance of Ivy League colleges is, of course, a direct result of thehigher class origin of the very rich: as the proportions of very rich from theupper classes increases, so do the proportions who attend the Ivy Leagueschools. Of those who were college educated, 37 per cent of the 1900 generation,47 per cent of 1925, and 60 per cent of 1950 very rich attended such schools.Back in 1900, when only 39 per cent of the very rich were children ofupper-class parents, 88 per cent of those originating in such upper-classfamilies are known to have inherited fortunes of a half a million dollars ormore—usually much more. By 1950, some 93 per cent of the very rich from theupper classes were inheritors. It is frequently said that taxes now make itimpossible for the very rich to leave outright a fortune of $90 or $100 millionto their children, and this is, in a simple legal sense, true. Yet, the 1950very rich are very much a continuation of the very rich of 1925; in fact, moreof a continuation than those of 1925 were of the 1900 generation. While 56 percent of the very rich of 1925 originated in the upper classes, only 33 per centhad relatives among the very rich of 1900. But 68 per cent of the 1950 very richoriginated in the upper classes and 62 per cent had relatives among the veryrich of the earlier generations.Moreover, by the middle years of the twentieth century, it is, in some wayseasier to transfer position and power to one’s children than it was in 1900 or1925, for then the lines of power and position were not so elaboratelyorganized, buttressed, and entrenched in well-established circles, and thetransfer of power and position seemed to be firmly assured only by means of hugepersonal fortunes. Among the very rich of 1950, however, there are many ways, aswe shall have occasion to see, to pass on to children strategic positions in theapparatus of appropriation that constitutes the higher corporate level ofAmerican free, private enterprise.4The very rich in America are not dominantly an idle rich and never have been.The proportions among them that are rentiers and not much else, have, of course,increased significently: in 1900, some 14 per cent; in 1925, some 17 per cent;and by 1950, 26 per cent. By virtue of how they spend their time, aboutone-fourth of the very richest people can now be called members of a leisureclass.Yet neither the idea of the very rich as miserly coupon clippers nor asflamboyant playboys is the representative fact. The idle miser as well as thebusy spendthrift are represented among the very rich of America, but, in thehistory of the great American fortunes, the misers have not all been mere couponclippers; they have usually ‘worked’ in some way to increase the value of thecoupons they would have to clip—or at least pretended to do so while havingothers to manage for them.* [page_108.html#pg108fn1a] And the spendthrifts havenot all been merely that: some have gambled a million and often come up with twoor three more; for their spendthrift activities have often been in the realm ofappropriative speculation.The men among the idle rich of 1900 were either third- or fourth-generationAstors or third-generation Vanderbilts: on their estates they relaxed with theirhorses, or on beaches with their yachts offshore, while their wives played oftenfrantic and always expensive social games. By 1925, there were only a few morerentiers among the very rich but many more of them were women. They lived asexpensively as did those of 1900, but now they were more scattered over theUnited States and they were given less publicity in the emerging world of thecelebrity. Having beyond any doubt ‘arrived’ socially, these very rich womenoften became engaged by ‘the arts’ instead of ‘society,’ or busily pretended tobe.15 [ch15_notes.html#ch5en15] And in fact, some of them were spending moretime in philanthropy than in social amusements or personal splendor, a fact thatwas in part due to the sober, Puritan beliefs of John D. Rockefeller from whoseaccumulations much of their money derived.In the 1950 generation, both the proportion of rentiers (which we have seen tobe 26 per cent) and the proportions of women among them (70 per cent) haveincreased, but they do not seem to form any one social type. There are themodern playgirls—Doris Duke and Barbara Hutton now expertly and expensivelytrying to conserve their youth; but there are also those who live, as did Mrs.Anita McCormick Blaine, an active life of spending money and time onphilanthropy and education, taking little active part in social affairs. Andthere was Hetty Sylvia H. Green Wilks, the modern version of the miserly couponclipper, who, as a child, had spent her summers ‘in a barred and shuttered houseand had to go to bed at 7:30 p.m. for no lights burned in the Green house afterthat hour.’16 [ch15_notes.html#ch5en16]The history of the very rich in America is, in the main, a patriarchal history:men have always held from 80 to 90 per cent of great American fortunes. Theincrease, over the generations, in the proportions of the very rich who arerecruited from inheritors of great wealth has not meant that all the rich havebecome ‘idle.’ We have seen that 62 per cent of the very rich of 1950 were borninto families connected with earlier generations of very rich; but that only 26per cent of the 1950 very rich are in their life-ways an idle rich. And many ofthe very rich who have inherited their wealth have spent their lives working tokeep it or to increase it. The game that has interested them most has been thegame of the big money.Yet some 26 per cent of the very rich of today are rentiers and more or lesseconomically idle; and another 39 per cent occupy high positions in firms ownedor controlled by their families.17 [ch15_notes.html#ch5en17] The rentiers andthe family-managers thus account for 65 per cent of the very rich of our time.What of the 35 per cent remaining who rose to very rich status?5If many of those who were born into the very rich have spent their livesworking, it is obvious that those who rose into it from middle and lower classlevels are not likely to have been idle. The rise into the very rich stratumseems to involve an economic career which has two pivotal features: the big jumpand the accumulation of advantages.I. No man, to my knowledge has ever entered the ranks of the great Americanfortunes merely by saving a surplus from his salary or wages. In one way oranother, he has to come into command of a strategic position which allows himthe chance to appropriate big money, and usually he has to have available aconsiderable sum of money in order to be able to parlay it into really bigwealth. He may work and slowly accumulate up to this big jump, but at some pointhe must find himself in a position to take up the main chance for which he hasbeen on the lookout. On a salary of two or three hundred thousand a year, evenforgetting taxes, and living like a miser in a board shack, it has beenmathematically impossible to save up a great American fortune.*[page_111.html#pg111fn1a]II. Once he has made the big jump, once he has negotiated the main chance, theman who is rising gets involved in the accumulation of advantages, which ismerely another way of saying that to him that hath shall be given. To parlayconsiderable money into the truly big money, he must be in a position to benefitfrom the accumulation advantages. The more he has, and the more strategic hiseconomic position, the greater and the surer are his chances to gain more. Themore he has, the greater his credit—his opportunities to use other people’smoney—and hence the less risk he need take in order to accumulate more. Therecomes a point in the accumulation of advantages, in fact, when the risk is norisk, but is as sure as the tax yield of the government itself.The accumulation of advantages at the very top parallels the vicious cycle ofpoverty at the very bottom. For the cycle of advantages includes psychologicalreadiness as well as objective opportunities: just as the limitations of lowerclass and status position produce a lack of interest and a lack ofself-confidence, so do objective opportunities of class and status produceinterest in advancement and self-confidence. The confident feeling that one canof course get what one desires tends to arise out of and to feed back into theobjective opportunities to do so. Energetic aspiration lives off a series ofsuccesses; and continual, petty failure cuts the nerve of the will to succeed.19[ch15_notes.html#ch5en19]Most of the 1950 very rich who are related to the very rich of earliergenerations have been born with the big jump already made for them and theaccumulation of advantages already firmly in operation. The 39 per cent of thevery rich of 1900 who originated from the upper classes inherited the big jump;and a few of them, notably the Vanderbilts and Astors, also inherited thepositions involving the accumulation of advantages. J. P. Morgan’s father lefthim $5 million and set him up as a partner in a banking firm connected withfinancial concerns in both Europe and America. That was his big jump. But theaccumulation of advantages came later when, in his capacity as financier andbroker, J. P. Morgan could lend other people’s money to promote the sale ofstocks and bonds in new companies, or the consolidation of existing companies,and receive as his commission enough stock to eventually enable his firm tocontrol the new corporation.20 [ch15_notes.html#ch5en20]After experience and profit in a lumber business, with his millionaire father’sfinancial support, Andrew Mellon went into his father’s bank and expanded it tonational scale. He then became involved in the accumulation of advantages bylending the bank’s money to young businesses—particularly in 1888, when theowners of patents for the refining of aluminum sold a share of their PittsburghReduction Company to the Mellons in return for $250,000 which they used toconstruct a mill. Andrew saw to it that this aluminum company remained amonopoly, and that the Mellons came out the controlling power.21[ch15_notes.html#ch5en21]No man, to my knowledge, has ever entered the ranks of the great Americanfortunes merely by a slow bureaucratic crawl up the corporate hierarchies. ‘Manyof the top executives in some of our largest corporations,’ Benjamin F.Fairless, Chairman of the Board of U. S. Steel, said in 1953, ‘have spent alifetime in the field of industrial management without ever having been able toaccumulate as much as a million dollars. And I know that to be fact because Ihappen to be one of them myself.’22 [ch15_notes.html#ch5en22] That statement isnot true in the sense that the heads of the larger corporations do not typicallybecome millionaires: they do. But it is true in the sense that they do notbecome millionaires because they are ‘experts’ in the field of industrialmanagement; and it is true in that it is not by industry but by finance, not bymanagement but by promotion and speculation that they typically become enriched.Those who have risen into the very rich have been economic politicians andmembers of important cliques who have been in positions permitting them toappropriate for personal uses out of the accumulation of advantages.Very few of those who have risen to great wealth have spent the major portionsof their working lives steadily advancing from one position to another withinand between the corporate hierarchies. Such a long crawl was made by only 6 percent of the very rich in 1900, and 14 per cent in 1950. But even these, whoapparently did move slowly up the corporate hierarchy, seem rarely to have madethe grade because of talents in business management. More often such talents asthey possessed were the talents of the lawyer or—very infrequently—those of theindustrial inventor.The long crawl comes to a pay-off only if it is transformed into an accumulationof advantages; this transformation is often a result of a merger of companies.Usually such a merger takes place when the companies are relatively small andoften it is cemented by marriage—as when the du Ponts bought out Laflin andRand, their largest competitor, and Charles Copeland—assistant to the presidentof Laflin and Rand—became assistant treasurer of du Pont and married LuisaD’Anbelot du Pont.23 [ch15_notes.html#ch5en23]The slow movement through a sequence of corporate positions may also mean thatone has accumulated enough inside information and enough friendship to be able,with less risk or with no risk, to speculate in the promotion or manipulation ofsecurities. That is why the generation of 1925 contains the largest proportionsof the very rich making the long crawl; then the market was open for suchprofits and the rules of speculation were not so difficult as they were later tobecome.Whatever type of venture it is that enables the rich man to parlay his stakeinto a great appropriation, at one point or another the ‘bureaucratic’ men haveusually been as much ‘entrepreneurs’ as were the classic founders of fortunesafter the Civil War. Many of them, in fact—like Charles W. Nash24[ch15_notes.html#ch5en24]—broke out on their own to found their own companies.Once the crawl was made, many of these men, especially of the 1925 set, took onall the gambling spirit and even some of the magnificence usually associatedwith the robber barons of the late nineteenth century.The economic careers of the very rich are neither ‘entrepreneurial’ nor‘bureaucratic.’ Moreover, among them, many of those who take on the managementof their families’ firms are just as ‘entrepreneurial’ or as ‘bureaucratic’ asthose who have not enjoyed such inheritance. ‘Entrepreneur’ and ‘bureaucrat’ aremiddle-class words with middle-class associations and they cannot be stretchedto contain the career junctures of the higher economic life in America.The misleading term ‘entrepreneur’ does not have the same meaning when appliedto small businessmen as it does when applied to those men who have come topossess the great American fortunes. The sober bourgeois founding of a business,the gradual expanding of this business under careful guidance until it becomes agreat American corporation is not an adequate picture of the fortune founders atthe higher levels.The entrepreneur, in the classic image, was supposed to have taken a risk, notonly with his money but with his very career; but once the founder of a businesshas made the big jump he does not usually take serious risks as he comes toenjoy the accumulation of advantages that lead him into great fortune. If thereis any risk, someone else is usually taking it. Of late, that someone else, asduring World War II and in the Dixon-Yates attempt, has been the government ofthe United States. If a middle-class businessman is in debt for $50,000, he maywell be in trouble. But if a man manages to get into debt for $2 million, hiscreditors, if they can, may well find it convenient to produce chances for hismaking money in order to repay them.25 [ch15_notes.html#ch5en25]The robber barons of the late nineteenth century usually founded or organizedcompanies which became springboards for the financial accumulations that placedthem among the very rich. In fact, 55 per cent of the very rich of 1900 made thefirst step to great fortune by the big jump of promoting or organizing their owncompanies. By 1925, however, and again in 1950, only 22 per cent of the veryrich made such a jump.Very rarely have the men of any of these generations become very rich merely bythe energetic tutelage of one big firm. The accumulation of advantages hasusually required the merging of other businesses with the first one founded—afinancial operation—until a large ‘trust’ is formed. The manipulation ofsecurities and fast legal footwork are the major keys to the success of suchhigher entrepreneurs. For by such manipulation and footwork they attainedpositions involved in the accumulation of advantages.The major economic fact about the very rich is the fact of the accumulation ofadvantages: those who have great wealth are in a dozen strategic positions tomake it yield further wealth. Sixty-five per cent of the very richest people inAmerica today are involved in enterprises which their families have passed on tothem or are simply living as rentiers on the huge returns from such properties.The remaining 35 per cent are playing the higher economic game more actively, ifno more daringly, than those who used to be called entrepreneurs but who inlater day capitalism are more accurately called the economic politicians of thecorporate world.There are several ways to become rich. By the middle of the twentieth century inthe United States, it has become increasingly difficult to earn and to keepenough money so as to accumulate your way to the top. Marriage involving moneyis at all times a delicate matter, and when it involves big money, it is ofteninconvenient and sometimes insecure. Stealing, if you do not already have muchmoney, is a perilous undertaking. If you are really gambling for money, and doso long enough, your capital will, in the end, balance out; if the game isfixed, you are really earning it or stealing it, or both, depending on whichside of the table you sit. It is not usual, and it never has been the dominantfact, to create a great American fortune merely by nursing a little businessinto a big one. It is not usual and never has been the dominant fact carefullyto accumulate your way to the top in a slow, bureaucratic crawl. It is difficultto climb to the top, and many who try fall by the way. It is easier and muchsafer to be born there.6In earlier generations the main chance, usually with other people’s money, wasthe key; in later generations the accumulation of corporate advantages, based ongrandfathers’ and father’s position, replaces the main chance. Over the lastthree generations, the trend is quite unmistakable: today, only 9 per cent ofthe very rich came from the bottom; only 23 per cent are of middle-class origin;68 per cent came from the upper classes.The incorporation of the United States economy occurred on a continentabundantly supplied with natural resources, rapidly peopled by migrants, withina legal and political framework willing and able to permit private men to do thejob. They did it. And in fulfilling their historical task of organizing forprofit the industrialization and the incorporation, they acquired for theirprivate use the great American fortunes. Within the private corporate system,they became the very rich.In realizing the power of property and in acquiring instruments for itsprotection, the very rich have become involved, and now they are deeplyentrenched, in the higher corporate world of the twentieth-century Americaneconomy. Not great fortunes, but great corporations are the important units ofwealth, to which individuals of property are variously attached. The corporationis the source of wealth, and the basis of the continued power and privilege ofwealth. All the men and the families of great wealth are now identified withlarge corporations in which their property is seated.Economically, as we have seen, neither the inheritors nor the accumulators havebecome an idle rich class of leisurely and cultivated persons. There are suchamong them, but almost three-fourths of the very rich of our day have continuedto be more or less, and in one way or another, economically active. Theireconomic activities are, of course, corporation activities: promoting andmanaging, directing and speculating.Moreover, as the propertied family has entered the corporate economy, it hasbeen joined in the corporate world by the managers of these properties, who, aswe shall presently see, are not themselves exactly unpropertied, and who, infact, are not an entirely distinct economic species from the very rich. Theorganizing center of the propertied classes has, of course, shifted to includeother powers than those held by the big propertied families. The propertysystem, of which rich men form so key a part, has been strengthened by itsmanagerial reorganization, and it has been supplemented by the executivestratum, within and between the great corporations, which works energeticallyfor the common interests of the corporate rich.Socially, the men and women of the great American fortunes have taken theirplaces as leaders of the several metropolitan 400’s. Of the ninety members ofthe 1900 very rich, only nine were included in Ward McAllister’s 1892 list, butroughly half of the families in our 1900 listing have descendants who in 1940were listed in the Social Registers of Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, or NewYork. The very rich are leading members of the metropolitan 400. They belong toits clubs, and many of them, and almost all of their children, went to Grotonand then to Harvard, or to other such schools. Twelve of the fifteen sons (wholived to be of college age) of the ten men out of the 1900 very rich whomFrederick Lewis Allen selected as the leading financiers of 1905, went to eitherHarvard or Yale; the other three to Amherst, Brown, and Columbia.26[ch15_notes.html#ch5en26]The very rich do not reign alone on top of visible and simple hierarchies. Butthat they have been supplemented by agents and by hierarchies in the corporatestructure of the economy and of the state does not mean that they have beendisplaced. Economically and socially, the very rich have not declined. After thecrash and after the New Deal, the very rich have had to operate with skilled,legal technicians (both in and out of governments) whose services are essentialin the fields of taxes and government regulations, corporate reorganization andmerger, war contracts and public relations. They have also adopted everyconceivable type of protective coloration for the essentially irresponsiblenature of their power, creating the image of the small-town boy who made good,the ‘industrial statesman,’ the great inventor who ‘provides jobs,’ but who,withal, remains just an average guy.What has happened is that the very rich are not so visible as they once seemed,to observers of the muckraker age, for example—who provided the last reallypublic view of the top of American society. The absence of systematicinformation and the distraction of ‘human-interest’ trivia tend to make ussuppose that they do not really matter and even that they do not really exist.But they are still very much among us—even though many are hidden, as it were,in the impersonal organizations in which their power, their wealth, and theirprivileges are anchored."},{"pageContent":"6THE CHIEF EXECUTIVESMANY of those who are disposed to celebrate the American economy rest their caseupon a curious jumble of notions about the chief executives of the bigcorporations. Within the free, private, enterprising system, it is said, therehas arisen a set of executives who are quite distinct from the ‘crudeold-fashioned entrepreneurs’ out for themselves in the ruthless ways of acapitalism now long dead. These executives, who have risen to the top, have cometo be responsible trustees, impartial umpires, and expert brokers for aplurality of economic interests, including those of all the millions of smallproperty holders who hold stock in the great American enterprises, but also thewage workers and the consumers who benefit from the great flow of goods andservices.These executives, it is held, are responsible for the refrigerator in thekitchen and the automobile in the garage—as well as all the planes and bombsthat now guard Americans from instant peril. All of them, or nearly all, havecome up from the bottom of the ladder; they are either farm boys who have nowmade good in the big city, or poor immigrants who have come to America and nowenjoy the dream of success it allows. Full of the know-how that made Americagreat; efficient, straightforward, honest, the chief executives, it is oftensaid, ought really to be allowed to run the government, for if only such menwere in charge there would be no waste, no corruption, no infiltration. Dirtypolitics, in short, would become clean business.On a slightly higher level of sophistication, however, rather unpleasant thingsare said about the executives. After all, they are powerful men, rather new menof power, but upon what basis does their power rest? They are not the owners ofthe corporate properties, and yet they run the corporate show. If theirinterests are quite distinct from the interests of the rightful owners, justwhat are those interests? Have not these chief executives carried through asilent revolution, a managerial revolution from the top, and has not theirrevolution transformed the very meaning of property? Are not, in short, the oldexpropriators now expropriated by their salaried managers? Maybe the chiefexecutives are trustees for a variety of economic interests, but what are thechecks upon how fair and well they perform their trusts? And was it not thestate, subject to the control of a free electorate, that was to be theresponsible trustee, the impartial umpire, the expert broker of conflictinginterests and contending powers?Both the pleasantries and the unpleasantries about the executives are generallywrong and equally jumbled. The pleasantries are often mere kindergarten chatterfor economic illiterates; the unpleasantries often rest on some very fastinferences from a few simple facts about the scale, the organization, and themeaning of private property in America. For in the agreeable as well as thedisagreeable notions about the higher economic circles, one simple fact is oftenoverlooked: the chief executives and the very rich are not two distinct andclearly segregated groups. They are both very much mixed up in the corporateworld of property and privilege, and to understand either we must understandsomething of the upper levels of their corporate world.1The corporations are the organized centers of the private property system: thechief executives are the organizers of that system. As economic men, they are atonce creatures and creators of the corporate revolution, which, in brief, hastransformed property from a tool of the workman into an elaborate instrument bywhich his work is controlled and a profit extracted from it. The smallentrepreneur is no longer the key to the economic life of America; and in manyeconomic sectors where small producers and distributors do still exist theystrive mightily—as indeed they must if they are not to be extinguished—to havetrade associations or governments act for them as corporations act for bigindustry and finance.1 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en1]Americans like to think of themselves as the most individualistic people in theworld, but among them the impersonal corporation has proceeded the farthest andnow reaches into every area and detail of daily life. Less than two-tenths of 1per cent of all the manufacturing and mining companies in the United States nowemploy half of all the people working in these basic industries.2[ch15_notes.html#ch6en2] The story of the American economy since the Civil Waris thus the story of the creation and consolidation of this corporate world ofcentralized property.I. In the development of each major industrial line, competition between manysmall firms tends to be most frequent at the industry’s beginning. There is thena jockeying and maneuvering which, in due course, results in consolidation andmerger. Out of the youthful competition, there emerges the Big Five, or the BigThree, as the case may be: a small set of firms which shares what there is toshare of the industry’s profits, and which dominates the decisions made by andfor the industry. ‘The power exercised by a few large firms,’ John K. Galbraithhas remarked, ‘is different only in degree and precision of its exercise fromthat of the single-firm monopoly.’3 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en3] If they competewith one another they do so less in terms of price than in terms of ‘productdevelopment,’ advertising, and packaging.4 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en4] No singlefirm among them decides, but neither is the decision made impersonally by acompetitive, autonomous market. There is simply too much at stake for that sortof slipshod method to be the going rule. Decisions become, explicitly orimplicitly, the decisions of committees; the Big Three or Four, one way oranother, are in on the major decisions that are rendered. In this there need beno explicit conspiracy, and certainly none that is provable. What is importantis that each big producer makes his decisions on the basis of his impression ofthe reactions of the other big producers.II. In the process of corporate consolidation many owning entrepreneurs and evensalaried managers become too narrow; they cannot detach themselves from theirown particular company. Managers with less personal feelings for any one firmcome gradually to displace such men narrowed by their own experience andinterests. On the higher levels, those in command of great corporations must beable to broaden their views in order to become industrial spokesmen rather thanmerely heads of one or the other of the great firms in the industry. In short,they must be able to move from one company’s policy and interests to those ofthe industry. There is one more step which some of them take: They move from theindustrial point of interest and outlook to the interests and outlook of theclass of all big corporate property as a whole.The transitions from company to industry and from industry to class are aided bythe fact that corporate ownership is, in a limited way, scattered. The very factof the spread of ownership among the very rich and the chief executives of thegreat corporations makes for a unity of the property class, since the control ofmany corporations by means of various legal devices has excluded the smaller butnot the larger propertied interests.5 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en5] The ‘scatter’ ofsizeable property is within a quite small circle; the executives and owners whoare in and of and for this propertied class cannot merely push the narrowinterests of each property; their interests become engaged by the wholecorporate class.III. The six and a half million people who owned stock in publicly heldcorporations in 1952 made up less than 7 per cent of all adults in thepopulation.6 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en6] But that is not the whole story; in fact,by itself, it is misleading. What is important is, first, what types of peopleown any stock? And second, how concentrated is the value of the stock they own?First of all: 45 per cent of the executives, 26 per cent of all professionalpersons, and 19 per cent of all supervisory officials hold stock. But only 0.2per cent of the unskilled workers, 1.4 per cent of the semi-skilled workers, and4.4 per cent of foremen and skilled workers hold stock.7[ch15_notes.html#ch6en7] Some 98.6 per cent of all workers in manufacturing ownno stock whatsoever.Second, in 1952, only 1.6 million (25 per cent) of the 6.5 million people whoheld any stock received as much as $10,000 per year from any and all sources. Wedo not know how much of that $10,000 came from dividends, but there is reason tobelieve that the average proportion was not great.8 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en8] In1949, some 165,000—about one-tenth of 1 per cent of all U.S. adults—received 42per cent of all the corporate dividends going to individuals. The minimum incomeof these people for that year was $30,000.9 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en9] The idea ofa really wide distribution of economic ownership is a cultivated illusion: atthe very most, 0.2 or 0.3 per cent of the adult population own the bulk, thepay-off shares, of the corporate world.IV. The top corporations are not a set of splendidly isolated giants. They havebeen knit together by explicit associations, within their respective industriesand regions and in supra-associations such as the NAM. These associationsorganize a unity among the managerial elite and other members of the corporaterich. They translate narrow economic powers into industry-wide and class-widepowers; and they use these powers, first, on the economic front, for examplewith reference to labor and its organizations; and, second, on the politicalfront, for example in their large role in the political sphere. And they infuseinto the ranks of smaller businessmen the views of big business.When such associations appear to be unwieldy, containing conflicting lines ofargument, cliques have emerged within them which have attempted to steer theirprograms and lend direction to their policies.10 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en10] Inthe higher circles of business and its associations, there has long been atension, for example, between the ‘old guard’ of practical conservatives and the‘business liberals,’ or sophisticated conservatives.11 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en11]What the old guard represents is the outlook, if not always the intelligentinterests, of the more narrow economic concerns. What the business liberalsrepresent is the outlook and the interests of the newer propertied class as awhole. They are ‘sophisticated’ because they are more flexible in adjusting tosuch political facts of life as the New Deal and big labor, because they havetaken over and used the dominant liberal rhetoric for their own purposes, andbecause they have, in general, attempted to get on top of, or even slightlyahead of, the trend of these developments, rather than to fight it as practicalconservatives are wont to do.V. The growth and interconnections of the corporations, in short, have meant therise of a more sophisticated executive elite which now possesses a certainautonomy from any specific property interest. Its power is the power ofproperty, but that property is not always or even usually of one coherent andnarrow type. It is, in operating fact, class-wide property.Would it not, after all, be quite strange if, in a country so devoted to privateproperty and where so much of it is now piled up, and in an atmosphere which inthe last fifty years has often been quite hostile, where men of economic meansalso possess, we are continually told, the greatest administrative andmanagerial ability in the world—would it not be strange if they did notconsolidate themselves, but merely drifted along, doing the best they could,merely responding to day-to-day attacks upon them?VI. Such consolidation of the corporate world is underlined by the fact thatwithin it there is an elaborate network of interlocking directorships.‘Interlocking Directorate’ is no mere phrase: it points to a solid feature ofthe facts of business life, and to a sociological anchor of the community ofinterest, the unification of outlook and policy, that prevails among thepropertied class. Any detailed analysis of any major piece of business comesupon this fact, especially when the business involves politics. As a minimuminference, it must be said that such arrangements permit an interchange of viewsin a convenient and more or less formal way among those who share the interestsof the corporate rich. In fact, if there were not such overlappingdirectorships, we should suspect the existence of less formal, although quiteadequate, channels of contact. For the statistics of interlocking directoratesdo not form a clean index to the unity of the corporate world or theco-ordination of its policy: there can be and there is co-ordinated policywithout interlocking directors, as well as interlocking directors withoutco-ordinated policy.12 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en12]VII. Most of the thirty-odd billion dollar corporations of today began in thenineteenth century. Their growth was made possible not only by machinetechnology but by the now primitive office instruments of typewriters,calculators, telephones, and rapid printing, and, of course, the transportationgrid. Now the technique of electronic communication and control of informationis becoming such that further centralization is entirely possible.Closed-circuit television and the electronic calculator put control of anenormous array of production units—no matter now decentralized such technicalunits may be—under the control of the man in the front office. The intricatelyspecialized apparatus of the corporation will inevitably be more easily heldtogether and controlled.The trend within the corporate world is toward larger financial units tied intointricate management networks far more centralized than is the case today.Productivity has and will increase fabulously, especially when automation makesit possible to interlock several machines in such a way as to eliminate the needfor much of the human control at the point of production that is now required.That means that the corporate executives will not need to manage hugeorganizations of people; rather, in Business Week’s words, they will be‘operating great mechanical organizations using fewer and fewer people.’13[ch15_notes.html#ch6en13]All this has not been and is not now inevitable; certainly the enormous size ofthe modern corporation cannot be explained as due to increased efficiency; manyspecialists regard the size now typical of the giants as already in excess ofthe requirements of efficiency. In truth, the relationship of corporate size toefficiency is quite unknown; moreover, the scale of the modern corporation isusually due more to financial and managerial amalgamations than to technicalefficiency.* [page_124.html#pg124fn1a] But inevitable or not, the fact is thattoday the great American corporations seem more like states within states thansimply private businesses. The economy of America has been largely incorporated,and within their incorporation the corporate chiefs have captured thetechnological innovation, accumulated the existing great fortunes as well asmuch lesser, scattered wealth, and capitalized the future. Within the financialand political boundaries of the corporation, the industrial revolution itselfhas been concentrated. Corporations command raw materials, and the patents oninventions with which to turn them into finished products. They command the mostexpensive, and therefore what must be the finest, legal minds in the world, toinvent and to refine their defenses and their strategies. They employ man asproducer and they make that which he buys as consumer. They clothe him and feedhim and invest his money. They make that with which he fights the wars and theyfinance the ballyhoo of advertisement and the obscurantist bunk of publicrelations that surround him during the wars and between them.Their private decisions, responsibly made in the interests of the feudal-likeworld of private property and income, determine the size and shape of thenational economy, the level of employment, the purchasing power of the consumer,the prices that are advertised, the investments that are channeled. Not ‘WallStreet financiers’ or bankers, but large owners and executives in theirself-financing corporations hold the keys of economic power. Not the politiciansof the visible government, but the chief executives who sit in the politicaldirectorate, by fact and by proxy, hold the power and the means of defending theprivileges of their corporate world. If they do not reign, they do govern atmany of the vital points of everyday life in America, and no powers effectivelyand consistently countervail against them, nor have they as corporate-made mendeveloped any effectively restraining conscience.* [page_125.html#pg125fn1a]2The corporate world is only two or three generations old, yet even in this shorttime, it has selected and created certain types of men who have risen with itand within it. What manner of men are they? We are not here interested in thebulk of the corporate managers, nor in any average executive—if such aconception is meaningful and revealing. We are interested in the very top men ofthe corporate world—top according to the criteria which they themselves use ingrading one another: the controlling positions they occupy.The chief executives are the men who occupy the top two or three command postsin each of those hundred or so corporations which, measured by sales andcapital, are the largest. If, in any one year we list these leadingcorporations, in all industrial lines, and from their top levels select thepresidents and the chairmen of their boards, we shall have listed the chiefexecutives. We have six or seven careful studies of such executives, coveringthe period of the last century.17 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en17]Are the top executives of the big corporations a distinct breed of men, or arethey merely a miscellaneous collection of Americans? Are they what Balzac wouldhave called a genuine social type? Or do they represent a cross-section ofAmericans who happen to be successful? The top executives of the big companiesare not, and never have been, a miscellaneous collection of Americans; they area quite uniform social type which has had exceptional advantages of origin andtraining, and they do not fit many of the stereotypes that prevail about them.The top executives of 1950 are not country boys who have made good in the city:whereas 60 per cent of the population about the time of their birth, in 1890,lived in rural areas, only 35 per cent of the 1950 executives were born in ruralcommunities. And this was even more true in ‘the good old days’: even in 1870,only half of the executives were farm born, compared with 93 per cent of the1820 population.They are not immigrants, poor or rich, or even the sons of immigrants who havemade good in America. The families of about half of the 1950 executives settledin America before the revolution—which is not a much different proportion thanamong the population at large, and which of course represents a decline from the1870 executives, of whom 86 per cent were of colonial families. Yet only 8 percent of the post-Civil-War executives have been foreign-born—and only 6 per centof the 1950 set, less than half the 15 per cent foreign-born among therepresentative population at the time of their birth. The proportion of sons ofthe foreign-born—of the second generation—has increased, especially in the newerindustries of distribution and mass entertainment and communication; but itstill remains below the representative level. Over three-quarters of the 1950executives are American-born of American-born fathers.The business executives are predominately Protestant and more likely, incomparison with the proportions of the population at large, to be Episcopaliansor Presbyterians than Baptists or Methodists. The Jews and Catholics among themare fewer than among the population at large.These urban, white, Protestant Americans were born into families of the upperand upper-middle classes. Their fathers were mainly entrepreneurs: 57 per centare sons of businessmen; 14 per cent, of professional men; 15 per cent, offarmers. Only 12 per cent are sons of wage workers or of lower white-collaremployees. This entrepreneurial origin more emphatically sets the executives offas a group apart when we remember that at the time of their start in life—around1900—only 8 per cent of all the men at work in America were businessmen, only 3per cent were professional men. Some 25 per cent were then ‘farmers’—anambiguous term—and almost 60 per cent, five times greater a proportion thanamong the executives, were in wage or salary work.Moreover, apart from a decline in farm boys, the executives of the entirepost-Civil-War era are substantially similar in occupational origin. At anyperiod, over 60 per cent—usually closer to 70—of American executives have beenfrom the business and professional classes; and never more than 10 or 12 percent from the wage worker or lower white-collar employee level. In fact, only 8per cent of the paternal grandfathers of the 1950 executives were wage or officeworkers, while 57 per cent of the male population were. Of these grandfathers,54 per cent were business or professional, at a time when no more than 9 percent of the male population was; 33 per cent of the grandfathers were farmers orplanters, roughly the same as the general male population.For at least two generations now, the families of the top executives of the bigAmerican corporations have, as a group, been far removed from wage work and thelower white-collar ranks. In fact, their families are in a substantialproportion citizens of good repute in the local societies of America. And only2½ per cent of the top executives who were under 50 years of age in 1952 (thenewest crop) come up from the ranks of wage-worker families.18[ch15_notes.html#ch6en18]Back in 1870, not more than 1 or 2 per cent of adult American men had graduatedfrom college, but about one-third of the 1870 executives had. Among today’sexecutives, nine times as great a proportion (60 per cent) are college graduatesas among the comparable white males between 45 and 55 years of age (7 per cent).Moreover, almost half of them have had formal educational training beyondcollege, 15 per cent in law, 15 per cent in engineering, and about the sameproportion in miscellaneous courses and schools.19 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en19]The typical executives, today as in the past, were born with a big advantage:they managed to have fathers on at least upper middle-class levels of occupationand income; they are Protestant, white, and American-born. These factors oforigin led directly to their second big advantage: they are well educated in theformal sense of college and post-college schooling. That such facts of originwere keys to their educational advantages is clear from the simple fact thatamong them—as among any group we might study—those with the highest origins havehad the best chances for formal education.The salaries of the executives vary somewhat by the industry they are in, but in1950 the top 900 executives averaged about $70,000 a year; the chief executiveofficers among them, about $100,000.20 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en20] But salariesare not typically their only source of income. In the briefcases of virtuallyevery major executive there is a portfolio ready for additional stockcertificates. There are many places of secure anchorage in the corporate world,*[page_129.html#pg129fn1a] but the most secure is the position of the owner ofbig pieces of corporate property. In the big corporation the fact that theexecutives do not own the property they manage means that by their decisionsthey do not risk their own property. When the profits are high they continue toreceive high salaries and bonuses. When they don’t go so well, their salariesoften continue quite high even though their bonuses drop. The bulk of executivestoday, in addition to salary payments, received bonuses, either in stock orcash, and often in installments over a period of years.21[ch15_notes.html#ch6en21] In 1952, among the highest paid executives wereCrawford Greenewalt, President of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., with$153,290 in salary and $350,000 in bonuses; Harlow Curtice, then one of fourexecutive vice-presidents of General Motors, received $151,200 in salary and$370,000 in bonuses; Eugene G. Grace, President of Bethlehem Steel Corp.,received $150,000 as salary and $306,652 in bonuses. Charles E. Wilson, with hismuch-publicized salary and stockholdings, was the highest paid executive inAmerican industry: $201,000 in salary and $380,000 in bonuses, plus an unknownamount in dividends.22 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en22]The executives do not constitute a ‘leisure class,’23 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en23]but they are not without the higher comforts. By the time they are fifty orsixty years of age, most chief executives have impressive houses, usually in thecountry, but not too far from ‘their cities.’ Whether they also have places intown depends somewhat on the city—they are more likely to in New York or Bostonthan in Los Angeles. Now they are receiving large incomes, from their salariesas well as from dividends which may amount to as much or more. And so at aboutthis point they branch out in a variety of ways. Many acquire sizable farms andgo in for raising fancy livestock. Wilson, of Detroit and Washington, hasAyrshire cattle on his Michigan farm and plans to experiment with a new breed onhis Louisiana plantation.24 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en24] Cyrus Eaton has short-horncattle. Mr. Eisenhower, in his smaller way, now emulates his models withAberdeen-Angus. The executives are definitely numerous among the three or fourthousand people who own boats of over 65 feet or 15 ton displacement. They mayeven ride to hounds, and moreover, like Mr. George Humphrey, wear pink coatswhile doing so. The leisure of many chief executives is taken up by countryplaces and a good deal of hunting. Some fly by private plane to the Canadianwoods, others have private cabanas at Miami or Hobe Sound.It is not characteristic of American executives to read books, except books on‘management’ and mysteries; ‘The majority of top executives almost never readdrama, great fiction, the philosophers, the poets. Those who do venture intothis area … are definitely sports of the executive type, looked upon by theircolleagues with mingled awe and incredulity.’25 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en25]Executive circles do not overlap very much with those of artistic or literaryinterest. Among them are those who resent reading a report or a letter longerthan one page, such avoidance of words being rather general. They seem somehowsuspicious of long-winded speeches, except when they are the speakers, and theydo not, of course, have the time. They are very much of the age of the‘briefing,’ of the digest, of the two-paragraph memo. Such reading as they do,they often delegate to others, who clip and summarize for them. They are talkersand listeners rather than readers or writers. They pick up much of what theyknow at the conference table and from friends in other fields.3If we attempt to draw blueprints of the external careers of the executives, wefind several more or less distinct types:I. Entrepreneurs, by definition, start or organize a business with their own orwith others’ funds, and as the business grows so does their stature asexecutives. Less educated than other executives, this type tends to beginworking at an earlier age and to have worked in several companies. According tothe careful tally of Miss Suzanne I. Keller, a grand total of 6 per cent of thetop corporation executives in 1950 America have followed such an entrepreneurialroute to the top.II. Some executives have been placed in companies owned by their fathers orother relatives and have subsequently inherited their positions. These men tendto begin work later in their lives than other types, and frequently never workin companies other than the one in which they eventually come to the top. Inthese companies, however, they often work for considerable periods beforeassuming the key posts of command. Some 11 per cent of the 1950 executives aresuch family-managers.III. Another 13 per cent did not begin in business at all, but as professionalmen, primarily lawyers. Their work in their profession leads—usually afterprofessional success—to their becoming corporation presidents or board chairmen.As the incorporation of the economy got under way, William Miller has noted,corporations felt the need, on the one hand, to get in touch with lawyers inpublic office and, on the other, ‘to have growing recourse to private legaladvice in the making of day to day business decisions. The demand for suchadvice, indeed, became so great that the best paid metropolitan lawyers almostwithout exception after 1900 made business counseling the focus of their work,at the expense of traditional advocacy; and many lawyers yielded to theblandishments of the corporations to become house counsel and even regularbusiness executives themselves.’26 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en26] Today, the successof the corporation depends to a considerable extent upon minimizing its taxburden, maximizing its speculative projects through mergers, controllinggovernment regulatory bodies, influencing state and national legislatures.Accordingly, the lawyer is becoming a pivotal figure in the giant corporation.IV. These three types of careers—entrepreneurial, family, and professional—havebeen followed by about one-third of the top 1950 executives. The externalcareer-line of the remaining 68 per cent is a series of moves, over a longperiod of time, within and between the various levels and circles of thecorporate business worldTwo generations ago, 36 per cent of the executives—as compared with only 6 percent today—were entrepreneurial; 32 per cent were family-managers, as against 11per cent today; there were about the same proportion then of professional men,14 per cent, as now, 13 per cent. Steadily and swiftly—from 18 per cent in 1870to 68 per cent in 1950—the career of the business executive has become amovement within and between the corporate hierarchies.If we examine the careers of 900 top 1950 executives—the largest group ofcontemporary executives whose careers have been studied—we find that the bulk ofthem began their work for large companies, and that about one-third of them havenever worked for any other company than the one they now head. The greaternumber worked for one or two other companies, and over 20 per cent worked forthree or four. So there is typically some criss-crossing of corporate boundariesin their climb. Even so, their average age when they were hired by their presentcompany was about twenty-nine.About a third, as one might expect on the basis of their origin and education,started in their present company as executives. Well over a third—in fact 44 percent—started in various ‘departments.’ That leaves about 24 per cent who startedas clerks or laborers. We must, however, be careful about interpreting suchfigures. Low jobs in themselves do not mean anything, especially when oneconsiders the backgrounds and higher educations of these executives. The takingof a clerical or, much better, a labor job for awhile ‘to learn the business’ isoften a sort of ritual for some families and some companies. At any rate, moreof the chief executives started on the executive level; more of the younger menstarted in the more specialized departments. For example, over one-third ofthose under 50 had a position in ‘sales’ just before their top jobs.27[ch15_notes.html#ch6en27]Those are the outside facts of the executive’s career. But the outside facts, nomatter how added up, are not inside facts. There is the bureaucratic crawl andthere is the entrepreneurial leap. But there is also the deal of the fixer, thecoup of the promoter, the maneuver of the clique. Words like entrepreneur andbureaucrat are no more adequate to convey the realities of the higher corporatecareer than of the appropriation of great fortunes. They are, as we have notedin connection with the very rich, middle-class words, and retain the limitationsof middle-class perspectives.‘Entrepreneur’ suggests the picture of a man with all the risks of life abouthim, soberly founding an enterprise and carefully nurturing its growth into agreat company. In 1950, a far more accurate picture of the ‘entrepreneurial’activity of the corporate elite is the setting up of a financial deal whichmerges one set of files with another. The chief executives of today do lessbuilding up of new organizations than carrying on of established ones. And, asRobert A. Gordon has indicated, they are less creative, restless, dynamicindividuals than professional co-ordinators of decisions, ‘approving decisionsthat flow up … from … subordinates, but doing less and less initiation.’28[ch15_notes.html#ch6en28]It is usual in studies of business executives to term such a career,‘bureaucratic,’ but, strictly speaking, this is not correct. The bureaucraticcareer, properly defined, does not mean merely a climb up, from one level to thenext, of a hierarchy of offices. It does involve that, but more importantly, itmeans the setting up of strict and unilateral qualifications for each officeoccupied. Usually these qualifications involve both specified formal trainingand qualifying examinations. The bureaucratic career also means that men workfor salaried advancement without any expectation of coming to own even a part ofthe enterprise, of personally appropriating a portion of the accumulatedproperty of the enterprise, by bonuses or stock options or lavish pension andinsurance plans.* [page_133.html#pg133fn1a]Just as the word ‘entrepreneur,’ as used to refer to the career of the very richof today, is often misleading, so the word ‘bureaucratic,’ as used to refer tocorporation executives on the higher levels, is misleading. Both the advancementof the chief executives and the accumulations of the very rich, on the higherlevels, are definitely mixed up in a ‘political’ world of corporate cliques. Toadvance within and between private corporate hierarchies means to be chosen foradvancement by your superiors—administrative and financial—and there are nostrict, impersonal rules of qualifications or seniority known to all concernedin this process.On the higher levels of the corporate world, careers are neither ‘bureaucratic’nor ‘entrepreneurial;’ they are a composite of payoffs, involving speculators,men with great American fortunes, and executives in jobs with chances to makemoney. The owners alone can no longer say with William H. Vanderbilt in 1882,‘The public be Damned.’ Neither can the professional executives alone.Together—as a set of corporate cliques—they can say what they want, althoughtoday they are usually too wise in the ways of public relations to say it, andbesides they do not need to say it.4There is, of course, no one type of corporate hierarchy, but one general featureof the corporate world does seem to prevail quite widely. It involves a NumberOne stratum at the top whose members as individuals—and increasingly ascommittees—advise and counsel and receive reports from a Number Two stratum ofoperating managers.29 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en29]It is of the Number One stratum that the very rich and the chief executives area part. The Number Two men are individually responsible for given units, plants,departments. They stand between the active working hierarchies and the directingtop to which they are responsible. And in their monthly and yearly reports tothe top executives, one simple set of questions is foremost: Did we make money:If so, how much? If not, why not?Decision-making by individual executives at the top is slowly being replaced bythe worried-over efforts of committees, who judge ideas tossed before them,usually from below the top levels. The technical men, for example, may negotiatefor months with the salesmen over a tubeless tire before the chief executivesdescend to operation-level conferences.30 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en30] Theirs isnot the idea nor even the decision, but The Judgment. On the top levels thisjudgment usually has to do with the spending of money to make more money and thegetting of others to do the work involved. The ‘running’ of a large businessconsists essentially of getting somebody to make something which somebody elsewill sell to somebody else for more than it costs. John L. McCaffrey, the chiefexecutive of International Harvester, recently said, ‘… he [a businesspresident] seldom lies awake very long thinking about finances or law suits orsales or production or engineering or accounting problems … When he approachessuch problems the president can bring to bear on them all the energy and thetrained judgment and past experience of his whole organization.’ And he goes onto say what top executives do think about at night: ‘the biggest trouble withindustry is that it is full of human beings.’The human beings on the middle levels are mainly specialists. ‘We sit at ourdesks all day,’ this chief executive continues, ‘while around us whiz and gyratea vast number of special activities, some of which we only dimly understand. Andfor each of these activities, there is a specialist … All of them, no doubt, aregood to have. All seem to be necessary. All are useful on frequent occasions.But it has reached the point where the greatest task of the president is tounderstand enough of all these specialties so that when a problem comes up hecan assign the right team of experts to work on it … How can he maintain theinterest of and get full advantage from the specialists who are too specializedto promote? On the one hand, the company absolutely requires the skills of thespecialists in order to carry on its complicated operations. On the other hand,he has to get future top management from somewhere. And that somewhere has to belargely within the existing company, if he is to have any management morale atall … we live in a complicated world—a world that has spiritual and moralproblems even greater than its economic and technical problems. If the kind ofbusiness system we now have is to survive, it must be staffed by men who candeal with problems of both kinds.’31 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en31]It is below the top levels, it is where the management hierarchies arespecialized and varied by industrial line and administrative contour, that themore ‘bureaucratic’ types of executives and technicians live their corporatelives. And it is below the top levels, in the domain of the Number Two men, thatresponsibility is lodged. The Number One stratum is often too high to be blamedand has too many others below it to take the blame. Besides, if it is the top,who is in a position to fix the blame upon its members? It is something like the‘line’ and ‘staff’ division invented by the army. The top is staff; the NumberTwo is line, and thus operational. Every bright army officer knows that to makedecisions without responsibility, you get on the staff.32[ch15_notes.html#ch6en32]On the middle levels, specialization is required. But the operating specialistwill not rise; only the ‘broadened’ man will rise. What does that mean? Itmeans, for one thing, that the specialist is below the level on which men arewholly alerted to profit. The ‘broadened’ man is the man who, no matter what hemay be doing, is able clearly to see the way to maximize the profit for thecorporation as a whole, in the long as well as in the short run. The man whorises to the top is the broadened man whose ‘specialty’ coincides with the aimsof the corporation, which is the maximizing of profit. As he is judged to haverealized this aim, he rises within the corporate world. Financial expediency isthe chief element of corporate decision, and generally, the higher theexecutive, the more he devotes his attention to the financial aspect of thegoing concern.33 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en33]Moreover, the closer to the corporate top the executive gets, the more importantare the big-propertied cliques and political influence in the making of hiscorporate career. This fact, as well as the considerations for co-optation thatprevail, is nicely revealed in a letter that Mr. Lammot du Pont wrote in 1945 inresponse to a suggestion from a General Motors executive that General George C.Marshall be appointed to the board of directors. Mr. du Pont discussed theproposal: ‘My reasons for not favoring his membership on the board are: Firsthis age [The General was then 65]; second, his lack of stockholdings, and third,his lack of experience in industrial business affairs.’ Mr. Alfred P. Sloan,chairman of General Motors, in considering the matter, generally concurred, butadded: ‘I thought General Marshall might do us some good, when he retires,following his present assignment—assuming he continues to live in Washington;recognizing the position he holds in the community and among the governmentpeople and the acquaintances he has—and he became familiar with our thinking andwhat we are trying to do, it might offset the general negative attitude towardbig business, of which we are a symbol and a profitable business, as well. Itseems to me that might be some reason, and in that event the matter of age wouldnot be particularly consequential.’In considering other appointments, Mr. Sloan wrote to W. S. Carpenter, a largeowner of du Pont and General Motors: ‘George Whitney [G. M. director andchairman of J. P. Morgan & Co.] belongs to the board of directors of quite anumber of industrial organizations. He gets around a lot because he lives in NewYork where many contacts are easily and continuously made. Mr. Douglas [Lewis W.Douglas, a G. M. board member, chairman of the Mutual Life Insurance Company,former Ambassador to Great Britain] is, in a way, quite a public character. Heseems to spend a great deal of time in other things. It seems to me that suchpeople do bring into our councils a broader atmosphere than is contributed bythe “du Pont directors” and the General Motors directors.’34[ch15_notes.html#ch6en34]Or examine a late case of corporate machination that involved the several typesof economic men prevailing in higher corporate circles. Robert R.Young—financial promoter and speculator—recently decided to displace WilliamWhite, chief executive of the New York Central Railroad and a lifetime careerexecutive in railroad operation.* [page_137.html#pg137fn1a] Young won—but did itreally matter? Success in the corporate world does not follow the pattern itfollows in the novel, Executive Suite, in which the technologically inclinedyoung man, just like William Holden, wins by making a sincere speech aboutcorporate responsibility. Besides the favors of two friends, each a leadingmember of the very rich, Mr. Young’s income, over the past seventeen years—mostof it from capital gains—is reported to be well in excess of $10 million. Hisyearly income is well over a million, his wife’s, half a million—and they manageto keep, after taxes, some 75 per cent of it.37 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en37] Butthen, no fiction known to us begins to grasp the realities of the corporateworld today.5When successful executives think back upon their own careers, they very oftenemphasize what they always call ‘an element of luck.’ Now what is that? We aretold that Mr. George Humphrey makes it a point to have ‘lucky men’ work withhim. What this means, translated out of the magical language of luck, is thatthere is an accumulation of corporate success. If you are successful, that showsthat you are lucky, and if you are lucky, you are chosen by those up the line,and thus you get chances to be more successful. Time and time again, inclose-ups of the executive career, we observe how men in the same circles chooseone another. For example, Mr. Humphrey was on an advisory committee to theCommerce Department. There he meets Mr. Paul Hoffman. Later, when Mr. Hoffmanheads ECA, he pulls in Mr. Humphrey to run an advisory committee on Germanindustry. There General Clay notices him. General Clay naturally knows GeneralEisenhower, so when General Eisenhower goes up, General Clay recommends Mr.Humphrey to his close friend, President Eisenhower.38 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en38]There is another item that ties in with the network of friends which people call‘luck’: the social life of the corporation. It is a reasonable assumption thatpart of the executive career is spent ‘politic-ing.’ Like any politician,especially when he is at or near the top of his hierarchy, the successfulexecutive tries to win friends and to make alliances, and he spends, onesuspects, a good deal of time guessing about the cliques he thinks oppose him.He makes power-plays, and these seem part of the career of the managerial elite.To make the corporation self-perpetuating, the chief executives feel that theymust perpetuate themselves, or men like themselves—future men not only trainedbut also indoctrinated. This is what is meant when it was truly said recently ofa man high in the world’s largest oil company that he ‘is really as much aproduct of the company as are the two million barrels of oil products it makesevery day.’ As future executives move upward and toward the center, they becomemembers of a set of cliques, which they often confusedly refer to as a team.They must listen. They must weigh opinions. They must not make snap judgments.They must fit into the business team and the social clique. In so far as thecareer is truly corporate, one advances by serving the corporation, which meansby serving those who are in charge of it and who judge what its interests are.39[ch15_notes.html#ch6en39]The executive career is almost entirely a career within the corporate world,less than one out of ten of the top men over the last three generations havingentered top position from independent professional or from outside hierarchies.Moreover, it is increasingly a career within one company: back in 1870, morethan six out of ten executives gained the top rung from outside the corporation;by 1950, almost seven out of ten did so from within the company.40[ch15_notes.html#ch6en40] First you are a vice-president, then you are presidentYou must be known well, you must be well liked, you must be an insider.Success in the higher corporate world is obviously determined by the standardsof selection that prevail and the personal application of these standards by themen who are already at the top. In the corporate world, one is drawn upward bythe appraisals of one’s superiors. Most chief executives take much pride intheir ability ‘to judge men’; but what are the standards by which they judge?The standards that prevail are not clear-cut and objective; they seem quiteintangible, they are often quite subjective, and they are often perceived bythose below as ambiguous. The professors of ‘business psychology’ have been busyinventing more opaque terms, and searching for ‘executive traits,’ but most ofthis ‘research’ is irrelevant nonsense, as can readily be seen by examining thecriteria that prevail, the personal and social characteristics of the successes,and their corporate style of life.On the lower and middle levels of management, objective criteria having to dowith skillful performance of occupational duties do often prevail. It is evenpossible to set up rules of advancement and to make them known in a regularbureaucratic manner. Under such conditions, skill and energy do often pay offwithout what one may call the corporate character having to be developed. Butonce a man of the lower ranks becomes a candidate for higher corporate position,the sound judgment, the broadened view, and other less tangible traits of thecorporate character are required. ‘Character,’ Fortune magazine observers haveremarked, even how the man looks as an executive, became more important thantechnical ability.41 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en41]One often hears that practical experience is what counts, but this is veryshort-sighted, for those on top control the chances to have practical experienceof the sort that would be counted for the higher tasks of sound judgment andcareful maneuver. This fact is often hidden by reference to an abstract,transferable quality called ‘managerial ability,’ but many of those who havebeen up close to the higher circles (but not of them) have been led to suspectthat there probably is no such thing. Moreover, even if there were such ageneralized ability, only the uninformed would think that it was what was neededin high policy office, or that one should go to the trouble of recruiting$200,000-a-year men for such work. For that you hire a $20,000-a-year man, orbetter still, you employ a management counseling firm, which is what the$200,000-a-year men do. Part of their ‘managerial ability’ consists precisely inknowing their own inabilities and where to find someone with the requisiteability and the money to pay for it. In the meantime, the most accurate singledefinition of ability—a many-sided word—is: usefulness to those above, to thosein control of one’s advancement.When one reads the speeches and reports of executives about the type of man thatis required, one cannot avoid this simple conclusion: he must ‘fit in’ withthose already at the top. This means that he must meet the expectations of hissuperiors and peers; that in personal manner and political view, in social waysand business style, he must be like those who are already in, and upon whosejudgments his own success rests. If it is to count in the corporate career,talent, no matter how defined, must be discovered by one’s talented superiors.It is in the nature of the morality of corporate accomplishment that those atthe top do not and cannot admire that which they do not and cannot understand.When it is asked of the top corporate men: ‘But didn’t they have to havesomething to get up there?’ The answer is, ‘Yes, they did.’ By definition, theyhad ‘what it takes.’ The real question accordingly is: what does it take? Andthe only answer one can find anywhere is: the sound judgment, as gauged by themen of sound judgment who select them. The fit survive, and fitness means, notformal competence—there probably is no such thing for top executivepositions—but conformity with the criteria of those who have already succeeded.To be compatible with the top men is to act like them, to look like them, tothink like them: to be of and for them—or at least to display oneself to them insuch a way as to create that impression. This, in fact, is what is meant by‘creating’—a well-chosen word—’a good impression.’ This is what is meant—andnothing else—by being a ‘sound man,’ as sound as a dollar.Since success depends upon personal or a clique choice, its criteria tend to beambiguous. Accordingly, those on the lower edge of the top stratum have amplemotive and opportunity to study carefully those above them as models, and toobserve critically and with no little anxiety those who are still their peers.Now they are above the approval of technical ability and formal competence,business experience and ordinary middle-class respectability. That is assumed.Now they are in the intangible, ambiguous world of the higher and inner circles,with whose members they must come into a special relation of mutual confidence.Not bureau cratic rules of seniority or objective examinations, but theconfidence of the inner circle that one is of them and for them, is aprerequisite for joining them.42 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en42]Of the many that are called to the corporate management, only a few are chosen.Those chosen are picked, not so much for strictly personal characteristics—whichmany of them cannot really be said to possess—as for qualities judged useful to‘the team.’ On this team, the prideful grace of individuality is not at apremium.Those who have started from on high have from their beginnings been formed bysound men and trained for soundness. They do not have to think of having toappear as sound men. They just are sound men; indeed, they embody the standardsof soundness. Those who have had low beginnings must think all the harder beforetaking a risk of being thought unsound. As they succeed, they must trainthemselves for success; and, as they are formed by it, they too come to embodyit, perhaps more rotundly than those of the always-high career. Thus, high orlow origin, each in its own way, operates to select and to form the sound menwith well-balanced judgment.It is the criteria of selection, it is the power to conform with and to usethese criteria that are important in understanding the chief executives—notmerely the statistics of origin. It is the structure of the corporate career andits inner psychological results that form the men at the top, not merely theexternal sequence of their career.So speak in the rich, round voice and do not confuse your superiors withdetails. Know where to draw the line. Execute the ceremony of forming ajudgment. Delay recognizing the choice you have already made, so as to make thetruism sound like the deeply pondered notion. Speak like the quiet competent manof affairs and never personally say No. Hire the No-man as well as the Yes-man.Be the tolerant Maybe-man and they will cluster around you, filled withhopefulness. Practice softening the facts into the optimistic, practical,forward-looking, cordial, brisk view. Speak to the well-blunted point. Haveweight; be stable: caricature what you are supposed to be but never become awareof it much less amused by it. And never let your brains show.6The criteria for executive advancement that prevail are revealingly displayed inthe great corporations’ recruitment and training programs, which reflect ratherclearly the criteria and judgments prevailing among those who have alreadysucceeded. Among today’s chief executives there is much worry about tomorrow’sexecutive elite, and there are many attempts to take inventory of the youngermen of the corporation who might develop in ten years or so; to hirepsychologists to measure talent and potential talent; for companies to bandtogether and set up classes for their younger executives, and indeed to employleading universities which arrange distinct schools and curricula for themanagers of tomorrow; in short, to make the selection of a managerial elite astaff function of the big company.Perhaps half of the large corporations now have such programs.43[ch15_notes.html#ch6en43] They send selected men to selected colleges andbusiness schools for special courses, Harvard Business School being a favorite.They set up their own schools and courses, often including their own topexecutives as lecturers. They scout leading colleges for promising graduates,and arrange tours of rotating duty for men selected as potential ‘comers.’ Somecorporations, in fact, at times seem less like businesses than vast schools forfuture executives.By such devices, the fraternity of the chosen have attempted to meet the needfor executives brought about by the corporate expansion of the ’forties and’fifties. This expansion occurred after the scarce job market of the ’thirties,when companies could pick and choose executives from among the experienced.During the war there was no time for such programs, which, on top of the slump,made for a decade-and-a-half gap in executive supply. Behind the deliberaterecruiting and training programs there is also the uneasy feeling among the topcliques that the second-level executives are not as broad-gauge as theythemselves: their programs are designed to meet the felt need for perpetuationof the corporate hierarchy.So the corporations conduct their raids among the college seniors, like collegefraternities among the freshmen. The colleges, in turn, have more and moreprovided courses thought to be helpful to the corporate career. It is reliablyreported that the college boys are ‘ready to be what the corporation wants themto be … They are looking hard for cues.’44 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en44] Such‘alertness and receptivity may well be a more important characteristic of themodern manager than the type of education he received. Luck obviously plays apart in the rise of any top executives, and they seem to manage to meet luckbetter than halfway.’45 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en45]The cues are readily available: As corporation trainees, the future executivesare detached from a central pool and slated for permanent jobs, ‘only after theyhave been given a strong indoctrination in what is sometimes called the“management view.” The indoctrination may last as long as two years andoccasionally as long as seven.’ Each year, for example, General Electric takesunto itself over 1,000 college graduates and exposes them for at least 45months, usually much longer, to a faculty of 250 full-time General Electricemployees. Many people are watching them, even their peers contribute to thejudging, for which, it is said, the trainee is grateful, for thus he will not beoverlooked. Training in ‘Human Relations’ pervades the broad-gauge program.‘Never say anything controversial,’ ‘You can always get anybody to do what youwish,’ are themes of the ‘effective presentation’ course worked up by the SalesTraining Department of the knowledgable corporation.In this human-relations type of training, the effort is to get people to feeldifferently as well as to think differently about their human problems. Thesensibilities and loyalties and character, not merely the skills, of the traineemust be developed in such a way as to transform the American boy into theAmerican executive. His very success will be an insulation of mind against theordinary problems and values of non-corporate people. Like all well-designedindoctrination courses, the social life of the trainee is built into theprogram: to get ahead one must get along, with one’s peers and with one’ssuperiors. All belong to the same fraternity; all of one’s ‘social needs can befilled within the company orbit.’ To find his executive slot in this orbit, the.trainee must ‘take advantage of the many contacts that rotation from place toplace affords.’ This too is company policy: ‘If you’re smart,’ says one smarttrainee, ‘as soon as you know your way around you start telephoning.’46[ch15_notes.html#ch6en46]There are many arguments pro and con about training programs for executives, butthe Crown-Prince type of program is a central argument among the top executivesof big corporations. Nine out of ten young men, even today, do not graduate fromcollege—they are excluded from such executive training schools, although most ofthem will work for corporations. What effects do such programs have among thosewho have been called to the corporation but are not among those chosen as CrownPrinces? Yet there must be some way to inflate the self-images of the futureexecutives in order that they may take up the reins with the proper mood and inthe proper manner and with the sound judgment required.The majority view of one small but significant sample of executives is that theman who knows ‘the technique of managing, not the content of what is managed,’the man who knows ‘how to elicit participative consultation … how to conductproblem-solving meetings …’ will be the top executive of the future.*[page_145.html#pg145fn1a] He will be a team player without unorthodox ideas,with leadership rather than drive. Or, as Fortune summarizes the argument:‘Their point goes something like this: We do need new ideas, a questioning ofaccepted ways. But the leader hires people to do this for him. For this reason,then, the creative qualities once associated with the line are now qualitiesbest put in staff slots. The top executive’s job, to paraphrase, is not to lookahead himself, but to check the excesses of the people who do look ahead. He isnot part of the basic creative engine; he is the governor.’ Or, as one executiveput it: ‘We used to look primarily for brilliance … Now that much abused word“character” has become very important. We don’t care if you’re a Phi Beta Kappaor a Tau Beta Phi. We want a well-rounded person who can handle well-roundedpeople.’48 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en48] Such a man does not invent ideas himself;he is a broker for well-rounded ideas: the decisions are made by thewell-rounded group.Lest all this be thought merely a whimsical fad, not truly reflecting theideological desert and anxiety of the executive world, consider sympatheticallythe style of conduct and the ideology of Owen D. Young—late president of GeneralElectric—who serves well as the American prototype of modern man as executive.In the early twentieth century, we are told by Miss Ida Tarbell, the typicalindustrial leader was a domineering individual, offensive in his belief thatbusiness was essentially a private endeavor. But not Owen Young. During WorldWar I and the ’twenties, he changed all that. To him, the corporation was apublic institution, and its leaders, although not of course elected by thepublic, were responsible trustees. ‘A big business in Owen D. Young’s mind isnot … a private business … it is an institution.’So he worked with people outside his own company, worked on an industry-widebasis, and laughed at ‘the fear that co-operation of any kind might be construedas conspiracy.’ In fact, he came to feel trade associations, in the corporateage, performed one role that once ‘the church,’ in a time of small businesses ina local county, performed: the role of moral restrainer, the keeper of ‘properbusiness practices.’ During the war, he became a kind of ‘general liaisonofficer between the company and various [government] boards, a kind of generalcounsel,’ a prototype of the many executives whose co-operation with one anotherduring the wars set the shape of peacetime co-operation as well.His interest in the properties he managed could not have been more personal hadhe owned them himself. Of one company he helped develop, he wrote to a friend:‘We have worked and played with it together so much that I feel sure it is notboasting to say that no one knows the strength and weakness—the good and badside of this property better than you and I. In fact I doubt if there were eversuch a great property which was known so well …’His face was always ‘friendly and approachable’ and his smile, one colleaguesaid, ‘his smile alone is worth a million dollars.’ Of his decision, it wassaid, ‘it was not logical document … It was something his colleagues felt wasintuitive rather than reasoned—a conclusion born of his pondering, and thoughyou might by rule and figures prove him wrong, you knew he was right!’49[ch15_notes.html#ch6en49]"},{"pageContent":"7THE CORPORATE RICHSIXTY glittering, clannish families do not run the American economy, nor hasthere occurred any silent revolution of managers who have expropriated thepowers and privileges of such families. The truth that is in both thesecharacterizations is less adequately expressed as ‘America’s Sixty Families’ or‘The Managerial Revolution,’ than as the managerial reorganization of thepropertied classes into the more or less unified stratum of the corporate rich.1[ch15_notes.html#ch7en1]As families and as individuals, the very rich are still very much a part of thehigher economic life of America; so are the chief executives of the majorcorporations. What has happened, I believe, is the reorganization of thepropertied class, along with those of higher salary, into a new corporate worldof privilege and prerogative. What is significant about this managerialreorganization of the propertied class is that by means of it the narrowindustrial and profit interests of specific firms and industries and familieshave been translated into the broader economic and political interests of a moregenuinely class type. Now the corporate seats of the rich contain all the powersand privileges inherent in the institutions of private property.The recent social history of American capitalism does not reveal any distinctbreak in the continuity of the higher capitalist class. There are, to be sure,accessions in each generation, and there is an unknown turnover rate; theproportions of given types of men differ from one epoch to the next. But overthe last half a century, in the economy as in the political order, there hasbeen a remarkable continuity of interests, vested in the types of highereconomic men who guard and advance them. The main drift of the upper classes,composed of several consistent trends, points unambiguously to the continuationof a world that is quite congenial to the continuation of the corporate rich.For in this stratum are now anchored the ultimate powers of big property whetherthey rest legally upon ownership or upon managerial control.The old-fashioned rich were simply the propertied classes, organized on a familybasis and seated in a locality, usually a big city. The corporate rich, inaddition to such people, include those whose high ‘incomes’ include theprivileges and prerogatives that have come to be features of high executiveposition. The corporate rich thus includes members of the big-city rich of themetropolitan 400, of the national rich who possess the great American fortunes,as well as chief executives of the major corporations. The propertied class, inthe age of corporate property, has become a corporate rich, and in becomingcorporate has consolidated its power and drawn to its defense new men of moreexecutive and more political stance. Its members have become self-conscious interms of the corporate world they represent. As men of status they have securedtheir privileges and prerogatives in the most stable private institutions ofAmerican society. They are a corporate rich because they depend directly, aswell as indirectly, for their money, their privileges, their securities, theiradvantages, their powers on the world of the big corporations. All theold-fashioned rich are now more or less of the corporate rich, and the newertypes of privileged men are there with them. In fact, no one can become rich orstay rich in America today without becoming involved, in one way or another, inthe world of the corporate rich.1During the ’forties and ’fifties, the national shape of the income distributionbecame less a pyramid with a flat base than a fat diamond with a bulging middle.Taking into account price changes and tax increases, proportionately morefamilies in 1929 than in 1951 (from 65 to 46 per cent) received family incomesof less than $3,000; fewer then than now received between $3,000 and $7,500(from 29 to 47 per cent); but about the same proportions (6 and 7 per cent) inboth 1929 and 1951 received $7,500 or more.* [page_148.html#pg148fn1a]2[ch15_notes.html#ch7en2]Many economic forces at work during the war, and the war-preparations boom thathas followed it, have made some people on the very bottom levels rise into whatused to be the middle-range income levels, and some of those who used to be inthe middle-range of income levels became upper-middle or upper. The changeddistribution of real income has thus affected the middle and lower levels of thepopulation, with which, of course, we are not here directly concerned. Ourinterest is in the higher levels; and the forces at work on the income structurehave not changed the decisive facts of the big money.At the very top of the mid-century American economy, there are some 120 peoplewho each year receive a million dollars or more. Just below them, another 379people appropriate between a half a million and a million. Some 1,383 people getfrom $250,000 to $499,999. And below all these, there is the broader base of11,490 people who receive from $100,000 to $249,999.Altogether, then, in 1949, there were 13,822 people who declared incomes of$100,000 or more to the tax collector.5 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en5] Let us draw theline of the openly declared corporate rich at that level: $100,000 a year andup. It is not an entirely arbitrary figure. For there is one fact about the fatdiamond that remains true regardless of how many people are on each of itslevels: on the middle and higher levels especially, the greater the yearlyincome, the greater the proportion of it from property, and the smaller theproportion from salaries, entrepreneurial withdrawal, or wages. The rich of thehigher incomes, in short, are still of the propertied class. The lower incomesderive from wages.* [page_150.html#pg150fn1a]One hundred thousand dollars a year is the income level on which property entersthe income picture in a major way: two-thirds (67 per cent) of the moneyreceived by the 13,702 people in the declared $100,000 and up to $999,999bracket comes from property—from dividends, capital gains, estates, and trusts.The remaining one-third is split between chief executives and top entrepreneurs.The higher you go into these upper reaches, the more does property count, andthe less does income for services performed. Thus 94 per cent of the money ofthe 120 people receiving a million dollars or more in 1949 came from property, 5per cent from entrepreneurial profits, 1 per cent from salaries. Among these 120people, there was considerable variation in the type of property from whichtheir money came.6 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en6] But, regardless of the legalarrangements involved, those with big incomes receive it overwhelmingly fromcorporate property. That is the first reason that all the rich are now corporaterich, and that is the key economic difference between the rich and the more than99 per cent of the population who are well below the $100,000 income level.In these tax-declared high-income classes, people come and go; every year theexact number of people varies. In 1929, when taxes were not so high as to makeit so dangerous as now to declare high incomes, there were about 1,000 more suchdeclarations than in 1949—a total of 14,816 declared incomes of $100,000 ormore. In 1948 there were 16,280; in 1939 only 2,921.7 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en7]But on the highest levels there remains throughout the years a hard core of thevery wealthy. Four-fifths of the 75 people who appropriated one million dollarsor more in 1924, for example, got one million or more in at least one other yearbetween 1917 and 1936. The chances are good that those who make it in one yearwill make it in another year or two.* [page_151.html#pg151fn1a] Farther down thepyramid, only 3 or 4 per cent of the population during the decade after WorldWar II have held as much as $10,000 in liquid assets.9 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en9]2Since virtually all statistics of income are based on declarations to taxcollectors, they do not fully reveal the ‘income’ differences between thecorporate rich and other Americans. In fact, one major difference has to do withprivileges that are deliberately created for the exclusion of ‘income’ from taxrecords. These privileges are so pervasive that we find it hard to takeseriously the great publicity given to the ‘income revolution,’ which is said tohave taken place over the last twenty years. A change, as we have just reported,has taken place in the total income distribution of the United States; but we donot find it very convincing to judge from declared income tax records that theshare the rich receive of all the wealth in the country has decreased.10[ch15_notes.html#ch7en10]Tax rates being high, the corporate rich are quite nimble in figuring out waysto get income, or the things and experiences that income provides, in such a wayas to escape taxation. The manner in which the corporate rich pay their taxes ismore flexible and provides more opportunities for shrewd interpretations of thelaw than is true for the middle and lower classes. People of higher incomefigure their own tax deductions, or more usually have them figured by theexperts they hire. Perhaps those whose income derives from property or fromentrepreneurial and professional practice are as honest—or as dishonest—aspoorer people on wages and salary, but they are also economically bolder, theyhave greater opportunities and greater skill, and, even more importantly, theyhave access to the very best skills available for such matters: accomplishedlawyers and skillful accountants who specialize in taxation as a science and agame. In the nature of the case, it would be impossible to prove withexactitude, but it is difficult not to believe that as a general rule the higherthe income and the more varied its sources, the greater the likelihood of theshrewd tax return. Much declared money is tricked, legally and illegally, fromthe tax collector; much illegal money is simply not declared.Perhaps the most important tax loophole in retaining current income is thelong-term capital gain. When a military man writes a best-seller or has itwritten for him, when a businessman sells his farm or a dozen pigs, when anexecutive sells his stock—the profit received is not considered as income but ascapital gain, which means that the profit to the individual after taxes isapproximately twice what it would have been if that same amount of money hadbeen received as a salary or a dividend. Individuals claiming long-term capitalgains pay taxes on only 50 per cent of that gain. The half that is taxed istaxed at a progressive rate applicable to a person’s total income; but themaximum tax on such gains is 52 per cent. This means that at no time can the taxpaid on these capital gains be more than 26 per cent of the total gain received;and it will be smaller if the total income, including the gain, leaves theindividual in a lower income tax bracket. But when the flow of money is turnedaround the other way, a capital loss of over $1,000 (those under $1,000 may bededucted from ordinary income) can be spread backward or forward in a five-yearspan to offset capital gains.Aside from capital gains, the most profitable tax loophole is perhaps the‘depletion allowance’ on oil and gas wells and mineral deposits. From 5 to 27½per cent of the gross income received on an oil well, but not exceeding 50 percent of the net income from the property, is tax-free each year. Moreover, allthe costs of drilling and developing an oil well can be deducted as theyoccur-instead of being capitalized and depreciated over the years of the well’sproductive life.11 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en11] The important point of privilegehas less to do with the percentage allowed than with the continuation of thedevice long after the property is fully depreciated.Those with enough money to play around may also off-set taxes by placing moneyin tax-free municipal bonds; they may split their income among various familymembers so that the taxes paid are at a lower rate than the combined incomewould have required. The rich cannot give away to friends or relatives more thana lifetime total of $30,000 plus $3,000 each year without paying a gift tax;although, in the name of both husband and wife, a couple can give twice thatamount. The rich man can also make a tax-deductible gift (up to 20 per cent ofyearly income that is given to recognized charities is not taxed as income) thatwill provide him security for the rest of his life. He can donate to a namedcharity the principal of a fund, but continue to receive the income from it.*[page_153.html#pg153fn1a] He thus makes an immediate deduction on his income taxreturn; and he cuts that part of his estate that is subject to inheritancetaxes.13 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en13]There are other techniques that help the rich preserve their money after theyare dead in spite of high estate taxes. For example, it is possible to set up atrust for a grandchild, and stipulate that the child receive the income from thetrust as long as he is alive, although the property legally belongs to thegrandchild. It is only at the death of the child (instead of both the originalowner and the child) that an estate tax is paid.A family trust saves taxes—both current income tax and estate tax levied upondeath—for income of the trust fund is taxed separately. In addition, the trustprovides the property holder with continuous professional management, eliminatesthe worries of responsibility, keeps the property intact in one manageable sum,builds the strongest possible legal safeguards to property, and, in effect,enables the owner to continue to control his property after he is dead.*[page_154.html#pg154fn1a]There are many kinds of trusts, and the law is rather complicated and strict intheir application; but in one type of short-term trust ‘what you do isIndian-give ownership of property to a trustee—and actually give away itsincome—for some set period (of more than 10 years). Then if the trust meets allother requirements, you’re clear of tax on that income.’15[ch15_notes.html#ch7en15]Twenty-five years ago, there were no more than 250 foundations in the entireUnited States; today there are thousands. Generally, a foundation is defined as‘any autonomous, non-profit legal entity that is set up to “serve the welfare ofmankind.” It administers wealth that is transferred to it through tax-free giftsor bequests.’ Actually, the setting up of foundations has often become aconvenient way of avoiding taxes, ‘operating as private banks for their donors;not infrequently, the “mankind” they have served turned out to be a few indigentrelatives.’ The Revenue Act of 1950 tried ‘to plug up some of the biggerloopholes’ but ‘dubious foundations still have an advantage—the tax collectorhas a hard time getting information about them … revenue men complain theyhaven’t time or manpower to check more than a tiny fraction of the reportsalready filed by foundations. They have to steer largely by instinct in decidingwhich ones to investigate,’ and even the 1950 law does not require that allpertinent data concerning them be furnished to the government.In recent years, more businesses have been creating foundations, thus making abid for local and national good will, while encouraging research in their ownindustries. The corporation so engaged does not have to pay taxes on the 5 percent of its profits that it yearly gives to its foundation. Very rich familiesalso can keep control of their business after a death in the family by givinglarge shares of the company stock to a foundation (Ford is unusual in thisrespect only in the magnitude of the sums involved). The size of the inheritancetax, which might otherwise force a sale of stock to outsiders in order to paythe taxes, is reduced. ‘If a man’s chief concern is to raise a tax-free umbrellaover part of his income and to give some jobs to needy retainers,’ an alertbusiness magazine advises its executive readers, ‘he should by all means set uphis own foundation, no matter how small. Then he may even prefer to have theoverhead eat up all the income.’16 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en16]For virtually every law taxing big money, there is a way those with big moneycan avoid it or minimize it. But such legal and illegal maneuvers are only partof the income privileges of the corporate rich: working hand-in-hand with therules and regulations of the government, the corporations find ways directly tosupplement the income of the executive rich. These various forms of featheringthe nest now make it possible for executive members of the corporate rich tolive richly on seemingly moderate incomes, while paying taxes lower than the lawseemingly intends as fair and just. Among such privileged arrangements arefollowing:Under the deferred pay contract, the corporation signs up for a given salary fora number of years, and further agrees to pay an annual retainer after retirementas long as the executive doesn’t go to work for any competing firm. Theexecutive’s loyalty is thus linked to the company, and he is able to spread hisincome into the years when lower earnings will result in reduced taxes. OneChrysler executive, for example, recently signed a contract yielding him$300,000 a year for the next five years, then $75,000 a year for the rest of hislife. A recently retired Chairman of U. S. Steel’s Board, who was receiving a$211,000 salary, now gets $14,000 a year as his pension, plus $55,000 a year in‘deferred pay.’17 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en17]The classic case of deferred payment is perhaps the one worked out for a famousentertainer, who was in a position to demand $500,000 a year for 3 years.‘Instead, he arranged to take $50,000 a year for the next 30 years. No oneseriously expects him to be active in show business when he is approaching 80,but by spreading out his income and keeping it in lower tax brackets he was ableto cut the total income tax he will have to pay by nearly $600,000, according toone estimate.’18 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en18] Such fabulous arrangements are notlimited to the world of show business, even though there they may be morepublicized: Even the most respected and staid companies are now in manyinstances taking care of their key people by such means.Executives are given restricted options to buy stock at or below current marketvalue. This keeps the executive with the company; for he is able to pick up theoption only after a specified period of time such as a year, or he may only beable to use it to buy limited quantities of stock over a longer period oftime—say five years.19 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en19] To the executive as risklessentrepreneur, at the time he picks up his option, there comes an immediateprofit (the difference between the option price previously set and the marketvalue of the stock at the time when he buys it). Most of the profit he makes ifhe later sells the stock is not considered taxable income by an obliginggovernment: it is taxed at the lower capital gains rate. Nothing prevents himfrom borrowing money to pick up his option, and then selling the stock in sixmonths at the higher market value. For example, in 1954, the president of anaircraft company was given—in salary, bonus, and pension credits—about $150,000,but after taxes he took home only about $75,000. However, if he wished to sellthe 10,000 shares of stock he had bought on his company’s option plan severalmonths before, he could, after paying all taxes due, have also taken home$594,375.20 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en20] About one out of six companies listed onthe New York Stock Exchange gave stock options to executives within a year or soafter the 1950 tax law made them attractive as capital gains. Since then, thepractice has spread.21 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en21]3The corporate rich are a propertied rich, but big property is not all that theypossess; the corporate rich are able to accumulate and to retain high incomes,but high incomes are not all they accumulate for keeps. In addition to bigproperty and high income, they enjoy the corporate privileges that are part ofthe newer status system of the incorporated economy of the United States. Thesestatus privileges of the corporate rich are now standard practices, essential,even though shifting, features of business-as-usual, part of the going pay-offfor success. Criticism of them does not arouse indignation on the part of anyonein a position voluntarily to do anything about them, and much less about thecorporate system in which they are firmly anchored.None of these privileges are revealed by examination of the yearly income or theproperty holding. They are, one might say, fringe benefits of the highercircles. The ‘fringe benefits’ which lower salaried and wage earners have beengiven—primarily private pension and welfare plans, social security andunemployment insurance—have risen from 1.1 per cent of the national payroll in1929 to 5.9 per cent in 1953.22 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en22] It is not possible tocalculate with suitable precision the ‘fringe benefits’ taken by the risk-lessentrepreneurs of the big corporations, but it is now certain that they havebecome quite central to the higher emoluments. It is because of them that thecorporate rich may be considered, in a decisive way, to be members of a directlyprivileged class. The corporations from which their property and incomes deriveare also the seats of the privileges and prerogatives. The great variety ofthese privileges substantially increases their standard of consumption,buttresses their financial position against the ups and downs of the economicsystem, lends shape to their whole style of living, and lifts them into asecurity as great as that of the corporate economy itself. Designed to increasethe wealth and the security of the rich in a manner that avoids the payment oftaxes, they also strengthen their loyalties to the corporations.23[ch15_notes.html#ch7en23]Among the accoutrements that often go with the big executive job but are neverreported to tax collectors are such fringe benefits as these: free medical care,payments of club fees, company lawyers and accountants available for tax,financial and legal advice, facilities for entertaining customers, privaterecreation areas—golf courses, swimming pools, gymnasiums—scholarship funds forchildren of executives, company automobiles, and dining rooms for executiveuse.24 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en24] By 1955, some 37 per cent of all the Cadillacregistrations in Manhattan, and 20 per cent in Philadelphia, were in companynames.25 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en25] ‘A company dedicated to keeping its officershappy,’ one reliable observer recently noted, ‘can with all propriety have acompany airplane for business trips and a yacht and a hunting-fishing lodge inthe north woods to entertain its biggest customers.* [page_158.html#pg158fn1a]It can also arrange to hold its conventions in Miami in midwinter. The effect,as far as company executives go, is to provide wonderful travel and vacationfacilities without cost. The company officers go south in the winter and northby summer; take along enough work or enough customers to justify the trip, andproceed to have a very pleasant time of it … At home the executives can alsoride around in company-owned and chauffeured automobiles. Naturally the companyis happy to pay their dues at the best available country club, for the purposesof entertaining customers on the golf course, and at the best town club, forintimate lunches and dinners.’27 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en27] You name it and youcan find it. And it is increasing: it is free to the executive, and deductibleas an ordinary business expense by the corporation.These higher emoluments may also extend to lavish gifts of wonderful toys foradults, like automobiles and fur coats, and conveniences like deep freezes forthe purchasing agents and business contacts not directly employed by thecompany. All this has been widely publicized and decried in the politicalfield,** [page_158.html#pg158fn2a] but, as any business executive of staturewell knows, such gifts of business friendship are standard practice within andespecially between big firms.Back in 1910, for example, White Sulphur Springs in the hills of West Virginiawas on the same social circuit as Bar Harbor and Newport. In 1954, theChesapeake and Ohio Railroad, which owns the Greenbrier resort hotel in WhiteSulphur Springs, invited as guests top level executives who are, in fact orpotentially, important shippers and who feel honored to be invited. In 1948, theC & O paid for everything, but the response was so great from the business,social, and political celebrities who accepted the invitation that they now comeon their own expense accounts. The resort operates year-round but the SpringFestival is the big social-business event.29 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en29]In Florida, there is now being constructed an entire resort town, with anaverage population of 3,000, which will be rented to executives and their guestson a year-round basis. The companies involved can either sublet it to theiremployees or write off the cost as a business-expense deduction during the timesit is used for entertaining customers, holding conventions or importantconferences.30 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en30]The Continental Motors Corporation operates duck-hunting expeditions at LostIsland, Arkansas. Assuming that the golf, cocktail, dinner, and night clubroutine is ‘old-hat’ to any executive by the time he is big enough to be animportant customer, Continental set up a ‘customer relations program’ which hasbeen going some fifteen years. Such ‘lodge-type’ selling retreats areconcentrated in the primary goods industries, where the big sales are made,president to president,. rather than in consumer goods. Everyone on the hunt is‘a president or a vice-president, or maybe a general or an admiral.’ In the samevicinity, at least three other corporations also operate exclusive duck-huntingclubs. Top employees as well as clients are usually among the guests at suchduck, deer, and trout facilities.31 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en31]More widely recognized, but still not seriously studied is the wide-ranging andfar-reaching fact of the expense account. No one knows, and there is no way tofind out for sure, just how much of high living and exciting entertainment ismade possible for the new privileged classes solely because of the expenseaccount. ‘The vice-president of one firm,’ economist Richard A. Girard recentlyreported, ‘is assigned a flat $20,000 each year to cover any entertaining he maydecide to do. His contract specifies that he does not have to account for themoney.’32 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en32] Tax officials play a continual game withmembers of the corporate rich over expense-account deductions but generallyinsist that each case is unique—which means there are no set rules and therevenue agent has wide responsibility.‘Theatre people estimate that thirty to forty per cent of the New York theatreaudience is an expense-account audience, and that this is the percentage betweenlife and death.’33 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en33] Moreover, ‘in cities like New York,Washington and Chicago,’ one investigator feels it ‘safe to say that at anygiven moment well over half of all the people in the best hotels, the bestnightclubs and the best restaurants are charging the bill as an expense accountitem to their companies, which in turn are charging it to the government in theform of tax deductions’—and goes on to assert what is well known: ‘There issomething about an expense account that brings out the latent rascality,rapacity and mendacity in even the otherwise most honorable man. Expense accountforms have long been known affectionately by their fond possessors as “swindlesheets.” Filling out an expense account itemization has been regarded as a kindof contest of wits with the company auditor, in which it is perfectlyjustifiable to use the most outrageous half-truths, little white lies andoutright fantasies, anything at all which the auditor, regardless of howoutraged he might be, cannot absolutely prove to be false.’34[ch15_notes.html#ch7en34]We have by no means reported all of the privileges of the corporate rich,confining ourselves mainly to legally and officially sanctioned types. Many ofthe new privileges—especially the higher emoluments—have long been known and arequite accepted by heads of state and by higher officials of public office. Thegovernor is given ‘the governor’s mansion’ in which to live rent free; thepresident, with $50,000 a year tax-free expenses, also has his White House,which contains his serviced living quarters as well as offices ofadministration. But what has happened, as the corporation has become the anchorpoint for the privileges that go with great wealth, is that such higheremoluments have become normal among the private rich as they have becometransformed into the corporate rich. When, in their happier moods, corporationexecutives speak lovingly of their corporations as One Big Family, one canunderstand that in a very real sense they are asserting a sociological truthabout the class structure of American society. For the powers and privileges ofproperty, shared among the corporate rich, are now collective, and theindividual has such privileges most securely only in so far as he is part of thecorporate world.4America has not become a country where individual pleasures and powers arebounded by small incomes and high taxes. There are incomes high enough to remainhigh despite the taxes and there are many ways of escaping and minimizing taxes.There is maintained in America, and there is being created and maintained everyyear, a stratum of the corporate rich, many of whose members possess far moremoney than they can personally spend with any convenience. For many of them, theprices of things are simply irrelevant. They never have to look at the righthand column of a menu; they never have to take orders from anybody, they neverhave to do really disagreeable things except as a self-imposed task; they neverhave to face alternatives hedged in by considerations of cost. They never haveto do anything. They are, according to all appearances, free.But are they really free?The answer is Yes, within the terms of their society, they are really free.But does not the possession of money somehow limit them?The answer is No, it does not.But are not those just the hurried answers, are there not more considered,deeper-going answers?What kind of deeper-going answers? And what does freedom mean? Whatever else itmay mean, freedom means that you have the power to do what you want to do, whenyou want to do it, and how you want to do it. And in American society the powerto do what you want, when you want, how you want, requires money. Money providespower and power provides freedom.But are there no limits on all this?Of course there are limits to the power of money, and the freedoms based on thatpower. And there are also psychological traps for the rich, as among misers andspendthrifts on all levels, which distort their capacity for freedom.The miser enjoys the possession of money as such. The spendthrift enjoys thespending of money as such. Neither—in the pure type—can look upon money as ameans to free and various ends of life, whatever they may be. The miser’spleasure is in the potentiality of his spending power, so he draws back from theactual spending. He is a tense man, afraid of losing the potentiality and sonever realizing it. His security and his power are embodied in his hoard, and infearing to lose it, he fears loss of his very self. He is not merely a stingyman, nor necessarily a merely avaricious man. He is an impotent voyeur of theeconomic system, one for whom the possession of money for its own sake, and notas a means to any further end, has become the end of life. He cannot completethe economic act. And money, which to most economic men is a means, becomes tothe miser a despotic end.The spendthrift, oil the other hand, is a man for whom the act of spending isitself a source of pleasure. He does not feel happy on a spending spree becauseof his expected ease or pleasure from the goods acquired. The act of senselessspending is in itself his pleasure and reward. And in this act the spendthriftadvertises his unconcern with mere money. He consumes conspicuously to show thathe is above pecuniary considerations, thus revealing how highly he values them.No doubt both of these oddities of the money system are available among theAmerican rich today, but they are not typical. For most members of the corporaterich money remains a gratifying medium of exchange—a pure and unadulteratedmeans to an enormous variety of concrete ends. For most of them, money is valuedfor what it will purchase in comfort and fun, status and alcoholism, securityand power and experience, freedom and boredom.On the bottom level of the money system one never has enough money, which is thekey link in the hand-to-mouth way of existence. One is, in a sense, below themoney system—never having enough money to be firmly a part of it.On the middle levels, the money system often seems an endless treadmill. Onenever gets enough; $8,000 this year seems to place one in no better straits thandid $6,000 the last. There are suspicions among people on such levels, that werethey to make $15,000, they would still be on the treadmill, trapped in the moneysystem.But above a certain point in the scale of wealth, there is a qualitative break:the rich come to know that they have so much that they simply do not have tothink about money at all: it is only they who have truly won the money game;they are above the struggle. It is not too much to say that in a pecuniarysociety, only then are men in a position to be free. Acquisition as a form ofexperience and all that it demands no longer need to be a chain. They can beabove the money system, above the scramble on the treadmill: for them it is nolonger true that the more they have, the harder it seems to make ends meet. Thatis the way we define the rich as personal consumers.For the very poor, the ends of necessity never meet. For the middle classesthere are always new ends, if not of necessity, of status. For the very rich,the ends have never been separated, and within the limits of the common humanspecies, they are today as free as any Americans.The idea that the millionaire finds nothing but a sad, empty place at the top ofthis society; the idea that the rich do not know what to do with their money;the idea that the successful become filled up with futility, and that those bornsuccessful are poor and little as well as rich—the idea, in short, of thedisconsolateness of the rich—is, in the main, merely a way by which those whoare not rich reconcile themselves to the fact. Wealth in America is directlygratifying and directly leads to many further gratifications.To be truly rich is to possess the means of realizing in big ways one’s littlewhims and fantasies and sicknesses. ‘Wealth has great privileges,’ Balzac onceremarked, ‘and the most enviable of them all is the power of carrying outthoughts and feelings to the uttermost; of quickening sensibility by fulfillingits myriad caprices.’35 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en35] The rich, like other men, areperhaps more simply human than otherwise. But their toys are bigger; they havemore of them; they have more of them all at once.* [page_164.html#pg164fn1a]As for the happiness of the rich, that is a matter that can be neither provednor disproved. Still, we must remember that the American rich are the winnerswithin a society in which money and money-values are the supreme stakes. If therich are not happy it is because none of us are happy. Moreover, to believe thatthey are unhappy would probably be un-American. For if they are not happy, thenthe very terms of success in America, the very aspirations of all sound men,lead to ashes rather than fruit.Even if everyone in America, being human, were miserable, that would be notreason to believe that the rich were more miserable. And if everyone is happy,surely that is no reason to believe that the rich are excluded from the generalAmerican bliss. If those who win the game for which the entire society seemsdesigned are not ‘happy,’ are then those who lose the happy ones? Must webelieve that only those who live within, but not of, the American society can behappy? Were it calamitous to lose, and horrible to win, then the game of successwould indeed be a sad game, doubly so in that it is a game everyone in and ofthe American culture cannot avoid playing. For to withdraw is of courseobjectively to lose, and to lose objectively, although subjectively to believeone has not lost—that borders on insanity. We simply must believe that theAmerican rich are happy, else our confidence in the whole endeavor might beshaken. For of all the possible values of human society, one and one only istruly sovereign, truly universal, truly sound, truly and completely acceptablegoal of man in America. That goal is money, and let there be no sour grapesabout it from the losers.‘He is king …’ one of Balzac’s characters proclaims, ‘he can do what he chooses;he is above everything, as all rich men are. To him, henceforth, the expression:“All Frenchmen are equal before the law,” is the lie inscribed at the head of acharter. He will not obey the laws, the laws will obey him. There is noscaffold, no headsman, for millionaires!’‘Yes, there is,’ replied Raphael, ‘they are their own headsmen!’‘Another prejudice,’ cried the banker.37 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en37]5The newer privileges of the corporate rich have to do with the power of money inthe sphere of consumption and personal experience. But the power of money, theprerogatives of economic position, the social and political weight of corporateproperty, is by no means limited to the sphere of accumulation and consumption,corporate or personal. In fact, from the standpoint of the American elite, ofwhich the corporate rich are only one segment, the power over consumer goods isnot nearly so important as the institutional powers of wealth.I. The Constitution is the sovereign political contract of the United States. Byits fourteenth amendment it gives due legal sanction to the corporations, nowthe seat of the corporate rich, managed by the executives among them. Within thepolitical framework of the nation, this corporate elite constitutes a set ofgoverning groups, a hierarchy developed and run from the economic top down. Thechief executives are now at the head of the corporate world, which in turn is aworld of economic sovereignty within the nation’s politically sovereign area. Inthem is vested the economic initiative, and they know it and they feel it to betheir prerogative. As chiefs of the industrial manorialism, they have lookedreluctantly to the federal government’s social responsibility for the welfare ofthe underlying population. They view workers and distributors and suppliers oftheir corporate systems as subordinate members of their world, and they viewthemselves as individuals of the American individualistic sort who have reachedthe top.They run the privately incorporated economy. It cannot be said that thegovernment has interfered much during the last decade, for in virtually everycase of regulation that we examine the regulating agency has tended to become acorporate outpost.38 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en38] To control the productivefacilities is to control not only things but the men who, not owning property,are drawn to it in order to work. It is to constrain and to manage their life atwork in the factory, on the railroad, in the office. It is to determine theshape of the labor market, or to fight over that shape with union or government.It is to make decisions in the name of the enterprise as to how much to produceof what and when and how to produce it and how much to charge for it.II. Money allows the economic power of its possessor to be translated directlyinto political party causes. In the eighteen-nineties, Mark Hanna raised moneyfrom among the rich for political use out of the fright caused by WilliamJennings Bryan and the Populist ‘nightmare’; and many of the very rich have beenunofficial advisers to politicians. Mellons, Pews, and du Ponts have long beencampaign contributors of note, and, in the post-World War II period, the Texasmillionaires have contributed sizable amounts of money in campaigns across thenation. They have helped McCarthy in Wisconsin, Jenner in Indiana, Butler andBeall in Maryland. In 1952, for example, one oil tycoon (Hugh Roy Cullen) madethirty-one contributions of from $500 to $5,000 each (totaling at least$53,000), and his two sons-in-law helped out (at least $19,750 more) tenCongressional candidates. It is said that the Texas multimillionaires now usetheir money in the politics of at least thirty states. Murchison has contributedto political candidates outside Texas since 1938, although he got no publicityuntil 1950, when he and his wife, at Joseph McCarthy’s request, contributed$10,000 to defeat Senator Tydings of Maryland, and in 1952 sent money to beatMcCarthy’s Connecticut foe, Senator William Benton.39 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en39]In 1952, ‘the six top Republican and Democratic political committees received 55per cent of their total receipts [this includes only those receipts of groupsthat spent money in two or more states] in 2,407 contributions of $1,000 ormore.’* [page_166.html#pg166fn1a] Such figures are absolute minimums since manycontributions can be made by family members of different names, not easilyrecognized by the reporters.III. But it is not so much by direct campaign contributions that the wealthyexert political power. And it is not so much the very rich as the corporateexecutives—the corporate reorganizers of the big propertied class—who havetranslated the power of property into political use. As the corporate world hasbecome more intricately involved in the political order, these executives havebecome intimately associated with the politicians, and especially with the key‘politicians’ who form the political directorate of the United Statesgovernment.The nineteenth-century economic man, we are accustomed to believe, was a shrewd‘specialist’ in bargaining and haggling. But the growth of the great corporationand the increased intervention of government into the economic realm haveselected and formed and privileged economic men who are less hagglers andbargainers on any market than professional executives and adroit economicpoliticians. For today the successful economic man, either as propertied manageror manager of property, must influence or control those positions in the statein which decisions of consequence to his corporate activities are made. Thistrend in economic men is, of course, facilitated by war, which thus creates theneed to continue corporate activities with political as well as the economicmeans. War is of course the health of the corporate economy; during war thepolitical economy tends to become more unified, and moreover, politicallegitimations of the most unquestionable sort—national security itself—aregained for corporate economic activities.‘Before World War I, businessmen fought each other; after the war they combinedto present a united front against consumers.’41 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en41] DuringWorld War II they served on innumerable advisory committees in the prosecutionof the war. They were also brought into the military apparatus more permanentlyby the awarding to many businessmen of commissions in the reserve officercorps.* [page_168.html#pg168fn1a] All this has been going on for a long time andis rather well known, but in the Eisenhower administration the corporateexecutives publicly assumed the key posts of the executive branch of thegovernment. Where before the more silent power and the ample contract was there,now there was also the loud voice.Is there need for very subtle analysis of such matters when the Secretary of theInterior, Douglas McKay, blurted out to his friends in the Chamber of Commerce,on 29 April 1953, ‘We’re here in the saddle as an Administration representingbusiness and industry?’43 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en43] Or when Secretary of DefenseWilson asserted the identity of interests between the United States of Americaand the General Motors Corporation? Such incidents may be political blunders—orwould be, were there an opposition party—but are they not as well revelations ofdeeply held convictions and intentions?There are executives who are as afraid of such political identification as‘non-partisan’ labor leaders are of third parties. For a long time the corporaterich had been in training as an opposition group; the brighter ones then came tofeel vaguely that they might be on the spot. Before Eisenhower, such power asthey wielded could more easily be politically irresponsible. After Eisenhowerthat is not so easy. If things go wrong, will not they—and with them business—beblamed?But John Knox Jessup, chairman of the editorial board of Fortune, feels that thecorporation can supplant the archaic system of states as a framework forself-government—and thus fill the vacuum of the middle levels of power. For, aschief of the corporate commonwealth, the manager has the political job ofkeeping all his constituents reasonably happy. Mr. Jessup argues that thebalances of economic and political domains have already broken down: ‘AnyPresident who wants to run a prosperous country depends on the corporation atleast as much as—probably more than—the corporation depends on him. Hisdependence is not unlike that of King John on the landed barons of Runnymede,where Magna Carta was born.’44 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en44]In general, however, the ideology of the executives, as members of the corporaterich, is conservatism without any ideology. They are conservative, if for noother reason than that they feel themselves to be a sort of fraternity of thesuccessful. They are without ideology because they feel themselves to be‘practical’ men. They do not think up problems; they respond to alternativespresented to them, and such ideology as they have must be inferred from suchresponses as they make.During the last three decades, since the First World War in fact, thedistinction between the political and the economic man has been diminishing;although the corporation managers have, in the past, distrusted one of their ownwho stays too long in the political arena. They like to come and go, for thenthey are not responsible. Yet more and more of the corporate executives haveentered government directly; and the result has been a virtually new politicaleconomy at the apex of which we find those who represent the corporate rich.*[page_169.html#pg169fn1a]The questions which these obvious facts of the political power of the corporaterich raise have to do not so much with the personal integrity of the meninvolved, and certainly not so much with their personal gains in wealth,prestige, and power. These are important questions which we shall discuss whenwe note the general prevalence of the higher immorality and the structure of thepower elite as a whole. But the important political question is whether or notthese facts can be added up to proof of a structural connection between thecorporate rich and what we shall call the political directorate.Have the very rich and the top executives, the upper classes of local societyand of the metropolitan 400, the strategic cliques of the corporate world,actually occupied many positions of power within the formal political system?They have, of course, made raids upon the government, they have gainedprivileges within it. But have they been and are they now active politically?Contrary to official legend, scholarly myth, and popular folklore, the answer tothat question is a complicated but a quite definite Yes.We should, however, be quite mistaken to believe that the political apparatus ismerely an extension of the corporate world, or that it has been taken over bythe representatives of the corporate rich. The American government is not, inany simple way nor as a structural fact, a committee of ‘the ruling class.’ Itis a network of ‘committees,’ and other men from other hierarchies besides thecorporate rich sit in these committees. Of these, the professional politicianhimself is the most complicated, but the high military, the warlords ofWashington, are the newest."},{"pageContent":"8THE WARLORDSDURING the eighteenth century, observers of the historic scene began to notice aremarkable trend in the division of power at the top of modern society:Civilians, coming into authority, were able to control men of military violence,whose power, being hedged in and neutralized, declined. At various times andplaces, of course, military men had been the servants of civilian decision, butthis trend—which reached its climax in the nineteenth century and lasted untilWorld War I—seemed then, and still seems, remarkable simply because it had neverbefore happened on such a scale or never before seemed so firmly grounded.In the twentieth century, among the industrialized nations of the world, thegreat, brief, precarious fact of civilian dominance began to falter; andnow—after the long peace from the Napoleonic era to World War I—the old march ofworld history once more asserts itself. All over the world, the warlord isreturning. All over the world, reality is defined in his terms. And in America,too, into the political vacuum the warlords have marched. Alongside thecorporate executives and the politicians, the generals and admirals—those uneasycousins within the American elite—have gained and have been given increasedpower to make and to influence decisions of the gravest consequence.1All politics is a struggle for power; the ultimate kind of power is violence.Why, then, is not military dictatorship the normal and usual form of government?For the greater part of human history, men have, in fact, lived under the sword,and in any serious disturbance of human affairs, real or imagined, societies dotend to revert to military rule. Even nowadays, we often overlook these more orless common facts of world history because we inherit certain values which,during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, have flourished under a regimeof civilian authority. Even if the ultimate form of power is coercion byviolence, all power contests within and between nations of our tradition havenot reached the ultimate point. Our theories of government have assumed and ourconstitution has led to institutions in which violence has been minimized andsubjected to efficient checks in the balance of civilian dominance. During thelong peace of the modern west, history has been referred more to the politician,to the rich and to the lawyer than to the general, the bandit, and the admiral.But how did that peace come about? How did civilians rather than men of violencebecome dominant?In his discusion of the military, Gaetano Mosca1 [ch15_notes.html#ch8en1] makesan assumption which we do not share, but which does not disturb our acceptanceof his general line of reasoning. He assumes that, in any society, there is asort of quota of men who when appropriately provoked will resort to violence.If, says Mosca, we give such men genius and the historical opportunity, we willget a Napoleon; if we give them a great ideal, we will get a Garibaldi; if wegive them a chance, and nothing else, we will get a Mussolini or, we may add, ina business civilization, a gangster.But, says Mosca, if you give such a man a job in a certain kind of socialhierarchy, you will get a professional soldier and often civilians can controlhim.Of course, there have been bases of internal peace other than the professionalstanding army. There has been ‘God’s peace’ imposed by a priesthood, and the‘King’s Peace’ imposed in medieval Europe against those who felt that theirhonor and power depended upon the sword. But the big fact about peace in modern,or even in world history, is—as one might expect—an ambiguous fact: it is thatpeace has been due to the centralization and monopoly of violence by thenational state, but that the existence of a world now organized into someeighty-one such national states is also the prime condition of modern war.Before the national state, men of violence could and did frequently resort toviolence on a local scale, and feudalism in Europe as well as in the Orient wasin many ways a local rule by men of violence. Before the national statecentralized and monopolized the means of violence, power tended continually tore-create itself in small, scattered centers, and rule by local gangs was oftena going fact of the pre-national history of mankind. But the highwayman of Spainbecame—under Ferdinand and Isabella who were building a nation—a man of thecrown, and in due course a conquistador and in due course again, a soldier ofthe queen. The man of local violence came, in short, to be a member of anational standing army beholden to the civilian head of the state.Now what kind of remarkable institution is this standing army that it canchannel the combative tendencies of men of violence so that they come undercivilian authority, and in fact adopt among themselves such obedience as theirvery code of honor? For if the standing army, in the modern nation, has come tomonopolize violence, to become strong enough to dominate society, why has it notdone so? Why, instead, has it quite frequently tapered up to and accepted thecivilian authority of the civilian head of the state? Why do armies subordinatethemselves? What are the secrets of the standing army?There are no secrets, there are several quite open mechanisms which have been atwork wherever standing armies are under civilian control. First of all, thesearmies have been ‘aristocratic’ kinds of institutions. Whenever, as in the earlyBolshevik enthusiasm, attempts have been made to do away with this character,they have failed. There is maintained in the national standing army an absolutedistinction between officers and men; and the officer group has generally beenrecruited from among the ruling strata of the civilian population or from thosewho sympathize with their interests; accordingly, the balance of forces withinthe ruling strata has been reflected within the standing army. And finally,there have developed in this standing army, or in many of them, certaingratifications which even men of violence often want: the security of a job, butmore, the calculable glory of living according to a rigid code of honor.‘Is it to be supposed,’ John Adams asked in the late eighteenth century, ‘thatthe regular standing armies of Europe, engage in the service, from pure motivesof patriotism? Are their officers men of contemplation and devotion, who expecttheir reward in a future life? Is it from a sense of moral, or religious dutythat they risk their lives, and reconcile themselves to wounds? Instances of allthese kinds may be found. But if any one supposes that all, or the greater partof these heroes, are actuated by such principles, he will only prove that he isunacquainted with them. Can their pay be considered as an adequateencouragement? This, which is no more than a very simple and moderatesubsistence, would never be a temptation to renounce the chances of fortune inother pursuits, together with the pleasures of domestic life, and submit to thismost difficult and dangerous employment. No, it is the consideration and thechances of laurels, which they acquire by the service.‘The soldier compares himself with his fellows, and contends for promotion to bea Corporal: the Corporals vie with each other to be Sergeants: the Sergeantswill mount breaches to be Ensigns: and thus every man in an army is constantlyaspiring to be something higher, as every citizen in the commonwealth isconstantly struggling for a better rank, that he may draw the observation ofmore eyes.’2 [ch15_notes.html#ch8en2]Prestige to the point of honor, and all that this involves, has, as it were,been the pay-off for the military’s renunciation of political power. Thisrenunciation has gone quite far: it has been incorporated in the military codeof honor. Inside their often trim bureaucracy, where everything seems under neatcontrol, army officers have felt that ‘politics’ is a dirty, uncertain, andungentle-manly kind of game; and in terms of their status code, they have oftenfelt that politicians were unqualified creatures inhabiting an uncertain world.The status mechanisms of the standing army have not always worked to the end ofcivilian dominance, and there is nothing inevitable about their working to thatend. We know, for example, that the curse of the nations of the Spanish worldhas been the fact that whenever army officers have gotten a foothold in thecouncils of state, they have tried to dominate them, and that when they have nofoothold in those councils, they may march upon the capital.2All of these reflections, having to do with world trends and world facts, bearin an especially acute way on the situation of the American militaryestablishment and its higher echelons of generals and admirals. Like othernations, the United States was born in violence, but it was born at a time whenwarfare did not seem to be a dominating feature of human society. And it wasborn in a place which could not easily be reached by the machines of war, wasnot easily open to the devastation of war, not subject to the anxiety of thosewho live in military neighborhoods. In the time and place of its earlier period,the United States was well situated to erect and to maintain a civiliangovernment, and to hold well subordinated such militarist ambition as mightprevail.A young country whose nationalist revolution was fought against mercenarysoldiers, employed by the British and quartered in American homes, would not belikely to love professional soldiers. Being a wide, open land surrounded by weakneighbors, Indians and wide oceans, the sovereign United States for the longdecades of the nineteenth century did not have to carry the burden of apermanent and large military overhead. Moreover, from the time of the MonroeDoctrine until it was applied to Britain in the later part of the nineteenthcentury, the British fleet, in order to protect British markets in the westernhemisphere, stood between the United States and the continental states ofEurope. Even after World War I, until the rise of Nazi Germany, the America thathad become creditor to the bankrupt nations of Europe had little military threatto fear.3 [ch15_notes.html#ch8en3] All this has also meant that, as in theislands of Britain, a navy rather than an army was historically the primemilitary instrument; and navies have much less influence upon national socialstructures than armies often have, for they are not very useful as a means ofrepressing popular revolt. Generals and admirals, accordingly, did not play muchof a role in political affairs and civilian dominance was firmly set.A country whose people have been most centrally preoccupied by the individualacquisition of wealth would not be expected to favor subsidizing an organizedbody of men who, economically speaking, are parasitical. A country whose middleclass cherished freedom and personal initiative would not be likely to esteemdisciplined soldiers who all too often seemed to be tyrannically used in thesupport of less free governments. Economic forces and political climate,therefore, have historically favored the civilian devaluation of the military asan at-times necessary evil but always a burden.The Constitution of the United States was constructed in fear of a powerfulmilitary establishment. The President, a civilian, was declaredcommander-in-chief of all the armed forces, and during war, of the statemilitia’s as well. Only Congress could declare war, or vote funds for militaryuse—and for only two years at a time. The individual states maintained their ownmilitia, separate and apart from the national establishment. There was noprovision for a flow of advice from military to civilian chiefs. If there wereprovisions for violence in the constitution, they were reluctant provisions, andthe agents of violence were held to a strictly instrumental role.After the revolutionary generation, the upper classes were not of a militarystamp; the American elite did not systematically include among its membershigh-ranking military figures; it developed no firm tradition of militaryservice; prestige was not rendered to military servants. The ascendancy ofeconomic over military men in the sphere of ‘honor’ was made quite apparentwhen, during the Civil War, as indeed up to World War I, the hiring of asubstitute for the draft was not looked down upon. Military men, accordingly, ontheir often isolated posts along the old internal frontier, did not enter thehigher circles of the nation.No matter what hardships, and they were often severe, were encountered by thosewho crossed the hemisphere and no matter how military their expeditions andcommunities—and in many ways they were for considerable periods definitely campsof war-still those who headed the nation were not stamped with the military mindand the military outlook.And yet, considering the whole of United States history, we are confronted witha rather curious situation: we are told that we have never been and are not amilitarist nation, that in fact we distrust the military experience, yet we notethat the Revolution led to the ascendancy of General Washington to thePresidency, and that there were bids among certain rejected officers, in theOrder of Cincinnati, to form a military council and install a militarist king.Then too, frontier battling and skirmishes had something to do with thepolitical success of Generals Jackson, Harrison, and Taylor in the Mexican War.And there was also the Civil War, which was long and bloody and split Americansociety across the middle, leaving scars that still remain much in evidence.Civilian authority, on both sides, remained in control through it and after it,but it did lead to the ascendancy of General Grant to the Presidency, whichbecame a convenient front for economic interests. All the Presidents from Grantthrough McKinley, with the exceptions of Cleveland and Arthur, were Civil Warofficers, although only Grant was a professional. And again, with the littleSpanish-American War, we note that the roughest, toughest of them all—perhapsbecause he was not a professional—Theodore Roosevelt—emerged in due course inthe White House. In fact, about half of the thirty-three men who have beenPresident of the United States have had military experience of some sort; sixhave been career officers; nine have been generals.From Shays’ Rebellion to the Korean War there has been no period of any lengthwithout official violence. Since 1776, in fact, the United States has engaged inseven foreign wars, a four-year Civil War, a century of running battles andskirmishes with Indians, and intermittent displays of violence in China, and insubjugating the Caribbean and parts of Central America.*[page_177.html#pg177fn1a] All of these occurrences may have been generallyregarded as nuisances interferring with the more important business at hand,but, at the very least, it must be said that violence as a means and even as avalue is just a little bit ambiguous in American life and culture.The clue to this ambiguity lies in this fact: historically, there has beenplenty of violence, but a great deal of it has been directly performed by ‘thepeople.’ Military force has been decentralized in state militia almost to afeudal point. Military institutions, with few exceptions, have paralleled thescattered means of economic production and the confederate means of politicalpower. Unlike the Cossacks of the Eurasian Steppes, the technical and numericalsuperiority of the American frontiersman who confronted the American Indian madeit unnecessary for a true warrior stratum and a large, disciplinedadministration of violence to emerge. Virtually every man was a rifleman: giventhe technical level of the warfare, the means of violence remaineddecentralized. That simple fact is of the greatest consequence for civiliandominance as well as for the democratic institutions and ethos of earlier timesin America.Historically, democracy in America has been underpinned by the militia system ofarmed citizens at a time when the rifle was the key weapon and one man meant onerifle as well as one vote. Schoolbook historians, accordingly, have not beenprone to think about changes in American military institutions and weaponssystems as causes of political and economic changes. They bring out militaryforces for an Indian skirmish and a distant war, and then they tuck them awayagain. And perhaps the historians are right. But the first armies in Europebased on universal conscription, it ought to be remembered, were revolutionaryarmies. Other countries armed their populations reluctantly; Metternich at theCongress of Vienna urged the abolition of mass conscription; Prussia adopted itonly after her professional army suffered defeats without it; the Tzars, onlyafter the Crimean war; and Austria, only after Bismarck’s recruits defeatedFranz Josef’s troops.5 [ch15_notes.html#ch8en5]The introduction of mass conscript armies in Europe involved the extension ofother ‘rights’ to the conscripts in an effort to strengthen their loyalties. InPrussia, and later in Germany, this was a quite deliberate policy. Theabolishment of serfdom and later the development of social-security plansaccompanied the establishment of mass conscription. Although the correspondenceis not exact, it seems clear that to extend the right to bear arms to thepopulation at large has involved the extension of other rights as well. But inthe United States, the right to bear arms was not extended by an arms-bearingstratum to an unarmed population: the population bore arms from the beginning.Up to World War I, military activities did not involve the discipline ofpermanent military training, nor a monopoly of the tools of violence by thefederal government, nor the professional soldier at the top of a large andpermanent military establishment. Between the Civil War and the Spanish-AmericanWar, the army averaged about 25,000 men, organized on a regimental basis, withregiments and companies largely scattered on posts along the internal frontierand farther west. Through the Spanish-American War, the United States Army wasmilitia-organized, which meant decentralized and with an unprofessional officercorps open to much local influence.The small regular army was supplemented by state militias formed into The USVolunteers, the commanders of these troops being appointed by the governors ofthe states. In this quite unprofessional situation, regular army men could beand often were jumped to generalship in The Volunteers. Politics—which is alsoto say civilian control—reigned supreme. At any given time, there were fewgenerals, and the rank of colonel was often even the West Pointer’s height ofaspiration.3Around the old army general of the late nineteenth century; in his neatlydisheveled blue uniform, there hang wisps of gun smoke from the Civil War. Inthe Civil War he had distinguished himself, and between that war and theSpanish-American fracas he had fought Indians in a most adventurous way. Thedash of the cavalry has rubbed off on him—even if at times making him somethingof a dashing imbecile (Remember Custer and the Little Big Horn!). He livessomething of the hardy life which Theodore Roosevelt esteemed. He often wears amustache, and sometimes a beard, and usually he has a certain unshaven look.Grant had worn a private’s uniform with unshined buttons and ancient boots andthe manner carried on. This old army man has fought up-close: it was not untilWorld War I that an official effort was made ‘to conserve trained personnel’;many generals and dozens of colonels were killed in Civil War battles orafterward in Indian skirmishes. He did not earn the respect of his men bylogistical planning in the Pentagon; he earned it by better shooting, harderriding, faster improvisation when in trouble.The typical general of 19006 [ch15_notes.html#ch8en6] was of an old Americanfamily and of British ancestry. He was born about 1840 in the northeasternsection of the United States and probably grew up either there or in the northcentral section, in a rural area or perhaps a small town. His father was aprofessional man, and the chances are fairly good that his father had politicalconnections—which may or may not have aided him in his career. It took him alittle more than thirty-eight years to become a major-general from the time heentered the army or West Point. When he came into top command, he was aboutsixty years old. If he was religious, he probably attended the Episcopal church.He married, sometimes twice, and his father-in-law, also a professional, mightalso have had some political connections. While in the service, he did notbelong to a political party; but after retirement, he may have dabbled a bit inRepublican politics. It is as unlikely that he wrote anything as that someonewrote very much about him. Officially, he had to retire at sixty-two; and hedied, on the average, at the age of seventy-seven.Only a third of these old army generals had been to West Point and only fourothers had completed college; the old army did not go to school. But we mustremember that many southerners—who had been West Pointers and who hadpredominated in the old federal army—had gone home to fight in the Confederatearmy. Sometimes the army general of 1900 had been commissioned during the CivilWar, sometimes he had come up through the volunteers of the state militia,sometimes he had personally recruited enough men and then he was a colonel.After he was in the regular army, his promotion was largely by seniority, whichwas greatly speeded up during wars, as during his jump from colonelcy during theSpanish-American War. At least half of the old army generals had higherconnections with generals and politicians. General Leonard Wood, for example,who was a medical captain in 1891, became White House physician, and later,under his friends, Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, ended up in 1900as Chief of Staff.Only three of the top three-dozen army men ever went into business—and two ofthese were non-regulars. Local merchants in frontier towns often loved this oldarmy; for it fought Indians and cattle thieves and the army post meant money forthe local economy. And in larger towns, the army was at times authorized tobreak strikes. Small boys also loved it.Between the Civil War and the naval expansion under Theodore Roosevelt, the armywas more in the public eye and its claims for status were cashed in by the lowerclasses. But the navy was more like a gentleman’s club, which occasionally wenton exploring and rescuing expeditions, and the prestige of the navy was amongthe upper classes. This explains, and is in part explained by, the higher levelof origin and more professional training of its officer corps.Apart from the British inheritance of sea power, there was the prestige ofAdmiral Mahan’s theory, linking the greatness of the nation to her sea power,and falling easily upon the ears of Navy Undersecretary Theodore Roosevelt. Thehigher prestige of the navy, coming to a wider public during theSpanish-American War, has been due to the fact that the skills of the navalofficer were more mysterious to laymen than those of the army—few civilianswould dare try to command a ship, but many might a brigade. Since there was not,as in the army, a volunteer system—there was the prestige of skill augmented bythe prestige of a formal, specialized education at Annapolis. There was also thefact of heavy capital investment, represented by the ships in the navalofficer’s command. And finally, there was the absolute authority that The Masterof a ship exercises—especially in view of the sea tradition of contempt for thedeckhand, which, applied to the enlisted sailors, lifted the officers highindeed.The typical admiral of 1900 was born about 1842 of colonial stock and Britishancestry. His father had a professional practice of one kind or another; butmore important, he was of the upper levels of the northeastern seaboard, morelikely than not of an urban center. The future admiral had the academy educationplus two years on a receiving ship. He was only fourteen years old when heentered the navy; and if he was religious, he was definitely Protestant. Someforty-three years after he was accepted at the Academy he became a rear admiral.He was then fifty-eight years old. He had married within his own class level. Heprobably wrote one book, but chances were less that someone wrote a book abouthim; he may, however, have received an honorary degree after the war of 1898;and he retired from the navy at sixty-two years of age. He had held the rank ofrear admiral for only three years; and he died ten years after compulsoryretirement at the average age of seventy-two.Even in 1900, the top of the navy was strictly Annapolis, and gentlemanly too.Recruited from higher class levels than the army, residing more in the East,having had better preparatory training and then the Academy, the admiral hadalso served in the Civil War, after which he slowly rose by avoiding innovation,in personal life or in military duties. Given the meticulous crawl of hiscareer, it was important that he be commissioned early and live long, in orderto reach admiralcy before compulsory retirement at sixty-two. It usually tooksome twenty-five years to become a captain. ‘Officers spent so long a time inthe lower subordinate grades that they never learned to think for themselves.They usually reached command ranks so late that they had lost their youth andambition and had learned only to obey, not to command …’*[page_182.html#pg182fn1a]From one-third to one-half of the duty of the top officers was spent at sea,occurring of course mainly while of lower rank. About half of the topthirty-five naval men had returned at one time or another to Annapolis asinstructors or officials. And some took postgraduate work there. But the key tothe bureaucratic snafu that has often characterized the navy is that as theships and the guns and the logistics became more technically complicated, themen who ran them acquired rank less by technical specialty than by seniority.Accordingly, the skipper became somewhat alienated from his ship and had to takeresponsibility for matters which he did not altogether understand. The bureauheads, who ran the navy, had access to the Secretary, and were often thick withCongressmen. But despite the prominent connections, only one ad-admiral of thisperiod went into business, and only two went into (local) politics.Such, in brief, was the civilian controlled military establishment of the UnitedStates in the later nineteenth century, with its half-professionalized highofficer corps, whose members were not in any important sense of the Americanelite of businessmen and politicians. But this is not the later nineteenthcentury, and most of the historical factors which then shaped the military roleswithin the nation no longer exert the slightest influence on the shape of thehigher echelons of America.4In the middle of the twentieth century, the influence of such peaceful andcivilian values as exist in the United States—and with them the effectivedistrust and subordination of professional military men—must be balanced by theunprecedented situation which the American elite now defines as the situation ofthe nation:I. For the first time, the American elite, as well as effective sections of theunderlying population, begin to realize what it means to live in a militaryneighborhood, what it means to be technically open to catastrophic attack uponthe national domain. Perhaps they also realize how very easy a military time theUnited States as a nation has had, given its geographical isolation, itsenlarging and pacified domestic market, its natural resources needed forindustrialization, and requiring military operations only against atechnologically primitive population. All that is now history: the United Statesis now as much a military neighbor of the Soviet Union—or even more so—asGermany has been of France in previous centuries.II. This is brought home, immediately and dramatically, by the more carefulestimates, now publicly available, of the physical effects of the latest weaponssystem. One saturation attack, it is not unreasonable to suppose, would resultin some 50 million casualties, or nearly one-third of the population.8[ch15_notes.html#ch8en8] That the United States could immediately retaliate withcomparable effects upon the enemy does not, of course, lessen those upon her owndomain and population.Such technical possibilities may be taken in a political and an industrial way,or in their strictly military meaning. The American elite in charge of thatdecision have taken them primarily in their military meaning. The terms in whichthey have defined international reality are predominantly military. As a result,in the higher circles there has been a replacement of diplomacy in anyhistorically recognized sense by calculations of war potential and the militaryseriousness of war threats.Moreover, the new weaponry has been developed as a ‘first line of defense.’Unlike poison gas and bacteria, it has not been considered as a reserve againstits use by the enemy, but as the major offensive weapon. And such grand strategyas has been made public has been officially based upon the assumption that suchweapons will be used during the first days of general war. Indeed, that is nowthe common assumption.III. These definitions of reality and proposed orientations to it have led to afurther feature of America’s international posture: for the first time inAmerican history, men in authority are talking about an ‘emergency’ without aforeseeable end. During modern times, and especially in the United States, menhad come to look upon history as a peaceful continuum interrupted by war. Butnow, the American elite does not have any real image of peace—other than as anuneasy interlude existing precariously by virtue of the balance of mutualfright. The only seriously accepted plan for ‘peace’ is the fully loaded pistol.In short, war or a high state of war preparedness is felt to be the normal andseemingly permanent condition of the United States.IV. The final new feature we would mention of the United States situation, asnow officially defined, is even more significant. For the first time in theirhistory, the American elite find themselves confronting a possible war whichthey admit among themselves and even in public, that none of the combatantswould win. They have no image of what ‘victory’ might mean, and they have noidea of any road to victory. Certainly the generals have no idea. In Korea, forexample, it became quite clear that the stalemate was produced by ‘a paralysisof will’ on the political level. Lieutenant-Colonel Melvin B. Voorhees reportsthe following from an interview with General James Van Fleet: ‘Reporter:“General, what is our goal?” Van Fleet: “I don’t know. The answer must come fromhigher authority.” Reporter: “How may we know, General, when and if we achievevictory?” Van Fleet: “I don’t know, except that somebody higher up will have totell us.”’ ‘That,’ commented a Time editoralist, ‘sums up the last two years ofthe Korean war.’9 [ch15_notes.html#ch8en9] In previous times, leaders of nationsin preparing for war had theories of victory, terms of surrender, and some ofthem at least were confident of the military means of imposing them. By WorldWar II, the United States war aims had become quite vague in any political oreconomic sense, but there were strategic plans for victory by violent means. Butnow there is no literature of victory. Given the means of violence that nowexist, ‘massive retaliation’ is neither a war plan nor an image of victory, butmerely a violent diplomatic—which is to say political—gesture and a recognitionthat all-out war between two nations has now become the means of their mutualdestruction. The position amounts to this: with war all nations may fall, so intheir mutual fright of war, they survive. Peace is a mutual fright, a balance ofarmed fear.I am not concerned, at this point, to debate any of the definitions of realitythat play into the national position or the policies of the United States. Yetgiven these features of the world situation as it is officially defined today,we ought to realize that orthodox military strategy and military expertise ofall types have become irrelevant and misleading in all decisions about worldaffairs that might lead to peace. Clearly all the decisive problems, foremostamong them, the problems of war and peace, now become in a more complete sensethan ever before, political problems. Whether NATO has ten or thirty divisionsis, from a military standpoint, as irrelevant as whether Germany is or is not tobe rearmed. In the light of the now established facts concerning the effect ofall-out bombing, such questions have ceased to be military issues of theslightest importance. They are political questions concerning the ability of theUnited States to line up the nations of Europe.But: given the military definition of reality that prevails among the men withthe power of decision, the rise of the generals and the admirals into the highercircles of the American elite becomes completely understandable and legitimate,completely realistic and desirable. For this new international position of theUnited States, and the new international context itself—both as defined by theelite—have made for a change in their focus of attention. The rise to enlargedcommand and increased status of the warlords of Washington is but the mostobvious sign of this broadening of attention. Decisions of the greatestconsequence have become largely international. If it is too much to say that,for many of the elite, domestic politics have become important mainly as ways ofretaining power at home in order to exert abroad the power of the nationalestablishment, surely it is true that domestic decisions in virtually all areasof life are increasingly justified by, if not made with, close reference to thedangers and opportunities abroad.At the same time, it is not strange that there has been civilian alarm in highplaces over the increased power of the warlords. This alarm would be moreresponsible if it led to effective challenge of the military definition ofreality in favor of political and economic and human images of world affairs.But then, it is easier to be alarmed over warlords, who, of course, are both acause and a result of the definitions of reality that prevail.5As the American means of violence have been enlarged and centralized, they havecome to include an enormously complicated bureaucratic structure, reaching tothe rimlands of Asia and well into the peninsula of Europe with its instrumentsof perception, and into the heart of Eurasia with its strategic air force. Suchchanges in the institutions and reach of the means of violence could not butmake equally significant changes in the men of violence: the United Stateswarlords.The most dramatic symbol of the scale and shape of the new military edifice isthe Pentagon.10 [ch15_notes.html#ch8en10] This concrete and limestone mazecontains the organized brain of the American means of violence. The world’slargest office building, the United States Capitol would fit neatly into any oneof its five segments. Three football fields would reach only the length of oneof its five outer walls. Its seventeen and a half miles of corridor,40,000-phone switchboards, fifteen miles of pneumatic tubing, 2,100 intercoms,connect with one another and with the world, the 31,300 Pentagonians. Prowled by170 security officers, served by 1,000 men and women, it has four full-timeworkers doing nothing but replacing light bulbs, and another four watching themaster panel which synchronizes its 4,000 clocks. Underneath its river entranceare five handball courts and four bowling alleys. It produces ten tons ofnon-classified waste paper a day, which is sold for about $80,000 a year. Itproduces three nation-wide programs a week in its radio-TV studio. Itscommunication system permits four-party conversations between people as farapart as Washington, Tokyo, Berlin, and London.This office building, in this intricate architectural and human maze, is theeveryday milieu of the modern warlords. And no Indian fighters are to be foundamong them.At the head of the military bureaucracy, below the President of the UnitedStates and the Secretary of Defense, whom he appoints, and his assistants, theresits, behind office walls of sheet steel, a military board of directors—theJoint Chiefs of Staff. Immediately below the Joint Chiefs there is a highercircle of generals and admirals which presides over the elaborate and far-flungland, sea, and air forces, as well as the economic and political liaisons heldnecessary to maintain them, and over the publicity machines.Since Pearl Harbor, in a series of laws and directives, a serious attempt hasbeen made to unify the several branches of the service. Easier civilian controlwould result from such unity; but it has not been altogether successful. Thehigh navy especially, has often felt neglected; and each of the services has, onoccasion, gone to Congress over the head of its Secretary—the air force at onetime even winning its point against the opposition of the Secretary. In 1949,the Hoover Commission reported that the military establishment lacked centralauthority and adequate budgetary routines; that it was not a ‘team,’ and thatthe link between scientific research and strategic plans was weak. ‘The lack ofcentral authority in the direction of the national military establishment, therigid statutory structure established under the act, and divided responsibilityhave resulted in a failure to assert clear civilian control over the armedforces.’11 [ch15_notes.html#ch8en11]At the very top, among civilians and military, there have been, since World WarII, sweeping changes of personnel—although the types of men have not decisivelychanged.12 [ch15_notes.html#ch8en12] As Secretary, there has been a politician,a broker, a general, a banker, a corporation executive. Directly confrontingsuch men, sit the four highest military who are ‘all military.’*[page_188.html#pg188fn1a] From the military’s standpoint, perhaps the idealcivilian at the top would be a front to Congress but a willing tool of militarydecision. But this is not always the type that prevails. Recently, for example,the Secretary of the Navy moved an admiral out of a top job for reasons of‘policy differences.’14 [ch15_notes.html#ch8en14] There is undoubtedly tension,the men on either side being, like all men, to some degree prisoners of theirpasts.There are, of course, cliques among the high military, variously related to oneanother and variously related to given civilian policies and cliques. Thesebecome apparent when hidden tensions become open controversies—as at the time ofMacArthur’s dismissal from his Eastern command. At that time there was, inaddition to the MacArthur school of Asia First, already declining in influence,the Marshall-set who gave priority to Europe. There was also theEisenhower-Smith group, which had great influence but did not run the army; andthere was the dominant group who did run it, the Bradley-Collins team.15[ch15_notes.html#ch8en15]** [page_188.html#pg188fn2a] And there is the ratherstandard split between those who feel that the need of the services is for‘truly professional armed forces’ commanded by ‘combat line officers’ and thosewho are happier about the rise of the new ‘specialists’ and staff men.17[ch15_notes.html#ch8en17]As the military increase in power, more tense cliques will probably developamong them, despite ‘unification’—which is, of course, by no means completed.When the military are a minority fighting for survival, they are more likely tohang together than when they are dominant members of the power elite, for thenit is no question of survival but of expansion.In the early twentieth century, the militia system had been centralized; and nowthe weapons systems have developed to the point where rifles are mere toys. Thearming of the citizen is now within a disciplined organization under firmlycentralized control, and the means of suppressing illegitimate violence haveincreased. As a result, those outside the military ruling circles are helplessmilitarily. Yet, at the same time, virtually the entire population is involvedin war, as soldiers or as civilians—which means that they are disciplined in ahierarchy at whose head there sit the warlords of Washington.6The nearest the modern general or admiral comes to a small-arms encounter of anysort is at a duck hunt in the company of corporation executives at the retreatof Continental Motors, Inc. One insurance company, in fact, ‘has been insuringofficers for a decade and a half, went through World War II … and survived …during the Korean War, the mortality rate of officer policyholders serving inthe battle zone was below the average for industry as a whole.’18[ch15_notes.html#ch8en18] As a further fact, Brigadier General S. L. A.Marshall’s studies have revealed that in any given action of World War II,probably no more than 25 per cent of the soldiers who were in a position to firetheir weapons at the enemy actually pulled the trigger.19[ch15_notes.html#ch8en19]The general and the admiral are more professionalized executives than inheritedimages of fighting men would suggest. Two-thirds of the top generals of 195020[ch15_notes.html#ch8en20] graduated from The Point (all of the admirals, both in1900 and 1950, graduated from the Naval Academy); most saw service in World WarI, and most of them lived through the general anti-militarist peace of the’twenties and ’thirties, begging for appropriations, denying themerchants-of-death charges. Above them all towered the spit-and-polish image ofPershing.During the interwar years nothing really happened in their professional lives.It was in some ways as if a doctor were passing his life without seeing anypatients, for the military were not called upon really to exercise theirprofessional skill. But they had the services. Perhaps that is the clue to theirdevelopment in such periods: in them there is intensified the desire, too deeplyrooted to examine, to conform to type, to be indistinguishable, not to revealloss of composure to inferiors, and above all, not to presume the right to upsetthe arrangements of the chain of command. It was important that those above themcould not find anything against them; and, at home and abroad, the life of theprofessional military went on in their own little colonies, quite insulated fromthe economic and political life of the nation. In the civilian distrust thatprevailed, the military were supposed to ‘stay out of politics,’ and most ofthem seemed glad to do so.The military life of the interwar officer revolved around his rank. Through therank of colonel, promotion was by seniority, and standing before the officer was‘the hump’—a concentration of four or five thousand officers, most of themcommissioned during World War I. As a result of this hump, it took a man‘twenty-two years to climb from the junior captain to the senior captain.’ Hecould ‘scarcely hope to top the grade of captain before reaching his fifties.’21[ch15_notes.html#ch8en21]The social life of the interwar officer also revolved around his rank. Towardthe world of civilians, as well as among their unappreciated selves, there wasintense consciousness of rank. General George C. Marshall’s wife, rememberingthis period, recalls an officer’s wife remarking, ‘At a tea such as this one youalways ask the highest-ranking officer’s wife to pour coffee, not tea [because]coffee outranks tea.’ She also remembers the life of the colonel in the slumpwhen—as she elsewhere notes—the army was so pressed for funds that targetpractice was curtailed: ‘Our quarters at Fort Moultrie were not a home, but ahotel. The house had been built by the Coast Artillery in its balmy days, butnow the place was in bad repair. It had 42 French doors leading out on the lowerand top verandas, which extended around three sides of the house.’ And whenMarshall became a general: ‘In front of the cottage stood a beautiful newPackard car—to replace our little Ford. So he had one thrill out of hisgeneralcy, for a Packard in those times of depression was indeed a marvelousthrill. I was quite overcome with joy.’22 [ch15_notes.html#ch8en22]Another colonel’s lady remembers the rank order among wives: ‘When someonesuggested that a committee be selected to buy the books, the doctor’s wife, whoknew my weakness, murmured my name, but the colonel’s wife appointed the threehighest ranking ladies present.’ And she too remembers the life abroad amonghigher military personnel: ‘In China our domestic staff had consisted of five …The pay freeze [during the slump] which cut out these automatic increases hurtmore junior than senior officers. No general was affected by it, and only oneadmiral. Seventy-five per cent of the loss, in the army, was stood bylieutenants, captains, warrant officers and nurses.’23 [ch15_notes.html#ch8en23]It was in these interwar days that second-lieutenant Eisenhower met Mamie Doud,whose father was prosperous enough to retire to leisure in Denver at the age ofthirty-six and, with his family, winter in San Antonio.It is reported, as of 1953, that ‘a typical career officer at age forty-five orfifty may accumulate as much as $50,000 of insurance over the years.’25[ch15_notes.html#ch8en25] And of the interwar naval officer’s life, it has beensaid: ‘The summer cruises were exciting, and the gold stripes and extraprivileges of upper-class life made you begin to feel like somebody after all.And you … learned good manners, and visited your roommate’s home in Philadelphiaone Christmas holiday and got your first taste of the social pampering in storefor personable young navy men … you listened to so many lectures admonishing younot to consider yourself superior to a civilian that you found yourself feelingthat you really were a cut above, but that it would be improper to show that youthought so.’26 [ch15_notes.html#ch8en26]Yet it has not generally been true in the United States that, as Veblen wouldhave it, since ‘war is honorable, warlike prowess is honorific.’27[ch15_notes.html#ch8en27] Nor has it been true that military officers havegenerally derived from, or become, members of Veblen’s leisure class.*[page_191.html#pg191fn1a] It is more true of the navy than of the army—the airforce is too new for such developments. On the whole, the high officers of thearmy and navy have been men of the upper-middle rather than truly higher ordefinitely lower classes. Only a very small percentage of them are ofworking-class origin. They have been the sons of professional men, ofbusinessmen, of farmers, of public officials, and of military men. They areoverwhelmingly Protestant, mainly Episcopalians or Presbyterians. Few haveserved in the ranks.29 [ch15_notes.html#ch8en29]And for almost all of them of today, World War II is the pivotal event. It isthe pivot of the modern military career and of the political and military andsocial climate in which that career is being enacted. Younger men among the toptoday saw combat duty in leading regiments or divisions, and older men, rapidlyadvanced in the great expansion, rose to the top headquarters at home andabroad.7Social origins and early backgrounds are less important to the character of theprofessional military man than to any other high social type. The training ofthe future admiral or general begins early and is thus deeply set, and themilitary world which he enters is so all-encompassing that his way of life isfirmly centered within it. To the extent that these conditions exist, whether heis the son of a carpenter or a millionaire is that much less important.The point should not, of course, be pushed too far. Although the military is themost bureaucratic of all types within the American elite, it is not absolutelybureaucratic, and, as in all bureaucracies, on its higher levels it becomes lessso than on its lower and middle. Nevertheless, when we examine the militarycareer, one fact appears to be so central that we need not go far beyond it.That fact is that for most of their careers, the admirals and the generals havefollowed a quite uniform and pre-arranged pattern. Once we know the ground rulesand the pivotal junctures of this standardized career, we already know as muchas we can find out from the detailed statistics of a multitude of careers.The military world selects and forms those who become a professional part of it.The harsh initiation at The Point or The Academy—and on lower levels of themilitary service, in basic training—reveals the attempt to break up earlycivilian values and sensibilities in order the more easily to implant acharacter structure as totally new as possible.It is this attempt to break up the earlier acquired sensibilities that lies backof the ‘breaking’ of the recruit and the assignment to him of very low status inthe military world. He must be made to lose much of his old identity in orderthat he can then become aware of his very self in the terms of his militaryrole. He must be isolated from his old civilian life in order that he will comeeagerly to place the highest value on successful conformity with militaryreality, on deep acceptance of the military outlook, and on proud realization ofsuccess within its hierarchy and in its terms. His very self-esteem becomesquite thoroughly dependent upon the appraisals he receives from his peers andhis superiors in the chain of command. His military role, and the world of whichit is a part, is presented to him as one of the higher circles of the nation.There is a strong emphasis upon the whole range of social etiquette, and, invarious formal and informal ways, he is encouraged to date girls of higherrather than of lower status. He is made to feel that he is entering upon animportant sector of the higher circles of the nation, and, accordingly, hisconception of himself as a self-confident man becomes based upon his conceptionof himself as a loyal member of an ascendant organization. The only‘educational’ routine in America that compares with the military is that of themetropolitan 400’s private schools, and they do not altogether measure up to themilitary way.30 [ch15_notes.html#ch8en30]West Point and Annapolis are the beginning points of the warlords, and, althoughmany other sources of recruitment and ways of training have had to be used inthe emergencies of expansion, they are still the training grounds of the eliteof the armed forces.31 [ch15_notes.html#ch8en31] Most of the top generals andall of the admirals of today are of West Point or of The Academy, and theydefinitely feel it. In fact, if no such caste feeling existed among them, thesecharacter-selecting and character-forming institutions would have to be calledfailures.The caste feeling of the military is an essential feature of the trulyprofessional officer corps which, since the Spanish-American War, has replacedthe old decentralized, and somewhat locally political, militia system. ‘Theobjective is the fleet,’ naval Captain L. M. Nulton has written, ‘the doctrineis responsibility, and the problem is the formation of military character.’32[ch15_notes.html#ch8en32] Of the period when most present-day admirals were atAnnapolis, it was asserted by Commander Earle: ‘The discipline of the NavalAcademy well illustrates the principle that in every community discipline meanssimply organized living. It is the condition of living right because withoutright living, civilization cannot exist. Persons who will not live right must becompelled to do so, and upon such misguided individuals there must be placedrestraints. To these alone is discipline ever harsh or a form of punishment.Surely this is just as it should be. The world would be better if suchindividuals were made to feel the tyranical, unyielding, and hard-nailed fist inorder to drive them from an organization to which they have not right tobelong.’* [page_194.html#pg194fn1a]The military world bears decisively upon its inhabitants because it selects itsrecruits carefully and breaks up their previously acquired values; it isolatesthem from civilian society and it standardises their career and deportmentthroughout their lives. Within this career, a rotation of assignment makes forsimilarity of skills and sensibilities. And, within the military world, a higherposition is not merely a job or even the climax of a career; it is clearly atotal way of life which is developed under an all-encompassing system ofdiscipline. Absorbed by the bureaucratic hierarchies in which he lives, and fromwhich he derives his very character and image of self, the military man is oftensubmerged in it, or as a possible civilian, even sunk by it. As a socialcreature, he has until quite recently been generally isolated from other areasof American life; and as an intellectual product of a closed educational system,with his experience itself controlled by a code and a sequence of jobs, he hasbeen shaped into a highly uniform type.More than any other creatures of the higher circles, modern warlords, on orabove the two-star rank, resemble one another, internally and externally.Externally, as John P. Marquand has observed,34 [ch15_notes.html#ch8en34] theiruniforms often seem to include their facial mask, and certainly its typicalexpressions. There is the resolute mouth and usually the steady eye, and alwaysthe tendency to expressionlessness; there is the erect posture, the squareshoulders, and the regulated cadence of the walk. They do not amble; theystride. Internally, to the extent that the whole system of life-training hasbeen successful, they are also reliably similar in reaction and in outlook. Theyhave, it is said, ‘the military mind,’ which is no idle phrase: it points to theproduct of a specialized bureaucratic training; it points to the results of asystem of formal selection and common experiences and friendships andactivities—all enclosed within similar routines. It also points to the fact ofdiscipline—which means instant and stereotyped obedience within the chain ofcommand. The military mind also indicates the sharing of a common outlook, thebasis of which is the metaphysical definition of reality as essentially militaryreality. Even within the military realm, this mind distrusts ‘theorists,’ ifonly because they tend to be different: bureaucratic thinking is orderly andconcrete thinking.The fact that they have succeeded in climbing the military hierarchy, which theyhonor more than any other, lends self-assurance to the successful warlords. Theprotections that surround their top positions make them even more assured andconfident. If they should lose confidence in themselves what else would there befor them to lose? Within a limited area of life, they are often quite competent,but to them, in their disciplined loyalty, this area is often the only area oflife that is truly worthwhile. They are inside an apparatus of prerogative andgraded privilege in which they have been economically secure and unworried.Although not usually rich, they have never faced the perils of earning a livingin the same way that lower and middle-class persons have. The orderly ranks oftheir chain of command, as we have seen, are carried over into their sociallife: such striving for status as they have known has been within an unambiguousand well-organized hierarchy of status, in which each knows his place andremains within it.In this military world, debate is no more at a premium than persuasion: oneobeys and one commands, and matters, even unimportant matters, are not to bedecided by voting. Life in the military world accordingly influences themilitary mind’s outlook on other institutions as well as on its own. The warlordoften sees economic institutions as means for military production and the hugecorporation as a sort of ill-run military establishment. In his world, wages arefixed, unions impossible to conceive. He sees political institutions as oftencorrupt and usually inefficient obstacles, full of undisciplined andcantankerous creatures. And is he very unhappy to hear of civilians andpoliticians making fools of themselves?It is men with minds and outlooks formed by such conditions who in postwarAmerica have come to occupy positions of great decision. It cannot be said—as weshall presently make clear—that they have necessarily sought these newpositions; much of their increased stature has come to them by virtue of adefault on the part of civilian political men. But perhaps it can be said, as C.S. Forester has remarked in a similar connection, that men without livelyimagination are needed to execute policies without imagination devised by anelite without imagination.35 [ch15_notes.html#ch8en35] But it must also be saidthat to Tolstoy’s conception of the general at war—as confidence builderpretending by his manner that he knows what the confusion of battle is allabout—we must add the image of the general as the administrator of the men andmachines which now make up the greatly enlarged means of violence.In contrast with the inter-war careers and activities, the warlord of post-WorldWar II who is slated for the top will have spent a crucial tour of duty in thePentagon, where on the middle and lower ranks each man has a superior lookingover his shoulder, and where, at the top, civilians and military look over oneanother’s shoulders. The army’s lieutenant colonel or the navy’s commander inhis thirties will probably make his jump, if at all, in or quite near thePentagon. Here, as a cog in an intricate machine, he may come into the view ofthose who count, here he may be picked up for staff position and later be giventhe forward-looking command. So, in an earlier day, was Pershing impressed byGeorge C. Marshall; so Nimitz was impressed by Forrest Sherman; Hap Arnold wasimpressed by Lauris Norstad; Eisenhower by Gruenther; Gruenther by Schuyler.What will the future warlord do in the Pentagon, where there seem more admiralsthan ensigns, more generals than second lieutenants? He will not command men, oreven for quite a while a secretary. He will read reports and brief them asinter-office memos; he will route papers with colored tags—red for urgent, greenfor rush-rush, yellow for expedite. He will serve on one of the 232 committees.He will prepare information and opinion for those who make decisions, carefullyguarding his superior’s Yes. He will try to become known as a ‘comer,’ and, evenas in the corporate world, somebody’s bright young man. And, as in allbureaucratic mazes, he will try to live by the book (‘Standard OperatingProcedure’) but know just how far to stretch its letter in order to be anexpediter, an operator, who on lower levels can procure another secretary forhis office-unit, and on higher levels, another air wing. It is the activities ofthe warlords on still higher levels that we must now examine."},{"pageContent":"9THE MILITARY ASCENDANCYSINCE Pearl Harbor those who command the enlarged means of American violencehave come to possess considerable autonomy, as well as great influence, amongtheir political and economic colleagues. Some professional soldiers have steppedout of their military roles into other high realms of American life. Others,while remaining soldiers, have influenced by advice, information, and judgmentthe decisions of men powerful in economic and political matters, as well as ineducational and scientific endeavors. In and out of uniform, generals andadmirals have attempted to sway the opinions of the underlying population,lending the weight of their authority, openly as well as behind closed doors, tocontroversial policies.In many of these controversies, the warlords have gotten their way; in others,they have blocked actions and decisions which they did not favor. In somedecisions, they have shared heavily; in others they have joined issue and lost.But they are now more powerful than they have ever been in the history of theAmerican elite; they have now more means of exercising power in many areas ofAmerican life which were previously civilian domains; they now have moreconnections; and they are now operating in a nation whose elite and whoseunderlying population have accepted what can only be called a militarydefinition of reality. Historically, the warlords have been only uneasy, poorrelations within the American elite; now they are first cousins; soon they maybecome elder brothers.1Although the generals and admirals have increasingly become involved inpolitical and economic decisions, they have not shed the effects of the militarytraining which has moulded their characters and outlook. Yet on the higherlevels of their new careers the terms of their success have changed. Examiningthem closely today, one comes to see that some are not so different fromcorporation executives as one had first supposed, and that others seem more likepoliticians of a curious sort than like traditional images of the military.It has been said that a military man, acting as Secretary of Defense forexample, might be more civilian in effect than a civilian who, knowing little ofmilitary affairs and personnel, is easily hoodwinked by the generals andadmirals who surround him. It might also be felt that the military man inpolitics does not have a strong-willed, new and decisive line of policy, andeven that, in a civilian political world, the general becomes aimless and, inhis lack of know-how and purpose, even weak.1 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en1]On the other hand, we must not forget the self-confidence that is instilled bythe military training and career: those who are successful in military careersvery often gain thereby a confidence which they readily carry over into economicand political realms. Like other men, they are of course open to the advice andmoral support of old friends who, in the historical isolation of the militarycareer, are predominantly military. Whatever the case may be with individuals,as a coherent group of men the military is probably the most competent nowconcerned with national policy; no other group has had the training inco-ordinated economic, political, and military affairs; no other group has hadthe continuous experience in the making of decisions; no other group so readily‘internalizes’ the skills of other groups nor so readily engages their skills onits own behalf; no other group has such steady access to world-wide information.Moreover, the military definitions of political and economic reality that nowgenerally prevail among the most civilian of politicians cannot be said toweaken the confidence of the warlords, their will to make policy, or theircapacity to do so within the higher circles.The ‘politicalization’ of the high military that has been going on over the lastfifteen years is a rather intricate process: As members of a professionalofficer corps, some military men develop a vested interest—personal,institutional, ideological—in the enlargement of all things military. Asbureaucrats, some are zealous to enlarge their own particular domains. As men ofpower, some develop quite arrogant, and others quite shrewd, drives toinfluence, enjoying as a high value the exercise of power. But by no means areall military men prompted by such motives.* [page_200.html#pg200fn1a] As a typeof man, the professional military are not inherently out for political power,or, at least, one need not rest the case upon any such imputation of motive. Foreven if they are not desirous of political power, power essentially political innature may be and has been thrust upon them by civilian default; they have beenmuch used—willingly or not—by civilians for political purposes.From the standpoint of the party politician, a well-trained general or admiralis an excellent legitimator of policies, for his careful use often makes itpossible to lift the policy ‘above politics,’ which is to say above politicaldebate and into the realm of administration, where, as statesman Dulles said insupport of General Eisenhower for President, there are needed men with thecapacity for ‘making grave decisions.’3 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en3]From the standpoint of the political administrator, military men are oftenbelieved useful because they constitute a pool of men trained in executiveskills but not openly identified with any private interests. The absence of agenuine Civil Service’** [page_200.html#pg200fn2a] which selects and trains andencourages career men, makes it all the more tempting to draw upon the military.Politicians thus default upon their proper job of debating policy, hiding behinda supposed military expertise; and political administrators default upon theirproper job of creating a real civilian career service. Out of both thesecivilian defaults, the professional military gain ascendancy. It is for suchreasons, more than any other, that the military elite—whose members arepresumably neither politically appointed nor politically responsible—have beendrawn into the higher political decisions.Once they enter the political arena—willingly, reluctantly, or evenunknowingly—they are of course criticized; they become politically controversialand, like any other political actors, they are open to attack. Even when theyare not explicitly in politics, the military are attacked politically. In theAmerican context of civilian distrust, the military has always been a handytarget of political abuse. But the matter now goes farther than that. In 1953,Senator McCarthy, as Hanson Baldwin put it, ‘tried to assume command of the Armyand stormed at officers with long and faithful service because they … obeyed theorders of their legitimate superiors.’4 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en4] Thus heentered, without benefit of induction, the chain of command. The warlord seeshow such attacks have virtually destroyed the public respect and the internalmorale of the State Department, and he is afraid that his organization, too,will be hollowed out. Moreover, since he holds power to affect economic affairs,having a majority cut of the budget, he is open to attack by new civilianadministrative heads who lean on him but also kick him around, as well as bypolitical demagogues who are out to exploit his ‘errors’ or invent ‘errors’ forhim to commit.As politics get into the army, the army gets into politics. The military hasbeen and is being made political, on the one hand, by civilian default, and onthe other, by civilian criticism of military decisions.Not always being aware of just what is happening, believing in their mask of‘military expert,’ and being used to command, the military often react tocriticism in a rather rigid way. In the army book, there is no StandardOperating Procedure for fighting a Senator. There seem only two ways out: Oneway, especially if there is a war on, is a field command and obeying ordersrigidly without political question. In other words, go soldierly and withdraw,be aloof and stiff in your dignity. The other way is to go all out politically,by the classic ways of forming alliances with political figures, and, giventheir executive position, maybe some new ways too. For, so long as they remainofficers, they cannot very well go explicitly and openly political in the partysense—although some have done so. But, in the main, they will necessarily workcarefully and behind the scenes—they will, in short, be open to membership, withother military men, with corporation executives, and with members of thepolitical directorate and of the Congress, to form or to join pro-militarycliques on the higher levels.One must also remember that, by virtue of their training and experience, theprofessional military believe firmly in the military definition of worldreality, and that, accordingly, given the new and enormous means of violence andthe nervous default of civilian diplomacy, they are genuinely frightened fortheir country. Those with the most conviction and, in their terms, ability, willbe frustrated by retreat into the role of the strictly apolitical technician ofviolence. Besides, many are too high up and already too deeply involved forsoldierly withdrawal.It is in terms of this situation that we must understand the political ways ofthe warlords, and the higher influence military men have now come to exertwithin the power elite of America. Military men are supposed to be the mereinstruments of political men, but the problems they confront increasinglyrequire political decisions. To treat such political decisions as ‘militarynecessities’ is of course to surrender civilian responsibility, if not decision,to the military elite. But if the military metaphysics, to which the civilianelite now clings, are accepted, then by definition warfare is the only reality,that is to say, the necessity, of our time.2As the United States has become a great world power, the military establishmenthas expanded, and members of its higher echelons have moved directly intodiplomatic and political circles. General Mark Clark, for example, who hasprobably had more political experience while on active duty than any otherAmerican warlord, ‘believes in what he calls the “buddy system”—a political manand a military man working together,’ of which he has said: ‘In the past, manyAmerican generals were inclined to say of politics: “To hell with it, let’s talkpolitics later.” But you can’t do it this way any more.’5[ch15_notes.html#ch9en5]In 1942, General Clark dealt with Darlan and Giraud in North Africa; then hecommanded the Eighth Army in Italy; then he was occupation commander forAustria; and, in 1952, he became US Commander in newly sovereign Japan, as wellas head of the US Far East Command and UN Commander in Korea. General George C.Marshall, after being the President’s personal representative to China, becameSecretary of State (1947–49), then Secretary of Defense (1950–51). Vice AdmiralAlan G. Kirk was Ambassador to Belgium in the late ’forties and then to Russia.In 1947, the Assistant Secretary of State for occupied areas was Major GeneralJohn H. Hildring who dealt ‘directly with the military commanders who controlthe execution of policy in Germany, Austria, Japan and Korea’;6[ch15_notes.html#ch9en6] Brigadier General Frank T. Hines was Ambassador toPanama; and General Walter Bedell Smith was Ambassador to Russia. General Smithlater became the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (1950–53), then UnderSecretary of State (1953–54). As occupation commander in Germany, there wasGeneral Lucius D. Clay; of Japan, General MacArthur. And no diplomat, but aformer Army Chief of Staff, General J. Lawton Collins, went to troubledIndo-China in 1954 ‘to restore some order’ in an area which he said ‘hadessential political and economic importance for Southeast Asia and the freeworld.’7 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en7]Moreover, while still in uniform as well as out of it, high-ranking officershave engaged in policy debate. General Omar Bradley, one of the most articulatedeniers of undue military influence in civilian decisions, has appeared beforeCongressional committees, as well as before broader publics, in support ofpolicies involving economic and political as well as strictly military issues.General Marshall, for example, has submitted arguments against the Wagner-Taftresolution which favored increased immigration to Palestine and its furtherdevelopment as a Jewish homeland.8 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en8] With GeneralsBradley, Vandenberg, and Collins, as well as Admiral Sherman, General Marshallhas also defended before Congressional committees the Truman administrationagainst Republican attack upon its Far-Eastern policy, and the ousting ofGeneral MacArthur from his Far-Eastern command.General Bradley has made numerous speeches which in their context were readilyinterpreted, by Senator Taft and Hanson Baldwin among others, as relevant to thepolitical issues of the 1952 Presidential elections. ‘This speech,’ wrote HansonBaldwin, ‘helped put General Bradley and the Joint Chiefs of Staff into thepolitical hustings where they have no business to be.’9 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en9]Senator Taft, who accused the Joint Chiefs of Staff of being under the controlof the political administration and of echoing their policies rather thanrendering merely expert advice, was himself supported by General AlbertWedemeyer, as well as by General MacArthur. Another general, Bonner Fellers, wason the Republican National Committee.In the 1952 election, in direct violation of U.S. Army Regulation 600–10,General MacArthur, in public speeches, attacked the policies of the duly electedadministration, delivered the keynote address at the Republican convention, andmade it clear that he was open to the Presidential nomination. But anothergeneral, Eisenhower, also not retired, was successfully supported for this role.Both of these generals, as well as what might be considered their politicalpolicies, were supported by other military men. There is no doubt about it:there are now Republican and Democratic generals. There are also, as we now knowwell, officers who are for or against individual Senators—such as McCarthy—andwho in their military positions lean one way or the other to reveal it or tohide it.In 1954, a notable array of the high military—headed by retired Lt. GeneralGeorge E. Stratemeyer with retired Rear Admiral John G. Crommelin as Chief ofStaff—offered their names in an effort to rally ten million signatures for aMcCarthy petition.10 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en10] This occurred in the context ofthe military ascendancy at a time when the words of Old Soldier MacArthur hadnot faded: ‘We of the military shall always do what we are told to do. But ifthis nation is to survive, we must trust the soldier once our statesmen fail topreserve the peace.’ (1953)—‘I find in existence a new and heretofore unknownand dangerous concept that the members of our armed forces owe primaryallegiance and loyalty to those who temporarily exercise the authority of theExecutive Branch of government rather than to the country and its Constitutionwhich they are sworn to defend. No proposition could be more dangerous.’(1951)11 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en11]But more important perhaps than the straightforward assumption of politicalroles, the private advice, or the public speeches, is a more complex type ofmilitary influence: high military men have become accepted by other members ofthe political and economic elite, as well as by broad sectors of the public, asauthorities on issues that go well beyond what has historically been consideredthe proper domain of the military.Since the early ’forties, the traditional Congressional hostility toward themilitary has been transformed into something of a ‘friendly and trusting’subservience. No witness—except of course J. Edgar Hoover—is treated with moredeference by Senators than the high military. ‘Both in what it did and in whatit refused to do,’ we read in an official government account, ‘the wartimeCongress co-operated consistently and almost unquestioningly with thesuggestions and the requests from the Chief of Staff.’12[ch15_notes.html#ch9en12] And in the coalition strategy, while the President andthe Prime Minister ‘decided,’ theirs were choices approved by the military andmade from among alternatives organized and presented by the military.According to the Constitution, the Congress is supposed to be in charge of thesupport and governing of the armed might of the nation. During times of peace,prior to World War II, professional politicians in the Congress did argue thedetails of military life with the military, and made decisions for them,debating strategy and even determining tactics. During World War II, Congressmen‘voted’ for such items as the Manhattan Project without having the slightestidea of its presence in the military budget, and when—by rumor—Senator Trumansuspected that something big was going on, a word from the Secretary of War wasenough to make him drop all inquiry. In the postwar period, the simple fact isthat the Congress has had no opportunity to get real information on militarymatters, much less the skill and time to evaluate it. Behind their ‘security’and their ‘authority’ as experts, the political role of the high military indecisions of basic political and economic relevance has become greatly enlarged.And again, it has been enlarged as much or more because of civilian politicaldefault—perhaps necessarily, given the organization and personnel ofCongress—than by any military usurpation.13 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en13]3No area of decision has been more influenced by the warlords and by theirmilitary metaphysics than that of foreign policy and international relations. Inthese zones, the military ascendancy has coincided with other forces that havebeen making for the downfall of civilian diplomacy as an art, and of thecivilian diplomatic service as an organized group of competent people. Themilitary ascendancy and the downfall of diplomacy have occurred precisely when,for the first time in United States history, international issues are truly atthe center of the most important national decisions and increasingly relevant tovirtually all decisions of consequence. With the elite’s acceptance of militarydefinitions of world reality, the professional diplomat, as we have known him oras we might imagine him, has simply lost any effective voice in the highercircles.Once war was considered the business of soldiers, international relations theconcern of diplomats. But now that war has become seemingly total and seeminglypermanent, the free sport of kings has become the forced and internecinebusiness of people, and diplomatic codes of honor between nations havecollapsed. Peace is no longer serious; only war is serious. Every man and everynation is either friend or foe, and the idea of enmity becomes mechanical,massive, and without genuine passion. When virtually all negotiation aimed atpeaceful agreement is likely to be seen as ‘appeasement,’ if not treason, theactive role of the diplomat becomes meaningless; for diplomacy becomes merely aprelude to war or an interlude between wars, and in such a context the diplomatis replaced by the warlord.Three sets of facts about American diplomacy and American diplomats are relevantto the understanding of what has been happening: the relative weakness of theprofessional diplomatic service; its further weakening by ‘investigation’ and‘security’ measures; and the ascendancy among those in charge of it of themilitary metaphysics.I. Only in those settings in which subtle nuances of social life and politicalintention blend, can ‘diplomacy’—which is at once a political function and asocial art—be performed. Such an art has seemed to require those social gracesusually acquired by persons of upper-class education and style of life. And thecareer diplomat has, in fact, been representative of the wealthier classes.*[page_206.html#pg206fn1a]But up to 1930, a career in the foreign service had not led to the ambassadorialranks.** [page_207.html#pg207fn1a] Of the eighty-six men who served as Americanambassadors between 1893 and 1930, only about one-fourth of them had heldpositions in the foreign service prior to their appointment as ambassadors. ‘TheBritish Ambassador,’ D. A. Hartman has pointed out, ‘represents the final stageof a definite career in the Foreign Service, while the American ambassadorshipis scarcely more than a belated episode in the life of a businessman,politician, or lawyer.’16 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en16]During the long Democratic tenure something like a career service, based uponupper-class recruitment, had been developed. Of the thirty-two ambassadors andtop ministers of 1942, almost half were graduates of private preparatory schoolsfrequented by the children of the metropolitan 400; and of the top one hundredand eighteen officers in the Foreign Service, fifty-one were Harvard, Princetonor Yale.17 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en17]When the Republicans assumed office in 1953, there were 1,305 Foreign Serviceofficers (out of a total State Department of 19,405) serving the seventy-twodiplomatic missions and one hundred ninety-eight consular offices of the UnitedStates.18 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en18] Forty of the seventy-two chiefs of UnitedStates missions abroad had been career diplomats ‘whose appointments toparticular posts may have been by the President but whose tenure in the foreignservice is unaffected by the change in administration.’19[ch15_notes.html#ch9en19] There were two alternatives open to the careermen—they could retire, or they could resign from their posts and becomeavailable for other assignments under the new administration.By this time it would seem that a foreign-service career leading up to anambassadorship had become more firmly entrenched, since nineteen of the toptwenty-five ambassadors appointed by President Eisenhower were career men. Butit might also be said that by 1953 it was no longer an ‘honor’ to a prominentbusinessman, lawyer, or politician to be appointed as the ambassador to thegenerally small countries in which almost all of these career men served.20[ch15_notes.html#ch9en20] However, later in his administration, PresidentEisenhower began to appoint unsuccessful politicians and political helpmates tothe smaller countries hitherto reserved for career men. Thus in Madrid, John D.Lodge—defeated for governor of Connecticut—replaced the veteran diplomat JamesC. Dunn. In Libya, John L. Tappin—ski expert and chief of a division of‘Citizens for Eisenhower’—replaced career-man Henry S. Villard.21[ch15_notes.html#ch9en21] In the more coveted diplomatic posts, representingAmerica were millionaire bankers; members, relatives, and advisers of the veryrich; high corporate lawyers; the husbands of heiresses.II. Even before the change of administration, the morale and competence of thecareer service had been severely weakened by investigation and dismissal ofpersonnel. Then Senator McCarthy’s associate, Scott McLeod, moved from the FBIto the head of both security and personnel in the Department of State. Mr.McLeod, who ‘believes that “security” is a basic criterion of diplomacy,’ hasremarked that after checking all other qualifications, he asks himself: ‘Howwould I like him to be behind a tree with me in a gunfight? You get pretty highstandards if you think along such lines. And that’s the way I like to think inthese investigations.’22 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en22] There were many men who‘wouldn’t fit behind a tree’ with policeman McLeod, and among many ForeignService officers who still held their positions ‘the impression grew that itwasn’t safe to report the truth to Washington about any foreign situation whenthe truth didn’t jibe with the preconceived notions of the people inWashington.’* [page_209.html#pg209fn1a]23 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en23]Following a long list of men already dismissed for reasons of ‘loyalty,’ in thefall of 1954, a career diplomat of twenty-three years service, John PatonDavies, was dismissed not on the grounds of loyalty, but because of ‘lack ofjudgment, discretion and reliability’; his opinions on China policy ten yearspreviously not jibing with the current administration policy.25[ch15_notes.html#ch9en25] The comments on this case by career men expressedtheir state of mind. A recent member of the Policy Planning Staff of the StateDepartment wrote: ‘One hopes that the American public will see at last that theword “security” has become a euphemism. It covers the primitive political driveof the last five years to eliminate intellectual and moral distinction from theGovernment service, and to staff the Government instead with political goodfellows who cannot be suspected of superiority. Under the reorganized ForeignService, for example, educational standards for admission are being avowedlylowered. It is as if the mediocrity of the mindless has become the ideal.’26[ch15_notes.html#ch9en26] George Kennan, a veteran diplomat and a distinguishedstudent of foreign affairs, has advised a class of students at Princeton not tochoose the foreign service as a career. In other words: ‘the morale of the StateDepartment is so broken that its finest men flee from it, and advise others toflee.’27 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en27]III. For years of course the military attaches have been at their foreign posts,where they are supposedly the Ambassador’s aides as well as a link in anintelligence service; but ‘many of them, in the post-war years, have viewed theForeign Service and State Department with ill-disguised contempt and madethemselves virtually independent of the Ambassadors under whom they shouldwork.’* [page_210.html#pg210fn1a]The problem, however, goes well beyond such relatively low-order tension. Themilitary, as we have seen, have become ambassadors as well as special envoys. Inmany of the major international decisions, the professional diplomats havesimply been by-passed, and matters decided by cliques of the high military andpolitical personnel. In the defense agreements signed by the United States andSpain in September of 1953, as in the disposition in 1945 and 1946 of thewestern Pacific islands captured from the Japanese, the military has set policyof diplomatic relevance without or against the advice of the diplomats.29[ch15_notes.html#ch9en29] The Japanese peace treaty was not arranged bydiplomats but by generals; a peace treaty with Germany has not been made: therehave only been alliances and agreements between armies. At Panmunjom, the end ofthe Korean war was ‘negotiated’ not by a diplomat but by a General in opencollar and without necktie. ‘The American services,’ writes the LondonEconomist, ‘have successfully implanted the idea that there are such things aspurely military factors and that questions which involve them cannot beadequately assessed by a civilian. British theory and experience denies boththese propositions ….’30 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en30]So Admiral Radford, who has told a Congressional Committee that Red China had tobe destroyed even if it required a fifty-year war, argued, as chairman of theJoint Chiefs of Staff, for the use of 500 planes to drop tactical A-bombs onVietminh troops before the fall of Dienbienphu. If China openly came into thepicture, we are unofficially told, Peking was to be given atomic treatment.31[ch15_notes.html#ch9en31] This political situation was defined by him asmilitary, and as such argued for with a voice as loud as those of his civilianbosses, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State. In August 1954,General Mark Clark publicly stated that Russia should be ejected from the UnitedNations, and diplomatic relations with her broken off. General Eisenhower, thenPresident, disagreed with his intimate friend, but the President’s word did notstop General James A. Van Fleet from publicly subscribing to General Clark’sviews.32 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en32] Not that it was too important an issue, forthe UN has regularly been by-passed in important decisions and conclaves. The UNdid not organize the Geneva conference; the UN did not consider the UnitedStates action in Guatemala.33 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en33] The by-passing of the UNin the most important East-West conflicts and its general political weakening isone aspect of the downfall of diplomacy in the postwar period. The other aspectis the military ascendancy, as personnel and as metaphysics.In America, diplomacy has never been successfully cultivated as a learned art bytrained and capable professionals, and those who have taken it up have not beenable to look forward to obtaining the top diplomatic posts available, for thesehave been largely bestowed according to the dictates of politics and business.Such professional diplomatic corps as the United States has possessed, alongwith the chances to build up such a corps in the future, have been sabotaged byrecent investigation and dismissal. And, in the meantime, the military has beenand is moving into the higher councils of diplomacy.4The military establishment has, of course, long been economically relevant. TheCorps of Engineers—historically the elite of the West Pointers—has in peacetimecontrolled rivers and harbor construction. Local economic, as well asCongressional, interests have not been unaware of the pork-barrel possibilities,nor of the chance to have The Corps disapprove of the Reclamation Bureau’s plansfor multiple-purpose development of river valleys. ‘Actually’—we are told byArthur Maass in his discussion of ‘the lobby that can’t be licked’—‘up to about1925, the Corps disbursed 12 per cent of the total ordinary expeditures of thegovernment.’34 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en34]But now the economic relevance of the military establishment is on aqualitatively different scale.* [page_212.html#pg212fn1a] The national budgethas increased, and within it the percentage spent by and for the military. Sincejust before World War II, the percentage has never gone below about 30 per cent,and it has averaged over 50 per cent, of the entire government budget. In fact,two out of every three dollars in the budget announced in 1955 was marked formilitary security.36 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en36] And as the role of government inthe economy has increased, so has the role of the military in the government.We should constantly keep in mind how recent the military ascendancy is. DuringWorld War I the military entered the higher economic and political circles onlytemporarily, for the ‘emergency’; it was not until World War II that theyintervened in a truly decisive way. Given the nature of modern warfare, they hadto do so whether they wanted to or not, just as they had to invite men ofeconomic power into the military. For unless the military sat in on corporatedecisions, they could not be sure that their programs would be carried out; andunless the corporation chieftains knew something of the war plans, they couldnot plan war production. Thus, generals advised corporation presidents andcorporation presidents advised generals. ‘My first act on becoming Chief ofOrdnance of June 1, 1942,’ Lt. General Levin H. Campbell, Jr., has said, ‘was toestablish a personal advisory staff consisting of four outstanding business andindustrial leaders who were thoroughly familiar with all phases of massproduction.’37 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en37]During World War II, the merger of the corporate economy and the militarybureaucracy came into its present-day significance. The very scale of the‘services of supply’ could not but be economically decisive: The Services ofSupply, Fortune remarked in 1942, ‘might … be likened to a holding company of nomean proportions. In fact—charged with spending this year some $32 billion, or42 per cent of all that the U.S. will spend for war—it makes U.S. Steel looklike a fly-by-night, the A.T. and T. like a country-hotel switchboard, JesseJones’s RFC or any other government agency like a small-town boondoggle. In allof Washington, indeed, there is scarcely a door—from Harry Hopkins’s MunitionsAssignments Board on down—in which [General] Somervell or his lieutenants havenot come to beg, to borrow, or to steal.’38 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en38] The veryorganization of the economics of war made for the coincidence of interest andthe political mingling among economic and military chiefs: ‘The Chief ofOrdnance has an advisory staff composed of Bernard M. Baruch, Lewis H. Brown ofJohns-Manville Corp., K. T. Keller of Chrysler Corp., and Benjamin F. Fairlessof United States Steel Corp. Ordnance contracts are placed by four main branches… Each branch director … [is] assisted by an advisory industrial group, composedof representatives of the major producers of weapons in which the branchdeals.’39 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en39]The military establishment and the corporations were of course formally underthe control of civilian politicians. As managers of the largest corporate bodyin America, ‘the military had a board of directors … the President, the serviceSecretaries, the men on the military-affairs committees of Congress. Yet many ofthe men on the board, i.e., the Congressmen, can really do little more thanexpress general confidence, or the lack of it, in the management. Even the mostinfluential directors, the President and the Secretary of Defense, can usuallyargue with the management only as laymen arguing with professionals—asignificantly different relationship from that of board and management inindustry.’40 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en40]The coming together of the corporations and the military was most dramaticallyrevealed in their agreement upon the timing and the rules of ‘reconversion.’ Themilitary might lose power; the corporations would no longer produce under theprime contracts they held; reconversion, if not handled carefully, could easilydisturb the patterns of monopoly prevailing before war production began. Thegenerals and the dollar-a-year executives saw to it that this did not happen.41[ch15_notes.html#ch9en41]After World War II, military demands continued to shape and to pace thecorporate economy. It is accordingly not surprising that during the last decade,many generals and admirals, instead of merely retiring, have become members ofboards of directors.* [page_214.html#pg214fn1a]It is difficult to avoid the inference that the warlords, in their trade of famefor fortune, are found useful by the corporate executives more because of whomthey know in the military and what they know of its rules and ways than becauseof what they know of finance and industry proper. Given the major contracts thatare made by the military with private corporations, we can readily understandwhy business journalists openly state: ‘McNarney knows Convair’s best customer,The Pentagon, as few others do—a fact well known to his friend, Floyd Odium,Convair chairman.’ And ‘in business circles the word has gone out: Get yourselfa general. What branch of the government spends the most money? The military.Who, even more than a five-percenter, is an expert on red tape? A general or anadmiral. So make him Chairman of the Board.’43 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en43]The increased personnel traffic that goes on between the military and thecorporate realms, however, is more important as one clue to a structural factabout the United States than as an expeditious means of handling war contracts.Back of this shift at the top, and behind the increased military budget uponwhich it rests, there lies the great structural shift of modern Americancapitalism toward a permanent war economy.Within the span of one generation, America has become the leading industrialsociety of the world, and at the same time one or the leading military states.The younger military are of course growing up in the atmosphere of theeconomic-military alliance, but more than that they are being intensively andexplicitly educated to carry it on. ‘The Industrial College of the ArmedForces,’ concerned with the interdependence of economy and warfare, is at thetop level of the military educational system.44 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en44]To the optimistic liberal of the nineteenth century all this would appear a mostparadoxical fact. Most representatives of liberalism at that time assumed thatthe growth of industrialism would quickly relegate militarism to a very minorrole in modern affairs. Under the amiable canons of the industrial society, theheroic violence of the military state would simply disappear. Did not the riseof industrialism and the long era of nineteenth-century peace reveal as much?But the classic liberal expectation of men like Herbert Spencer has proved quitemistaken. What the main drift of the twentieth century has revealed is that asthe economy has become concentrated and incorporated into great hierarchies, themilitary has become enlarged and decisive to the shape of the entire economicstructure; and, moreover, the economic and the military have become structurallyand deeply interrelated, as the economy has become a seemingly permanent wareconomy; and military men and policies have increasingly penetrated thecorporate economy.* [page_215.html#pg215fn1a]‘What officials fear more than dateless war in Korea,’ Arthur Krock reported inApril of 1953, ‘is peace … The vision of peace which could lure the free worldinto letting down its guard, and demolishing the slow and costly process ofbuilding collective security in western Europe while the Soviets maintained andincreased their military power, is enough to make men in office indecisive. Andthe stock market selling that followed the sudden conciliatory overtures fromthe Kremlin supports the thesis that immediate prosperity in this country islinked to a war economy and suggests desperate economic problems that may ariseon the home front.’45 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en45]5Scientific and technological development, once seated in the economy, hasincreasingly become part of the military order, which is now the largest singlesupporter and director of scientific research in fact, as large, dollar-wise, asall other American research put together. Since World War II, the generaldirection of pure scientific research has been set by military considerations,its major finances are from military funds, and very few of those engaged inbasic scientific research are not working under military direction.The United States has never been a leader in basic research, which it hasimported from Europe. Just before World War II, some $40 million—the bulk of itfrom industry—was spent for basic scientific research; but $227 million wasspent on applied research and ‘product development and engineering.’46[ch15_notes.html#ch9en46] With the Second World War pure scientists were busy,but not in basic research. The atom program, by the time it became governmental,was for the most part an engineering problem. But such technologicaldevelopments made it clear that the nations of the world were entering ascientific, as well as an armaments, race. In the lack of any political policiesfor science, the military, first the navy, then the army, began to move into thefield of scientific direction and support, both pure and applied. Theirencroachment was invited or allowed by corporate officials who preferredmilitary rather than civilian control of governmental endeavors in science, outof fear of ‘ideological’ views of civilians concerning such things as patents.By 1954, the government was spending about $2 billion on research (twenty timesthe prewar rate); and 85 per cent of it was for ‘national security.’47[ch15_notes.html#ch9en47] In private industry and in the larger universities,the support of pure science is now dominantly a military support. Someuniversities, in fact, are financial branches of the military establishment,receiving three or four times as much money from military as from all othersources combined. During the war, four leading institutions of learning receiveda total of more than $200 million in research contracts—not including atomresearch, for which exact figures are lacking.The general tendency for the militarization of science has continued into theyears of peace. That fact, as The National Science Foundation has made clear, isresponsible for the relative neglect of ‘fundamental science.’ Out of the $2billion scientific budget of 1955, only $120 million (6 per cent) was for basicresearch, but, as we have said, 85 per cent was for military technology.48[ch15_notes.html#ch9en48]The military ascendancy in the world of science is more dramatically revealed bythe troubled atmosphere which the military’s ‘risk system’ has brought about. ByOctober of 1954, this had reached the point at which Dr. Vannevar Bush—World WarII Chief of the Office of Scientific Research and Development—felt it necessaryto assert flatly that the scientific community was ‘demoralized.’ ‘You won’tfind any strikes…’ he said, ‘but scientists today are discouraged anddownhearted and feel that they are being pushed out, and they are.’49[ch15_notes.html#ch9en49] In the context of distrust, no less a scientist thanAlbert Einstein publicly asserted: ‘If I would be a young man again and had todecide how to make my living, I would not try to become a scientist or scholaror teacher. I would rather choose to be a plumber or a peddler in the hope tofind that modest degree of independence still available under presentcircumstances.’50 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en50]Although there are perhaps 600,000 engineers and scientists in the UnitedStates, only some 125,000 of them are active in research, and of these perhaps75,000 are researching for industry in its pursuit of new commercial products,and another 40,000 are in developmental engineering. There are only 10,000scientists engaged in fundamental research in all branches, and informed opinionhas it that the top-rate creators number no more than one or two thousand.51[ch15_notes.html#ch9en51]It is these senior circles that have become deeply involved in the politics ofmilitary decisions, and the militarization of political life. In the lastfifteen years, they have moved into the vacuurr of theoretical military studies,in which strategy and policy become virtually one. It is a vacuum because,historically—as Theodore H. White has pointed out—the American warlords have notconcerned themselves with it, being more engaged in ‘technique’ than ‘theory.’Accordingly, as part of the military ascendancy, there is the felt need of thewarlords for theory, the militarization of science, and the present‘demoralization’ of the scientist in the service of the warlord.52[ch15_notes.html#ch9en52]In educational institutions the pursuit of knowledge has been linked with thetraining of men to enact special roles in all areas of modern society. Themilitary, in addition to their own schools, have used and increasingly use theeducational facilities of private and public educational institutions.*[page_218.html#pg218fn1a] As of 1953, almost 40 per cent of the male students of372 colleges and universities were enrolled in officer-training programs ofarmy, navy or air force. The liberal arts institutions involved were devotingabout 16 per cent of their curriculum to the military courses. For the nation asa whole, about one out of five students were in ROTC units, an unprecedentedproportion for a year of formal peace.53 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en53]During World War II, the military had begun to use the colleges and universitiesfor specialist training, as well as for the military training of students inaccelerated courses. And the specialist training, as well as the heavy researchprograms, has continued after the war.Today, many colleges and universities are eager to have military programs oftraining and research established on their campuses. It is prestigeful and it isfinancially sound. Moreover, the list of military men who, most of them withoutany specific educational qualifications, have come to serve as collegeadministrators, and in other educational capacities, is impressive. GeneralEisenhower, of course, on his way to the Presidency, was the head of ColumbiaUniversity, as well as a member of the National Educational Association PolicyCommission. And even a casual survey reveals a dozen or so military men ineducational positions.* [page_219.html#pg219fn1a]There has been a good deal of tension between the schools and the military. Inthe case of the Armed Forces Institute—a correspondence school for men in theservice—one clause in the contract with universities gives the military directpower over university personnel, in case they are ‘disapproved’ by thegovernment: as of August 1953, twenty-eight universities had signed, fourteenhad rejected, and five were pending.55 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en55] But in general,the acceptance by the educators of the military has been accomplished withoutsuch misunderstandings; it has been accomplished during the war and after it,because many schools need financial support; the federal government has notprovided it under civilian control, but the military has had it to provide.6It is not only within the higher political and economic, scientific andeducational circles that the military ascendancy is apparent. The warlords,along with fellow travelers and spokesmen, are attempting to plant theirmetaphysics firmly among the population at large.During World War II, sympathizers of the warlords came out into the open asspokesmen for militarism. The wartime speeches of Mr. Frank Knox, of Mr. CharlesE. Wilson (G.E.), and of James Forrestal—for example—were rich in militaryimages of the future held by key men of power, and the images have by no meansfaded. Since World War II, in fact, the warlords have caused a large-scale andintensive public-relations program to be carried out. They have spent millionsof dollars and they have employed thousands of skilled publicists, in and out ofuniform, in order to sell their ideas and themselves to the public and to theCongress.The content of this great effort reveals its fundamental purpose: to define thereality of international relations in a military way, to portray the armedforces in a manner attractive to civilians, and thus to emphasize the need forthe expansion of military facilities. The aim is to build the prestige of themilitary establishment and to create respect for its personnel, and thus toprepare the public for military-approved policies, and to make Congress readyand willing to pay for them. There is also, of course, the intention of readyingthe public for the advent of war.To achieve these ends, the warlords of Washington have at hand extensive meansof communication and public relations. Daily, in war and in peace, they releaseitems and stories to the press and to the three or four dozen newsmen housed inthe newsroom of the Pentagon. They prepare scripts, make recordings, and takepictures for radio and TV outlets; they maintain the largest motion-picturestudio in the East, bought from Paramount in 1942. They are ready to servemagazine editors with prepared copy. They arrange speaking engagements formilitary personnel and provide the speeches. They establish liaison withimportant national organizations, and arrange orientation conferences and fieldtrips for their leaders, as well as for executives and key people in thebusiness, the educational, the religious, the entertainment worlds. They havearranged, in some 600 communities, ‘advisory committees’ which open the way totheir messages and advise them of unfavorable reactions.56[ch15_notes.html#ch9en56]Everything that appears in the news or on the air that concerns the military issummarized and analyzed; and everything which they release, including thewriting of retired warlords, is reviewed and censored.The cost of this program varies from year to year, but interested Senators haveestimated it as between $5 million and $12 million. Such estimates, however,mean little, for the position of the military is such that they were able toenjoy, during one twelve-month period, some $30 million worth of motionpictures, which they co-operated in producing; obtain millions of dollars worthof free time on TV, and, according to Variety’s estimate, about $6 million offree radio time.Nor does the 1951 estimate of Senator Harry F. Byrd (of 2,235 military and 787civilians in publicity, advertising, and public relations) accurately reveal thescale of the program. For it is not difficult to use, at least part-time, manyservice personnel for public-relations purposes. Top admirals and generals, ofcourse, have their own public-relations men. In 1948, General MacArthur’scommand included one hundred thirty-five army men and forty civilians assignedto publicity. Eisenhower, when Chief of Staff, had forty-four military and onehundred thirteen civilians.57 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en57] And the warlordsthemselves have been learning the ways of publicity. Recently the retiring AirForce Chief of Staff, General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, told graduates at an air forcebase that ‘the greatest fraternity on the face of the earth are the people whowear wings … You’re not just jet jockeys … Take up the broader duty ofunderstanding and preaching the role of air power … The people who won’t facethe truth … must be told repeatedly, earnestly, logically that air power willsave the world from destruction …’58 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en58]It is a delicate problem which the military publicists confront, but there isone great fact that works entirely for their success: in all of pluralistAmerica, there is no interest—there is no possible combination of interests—thathas anywhere near the time, the money, the manpower, to present a point of viewon the issues involved that can effectively compete with the views presented dayin and day out by the warlords and by those whom they employ.59[ch15_notes.html#ch9en59]This means, for one thing, that there is no free and wide debate of militarypolicy or of policies of military relevance. But that, of course, is in linewith the professional soldier’s training for command and obedience, and with hisethos, which is certainly not that of a debating society in which decisions areput to a vote. It is also in line with the tendency in a mass society formanipulation to replace explicitly debated authority, as well as with the factof total war in which the distinction between soldier and civilian isobliterated. The military manipulation of civilian opinion and the militaryinvasion of the civilian mind are now important ways in which the power of thewarlords is steadily exerted.The extent of the military publicity, and the absence of opposition to it, alsomeans that it is not merely this proposal or that point of view that is beingpushed. In the absence of contrasting views, the very highest form of propagandawarfare can be fought: the propaganda for a definition of reality within whichonly certain limited viewpoints are possible. What is being promulgated andreinforced is the military metaphysics—the cast of mind that definesinternational reality as basically military. The publicists of the militaryascendancy need not really work to indoctrinate with this metaphysics those whocount: they have already accepted it.7In contrast with the existence of military men, conceived simply as experts inorganizing and using violence, ‘militarism’ has been defined as ‘a case of thedominance of means over ends’ for the purpose of heightening the prestige andincreasing the power of the military.60 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en60] This is, ofcourse, a conception from the standpoint of the civilian who would consider themilitary as strictly a means for civilian political ends. As a definition, itpoints to the tendency of military men not to remain means, but to pursue endsof their own, and to turn other institutional areas into means for accomplishingthem.Without an industrial economy, the modern army, as in America, could not exist;it is an army of machines. Professional economists usually consider militaryinstitutions as parasitic upon the means of production. Now, however, suchinstitutions have come to shape much of the economic life of the United States.Religion, virtually without fail, provides the army at war with its blessings,and recruits from among its officials the chaplain, who in military costumecounsels and consoles and stiffens the morale of men at war. By constitutionaldefinition, the military is subordinated to political authority, and isgenerally considered, and has generally been, a servant as well as an adviser ofcivilian politicians; but the warlord is moving into these circles, and by hisdefinitions of reality, influencing their decisions. The family provides thearmy and navy with the best men and boys that it possesses. And, as we haveseen, education and science too are becoming means to the ends sought by themilitary.The military pursuit of status, in itself, is no threat of military dominance.In fact, well enclosed in the standing army, such status is a sort of pay-offfor the military relinquishment of adventures in political power. So long asthis pursuit of status is confined to the military hierarchy itself, it is animportant feature of military discipline, and no doubt a major source of muchmilitary gratification. It becomes a threat, and it is an indication of thegrowing power of the military elite today, when it is claimed outside themilitary hierarchy and when it tends to become a basis of military policy.The key to an understanding of status is power. The military cannot successfullyclaim status among civilians if they do not have, or are not thought to havepower. Now power, as well as images of it, are always relative: one man’s powersare another man’s weaknesses. And the powers that have weakened the status ofthe military in America have been the powers of money and of money-makers, andthe powers of the civilian politicians over the military establishment.American ‘militarism,’ accordingly, involves the attempt of military men toincrease their powers, and hence their status, in comparison with businessmenand politicians. To gain such powers they must not be considered a mere means tobe used by politicians and money-makers. They must not be considered parasiteson the economy and under the supervision of those who are often called inmilitary circles ‘the dirty politicians.’ On the contrary, their ends must beidentified with the ends as well as the honor of the nation; the economy must betheir servant; politics an instrument by which, in the name of the state, thefamily, and God, they manage the nation in modern war. ‘What does it mean to goto war?’ Woodrow Wilson was asked in 1917. ‘It means,’ he replied, ‘an attemptto reconstruct a peacetime civilization with war standards, and at the end ofthe war there will be no bystanders with sufficient peace standards left to workwith. There will be only war standards …’61 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en61] Americanmilitarism, in fully developed form, would mean the triumph in all areas of lifeof the military meta-physic, and hence the subordination to it of all other waysof life.There can be little doubt but that, over the last decade, the warlords ofWashington, with their friends in the political directorate and the corporateelite, have definitely revealed militaristic tendencies. Is there, then, in thehigher circles of America ‘a military clique’? Those who argue about such anotion—as Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas and General of the Army OmarBradley have recently done63 [ch15_notes.html#ch9en62]—are usually arguing onlyabout the increased influence of the professional military. That is why theirarguments, in so far as they bear upon the structure of the elite, are not verydefinitive and are usually at cross-purposes. For when it is fully understood,the idea of a military clique involves more than the military ascendancy. Itinvolves a coincidence of interests and a co-ordination of aims among economicand political as well as military actors.Our answer to the question, ‘Is there now a military clique?’ is: Yes, there isa military clique, but it is more accurately termed the power elite, for it iscomposed of economic, political, as well as military, men whose interests haveincreasingly coincided. In order to understand the role of the military withinthis power elite, we must understand the role of the corporation executive andthe politician within it. And we must also understand something of what has beenhappening in the political sphere of America."},{"pageContent":"10THE POLITICAL DIRECTORATETHE perfect candidate for the Presidency of the United States was born somefifty-four years ago in a modest but ramshackled farm house in the pivotal stateof Ohio. Of a sizable family, which arrived from England shortly after theMayflower, he grew up on the farm, performing the traditional chores and thusbecoming well acquainted with all farm problems. When he was in high school hisfather died, the farm was sold, his strong and sensible mother moved the familyto a near-by small town, and the struggle began.The future President worked in his uncle’s factory, quickly becoming a practicalexpert on all labor and management problems, while putting himself throughcollege. He arrived in France during World War I just in time to make clear, fora full six months, that, in another war with more time, he would undoubtedly bea statesman of note. Returning home, he went to the state law school for twoyears, married his high-school sweetheart, whose grandfathers fought with theConfederate armies, opened his office, and joined the local party club, as wellas the Elks, and in due course the Rotary Club, and attended the Episcopalianchurch. He is having a very busy life now, but he can stand such strains, for itis as if his constitution was built for them. During the ’twenties, herepresented a group of small factories in their relations with labor, and was sosuccessful that during the ’thirties there was no labor trouble of anyconsequence. Other companies, noting this as a remarkable fact, also engagedhim, and thus, with the publicity, he became mayor of his city in 1935.As the soldier-statesman and labor-relations expert took hold of the reins, bothbusiness and labor acclaimed the skill and vigor of his administration. Althoughan absolutely regular party man, he remodeled the city government from top tobottom. Came the Second World War, and despite his two young sons, he resignedhis mayoralty to become a lieutenant colonel, and a member of a favoredgeneral’s staff. He quickly became a statesman well versed in Asiatic andEuropean affairs and confidently predicted everything that happened.A brigadier general, he returned to Ohio after the war and found himself theoverwhelming choice for governor. For two terms he has been swept into office,his administration being as efficient as any business, as moral as any church,as warm-hearted as any family. His face is as honest as any businessexecutive’s, his manner as sincere as any salesman’s; in fact, he is somethingof both, with a touch of grimness and homely geniality all his own. And all ofthis comes through, magnetically, straight to you, through the lens of anycamera and the microphone as well.1 [ch15_notes.html#ch10en1]1Some of the features of this portrait are not too different from the averagemodern President’s to be recognizable, although perhaps their interpretation issomewhat unmeasured. Among those who have reached the top positions of theAmerican government one can find at least two or three who represent almostanything for which one looks. One could endlessly collect biographical anecdotesand colorful images about them—but these would not add up to any conclusionsabout the leading types of men and their usual careers. We must understand howhistory and biography have interplayed to shape the course of American politics,for every epoch selects and forms its own representative political men—as wellas prevailing images of them.That is the first point to bear in mind: many of the images of politicians thatprevail today are, in fact, drawn from earlier epochs. Accordingly, ‘TheAmerican Politician’ is seen as a valuable originator but also a cheap tool, ahigh statesman but also a dirty politician, a public servant but also a slyconniver. Our view is not clear because, as with most of our views of thoseabove us, we tend to understand our own time in accordance with the confusedstereotypes of previous periods.The classic commentaries of American politics—those of Tocqueville, Bryce, andOstrogorski—rest upon nineteenth-century experience—generally from AndrewJackson to Theodore Roosevelt. It is, of course, true that many of the trendsthat determined the political shape of the long middle period are still at workinfluencing the type of politician that prevails in our own politicaltimes—especially on the middle levels of power, in the Congress. But during thetwentieth century, and especially after the First World War, other forces havegreatly modified the content and the importance in America of politicalinstitutions. The political establishment of the United States has become moretightly knit, it has been enlarged in scope, and has come up closer to virtuallyall of the social institutions which it frames. Increasingly, crises have arisenthat have not seemed resolvable on the old local and decentralized basis;increasingly those involved in these crises have looked to the state to resolvethem. As these changes in the shape and practice of the state have increased thepower available to those who would gain power and exert it through politicalinstitutions, new types of political men have become ascendant.The higher politicians do not constitute any one psychological type; they cannotbe sorted out and understood in terms of any standard set of motives. Like menof other pursuits, politicians, high or low, are sometimes driven bytechnological love of their activities—of the campaigning and the conniving andthe holding of office; more frequently than others, they are drawn to politicsby the prestige that their success brings to them; in fact, ‘power for power’ssake’—a very complicated set of motives—usually involves the feeling of prestigewhich the exercise of power bestows.2 [ch15_notes.html#ch10en2] Rarely is it themoney they receive as officeholders which attracts them.The only general meaning we can give to ‘The Politician’ is the man who more orless regularly enacts a role in political institutions and thinks of it as atleast among his major activities. Accordingly, since there are two major kindsof political institutions in the United States, there are two major types of‘politicians.’The party politician’s working career is spent inside a specific kind ofpolitical organization: he is a party man. There is also the politicalprofessional whose career has been spent in the administrative areas ofgovernment, and who becomes ‘political’ to the extent that he rises above thecivil-service routine and into the policy-making levels. In the pure type, sucha politician is an exbureaucrat.As types, party politicians and political bureaucrats are the professionals ofmodern government, if only in the sense that their careers are spent mainlywithin the political orbit. But not all men who are in politics are professionalpoliticians either in the party sense or in the bureaucratic sense: in fact,today the men at the political top are much less likely to be bureaucrats, andrather less likely to be party politicians than political outsiders.The political outsider is a man who has spent the major part of his working lifeoutside strictly political organizations, and who—as the case may be—is broughtinto them, or who forces his way in, or who comes and goes in the politicalorder. He is occupationally formed by nonpolitical experience, his career andhis connections have been in other than political circles, and as apsychological type, he is anchored in other institutional areas. In fact, he isusually considered by the professionals as a representative or as an agentwithin the government of some non-governmental interest or group. The politicaloutsider is by no means confined to the Republican party. Under the Democrats,he is more likely to be on the make, striving to become acceptable to thecorporate chieftains; whereas, under the Republicans, he is more usually a manalready acceptable and therefore surer of himself and of how his decisions willbe interpreted by those who count. A further consequence is that under theRepublicans he can be less hypocritical.Such outsiders, of course, may become bureaucratic experts by spending much timein administrative work, and thus linking their careers and their expectations togovernment; they may become party politicians by cultivating their role inside apolitical party, and coming to base their power and their career upon theirparty connections. But they need not make either transition; they may simplymove into an inner circle, as an appointed consultant or adviser having intimateand trusted access to an official power-holder, to whom they are beholden forsuch political power as they possess.There are, to be sure, other ways of classifying men as political animals, butthese types—the party politician, the professional adiministrator, the politicaloutsider—are quite serviceable in understanding the social make-up andpsychological complexion of the political visage of present-day America.Within American political institutions, the center of initiative and decisionhas shifted from the Congress to the executive; the executive branch of thestate has not only expanded mightily but has come to centralize and to use thevery party which puts it into power. It has taken over more initiative inlegislative matters not only by its veto but by its expert counsel and advice.Accordingly, it is in the executive chambers, and in the agencies andauthorities and commissions and departments that stretch out beneath them, thatmany conflicts of interests and contests of power have come to a head—ratherthan in the open arena of politics of an older style.These institutional changes in the shape of the political pyramid have made thenew political command posts worthy of being struggled for. They have also madefor changes in the career of the type of political man who is ascendant. Theyhave meant that it is now more possible for the political career to leaddirectly to the top, thus by-passing local political life. In the middle of thenineteenth century—between 1865 and 1881—only 19 per cent of the men at the topof the government began their political career on the national level; but from1901 to 1953, about one-third of the political elite began there, and, in theEisenhower administration, some 42 per cent started in politics at the nationallevel—a high for the entire political history of the United States.*[page_229.html#pg229fn1a]From 1789 right up to 1921, generation after generation, the proportion of thepolitical elite which has ever held local or state offices decreased from 93 to69 per cent. In the Eisenhower administration, it fell to 57 per cent. Moreover,only 14 per cent of this current group—and only about one-quarter of earliertwentieth-century politicians—have ever served in any state legislature. In theFounding Fathers’ generation of 1789–1801, 81 per cent of the higher politicianshad done so. There has also been a definite decline in the proportions of higherpoliticians who have ever sat in the United States House of Representatives orin the Senate.* [page_230.html#pg230fn1a]The decline in state and local apprenticeships before entering nationalpositions, as well as the lack of legislative experience, tie in with anothercharacteristic trend. Since there are so many more elected positions on thelower and legislative levels and relatively few on the national, the more recentmembers of the political elite are likely to have reached their position throughappointments rather than elections. Once, most of the men who reached thepolitical top got there because people elected them up the hierarchy of offices.Until 1901, well over one-half, and usually more than two-thirds, of thepolitical elite had been elected to all or most of their positions beforereaching their highest national office. But of late, in a more administrativeage, men become big politically because small groups of men, themselves elected,appoint them: only 28 per cent of the higher politicians in 1933–53 rose largelyby means of elective offices; 9 per cent has as many appointed as electedoffices, and 62 per cent were appointed to all or most of their political jobsbefore reaching top position; 1 per cent had held no previous politicalposition. Among the Eisenhower group, 36 per cent were elected to the top; 50per cent had been appointed more than elected, and 14 per cent had never beforeheld any political office.For the American statesmen as a group, the median number of years spent inpolitics was 22.4; in non-political activities, 22.3. Thus, these top members ofgovernment have spent about the same time working in politics as in otherprofessions. (For some of these years, of course, they were working at both atthe same time.) But this over-all fact is somewhat misleading, for there is adefinite historical trend: until the Civil War, the top men spent more time inpolitics than in non-political pursuits. Since the Civil War, the typical memberof the political elite has spent more years working outside of politics than init. Strictly political careers reached a peak in the generation of 1801–25, with65 per cent of the total working life spent in politics. Outside activitiesreached their peak in the Progressive Era, 1901–21: at that time, professionalsand reformers seem briefly to have entered high political positions, 72 per centof this generation’s active working time being taken up by non-politicalactivities. It is not possible to make this calculation for politicians since1933 for their careers are not yet over.All these tendencies—(I) for the political elite to begin on the national leveland thus to by-pass local and state offices, (II) never to serve in nationallegislative bodies, (III) to have more of an appointed than an elected career,and (IV) to spend less proportions of their total working life in politics—thesetendencies point to the decline of the legislative body and to the by-passing ofelective offices in the higher political career. They signify the‘bureaucratization’ of politics and the decline at the political top of men whoare professional politicians in the simple, old-fashioned sense of being electedup the political hierarchy and experienced in electoral politics. They point, inshort, to the political outsider. Although this type has prevailed in previousperiods, in our time he flourishes, and in the Eisenhower administration he hasbecome ascendant. This administration, in fact, is largely an inner circle ofpolitical outsiders who have taken over the key executive posts ofadministrative command; it is composed of members and agents of the corporaterich and of the high military in an uneasy alliance with selected professionalparty politicians seated primarily in the Congress, whose interests andassociations are spread over a variety of local societies.2A small group of men are now in charge of the executive decisions made in thename of the United States of America. These fifty-odd men of the executivebranch of the government include the President, the Vice President, and themembers of the cabinet; the head men of the major departments and bureaus,agencies and commissions, and the members of the Executive Office of thePresident, including the White House staff.Only three of these members of the political directorate*[page_231.html#pg231fn1a] are professional party politicians in the sense ofhaving spent most of their working lives running for and occupying electiveoffices; and only two have spent most of their careers as ‘behind-the-scenes’political managers or ‘fixers.’ Only nine have spent their careers withingovernmental hierarchies—three of them in the military; four as civil servantsin civilian government; and two in a series of appointive positions not underthe civil-service system. Thus, a total of only fourteen (or about one-fourth)of these fifty-three executive directors have by virtue of their career been‘professionals’ of government administration or party politics.The remaining three-quarters are political outsiders. At one time or another,several of them have been elected to political offices, and some have enteredgovernment service for short periods but, for most of their careers, they havegenerally worked outside the realms of government and politics. Most of theseoutsiders—thirty of the thirty-nine in fact—are quite closely linked,financially or professionally or both, with the corporate world, and thus makeup slightly over half of all the political directors. The remainder have beenactive in various other ‘professional’ fields.The three top policy-making positions in the country (secretaries of state,treasury, and defense) are occupied by a New York representative of the leadinglaw firm of the country which does international business for Morgan andRockefeller interests; by a Mid-West corporation executive who was a director ofa complex of over thirty corporations; and by the former president of one of thethree or four largest corporations and the largest producer of militaryequipment in the United States.There are four more members of the corporate rich in the cabinet—two more menfrom General Motors; a leading financier and director of New England’s largestbank; and a millionaire publisher from Texas. The positions of Secretaries ofAgriculture and Labor are occupied by professional outsiders, leaving only onecabinet member who is an insider to politics and government—theAttorney-General, who has been both a New York State Assemblyman and a partnerin the law firm of Lord, Day and Lord, but has, since 1942, been a politicalmanager for Dewey and later Eisenhower.Although the Attorney-General and Vice-President are the only politicalprofessionals, two other cabinet members have at one time held elective stateoffices and at least five of the cabinet members were active in the politicalcampaign of 1952. None of them are, in any sense that may be given to the term,civil servants; the President is alone among them as a man trained in agovernmental (military) bureaucracy.On the ‘second team’ of the political directorate, there is a ‘Little Cabinet,’whose members stand in for the first and, who, in fact, handle most of theadministrative functions of governing. Among the top thirty-two deputies of theagencies, departments, and commissions, twenty-one are novices in government:many of them never held political office, nor in fact even worked in government,before their present positions. These men usually have had fathers who were bigbusinessmen; twelve attended Ivy League colleges; and they themselves have oftenbeen businessmen or bankers or the salaried lawyers of large corporations ormembers of the big law firms. Unlike professional politicians, they do notbelong to the local jamboree of Elk and Legion; they are more often members ofquiet social clubs and exclusive country clubs. Their origins, their careers,and their associations make them representative of the corporate rich.On this ‘second team’ there is one Rockefeller as well as a former financialadviser to the Rockefellers; there are working inheritors of family power andtextile companies; there are bankers; there is a publisher, an airlineexecutive, and lawyers; a representative from the southwestern affiliate ofAmerica’s largest corporation; and another man from General Motors. There isalso Allen Dulles who spent ten years in the diplomatic service, left it(because a promotion in rank offered him no increase above his $8,000 salary) tojoin the law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell (about the time that his brotherbecame its senior partner) and then returned to the government as its seniorspy. On this second team there are also four men who have not been directlyassociated with the corporate world.Only seven of the thirty-two members of the second team have been trained ingovernmental bureaucracies; only four have had considerable experience in partypolitics.In the complex organization of modern government, the need for an ‘inner circle’of personal advisers has become increasingly important to the executive,especially if he would be an innovator. In order to originate and carry out hispolicies, he needs men who are quite wholly in his service. The specificfunctions that these men may perform are enormously varied; but, in whateverthey do and say, they function as the alter ego of their commander. Thesepersonal lieutenants of power are loyal agents, first of all, of the man towhose inner circle they belong. They may be professional politicians orprofessional civil servants, but usually they have been neither.And yet they must mediate between party politicians in the legislative branchand the outsiders in the executive administration—as well as among the variousoutside pressure groups—and they must maintain public relations with theunorganized public. These men on the White House Staff, therefore, are not inoffice so much for what they represent as for what they can do. They are avariety of skilled men, and they are socially alike in a number of ways: theyare quite young; they come from the urban areas of the country, in fact from theEast; and they are likely to have attended the Ivy League Colleges.Of the nine key members of the White House Staff, six are novices in governmentand politics; there are no civilian civil servants; there is one professionalparty politician; one professional political manager; and one professionalmilitary man. The men of the President’s inner circle thus come from Dewey’sinner circle, from Henry Luce’s, or from the higher levels of the Pentagon. Withfew exceptions, they are neither professional party politicians nor politicalbureaucrats.* [page_234.html#pg234fn1a]As a group, the political outsiders who occupy the executive command posts andform the political directorate are legal, managerial, and financial members ofthe corporate rich. They are members of cliques in which they have shown totheir higher-ups that they are trustworthy in economic or military or politicalendeavors. For corporation executives and army generals, no less thanprofessional politicians, have their ‘old cronies.’ Neither bureaucraticadvancement nor party patronage is the rule of the political outsider. As in theprivate corporation, the rule is the co-optation of one’s own kind by those whohave taken over the command posts.3The rise of the political outsider within the modern political directorate isnot simply one more aspect of the ‘bureaucratization’ of the state. In fact, asin the case of the military ascendancy, the problem which the rise of thepolitical outsider creates for the democratic theorist has, first of all, to dowith the absence of a genuine bureaucracy. For it is partly in lieu of a genuinebureaucracy that the pseudo-bureaucracy of the political outsiders, as well asthe regime of the party hacks, has come to prevail.By a ‘genuine’ bureaucracy, we refer to an organized hierarchy of skills andauthorities, within which each office and rank is restricted to its specializedtasks. Those who occupy these offices do not own the equipment required fortheir duties, and they, personally, have no authority: the authority they wieldis vested in the offices they occupy. Their salary, along with the honor dueeach rank, is the sole remuneration offered.The bureaucrat or civil servant, accordingly, is above all an expert whoseknowledge and skill have been attested to by qualifying examination, and laterin his career, qualifying experience. As a specially qualified man, his accessto his office and his advancement to higher offices are regulated by more orless formal tests of competence. By aspiration and by achievement, he is set fora career, regulated according to merit and seniority, within the prearrangedhierarchy of the bureaucracy. He is, moreover, a disciplined man, whose conductcan be readily calculated, and who will carry out policies even if they goagainst his grain, for his ‘merely personal opinions’ are strictly segregatedfrom his official life, outlook, and duties. Socially, the bureaucrat is likelyto be rather formal with his colleagues, as the smooth functioning of abureaucratic hierarchy requires a proper balance between personal good will andadequate social distance according to rank.Even if its members only approximate the principled image of such a man, thebureaucracy is a most efficient form of human organization. But such anorganized corps is quite difficult to develop, and the attempt can easily resultin an apparatus that is obstreperous and clumsy, hide-bound and snarled withprocedure, rather than an instrument of policy.The integrity of a bureaucracy as a unit of a government depends upon whether ornot, as a corps of officials, it survives changes of political administration.The integrity of a professional bureaucrat depends upon whether or not hisofficial conduct, and even his person, embodies the status codes of theofficial, foremost among them political neutrality. He will serve a newpolitical administration and its policies as faithfully as he did the old. Thatis the political meaning of genuine bureaucracy. For the bureaucrat as such doesnot make policy; he provides information relevant to alternative policies and hecarries out the alternative that becomes official. As a more or less permanentstaff with a more or less permanent hierarchy beneath it, the bureaucracy isloyal only to the policies that are given it to execute. ‘It has been recognizedalmost universally,’ Herman Finer asserts, ‘that interference with thisneutrality [from political parties] means the loss of technical skill to thestate as a whole, and only the most extreme minorities of the Left and Righthave been ready to sacrifice this neutrality by “purification” of theservices.’8 [ch15_notes.html#ch10en8]The civilian government of the United States never has had and does not now havea genuine bureaucracy. In the civil-service system, established in 1883, peopleappointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate are not ‘required to beclassified.’ What constitutes ‘The Civil Service’ can change with changingpolitical administrations. Any rules of competitive recruitment can be by-passedby creating whole new agencies without established precedents; jobs can beclassified and declassified in and out of the civil-service tenure andrestriction; civil-service tenure can be made meaningless by the wholesaleabolition of governmental agencies or parts thereof, not only by the Congressbut by the head of the agency or by the Budget Bureau.9[ch15_notes.html#ch10en9]Of the late nineteenth-century practice, an English observer noted that ‘whileappointments to the lower grades were filled on the basis of merit, the pressurefor spoils at each change of administration forced inexperienced, political orpersonal favourites in at the top. This blocked promotions and demoralized theservice. Thus, while the general effect of the act was to limit very greatly thenumber of vicious appointments, at the same time the effect of these exceptionswas to confine them to the upper grades, where the demoralizing effects of eachupon the service would be a maximum.’10 [ch15_notes.html#ch10en10]Since then, of course, the proportion of employees covered by the Civil Servicehas increased. At the end of Theodore Roosevelt’s administration (in 1909) some60 per cent of all federal civilian employees were civil service; at thebeginning of Franklin Roosevelt’s, about 80 per cent. Much of the New Dealexpansion involved ‘new agencies which were staffed without competitivecivil-service examinations. By 1936 only 60 per cent of Government civilianemployees had entered Government through competitive civil-service tests; manyof the [remaining] 40 per cent were patronage appointments, and most of themwere New Deal enthusiasts.’ World War II brought another huge wave of governmentemployees who did not win their jobs competitively. Once in, however, thesegovernment workers found civil-service protection; when President Truman leftoffice in 1953, the tenure of ‘at least 95 per cent of Government civilianemployees’ was presumably protected.11 [ch15_notes.html#ch10en11]Now of the two million or so government employees,12 [ch15_notes.html#ch10en12]perhaps some 1500 can be considered ‘key officials’: these include the head menof the executive departments, under-secretaries and assistant secretaries, thechiefs of the independent agencies and their deputy and assistant heads, thechiefs of the various bureaus and their deputies, the ambassadors and otherchiefs of missions.13 [ch15_notes.html#ch10en13] Occupationally they includelawyers and air force officers, economists and physicians, engineers andaccountants, aeronautical experts and bankers, chemists and newspaper men,diplomats and soldiers. Altogether, they occupy the key administrative,technical, military, and professional positions of the federal government.In 1948, only 32 per cent (502) of such key officials worked in agencies whichhad a ‘formal career service’—such as the foreign service of the Department ofState, the military hierarchy, certain appointments in the Public HealthService. The top career men averaged twenty-nine years in government service;over half of them had earned graduate or professional degrees; one-fourth, infact, attended Harvard, Columbia, Princeton, Yale, MIT, or Cornell. Theserepresented such higher civil service as the government then contained.Two months before the party nominations for the 1952 elections, Harold E.Talbott—a New York financier, later a Secretary of the Air Force exposed forusing his office for private gain—hired a management consulting firm todetermine what posts it would be necessary for a Republican administration totake over in order to control the government of the United States. A few daysafter his election, Eisenhower received a fourteen-volume analysis—includingsuggested qualifications for appointees and the main problems they would face—ofeach of the 250 to 300 top policy-making jobs that were found.14[ch15_notes.html#ch10en14]More party-minded analysts knew that even under the laws and orders thenexisting, some 2,000 positions seemed open.15 [ch15_notes.html#ch10en15]Patronage is patronage, and the new administration quickly set about findingways of increasing it.* [page_239.html#pg239fn1a] In April 1953, Eisenhower byexecutive order stripped job security from at least 800 ‘confidential andpolicy-making’ government workers; in June, he released some 54,000 non-veteransfrom job security.17 [ch15_notes.html#ch10en17]The exact number of positions that the Republicans declassified is difficult toknow with accuracy: one knowledgeable estimate puts the number at 134,000.18[ch15_notes.html#ch10en18] But the withdrawal of jobs from civil-servicecoverage is not the only way to get in one’s own people. Under a security rulingwhich rests upon ‘a reasonable doubt’ of someone’s ‘security-risk’ status,rather than ‘proof,’ and which places the burden of proof upon the accused,thousands more have been fired or forced to resign from government service. Thishas been especially damaging to the experienced personnel and morale of theState Department where such attacks have been most prolific and systematic.**[page_239.html#pg239fn2a]The details at any given time are not important; the over-all fact is: TheUnited States has never and does not now have a genuine civil service, in thefundamental sense of a reliable civil-service career, or of an independentbureaucracy effectively above political party pressure. The fact of the longDemocratic tenure (1933–53) had tended to hide the extent to which thecivil-service laws had failed to result in the creation of a Civil Service. Thechangeover of 1953 revealed, further, that the civil-service laws merely makethe operation of ‘patronage’ more difficult and more expensive, and also, as itturned out, somewhat nastier. For there is no real question but that ‘securityclearance’ procedures have been used to cover the replacement of untrustworthyDemocrat by trustworthy Republican.The superior man who might be bent on a professional career in government isnaturally not disposed to train himself for such political perils andadministrative helplessness.No intellectually qualified personnel for a genuine bureaucracy can be providedif the Civil Service is kept in a political state of apprehension; for thatselects mediocrities and trains them for unreflective conformity.No morally qualified personnel can be provided if civil servants must work in acontext of universal distrust, paralyzed by suspicion and fear.And in a society that values money as the foremost gauge of caliber, no trulyindependent Civil Service can be built—either from upper or middle-classrecruits, if it does not provide compensation comparable to that provided byprivate employment. Pensions and security of job do not make up for the lowerpay of civil servants, for private executives, as we have seen, now have suchprivileges and many more as well. The top civil-service salary in 1954 was only$14,800, and only 1 per cent of all the federal employees earned over $9,000 ayear.19 [ch15_notes.html#ch10en19]The historical check upon the development of an administrative bureaucracy inthe United States has been the patronage system of the parties, which asmachines use jobs for pay-offs, thus making impossible office discipline andrecruitment on the basis of expert qualification. In addition, since governmentregulation of business has become important, a government job has becomeimportant as one link in a business or legal career in the private corporateworld. One serves a term in the agency which has to do with the industry one isgoing to enter. In the regulatory agencies especially, public offices are oftenstepping stpnes in a corporate career, and as organizations the agencies areoutposts of the private corporate world. And there is also the ‘new spoilssystem’ operating as a security measure in the context of distrust.Magazines for business executives and ghost writers for politicians regularlyrun pious editorials on the need for a better Civil Service. But neitherexecutives nor politicians really want a group of expert administrators who aregenuinely independent of party considerations, and who, by training andexperience, are the depository of the kind of skills needed to judge carefullythe consequences of alternative policies. The political and economic meaning ofsuch a corps for responsible government is all too clear.In the lower ranks of the state hierarchy, from which genuine civil servantsmight be recruited, there has not been enough prestige or money to attractreally first-rate men. In the upper ranks, ‘outsiders,’ that is, men fromoutside the bureaucracy, have been called upon. They have served only forrelatively short periods and not as a life career, and hence they have notacquired the neutrality and demeanor associated with the ideal civil servant.There is no civil-service career that is secure enough, there is noadministrative corps that is permanent enough, to survive a change-over ofpolitical administration in the United States. Neither professional partypoliticians, nor professional bureaucrats are now at the executive centers ofdecision. Those centers are occupied by the political directorate of the powerelite."},{"pageContent":"11THE THEORY OF BALANCENOT wishing to be disturbed over moral issues of the political economy,Americans cling to the idea that the government is a sort of automatic machine,regulated by the balancing of competing interests. This image of politics issimply a carry-over from the official image of the economy: in both, anequilibrium is achieved by the pulling and hauling of many interests, eachrestrained only by legalistic and amoral interpretations of what the trafficwill bear.The ideal of the automatic balance reached its most compelling elaboration ineighteenth-century economic terms: the market is sovereign and in the magiceconomy of the small entrepreneur there is no authoritarian center. And in thepolitical sphere as well: the division, the equilibrium, of powers prevails, andhence there is no chance of despotism. ‘The nation which will not adopt anequilibrium of power,’ John Adams wrote, ‘must adopt a despotism. There is noother alternative.’1 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en1] As developed by the men of theeighteenth century, equilibrium, or checks and balances, thus becomes the chiefmechanism by which both economic and political freedom were guaranteed and theabsence of tyranny insured among the sovereign nations of the world.Nowadays, the notion of an automatic political economy is best known to us assimply the practical conservatism of the anti-New Dealers of the ’thirties. Ithas been given new—although quite false—appeal by the frightening spectacle ofthe totalitarian states of Germany yesterday and Russia today. And although itis quite irrelevant to the political economy of modern America, it is the onlyrhetoric that prevails widely among the managerial elite of corporation andstate.1It is very difficult to give up the old model of power as an automatic balance,with its assumptions of a plurality of independent, relatively equal, andconflicting groups of the balancing society. All these assumptions are explicitto the point of unconscious caricature in recent statements of ‘who rulesAmerica.’ According to Mr. David Riesman, for example, during the past halfcentury there has been a shift from ‘the power hierarchy of a ruling class tothe power dispersal’ of ‘veto groups.’ Now no one runs anything: all isundirected drift. ‘In a sense,’ Mr. Riesman believes, ‘this is only another wayof saying that America is a middle-class country … in which, perhaps people willsoon wake up to the fact that there is no longer a “we” who run things and a“they” who don’t or a “we” who don’t run things and a “they” who do, but ratherthat all “we’s” are “they’s” and all “they’s” are “we’s.”’‘The chiefs have lost the power, but the followers have not gained it,’ and inthe meantime, Mr. Riesman takes his psychological interpretation of power and ofthe powerful to quite an extreme, for example: ‘if businessmen feel weak anddependent, they are weak and dependent, no matter what material resources may beascribed to them.’‘ … The future,’ accordingly, ‘seems to be in the hands of the small businessand professional men who control Congress: the local realtors, lawyers, carsalesmen, undertakers, and so on; of the military men who control defense and,in part, foreign policy; of the big business managers and their lawyers,finance-committee men, and other counselors who decide on plant investment andinfluence the rate of technological change; of the labor leaders who controlworker productivity and worker votes; of the black belt whites who have thegreatest stake in southern politics; of the Poles, Italians, Jews, and Irishmenwho have stakes in foreign policy, city jobs, and ethnic religious and culturalorganizations; of the editorializers and storytellers who help socialize theyoung, tease and train the adult, and amuse and annoy the aged; of thefarmers—themselves warring congeries of cattlemen, corn men, dairymen, cottonmen, and so on—who control key departments and committees and who, as the livingrepresentatives of our inner-directed past, control many of our memories; of theRussians and, to a lesser degree, other foreign powers who control much of ouragenda of attention; and so on. The reader can complete the list.’2[ch15_notes.html#ch11en2]Here indeed is something that measures up ‘to the modern standards of beingfully automatic and completely impersonal.’3 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en3] Yet thereis some reality in such romantic pluralism, even in such a pasticcio of power asMr. Riesman invents: it is a recognizable, although a confused, statement of themiddle levels of power, especially as revealed in Congressional districts and inthe Congress itself. But it confuses, indeed it does not even distinguishbetween the top, the middle, and the bottom levels of power. In fact, thestrategy of all such romantic pluralism, with its image of a semi-organizedstalemate, is rather clear:You elaborate the number of groups involved, in a kind of bewildering,Whitmanesque enthusiasm for variety. Indeed, what group fails to qualify as a‘veto group’? You do not try to clarify the hodge-podge by classifying thesegroups, occupations, strata, organizations according to their politicalrelevance or even according to whether they are organized politically at all.You do not try to see how they may be connected with one another into astructure of power, for by virtue of his perspective, the romantic conservativefocuses upon a scatter of milieux rather than upon their connections within astructure of power. And you do not consider the possibility of any community ofinterests among the top groups. You do not connect all these milieux andmiscellaneous groups with the big decisions: you do not ask and answer withhistorical detail: exactly what, directly or indirectly, did ‘small retailers’or ‘brick masons’ have to do with the sequence of decision and event that led toWorld War II? What did ‘insurance agents,’ or for that matter, the Congress,have to do with the decision to make or not to make, to drop or not to drop, theearly model of the new weapon? Moreover, you take seriously thepublic-relations-minded statements of the leaders of all groups, strata, andblocs, and thus confuse psychological uneasiness with the facts of power andpolicy. So long as power is not nakedly displayed, it must not be power. And ofcourse you do not consider the difficulties posed for you as an observer by thefact of secrecy, official and otherwise.In short, you allow your own confused perspective to confuse what you see and,as an observer as well as an interpreter, you are careful to remain on the mostconcrete levels of description you can manage, defining the real in terms of theexisting detail.The balance of power theory, as Irving Howe has noted, is a narrow-focus view ofAmerican politics.4 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en4] With it one can explain temporaryalliances within one party or the other. It is also narrow-focus in the choiceof time-span: the shorter the period of time in which you are interested, themore usable the balance of power theory appears. For when one is up-close anddealing journalistically with short periods, a given election, for example, oneis frequently overwhelmed by a multiplicity of forces and causes. One continualweakness of American ‘social science,’ since it became ever so empirical, hasbeen its assumption that a mere enumeration of a plurality of causes is the wiseand scientific way of going about understanding modern society. Of course it isnothing of the sort: it is a paste-pot eclecticism which avoids the real task ofsocial analysis: that task is to go beyond a mere enumeration of all the factsthat might conceivably be involved and weigh each of them in such a way as tounderstand how they fit together, how they form a model of what it is you aretrying to understand.5 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en5]Undue attention to the middle levels of power obscures the structure of power asa whole, especially the top and the bottom. American politics, as discussed andvoted and campaigned for, have largely to do with these middle levels, and oftenonly with them. Most ‘political’ news is news and gossip about middle-levelissues and conflicts. And in America, the political theorist too is often merelya more systematic student of elections, of who voted for whom. As a professor oras a free-lance intellectual, the political analyst is generally on the middlelevels of power himself. He knows the top only by gossip; the bottom, if at all,only by ‘research.’ But he is at home with the leaders of the middle level, and,as a talker himself, with their ‘bargaining.’Commentators and analysts, in and out of the universities, thus focus upon themiddle levels and their balances because they are closer to them, being mainlymiddle-class themselves; because these levels provide the noisy content of‘politics’ as an explicit and reported-upon fact; because such views are inaccord with the folklore of the formal model of how democracy works; andbecause, accepting that model as good, especially in their currentpatrioteering, many intellectuals are thus able most readily to satisfy suchpolitical urges as they may feel.When it is said that a ‘balance of power’ exists, it may be meant that no oneinterest can impose its will or its terms upon others; or that any one interestcan create a stalemate; or that in the course of time, first one and thenanother interest gets itself realized, in a kind of symmetrical taking of turns;or that all policies are the results of compromises, that no one wins all theywant to win, but each gets something. All these possible meanings are, in fact,attempts to describe what can happen when, permanently or temporarily, there issaid to be ‘equality of bargaining power.’ But, as Murray Edelman has pointedout,6 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en6] the goals for which interests struggle are notmerely given; they reflect the current state of expectation and acceptance.Accordingly, to say that various interests are ‘balanced’ is generally toevaluate the status quo as satisfactory or even good; the hopeful ideal ofbalance often masquerades as a description of fact.‘Balance of power’ implies equality of power, and equality of power seems whollyfair and even honorable, but in fact what is one man’s honorable balance isoften another’s unfair imbalance. Ascendant groups of course tend readily toproclaim a just balance of power and a true harmony of interest, for they prefertheir domination to be uninterrupted and peaceful. So large businessmen condemnsmall labor leaders as ‘disturbers of the peace’ and upsetters of the universalinterests inherent in business-labor cooperation. So privileged nations condemnweaker ones in the name of internationalism, defending with moral notions whathas been won by force against those have-nots whom, making their bid forascendancy or equality later, can hope to change the status quo only by force.7[ch15_notes.html#ch11en7]The notion that social change proceeds by a tolerant give and take, bycompromise and a network of vetoes of one interest balanced by another assumesthat all this goes on within a more or less stable framework that does notitself change, that all issues are subject to compromise, and are thus naturallyharmonious or can be made such. Those who profit by the general framework of thestatus quo can afford more easily than those who are dissatisfied under it toentertain such views as the mechanics of social change. Moreover, ‘in mostfields … only one interest is organized, none is, or some of the major ones arenot.’8 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en8] In these cases, to speak, as Mr. David Trumandoes, of ‘unorganized interests’9 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en9] is merely to useanother word for what used to be called ‘the public,’ a conception we shallpresently examine.* [page_247.html#pg247fn1a]The important ‘pressure groups,’ especially those of rural and urban business,have either been incorporated in the personnel and in the agencies of thegovernment itself, both legislative and executive, or become the instruments ofsmall and powerful cliques, which sometimes include their nominal leaders butoften do not. These facts go beyond the centralization of voluntary groups andthe usurpation of the power of apathetic members by professional executives.They involve, for example, the use of the NAM by dominant cliques to reveal tosmall-business members that their interests are identical with those of bigbusiness, and then to focus the power of business-as-a-whole into a politicalpressure. From the standpoint of such higher circles, the ‘voluntaryassociation,’ the ‘pressure group,’ becomes an important feature of apublic-relations program. The several corporations which are commanded by theindividual members of such cliques are themselves instruments of command, publicrelations, and pressure, but it is often more expedient to use the corporationsless openly, as bases of power, and to make of various national associationstheir joint operating branches. The associations are more operationalorganizations, whose limits of power are set by those who use them, than finalarbiters of action and inaction.10 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en10]Checks and balances may thus be understood as an alternative statement of‘divide and rule,’ and as a way of hampering the more direct expression ofpopular aspiration. For the theory of balance often rests upon the moral idea ofa natural harmony of interests, in terms of which greed and ruthlessness arereconciled with justice and progress. Once the basic structure of the Americanpolitical economy was built, and for so long as it could be tacitly supposedthat markets would expand indefinitely, the harmony of interest could and didserve well as the ideology of dominant groups, by making their interests appearidentical with the interests of the community as a whole. So long as thisdoctrine prevails, any lower group that begins to struggle can be made to appearinharmonious, disturbing the common interest. ‘The doctrine of the harmony ofinterests,’ E. H. Carr has remarked, ‘thus serves as an ingenious moral deviceinvoked, in perfect sincerity, by privileged groups in order to justify andmaintain their dominant position.’11 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en11]2The prime focus of the theory of balance is the Congress of the United States,and its leading actors are the Congressmen. Yet as social types, these 96Senators and 435 Representatives are not representative of the rank and filecitizens. They represent those who have been successful in entrepreneurial andprofessional endeavors. Older men, they are of the privileged white, native-bornof native parents, Protestant Americans. They are college graduates and they areat least solid, upper-middle class in income and status. On the average, theyhave had no experience of wage or lower salaried work. They are, in short, inand of the new and old upper classes of local society.*[page_248.html#pg248fn1a]Some members of the Congress are millionaires, others must scrounge thecountryside for expense money. The expenses of office are now quite heavy, oftenincluding the maintenance of two homes and traveling between them, the demandsof an often busy social life, and the greatly increased costs of getting electedand staying in office. An outside income is now almost indispensable for theCongressmen; and, in fact, four out of five of the Representatives and two outof three of the Senators in 1952 received incomes other than their Congressionalsalaries ‘from businesses or professions which they still maintain in their homecommunities, or from investments. Independently wealthy men are becomingincreasingly common on Capitol Hill … For those who are without private means …life as a member of Congress can border on desperation.’*[page_250.html#pg250fn1a] ‘If Federal law really meant what it seems to meanconcerning the uses of cash in election campaigns,’ Robert Bendiner has recentlyremarked, ‘more politicians would wind up in Leavenworth than in Washington.’17[ch15_notes.html#ch11en17]The political career does not attract as able a set of men as it once did. Froma money standpoint, the alert lawyer. who can readily make $25,000 to $50,000 ayear, is not very likely to trade it for the perils of the Congressman’sposition; and, no doubt with exceptions, if they are not wealthy men, it islikely that the candidates for Congress will be a county attorney, a localjudge, or a mayor—whose salaries are even less than those of Congressmen. Manyobservers, both in and out of Congress, agree that the Congress has fallen inpublic esteem over the last fifty years; and that, even in their home districtsand states, the Congressmen are by no means the important figures they oncewere.18 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en18] How many people, in fact, know the name oftheir Representative, or even of their Senators?Fifty years ago, in his district or state, the campaigning Congressman did nothave to compete in a world of synthetic celebrities with the mass means ofentertainment and distraction. The politician making a speech was looked to foran hour’s talk about what was going on in a larger world, and in debates he hadneither occasion nor opportunity to consult a ghost writer. He was, after all,one of the best-paid men in his locality and a big man there. But today, thepolitician must rely on the mass media, and access to these media isexpensive.** [page_250.html#pg250fn2a] The simple facts of the costs of themodern campaign clearly tie the Congressman, if he is not personally well-to-do,to the sources of needed contributions, which are, sensibly enough, usuallylooked upon as investments from which a return is expected.As free-lance law practitioners and as party politicians who must faceelections, the professional politicians have cultivated many different groupsand types of people in their localities. They are great ‘joiners’ of social andbusiness and fraternal organizations, belonging to Masons and Elks and theAmerican Legion. In their constituencies, the Congressmen deal with organizedgroups, and they are supported or approved according to their attitude towardthe interests and programs of these groups. It is in the local bailiwick thatthe plunder groups, who would exchange votes for favors, operate most openly.The politicians are surrounded by the demands and requests of such groups, largeand small, local and national. As brokers of power, the politicians mustcompromise one interest by another, and, in the process, they are themselvesoften compromised into men without any firm line of policy.Most professional politicians represent an astutely balanced variety of localinterests, and such rather small freedom to act in political decisions as theyhave derives from precisely that fact: if they are fortunate they can juggle andplay off these varied local interests against one another, but perhaps morefrequently they come to straddle the issues in order to avoid decision.Protecting the interests of his electoral domain, the Congressman remainsattentively loyal to his sovereign locality. In fact, his parochialism is insome cases so intense that as a local candidate he may even invite and collectfor local display an assortment of out-of-state attacks upon him, thus turninghis campaign into a crusade of the sovereign locality against nationaloutsiders.20 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en20]Inside the Congress, as in his constituency, the politician finds a tangle ofinterests; and he also finds that power is organized according to party andaccording to seniority. The power of the Congress is centered in the committee;the power of the committee is usually centered in its chairman, who becomeschairman by seniority. Accordingly, the politician’s chance to reach a positionof power within the Congress often rests upon his ability to stay in office fora long and uninterrupted period, and to do that, he cannot antagonize theimportant elements in his constituency. Flexible adjustment to these severalinterests and their programs, the agility to carry several, sometimesconflicting, lines of policy, but to look good doing it, is at a premium.Therefore, by a mechanical process of selection, mediocre party ‘regulars,’ whofor twenty years or more have been firmly anchored in their sovereignlocalities, are very likely to reach and to remain at the centers ofCongressional power.Even when the politician becomes a chairman—if possible, of a committeeaffecting the local interests of his district—he will not usually attempt toplay the role of the national statesman. For however enjoyable such attendantprestige may be, it is secondary to the achievement of local popularity; hisresponsibility is not to the nation; it is to the dominant interests of hislocality. Moreover, ‘better congressional machinery,’ as Stanley High hasremarked, ‘does not cure the evil of localism; indeed it may provide memberswith more time and better facilities for its practice.’21[ch15_notes.html#ch11en21]Nonetheless, the chairman of the major committees are the elite members of theCongress. In their hands rest the key powers of Congress, both legislative andinvestigative. They can originate, push, halt, or confuse legislation; they areadept at evasion and stall. They can block a White House proposal so that itnever reaches the floor for debate, let alone a vote. And they can tell thePresident what will and what will not gain the approval of the people in theirdistrict or of colleagues under their influence in Congress.In the first and second decades of this century, only a few bills were presentedduring the six months of the first session or the three months of the second.These bills were considered during the ample time between committee study andtheir debate on the floor. Debate was of importance and was carried on before asizable audience in the chamber. Legislation took up most of the member’s timeand attention. Today hundreds of bills are considered at each session; and sinceit would be impossible for members even to read them all—or a tenth of them—theyhave come to rely upon the committees who report the bills. There is littledebate and what there is often occurs before an emptied chamber. The speechesthat are made are mainly for the member’s locality, and many are not delivered,but merely inserted in the record. While legislation goes through the assemblyline, the Congressmen are busy in their offices, administering a small staffwhich runs errands for constituents and mails printed and typed matter tothem.22 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en22]In the campaigns of the professional politician, insistent national issues arenot usually faced up to, but local issues are raised in a wonderfully contrivedmanner. In the 472 Congressional elections of 1954, for example, no nationalissues were clearly presented, nor even local issues related clearly to them.*[page_253.html#pg253fn1a] Slogans and personal attacks on character, personalitydefects, and countercharges and suspicions were all that the electorate couldsee or hear, and, as usual, many paid no attention at all. Each candidate triedto dishonor his opponent, who in turn tried to dishonor him. The outragedcandidates seemed to make themselves the issue, and on that issue virtually allof them lost. The electorate saw no issues at all, and they too lost, althoughthey did not know it.24 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en24]As part of the grim trivialization of public life, the American politicalcampaign readily distracts attention from the possible debate of nationalpolicy. But one must not suppose that such noise is all that is involved. Thereare issues, in each district and state, issues set up and watched by organizedinterests of local importance. And that is the major implication to be drawnfrom the character of the campaigns:There are no national parties to which the professional politicians belong andwhich by their debate focus national issues clearly and responsibly andcontinuously.By definition, the professional politician is a party politician. And yet thetwo political parties in the United States are not nationally centralizedorganizations. As semi-feudal structures, they have operated by tradingpatronage and other favors for votes and protection. The lesser politiciantrades the votes that are in his domain for a larger share of the patronage andfavors. But there is no national ‘boss,’ much less a nationally responsibleleader of either of the parties. Each of them is a constellation of localorganizations curiously and intricately joined with various interest blocs. TheCongressman is generally independent of the Congressional leaders of his partyas far as campaign funds go. ‘The national committees of each major partyconsist mainly of political nonentities; for, since the parties are coalitionsof state and local organizations, each of them develops such national unity asit has only once every four years, for the Presidential election.25[ch15_notes.html#ch11en25] At the bottom and on the middle levels, the majorparties are strong, even dictatorial; but, at the top, they are very weak. It isonly the President and the Vice-President whose constituencies are national andwho, by their actions and appointments, provide such national party unity asprevails.The differences between the two parties, so far as national issues areconcerned, are very narrow and very mixed up. Each seems to be forty-eightparties, one to each state; and accordingly, the professional politician, asCongressman and as campaigner, is not concerned with national party lines, ifany are discernible. He is not subject to any effective national partydiscipline. He speaks solely for his own locality, and he is concerned withnational issues only in so far as they affect his locality, the interestseffectively organized there, and the chances of his re-election. That is themajor reason why, when he speaks of national matters, the political vocabularyof the politician is such an empty rhetoric. Seated in his sovereign locality,the professional politician is not at the summit of national, political power:he is on and of the middle levels.3More and more of the fundamental issues never come to any point of decisionbefore the Congress, or before its most powerful committees, much less beforethe electorate in campaigns. The entrance of the United States into World WarII, for example, in so far as it involved American decision, by-passed theCongress quite completely. It was never a clearly debated issue clearly focusedfor a public decision. Under the executive’s emergency power, the President, ina virtually dictatorial way, can make the decision for war, which is thenpresented to the Congress as a fact accomplished. ‘Executive agreements’ havethe force of treaties but need not be ratified by the Senate: the destroyer dealwith Great Britain and the commitment of troops to Europe under NATO, whichSenator Taft fought so bitterly, are clear examples of that fact. And in thecase of the Formosa decisions of the spring of 1955, the Congress simplyabdicated all debate concerning events and decisions bordering on war to theexecutive.When fundamental issues do come up for Congressional debate, they are likely tobe so structured as to limit consideration, and even to be stalemated ratherthan resolved. For with no responsible, centralized parties, it is difficult toform a majority in Congress; and—with the seniority system, the rules committee,the possibility of filibuster, and the lack of information and expertise—theCongress is all too likely to become a legislative labyrinth. It is no wonderthat firm Presidential initiative is often desired by Congress on non-localissues, and that, in what are defined as emergencies, powers are rather readilyhanded over to the executive, in order to break the semi-organized deadlock.Indeed, some observers believe that ‘congressional abdication and obstruction,not presidential usurpation, has been the main cause of the shift of power tothe Executive.’26 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en26]Among the professional politicians there are, of course, common denominators ofmood and interests, anchored in their quite homogeneous origins, careers, andassociations; and there is, of course, a common rhetoric in which their mindsare often trapped. In pursuing their several parochial interests, accordingly,the Congressmen often coincide in ways that are of national relevance. Suchinterests seldom become explicit issues. But the many little issues decided bylocal interest, and by bargain, by check and balance, have national results thatare often unanticipated by any one of the locally rooted agents involved. Lawsare thus sometimes made, as the stalemate is broken, behind the backs of thelawmakers involved. For Congress is the prime seat of the middle levels ofpower, and it is on these middle levels that checks and balances do oftenprevail.The truly vested interests are those openly pushed and protected by eachRepresentative and Senator. They are the parochial interests of the localsocieties of each Congressional district and state. In becoming vested in aSenator or a Representative they are compromised and balanced by other parochialinterests. The prime search of the Congressman is for the favor he can do forone interest that will not hurt any of the other interests he must balance.It is not necessary for ‘pressure groups’ to ‘corrupt’ politicians in Congress.In fact, lobbyists, in their discrete way, may at times appear as honest men,while Congressmen may appear as lobbyists in disguise. It is not necessary formembers of local society to pay off the professional politician in order to havetheir interests secured. For by social selection and by political training, heis of and by and for the key groups in his district and state.27[ch15_notes.html#ch11en27] The Congressmen are more the visible makers ofpressure inside the government than the subjects of invisible pressures from theperiphery. Fifty years ago, the old muckraker image of the Senator corrupted bymoney was often true,28 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en28] and money is of course stilla factor in politics. But the money that counts now is used mainly to financeelections rather than to pay off politicians directly for their votes andfavors.When we know that before entering politics one of the half dozen most powerfullegislators, and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, gained prominence bypromoting and organizing Chambers of Commerce in half a dozen middle-rankingcities of the nation, ‘without,’ as he says, ‘a cent of Federal aid,’ we canreadily understand why he fought extension of the excess-profits tax without anyreference to invisible, behind-the-scenes pressures brought to bear upon him.29[ch15_notes.html#ch11en29] Seventy-eight-year-old Daniel Reed is a man ofPuritan-like character and inflexible principle, but principles are derived fromand further strengthen character, and character is selected and formed by one’sentire career. Moreover, as one member of Congress recently remarked, ‘therecomes a time in the life of every Congressman when he must rise aboveprinciple.’30 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en30] As a political actor, the Congressmanis part of the compromised balances of local societies, as well as one or theother of the nationally irresponsible parties. As a result, he is caught in thesemi-organized stalemate of the middle levels of national power.Political power has become enlarged and made decisive, but not the power of theprofessional politician in the Congress. The considerable powers that do remainin the hands of key Congressmen are now shared with other types of politicalactors: There is the control of legislation, centered in the committee heads,but increasingly subject to decisive modification by the administrator. There isthe power to investigate, as a positive and a negative weapon, but itincreasingly involves intelligence agencies, both public and private, and itincreasingly becomes involved with what can only be called various degrees ofblackmail and counter-blackmail.In the absence of policy differences of consequences between the major parties,the professional party politician must invent themes about which to talk.Historically, this has involved the ordinary emptiness of ‘campaign rhetoric.’But since World War II, among frustrated politicians there has come into wideruse the accusation and the impugnment of character—of opponents as well as ofinnocent neutrals. This has, of course, rested upon the exploitation of the newhistorical fact that Americans now live in a military neighborhood; but it hasalso rested upon the place of the politician who practices a politics withoutreal issue, a middle-level politics for which the real decisions, even those ofpatronage, are made by higher ups. Hunting headlines in this context, with lesspatronage and without big engaging issues, some Congressmen find the way totemporary success, or at least to public attention, in the universalization ofdistrust.There is another way of gaining and of exercising power, one which involves theprofessional politician in the actions of cliques within and between thebureaucratic-like agencies of the administration. Increasingly, the professionalpolitician teams up with the administrator who heads an agency, a commission, ora department in order to exert power with him against other administrators andpoliticians, often in a cut-and-thrust manner. The traditional distinctionbetween ‘legislation’ as the making of policy and ‘administration’ as itsrealization has broken down from both sides.31 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en31]In so far as the politician enters into the continuous policy-making of themodern political state, he does so less by voting for or against a bill than byentering into a clique that is in a position to exert influence upon and throughthe command posts of the executive administration, or by not investigating areassensitive to certain clique interests.32 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en32] It is as amember of quite complicated cliques that the professional politician,representing a variety of interests, sometimes becomes quite relevant indesisions of national consequence.If governmental policy is the result of an interplay of group interests, we mustask: what interests outside the government are important and what agenciesinside it serve them? If there are many such interests and if they conflict withone another, then clearly each loses power and the agency involved either gainsa certain autonomy or is stalemated.33 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en33] In thelegislative branch, many and competing interests, especially local ones, come tofocus, often in a stalemate. Other interests, on the level of national corporatepower, never come to a focus but the Congressman, by virtue of what he is as apolitical and social creature, realizes them. But in the executive agency anumber of small and coherent interests are often the only ones at play, andoften they are able to install themselves within the agency or effectivelynullify its action against themselves. Thus regulatory agencies, as John KennethGalbraith has remarked, ‘become, with some exceptions, either an arm of theindustry they are regulating or servile.’34 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en34] Theexecutive ascendancy, moreover, has either relegated legislative action—andinaction—to a subordinate role in the making of policy or bends it to theexecutive will. For enforcement’ now clearly involves the making of policy, andeven legislation itself is often written by members of the executive branch.In the course of American history, there have been several oscillations betweenPresidential and Congressional leadership.35 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en35]Congressional supremacy, for example, was quite plain during the last third ofthe nineteenth century. But in the middle third of the twentieth century, withwhich we are concerned, the power of the Executive, and the increased means ofpower at its disposal, is far greater than at any previous period, and there areno signs of its power diminishing. The executive supremacy means the relegationof the legislature to the middle levels of political power; it means the declineof the professional politician, for the major locale of the party politician isthe legislature. It is also a prime indicator of the decline of the oldbalancing society. For—in so far as the old balance was not entirelyautomatic—it was the politician, as a specialist in balance and a broker ofcontending pressures, who adjusted the balances, reached compromises, andmaintained the grand equilibrium. That politician who best satisfied or held offa variety of interests could best gain power and hold it. But now theprofessional politician of the old balancing society has been relegated to aposition ‘among those also present,’ often noisy, or troublesome, or helpful tothe ascendant outsiders, but not holding the keys to decision. For the oldbalancing society in which he flourished no longer prevails.36[ch15_notes.html#ch11en36]4Back of the theory of checks and balances as the mode of political decisionthere is the class theory, well-known since Aristotle and held in firm view bythe eighteenth-century Founding Fathers, that the state is, or ought to be, asystem of checks and balances because the society is a balance of classes, andthat society is a balance of classes because its pivot and its stabilizer is thestrong and independent middle class.Nineteenth-century America was a middle-class society, in which numerous smalland relatively equally empowered organizations flourished. Within this balancingsociety there was an economy in which the small entrepreneur was central, apolicy in which a formal division of authority was an operative fact, and apolitical economy in which political and economic orders were quite autonomous.If at times it was not a world of small entrepreneurs, at least it was always aworld in which small entrepreneurs had a real part to play in the equilibrium ofpower. But the society in which we now live consists of an economy in which thesmall entrepreneurs have been replaced in key areas by a handful of centralizedcorporations, of a polity in which the division of authority has becomeimbalanced in such a way that the executive branch is supreme, the legislativerelegated to the middle levels of power, and the judiciary, with due time-lag,to the drift of policy which it does not initiate; and finally, the new societyis clearly a political economy in which political and economic affairs areintricately and deeply joined together.37 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en37]The romantic pluralism of the Jeffersonian ideal prevailed in a society in whichperhaps four-fifths of the free, white population were in one sense or another,independent proprietors. But in the epoch following the Civil War, that oldmiddle class of independent proprietors began to decline, as, in one industryafter another, larger and more concentrated economic units came into ascendancy;and in the later part of the progressive era, the independent middle class offarmers and small businessmen fought politically—and lost their last real chancefor a decisive role in the political balance.38 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en38]Already appeals to them, as by David Graham Phillips, were nostalgicdeifications of their imagined past, which they seemed to hope would dispel theworld of twentieth-century reality.39 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en39] Such sentimentsflared up briefly again in the La Follette campaign of 1924, and they were oneof the sources of the New Deal’s rhetorical strength. But two facts about themiddle classes and one fact about labor—which became politically importantduring the ‘thirties—have become decisive during our own time:I. The independent middle class became politically, as well as economically,dependent upon the machinery of the state. It is widely felt, for example, thatthe most successful ‘lobby’ in the United States is The Farm Bloc; in fact, ithas been so successful that it is difficult to see it as an independent forceacting upon the several organs of government. It has become meshed firmly withthese organs, especially with the Senate, in which, due to the peculiargeographic principle of representation, it is definitively over-represented.Ideologically, due to the exploitation of Jeffersonian myths about farming as away of life, large commercial farmers as members of an industry are accepted asof that national interest which ought to be served by very special policies,rather than as one special interest among others. This special policy is thepolicy of parity, which holds that the government ought to guarantee to this onesector of the free enterprise system a price level for its products that willenable commercial farmers to enjoy a purchasing power equivalent to the power itpossessed in its most prosperous period just prior to World War I. In everysense of the word, this is of course ‘class legislation,’ but it is‘middle-class legislation,’ and it is so wonderfully entrenched as politicalfact that in the realm of crackpot realism in which such ideas thrive, it isthought of as merely sound public policy.Well-to-do farmers, who are the chief rural beneficiaries of the subsidizedenterprise system, are businessmen and so think of themselves. The hayseed andthe rebel of the ’nineties have been replaced by the rural businessmen of the’fifties. The political hold of the farmer is still strong but, as a demand uponthe political top, it is more worrisome than decisive. The farmers, it is true,are taken into account so far as their own special interests are concerned, butthese do not include the major issues of peace and war that confront the bigpolitical outsiders today, and the issues of slump and boom, to which the farmeris quite relevant, are not now foremost in the political outsiders’ attention.II. Alongside the old independent middle class, there had arisen inside thecorporate society a new dependent middle class of white-collar employees.Roughly, in the last two generations, as proportions of the middle classes as awhole, the old middle class has declined from 85 to 44 per cent; the new middleclass has risen from 15 to 56 per cent. For many reasons, which I have elsewheretried to make clear—this class is less the political pivot of a balancingsociety than a rear-guard of the dominant drift towards a mass society.40[ch15_notes.html#ch11en40] Unlike the farmer and the small businessman—andunlike the wage worker—the white-collar employee was born too late to have hadeven a brief day of autonomy. The occupational positions and status trends whichform the white-collar outlook make of the salaried employees a rear-guard ratherthan a vanguard of historic change. They are in no political way united orcoherent. Their unionization, such as it is, is a unionization into the maindrift and decline of labor organization, and serves to incorporate them ashangers-on of the newest interest trying, unsuccessfully, to invest itself inthe state.The old middle class for a time acted as an independent base of power; the newmiddle class cannot. Political freedom and economic security were anchored inthe fact of small-scale and independent properties; they are not anchored in thejob world of the new middle class. Scattered properties, and their holders, wereintegrated economically by free and autonomous markets; the jobs of the newmiddle class are integrated by corporate authority. The white-collar middleclasses do not form an independent base of power: economically, they are in thesame situation as property-less wage workers; politically they are in a worsecondition, for they are not as organized.III. Alongside the old middle class—increasingly invested within the statemachinery—and the new middle class—born without independent political shape anddeveloped in such a way as never to achieve it—a new political force came intothe political arena of the ’thirties: the force of organized labor. For a brieftime, it seemed that labor would become a power-bloc independent of corporationand state but operating upon and against them. After becoming dependent upon thegovernmental system, however, the labor unions suffered rapid decline in powerand now have little part in major national decisions. The United States now hasno labor leaders who carry any weight of consequence in decisions of importanceto the political outsiders now in charge of the visible government.Viewed from one special angle, the labor unions have become organizations thatselect and form leaders who, upon becoming successful, take their placesalongside corporate executives in and out of government, and alongsidepoliticians in both major parties, among the national power elite. For onefunction of labor unions-like social movements and political parties—is toattempt to contribute to the formation of this directorate. As new men of power,the labor leaders have come only lately to the national arena. Samuel Gomperswas perhaps the first labor man to become, even though temporarily and quiteuneasily, a member of the national power elite. His self-conscious attempt toestablish his place within this elite, and thus to secure the labor interest asintegral with national interests, has made him a prototype and model for thenational labor career. Sidney Hillman was not, of course, the only labor man totake up this course during the ’forties, but his lead during the early waryears, his awareness of himself as a member of the national elite, and the realand imagined recognition he achieved as a member (‘Clear it with Sidney’),signaled the larger entrance—after the great expansion of the unions during theNew Deal—of labor leaders into the political elite. With the advent of Truman’sFair Deal and Eisenhower’s Great Crusade, no labor leader can readily entertainserious notions of becoming, formally or informally, a member. The early exit ofa minor labor man—Durkin—from his weak cabinet post revealed rather clearly thesituation faced by labor leaders as would-be members as well as the position oflabor unions as a power bloc. Well below the top councils, they are of themiddle levels of power.Much of the often curious behavior and maneuvers of the labor chieftains overthe last two decades is explainable by their search for status within thenational power elite. In this context they have displayed extreme sensibility toprestige slights. They feel that they have arrived; they want the statusaccoutrements of power. In middle and small-sized cities, labor leaders now sitwith Chamber of Commerce officials on civic enterprises; and on the nationallevel, they expect and they get places in production boards and price-controlagencies.Their claim for status and power rests on their already increased power—not onproperty, income, or birth; and power in such situations as theirs is a sourceof uneasiness as well as a base of operations. It is not yet a solidly bottomed,continuous base having the force of use and wont and law. Their touchiness aboutprestige matters, especially on the national scene, has been due to (1) theirself-made character, and to the fact (2) that their self-making was helped noend by government and the atmosphere it created in the decade after 1935. Theyare government-made men, and they have feared—correctly, it turns out—that theycan be unmade by government. Their status tension is also due to the fact (3)that they are simply new to the power elite and its ways, and (4) that they feela tension between their publics: their union members—before whom it ispolitically dangerous to be too big a ‘big shot’ or too closely associated withinherited enemies—and their newly found companions and routines of life.Many observers mistake the status accoutrements of labor leaders for evidence oflabor’s power. In a way they are, but in a way they are not. They are when theyare based on and lead to power. They are not when they become status traps forleaders without resulting in power. In such matters, it is well to remember thatthis is no chicken-and-egg issue. The chicken is power, and comes first, the eggis status.* [page_264.html#pg264fn1a]During the ’thirties organized labor was emerging for the first time on anAmerican scale; it had little need of any political sense of direction otherthan the slogan, ‘organize the unorganized.’ This is no longer the case, butlabor—without the mandate of the slump—still remains without political, or forthat matter economic, direction. Like small business, its leaders have tried tofollow the way of the farmer. Once this farmer was a source of insurgency; inthe recent past, labor has seemed to be such. Now the large farmer is a unit inan organized bloc, entrenched within and pressuring the welfare state. Despiteits greater objective antagonism to capitalism as a wage system, labor nowstruggles, unsuccessfully, to go the same way.5In the old liberal society, a set of balances and compromises prevailed amongCongressional leaders, the executive branch of the government, and variouspressure groups. The image of power and of decision is the image of a balancingsociety in which no unit of power is powerful enough to do more than edgeforward a bit at a time, in compromised countervailance with other such forces,and in which, accordingly, there is no unity, much less coordination, among thehigher circles. Some such image, combined with the doctrine of public opinion,is still the official view of the formal democratic system of power, thestandard theory of most academic social scientists, and the underlyingassumption of most literate citizens who are neither political spokesmen norpolitical analysts.But as historical conditions change, so do the meanings and politicalconsequences of the mechanics of power. There is nothing magical or eternalabout checks and balances. In time of revolution, checks and balances may besignificant as a restraint upon unorganized and organized masses. In time ofrigid dictatorship, they may be significant as a technique of divide and rule.Only under a state which is already quite well balanced, and which has under ita balanced social structure, do checks and balances mean a restraint upon therulers.The eighteenth-century political theorists had in mind as the unit of power theindividual citizen, and the classic economists had in mind the small firmoperated by an individual. Since their time, the units of power, the relationsbetween the units, and hence the meaning of the checks and balances, havechanged. In so far as there is now a great scatter of relatively equal balancingunits, it is on the middle levels of power, seated in the sovereign localitiesand intermittent pressure groups, and coming to its high point within theCongress. We must thus revise and relocate the received conception of anenormous scatter of varied interests, for, when we look closer and for longerperiods of time, we find that most of these middle-level interests are concernedmerely with their particular cut, with their particular area of vested interest,and often these are of no decisive political importance, although many are ofenormous detrimental value to welfare. Above this plurality of interests, theunits of power—economic, political, and military—that count in any balance arefew in number and weighty beyond comparison with the dispersed groups on themiddle and lower levels of the power structure.Those who still hold that the power system reflects the balancing society oftenconfuse the present era with earlier times of American history, and confuse thetop and the bottom levels of the present system with its middle levels. When itis generalized into a master model of the power system, the theory of balancebecomes historically unspecific; whereas in fact, as a model, it should bespecified as applicable only to certain phases of United Statesdevelopment—notably the Jacksonian period and, under quite differingcircumstances, the early and middle New Deal.The idea that the power system is a balancing society also assumes that theunits in balance are independent of one another, for if business and labor orbusiness and government, for example, are not independent of one another, theycannot be seen as elements of a free and open balance. But as we have seen, themajor vested interests often compete less with one another in their effort topromote their several interests than they coincide on many points of interestand, indeed, come together under the umbrella of government. The units ofeconomic and political power not only become larger and more centralized; theycome to coincide in interest and to make explicit as well as tacit alliances.The American government today is not merely a framework within which contendingpressures jockey for position and make politics. Although there is of coursesome of that, this government now has such interests vested within its ownhierarchical structure, and some of these are higher and more ascendant thanothers. There is no effective countervailing power against the coalition of thebig businessmen—who, as political outsiders, now occupy the command posts—andthe ascendant military men—who with such grave voices now speak so frequently inthe higher councils. Those having real power in the American state today are notmerely brokers of power, resolvers of conflict, or compromisers of varied andclashing interest—they represent and indeed embody quite specific nationalinterests and policies.While the professional party politicians may still, at times, be brokers ofpower, compromisers of interests, negotiators of issues, they are no longer atthe top of the state, or at the top of the power system as a whole.The idea that the power system is a balancing society leads us to assume thatthe state is a visible mask for autonomous powers, but in fact, the powers ofdecision are now firmly vested within the state. The old lobby, visible orinvisible, is now the visible government. This ‘governmentalization of thelobby’ has proceeded in both the legislative and the executive domains, as wellas between them. The executive bureaucracy becomes not only the center of powerbut also the arena within which and in terms of which all conflicts of power areresolved or denied resolution. Administration replaces electoral politics; themaneuvering of cliques replaces the clash of parties.The agrarian revolt of the ’nineties, the small-business revolt that has beenmore or less intermittent since the ’eighties, the labor revolt of the’thirties—all of these have failed and all of these have succeeded. They havefailed as autonomous movements of small property or of organized workmen whichcould countervail against the power of the corporate rich, and they have failedas politically autonomous third parties. But they have succeeded, in varyingdegrees, as vested interests inside the expanded state, and they have succeededas parochial interests variously seated in particular districts and states wherethey do not conflict with larger interests. They are well-established featuresof the middle levels of balancing power.Among the plurality of these middle powers, in fact, are all those strata andinterests which in the course of American history have been defeated in theirbids for top power or which have never made such bids. They include: rural smallproperty, urban small property, the wage-worker unions, all consumers, and allmajor white-collar groups. These are indeed still in an unromantic scatter;being structurally unable to unite among themselves, they do indeed balance oneanother—in a system of semi-organized stalemate. They ‘get in the way’ of theunified top, but no one of them has a chance to come into the top circles, wherethe political outsiders from corporate institution and military order are firmlyin command.When the multifarious middle classes are a political balance wheel, theprofessional politician is the ascendant decision-maker. When the middle classesdecline as a set of autonomous political forces, the balancing society as asystem of power declines, and the party politicians of the sovereign localitiesare relegated to the middle levels of national power.These structural trends came to political shape during the period of the NewDeal, which was of course a time of slump. That our own immediate period hasbeen a time of material prosperity has obscured these facts, but it has notaltered them; and, as facts, they are important to the understanding of thepower elite today."},{"pageContent":"12THE POWER ELITEEXCEPT for the unsuccessful Civil War, changes in the power system of the UnitedStates have not involved important challenges to its basic legitimations. Evenwhen they have been decisive enough to be called ‘revolutions,’ they have notinvolved the ‘resort to the guns of a cruiser, the dispersal of an electedassembly by bayonets, or the mechanisms of a police state.’1[ch15_notes.html#ch12en1] Nor have they involved, in any decisive way, anyideological struggle to control masses. Changes in the American structure ofpower have generally come about by institutional shifts in the relativepositions of the political, the economic, and the military orders. From thispoint of view, and broadly speaking, the American power elite has gone throughfour epochs, and is now well into a fifth.1I. During the first—roughly from the Revolution through the administration ofJohn Adams—the social and economic, the political and the military institutionswere more or less unified in a simple and direct way: the individual men ofthese several elites moved easily from one role to another at the top of each ofthe major institutional orders. Many of them were many-sided men who could takethe part of legislator and merchant, frontiersman and soldier, scholar andsurveyor.2 [ch15_notes.html#ch12en2]Until the downfall of the Congressional caucus of 1824, political institutionsseemed quite central; political decisions, of great importance; manypoliticians, considered national statesmen of note. ‘Society, as I firstremember it,’ Henry Cabot Lodge once said, speaking of the Boston of his earlyboyhood, ‘was based on the old families; Doctor Holmes defines them in the“Autocrat” as the families which had held high position in the colony, theprovince and during the Revolution and the early decades of the United States.They represented several generations of education and standing in the community… They had ancestors who had filled the pulpits, sat upon the bench, and takenpart in the government under the crown; who had fought in the Revolution, helpedto make the State and National constitutions and served in the army or navy; whohad been members of the House or Senate in the early days of the Republic, andwho had won success as merchants, manufacturers, lawyers, or men of letters.’3[ch15_notes.html#ch12en3]Such men of affairs, who—as I have noted—were the backbone of Mrs. John Jay’ssocial list of 1787, definitely included political figures of note. Theimportant fact about these early days is that social life, economicinstitutions, military establishment, and political order coincided, and men whowere high politicians also played key roles in the economy and, with theirfamilies, were among those of the reputable who made up local society. In fact,this first period is marked by the leadership of men whose status does not restexclusively upon their political position, although their political activitiesare important and the prestige of politicians high. And this prestige seemsattached to the men who occupy Congressional position as well as the cabinet.The elite are political men of education and of administrative experience, and,as Lord Bryce noted, possess a certain ‘largeness of view and dignity ofcharacter.’4 [ch15_notes.html#ch12en4]II. During the early nineteenth century—which followed Jefferson’s politicalphilosophy, but, in due course, Hamilton’s economic principles—the economic andpolitical and military orders fitted loosely into the great scatter of theAmerican social structure. The broadening of the economic order which came to beseated in the individual property owner was dramatized by Jefferson’s purchaseof the Louisiana Territory and by the formation of the Democratic-Republicanparty as successor to the Federalists.In this society, the ‘elite’ became a plurality of top groups, each in turnquite loosely made up. They overlapped to be sure, but again quite loosely so.One definite key to the period, and certainly to our images of it, is the factthat the Jacksonian Revolution was much more of a status revolution than eitheran economic or a political one. The metropolitan 400 could not truly flourish inthe face of the status tides of Jacksonian democracy; alongside it was apolitical elite in charge of the new party system. No set of men controlledcentralized means of power; no small clique dominated economic, much lesspolitical, affairs. The economic order was ascendant over both social status andpolitical power; within the economic order, a quite sizable proportion of allthe economic men were among those who decided. For this was the period—roughlyfrom Jefferson to Lincoln—when the elite was at most a loose coalition. Theperiod ended, of course, with the decisive split of southern and northern types.Official commentators like to contrast the ascendancy in totalitarian countriesof a tightly organized clique with the American system of power. Such comments,however, are easier to sustain if one compares mid-twentieth-century Russia withmid-nineteenth-century America, which is what is often done byTocqueville-quoting Americans making the contrast. But that was an America of acentury ago, and in the century that has passed, the American elite have notremained as patrioteer essayists have described them to us. The ‘loose cliques’now head institutions of a scale and power not then existing and, especiallysince World War I, the loose cliques have tightened up. We are well beyond theera of romantic pluralism.III. The supremacy of corporate economic power began, in a formal way, with theCongressional elections of 1866, and was consolidated by the Supreme Courtdecision of 1886 which declared that the Fourteenth Amendment protected thecorporation. That period witnessed the transfer of the center of initiative fromgovernment to corporation. Until the First World War (which gave us an advancedshowing of certain features of our own period) this was an age of raids on thegovernment by the economic elite, an age of simple corruption, when Senators andjudges were simply bought up. Here, once upon a time, in the era of McKinley andMorgan, far removed from the undocumented complexities of our own time, many nowbelieve, was the golden era of the American ruling class.5[ch15_notes.html#ch12en5]The military order of this period, as in the second, was subordinate to thepolitical, which in turn was subordinate to the economic. The military was thusoff to the side of the main driving forces of United States history. Politicalinstitutions in the United States have never formed a centralized and autonomousdomain of power; they have been enlarged and centralized only reluctantly inslow response to the public consequence of the corporate economy.In the post-Civil-War era, that economy was the dynamic; the ‘trusts’—aspolicies and events make amply clear—could readily use the relatively weakgovernmental apparatus for their own ends. That both state and federalgovernments were decisively limited in their power to regulate, in fact meantthat they were themselves regulatable by the larger moneyed interests. Theirpowers were scattered and unorganized; the powers of the industrial andfinancial corporations concentrated and interlocked. The Morgan interests aloneheld 341 directorships in 112 corporations with an aggregate capitalization ofover $22 billion—over three times the assessed value of all real and personalproperty in New England.6 [ch15_notes.html#ch12en6] With revenues greater andemployees more numerous than those of many states, corporations controlledparties, bought laws, and kept Congressmen of the ‘neutral’ state. And asprivate economic power overshadowed public political power, so the economicelite overshadowed the political.Yet even between 1896 and 1919, events of importance tended to assume apolitical form, foreshadowing the shape of power which after the partial boom ofthe ’twenties was to prevail in the New Deal. Perhaps there has never been anyperiod in American history so politically transparent as the Progressive era ofPresident-makers and Muckrakers.IV. The New Deal did not reverse the political and economic relations of thethird era, but it did create within the political arena, as well as in thecorporate world itself, competing centers of power that challenged those of thecorporate directors. As the New Deal directorate gained political power, theeconomic elite, which in the third period had fought against the growth of‘government’ while raiding it for crafty privileges, belatedly attempted to joinit on the higher levels. When they did so they found themselves confrontingother interests and men, for the places of decision were crowded. In due course,they did come to control and to use for their own purposes the New Dealinstitutions whose creation they had so bitterly denounced.But during the ’thirties, the political order was still an instrument of smallpropertied farmers and businessmen, although they were weakened, having losttheir last chance for real ascendancy in the Progressive era. The strugglebetween big and small property flared up again, however, in the political realmof the New Deal era, and to this struggle there was added, as we have seen, thenew struggle of organized labor and the unorganized unemployed. This new forceflourished under political tutelage, but nevertheless, for the first time inUnited States history, social legislation and lower-class issues becameimportant features of the reform movement.In the decade of the ’thirties, a set of shifting balances involving newlyinstituted farm measures and newly organized labor unions—along with bigbusiness—made up the political and administrative drama of power. These farm,labor, and business groups, moreover, were more or less contained within theframework of an enlarging governmental structure, whose political directorshipmade decisions in a definitely political manner. These groups pressured, and inpressuring against one another and against the governmental and party system,they helped to shape it. But it could not be said that any of them for anyconsiderable length of time used that government unilaterally as theirinstrument. That is why the ’thirties was a political decade: the power ofbusiness was not replaced, but it was contested and supplemented: it became onemajor power within a structure of power that was chiefly run by political men,and not by economic or military men turned political.The earlier and middle Roosevelt administrations can best be understood as adesperate search for ways and means, within the existing capitalist system, ofreducing the staggering and ominous army of the unemployed. In these years, theNew Deal as a system of power was essentially a balance of pressure groups andinterest blocs. The political top adjusted many conflicts, gave way to thisdemand, sidetracked that one, was the unilateral servant of none, and so evenedit all out into such going policy line as prevailed from one minor crisis toanother. Policies were the result of a political act of balance at the top. Ofcourse, the balancing act that Roosevelt performed did not affect thefundamental institutions of capitalism as a type of economy. By his policies, hesubsidized the defaults of the capitalist economy, which had simply broken down;and by his rhetoric, he balanced its political disgrace, putting ‘economicroyalists’ in the political doghouse.The ‘welfare state,’ created to sustain the balance and to carry out thesubsidy, differed from the ‘laissez-faire’ state: ‘If the state was believedneutral in the days of T.R. because its leaders claimed to sanction favors forno one,’ Richard Hofstadter has remarked, ‘the state under F.D.R. could becalled neutral only in the sense that it offered favors to everyone.’7[ch15_notes.html#ch12en7] The new state of the corporate commissars differs fromthe old welfare state. In fact, the later Roosevelt years—beginning with theentrance of the United States into overt acts of war and preparations for WorldWar II—cannot be understood entirely in terms of an adroit equipoise ofpolitical power.2We study history, it has been said, to rid ourselves of it, and the history ofthe power elite is a clear case for which this maxim is correct. Like the tempoof American life in general, the long-term trends of the power structure*[page_274.html#pg274fn1a] have been greatly speeded up since World War II, andcertain newer trends within and between the dominant institutions have also setthe shape of the power elite and given historically specific meaning to itsfifth epoch:I. In so far as the structural clue to the power elite today lies in thepolitical order, that clue is the decline of politics as genuine and publicdebate of alternative decisions—with nationally responsible and policy-coherentparties and with autonomous organizations connecting the lower and middle levelsof power with the top levels of decision. America is now in considerable partmore a formal political democracy than a democratic social structure, and eventhe formal political mechanics are weak.The long-time tendency of business and government to become more intricately anddeeply involved with each other has, in the fifth epoch, reached a new point ofexplicitness. The two cannot now be seen clearly as two distinct worlds. It isin terms of the executive agencies of the state that the rapprochement hasproceeded most decisively. The growth of the executive branch of the government,with its agencies that patrol the complex economy, does not mean merely the‘enlargement of government’ as some sort of autonomous bureaucracy: it has meantthe ascendancy of the corporation’s man as a political eminence.During the New Deal the corporate chieftains joined the political directorate;as of World War II they have come to dominate it. Long interlocked withgovernment, now they have moved into quite full direction of the economy of thewar effort and of the postwar era. This shift of the corporation executives intothe political directorate has accelerated the long-term relegation of theprofessional politicians in the Congress to the middle levels of power.II. In so far as the structural clue to the power elite today lies in theenlarged and military state, that clue becomes evident in the militaryascendancy. The warlords have gained decisive political relevance, and themilitary structure of America is now in considerable part a political structure.The seemingly permanent military threat places a premium on the military andupon their control of men, materiel, money, and power; virtually all politicaland economic actions are now judged in terms of military definitions of reality:the higher warlords have ascended to a firm position within the power elite ofthe fifth epoch.In part at least this has resulted from one simple historical fact, pivotal forthe years since 1939: the focus of elite attention has been shifted fromdomestic problems, centered in the ’thirties around slump, to internationalproblems, centered in the ’forties and ’fifties around war. Since the governingapparatus of the United States has by long historic usage been adapted to andshaped by domestic clash and balance, it has not, from any angle, had suitableagencies and traditions for the handling of international problems. Such formaldemocratic mechanics as had arisen in the century and a half of nationaldevelopment prior to 1941, had not been extended to the American handling ofinternational affairs. It is, in considerable part, in this vacuum that thepower elite has grown.III. In so far as the structural clue to the power elite today lies in theeconomic order, that clue is the fact that the economy is at once apermanent-war economy and a private-corporation economy. American capitalism isnow in considerable part a military capitalism, and the most important relationof the big corporation to the state rests on the coincidence of interestsbetween military and corporate needs, as defined by warlords and corporate rich.Within the elite as a whole, this coincidence of interest between the highmilitary and the corporate chieftains strengthens both of them and furthersubordinates the role of the merely political men. Not politicians, butcorporate executives, sit with the military and plan the organization of wareffort.The shape and meaning of the power elite today can be understood only when thesethree sets of structural trends are seen at their point of coincidence: themilitary capitalism of private corporations exists in a weakened and formaldemocratic system containing a military order already quite political in outlookand demeanor. Accordingly, at the top of this structure, the power elite hasbeen shaped by the coincidence of interest between those who control the majormeans of production and those who control the newly enlarged means of violence;from the decline of the professional politician and the rise to explicitpolitical command of the corporate chieftains and the professional warlords;from the absence of any genuine civil service of skill and integrity,independent of vested interests.The power elite is composed of political, economic, and military men, but thisinstituted elite is frequently in some tension: it comes together only oncertain coinciding points and only on certain occasions of ‘crisis.’ In the longpeace of the nineteenth century, the military were not in the high councils ofstate, not of the political directorate, and neither were the economic men—theymade raids upon the state but they did not join its directorate. During the‘thirties, the political man was ascendant. Now the military and the corporatemen are in top positions.Of the three types of circle that compose the power elite today, it is themilitary that has benefited the most in its enhanced power, although thecorporate circles have also become more explicitly intrenched in the more publicdecision-making circles. It is the professional politician that has lost themost, so much that in examining the events and decisions, one is tempted tospeak of a political vacuum in which the corporate rich and the high warlord, intheir coinciding interests, rule.It should not be said that the three ‘take turns’ in carrying the initiative,for the mechanics of the power elite are not often as deliberate as that wouldimply. At times, of course, it is—as when political men, thinking they canborrow the prestige of generals, find that they must pay for it, or, as whenduring big slumps, economic men feel the need of a politician at once safe andpossessing vote appeal. Today all three are involved in virtually all widelyramifying decisions. Which of the three types seems to lead depends upon ‘thetasks of the period’ as they, the elite, define them. Just now, these taskscenter upon ‘defense’ and international affairs. Accordingly, as we have seen,the military are ascendant in two senses: as personnel and as justifyingideology. That is why, just now, we can most easily specify the unity and theshape of the power elite in terms of the military ascendancy.But we must always be historically specific and open to complexities. The simpleMarxian view makes the big economic man the real holder of power; the simpleliberal view makes the big political man the chief of the power system; andthere are some who would view the warlords as virtual dictators. Each of theseis an oversimplified view. It is to avoid them that we use the term ‘powerelite’ rather than, for example, ‘ruling class.’* [page_277.html#pg277fn1a]In so far as the power elite has come to wide public attention, it has done soin terms of the ‘military clique.’ The power elite does, in fact, take itscurrent shape from the decisive entrance into it of the military. Their presenceand their ideology are its major legitimations, whenever the power elite feelsthe need to provide any. But what is called the Washington military clique’ isnot composed merely of military men, and it does not prevail merely inWashington. Its members exist all over the country, and it is a coalition ofgenerals in the roles of corporation executives, of politicians masquerading asadmirals, of corporation executives acting like politicians, of civil servantswho become majors, of vice-admirals who are also the assistants to a cabinetofficer, who is himself, by the way, really a member of the managerial elite.Neither the idea of a ‘ruling class’ nor of a simple monolithic rise of‘bureaucratic politicians’ nor of a ‘military clique’ is adequate. The powerelite today involves the often uneasy coincidence of economic, military, andpolitical power.3Even if our understanding were limited to these structural trends, we shouldhave grounds for believing the power elite a useful, indeed indispensable,concept for the interpretation of what is going on at the topside of modernAmerican society. But we are not, of course, so limited: our conception of thepower elite does not need to rest only upon the correspondence of theinstitutional hierarchies involved, or upon the many points at which theirshifting interests coincide. The power elite, as we conceive it, also rests uponthe similarity of its personnel, and their personal and official relations withone another, upon their social and psychological affinities. In order to graspthe personal and social basis of the power elite’s unity, we have first toremind ourselves of the facts of origin, career, and style of life of each ofthe types of circle whose members compose the power elite.The power elite is not an aristocracy, which is to say that it is not apolitical ruling group based upon a nobility of hereditary origin. It has nocompact basis in a small circle of great families whose members can and doconsistently occupy the top positions in the several higher circles whichoverlap as the power elite. But such nobility is only one possible basis ofcommon origin. That it does not exist for the American elite does not mean thatmembers of this elite derive socially from the full range of strata composingAmerican society. They derive in substantial proportions from the upper classes,both new and old, of local society and the metropolitan 400. The bulk of thevery rich, the corporate executives, the political outsiders, the high military,derive from, at most, the upper third of the income and occupational pyramids.Their fathers were at least of the professional and business strata, and veryfrequently higher than that. They are native-born Americans of native parents,primarily from urban areas, and, with the exceptions of the politicians amongthem, overwhelmingly from the East. They are mainly Protestants, especiallyEpiscopalian or Presbyterian. In general, the higher the position, the greaterthe proportion of men within it who have derived from and who maintainconnections with the upper classes. The generally similar origins of the membersof the power elite are underlined and carried further by the fact of theirincreasingly common educational routine. Overwhelmingly college graduates,substantial proportions have attended Ivy League colleges, although theeducation of the higher military, of course, differs from that of other membersof the power elite.But what do these apparently simple facts about the social composition of thehigher circles really mean? In particular, what do they mean for any attempt tounderstand the degree of unity, and the direction of policy and interest thatmay prevail among these several circles? Perhaps it is best to put this questionin a deceptively simple way: in terms of origin and career, who or what do thesemen at the top represent?Of course, if they are elected politicians, they are supposed to represent thosewho elected them; and, if they are appointed, they are supposed to represent,indirectly, those who elected their appointers. But this is recognized assomething of an abstraction, as a rhetorical formula by which all men of powerin almost all systems of government nowadays justify their power of decision. Attimes it may be true, both in the sense of their motives and in the sense of whobenefits from their decisions. Yet it would not be wise in any power systemmerely to assume it.The fact that members of the power elite come from near the top of the nation’sclass and status levels does not mean that they are necessarily ‘representative’of the top levels only. And if they were, as social types, representative of across-section of the population, that would not mean that a balanced democracyof interest and power would automatically be the going political fact.We cannot infer the direction of policy merely from the social origins andcareers of the policy-makers. The social and economic backgrounds of the men ofpower do not tell us all that we need to know in order to understand thedistribution of social power. For: (1) Men from high places may be ideologicalrepresentatives of the poor and humble. (2) Men of humble origin, brightlyself-made, may energetically serve the most vested and inherited interests.Moreover (3), not all men who effectively represent the interests of a stratumneed in any way belong to it or personally benefit by policies that further itsinterests. Among the politicians, in short, there are sympathetic agents ofgiven groups, conscious and unconscious, paid and unpaid. Finally (4), among thetop decision-makers we find men who have been chosen for their positions becauseof their ‘expert knowledge.’ These are some of the obvious reasons why thesocial origins and careers of of the power elite do not enable us to infer theclass interests and policy directions of a modern system of power.Do the high social origin and careers of the top men mean nothing, then, aboutthe distribution of power? By no means. They simply remind us that we must becareful of any simple and direct inference from origin and career to politicalcharacter and policy, not that we must ignore them in our attempt at politicalunderstanding. They simply mean that we must analyze the political psychologyand the actual decisions of the political directorate as well as its socialcomposition. And they mean, above all, that we should control, as we have donehere, any inference we make from the origin and careers of the political actorsby close understanding of the institutional landscape in which they act outtheir drama. Otherwise we should be guilty of a rather simple-mindedbiographical theory of society and history.Just as we cannot rest the notion of the power elite solely upon theinstitutional mechanics that lead to its formation, so we cannot rest the notionsolely upon the facts of the origin and career of its personnel. We need both,and we have both—as well as other bases, among them that of the statusintermingling.But it is not only the similarities of social origin, religious affiliation,nativity, and education that are important to the psychological and socialaffinities of the members of the power elite. Even if their recruitment andformal training were more heterogeneous than they are, these men would still beof quite homogeneous social type. For the most important set of facts about acircle of men is the criteria of admission, of praise, of honor, of promotionthat prevails among them; if these are similar within a circle, then they willtend as personalities to become similar. The circles that compose the powerelite do tend to have such codes and criteria in common. The co-optation of thesocial types to which these common values lead is often more important than anystatistics of common origin and career that we might have at hand.There is a kind of reciprocal attraction among the fraternity of thesuccessful—not between each and every member of the circles of the high andmighty, but between enough of them to insure a certain unity. On the slightside, it is a sort of tacit, mutual admiration; in the strongest tie-ins, itproceeds by intermarriage. And there are all grades and types of connectionbetween these extremes. Some overlaps certainly occur by means of cliques andclubs, churches and schools.If social origin and formal education in common tend to make the members of thepower elite more readily understood and trusted by one another, their continuedassociation further cements what they feel they have in common. Members of theseveral higher circles know one another as personal friends and even asneighbors; they mingle with one another on the golf course, in the gentleman’sclubs, at resorts, on transcontinental airplanes, and on ocean liners. They meetat the estates of mutual friends, face each other in front of the TV camera, orserve on the same philanthropic committee; and many are sure to cross oneanother’s path in the columns of newspapers, if not in the exact cafes fromwhich many of these columns originate. As we have seen, of ‘The New 400’ of cafesociety, one chronicler has named forty-one members of the very rich,ninety-three political leaders, and seventy-nine chief executives ofcorporations.* [page_281.html#pg281fn1a]‘I did not know, I could not have dreamed,’ Whittaker Chambers has written, ‘ofthe immense scope and power of Hiss’ political alliances and his socialconnections, which cut across all party lines and ran from the Supreme Court tothe Religious Society of Friends, from governors of states and instructors incollege faculties to the staff members of liberal magazines. In the decade sinceI had last seen him, he had used his career, and, in particular, hisidentification with the cause of peace through his part in organizing the UnitedNations, to put down roots that made him one with the matted forest floor ofAmerican upper class, enlightened middle class, liberal and official life. Hisroots could not be disturbed without disturbing all the roots on all sides ofhim.’8 [ch15_notes.html#ch12en8]The sphere of status has reflected the epochs of the power elite. In the thirdepoch, for example, who could compete with big money? And in the fourth, withbig politicians, or even the bright young men of the New Deal? And in the fifth,who can compete with the generals and the admirals and the corporate officialsnow so sympathetically portrayed on the stage, in the novel, and on the screen?Can one imagine Executive Suite as a successful motion picture in 1935? Or TheCaine Mutiny?The multiplicity of high-prestige organizations to which the elite usuallybelong is revealed by even casual examination of the obituaries of the bigbusinessman, the high-prestige lawyer, the top general and admiral, the keysenator: usually, high-prestige church, business associations, plushigh-prestige clubs, and often plus military rank. In the course of theirlifetimes, the university president, the New York Stock Exchange chairman, thehead of the bank, the old West Pointer—mingle in the status sphere, within whichthey easily renew old friendships and draw upon them in an effort to understandthrough the experience of trusted others those contexts of power and decision inwhich they have not personally moved.In these diverse contexts, prestige accumulates in each of the higher circles,and the members of each borrow status from one another. Their self-images arefed by these accumulations and these borrowings, and accordingly, howeversegmental a given man’s role may seem, he comes to feel himself a ‘diffuse’ or‘generalized’ man of the higher circles. a ‘broad-gauge’ man. Perhaps suchinside experience is one feature of what is meant by ‘judgment.’The key organizations, perhaps, are the major corporations themselves, for onthe boards of directors we find a heavy overlapping among the members of theseseveral elites. On the lighter side, again in the summer and winter resorts, wefind that, in an intricate series of overlapping circles; in the course of time,each meets each or knows somebody who knows somebody who knows that one.The higher members of the military, economic, and political orders are ablereadily to take over one another’s point of view, always in a sympathetic way,and often in a knowledgeable way as well. They define one another as among thosewho count, and who, accordingly, must be taken into account. Each of them as amember of the power elite comes to incorporate into his own integrity, his ownhonor, his own conscience, the viewpoint, the expectations, the values of theothers. If there are no common ideals and standards among them that are basedupon an explicitly aristocratic culture, that does not mean that they do notfeel responsibility to one another.All the structural coincidence of their interests as well as the intricate,psychological facts of their origins and their education, their careers andtheir associations make possible the psychological affinities that prevail amongthem, affinities that make it possible for them to say of one another: He is, ofcourse, one of us. And all this points to the basic, psychological meaning ofclass consciousness. Nowhere in America is there as great a ‘classconsciousness’ as among the elite; nowhere is it organized as effectively asamong the power elite. For by class consciousness, as a psychological fact, onemeans that the individual member of a ‘class’ accepts only those accepted by hiscircle as among those who are significant to his own image of self.Within the higher circles of the power elite, factions do exist; there areconflicts of policy; individual ambitions do clash. There are still enoughdivisions of importance within the Republican party, and even betweenRepublicans and Democrats, to make for different methods of operation. But morepowerful than these divisions are the internal discipline and the community ofinterests that bind the power elite together, even across the boundaries ofnations at war.9 [ch15_notes.html#ch12en9]4Yet we must give due weight to the other side of the case which may not questionthe facts but only our interpretation of them. There is a set of objections thatwill inevitably be made to our whole conception of the power elite, but whichhas essentially to do with only the psychology of its members. It might well beput by liberals or by conservatives in some such way as this:‘To talk of a power elite—isn’t this to characterize men by their origins andassociations? Isn’t such characterization both unfair and untrue? Don’t menmodify themselves, especially Americans such as these, as they rise in statureto meet the demands of their jobs? Don’t they arrive at a view and a line ofpolicy that represents, so far as they in their human weaknesses can know, theinterests of the nation as a whole? Aren’t they merely honorable men who aredoing their duty?’What are we to reply to these objections?I. We are sure that they are honorable men. But what is honor? Honor can onlymean living up to a code that one believes to be honorable. There is no one codeupon which we are all agreed. That is why, if we are civilized men, we do notkill off all of those with whom we disagree. The question is not: are thesehonorable men? The question is: what are their codes of honor? The answer tothat question is that they are the codes of their circles, of those to whoseopinions they defer. How could it be otherwise? That is one meaning of theimportant truism that all men are human and that all men are social creatures.As for sincerity, it can only be disproved, never proved.II. To the question of their adaptability—which means their capacity totranscend the codes of conduct which, in their life’s work and experience, theyhave acquired—we must answer: simply no, they cannot, at least not in thehandful of years most of them have left. To expect that is to assume that theyare indeed strange and expedient: such flexibility would in fact involve aviolation of what we may rightly call their character and their integrity. Bythe way, may it not be precisely because of the lack of such character andintegrity that earlier types of American politicians have not represented asgreat a threat as do these men of character?It would be an insult to the effective training of the military, and to theirindoctrination as well, to suppose that military officials shed their militarycharacter and outlook upon changing from uniform to mufti. This background ismore important perhaps in the military case than in that of the corporateexecutives, for the training of the career is deeper and more total.‘Lack of imagination,’ Gerald W. Johnson has noted, ‘is not to be confused withlack of principle. On the contrary, an unimaginative man is often a man of thehighest principles. The trouble is that his principles conform to Cornford’sfamous definition: “A principle is a rule of inaction giving valid generalreasons for not doing in a specific instance what to unprincipled instinct wouldseem to be right.” ’10 [ch15_notes.html#ch12en10]Would it not be ridiculous, for example, to believe seriously that, inpsychological fact, Charles Erwin Wilson represented anyone or any interestother than those of the corporate world? This is not because he is dishonest; onthe contrary, it is because he is probably a man of solid integrity—as sound asa dollar. He is what he is and he cannot very well be anything else. He is amember of the professional corporation elite, just as are his colleagues, in thegovernment and out of it; he represents the wealth of the higher corporateworld; he represents its power; and he believes sincerely in his oft-quotedremark that ‘what is good for the United States is good for the General MotorsCorporation and vice versa.’The revealing point about the pitiful hearings on the confirmation of such menfor political posts is not the cynicism toward the law and toward the lawmakerson the middle levels of power which they display, nor their reluctance todispose of their personal stock.11 [ch15_notes.html#ch12en11] The interestingpoint is how impossible it is for such men to divest themselves of theirengagement with the corporate world in general and with their own corporationsin particular. Not only their money, but their friends, their interests, theirtraining—their lives in short—are deeply involved in this world. The disposal ofstock is, of course, merely a purifying ritual. The point is not so muchfinancial or personal interests in a given corporation, but identification withthe corporate world. To ask a man suddenly to divest himself of these interestsand sensibilities is almost like asking a man to become a woman.III. To the question of their patriotism, of their desire to serve the nation asa whole, we must answer first that, like codes of honor, feelings of patriotismand views of what is to the whole nation’s good, are not ultimate facts butmatters upon which there exists a great variety of opinion. Furthermore,patriotic opinions too are rooted in and are sustained by what a man has becomeby virtue of how and with whom he has lived. This is no simple mechanicaldetermination of individual character by social conditions; it is an intricateprocess, well established in the major tradition of modern social study. One canonly wonder why more social scientists do not use it systematically inspeculating about politics.IV. The elite cannot be truly thought of as men who are merely doing their duty.They are the ones who determine their duty, as well as the duties of thosebeneath them. They are not merely following orders: they give the orders. Theyare not merely ‘bureaucrats’: they command bureaucracies. They may try todisguise these facts from others and from themselves by appeals to traditions ofwhich they imagine themselves the instruments, but there are many traditions,and they must choose which ones they will serve. They face decisions for whichthere simply are no traditions.Now, to what do these several answers add up? To the fact that we cannot reasonabout public events and historical trends merely from knowledge about themotives and character of the men or the small groups who sit in the seats of thehigh and mighty. This fact, in turn, does not mean that we should be intimidatedby accusations that in taking up our problem in the way we have, we areimpugning the honor, the integrity, or the ability of those who are in highoffice. For it is not, in the first instance, a question of individualcharacter; and if, in further instances, we find that it is, we should nothesitate to say so plainly. In the meantime, we must judge men of power by thestandards of power, by what they do as decision-makers, and not by who they areor what they may do in private life. Our interest is not in that: we areinterested in their policies and in the consequences of their conduct of office.We must remember that these men of the power elite now occupy the strategicplaces in the structure of American society; that they command the dominantinstitutions of a dominant nation; that, as a set of men, they are in a positionto make decisions with terrible consequences for the underlying populations ofthe world.5Despite their social similarity and psychological affinities, the members of thepower elite do not constitute a club having a permanent membership with fixedand formal boundaries. It is of the nature of the power elite that within itthere is a good deal of shifting about, and that it thus does not consist of onesmall set of the same men in the same positions in the same hierarchies. Becausemen know each other personally does not mean that among them there is a unity ofpolicy; and because they do not know each other personally does not mean thatamong them there is a disunity. The conception of the power elite does not rest,as I have repeatedly said, primarily upon personal friendship.As the requirements of the top places in each of the major hierarchies becomesimilar, the types of men occupying these roles at the top—by selection and bytraining in the jobs—become similar. This is no mere deduction from structure topersonnel. That it is a fact is revealed by the heavy traffic that has beengoing on between the three structures, often in very intricate patterns. Thechief executives, the warlords, and selected politicians came into contact withone another in an intimate, working way during World War II; after that warended, they continued their associations, out of common beliefs, socialcongeniality, and coinciding interests. Noticeable proportions of top men fromthe military, the economic, and the political worlds have during the lastfifteen years occupied positions in one or both of the other worlds: betweenthese higher circles there is an interchangeability of position, based formallyupon the supposed transferability of ‘executive ability,’ based in substanceupon the co-optation by cliques of insiders. As members of a power elite, manyof those busy in this traffic have come to look upon ‘the government’ as anumbrella under whose authority they do their work.As the business between the big three increases in volume and importance, sodoes the traffic in personnel. The very criteria for selecting men who will risecome to embody this fact. The corporate commissar, dealing with the state andits military, is wiser to choose a young man who has experienced the state andits military than one who has not. The political director, often dependent forhis own political success upon corporate decisions and corporations, is alsowiser to choose a man with corporate experience. Thus, by virtue of the verycriterion of success, the interchange of personnel and the unity of the powerelite is increased.Given the formal similarity of the three hierarchies in which the severalmembers of the elite spend their working lives, given the ramifications of thedecisions made in each upon the others, given the coincidence of interest thatprevails among them at many points, and given the administrative vacuum of theAmerican civilian state along with its enlargement of tasks—given these trendsof structure, and adding to them the psychological affinities we have noted—weshould indeed be surprised were we to find that men said to be skilled inadministrative contacts and full of organizing ability would fail to do morethan get in touch with one another. They have, of course, done much more thanthat: increasingly, they assume positions in one another’s domains.The unity revealed by the interchangeability of top roles rests upon theparallel development of the top jobs in each of the big three domains. Theinterchange occurs most frequently at the points of their coinciding interest,as between regulatory agency and the regulated industry; contracting agency andcontractor. And, as we shall see, it leads to co-ordinations that are moreexplicit, and even formal.The inner core of the power elite consists, first, of those who interchangecommanding roles at the top of one dominant institutional order with those inanother: the admiral who is also a banker and a lawyer and who heads up animportant federal commission; the corporation executive whose company was one ofthe two or three leading war materiel producers who is now the Secretary ofDefense; the wartime general who dons civilian clothes to sit on the politicaldirectorate and then becomes a member of the board of directors or a leadingeconomic corporation.Although the executive who becomes a general, the general who becomes astatesman, the statesman who becomes a banker, see much more than ordinary menin their ordinary environments, still the perspectives of even such men oftenremain tied to their dominant locales. In their very career, however, theyinterchange roles within the big three and thus readily transcend theparticularity of interest in any one of these institutional milieux. By theirvery careers and activities, they lace the three types of milieux together. Theyare, accordingly, the core members of the power elite.These men are not necessarily familiar with every major arena of power. We referto one man who moves in and between perhaps two circles—say the industrial andthe military—and to another man who moves in the military and the political, andto a third who moves in the political as well as among opinion-makers. Thesein-between types most closely display our image of the power elite’s structureand operation, even of behind-the-scenes operations. To the extent that there isany ‘invisible elite,’ these advisory and liaison types are its core. Even if—asI believe to be very likely—many of them are, at least in the first part oftheir careers, ‘agents’ of the various elites rather than themselves elite, itis they who are most active in organizing the several top milieux into astructure of power and maintaining it.The inner core of the power elite also includes men of the higher legal andfinancial type from the great law factories and investment firms, who are almostprofessional go-betweens of economic, political and military affairs, and whothus act to unify the power elite. The corporation lawyer and the investmentbanker perform the functions of the ‘go-between’ effectively and powerfully. Bythe nature of their work, they transcend the narrower milieu of any oneindustry, and accordingly are in a position to speak and act for the corporateworld or at least sizable sectors of it. The corporation lawyer is a key linkbetween the economic and military and political areas; the investment banker isa key organizer and unifier of the corporate world and a person well versed inspending the huge amounts of money the American military establishment nowponders. When you get a lawyer who handles the legal work of investment bankersyou get a key member of the power elite.During the Democratic era, one link between private corporate organizations andgovernmental institutions was the investment house of Dillon, Read. From it camesuch men as James Forrestal and Charles F. Detmar, Jr.; Ferdinand Eberstadt hadonce been a partner in it before he branched out into his own investment housefrom which came other men to political and military circles. Republicanadministrations seem to favor the investment firm of Kuhn, Loeb and theadvertising firm of Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborn.Regardless of administrations, there is always the law firm of Sullivan andCromwell. Mid-West investment banker Cyrus Eaton has said that ‘Arthur H. Dean,a senior partner of Sullivan & Cromwell of No. 48 Wall Street, was one of thosewho assisted in the drafting of the Securities Act of 1933, the first of theseries of bills passed to regulate the capital markets. He and his firm, whichis reputed to be the largest in the United States, have maintained closerelations with the SEC since its creation, and theirs is the dominatinginfluence on the Commission.’12 [ch15_notes.html#ch12en12]There is also the third largest bank in the United States: the Chase NationalBank of New York (now Chase-Manhattan). Regardless of political administration,executives of this bank and those of the International Bank of Reconstructionand Development have changed positions: John J. McCloy, who became Chairman ofthe Chase National in 1953, is a former president of the World Bank; and hissuccessor to the presidency of the World Bank was a former senior vice-presidentof the Chase National Bank.13 [ch15_notes.html#ch12en13] And in 1953, thepresident of the Chase National Bank, Winthrop W. Aldrich, had left to becomeAmbassador to Great Britain.The outermost fringes of the power elite—which change more than its core—consistof ‘those who count’ even though they may not be ‘in’ on given decisions ofconsequence nor in their career move between the hierarchies. Each member of thepower elite need not be a man who personally decides every decision that is tobe ascribed to the power elite. Each member, in the decisions that he does make,takes the others seriously into account. They not only make decisions in theseveral major areas of war and peace; they are the men who, in decisions inwhich they take no direct part, are taken into decisive account by those who aredirectly in charge.On the fringes and below them, somewhat to the side of the lower echelons, thepower elite fades off into the middle levels of power, into the rank and file ofthe Congress, the pressure groups that are not vested in the power elite itself,as well as a multiplicity of regional and state and local interests. If all themen on the middle levels are not among those who count, they sometimes must betaken into account, handled, cajoled, broken or raised to higher circles.When the power elite find that in order to get things done they must reach belowtheir own realms—as is the case when it is necessary to get bills passed throughCongress—they themselves must exert some pressure. But among the power elite,the name for such high-level lobbying is ‘liaison work.’ There are ‘liaison’military men with Congress, with certain wayward sections of industry, withpractically every important element not directly concerned with the power elite.The two men on the White House staff who are named ‘liaison’ men are bothexperienced in military matters; one of them is a former investment banker andlawyer as well as a general.Not the trade associations but the higher cliques of lawyers and investmentbankers are the active political heads of the corporate rich and the members ofthe power elite. ‘While it is generally assumed that the national associationscarry tremendous weight in formulating public opinion and directing the courseof national policy, there is some evidence to indicate that interaction betweenassociations on a formal level is not a very tight-knit affair. The generaltendency within associations seems to be to stimulate activities around thespecific interests of the organization, and more effort is made to educate itsmembers rather than to spend much time in trying to influence other associationson the issue at hand … As media for stating and re-stating the over-all valuestructure of the nation they (the trade associations) are important … But whenissues are firmly drawn, individuals related to the larger corporate interestsare called upon to exert pressure in the proper places at the strategic time Thenational associations may act as media for co-ordinating such pressures, but agreat volume of intercommunication between members at the apex of power of thelarger corporate interests seems to be the decisive factor in final policydetermination.’14 [ch15_notes.html#ch12en14]Conventional ‘lobbying,’ carried on by trade associations, still exists,although it usually concerns the middle levels of power-usually being targetedat Congress and, of course, its own rank and file members. The importantfunction of the National Association of Manufacturers, for example, is lessdirectly to influence policy than to reveal to small businessmen that theirinterests are the same as those of larger businesses. But there is also‘high-level lobbying.’ All over the country the corporate leaders are drawn intothe circle of the high military and political through personal friendship, tradeand professonal associations and their various subcommittees, prestige clubs,open political affiliation, and customer relationships. ‘There is … an awarenessamong these power leaders,’ one first-hand investigator of such executivecliques has asserted, ‘of many of the current major policy issues before thenation such as keeping taxes down, turning all productive operations over toprivate enterprises, increasing foreign trade, keeping governmental welfare andother domestic activities to a minimum, and strengthening and maintaining thehold of the current party in power nationally.’15 [ch15_notes.html#ch12en15]There are, in fact, cliques of corporate executives who are more important asinformal opinion leaders in the top echelons of corporate, military, andpolitical power than as actual participants in military and politicalorganizations. Inside military circles and inside political circles and ‘on thesidelines’ in the economic area, these circles and cliques of corporationexecutives are in on most all major decisions regardless of topic. And what isimportant about all this high-level lobbying is that it is done within theconfines of that elite.6The conception of the power elite and of its unity rests upon the correspondingdevelopments and the coincidence of interests among economic, political, andmilitary organizations. It also rests upon the similarity of origin and outlook,and the social and personal intermingling of the top circles from each of thesedominant hierarchies. This conjunction of institutional and psychologicalforces, in turn, is revealed by the heavy personnel traffic within and betweenthe big three institutional orders, as well as by the rise of go-betweens as inthe high-level lobbying. The conception of the power elite, accordingly, doesnot rest upon the assumption that American history since the origins of WorldWar II must be understood as a secret plot, or as a great and co-ordinatedconspiracy of the members of this elite. The conception rests upon quiteimpersonal grounds.There is, however, little doubt that the American power elite—which contains, weare told, some of ‘the greatest organizers in the world’—has also planned andhas plotted. The rise of the elite, as we have already made clear, was not andcould not have been caused by a plot; and the tenability of the conception doesnot rest upon the existence of any secret or any publicly known organization.But, once the conjunction of structural trend and of the personal will toutilize it gave rise to the power elite, then plans and programs did occur toits members and indeed it is not possible to interpret many events and officialpolicies of the fifth epoch without reference to the power elite. ‘There is agreat difference,’ Richard Hofstadter has remarked, ‘between locatingconspiracies in history and saying that history is, in effect, a conspiracy …’16 [ch15_notes.html#ch12en16]The structural trends of institutions become defined as opportunities by thosewho occupy their command posts. Once such opportunities are recognized, men mayavail themselves of them. Certain types of men from each of the dominantinstitutional areas, more far-sighted than others, have actively promoted theliaison before it took its truly modern shape. They have often done so forreasons not shared by their partners, although not objected to by them either;and often the outcome of their liaison has had consequences which none of themforesaw, much less shaped, and which only later in the course of developmentcame under explicit control. Only after it was well under way did most of itsmembers find themselves part of it and become gladdened, although sometimes alsoworried, by this fact. But once the co-ordination is a going concern, new mencome readily into it and assume its existence without question.So far as explicit organization—conspiratorial or not—is concerned, the powerelite, by its very nature, is more likely to use existing organizations, workingwithin and between them, than to set up explicit organizations whose membershipis strictly limited to its own members. But if there is no machinery inexistence to ensure, for example, that military and political factors will bebalanced in decisions made, they will invent such machinery and use it, as withthe National Security Council. Moreover, in a formally democratic polity, theaims and the powers of the various elements of this elite are further supportedby an aspect of the permanent war economy: the assumption that the security ofthe nation supposedly rests upon great secrecy of plan and intent. Many higherevents that would reveal the working of the power elite can be withheld frompublic knowledge under the guise of secrecy. With the wide secrecy coveringtheir operations and decisions, the power elite can mask their intentions,operations, and further consolidation. Any secrecy that is imposed upon those inpositions to observe high decision-makers clearly works for and not against theoperations of the power elite.There is accordingly reason to suspect—but by the nature of the case, noproof—that the power elite is not altogether ‘surfaced.’ There is nothing hiddenabout it, although its activities are not publicized. As an elite, it is notorganized, although its members often know one another, seem quite naturally towork together, and share many organizations in common. There is nothingconspiratorial about it, although its decisions are often publicly unknown andits mode of operation manipulative rather than explicit.It is not that the elite ‘believe in’ a compact elite behind the scenes and amass down below. It is not put in that language. It is just that the people areof necessity confused and must, like trusting children, place all the new worldof foreign policy and strategy and executive action in the hands of experts. Itis just that everyone knows somebody has got to run the show, and that somebodyusually does. Others do not really care anyway, and besides, they do not knowhow. So the gap between the two types gets wider.When crises are defined as total, and as seemingly permanent, the consequencesof decision become total, and the decisions in each major area of life come tobe integrated and total. Up to a point, these consequences for otherinstitutional orders can be assessed; beyond such points, chances have to betaken. It is then that the felt scarcity of trained and imaginative judgmentleads to plaintive feelings among executives about the shortage of qualifiedsuccessors in political, military, and economic life. This feeling, in turn,leads to an increasing concern with the training of successors who could takeover as older men of power retire.17 [ch15_notes.html#ch12en17] In each area,there slowly arises a new generation which has grown up in an age ofco-ordinated decisions.In each of the elite circles, we have noticed this concern to recruit and totrain successors as ‘broad-gauge’ men, that is, as men capable of makingdecisions that involve institutional areas other than their own. The chiefexecutives have set up formal recruitment and training programs to man thecorporate world as virtually a state within a state. Recruitment and trainingfor the military elite has long been rigidly professionalized, but has now cometo include educational routines of a sort which the remnants of older generalsand admirals consider quite nonsensical.Only the political order, with its absence of a genuine civil service, haslagged behind, creating an administrative vacuum into which military bureaucratsand corporate outsiders have been drawn. But even in this domain, since WorldWar II, there have been repeated attempts, by elite men of such vision as thelate James Forrestal’s, to inaugurate a career service that would includeperiods in the corporate world as well as in the governmental.18[ch15_notes.html#ch12en18]What is lacking is a truly common elite program of recruitment and training; forthe prep school, Ivy League College, and law school sequence of the metropolitan400 is not up to the demands now made upon members of the power elite.*[page_295.html#pg295fn1a]19 [ch15_notes.html#ch12en19] Britishers, such as FieldMarshall Viscount Montgomery, well aware of this lack, recently urged theadoption of a system ‘under which a minority of high-caliber young studentscould be separated from the mediocre and given the best education possible tosupply the country with leadership.’ His proposal is echoed, in various forms,by many who accept his criticism of ‘the American theory of public education on,the ground that it is ill-suited to produce the “elite” group of leaders … thiscountry needs to fulfill its obligations of world leadership.’20[ch15_notes.html#ch12en20]In part these demands reflect the unstated need to transcend recruitment on thesole basis of economic success, especially since it is suspect as ofteninvolving the higher immorality; in part it reflects the stated need to have menwho, as Viscount Montgomery says, know ‘the meaning of discipline.’ But aboveall these demands reflect the at least vague consciousness on the part of thepower elite themselves that the age of co-ordinated decisions, entailing a newlyenormous range of consequences, requires a power elite that is of a new caliber.In so far as the sweep of matters which go into the making of decisions is vastand interrelated, the information needed for judgments complex and requiringparticularized knowledge,21 [ch15_notes.html#ch12en21] the men in charge willnot only call upon one another; they will try to train their successors for thework at hand. These new men will grow up as men of power within theco-ordination of economic and political and military decision.7The idea of the power elite rests upon and enables us to make sense of (1) thedecisive institutional trends that characterize the structure of our epoch, inparticular, the military ascendancy in a privately incorporated economy, andmore broadly, the several coincidences of objective interests between economic,military, and political institutions; (2) the social similarities and thepsychological affinities of the men who occupy the command posts of thesestructures, in particular the increased interchangeability of the top positionsin each of them and the increased traffic between these orders in the careers ofmen of power; (3) the ramifications, to the point of virtual totality, of thekind of decisions that are made at the top, and the rise to power of a set ofmen who, by training and bent, are professional organizers of considerable forceand who are unrestrained by democratic party training.Negatively, the formation of the power elite rests upon (1) the relegation ofthe professional party politician to the middle levels of power, (2) thesemi-organized stalemate of the interests of sovereign localities into which thelegislative function has fallen, (3) the virtually complete absence of a civilservice that constitutes a politically neutral, but politically relevant,depository of brainpower and executive skill, and (4) the increased officialsecrecy behind which great decisions are made without benefit of public or evenCongressional debate.As a result, the political directorate, the corporate rich, and the ascendantmilitary have come together as the power elite, and the expanded and centralizedhierarchies which they head have encroached upon the old balances and have nowrelegated them to the middle levels of power. Now the balancing society is aconception that pertains accurately to the middle levels, and on that level thebalance has become more often an affair of intrenched provincial and nationallyirresponsible forces and demands than a center of power and national decision.But how about the bottom? As all these trends have become visible at the top andon the middle, what has been happening to the great American public? If the topis unprecedentedly powerful and increasingly unified and willful; if the middlezones are increasingly a semi-organized stalemate—in what shape is the bottom,in what condition is the public at large? The rise of the power elite, we shallnow see, rests upon, and in some ways is part of, the transformation of thepublics of America into a mass society."},{"pageContent":"13THE MASS SOCIETYIN the standard image of power and decision, no force is held to be as importantas The Great American Public. More than merely another check and balance, thispublic is thought to be the seat of all legitimate power. In official life as inpopular folklore, it is held to be the very balance wheel of democratic power.In the end, all liberal theorists rest their notions of the power system uponthe political role of this public; all official decisions, as well as privatedecisions of consequence, are justified as in the public’s welfare; all formalproclamations are in its name.1Let us therefore consider the classic public of democratic theory in thegenerous spirit in which Rousseau once cried, ‘Opinion, Queen of the World, isnot subject to the power of kings; they are themselves its first slaves.’The most important feature of the public of opinion, which the rise of thedemocratic middle class initiates, is the free ebb and flow of discussion. Thepossibilities of answering back, of organizing autonomous organs of publicopinion, of realizing opinion in action, are held to be established bydemocratic institutions. The opinion that results from public discussion isunderstood to be a resolution that is then carried out by public action; it is,in one version, the ‘general will’ of the people, which the legislative organenacts into law, thus lending to it legal force. Congress, or Parliament, as aninstitution, crowns all the scattered publics; it is the archetype for each ofthe little circles of face-to-face citizens discussing their public business.This eighteenth-century idea of the public of public opinion parallels theeconomic idea of the market of the free economy. Here is the market composed offreely competing entrepreneurs; there is the public composed of discussioncircles of opinion peers. As price is the result of anonymous, equally weighted,bargaining individuals, so public opinion is the result of each man’s havingthought things out for himself and contributing his voice to the great chorus.To be sure, some might have more influence on the state of opinion than others,but no one group monopolizes the discussion, or by itself determines theopinions that prevail.Innumerable discussion circles are knit together by mobile people who carryopinions from one to another, and struggle for the power of larger command. Thepublic is thus organized into associations and parties, each representing a setof viewpoints, each trying to acquire a place in the Congress, where thediscussion continues. Out of the little circles of people talking with oneanother, the larger forces of social movements and political parties develop;and the discussion of opinion is the important phase in a total act by whichpublic affairs are conducted.The autonomy of these discussions is an important element in the idea of publicopinion as a democratic legitimation. The opinions formed are actively realizedwithin the prevailing institutions of power; all authoritative agents are madeor broken by the prevailing opinions of these publics. And, in so far as thepublic is frustrated in realizing its demands, its members may go beyondcriticism of specific policies; they may question the very legitimations oflegal authority. That is one meaning of Jefferson’s comment on the need for anoccasional ‘revolution.’The public, so conceived, is the loom of classic, eighteenth-century democracy;discussion is at once the threads and the shuttle tying the discussion circlestogether. It lies at the root of the conception of authority by discussion, andit is based upon the hope that truth and justice will somehow come out ofsociety as a great apparatus of free discussion. The people are presented withproblems. They discuss them. They decide on them. They formulate viewpoints.These viewpoints are organized, and they compete. One viewpoint ‘wins out.’ Thenthe people act out this view, or their representatives are instructed to act itout, and this they promptly do.Such are the images of the public of classic democracy which are still used asthe working justifications of power in American society. But now we mustrecognize this description as a set of images out of a fairy tale: they are notadequate even as an approximate model of how the American system of power works.The issues that now shape man’s fate are neither raised nor decided by thepublic at large. The idea of the community of publics is not a description offact, but an assertion of an ideal, an assertion of a legitimationmasquerading—as legitimations are now apt to do—as fact. For now the public ofpublic opinion is recognized by all those who have considered it carefully assomething less than it once was.These doubts are asserted positively in the statement that the classic communityof publics is being transformed into a society of masses. This transformation,in fact, is one of the keys to the social and psychological meaning of modernlife in America.I. In the democratic society of publics it was assumed, with John Locke, thatthe individual conscience was the ultimate seat of judgment and hence the finalcourt of appeal. But this principle was challenged—as E. H. Carr has put it—whenRousseau ‘for the first time thought in terms of the sovereignty of the wholepeople, and faced the issue of mass democracy.’1 [ch15_notes.html#ch13en1]II. In the democratic society of publics it was assumed that among theindividuals who composed it there was a natural and peaceful harmony ofinterests. But this essentially conservative doctrine gave way to theUtilitarian doctrine that such a harmony of interests had first to be created byreform before it could work, and later to the Marxian doctrine of classstruggle, which surely was then, and certainly is now, closer to reality thanany assumed harmony of interests.III. In the democratic society of publics it was assumed that before publicaction would be taken, there would be rational discussion between individualswhich would determine the action, and that, accordingly, the public opinion thatresulted would be the infallible voice of reason. But this has been challengednot only (1) by the assumed need for experts to decide delicate and intricateissues, but (2) by the discovery—as by Freud—of the irrationality of the man inthe street, and (3) by the discovery—as by Marx—of the socially conditionednature of what was once assumed to be autonomous reason.IV. In the democratic society of publics it was assumed that after determiningwhat is true and right and just, the public would act accordingly or see thatits representatives did so. In the long run, public opinion will not only beright, but public opinion will prevail. This assumption has been upset by thegreat gap now existing between the underlying population and those who makedecisions in its name, decisions of enormous consequence which the public oftendoes not even know are being made until well after the fact.Given these assumptions, it is not difficult to understand the articulateoptimism of many nineteenth-century thinkers, for the theory of the public is,in many ways, a projection upon the community at large of the intellectual’sideal of the supremacy of intellect. The ‘evolution of the intellect,’ Comteasserted, ‘determines the main course of social evolution.’ If looking aboutthem, nineteenth-century thinkers still saw irrationality and ignorance andapathy, all that was merely an intellectual lag, to which the spread ofeducation would soon put an end.How much the cogency of the classic view of the public rested upon a restrictionof this public to the carefully educated is revealed by the fact that by 1859even John Stuart Mill was writing of ‘the tyranny of the majority,’ and bothTocqueville and Burckhardt anticipated the view popularized in the recent pastby such political moralists as Ortega y Gasset. In a word, the transformation ofpublic into mass—and all that this implies—has been at once one of the majortrends of modern societies and one of the major factors in the collapse of thatliberal optimism which determined so much of the intellectual mood of thenineteenth century.By the middle of that century: individualism had begun to be replaced bycollective forms of economic and political life; harmony of interests byinharmonious struggle of classes and organized pressures; rational discussionsundermined by expert decisions on complicated issues, by recognition of theinterested bias of argument by vested position; and by the discovery of theeffectiveness of irrational appeal to the citizen. Moreover, certain structuralchanges of modern society, which we shall presently consider, had begun to cutoff the public from the power of active decision.2The transformation of public into mass is of particular concern to us, for itprovides an important clue to the meaning of the power elite. If that elite istruly responsible to, or even exists in connection with, a community of publics,it carries a very different meaning than if such a public is being transformedinto a society of masses.The United States today is not altogether a mass society, and it has never beenaltogether a community of publics These phrases are names for extreme types;they point to certain features of reality, but they are themselvesconstructions; social reality is always some sort of mixture of the two. Yet wecannot readily understand just how much of which is mixed into our situation ifwe do not first understand, in terms of explicit dimensions, the clear-cut andextreme types:At least four dimensions must be attended to if we are to grasp the differencesbetween public and mass.I. There is first, the ratio of the givers of opinion to the receivers, which isthe simplest way to state the social meaning of the formal media of masscommunication. More than anything else, it is the shift in this ratio which iscentral to the problems of the public and of public opinion in latter-day phasesof democracy. At one extreme on the scale of communication, two people talkpersonally with each other; at the opposite extreme, one spokesman talksimpersonally through a network of communications to millions of listeners andviewers. In between these extremes there are assemblages and political rallies,parliamentary sessions, law-court debates, small discussion circles dominated byone man, open discussion circles with talk moving freely back and forth amongfifty people, and so on.II. The second dimension to which we must pay attention is the possibility ofanswering back an opinion without internal or external reprisals being taken.Technical conditions of the means of communication, in imposing a lower ratio ofspeakers to listeners, may obviate the possibility of freely answering back.Informal rules, resting upon conventional sanction and upon the informalstructure of opinion leadership, may govern who can speak, when, and for howlong. Such rules may or may not be in congruence with formal rules and withinstitutional sanctions which govern the process of communication. In theextreme case, we may conceive of an absolute monopoly of communication topacified media groups whose members cannot answer back even ‘in private.’ At theopposite extreme, the conditions may allow and the rules may uphold the wide andsymmetrical formation of opinion.III. We must also consider the relation of the formation of opinion to itsrealization in social action, the ease with which opinion is effective in theshaping of decisions of powerful consequence. This opportunity for people to actout their opinions collectively is of course limited by their position in thestructure of power. This structure may be such as to limit decisively thiscapacity, or it may allow or even invite such action. It may confine socialaction to local areas or it may enlarge the area of opportunity; it may makeaction intermittent or more or less continuous.IV. There is, finally, the degree to which institutional authority, with itssanctions and controls, penetrates the public. Here the problem is the degree towhich the public has genuine autonomy from instituted authority. At one extreme,no agent of formal authority moves among the autonomous public. At the oppositeextreme, the public is terrorized into uniformity by the infiltration ofinformers and the universalization of suspicion. One thinks of the late Nazistreet-and-block-system, the eighteenth-century Japanese kumi, the Soviet cellstructure. In the extreme, the formal structure of power coincides, as it were,with the informal ebb and flow of influence by discussion, which is thus killedoff.By combining these several points, we can construct little models or diagrams ofseveral types of societies. Since ‘the problem of public opinion’ as we know itis set by the eclipse of the classic bourgeois public, we are here concernedwith only two types: public and mass.In a public, as we may understand the term, (1) virtually as many people expressopinions as receive them. (2) Public communications are so organized that thereis a chance immediately and effectively to answer back any opinion expressed inpublic. Opinion formed by such discussion (3) readily finds an outlet ineffective action, even against—if necessary—the prevailing system of authority.And (4) authoritative institutions do not penetrate the public, which is thusmore or less autonomous in its operations. When these conditions prevail, wehave the working model of a community of publics, and this model fits closelythe several assumptions of classic democratic theory.At the opposite extreme, in a mass, (1) far fewer people express opinions thanreceive them; for the community of publics becomes an abstract collection ofindividuals who receive impressions from the mass media. (2) The communicationsthat prevail are so organized that it is difficult or impossible for theindividual to answer back immediately or with any effect. (3) The realization ofopinion in action is controlled by authorities who organize and control thechannels of such action. (4) The mass has no autonomy from institutions; on thecontrary, agents of authorized institutions penetrate this mass, reducing anyautonomy it may have in the formation of opinion by discussion.The public and the mass may be most readily distinguished by their dominantmodes of communication: in a community of publics, discussion is the ascendantmeans of communication, and the mass media, if they exist, simply enlarge andanimate discussion, linking one primary public with the discussions of another.In a mass society, the dominant type of communication is the formal media, andthe publics become mere media markets: all those exposed to the contents ofgiven mass media.3From almost any angle of vision that we might assume, when we look upon thepublic, we realize that we have moved a considerable distance along the road tothe mass society. At the end of that road there is totalitarianism, as in NaziGermany or in Communist Russia. We are not yet at that end. In the United Statestoday, media markets are not entirely ascendant over primary publics. But surelywe can see that many aspects of the public life of our times are more thefeatures of a mass society than of a community of publics.What is happening might again be stated in terms of the historical parallelbetween the economic market and the public of public opinion. In brief, there isa movement from widely scattered little powers to concentrated powers and theattempt at monopoly control from powerful centers, which, being partiallyhidden, are centers of manipulation as well as of authority. The small shopserving the neighborhood is replaced by the anonymity of the nationalcorporation: mass advertisement replaces the personal influence of opinionbetween merchant and customer. The political leader hooks up his speech to anational network and speaks, with appropriate personal touches, to a millionpeople he never saw and never will see. Entire brackets of professions andindustries are in the ‘opinion business,’ impersonally manipulating the publicfor hire.In the primary public the competition of opinions goes on between people holdingviews in the service of their interests and their reasoning. But in the masssociety of media markets, competition, if any, goes on between the manipulatorswith their mass media on the one hand, and the people receiving their propagandaon the other.Under such conditions, it is not surprising that there should arise a conceptionof public opinion as a mere reaction—we cannot say ‘response’—to the content ofthe mass media. In this view, the public is merely the collectivity ofindividuals each rather passively exposed to the mass media and ratherhelplessly opened up to the suggestions and manipulations that flow from thesemedia. The fact of manipulation from centralized points of control constitutes,as it were, an expropriation of the old multitude of little opinion producersand consumers operating in a free and balanced market.In official circles, the very term itself, ‘the public’—as Walter Lippmann notedthirty years ago—has come to have a phantom meaning, which dramatically revealsits eclipse. From the standpoint of the deciding elite, some of those who clamorpublicly can be identified as ‘Labor,’ others as ‘Business,’ still others as‘Farmer.’ Those who can not readily be so identified make up ‘The Public.’ Inthis usage, the public is composed of the unidentified and the non-partisan in aworld of defined and partisan interests. It is socially composed ofwell-educated salaried professionals, especially college professors; ofnon-unionized employees, especially white-collar people, along withself-employed professionals and small businessmen.In this faint echo of the classic notion, the public consists of those remnantsof the middle classes, old and new, whose interests are not explicitly defined,organized, or clamorous. In a curious adaptation, ‘the public’ often becomes, infact, ‘the unattached expert,’ who, although well informed, has never taken aclear-cut, public stand on controversial issues which are brought to a focus byorganized interests. These are the ‘public’ members of the board, thecommission, the committee. What the public stands for, accordingly, is often avagueness of policy (called open-mindedness), a lack of involvement in publicaffairs (known as reasonableness), and a professional disinterest (known astolerance).Some such official members of the public, as in the field of labor-managementmediation, start out very young and make a career out of being careful to beinformed but never taking a strong position; and there are many others, quiteunofficial, who take such professionals as a sort of model. The only trouble isthat they are acting as if they were disinterested judges but they do not havethe power of judges; hence their reasonableness, their tolerance, and theiropen-mindedness do not often count for much in the shaping of human affairs.4All those trends that make for the decline of the politician and of hisbalancing society bear decisively upon the transformation of public into mass.*[page_306.html#pg306fn1a] One of the most important of the structuraltransformations involved is the decline of the voluntary association as agenuine instrument of the public. As we have already seen, the executiveascendancy in economic, military, and political institutions has lowered theeffective use of all those voluntary associations which operate between thestate and the economy on the one hand, and the family and the individual in theprimary group on the other. It is not only that institutions of power havebecome large-scale and inaccessibly centralized; they have at the same timebecome less political and more administrative, and it is within this greatchange of framework that the organized public has waned.In terms of scale, the transformation of public into mass has been underpinnedby the shift from a political public decisively restricted in size (by propertyand education, as well as by sex and age) to a greatly enlarged mass having onlythe qualifications of citizenship and age.In terms of organization, the transformation has been underpinned by the shiftfrom the individual and his primary community to the voluntary association andthe mass party as the major units of organized power.Voluntary associations have become larger to the extent that they have becomeeffective; and to just that extent they have become inaccessible to theindividual who would shape by discussion the policies of the organization towhich he belongs. Accordingly, along with older institutions, these voluntaryassociations have lost their grip on the individual. As more people are drawninto the political arena, these associations become mass in scale; and as thepower of the individual becomes more dependent upon such mass associations, theyare less accessible to the individual’s influence.* [page_307.html#pg307fn1a]Mass democracy means the struggle of powerful and large-scale interest groupsand associations, which stand between the big decisions that are made by state,corporation, army, and the will of the individual citizen as a member of thepublic. Since these middle-level associations are the citizen’s major link withdecision, his relation to them is of decisive importance. For it is only throughthem that he exercises such power as he may have.The gap between the members and the leaders of the mass association is becomingincreasingly wider. As soon as a man gets to be a leader of an association largeenough to count he readily becomes lost as an instrument of that association. Hedoes so (1) in the interests of maintaining his leading position in, or ratherover, his mass association, and he does so (2) because he comes to see himselfnot as a mere delegate, instructed or not, of the mass association herepresents, but as a member of ‘an elite’ composed of such men as himself. Thesefacts, in turn, lead to (3) the big gap between the terms in which issues aredebated and resolved among members of this elite, and the terms in which theyare presented to the members of the various mass associations. For the decisionsthat are made must take into account those who are important-other elites—butthey must be sold to the mass memberships.The gap between speaker and listener, between power and public, leads less toany iron law of oligarchy than to the law of spokesmanship: as the pressuregroup expands, its leaders come to organize the opinions they ‘represent.’ Soelections, as we have seen, become contests between two giant and unwieldyparties, neither of which the individual can truly feel that he influences, andneither of which is capable of winning psychologically impressive or politicallydecisive majorities. And, in all this, the parties are of the same general formas other mass associations.2 [ch15_notes.html#ch13en2]When we say that man in the mass is without any sense of political belonging, wehave in mind a political fact rather than merely a style of feeling. We have inmind (I.) a certain way of belonging (II.) to a certain kind of organization.I. The way of belonging here implied rests upon a belief in the purposes and inthe leaders of an organization, and thus enables men and women freely to be athome within it. To belong in this way is to make the human association apsychological center of one’s self, to take into our conscience, deliberatelyand freely, its rules of conduct and its purposes, which we thus shape and whichin turn shape us. We do not have this kind of belonging to any politicalorganization.II. The kind of organization we have in mind is a voluntary association whichhas three decisive characteristics: first, it is a context in which reasonableopinions may be formulated; second, it is an agency by which reasonableactivities may be undertaken; and third, it is a powerful enough unit, incomparison with other organizations of power, to make a difference.It is because they do not find available associations at once psychologicallymeaningful and historically effective that men often feel uneasy in theirpolitical and economic loyalties. The effective units of power are now the hugecorporation, the inaccessible government, the grim military establishment.Between these, on the one hand, and the family and the small community on theother, we find no intermediate associations in which men feel secure and withwhich they feel powerful. There is little live political struggle. Instead,there is administration from above, and the political vacuum below. The primarypublics are now either so small as to be swamped, and hence give up; or so largeas to be merely another feature of the generally distant structure of power, andhence inaccessible.Public opinion exists when people who are not in the government of a countryclaim the right to express political opinions freely and publicly, and the rightthat these opinions should influence or determine the policies, personnel, andactions of their government.3 [ch15_notes.html#ch13en3] In this formal sensethere has been and there is a definite public opinion in the United States. Andyet, with modern developments this formal right—when it does still exist as aright—does not mean what it once did. The older world of voluntary organizationwas as different from the world of the mass organization, as was Tom Paine’sworld of pamphleteering from the world of the mass media.Since the French Revolution, conservative thinkers have Viewed With Alarm therise of the public, which they called the masses, or something to that effect.‘The populace is sovereign, and the tide of barbarism mounts,’ wrote Gustave LeBon. ‘The divine right of the masses is about to replace the divine right ofkings,’ and already ‘the destinies of nations are elaborated at present in theheart of the masses, and no longer in the councils of princes.’4[ch15_notes.html#ch13en4] During the twentieth century, liberal and evensocialist thinkers have followed suit, with more explicit reference to what wehave called the society of masses. From Le Bon to Emil Lederer and Ortega yGasset, they have held that the influence of the mass in unfortunatelyincreasing.But surely those who have supposed the masses to be all powerful, or at leastwell on their way to triumph, are wrong. In our time, as Chakhotin knew, theinfluence of autonomous collectivities within political life is in factdiminishing.5 [ch15_notes.html#ch13en5] Furthermore, such influence as they dohave is guided; they must now be seen not as publics acting autonomously, but asmasses manipulated at focal points into crowds of demonstrators. For as publicsbecome masses, masses sometimes become crowds; and, in crowds, the psychicalrape by the mass media is supplemented up-close by the harsh and suddenharangue. Then the people in the crowd disperse again—as atomized and submissivemasses.In all modern societies, the autonomous associations standing between thevarious classes and the state tend to lose their effectiveness as vehicles ofreasoned opinion and instruments for the rational exertion of political will.Such associations can be deliberately broken up and thus turned into passiveinstruments of rule, or they can more slowly wither away from lack of use in theface of centralized means of power. But whether they are destroyed in a week, orwither in a generation, such associations are replaced in virtually every sphereof life by centralized organizations, and it is such organizations with alltheir new means of power that take charge of the terrorized or—as the case maybe—merely intimidated, society of masses.5The institutional trends that make for a society of masses are to a considerableextent a matter of impersonal drift, but the remnants of the public are alsoexposed to more ‘personal’ and intentional forces. With the broadening of thebase of politics within the context of a folk-lore of democraticdecision-making, and with the increased means of mass persuasion that areavailable, the public of public opinion has become the object of intensiveefforts to control, manage, manipulate, and increasingly intimidate.In political, military, economic realms, power becomes, in varying degrees,uneasy before the suspected opinions of masses, and, accordingly, opinion-makingbecomes an accepted technique of power-holding and power-getting. The minorityelectorate of the propertied and the educated is replaced by the totalsuffrage—and intensive campaigns for the vote. The small eighteenth-centuryprofessional army is replaced by the mass army of conscripts—and by the problemsof nationalist morale. The small shop is replaced by the mass-productionindustry—and the national advertisement.As the scale of institutions has become larger and more centralized, so has therange and intensity of the opinion-makers’ efforts. The means of opinion-making,in fact, have paralleled in range and efficiency the other institutions ofgreater scale that cradle the modern society of masses. Accordingly, in additionto their enlarged and centralized means of administration, exploitation, andviolence, the modern elite have had placed within their grasp historicallyunique instruments of psychic management and manipulation, which includeuniversal compulsory education as well as the media of mass communication.Early observers believed that the increase in the range and volume of the formalmeans of communication would enlarge and animate the primary public. In suchoptimistic views—written before radio and television and movies—the formal mediaare understood as simply multiplying the scope and pace of personal discussion.Modern conditions, Charles Cooley wrote, ‘enlarge indefinitely the competitionof ideas, and whatever has owed its persistence merely to lack of comparison islikely to go, for that which is really congenial to the choosing mind will beall the more cherished and increased.’6 [ch15_notes.html#ch13en6] Still excitedby the break-up of the conventional consensus of the local community, he saw thenew means of communication as furthering the conversational dynamic of classicdemocracy, and with it the growth of rational and free individuality.No one really knows all the functions of the mass media, for in their entiretythese functions are probably so pervasive and so subtle that they cannot becaught by the means of social research now available. But we do now have reasonto believe that these media have helped less to enlarge and animate thediscussions of primary publics than to transform them into a set of mediamarkets in mass-like society. I do not refer merely to the higher ratio ofdeliverers of opinion to receivers and to the decreased chance to answer back;nor do I refer merely to the violent banalization and stereotyping of our verysense organs in terms of which these media now compete for ‘attention.’ I havein mind a sort of psychological illiteracy that is facilitated by the media, andthat is expressed in several ways:I. Very little of what we think we know of the social realities of the worldhave we found out first-hand. Most of ‘the pictures in our heads’ we have gainedfrom these media—even to the point where we often do not really believe what wesee before us until we read about it in the paper or hear about it on theradio.7 [ch15_notes.html#ch13en7] The media not only give us information; theyguide our very experiences. Our standards of credulity, our standards ofreality, tend to be set by these media rather than by our own fragmentaryexperience.Accordingly, even if the individual has direct, personal experience of events,it is not really direct and primary: it is organized in stereotypes. It takeslong and skillful training to so uproot such stereotypes that an individual seesthings freshly, in an unstereotyped manner. One might suppose, for example, thatif all the people went through a depression they would all ‘experience it,’ andin terms of this experience, that they would all debunk or reject or at leastrefract what the media say about it. But experience of such a structural shifthas to be organized and interpreted if it is to count in the making of opinion.The kind of experience, in short, that might serve as a basis for resistance tomass media is not an experience of raw events, but the experience of meanings.The fleck of interpretation must be there in the experience if we are to use theword experience seriously. And the capacity for such experience is sociallyimplanted. The individual does not trust his own experience, as I have said,until it is confirmed by others or by the media. Usually such direct exposure isnot accepted if it disturbs loyalties and beliefs that the individual alreadyholds. To be accepted, it must relieve or justify the feelings that often lie inthe back of his mind as key features of his ideological loyalties.Stereotypes of loyalty underlie beliefs and feelings about given symbols andemblems; they are the very ways in which men see the social world and in termsof which men make up their specific opinions and views of events. They are theresults of previous experience, which affect present and future experience. Itgoes without saying that men are often unaware of these loyalties, that oftenthey could not formulate them explicitly. Yet such general stereotypes make forthe acceptance or the rejection of specific opinions not so much by the force oflogical consistency as by their emotional affinity and by the way in which theyrelieve anxieties. To accept opinions in their terms is to gain the good solidfeeling of being correct without having to think. When ideological stereotypesand specific opinions are linked in this way, there is a lowering of the kind ofanxiety which arises when loyalty and belief are not in accord. Such ideologieslead to a willingness to accept a given line of belief; then there is no need,emotionally or rationally, to overcome resistance to given items in that line;cumulative selections of specific opinions and feelings become the pre-organizedattitudes and emotions that shape the opinion-life of the person.These deeper beliefs and feelings are a sort of lens through which menexperience their worlds, they strongly condition acceptance or rejection ofspecific opinions, and they set men’s orientation toward prevailing authorities.Three decades ago, Walter Lippmann saw such prior convictions as biases: theykept men from defining reality in an adequate way. They are still biases. Buttoday they can often be seen as ‘good biases’; inadequate and misleading as theyoften are, they are less so than the crackpot realism of the higher authoritiesand opinion-makers. They are the lower common sense and as such a factor ofresistance. But we must recognize, especially when the pace of change is so deepand fast, that common sense is more often common than sense. And, above all, wemust recognize that ‘the common sense’ of our children is going to be less theresult of any firm social tradition than of the stereotypes carried by the massmedia to which they are now so fully exposed. They are the first generation tobe so exposed.II. So long as the media are not entirely monopolized, the individual can playone medium off against another; he can compare them, and hence resist what anyone of them puts out. The more genuine competition there is among the media, themore resistance the individual might be able to command. But how much is thisnow the case? Do people compare reports on public events or policies, playingone medium’s content off against another’s?The answer is: generally no, very few do: (I) We know that people tend stronglyto select those media which carry contents with which they already agree. Thereis a kind of selection of new opinions on the basis of prior opinions. No oneseems to search out such counter-statements as may be found in alternative mediaofferings. Given radio programs and magazines and newspapers often get a ratherconsistent public, and thus reinforce their messages in the minds of thatpublic. (2) This idea of playing one medium off against another assumes that themedia really have varying contents. It assumes genuine competition, which is notwidely true. The media display an apparent variety and competition, but oncloser view they seem to compete more in terms of variations on a fewstandardized themes than of clashing issues. The freedom to raise issueseffectively seems more and more to be confined to those few interests that haveready and continual access to these media.III. The media have not only filtered into our experience of external realities,they have also entered into our very experience of our own selves. They haveprovided us with new identities and new aspirations of what we should like tobe, and what we should like to appear to be. They have provided in the models ofconduct they hold out to us a new and larger and more flexible set of appraisalsof our very selves. In terms of the modern theory of the self,8[ch15_notes.html#ch13en8] we may say that the media bring the reader, listener,viewer into the sight of larger, higher reference groups—groups, real orimagined, up-close or vicarious, personally known or distractedly glimpsed—whichare looking glasses for his self-image. They have multiplied the groups to whichwe look for confirmation of our self-image.More than that: (1) the media tell the man in the mass who he is—they give himidentity; (2) they tell him what he wants to be—they give him aspirations; (3)they tell him how to get that way—they give him technique; and (4) they tell himhow to feel that he is that way even when he is not—they give him escape. Thegaps between the identity and aspiration lead to technique and/or to escape.That is probably the basic psychological formula of the mass media today. But,as a formula, it is not attuned to the development of the human being. It is theformula of a pseudo-world which the media invent and sustain.IV. As they now generally prevail, the mass media, especially television, oftenencroach upon the small-scale discussion, and destroy the chance for thereasonable and leisurely and human interchange of opinion. They are an importantcause of the destruction of privacy in its full human meaning. That is animportant reason why they not only fail as an educational force, but are amalign force: they do not articulate for the viewer or listener the broadersources of his private tensions and anxieties, his inarticulate resentments andhalf-formed hopes. They neither enable the individual to transcend his narrowmilieu nor clarify its private meaning.The media provide much information and news about what is happening in theworld, but they do not often enable the listener or the viewer truly to connecthis daily life with these larger realities. They do not connect the informationthey provide on public issues with the troubles felt by the individual. They donot increase rational insight into tensions, either those in the individual orthose of the society which are reflected in the individual. On the contrary,they distract him and obscure his chance to understand himself or his world, byfastening his attention upon artificial frenzies that are resolved within theprogram framework, usually by violent action or by what is called humor. Inshort, for the viewer they are not really resolved at all. The chief distractingtension of the media is between the wanting and the not having of commodities orof women held to be good looking. There is almost always the general tone ofanimated distraction, of suspended agitation, but it is going nowhere and it hasnowhere to go.But the media, as now organized and operated, are even more than a major causeof the transformation of America into a mass society. They are also among themost important of those increased means of power now at the disposal of elitesof wealth and power; morever, some of the higher agents of these media arethemselves either among the elites or very important among their servants.Alongside or just below the elite, there is the propagandist, the publicityexpert, the public-relations man, who would control the very formation of publicopinion in order to be able to include it as one more pacified item incalculations of effective power, increased prestige, more secure wealth. Overthe last quarter of a century, the attitudes of these manipulators toward theirtask have gone through a sort of dialectic:In the beginning, there is great faith in what the mass media can do. Words winwars or sell soap; they move people, they restrain people. ‘Only cost,’ theadvertising man of the ‘twenties proclaims, ‘limits the delivery of publicopinion in any direction on any topic.’9 [ch15_notes.html#ch13en9] Theopinion-maker’s belief in the media as mass persuaders almost amounts tomagic—but he can believe mass communications omnipotent only so long as thepublic is trustful. It does not remain trustful. The mass media say so very manyand such competitively exaggerated things; they banalize their message and theycancel one another out. The ‘propaganda phobia,’ in reaction to wartime lies andpostwar disenchantment, does not help matters, even though memory is both shortand subject to official distortion. This distrust of the magic of media istranslated into a slogan among the opinion managers. Across their banners theywrite: ‘Mass Persuasion Is Not Enough.’Frustrated, they reason; and reasoning, they come to accept the principle ofsocial context. To change opinion and activity, they say to one another, we mustpay close attention to the full context and lives of the people to be managed.Along with mass persuasion, we must somehow use personal influence; we mustreach people in their life context and through other people, their dailyassociates, those whom they trust: we must get at them by some kind of‘personal’ persuasion. We must not show our hand directly; rather than merelyadvise or command, we must manipulate.Now this live and immediate social context in which people live and which exertsa steady expectation upon them is of course what we have called the primarypublic. Anyone who has seen the inside of an advertising agency orpublic-relations office knows that the primary public is still the greatunsolved problem of the opinion-makers. Negatively, their recognition of theinfluence of social context upon opinion and public activity implies that thearticulate public resists and refracts the communications of the mass media.Positively, this recognition implies that the public is not composed of isolatedindividuals, but rather of persons who not only have prior opinions that must bereckoned with, but who continually influence each other in complex and intimate,in direct and continual ways.In their attempts to neutralize or to turn to their own use the articulatepublic, the opinion-makers try to make it a relay network for their views. Ifthe opinion-makers have so much power that they can act directly and openly uponthe primary publics, they may become authoritative; but, if they do not havesuch power and hence have to operate indirectly and without visibility, theywill assume the stance of manipulators.Authority is power that is explicit and more or less ‘voluntarily’ obeyed;manipulation is the ‘secret’ exercise of power, unknown to those who areinfluenced. In the model of the classic democratic society, manipulation is nota problem, because formal authority resides in the public itself and in itsrepresentatives who are made or broken by the public. In the completelyauthoritarian society, manipulation is not a problem, because authority isopenly identified with the ruling institutions and their agents, who may useauthority explicitly and nakedly. They do not, in the extreme case, have to gainor retain power by hiding its exercise.Manipulation becomes a problem wherever men have power that is concentrated andwillful but do not have authority, or when, for any reason, they do not wish touse their power openly. Then the powerful seek to rule without showing theirpowerfulness. They want to rule, as it were, secretly, without publicizedlegitimation. It is in this mixed case—as in the intermediate reality of theAmerican today—that manipulation is a prime way of exercising power. Smallcircles of men are making decisions which they need to have at least authorizedby indifferent or recalcitrant people over whom they do not exercise explicitauthority. So the small circle tries to manipulate these people into willingacceptance or cheerful support of their decisions or opinions—or at least to therejection of possible counter-opinions.Authority formally resides ‘in the people,’ but the power of initiation is infact held by small circles of men. That is why the standard strategy ofmanipulation is to make it appear that the people, or at least a large group ofthem, ‘really made the decision.’ That is why even when the authority isavailable, men with access to it may still prefer the secret, quieter ways ofmanipulation.But are not the people now more educated? Why not emphasize the spread ofeducation rather than the increased effects of the mass media? The answer, inbrief, is that mass education, in many respects, has become—another mass medium.The prime task of public education, as it came widely to be understood in thiscountry, was political: to make the citizen more knowledgeable and thus betterable to think and to judge of public affairs. In time, the function of educationshifted from the political to the economic: to train people for better-payingjobs and thus to get ahead. This is especially true of the high-school movement,which has met the business demands for white-collar skills at the public’sexpense. In large part education has become merely vocational; in so far as itspolitical task is concerned, in many schools, that has been reduced to a routinetraining of nationalist loyalties.The training of skills that are of more or less direct use in the vocationallife is an important task to perform, but ought not to be mistaken for liberaleducation: job advancement, no matter on what levels, is not the same asself-development, although the two are now systematically confused.10[ch15_notes.html#ch13en10] Among ‘skills,’ some are more and some are lessrelevant to the aims of liberal—that is to say, liberating—education. Skills andvalues cannot be so easily separated as the academic search for supposedlyneutral skills causes us to assume. And especially not when we speak seriouslyof liberal education. Of course, there is a scale, with skills at one end andvalues at the other, but it is the middle range of this scale, which one mightcall sensibilities, that are of most relevance to the classic public.To train someone to operate a lathe or to read and write is pretty mucheducation of skill; to evoke from people an understanding of what they reallywant out of their lives or to debate with them stoic, Christian and humanistways of living, is pretty much a clear-cut education of values. But to assist inthe birth among a group of people of those cultural and political and technicalsensibilities which would make them genuine members of a genuinely liberalpublic, this is at once a training in skills and an education of values. Itincludes a sort of therapy in the ancient sense of clarifying one’s knowledge ofone’s self; it includes the imparting of all those skills of controversy withone’s self, which we call thinking; and with others, which we call debate. Andthe end product of such liberal education of sensibilities is simply theself-educating, self-cultivating man or woman.The knowledgeable man in the genuine public is able to turn his personaltroubles into social issues, to see their relevance for his community and hiscommunity’s relevance for them. He understands that what he thinks and feels aspersonal troubles are very often not only that but problems shared by others andindeed not subject to solution by any one individual but only by modificationsof the structure of the groups in which he lives and sometimes the structure ofthe entire society.Men in masses are gripped by personal troubles, but they are not aware of theirtrue meaning and source. Men in public confront issues, and they are aware oftheir terms. It is the task of the liberal institution, as of the liberallyeducated man, continually to translate troubles into issues and issues into theterms of their human meaning for the individual. In the absence of deep and widepolitical debate, schools for adults and adolescents could perhaps becomehospitable frameworks for just such debate. In a community of publics the taskof liberal education would be: to keep the public from being overwhelmed; tohelp produce the disciplined and informed mind that cannot be overwhelmed; tohelp develop the bold and sensible individual that cannot be sunk by the burdensof mass life. But educational practice has not made knowledge directly relevantto the human need of the troubled person of the twentieth century or to thesocial practices of the citizen. This citizen cannot now see the roots of hisown biases and frustrations, nor think clearly about himself, nor for thatmatter about anything else. He does not see the frustration of idea, ofintellect, by the present organization of society, and he is not able to meetthe tasks now confronting ‘the intelligent citizen.’Educational institutions have not done these things and, except in rareinstances, they are not doing them. They have become mere elevators ofoccupational and social ascent, and, on all levels, they have become politicallytimid. Moreover, in the hands of ‘professional educators,’ many schools havecome to operate on an ideology of ‘life adjustment’ that encourages happyacceptance of mass ways of life rather than the struggle for individual andpublic transcendence.* [page_319.html#pg319fn1a]There is not much doubt that modern regressive educators have adapted theirnotions of educational content and practice to the idea of the mass. They do noteffectively proclaim standards of cultural level and intellectual rigor; ratherthey often deal in the trivia of vocational tricks and ‘adjustment tolife’—meaning the slack life of masses. ‘Democratic schools’ often mean thefurtherance of intellectual mediocrity, vocational training, nationalisticloyalties, and little else.6The structural trends of modern society and the manipulative character of itscommunication technique come to a point of coincidence in the mass society,which is largely a metropolitan society. The growth of the metropolis,segregating men and women into narrowed routines and environments, causes themto lose any firm sense of their integrity as a public. The members of publics insmaller communities know each other more or less fully, because they meet in theseveral aspects of the total life routine. The members of masses in ametropolitan society know one another only as fractions in specialized milieux:the man who fixes the car, the girl who serves your lunch, the saleslady, thewomen who take care of your child at school during the day. Prejudgment andstereotype flourish when people meet in such ways. The human reality of othersdoes not, cannot, come through.People, we know, tend to select those formal media which confirm what theyalready believe and enjoy. In a parallel way, they tend in the metropolitansegregation to come into live touch with those whose opinions are similar totheirs. Others they tend to treat unseriously. In the metropolitan society theydevelop, in their defense, a blasé manner that reaches deeper than a manner.They do not, accordingly, experience genuine clashes of viewpoint, genuineissues. And when they do, they tend to consider it mere rudeness.Sunk in their routines, they do not transcend, even by discussion, much less byaction, their more or less narrow lives. They do not gain a view of thestructure of their society and of their role as a public within it. The city isa structure composed of such little environments, and the people in them tend tobe detached from one another. The ‘stimulating variety’ of the city does notstimulate the men and women of ‘the bedroom belt,’ the one-class suburbs, whocan go through life knowing only their own kind. If they do reach for oneanother, they do so only through stereotypes and prejudiced images of thecreatures of other milieux. Each is trapped by his confining circle; each is cutoff from easily identifiable groups. It is for people in such narrow milieuxthat the mass media can create a pseudo-world beyond, and a pseudo-world withinthemselves as well.Publics live in milieux but they can transcend them—individually by intellectualeffort; socially by public action. By reflection and debate and by organizedaction, a community of publics comes to feel itself and comes in fact to beactive at points of structural relevance.But members of a mass exist in milieux and cannot get out of them, either bymind or by activity, except—in the extreme case-under ‘the organizedspontaneity’ of the bureaucrat on a motorcycle. We have not yet reached theextreme case, but observing metropolitan man in the American mass we can surelysee the psychological preparations for it.We may think of it in this way: When a handful of men do not have jobs, and donot seek work, we look for the causes in their immediate situation andcharacter. But when twelve million men are unemployed, then we cannot believethat all of them suddenly ‘got lazy’ and turned out to be ‘no good.’ Economistscall this ‘structural unemployment’—meaning, for one thing, that the meninvolved cannot themselves control their job chances. Structural unemploymentdoes not originate in one factory or in one town, nor is it due to anything thatone factory or one town does or fails to do. Moreover, there is little ornothing that one ordinary man in one factory in one town can do about it when itsweeps over his personal milieu.Now, this distinction, between social structure and personal milieu, is one ofthe most important available in the sociological studies. It offers us a readyunderstanding of the position of ‘the public’ in America today. In every majorarea of life, the loss of a sense of structure and the submergence intopowerless milieux is the cardinal fact. In the military it is most obvious, forhere the roles men play are strictly confining; only the command posts at thetop afford a view of the structure of the whole, and moreover, this view is aclosely guarded official secret. In the division of labor too, the jobs menenact in the economic hierarchies are also more or less narrow milieux and thepositions from which a view of the production process as a whole can be had arecentralized, as men are alienated not only from the product and the tools oftheir labor, but from any understanding of the structure and the processes ofproduction. In the political order, in the fragmentation of the lower and in thedistracting proliferation of the middle-level organization, men cannot see thewhole, cannot see the top, and cannot state the issues that will in factdetermine the whole structure in which they live and their place within it.This loss of any structural view or position is the decisive meaning of thelament over the loss of community. In the great city, the division of milieuxand of segregating routines reaches the point of closest contact with theindividual and the family, for, although the city is not the unit of primedecision, even the city cannot be seen as a total structure by most of itscitizens.On the one hand, there is the increased scale and centralization of thestructure of decision; and, on the other, the increasingly narrow sorting out ofmen into milieux. From both sides, there is the increased dependence upon theformal media of communication, including those of education itself. But the manin the mass does not gain a transcending view from these media; instead he getshis experience stereotyped, and then he gets sunk further by that experience. Hecannot detach himself in order to observe, much less to evaluate, what he isexperiencing, much less what he is not experiencing. Rather than that internaldiscussion we call reflection, he is accompanied through his life-experiencewith a sort of unconscious, echoing monologue. He has no projects of his own: hefulfills the routines that exist. He does not transcend whatever he is at anymoment, because he does not, he cannot, transcend his daily milieux. He is nottruly aware of his own daily experience and of its actual standards: he drifts,he fulfills habits, his behavior a result of a planless mixture of the confusedstandards and the uncriticized expectations that he has taken over from otherswhom he no longer really knows or trusts, if indeed he ever really did.He takes things for granted, he makes the best of them, he tries to look ahead—ayear or two perhaps, or even longer if he has children or a mortgage—but he doesnot seriously ask, What do I want? How can I get it? A vague optimism suffusesand sustains him, broken occasionally by little miseries and disappointmentsthat are soon buried. He is smug, from the standpoint of those who thinksomething might be the matter with the mass style of life in the metropolitanfrenzy where self-making is an externally busy branch of industry. By whatstandards does he judge himself and his efforts? What is really important tohim? Where are the models of excellence for this man?He loses his independence, and more importantly, he loses the desire to beindependent: in fact, he does not have hold of the idea of being an independentindividual with his own mind and his own worked-out way of life. It is not thathe likes or does not like this life; it is that the question does not come upsharp and clear so he is not bitter and he is not sweet about conditions andevents. He thinks he wants merely to get his share of what is around with aslittle trouble as he can and with as much fun as possible.Such order and movement as his life possesses is in conformity with externalroutines; otherwise his day-to-day experience is a vague chaos—although he oftendoes not know it because, strictly speaking, he does not truly possess orobserve his own experience. He does not formulate his desires; they areinsinuated into him. And, in the mass, he loses the self-confidence of the humanbeing—if indeed he has ever had it. For life in a society of masses implantsinsecurity and furthers impotence; it makes men uneasy and vaguely anxious; itisolates the individual from the solid group; it destroys firm group standards.Acting without goals, the man in the mass just feels pointless.The idea of a mass society suggests the idea of an elite of power. The idea ofthe public, in contrast, suggests the liberal tradition of a society without anypower elite, or at any rate with shifting elites of no sovereign consequence.For, if a genuine public is sovereign, it needs no master; but the masses, intheir full development, are sovereign only in some plebiscitarian moment ofadulation to an elite as authoritative celebrity. The political structure of ademocratic state requires the public; and, the democratic man, in his rhetoric,must assert that this public is the very seat of sovereignty.But now, given all those forces that have enlarged and centralized the politicalorder and made modern societies less political and more administrative; giventhe transformation of the old middle classes into something which perhaps shouldnot even be called middle class; given all the mass communications that do nottruly communicate; given all the metropolitan segregation that is not community;given the absence of voluntary associations that really connect the public atlarge with the centers of power—what is happening is the decline of a set ofpublics that is sovereign only in the most formal and rhetorical sense.Moreover, in many countries the remnants of such publics as remain are now beingfrightened out of existence. They lose their will for rationally considereddecision and action because they do not possess the instruments for suchdecision and action; they lose their, sense of political belonging because theydo not belong; they lose their political will because they see no way to realizeit.The top of modern American society is increasingly unified, and often seemswillfully co-ordinated: at the top there has emerged an elite of power. Themiddle levels are a drifting set of stalemated, balancing forces: the middledoes not link the bottom with the top. The bottom of this society is politicallyfragmented, and even as a passive fact, increasingly powerless: at the bottomthere is emerging a mass society."},{"pageContent":"14THE CONSERVATIVE MOODIF we are to suppose that modern America ought to be a democratic society, wemust look to the intellectual community for knowledge of the power elite and oftheir decisions. For democracy implies that those who bear the consequences ofdecisions have enough knowledge—not to speak of power—to hold thedecision-makers accountable. Everyone must depend upon knowledge provided byothers, for no man can know by his own experience more than a small portion ofthe social worlds that now affect him. Most of our experience is indirect and,as we have seen, subject to much distortion. The opinion-makers of every agehave provided images of the elite of their time and place. Like the realitiesthey are supposed to represent, these images change; in our own immediate time,in fact, many old images have been revised and many new ones invented.Of late, this work has occurred less as an effort to know reality better than toserve a strangely conservative mood that has come to prevail among theimage-makers. The images they now offer us are not those of an elite inirresponsible command of unprecedented means of power and manipulation, but of ascatter of reasonable men overwhelmed by events and doing their best in adifficult situation. The mood out of which these images have arisen serves lessto justify the real power of the real elite, or the intelligence of itsdecisions, than to sustain their spokesmen. The images we are expected to takemost seriously are either irrelevant to the facts of power and of the powerelite or they are simply private fantasies serving more as emotional cushionsfor small coteries of comfortable writers, paid and unpaid, than as a diagram ofall those forces which in our time come to such obvious climax in the Americanpower elite.Yet scholars, knowingly and unknowingly, have been seeking suitable ideas aboutthis elite. They have not found them and they have not managed to create them.What they have found is an absence of mind and of morality in the public life ofour times, and what they have managed to create is a mere elaboration of theirown conservative mood. It is a mood quite appropriate to men living in amaterial boom, a nationalist celebration, a political vacuum. At its heart thereis a knowledge of powerlessness without poignancy, and a feeling of pseudo-powerbased on mere smugness. By its softening of the political will, this moodenables men to accept public depravity without any private sense of outrage, andto give up the central goal of western humanism, so strongly felt innineteenth-century American experience: the presumptuous control by reason ofman’s fate.1Those who grope for ideologies with which to explain their conservative moodwould anchor this mood—as well as themselves—in some solid tradition. They feelthat they have somehow been tricked by liberalism, progressivism, radicalism,and they are a little frightened. What many of them want, it would seem, is asociety of classic conservatism.Conservatism in its classic form is of course traditionalism becomeself-conscious and elaborated, argumentative and rationalized.1[ch15_notes.html#ch14en1] It also involves some ‘natural aristocracy.’ Sooner orlater all those who relax the grand tension of human rationality must take upthe neo-Burkeian defense of a traditional elite, for in the end, such an eliteis the major premise of a genuinely conservative ideology.The more explicit—and hence the less successful—attempts to find or to invent atraditional elite for America today seem upon examination to be merely hopefulassertions, and as little relevant to modern realities as they are usable guidesto political conduct. The conservative—Mr. Russell Kirk tells us—believes that(1) ‘divine intent rules society,’ man being incapable of grasping by his reasonthe great forces that prevail. Accordingly, change must be slow, for ‘Providenceis the proper instrument for change,’ and the test of a statesman is his‘cognizance of the real tendency of Providential social forces.’ Theconservative (2) has an affection for ‘the variety and mystery of traditionallife,’ perhaps most of all because he believes that ‘tradition and soundprejudice’ check man’s presumptuous will and archaic impulse. Moreover (3),‘Society longs for leadership,’ and the conservative holds that there are‘natural distinctions’ among men which form a natural order of classes andpowers.2 [ch15_notes.html#ch14en2]Tradition is sacred; through it the real social tendencies of Providence aredisplayed; therefore, tradition must be our guide. Whatever is traditionalrepresents the accumulated wisdom of the ages, and more: it exists by ‘divineintent.’Naturally we must ask how we are to know which traditions are instruments ofProvidence? Which of the events and changes all around us are by divine intent?At what moment did the highly conscious contrivances of the Founding Fathersbecome traditional and thus sanctified? And must one believe that society in theUnited States—before the progressive movement and before the New Dealreforms—represented anything akin to what the classic conservative would callorders and classes based on ‘natural distinctions’? If not, then what and whereis the model which the classic conservative would have us cherish? And do thosewho now man the political and economic institutions of the United Statesrepresent the Providential intent which is sought? And how are we to know ifthey do or do not?The conservative defends the irrationality of tradition against the powers ofhuman reason; he denies the legitimacy of man’s attempt individually to controlhis own fate and collectively to build his own world. How then can he bring inreason as a means of choosing among traditions and men, as a means of decidingwhich changes are Providential and which are evil forces? He cannot provide anyrational guide in our choice of which leaders grasp Providence and act it outand which are reformers and levelers. There is within this view no guide-line tohelp us decide which contenders for this natural distinction are genuine.And yet the answer, although not always clear, is always there: if we do notdestroy the natural order of classes and the hierarchy of powers, we shall havesuperiors and leaders to tell us. If we uphold these natural distinctions, andin fact resuscitate older ones, the leaders will decide. In the end, the classicconservative is left with this single principle: the principle of gratefullyaccepting the leadership of some set of men whom he considers a sanctifiedelite. If such men were there for all to recognize, then the conservative couldat least be socially clear. Then the yearning for a classic tradition and aconservative hierarchy could be satisfied. For they would be visibly anchored inthe authority of an aristocracy, and this aristocracy would be tangible to thesenses as the very model of private conduct and public decision.It is just here that American publicists of the conservative mood have becomeembarrassed and confused. Their embarrassment is in part due to a fear ofconfronting the all-pervading liberal rhetoric; their confusion is mainly due totwo simple facts about the American upper classes in general, and the highercircles of power in particular:Those who are on high are not suitable as models of conservative excellence. Nordo they themselves uphold any ideology truly suitable for public use.The very rich in America have been culturally among the very poor; the onlykinds of experience for which they have been models are the material ones ofmoney-getting and money-keeping. Material success is their sole basis ofauthority. One might, of course, be nostalgic for the old families and theirlast resorts, but such images are not generally supposed to count for much,being more of a tinsel past than of the serious present. Alongside the old richand supplanting them are the synthetic celebrities of national glamour who oftenmake a virtue out of cultural poverty and political illiteracy. By their verynature the professional celebrities are transient figures of the mass means ofdistraction rather than people who carry the prestige of authority because theyembody the continuity of tradition. And of the new rich, the big rich of Texasare too unsophisticated, and the corporate rich too much involved in what weshall call the higher immorality. As for the chief executives of thecorporations, ideologies—conservative or otherwise—are much too fancy for them:besides, their hired men can and do talk easily in the liberal patter—why thenshould they take on the burden of conservative principles? Furthermore, is itnot virtually a condition of success in the American political economy that onelearn to use, and use frequently, the liberal rhetoric which is the commondenominator of all proper and successful spokesmanship?3[ch15_notes.html#ch14en3]There are, accordingly, no highly placed social figures whom conservativescholars might celebrate as models of excellence, who stand in contrast with theliberal confusion they would deplore, and who are ready, able, and eager toadopt new conservative creeds. There are no pre-capitalist, pre-liberal eliteswhich they can draw upon, even in fond remembrance; they cannot, as Europeanwriters have been able to do, contrast such holdovers from feudalism, howevermodified, with the vulgarity of the successful of capitalist society.Consequently, the greatest problem of the spokesmen for an American conservatismis simply to locate the set of people whose interests the conservative ideologywould serve, and who, in turn, would accept it. Classic conservativism hasrequired the spell of tradition among such surviving elements of pre-industrialsocieties as an aristocracy of noble men, a peasantry, a petty-bourgeoisie withguild inheritances; and these are precisely what America has never had. For inAmerica, the bourgeoisie has been predominant from its beginnings—in class, instatus, and in power. In America, there has not been and there can be noconservative ideology of the classic type.The high and the mighty in America espouse no acceptable conservative ideas andactually abhor conservative rhetoric. In so far as one can find a clue to thebasic impulse of conservative spokesmen, it is the attempt to sacrifice politicsas an autonomous sphere of men’s will to the free and arbitrary dominance ofcorporate institutions and their key personnel. They have no connection withthose fountainheads of modern conservative thought with which many Americanintellectuals have been so hopefully seeking to associate them. Neither Burkenor Locke is the source of such ideology as the American elite have found trulycongenial. Their ideological source is Horatio Alger.4 [ch15_notes.html#ch14en4]The maxims of work-and-win, of strive-and-succeed have sustained them in theirnoble game of grab. They have not elaborated such awareness of their newer powerinto any conscious ideology. They have not had to confront any opposition basedupon ideas that stand in challenging contrast to the liberal rhetoric which theytoo employ as standard public relations. Perhaps it is easiest to be‘conservative’ when there is no true sense of the conservative present as onealternative to what the future might be. If one cannot say that Americanconservatism, as represented by men of wealth and power, is unconsciousness,certainly conservatives are often happily unconscious.Accordingly, even less than the radical writers of the ’thirties haveconservative writers of the ’forties and ’fifties been in close touch with theleaders or policy-makers they would influence or justify.5[ch15_notes.html#ch14en5] On the right and in the center, public relations fillsany need for ‘ideology,’ and public relations are something you hire. Just now,the elite of wealth and power do not feel in need of any ideology, much less anideology of classic conservatism.Yet, despite this, one may go ahead and defend the American elite and the upperclasses in general and the system within which they are successful. This is nolonger so popular among writers who are neither hired publicists nor academichacks, although every little tendency or chance to follow it is promptly seizedupon by those who are. Moreover, notions of trusteeship are still well received,especially among the chief executives of the corporate world, and every week bypoll and by chart it is conclusively proved that the American economy is thevery best in the world. Such an explicit defense, however, does not satisfythose who yearn for classic conservatism; to be useful, such defense must makeout the elite as dynamic and hence no anchor for tradition. On the contrary, thecapitalist elite must always be composed of self-making men who smash traditionto rise to the top by strictly personal accomplishments.2If classic conservatism, anchored in a recognized elite, is not quite possibletoday in America, that does not mean that scholars with conservative yearningshave not found other ways to realize themselves. In their need for anaristocracy, they often become grandly vague about the aristocrat. Generalizingthe notion, they make it moral rather than socially firm and specific. In thename of ‘genuine democracy’ or ‘liberal conservatism’ they stretch the meaningof aristocracy—the ‘natural aristocracy’ has nothing to do with existing socialorders, classes, or hierarchies of power; the aristocracy becomes a scatter ofmorally superior persons rather than a socially recognizable class. Such notionsare now quite popular, for they satisfy the conservative mood without requiringallegiance to the current crop of ‘aristocrats.’ So it is with Ortega y Gassetand so it is with Peter Viereck. The latter, for example, writes that it is not‘the aristocratic class’ that is valuable but ‘the aristocratic spirit’—which,with its decorum and noblesse oblige, is ‘open to all, regardless of class.’6[ch15_notes.html#ch14en6] Some have tried to find a way to hold onto such aview, almost secretly, not stating it directly, but holding it as a latentassumption while talking about, not the elite, but ‘the mass.’ That, however, isdangerous, for again, it goes against the liberal rhetoric which requires acontinual flattery of the citizens.Generalizing the aristocratic ethos and emptying it of social content are notreally satisfactory because they provide no widely accepted criteria for judgingwho is elite and who is not. A self-selecting elite can be no anchor. Moreover,such a generalization does not have to do with the existing facts of power andhence is politically irrelevant.Both outright defense of those who are ascendant within the status quo, anddefense of an imaginary aristocratic ethos, in fact, end up not with an elitethat is fixed in tradition and hierarchy, but with a dynamic and ever-changingelite continually struggling to the top in an expanding society. There is simplyno socially, much less politically, recognized traditional elite and there is notradition that can be imaginatively elaborated around such an elite. Moreover,whatever else it may be, tradition is something one cannot create; one can onlyuphold it when it exists. There is today no magic spell of unbroken traditionupon which modern society is or can be steadily based. Accordingly, greatnesscannot be confused with mere duration, nor the competition of values decided byan endurance contest.3But the conservative mood is strong, almost as strong as the pervasive liberalrhetoric, and there is a way to satisfy them both. One refuses to recognize andconfront the top as it is, and one refuses to imagine a more defensible one. Onesimply denies that there is any elite or even any upper class, or at any rateasserts that in so far as such exist they do not really count in the Americanway of life. If this can be held firmly to be the case, then one can indulge theconservative mood without having to associate it with the actual elite or withany imaginary aristocracy.When they write of the upper classes, conservatives of the painless school ofliberalism often confuse wishful image with reality. Either they tend torelegate the elite to the past or they diversify its elements in the present. Inthe nineteenth century, leaning into the future, liberals relegated the elite tothe past; in the twentieth century, being heavy with the insistent present, theyhave considered elites to be diversified to the point of powerlessness.*[page_332.html#pg332fn1a] So far as power is concerned, nobody really makes thedecisions; let us fall back upon official and formal images of representativegovernment. So far as wealth or high income is concerned, that is after allwithout decisive consequence, although perhaps it does affect the tone ofsociety at large. Besides, everybody in America is rich nowadays. This unseriousliberalism is the nerve-center of the present-day conservative mood.Perhaps nothing is of more importance, both as cause and as effect, to theconservative mood than the rhetorical victory and the intellectual and politicalcollapse of American liberalism. It is of course obvious that the kind of‘liberalism’ that prevailed in the ’thirties has lost the political initiativein the postwar era. In the economic boom and the military terror of this era, asmall group of political primitives, on the middle levels of power, haveexploited the new American jitters, emptied domestic politics of rationalcontent, and decisively lowered the level of public sensibility. They haveattacked the policies of the New and Fair Deals; tried to rewrite the history ofthese administrations; and impugned the very biographies of those who took partin them. They have done all this in a manner that reveals clearly their appealto the rankling status resentment of those newly prosperous classes which,having achieved considerable wealth during and after World War II, have notreceived the prestige or gained the power they have felt to be their due.**[page_332.html#pg332fn2a]The petty right have appealed less to the economically discontented than to thestatus frustrated. They have done so by attacking the symbols, the men, and theinstitutions of established prestige.7 [ch15_notes.html#ch14en7] At the verybeginning of their push, they almost succeeded in destroying one of the innercitadels of the old upper class—the Foreign Service—and at one high point oftheir drive, their leading member, having told off an army general, enabled anation-wide public to witness the Secretary of the Army, who was also a man ofolder family wealth, being disgraced in a public brawl with unestablishednihilists.They have brought to wide attention a new conception of national loyalty, asloyalty to individual gangs who placed themselves above the establishedlegitimations of the state and invited its personnel to do likewise. They havemade clear the central place now achieved in the governmental process by secretpolice and secret ‘investigations,’ to the point where observant men speakrealistically of a shadow cabinet based in considerable part upon new ways ofpower which include the wire tap, the private eye, the use and threat ofblackmail. They have dramatized the hollowing out of sensibility among apopulation which for a generation has been steadily and increasingly subjectedto the shrill trivialization of the mass means of entertainment and distraction.They have brought into public view the higher immorality as well as themindlessness of selected upper and middle circles. And they have revealed adecayed and frightened liberalism weakly defending itself from the insecure andruthless fury of political gangsters.As the liberalism-of-the-’thirties sat in its postwar hearing, liberals becameaware, from time to time, of how near they were to the edge of mindlessness. Thestatus edifice of established bourgeois society was under attack, but since inAmerica there is nothing from the past above that edifice, and since those ofonce liberal and left persuasion see nothing in the future below it, they havebecome terribly frightened by the viciousness of the attack, and their politicallives have been narrowed to the sharp edge of defensive anxiety.Postwar liberalism has been organizationally impoverished: the prewar years ofliberalism-in-power devitalized independent liberal groups, drying up the grassroots, making older leaders dependent upon the federal center and not trainingnew leaders round the country. The New Deal left no liberal organization tocarry on any liberal program; rather than a new party, its instrument was aloose coalition inside an old one, which quickly fell apart so far as liberalideas are concerned. Moreover, the New Deal used up the heritage of liberalideas, made them banal as it put them into law; turned liberalism into a set ofadministrative routines to defend rather than a program to fight for.8[ch15_notes.html#ch14en8]In their moral fright, postwar liberals have not defended any left or even anymilitantly liberal position: their defensive posture has, first of all, led themto celebrate the ‘civil liberties,’ in contrast with their absence from SovietRussia. In fact, many have been so busy celebrating the civil liberties thatthey have had less time to defend them; and, more importantly, most have been sobusy defending civil liberties that they have had neither the time nor theinclination to use them. ‘In the old days,’ Archibald MacLeish remarked at theend of the ‘forties, freedom ‘was something you used … [it] has now becomesomething you save—something you put away and protect like your otherpossessions—like a deed or a bond in a bank.’9 [ch15_notes.html#ch14en9]It is much safer to celebrate civil liberties than to defend them; it is muchsafer to defend them as a formal right than to use them in a politicallyeffective way. Even those who would most willingly subvert these libertiesusually do so in their very name. It is easier still to defend someone else’sright to have used them years ago than to have something yourself to say now andto say it now forcibly. The defense of civil liberties—even of their practice adecade ago—has become the major concern of many liberal and once leftwardscholars. All of which is a safe way of diverting intellectual effort from thesphere of political reflection and demand.The defensive posture of the postwar liberals has also involved them in the verynervous center of elite and plebeian anxieties about the position of America inthe world today. At the root of these anxieties is not simply internationaltension and the terrible, helpless feeling of many that there is no alternativeto another war. There is also a specific worry with which many Americans areseriously concerned. The United States is now engaged with other nations, inparticular Russia, in a full-scale competition for cultural prestige based onnationality. In this competition, at issue are American music, literature, andart and, in a somewhat higher meaning than is usually given the term, TheAmerican Way of Life. The economic, military and political power of the UnitedStates greatly exceeds its cultural spell. What America has abroad is power;what it does not have at home or abroad is cultural prestige. This fact has ledmany liberals into the new American celebration,10 [ch15_notes.html#ch14en10]which rests not only upon their felt need to defend themselves in nationalistterms against the petty right but also upon the urgent compulsion to uphold thecultural prestige of America abroad.But the defensive posture and the organizational impoverishment are not the fullstory of what has happened to make American liberalism painless to the rich andthe powerful. Over the past half century, liberalism has been undergoing a moraland intellectual decline of serious proportion. As a proclamation of ideals,classic liberalism, like classic socialism, remains part of the seculartradition of the western society. But as a rhetoric, liberalism’s key terms havebecome the common denominators of the political vocabulary; in this rhetoricalvictory, in which the most divergent positions are all proclaimed and defendedin the same liberal terms, liberalism has been stretched beyond any usefulnessas a way of defining issues and stating policies.The great range and variety of life in America does not include a great rangeand variety of political statement, much less of political alternative. In theirrhetoric, spokesmen of all interests share much more than they differ. Althoughonly the liberals are captured by it, all of them use the liberal rhetoric. Thestereotype of America as essentially a progressive and even a radical countryfinds its anchorage only in its technological sphere,* [page_335.html#pg335fn1a]and in strange ways, in the fashions of its entertainment and amusementindustries. These have been so ‘dynamic’ and ‘radical’ that they have led to thecharacteristic American trait of animated distraction. These two surface areasof life have often been misinterpreted, at home and abroad, as America thedynamic and progressive, instead of what is the fact: America is a conservativecountry without any conservative ideology. The intellectual slackness of itspolitical life is such that it does very well with the liberal rhetoric. If, asa rhetoric, liberalism has become a mask of all political positions, as a theoryof society it has become irrelevant, and in its optative mood, misleading. Norevision of liberalism as a theory of the mechanics of modern social change hasovercome the trademark of the nineteenth century that is stamped upon it.Liberalism as a social theory rests on the notion of a society in automaticbalance.11 [ch15_notes.html#ch14en11]The idea of the great balance, in all its various forms, is now the prevailingcommon-sense view of public affairs. It is also the theory of power held by mostacademic social scientists; and it is the resting place of the conservativemood, as sustained by the liberal intelligentsia. This mood cannot bearticulated as classic conservatism; it cannot rest upon a pre-capitalist, muchless upon a pre-industrial, base; and it cannot employ the image of a society inwhich authority is legitimated by traditionalism as interpreted by a recognizedaristocracy.As an intellectual articulation, the conservative mood is merely a reformulationof classic liberalism in the entirely unclassical age of the twentieth century;it is the image of a society in which authority is at a minimum because it isguided by the autonomous forces of the magic market. The ‘providence’ of classicconservatism becomes liberalism’s generalization of the ‘unseen hand’ of themarket, for, in secular guise, Providence refers to a faith that the unintendedconsequences of many wills form a pattern, and that this pattern ought to beallowed to work itself out. Accordingly, it can be said that there is no elite,that there is no ruling class, that there are no powerful centers which needdefense. Instead of justifying the power of an elite by portraying it favorably,one denies that any set of men, any class, any organization has any reallyconsequential power. American liberalism is thus readily made to sustain theconservative mood. It is, in fact, because of the dominance of such liberalterms and assumptions that no need is felt by the elite of power and wealth foran explicitly conservative ideology.4The greatest appeal of romantic pluralism* [page_336.html#pg336fn1a] to those ofconservative yearning is that it makes unnecessary any explicit justification ofthe men who are ostensibly in charge of public affairs. For if they are all inbalance, each of them really quite impotent, then no one set of higher circlesand no manageable set of institutional arrangements can be held accountable forthe events and decisions of our time. Therefore, all serious political effort isreally a delusion which sensible men may observe with interest but which theycertainly do not allow to engage them morally.That is the political meaning of the conservative mood of today; in the end, itis an irresponsible style of pretentious smugness. Curiously enough, for aconservative mood, it is not a snobbery linked with nostalgia, but, on thecontrary, with what is just one-step-ahead-of-the-very-latest-thing, which is tosay that it is a snobbery based not on tradition but on fashion and fad.12[ch15_notes.html#ch14en12] Those involved are not thinking for a nation, or evenabout a nation; they are thinking of and for themselves. In self-selectedcoteries, they confirm one another’s mood, which thus becomes snobbishlyclosed—and quite out of the main stream of the practice of decision and thereality of power.One may thus suppose, quite correctly, that the conservative mood is a playfullittle fashion toyed with in a period of material prosperity by a fewcomfortable writers. Certainly it is not a serious effort to work out a coherentview of the world in which we live and the demands we might make upon it aspolitical men—conservative, liberal or radical. Neither an intellectualcommunity nor a set of liberal publics is providing the terms of those issuesand conflicts, decisions and policies that make up the history of our time. Thecombination of the liberal rhetoric and the conservative mood, in fact, hasobfuscated hard issues and made possible historical development without benefitof idea. The prevalence of this mood and this rhetoric means that thought, inany wide meaning of the term, has become largely irrelevant to such politics ashave been visible, and that in postwar America mind has been divorced fromreality.The petty conservatives, of course, have no more won political power thanadministrative liberals have retained it. While these two camps have beenengaged in wordy battle on the middle levels of power, on the upper levels, lessnoisy and more sophisticated conservatives have assumed political power.Accordingly, in their imbroglio with the noisy right, liberal and once-leftforces have in effect defended these established conservatives, even as theyhave been absorbed by conflict with their own leftward pasts, and have lost anypoint of effective defense against the outrageous accusations of the pettyright. The elite of corporation, army, and state have benefited politically andeconomically and militarily by the antics of the petty right, who have become,often unwittingly, their political shocktroops.It is in this context of material prosperity, with the demagogic right settingthe tone of public sensibility; the more sophisticated conservatives silentlyachieving established power in a largely undebated victory; with liberal ideasmade official in the ’thirties, now stolen and banalized by alien use; withliberal hopes carefully adjusted to mere rhetoric by thirty years of rhetoricalvictory; with radicalism deflated and radical hope stoned to death by thirtyyears of defeat—it is in this context that the conservative mood has set inamong the observant scholars. Among them there is no demand and no dissent, andno opposition to the monstrous decisions that are being made without deep orwidespread debate, in fact with no debate at all. There is no opposition to theundemocratically impudent manner in which policies of high military and civilianauthority are simply turned out as facts accomplished. There is no opposition topublic mindlessness in all its forms nor to all those forces and men that wouldfurther it. But above all—among the men of knowledge there is little or noopposition to the divorce of knowledge from power, of sensibilities from men ofpower, no opposition to the divorce of mind from reality.*[page_338.html#pg338fn1a] Contemporary men of power, accordingly, are able tocommand without any ideological cloak, political decisions occur without benefitof political discussion or political ideas, and the higher circles of Americahave come to be the embodiment of the American system of organizedirresponsibility.5It should not be supposed that such few and small publics as still exist, oreven the American masses, share the conservative mood of the intellectuals. Butneither should it be supposed that they have firmly in mind adequate images ofthe American elite. Their images are ambiguous; they are mainly in terms ofstatus and wealth rather than of power; and they are quite moral in apolitically petty way.Moral distrust of the high and mighty is of course an old American custom.Sometimes, as during the ’thirties, it is primarily of the corporate rich—thencalled economic royalists; sometimes, as between wars, of admirals and generals;and, all the time it is, at least a little bit, of the politicians.One must, of course, discount the wonderful make-believe and easy accusation ofcampaign oratory. And yet, the rather persistent attention paid to such mattersas ‘corruption’ in business and government expresses a widespread concern withpublic morality and personal integrity in high places, and signifies that it hasbeen an underlying worry in almost every area of American life.These areas include military and political as well as directly economicinstitutions; they include the elite as the heads of these major institutions aswell as the elite as a set of private individuals. Many little disclosures,spurring the moral worry of those still capable of such concern, have indicatedhow widespread public immorality might be.* [page_339.html#pg339fn1a]What element of the higher circles—what would-be element—has such immorality nottouched? Perhaps all those cases that come briefly to public attention are butmarginal—or, at any rate, those that were caught. But then, there is the feelingthat the bigger you are, the less likely you are to be caught. There is thefeeling that all the petty cases seem to signify something grander, that they godeeper and that their roots are now well organized in the higher and middleAmerican ways of life. But among the mass distractions this feeling soon passesharmlessly away. For the American distrust of the high and mighty is a distrustwithout doctrine and without political focus; it is a distrust felt by the masspublic as a series of more or less cynically expected disclosures. Corruptionand immoralities, petty and grand, are facts about the higher circles, ofteneven characteristic facts about many of them. But the immoral tone of Americansociety today also involves the lack of public sensibility when confronted withthese facts. Effective moral indignation is not evoked by the corrupt publiclife of our time; the old middle-class moralities have been replaced in Americaby the higher immorality.The exploiting plutocrat and the corrupted machine of the ’nineties werereplaced in public imagery by the uncultivated philistine and provincial of the’twenties, who, in turn, were replaced by the economic royalists and theircohorts of the ’thirties. All these were negative images; the first of urbangreed as seen through an indignant and rural moral optic; the second of mindlessBabbitry as seen by urban strata for whom moral principles have been replaced bybig-city ways; and the third, somewhat less clearly, of the old plutocrat turnedmore systematic and impersonal.But the corporate rich of the ’forties and ’fifties, in their economic and intheir political aspects—there are no such stereotypes of them; they are rathercynically accepted, and even secretly admired by members of the mass society. Nonegative stereotype has been widely formed of the corporate rich and thepolitical outsider; and if one or two should crop up in popular imagery, theyare soon vanquished by the ‘forward-looking,’ energetic, clean-cut American boyas executive.Given the state of the mass society, we should not expect anything else. Most ofits members are distracted by status, by the disclosures of pettierimmortalities, and by that Machiavellianism-for the-little-man that is the deathof political insurgency. Perhaps it might be different were the intellectualcommunity not so full of the conservative mood, not so comfortably timid, not soabsorbed by the new gentility of many of its members. But given these conditionsof mass society and intellectual community, we can readily understand why thepower elite of America has no ideology and feels the need of none, why its ruleis naked of ideas, its manipulation without attempted justification. It is thismindlessness of the powerful that is the true higher immorality of our time;for, with it, there is associated the organized irresponsibility that is todaythe most important characteristic of the American system of corporate power."},{"pageContent":"15THE HIGHER IMMORALITYTHE higher immorality can neither be narrowed to the political sphere norunderstood as primarily a matter of corrupt men in fundamentally soundinstitutions. Political corruption is one aspect of a more general immorality;the level of moral sensibility that now prevails is not merely a matter ofcorrupt men.1 [ch15_notes.html#ch15en1] The higher immorality is a systematicfeature of the American elite; its general acceptance is an essential feature ofthe mass society.Of course, there may be corrupt men in sound institutions, but when institutionsare corrupting many of the men who live and work in them are necessarilycorrupted. In the corporate era, economic relations become impersonal—and theexecutive feels less personal responsibility. Within the corporate worlds ofbusiness, war-making and politics, the private conscience is attenuated—and thehigher immorality is institutionalized. It is not merely a question of a corruptadministration in corporation, army, or state; it is a feature of the corporaterich, as a capitalist stratum, deeply intertwined with the politics of themilitary state.From this point of view, the most important question, for instance, about thecampaign funds of ambitious young politicians is not whether the politicians aremorally insensitive, but whether or not any young man in American politics, whohas come so far and so fast, could very well have done so today withoutpossessing or acquiring a somewhat blunted moral sensibility. Many of theproblems of ‘white-collar crime’ and of relaxed public morality, of high-pricedvice and of fading personal integrity, are problems of structural immorality.They are not merely the problem of the small character twisted by the badmilieu. And many people are at least vaguely aware that this is so. As news ofhigher immoralities breaks, they often say, ‘Well, another one got caughttoday,’ thereby implying that the cases disclosed are not odd events involvingoccasional characters but symptoms of a widespread condition. There is goodprobative evidence that they are right. But what is the underlying condition ofwhich all these instances are symptoms?1The moral uneasiness of our time results from the fact that older values andcodes of uprightness no longer grip the men and women of the corporate era, norhave they been replaced by new values and codes which would lend moral meaningand sanction to the corporate routines they must now follow. It is not that themass public has explicitly rejected received codes; it is rather that to many ofthe members these codes have become hollow. No moral terms of acceptance areavailable, but neither are any moral terms of rejection. As individuals they aremorally defenseless; as groups, they are politically indifferent. It is thisgeneralized lack of commitment that is meant when it is said that ‘the public’is morally confused.But, of course, not only ‘the public’ is morally confused in this way. ‘Thetragedy of official Washington,’ James Reston has commented, ‘is that it isconfounded at every turn by the hangover of old political habits and outworninstitutions but is no longer nourished by the ancient faith on which it wasfounded. It clings to the bad things and casts away the permanent. It professesbelief but does not believe. It knows the old words but has forgotten themelody. It is engaged in an ideological war without being able to define its ownideology. It condemns the materialism of an atheistic enemy, but glorifies itsown materialism.’2 [ch15_notes.html#ch15en2]In economic and political institutions the corporate rich now wield enormouspower, but they have never had to win the moral consent of those over whom theyhold this power. Every such naked interest, every new, unsanctioned power ofcorporation, farm bloc, labor union, and governmental agency that has risen inthe past two generations has been clothed with morally loaded slogans. For whatis not done in the name of the public interest? As these slogans wear out, newones are industriously made up, also to be banalized in due course. And all thewhile, recurrent economic and military crises spread fears, hesitations, andanxieties which give new urgency to the busy search for moral justifications anddecorous excuses.‘Crisis’ is a bankrupted term, because so many men in high places have evoked itin order to cover up their extraordinary policies and deeds; as a matter offact, it is precisely the absence of crises that is a cardinal feature of thehigher immorality. For genuine crises involve situations in which men at largeare presented with genuine alternatives, the moral meanings of which are clearlyopened to public debate. The higher immorality, the general weakening of oldervalues and the organization of irresponsibility have not involved any publiccrises; on the contrary, they have been matters of a creeping indifference and asilent hollowing out.The images that generally prevail of the higher circles are the images of theelite seen as celebrities. In discussing the professional celebrities, I notedthat the instituted elites of power do not monopolize the bright focus ofnational acclaim. They share it nationally with the frivolous or the sultrycreatures of the world of celebrity, which thus serves as a dazzling blind oftheir true power. In the sense that the volume of publicity and acclaim ismainly and continuously upon those professional celebrities, it is not upon thepower elite. So the social visibility of that elite is lowered by the statusdistraction, or rather public vision of them is through the celebrity who amusesand entertains—or disgusts, as the case may be.The absence of any firm moral order of belief makes men in the mass all the moreopen to the manipulation and distraction of the world of the celebrities. In duecourse, such a ‘turnover’ of appeals and codes and values as they are subjectedto leads them to distrust and cynicism, to a sort ofMachiavellianism-for-the-little-man. Thus they vicariously enjoy theprerogatives of the corporate rich, the nocturnal antics of the celebrity, andthe sad-happy life of the very rich.But with all this, there is still one old American value that has not markedlydeclined: the value of money and of the things money can buy—these, even ininflated times, seem as solid and enduring as stainless steel. ‘I’ve been richand I’ve been poor,’ Sophie Tucker has said, ‘and believe me, rich is best.’3[ch15_notes.html#ch15en3] As many other values are weakened, the question forAmericans becomes not ‘Is there anything that money, used with intelligence,will not buy?’ but, ‘How many of the things that money will not buy are valuedand desired more than what money will buy?’ Money is the one unambiguouscriterion of success, and such success is still the sovereign American value.Whenever the standards of the moneyed life prevail, the man with money, nomatter how he got it, will eventually be respected. A million dollars, it issaid, covers a multitude of sins. It is not only that men want money; it is thattheir very standards are pecuniary. In a society in which the money-maker hashad no serious rival for repute and honor, the word ‘practical’ comes to meanuseful for private gain, and ‘common sense,’ the sense to get ahead financially.The pursuit of the moneyed life is the commanding value, in relation to whichthe influence of other values has declined, so men easily become morallyruthless in the pursuit of easy money and fast estate-building.A great deal of American corruption—although not all of it—is simply a part ofthe old effort to get rich and then to become richer. But today the context inwhich the old drive must operate has changed. When both economic and politicalinstitutions were small and scattered—as in the simpler models of classicaleconomics and Jeffersonian democracy—no man had it in his power to bestow or toreceive great favors. But when political institutions and economic opportunitiesare at once concentrated and linked, then public office can be used for privategain.Governmental agencies contain no more of the higher immorality than do businesscorporations. Political men can grant financial favors only when there areeconomic men ready and willing to take them. And economic men can seek politicalfavors only when there are political agents who can bestow such favors. Thepublicity spotlight, of course, shines brighter upon the transactions of the menin government, for which there is good reason. Expectations being higher,publics are more easily disappointed by public officials. Businessmen aresupposed to be out for themselves, and if they successfully skate on legallythin ice, Americans generally honor them for having gotten away with it. But ina civilization so thoroughly business-penetrated as America, the rules ofbusiness are carried over into government—especially when so many businessmenhave gone into government. How many executives would really fight for a lawrequiring a careful and public accounting of all executive contracts and‘expense accounts’? High income taxes have resulted in a network of collusionbetween big firm and higher employee. There are many ingenious ways to cheat thespirit of the tax laws, as we have seen, and the standards of consumption ofmany high-priced men are determined more by complicated expense accounts than bysimple take-home pay. Like prohibition, the laws of income taxes and theregulations of wartime exist without the support of firm business convention. Itis merely illegal to cheat them, but it is smart to get away with it. Lawswithout supporting moral conventions invite crime, but much more importantly,they spur the growth of an expedient, amoral attitude.A society that is in its higher circles and on its middle levels widely believedto be a network of smart rackets does not produce men with an inner moral sense;a society that is merely expedient does not produce men of conscience. A societythat narrows the meaning of ‘success’ to the big money and in its terms condemnsfailure as the chief vice, raising money to the plane of absolute value, willproduce the sharp operator and the shady deal. Blessed are the cynical, for onlythey have what it takes to succeed.2In the corporate world, in the political directorate, and increasingly in theascendant military, the heads of the big hierarchies and power machines are seennot only as men who have succeeded, but as wielders of the patronage of success.They interpret and they apply to individuals the criteria of success. Thoseimmediately below them are usually members of their clique, of their clientele,sound men as they themselves are sound. But the hierarchies are intricatelyrelated to one another, and inside each clique are some whose loyalties are toother cliques. There are personal loyalties as well as official ones, personalas well as impersonal criteria for advancement. As we trace the career of theindividual member of various higher circles, we are also tracing the history ofhis loyalties, for the first and overshadowing fact about the higher circles,from the standpoint of what it takes to succeed within them, is that they arebased upon self-co-optation. The second fact about these hierarchies of successis that they do not form one monolithic structure; they are a complex set ofvariously related and often antagonistic cliques. The third fact we mustrecognize is that, in any such world, younger men who would succeed attempt torelate themselves to those in charge of their selection as successes.Accordingly, the American literature of practical aspiration—which carries thegreat fetish of success—has undergone a significant shift in its advice about‘what it takes to succeed.’ The sober, personal virtues of will power andhonesty, of high-mindedness and the constitutional inability to say ‘yes’ to TheEasy Road of women, tobacco, and wine—this later nineteenth-century image hasgiven way to ‘the most important single factor, the effective personality,’which ‘commands attention by charm,’ and ‘radiates self-confidence.’ In this‘new way of life,’ one must smile often and be a good listener, talk in terms ofthe other man’s interests and make the other feel important—and one must do allthis sincerely. Personal relations, in short, have become part of ‘publicrelations,’ a sacrifice of selfhood on a personality market, to the sole end ofindividual success in the corporate way of life.4 [ch15_notes.html#ch15en4]Being justified by superior merit and hard work, but being founded onco-optation by a clique, often on quite other grounds, the elite careerist mustcontinually persuade others and himself as well that he is the opposite of whathe actually is.It is the proud claim of the higher circles in America that their members areentirely self-made. That is their self-image and their well-publicized myth.Popular proof of this is based on anecdotes; its scholarly proof is supposed torest upon statistical rituals whereby it is shown that varying proportions ofthe men at the top are sons of men of lower rank. We have already seen theproportions of given elite circles composed of the men who have risen. But whatis more important than the proportions of the sons of wage workers among thesehigher circles is the criteria of admission to them, and the question of whoapplies these criteria. We cannot from upward mobility infer higher merit. Evenif the rough figures that now generally hold were reversed, and 90 per cent ofthe elite were sons of wage workers—but the criteria of co-optation by the eliteremained what they now are—we could not from that mobility necessarily infermerit. Only if the criteria of the top positions were meritorious, and only ifthey were self-applied, as in a purely entrepreneurial manner, could we smugglemerit into such statistics—from any statistics—of mobility. The idea that theself-made man is somehow ‘good’ and that the family-made man is not good makesmoral sense only when the career is independent, when one is on one’s own as anentrepreneur. It would also make sense in a strict bureaucracy whereexaminations control advancement. It makes little sense in the system ofcorporate co-optation.There is, in psychological fact, no such thing as a self-made man. No man makeshimself, least of all the members of the American elite. In a world of corporatehierarchies, men are selected by those above them in the hierarchy in accordancewith whatever criteria they use. In connection with the corporations of America,we have seen the current criteria. Men shape themselves to fit them, and arethus made by the criteria, the social premiums that prevail. If there is no suchthing as a self-made man, there is such a thing as a self-used man, and thereare many such men among the American elite.Under such conditions of success, there is no virtue in starting out poor andbecoming rich. Only where the ways of becoming rich are such as to requirevirtue or to lead to virtue does personal enrichment imply virtue. In a systemof co-optation from above, whether you began rich or poor seems less relevant inrevealing what kind of man you are when you have arrived than in revealing theprinciples of those in charge of selecting the ones who succeed.All this is sensed by enough people below the higher circles to lead to cynicalviews of the lack of connection between merit and mobility, between virtue andsuccess. It is a sense of the immorality of accomplishment, and it is revealedin the prevalence of such views as: ‘it’s all just another racket,’ and ‘it’snot what you know but who you know.’ Considerable numbers of people now acceptthe immorality of accomplishment as a going fact.Some observers are led by their sense of the immorality of accomplishment to theideology, obliquely set forth by academic social science, of human relations inindustry;5 [ch15_notes.html#ch15en5] still others to the solace of mind providedby the newer literature of resignation, of peace of mind, which in somequietened circles replaces the old literature of frenzied aspiration, of how toget ahead. But, regardless of the particular style of reaction, the sense of theimmorality of accomplishment often feeds into that level of public sensibilitywhich we have called the higher immorality. The old self-made man’s is atarnished image, and no other image of success has taken its once bright place.Success itself, as the American model of excellence, declines as it becomes onemore feature of the higher immorality.3Moral distrust of the American elite—as well as the fact of organizedirresponsibility—rests upon the higher immorality, but also upon vague feelingsabout the higher ignorance. Once upon a time in the United States, men ofaffairs were also men of sensibility: to a considerable extent the elite ofpower and the elite of culture coincided, and where they did not coincide theyoften overlapped as circles. Within the compass of a knowledgeable and effectivepublic, knowledge and power were in effective touch; and more than that, thispublic decided much that was decided.‘Nothing is more revealing,’ James Reston has written, ‘than to read the debatein the House of Representatives in the Eighteen Thirties on Greece’s fight withTurkey for independence and the Greek-Turkish debate in the Congress in 1947.The first is dignified and eloquent, the argument marching from principlethrough illustration to conclusion; the second is a dreary garble of debatingpoints, full of irrelevancies and bad history.’6 [ch15_notes.html#ch15en6]George Washington in 1783 relaxed with Voltaire’s ‘letters’ and Locke’s ‘OnHuman Understanding’; Eisenhower read cowboy tales and detective stories.7[ch15_notes.html#ch15en7] For such men as now typically arrive in the higherpolitical, economic and military circles, the briefing and the memorandum seemto have pretty well replaced not only the serious book, but the newspaper aswell. Given the immorality of accomplishment, this is perhaps as it must be, butwhat is somewhat disconcerting about it is that they are below the level onwhich they might feel a little bit ashamed of the uncultivated style of theirrelaxation and of their mental fare, and that no self-cultivated public is in aposition by its reactions to educate them to such uneasiness.By the middle of the twentieth century, the American elite have become anentirely different breed of men from those who could on any reasonable groundsbe considered a cultural elite, or even for that matter cultivated men ofsensibility. Knowledge and power are not truly united inside the ruling circles;and when men of knowledge do come to a point of contact with the circles ofpowerful men, they come not as peers but as hired men. The elite of power,wealth, and celebrity do not nave even a passing acquaintance with the elite ofculture, knowledge and sensibility; they are not in touch with them—although theostentatious fringes of the two worlds sometimes overlap in the world of thecelebrity.Most men are encouraged to assume that, in general, the most powerful and thewealthiest are also the most knowledgeable or, as they might say, ‘thesmartest.’ Such ideas are propped up by many little slogans about those who‘teach because they can’t do,’ and about ‘if you’re so smart, why aren’t yourich?’* [page_351.html#pg351fn1a] But all that such wisecracks mean is thatthose who use them assume that power and wealth are sovereign values for all menand especially for men ‘who are smart.’ They assume also that knowledge alwayspays off in such ways, or surely ought to, and that the test of genuineknowledge is just such pay-offs. The powerful and the wealthy must be the men ofmost knowledge, otherwise how could they be where they are? But to say thatthose who succeed to power must be ‘smart,’ is to say that power is knowledge.To say that those who succeed to wealth must be smart, is to say that wealth isknowledge.The prevalence of such assumptions does reveal something that is true: thatordinary men, even today, are prone to explain and to justify power and wealthin terms of knowledge or ability. Such assumptions also reveal something of whathas happened to the kind of experience that knowledge has come to be. Knowledgeis no longer widely felt as an ideal; it is seen as an instrument. In a societyof power and wealth, knowledge is valued as an instrument of power and wealth,and also, of course, as an ornament in conversation.What knowledge does to a man (in clarifying what he is, and setting himfree)—that is the personal ideal of knowledge. What knowledge does to acivilization (in revealing its human meaning, and setting it free)—that is thesocial ideal of knowledge. But today, the personal and the social ideals ofknowledge have coincided in what knowledge does for the smart guy—it gets himahead; and for the wise nation—it lends cultural prestige, sanctifying powerwith authority.Knowledge seldom lends power to the man of knowledge. But the supposed, andsecret, knowledge of some men-on-the-make, and their very free use thereof, hasconsequence for other men who have not the power of defense. Knowledge, ofcourse, is neither good nor bad, nor is its use good or bad. ‘Bad men increasein knowledge as fast as good men,’ John Adams wrote, ‘and science, arts, taste,sense and letters, are employed for the purpose of injustice as well as forvirtue.’9 [ch15_notes.html#ch15en9] That was in 1790; today we have good reasonto know that it is so.The problem of knowledge and power is, and always has been, the problem of therelations of men of knowledge with men of power. Suppose we were to select theone hundred most powerful men, from all fields of power, in America today andline them up. And then, suppose we selected the one hundred most knowledgeablemen, from all fields of social knowledge, and lined them up. How many men wouldbe in both our line-ups? Of course our selection would depend upon what we meanby power and what we mean by knowledge—especially what we mean by knowledge.But, if we mean what the words seem to mean, surely we would find few if any menin America today who were in both groups, and surely we could find many more atthe time the nation was founded than we could find today. For, in the eighteenthcentury, even in this colonial outpost, men of power pursued learning, and menof learning were often in positions of power. In these respects we have, Ibelieve, suffered grievous decline.10 [ch15_notes.html#ch15en10]There is little union in the same persons of knowledge and power; but persons ofpower do surround themselves with men of some knowledge, or at least with menwho are experienced in shrewd dealings. The man of knowledge has not become aphilosopher king; but he has often become a consultant, and moreover aconsultant to a man who is neither king-like nor philosophical. It is, ofcourse, true that the chairman of the pulp writers section of the Authors’League helped a leading senator ‘polish up the speeches he delivered in the 1952senatorial campaign.’11 [ch15_notes.html#ch15en11] But it is not natural in thecourse of their careers for men of knowledge to meet with those of power. Thelinks between university and government are weak, and when they do occur, theman of knowledge appears as an ‘expert’ which usually means as a hiredtechnician. Like most others in this society, the man of knowledge is himselfdependent for his livelihood upon the job, which nowadays is a prime sanction ofthought control. Where getting ahead requires the good opinions of more powerfulothers, their judgments become prime objects of concern. Accordingly, in so faras intellectuals serve power directly—in a job hierarchy—they often do sounfreely.The democratic man assumes the existence of a public, and in his rhetoricasserts that this public is the very seat of sovereignty. Two things are neededin a democracy: articulate and knowledgeable publics, and political leaders whoif not men of reason are at least reasonably responsible to such knowledgeablepublics as exist. Only where publics and leaders are responsive and responsible,are human affairs in democratic order, and only when knowledge has publicrelevance is this order possible. Only when mind has an autonomous basis,independent of power, but powerfully related to it, can mind exert its force inthe shaping of human affairs. This is democratically possible only when thereexists a free and knowledgeable public, to which men of knowledge may addressthemselves, and to which men of power are truly responsible. Such a public andsuch men—either of power or of knowledge—do not now prevail, and accordingly,knowledge does not now have democratic relevance in America.The characteristic member of the higher circles today is an intellectualmediocrity, sometimes a conscientious one, but still a mediocrity. Hisintelligence is revealed only by his occasional realization that he is not up tothe decisions he sometimes feels called upon to confront. But usually he keepssuch feelings private, his public utterances being pious and sentimental, grimand brave, cheerful and empty in their universal generality. He is open only toabbreviated and vulgarized, predigested and slanted ideas. He is a commander ofthe age of the phone call, the memo, and the briefing.By the mindlessness and mediocrity of men of affairs, I do not, of course, meanthat these men are not sometimes intelligent—although that is by no meansautomatically the case. It is not, however, primarily a matter of thedistribution of ‘intelligence’—as if intelligence were a homogeneous somethingof which there may be more or less. It is rather a matter of the type ofintelligence, of the quality of mind that is selected and formed. It is a matterof the evaluation of substantive rationality as the chief value in a man’s lifeand character and conduct. That evaluation is what is lacking in the Americanpower elite. In its place there are ‘weight’ and ‘judgment’ which count for muchmore in their celebrated success than any subtlety of mind or force ofintellect.All around and just below the weighty man of affairs are his technicallieutenants of power who have been assigned the role of knowledge and even ofspeech: his public relations men, his ghost, his administrative assistants, hissecretaries. And do not forget The Committees. With the increased means ofdecision, there is a crisis of understanding among the political directorate ofthe United States, and accordingly, there is often a commanding indecision.The lack of knowledge as an experience among the elite ties in with the malignascendancy of the expert, not only as fact but as legitimation. When questionedrecently about a criticism of defense policies made by the leader of theopposition party, the Secretary of Defense replied, ‘Do you think he is anexpert in the matter?’ When pressed further by reporters he asserted that the‘military chiefs think it is sound, and I think it is sound,’ and later, whenasked about specific cases, added: ‘In some cases, all you can do is ask theLord.’12 [ch15_notes.html#ch15en12] With such a large role so arrogantly givento God and to experts, what room is there for political leadership? Much lessfor public debate of what is after all every bit as much a political and a moralas a military issue. But then, from before Pearl Harbor, the trend has been theabdication of debate and the collapse of opposition under the easy slogan ofbi-partisanship.Beyond the lack of intellectual cultivation by political personnel and advisorycircle, the absence of publicly relevant mind has come to mean that powerfuldecisions and important policies are not made in such a way as to be justifiedor attacked; in short, debated in any intellectual form. Moreover, the attemptto so justify them is often not even made. Public relations displace reasonedargument; manipulation and undebated decisions of power replace democraticauthority. More and more, since the nineteenth century, as administration hasreplaced politics, the decisions of importance do not carry even the panoply ofreasonable discussion, but are made by God, by experts, and by men like Mr.Wilson.More and more the area of the official secret expands, as well as the area ofthe secret listening in on those who might divulge in public what the public,not being composed of experts with Q clearance, is not to know. The entiresequence of decisions concerning the production and the use of atomic weaponryhas been made without any genuine public debate, and the facts needed to engagein that debate intelligently have been officially hidden, distorted, and evenlied about. As the decisions become more fateful, not only for Americans butliterally for mankind, the sources of information are closed up, and therelevant facts needed for decision (even the decisions made!) are, aspolitically convenient ‘official secrets,’ withheld from the heavily ladenchannels of information.In those channels, meanwhile, political rhetoric seems to slide lower and lowerdown the scale of cultivation and sensibility. The height of such mindlesscommunications to masses, or what are thought to be masses, is probably thedemagogic assumption that suspicion and accusation, if repeated often enough,somehow equal proof of guilt—just as repeated claims about toothpaste or brandsof cigarettes are assumed to equal facts. The greatest kind of propaganda withwhich America is beset, the greatest at least in terms of volume and loudness,is commercial propaganda for soap and cigarettes and automobiles; it is to suchthings, or rather to Their Names, that this society most frequently sings itsloudest praises. What is important about this is that by implication andommission, by emphasis and sometimes by flat statement, this astounding volumeof propaganda for commodities is often untruthful and misleading; and isaddressed more often to the belly or to the groin than to the head or to theheart. Public communications from those who make powerful decisions, or whowould have us vote them into such decision-making places, more and more take onthose qualities of mindlessness and myth which commercial propaganda andadvertising have come to exemplify.In America today, men of affairs are not so much dogmatic as they are mindless.Dogma has usually meant some more or less elaborated justification of ideas andvalues, and thus has had some features (however inflexible and closed) of mind,of intellect, of reason. Nowadays what we are up against is precisely theabsence of mind of any sort as a public force; what we are up against is adisinterest in and a fear of knowledge that might have liberating publicrelevance. What this makes possible are decisions having no rationaljustifications which the intellect could confront and engage in debate.It is not the barbarous irrationality of dour political primitives that is theAmerican danger; it is the respected judgments of Secretaries of State, theearnest platitudes of Presidents, the fearful self-righteousness of sincereyoung American politicians from sunny California. These men have replaced mindwith platitude, and the dogmas by which they are legitimated are so widelyaccepted that no counter-balance of mind prevails against them. Such men asthese are crackpot realists: in the name of realism they have constructed aparanoid reality all their own; in the name of practicality they have projecteda utopian image of capitalism. They have replaced the responsible interpretationof events with the disguise of events by a maze of public relations; respect forpublic debate with unshrewd notions of psychological warfare; intellectualability with agility of the sound, mediocre judgment; the capacity to elaboratealternatives and gauge their consequences with the executive stance.4Despite—perhaps because of—the ostracism of mind from public affairs, theimmorality of accomplishment, and the general prevalence of organizedirresponsibility, the men of the higher circles benefit from the total power ofthe institutional domains over which they rule. For the power of theseinstitutions, actual or potential, is ascribed to them as the ostensibledecision-makers. Their positions and their activities, and even their persons,are hallowed by these ascriptions; and, around all the high places of power,there is a penumbra of prestige in which the political directorate, thecorporate rich, the admirals and generals are bathed. The elite of a society,however modest its individual member, embodies the prestige of the society’spower.* [page_357.html#pg357fn1a] Moreover, few individuals in positions of suchauthority can long resist the temptation to base their self-images, at least inpart, upon the sounding board of the collectivity which they head. Acting as therepresentative of his nation, his corporation, his army, in due course, he comesto consider himself and what he says and believes as expressive of thehistorically accumulated glory of the great institutions with which he comes toidentify himself. When he speaks in the name of his country or its cause, itspast glory also echoes in his ears.Status, no longer rooted primarily in local communities, follows the bighierarchies, which are on a national scale. Status follows the big money, evenif it has a touch of the gangster about it. Status follows power, even if it bewithout background. Below, in the mass society, old moral and traditionalbarriers to status break down and Americans look for standards of excellenceamong the circles above them, in terms of which to model themselves and judgetheir self-esteem. Yet nowadays, it seems easier for Americans to recognize suchrepresentative men in the past than in the present. Whether this is due to areal historical difference or merely to the political ease and expediency ofhindsight is very difficult to tell.* [page_358.html#pg358fn1a] At any rate itis a fact that in the political assignments of prestige there is littledisparagement of Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln, but much disagreement aboutcurrent figures. Representative men seem more easily recognizable after theyhave died; contemporary political leaders are merely politicians; they may bebig or little, but they are not great, and increasingly they are seen in termsof the higher immorality.Now again status follows power, and older types of exemplary figures have beenreplaced by the fraternity of the successful—the professional executives whohave become the political elite, and who are now the official representativemen. It remains to be seen whether they will become representative men in theimages and aspirations of the mass public, or whether they will endure anylonger than the displaced liberals of the ‘thirties. Their images arecontroversial, deeply involved in the immorality of accomplishment and thehigher immorality in general. Increasingly, literate Americans feel that thereis something synthetic about them. Their style and the conditions under whichthey become ‘big’ lend themselves too readily to the suspicion of the build-up;the shadows of the ghost writer and the make-up man loom too large; theslickness of the fabrication is too apparent.We should, of course, bear in mind that men of the higher circles may or may notseek to impose themselves as representative upon the underlying population, andthat relevant public sectors of the population may or may not accept theirimages. An elite may try to impose its claims upon the mass public, but thispublic may not cash them in. On the contrary, it may be indifferent or evendebunk their values, caricature their image, laugh at their claim to berepresentative men.In his discussion of models of national character, Walter Bagehot does not gointo such possibilities;15 [ch15_notes.html#ch15en15] but it is clear that forour contemporaries we must consider them, since precisely this reaction has ledto a sometimes frenzied and always expensive practice of what is known as‘public relations.’ Those who have both power and status are perhaps best offwhen they do not actively have to seek acclaim. The truly proud old familieswill not seek it; the professional celebrities are specialists in seeking itactively. Increasingly, the political, economic, and military elite—as we haveseen—compete with the celebrities and seek to borrow their status. Perhaps thosewho have unprecedented power without the aura of status, will always seek it,even if uneasily, among those who have publicity without power.For the mass public, there is the status distraction of the celebrity, as wellas the economic distraction of war prosperity; for the liberal intellectual, whodoes look to the political arena, there is the political distraction of thesovereign localities and of the middle levels of power, which sustain theillusion that America is still a self-balancing society. If the mass media focuson the professional celebrities, the liberal intellectuals, especially theacademic social scientists among them, focus upon the noisy middle levels.Professional celebrities and middle-level politicians are the most visiblefigures of the system; in fact, together they tend to monopolize thecommunicated or public scene that is visible to the members of the mass society,and thus to obscure and to distract attention from the power elite.The higher circles in America today contain, on the one hand, the laughing,erotic, dazzling glamour of the professional celebrity, and, on the other, theprestige aura of power, of authority, of might and wealth. These two pinnaclesare not unrelated. The power elite is not so noticeable as the celebrities, andoften does not want to be; the ‘power’ of the professional celebrity is thepower of distraction. America as a national public is indeed possessed of astrange set of idols. The professionals, in the main, are either glossy littleanimals or frivolous clowns; the men of power, in the main, rarely seem to bemodels of representative men.Such moral uneasiness as prevails among the American elite themselves isaccordingly quite understandable. Its existence is amply confirmed by the moreserious among those who have come to feel that they represent America abroad.There, the double-faced character of the American celebrity is reflected both bythe types of Americans who travel to play or to work, and in the images manyliterate and articulate Europeans hold of ‘Americans.’ Public honor in Americatends now to be either frivolous or grim; either altogether trivial orportentous of a greatly tightened-up system of prestige.The American elite is not composed of representative men whose conduct andcharacter constitute models for American imitation and aspiration. There is noset of men with whom members of the mass public can rightfully and gladlyidentify. In this fundamental sense, America is indeed without leaders. Yet suchis the nature of the mass public’s morally cynical and politically unspecifieddistrust that it is readily drained off without real political effect. That thisis so, after the men and events of the last thirty years, is further proof ofthe extreme difficulty of finding and of using in America today the politicalmeans of sanity for morally sane objectives.America—a conservative country without any conservative ideology—appears nowbefore the world a naked and arbitrary power, as, in the name of realism, itsmen of decision enforce their often crackpot definitions upon world reality. Thesecond-rate mind is in command of the ponderously spoken platitude. In theliberal rhetoric, vagueness, and in the conservative mood, irrationality, areraised to principle. Public relations and the official secret, the trivializingcampaign and the terrible fact clumsily accomplished, are replacing the reasoneddebate of political ideas in the privately incorporated economy, the militaryascendancy, and the political vacuum of modern America.The men of the higher circles are not representative men; their high position isnot a result of moral virtue; their fabulous success is not firmly connectedwith meritorious ability. Those who sit in the seats of the high and the mightyare selected and formed by the means of power, the sources of wealth, themechanics of celebrity, which prevail in their society. They are not menselected and formed by a civil service that is linked with the world ofknowledge and sensibility. They are not men shaped by nationally responsibleparties that debate openly and clearly the issues this nation now sounintelligently confronts. They are not men held in responsible check by aplurality of voluntary associations which connect debating publics with thepinnacles of decision. Commanders of power unequaled in human history, they havesucceeded within the American system of organized irresponsibility."},{"pageContent":"AFTERWORDBY ALAN WOLFE1C. Wright Mills’ The Power Elite was published in 1956, a time, as Mills himselfput it, when Americans were living through ‘a material boom, a nationalistcelebration, a political vacuum.’ It is not hard to understand why Americanswere as complacent as Mills charged.Let’s say you were a typical thirty-five-year-old voter in 1956. Imagine whatyour life had been like. When you were eight years old, the stock marketcrashed, and the resulting Great Depression began just as you started third orfourth grade. Hence your childhood was consumed with fighting off the povertyand unemployment of the single greatest economic catastrophe in Americanhistory. When you turned twenty-one, officially marking your maturity, theJapanese invaded Pearl Harbor, ensuring that your years as a young adult,especially if you were male, would be spent fighting on the ground in Europe orfrom island to island in Asia. If you were lucky enough to survive thatexperience, you returned home at the ripe old age of twenty-four, ready toresume the semblance of a normal life—only then to witness the Korean War,McCarthyism, and the outbreak of the Cold War with the Soviet Union.No wonder that, as you contemplated casting your vote in the 1956 presidentialelections, you were tempted to vote for the reelection of President Eisenhower.After all, he had commanded the Allied troops in World War II. To be sure, heoften seemed uninspiring in his speeches, and he was most comfortableassociating with rich businessmen, nearly all of whom were male, white,Christian, and conservative in their political leanings. Still, Eisenhoweroffered stability for voters whose lives had known nothing but the opposite. Forall the blustery talk of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles about the Russianmenace, the President himself seemed somewhat disengaged from foreign policy.And his domestic program amounted to little more than constructing the highwayswhich you planned to use as you thought about moving to Los Angeles in search ofthe jobs being created by what Eisenhower himself would soon call “the militaryindustrial complex.”Into this milieu exploded The Power Elite. C. Wright Mills was one of the firstintellectuals in America to write that the complacency of the Eisenhower yearswas not enough. His indictment was uncompromising. On the one hand, he claimed,vast concentrations of power had coagulated in America, making a mockery ofAmerican democracy. On the other, he charged that his fellow intellectuals hadsold out to the conservative mood in America, leaving their audience—theAmerican people themselves—in a state of ignorance and apathy bearing shockingresemblance to the totalitarian regimes that America had defeated or wascurrently fighting.One of the goals Mills set for himself in The Power Elite was to tell hisreaders—again, assuming that they were roughly thirty-five years of age—how muchthe organization of power in America had changed during their lifetimes. In the1920s, when this typical reader had been born, there existed what Mills called“local society,” towns and small cities throughout America whose political andsocial life was dominated by resident businessmen. Small-town elites, usuallyRepublican in their outlook, had a strong voice in Congress, for most of thecongressmen who represented them were either members of the dominant familiesthemselves or had close financial ties to them.By the time Mills wrote his book, this world of local elites had become asobsolete as the telegraph machine. Power had become nationalized in America,Mills charged, and as a result had also become interconnected. The Power Elitecalled attention to three prongs of power in the United States. First, businesshad shifted its focus from corporations that were primarily regional in theirworkforces and customer bases to ones that produced products in national marketsand developed national interests. What had once been a propertied class, tied tothe ownership of real assets, had become a managerial class, rewarded for itsability to organize the vast scope of corporate enterprise into an engine forever-expanding profits. No longer were the chief executive officers of thesecompanies chosen because they were of the right social background. Connectionsstill mattered, but so did bureaucratic skill. The men who possessed thoseskills were rewarded well for their efforts. Larded with expense accounts andpaid handsomely, they could exercise national influence not only through theircompanies, but through the roles they would called upon to serve in “thenational interest.”Similar changes had taken place in the military sector of American society.World War II, Mills argued, and the subsequent start of the Cold War, led to theestablishment of a ‘permanent war economy’ in the United States. Mills wrotethat the ‘warlords,’ his term for the military and its civilian allies, had oncebeen ‘only uneasy, poor relations within the American elite; now they are firstcousins; soon they may become elder brothers.’ Given an unlimited checkingaccount for politicians anxious to appear tough, buoyed by fantastictechnological and scientific achievements, and sinking roots in America’seducational institutions, the military, Mills believed, was becomingincreasingly autonomous. Of all the prongs of the power elite, this ‘militaryascendancy’ possessed the most dangerous implications. ‘American militarism, infully developed form, would mean the triumph in all areas of life of themilitary metaphysic, and hence the subordination to it of all other ways oflife.’Along with the military and corporate elites, Mill analyzed the role of what hecalled ‘the political directorate.’ Local elites had once been stronglyrepresented in Congress, but Congress itself, Mills pointed out, had lost powerto the executive branch. And within that branch, Mills could count roughly fiftypeople who, in his opinion, were ‘now in charge of the executive decisions madein the name of the United States of America.’ The very top positions—such as thesecretaries of state or defense—were occupied with men with close ties to theleading national corporations in the United States. These people were notattracted to their positions for the money; often, they made less than theywould have in the private sector. Rather, they understood that running theCentral Intelligence Agency or being secretary of the treasury gave one vastinfluence over the direction taken by the country. Firmly interlocked with themilitary and corporate sectors, the political leaders of the United Statesfashioned an agenda favorable to their class rather than what might be good forthe nation as a whole.Although written very much as a product of its time, The Power Elite has hadremarkable staying power. The book has remained in print for forty-four years inits original form, which means that the thirty-five-year-old person who read itwhen it first came out is now seventy-nine years old. The names and faces havechanged since the book’s appearance—younger readers will recognize hardly any ofthe corporate, military, and political leaders mentioned by Mills—but theunderlying question of whether America is as democratic in practice as it is intheory continues to matter very much.2The obvious question to any contemporary reader of The Power Elite is whetherits conclusions apply to United States today. Sorting out what is helpful inMills’ book from what has become obsolete seems a task worth undertaking.Each year, Fortune magazine publishes a list of the 500 leading Americancompanies. A glance at Table 1, which compares the top fifty corporations inAmerica in 1956 with the top fifty in 1998, indicates that roughly thirty of thefifty companies that dominated the economy when Mills wrote his book no longerdo so, including firms in such once seemingly impregnable industries such assteel, rubber, and food. Putting the point another way, the 1998 list containsthe names of many corporations that would have been quite familiar to Mills:General Motors is ranked first, Ford second, and Exxon third. But the companyimmediately following these giants—Wal-Mart stores—did not even exist at thetime Mills wrote; indeed, the idea that a chain of retail stores started by afolksy Arkansas merchant would someday outrank Mobil Oil, General Electric, orChrysler would have startled Mills. Furthermore, just as some industries havedeclined, whole new industries have appeared in America since 1956; IBM wasfifty-ninth when Mills wrote, hardly the computer giant—sixth on the currentFortune 500 list—that it is now. (Compaq and Intel, neither of which existedwhen Mills wrote his book, are also in the top fifty of the 1998 list.) Toillustrate the closed world of the power elite, Mills called attention to thefact that one man, Winthrop W. Aldrich, the American ambassador to GreatBritain, was a director of four of the top twenty-five companies in America in1950. In 1998, by contrast, only one of those companies, AT&T, was among thevery top: ChaseTable 150 Largest Corporations 1956 and 1998Image [../images/t0367_01.jpg] Image [../images/t0368_01.jpg]Manhattan was twenty-seventh, Metropolitan Life had fallen to forty-third, andthe New York Central Railroad was not to be found.One reason why places shift at the top of the corporate hierarchy is thatAmerican companies are continually merging with each other in an effort tosecure dominant market shares. Toward the end of 1998, the third largest companyin America, Exxon, announced plans to merge with the eighth largest, Mobil, tomake a new company that would dwarf in size anything contemplated by Mills.Indeed, one of the reasons why Mills called so much attention to corporate sizewas because of a long tradition in America, dating back to the Sherman Act of1898, that viewed monopolies as bad things to be discouraged by law. Under theinfluence of that tradition, some big companies have been broken up and newones—SBC Communications, Lucent Technologies—encouraged to form. But the ShermanAct is rarely invoked these days, at least in part because both Republican andDemocratic administrations are less likely to favor governmental regulation ofthe economy than they did in the Eisenhower years. When the former CEO ofGeneral Motors, who was also Eisenhower’s secretary of defense, said that whatwas good for his company was also good for America, people were shocked. Todaythat statement would be considered a proper, if perhaps unspoken, guide to therelationship between government and business.Mills got much right about the corporate elite. It is certainly the case, forexample, that those who run companies are also among the very rich; the gapbetween what a CEO makes and what workers make is extraordinarily large. Butthere is one difference between the world described by Mills and the world oftoday so striking that it cannot be passed over. As odd as it may sound, Mills’understanding of capitalism was not radical enough. Heavily influenced by thesociology of its time, The Power Elite portrays corporate executives asorganization men who ‘must “fit in” with those already at the top.’ They have tobe concerned with managing their impressions, as if the appearance of gettinggood results is more important than the actuality of them. Mills was disdainfulof the idea that leading businessmen were especially competent. ‘The fitsurvive,’ he wrote, ‘and fitness means, not formal competence—there probably isno such thing for top executive positions—but conformity with the criteria ofthose who have already succeeded.’It may well have been true in the 1950s that corporate leaders were notespecially inventive, but if so, that was because they faced relatively fewchallenges. If you were the head of General Motors in 1956, you knew thatAmerican automobile companies dominated your market; the last thing on your mindwas the fact that someday cars called Toyotas or Hondas would be your biggestthreat. You did not like the union that organized your workers, but if you weresmart, you realized that an ever-growing economy would enable you to trade offhigh wages for your workers in return for labor market stability. Smallercompanies that supplied you with parts were dependent on you for orders. Eachyear you wanted to outsell Ford and Chrysler, but you also had constructed withthem an elaborate system of signals so that they would not undercut your pricesand you would not undercut theirs. Whatever your market share in 1956, in otherwords, you could be fairly sure that it would be the same in 1957. Why then rockthe boat? It made perfect sense for budding executives to do what Mills arguedthey did do: to assume that the best way to get ahead was to go along.Very little of this picture remains accurate at the end of the twentiethcentury. Union membership as a percentage of the total workforce has declineddramatically, and while this means that companies can pay their workers less, italso means that they cannot expect to invest much in the training of theirworkers on the assumption that those workers will remain with the company formost of their lives. Foreign competition, once negligible, is now the rule ofthumb for most American companies, leading many of them to move parts of theircompanies overseas and to create their own global marketing arrangements.America’s fastest-growing industries can be found in the field of hightechnology, a development unanticipated by Mills. (‘Many modern theories ofindustrial development,’ he wrote, ‘stress technological developments, but thenumber of inventors among the very rich is so small as to be unappreciable.’)Often dominated by self-made men (another phenomenon about which Mills wasdoubtful), these firms are ruthlessly competitive, which upsets any possibilityof forming gentlemen’s agreements to control prices; indeed, among internetcompanies the notion is to provide the product with no price whatsoever—that is,for free—in the hopes of winning future customer loyalty. Under theseconditions, the executive who tried to follow the patterns described by Millswould be best off moving to a university and obtaining tenure.These radical changes in the competitive dynamics of American capitalism haveimportant implications for any effort to characterize the power elite of today.C. Wright Mills was a translator and interpreter of the German sociologist MaxWeber, and he borrowed from Weber the idea that a heavily bureaucratized societywould also be a stable and conservative society. Only in a society that changesrelatively little is it possible for an elite to have power in the first place,for if events change radically, then it tends to be the events that controlpeople rather than the people who control the events. There can be little doubtthat those who hold the highest positions in America’s corporate hierarchyremain, as they did in Mills’s day, the most powerful Americans. But not eventhey can control rapid technological transformations, intense globalcompetition, and ever-changing consumer tastes. American capitalism is simplytoo dynamic to be controlled for very long by anyone.3The Power Elite was written at a time when the exact role that the militarywould play in American life was very much up for grabs. Historically, Americanshad never been sympathetic to the idea that a permanent military presence wasrequired to defend the nation against its enemies. To be sure, Americans weresecond to none in their expressions of patriotism. They admired generals andshowed a distinct propensity to elect them to the presidency. If war wasrequired to defend the national interest, Americans would pay the costs in lostlives and lost opportunities. At the same time, Americans tended to be contentwith their geographic isolation from the rest of the world. They viewedpeacetime as the normal situation and war as the exception. After each of themajor wars fought by the United States, Americans retreated back intoisolationism.In their disinclination to have the military play an ongoing role in theirlives, Americans received considerable support from the leaders of theRepublican party. There is no other way to organize an effective military thanthrough the use of government, but if government were involved in offeringcontracts to private business, conservative isolationists believed, it would notbe long before government would be regulating the prices those businessescharged, the kinds of labor relations they practiced, and even how large theirprofits could be.One of the crucial arguments Mills made in The Power Elite was that theemergence of the Cold War completely transformed this historic opposition to apermanent military establishment in the United States. Indeed, a key theme ofMills’ book stressed that America’s military elite was now linked to itseconomic and political elite. Personnel were constantly shifting back and forthfrom the corporate world to the military world. Big companies like GeneralMotors had become dependent on military contracts. Scientific and technologicalinnovations sponsored by the military helped fuel the growth of the economy. Andwhile all these links between the economy and the military were being sealed,the military had become an active political force. Members of Congress, oncehostile to the military, now treated officers with great deference. And nopresident could hope to staff the Department of State, find intelligenceofficers, and appoint ambassadors without consulting with the military.Mills was persuaded that the emergence of the military as a key force inAmerican life required a substantial attack on the isolationism that had oncecharacterized public opinion. He argued that ‘the warlords, along with fellowtravelers and spokesmen, are attempting to plant their metaphysics firmly amongthe population at large.’ Their goal was nothing less than a redefinition ofreality, one in which the American people would come to accept what Mills called‘an emergency without a foreseeable end.’ He wrote, ‘War or a high state of warpreparedness is felt to be the normal and seemingly permanent condition of theUnited States.’ In this state of constant war fever, America could no longer beconsidered a genuine democracy, for democracy thrives on dissent anddisagreement, precisely what is not permitted in the military definition ofreality. If the changes described by Mills were indeed permanent, then The PowerElite could be read as the description of a deeply radical, and depressing,transformation in the nature of the United States.It remains true today, much as Mills wrote about his time, that Congress isextremely friendly to the military, at least in part because the military hasbecome such a powerful force in the districts of most congressmen. Militarybases are an important source of jobs for many Americans. Government spending onthe military is crucial to all those companies, such as Lockheed and Boeing,that manufacture military equipment. American firms are the leaders in theworld’s global arms market, manufacturing and exporting weapons everywhere. Someweapons systems never seem to die, even, as was the case with a ‘Star Wars’system design to repel incoming missiles, if there is no demonstrable militaryneed for them. At least one recent American president, Ronald Reagan, enhancedhis popularity by proclaiming the Soviet Union an ‘evil empire’and bydemonstrating his willingness to outspend the Russians in the arms race.Yet despite these similarities with the 1950s, both the world and the role thatAmerica plays in that world have changed. For one thing, the United States hasbeen unable to muster its forces for any sustained use in any foreign conflictsince Vietnam. Worried about the possibility of a public backlash against theloss of American lives, American presidents either refrain from pursuingmilitary adventures abroad or confine them to rapid strikes, along the linespursued by presidents Bush and Clinton in Iraq. Since 1989, moreover, thecollapse of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe has undermined thecapacity of America’s elites to mobilize support for military expenditures onthe grounds of a Soviet threat. China, which at the time Mills wrote wasconsidered a serious threat, is now viewed by American businessmen as a sourceof great potential investment. Domestic political support for a large andpermanent military establishment in the United States, in short, can no longerbe taken for granted.The immediate consequence of these changes in the world’s balance of power hasbeen a dramatic decrease in that proportion of the American economy devoted todefense. At the time Mills wrote, defense expenditures constituted roughly 60percent of all federal outlays and consumed nearly 10 percent of the U. S. grossdomestic product. By the late 1990s, those proportions had fallen to 17 percentof federal outlays and 3.5 percent of GDP (see Figure 1). Nearly three millionAmericans served in the armed forces at the time The Power Elite appeared, butthat number had dropped by half at century’s end. By almost any account, Mills’prediction that both the economy and the political system of Figure 1. theUnited States would come to be ever more dominated by the military is not borneout by the historical developments since his time.Figure 1Image [../images/f0373_01.jpg] Image [../images/f0374_01.jpg]The importance of these figures is strengthened by the cultural and politicalforces that produced them. Mills believed that any conflict between militarydefinitions of reality and popular American tendencies toward isolationism wouldbe resolved in favor of the former. Yet it seems clear that in the 1990s,opposition to military adventures abroad has severely curtailed the ability ofthe military to have its way in both foreign and domestic policy. Most Americansjust want to get on with the business of making enough money to lead the bestlives they can. Their opposition to higher taxes makes it impossible for themilitary to grow. The rhetoric of emergency—and with it the need for significantpersonal sacrifice—is not a rhetoric to which they are attracted. Not only arethey generally unwilling to see their children go to war, they are evenreluctant to support a compulsory peacetime draft.Changes like these suggest that the role of the military in American life hasbeen not so much reversed as modified. Strategists continue to plan possiblewars, even if they try their best to do so in ways that avoid the use ofAmerican troops. Efforts are made to recruit young people into military service,but only by emphasizing how such steps would help their careers, not theircountry. The Department of Defense continues to provide funds for scientific andtechnological innovation, but possible civilian uses of those innovations arestressed. The Republican party calls for a stronger America, but it is also aparty whose leaders criticized President Clinton’s military moves in Iraq duringthe impeachment controversies at the end of 1998. America has not returned tothe dramatic isolationism that characterized much of its history before Millswrote The Power Elite. But it would not be correct to say that we have witnessedthe dramatic (and dangerous) military ascendancy described by Mills in 1956.And how could we have? Business firms, still the most powerful force in Americanlife, are increasingly global in its nature, more interested in protecting theirprofits wherever they are made than in the defense of the country in whichperhaps a minority of its employees live and work. Give most of the leaders ofAmerica’s largest companies a choice between invading another country andinvesting in its industries, they would nearly always choose the latter ratherthan the former. Mills believed that in the 1950s, for the first time inAmerican history, the military elite had formed a strong alliance with theeconomic elite. Now it would be more correct to say that America’s economicelite finds more in common with economic elites in other countries than it doeswith the military elite of its own country. The Power Elite failed to foresee asituation in which at least one of the key elements of the power elite would nolonger identify its fate with the fate of the country that spawned it.4Politicians and public officials who wield control over the executive andlegislative branches of government constitute the third leg of the power elite.Mills believed that the politicians of his time no longer were required to servea local apprenticeship before moving up the ladder to national politics. Becausecorporations and the military had become so interlocked with government, andbecause both of those were national institutions, what might be called “thenationalization of politics” was bound to follow. The new breed of politicalfigure likely to climb to the highest political positions in the land would bethose who were cozy with generals and CEOS, not those who were on a first-namebasis with real estate brokers and savings and loan officials.Mills believed that at the time he wrote, ‘the politician must rely on the massmedia, and access to these media is expensive.’ But not even Mills could havepredicted how expensive it would become to run for office half a century later.Television has become a factor in political campaigns to a degree unimaginableto those used to watching three black and white channels on a nine-inch screen.Campaigns are longer, more partisan, and generally more competitive than theywere when Mills wrote. Engaged in a permanent campaign for office, politicianshave had to become full-time fund raisers. And, in order to finance theirefforts, they must turn to those who can afford to pay for them. While laborunions remain an important source of those funds, especially for Democrats,politicians of both parties, incumbents as well as challengers, find the bulk oftheir financial support from corporations. When companies provide those funds,they rarely do so out of a sense of civic duty. The list of things thatgovernment can provide for business is nearly as long as the list of thingsbusiness does not want government to be involved with. None of this means thatcorporations give money with the explicit quid pro quo that politicians willpass laws that will line their pockets. But it does mean that because politicsis so expensive, corporations, in all likelihood, have more power overcongressmen now than they did when Mills wrote his book.For Mills, politics was primarily a façade in any case. Historically speaking,American politics had been organized on the theory of balance: each branch ofgovernment would balance the other; competitive parties would insure adequaterepresentation; and interest groups like labor unions would serve as acounterweight to other interests like business. But the emergence of the powerelite had transformed the theory of balance in a romantic Jeffersonian myth. Soantidemocratic had America become under the rule of the power elite, accordingto Mills, that most decisions were made behind the scenes. As a result, neitherCongress nor the political parties had much substantive work to carry out. ‘Inthe absence of policy differences of consequences between the major parties,’Mills wrote, ‘the professional party politician must invent themes about whichto talk.’Mills was right to emphasize the irrelevance of eighteenth- and nineteenthcentury images to the actualities of twentieth century American political power.But he was not necessarily correct that politics would therefore becomesomething of an empty theatrical show. Mills believed that in the absence ofreal substance, the parties would become more like each other. Yet today theideological differences between Republicans and Democrats are severe—as, infact, they were in 1956. Joseph McCarthy, the conservative anti-Communistsenator from Wisconsin who gave his name to the period in which Mills wrote hisbook, appears a few times in The Power Elite, but not as a major figure. In hisemphasis on politics and economics, Mills underestimated the important role thatpowerful symbolic and moral crusades have had in American life, includingMcCarthy’s witch-hunt after communist influence. Had he paid more attention toMcCarthyism, Mills would have been more likely to predict such events as the1998–99 effort by Republicans to impeach President Clinton, the role played bydivisive issues such as abortion, immigration, and affirmative action inAmerican politics, and the continued importance of negative campaigning. Realsubstance may not be high on the American political agenda, but that does notmean that politics is unimportant. Through our political system, we makedecisions about what kind of people we imagine ourselves to me, which is why itmatters a great deal at the end of the twentieth century which political partyis in power.5How, then, does The Power Elite stand in retrospect? Should it be considered aclassic? Can it be read as a guide for the present as well as an explanation ofthe past? I believe that answers to these questions hang on the fact that ThePower Elite is really two books. In the first of these books (chapters 1 through10), Mills writes in a somewhat clinical language aimed at describing thestructure of power in America. This part of the book is driven by data and makesuse of extensive original research. Having presented his case, Mills then (inchapters 11 through 15) shifts to a language of outrage. It is in these chaptersthat some of Mills’ most famous phrases—‘crackpot realism,’ ‘the higherignorance’—appear. Here he sounds like a biblical prophet, foreshadowing doomand harshly denouncing ‘the second rate mind’ and the ‘ponderously spokenplatitude,’ This is Mills the social critic, leaving descriptive science behindto make his feelings about the power elite quite prominent.Contemporary commentators believe that Mills was an outstanding social criticbut not necessarily a first-rate social scientist. Yet I believe that The PowerElite survives better as a work of social science than of social criticism.At the time Mills was writing, academic sociology was in the process ofproclaiming itself a science. The proper role of the sociologist, many of Mills’colleagues believed, was to conduct value-free research emphasizing the closeempirical testing of small-bore hypotheses. A grand science would eventually bebuilt upon extensive empirical work that, like the best of the natural sciences,would be published in highly specialized journals emphasizing methodologicalinnovation and technical proficiency. Because he never agreed with theseobjectives—indeed, Mills wrote scathing critiques of scientific sociology—Millswas never considered a good scientist by his sociological peers.Yet not much of the academic sociology of the 1950s has survived, while ThePower Elite is rivaled by only very few books of its period in terms oflongevity. In his own way, Mills contributed much to the understanding of hisera. Social scientists of the 1950s emphasized pluralism, a concept that Millsattacked in his criticisms of the theory of balance. The dominant idea of theday was that the concentration of power in America ought not be consideredexcessive because one group always balanced the power of others. The biggestproblem facing America was not concentrated power but what sociologists began tocall “the end of ideology.” America, they believed, had reached a point in whichgrand passions over ideas were exhausted. From now on, we would requiretechnical expertise to solve our problems, not the musings of intellectuals.Compared to such ideas, Mills’ picture of American reality, for all itsexaggerations, seems closer to the mark. If the test of science is to getreality right, the very passionate convictions of C. Wright Mills drove him todevelop a better scientific grasp on American society than his more objectiveand clinical contemporaries. We can, therefore, read The Power Elite as a fairlygood account of what was taking place in America at the time it was written.As a social critic, however, Mills leave something to be desired. In that role,Mills portrays himself as a lonely battler for the truth, insistent upon hiscorrectness no matter how many others are seduced by the siren calls of power orwealth. This gives his book emotional power, but it comes at the cost of acertain irresponsibility. ‘In America today,’ Mills wrote in a typical passage,‘men of affairs are not so much dogmatic as they are mindless.’ Yet however onemay dislike the decisions made by those in power in the 1950s, asdecision-makers they were responsible for the consequences of their acts. It isoften easier to criticize from afar than it is to get a sense of what itactually means to make a corporate decision involving thousands of workers, toconsider a possible military action that might cost lives, or to decide whetherpublic funds should be spent on roads or welfare. In calling public officialsmindless, Mills implies that he knows how they might have acted better. But ifhe did, he never told readers of The Power Elite, for missing from the book is astatement of what could concretely be done to make the world accord more withthe values in which Mills believed.It is, moreover, one thing to attack the power elite, yet another to extend hiscriticisms to other intellectuals—and even the public at large. When he does thelatter, Mills runs the risk of becoming as antidemocratic as he believed Americahad become. As he brings his book to an end, Mills adopts a term once stronglyidentified with conservative political theorists. Appalled by the spread ofdemocracy, conservative European writers proclaimed the twentieth century as theage of ‘mass society.’ The great majority, this theory held, would never actrationally but would respond more like a crowd, hysterically caught up in frenzyat one point, apathetic and withdrawn at another. ‘The United States is notaltogether a mass society,’ Mills wrote, but he then went on to write as if itwere. And when he did, the image he conveyed of what an American had become wasthoroughly unattractive: “He loses his independence, and more importantly, heloses the desire to be independent; in fact, he does not have hold of the ideaof being an independent individual with his own mind and his own worked-out wayof life.” Mills had become so persuaded of the power of the power elite that heseemed to have lost all hope that the American people could find themselves andput a stop to the abuses he detected.This tone of resigned bitterness can come across to a contemporary reader asarrogant, as if Mills and Mills alone were the only one capable of seeing atruth impenetrable to everyone else. Good social criticism requires attachmentas well as alienation. One must identify with and even admire something beforeit makes sense to expend one’s energies criticizing it. That sense of engagementwith America once sparked writers like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walt Whitman tohold their country up to a higher standard. All too often Mills does not sharetheir generous sense of American life and writes instead as cantankerous critic,sour in his anger, rejectionist in his views of the world around him. For thatreason, if for no other, Mills the social critic is not always as effective asMills the social scientist.In pointing out some of the problems of The Power Elite, I am not suggestingthat the book fails to live up to its reputation as a contemporary classic; thebest honor one can give a social critic is criticism. Generations of studentsand informed readers have been stimulated by their reading of The Power Elite tothink about the kind of society they have and the kind of society they mightwant. The book deserves to be read by every new generation, for it reminds us ofthe importance of bringing our analytic powers together with our passionatecommitments—an essential task if one wants to be an informed and caring citizen.The publication of Mills’ book did not change the composition or the characterof the power elite. But it did bring its existence to light, no smallaccomplishment for a professor of sociology somewhat marginal to the disciplinewhich spawned him.FOR FURTHER READINGOne indicator of the importance of Mills’ book was that it spurred other socialscientists and social critics to carry forward studies of power in the UnitedStates. This, in turn, led to numerous scholarly debates over such questions aswhether the most influential people in America should be called a power elite ora ruling class; whether business; dominated government or whether governmentretained some autonomy from business; whether it was possible for democraticgovernments to pass laws that run counter to the interests of business; whetherthe military or civilians dominated the making of foreign policy; and whetheradditional institutions—education, entertainment, sports—needed to be added tothe three discussed by Mills.The leading figures writing roughly within the tradition that Mills establishedinclude G. William Domhoff, The Higher Circles: The Governing Class in America(New York: Random House, 1970) and Michael Schwartz and Beth Mintz, The PowerStructure of American Business (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1985).David Vogel’s Fluctuating Fortunes: The Political Power of Business in America(New York: Basic Books, 1989) treats business power not necessarily as a givenbut as something business can gain—and lose. Many scholars these days lean tothe position that business does not always get what it wants in politics, forthe government, in their view, has its own degrees of autonomy; see, forexample, Peter B. Evans, Dietrich Rueschemeyer, and Theda Skocpol, eds.,Bringing the State Back In (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1985). Mills’understanding of the managerial character of the business elite ought to besupplemented with a reading of Steven Brint, In an Age of Experts: The ChangingRole of the Professions in America (Princeton, N. J.: Princeton UniversityPress, 1994).A study that tries to bring Mills’ ideas about the military up to date is JohnL. Boies, Buying for Armageddon: Business, Society, and Military Spending Sincethe Cuban Missile Crisis (New Brunswick, N. J.: Rutgers University Press, 1994).At least one recent book strongly disagrees with Mills’ characterization of themilitary as antidemocratic, pointing out, for example, that the armed forces isone of the few places in America where extensive racial integration has takenplace: Charles C. Moskos and John Sibley Butler, All That We Can Be: BlackLeadership and Racial Integration the Army Way (New York: Basic Books, 1996).Some recent works on the role that money and corporate power play in shaping thenature of the political elite include Thomas Ferguson, Golden Rule: TheInvestment Theory of Party Competition and the Logic of Money-Driven PoliticalSystems (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995) and Ronald Frederick King,Money, Time, and Politics: Investment Tax Subsidies and American Democracy (NewHaven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1993). Some scholars point out, however,that business often wants contradictory things, thereby making it impossible forthe state to serve as a direct servant of the corporate elite. See Cathie J.Martin, Shifting the Burden: The Struggle over Growth and Corporate Taxation(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991).Two recent books deal with social criticism, addressing such questions as whatmakes it effective and its relationship to social science: Michael Walzer, Inthe Company of Critics: Social Criticism and Political Commitment in theTwentieth Century (New York: Basic Books, 1988) and Alan Wolfe, Marginalized inthe Middle (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996)."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSNEITHER the very top nor the very bottom of modern society is a normal part ofthe world of those who read and write books; we are more familiar with themiddle ranks. To understand the middle classes we have only to see what isactually around us, but to understand the very top or the very bottom, we mustfirst seek to discover and describe. And that is very difficult to do: the verytop of modern society is often inaccessible, the very bottom often hidden.The terms of such national surveys as are undertaken are far too gross to catchsuch numerically fine groups as make up the American elite; much publicinformation about their character and their activities is systematicallymisleading; and they are themselves busy and aloof and even secretive. Were weto select our field of study according to the ready availability of muchunworked material, we should never choose the elite. And yet, if we are tryingto understand something of the true nature of the society in which we live, wecannot allow the impossibility of rigorous proof to keep us from studyingwhatever we believe to be important. We must expect fumbles when, withoutauthority or official aid, we set out to investigate something which is in partorganized for the purpose of causing fumbles among those who would understand itplainly. Yet, by asserting what we can under such conditions, we may engage themand their agents in controversy, and thus learn more.Our desire for tight proof and our genuine need for facts do not at all meanthat reasoning together is not still a very important part of the proper way ofarriving at the truth. A book of this sort consists of three conversations:There is the conversation which the writer has with himself and with imaginarypersons, which is here recorded. Underneath this, there is going on, whether thewriter knows it or not, a conversation between certain influential thinkers andobservers whose views have filtered into his mind and into the minds of hisreaders. And also, in the minds of his readers there is going on anotherunspoken conversation with themselves and with him—a conversation in which eachconfronts what is written here with what he has experienced or found out. One ofthe jobs of the writer, accordingly, is to try to get as much of these twounspoken conversations as he can into his written work. In reasoning togetherwith his readers, he does more than set forth his views. He also clarifies them,and in doing so, becomes aware of ideas he did not even know he had.We do not want to so busy ourselves with details that we take the world in whichthey exist for granted. We neither take the world for granted nor believe it tobe a simple fact. Our business is with facts only in so far as we need them toupset or to clinch our ideas. Facts and figures are only the beginning of theproper study. Our main interest is in making sense of the facts we know or canreadily find out. We do not want merely to take an inventory, we want todiscover meanings, for most of our important questions are questions of meaning.We have, of course, gotten outside the dialogue by which we reason together andfound out what we could by various kinds of special study, the results of whichwe have introduced into the conversation going on in ‘our inner city.’ There aregood reasons why we should adopt just this essay-like way of reasoningtogether—especially for such a sprawling and controversial topic. In aconvenient, and I hope fruitful, way it enables us to bring together aneffective variety of viewpoints and skills, and it allows us to invite thereader to become a member of our dialogue about the higher circles of America.Funds for the research that has gone into this book were provided by ColumbiaUniversity’s Social Science Research Council and I am glad to thank mycolleagues for their aid. Funds were also supplied by The Oxford UniversityPress, New York, which has in fact gone beyond the ordinary office of publisherin helping me get on with this as well as other books. A first draft of thematerials was completed while in residence as a visitor at Brandeis Universityduring the spring of 1953 and I wish to thank my friends of that institution fortheir many kindnesses. During the summer of 1954, my wife and I were residentfellows at the Huntington Hartford Foundation of Pacific Palisades, California,and I am grateful to the fellows of that foundation for making the summer’s workboth pleasant and profitable.My wife, Ruth Harper Mills, as chief researcher and editorial adviser, hasshaped much of the book. Walter Klink, Paul Lucas, and William Taber haveassisted me by writing research memoranda. I wish also to thank Mrs. KatherineStanton for her secretarial services; without her there would be no book butonly a chaotic file of manuscript.Several individuals who know at first hand the Federal government, the military,or large corporations have helped me enormously. Without their help this bookwould be much the poorer, which makes all the more onerous to me the fact thatat their request I cannot acknowledge their help by name.Other friends who have generously given me the benefit of their advice include:Lewis Coser, Louis Friedland, Herbert Gold, Richard Hofstadter, Irving Howe,Floyd Hunter, Paolo Milano, Harry L.

[ch01.html#ch1en1a] Jacob Burckhardt, Force and Freedom (New York: PantheonBooks, 1943), pp. 303 ff.2. [ch01.html#ch1en2a] Cf. Hans Gerth and C. Wright Mills, Character and SocialStructure (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1953), pp. 457 ff.3. [ch01.html#ch1en3a] The statistical idea of choosing some value and callingthose who have the most of it an elite derives, in modern times, from theItalian economist, Pareto, who puts the central point in this way: ‘Let usassume that in every branch of human activity each individual is given an indexwhich stands as a sign of his capacity, very much the way grades are given inthe various subjects in examinations in school. The highest type of lawyer, forinstance, will be given 10. The man who does not get a client will be given1—reserving zero for the man who is an out-and-out idiot. To the man who hasmade his millions—honestly or dishonestly as the case may be—we will give 10. Tothe man who has earned his thousands we will give 6; to such as just manage tokeep out of the poor-house, 1, keeping zero for those who get in … So let usmake a class of people who have the highest indices in their branch of activity,and to that class give the name of elite.’ Vilfredo Pareto, The Mind and Society(New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1935), par. 2027 and 2031. Those who follow thisapproach end up not with one elite, but with a number corresponding to thenumber of values they select. Like many rather abstract ways of reasoning, thisone is useful because it forces us to think in a clear-cut way. For a skillfuluse of this approach, see the work of Harold D. Lasswell, in particular,Politics: Who Gets What, When, How (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1936); and for a moresystematic use, H. D. Lasswell and Abraham Kaplan, Power and Society (New Haven:Yale University Press, 1950).4. [ch01.html#ch1en4a] The conception of the elite as members of a top socialstratum, is, of course, in line with the prevailing common-sense view ofstratification. Technically, it is closer to ‘status group’ than to ‘class,’ andhas been very well stated by Joseph A. Schumpeter, ‘Social Classes in anEthically Homogeneous Environment,’ Imperialism and Social Classes (New York:Augustus M. Kelley, Inc., 1951), pp. 133 ff., especially pp. 137–47. Cf. alsohis Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, 3rd ed. (New York: Harper, 1950), PartII. For the distinction between class and status groups, see From Max Weber:Essays in Sociology (trans. and ed. by Gerth and Mills; New York: OxfordUniversity Press, 1946). For an analysis of Pareto’s conception of the elitecompared with Marx’s conception of classes, as well as data on France, seeRaymond Aron, ‘Social Structure and Ruling Class,’ British Journal of Sociology,vol. I, nos. 1 and 2 (1950).5. [ch01.html#ch1en5a] The most popular essay in recent years which defines theelite and the mass in terms of a morally evaluated character-type is probablyJosé Ortega y Gasset’s, The Revolt of the Masses, 1932 (New York: New AmericanLibrary, Mentor Edition, 1950), esp. pp. 91 ff.6. [ch01.html#ch1en6a] ‘The American elite’ is a confused and confusing set ofimages, and yet when we hear or when we use such words as Upper Class, Big Shot,Top Brass, The Millionaire Club, The High and The Mighty, we feel at leastvaguely that we know what they mean, and often do. What we do not often do,however, is connect each of these images with the others; we make little effortto form a coherent picture in our minds of the elite as a whole. Even when, veryoccasionally, we do try to do this, we usually come to believe that it is indeedno ‘whole’; that, like our images of it, there is no one elite, but many, andthat they are not really connected with one another. What we must realize isthat until we do try to see it as a whole, perhaps our impression that it maynot be is a result merely of our lack of analytic rigor and sociologicalimagination.The first conception defines the elite in terms of the sociology ofinstitutional position and the social structure these institutions form; thesecond, in terms of the statistics of selected values; the third, in terms ofmembership in a clique-like set of people; and the fourth, in terms of themorality of certain personality types. Or, put into inelegant shorthand: whatthey head up, what they have, what they belong to, who they really are.In this chapter, as in this book as a whole, I have taken as generic the firstview—of the elite defined in terms of institutional position—and have locatedthe other views within it. This straight-forward conception of the elite has onepractical and two theoretical advantages. The practical advantage is that itseems the easiest and the most concrete ‘way into’ the whole problem—if onlybecause a good deal of information is more or less readily available forsociological reflection about such circles and institutions.But the theoretical advantages are much more important. The institutional orstructural definition, first of all, does not force us to prejudge by definitionthat we ought properly to leave open for investigation. The elite conceivedmorally, for example, as people having a certain type of character is not anultimate definition, for apart from being rather morally arbitrary, it leads usimmediately to ask why these people have this or that sort of character.Accordingly, we should leave open the type of characters which the members ofthe elite in fact turn out to have, rather than by definition select them interms of one type or another. In a similar way, we do not want, by meredefinition, to prejudge whether or not the elite are conscious members of asocial class. The second theoretical advantage of defining the elite in terms ofmajor institutions, which I hope this book as a whole makes clear, is the factthat it allows us to fit the other three conceptions of the elite into place ina systematic way: (1) The institutional positions men occupy throughout theirlifetime determine their chances to get and to hold selected values. (2) Thekind of psychological beings they become is in large part determined by thevalues they thus experience and the institutional roles they play. (3) Finally,whether or not they come to feel that they belong to a select social class, andwhether or not they act according to what they hold to be its interests—theseare also matters in large part determined by their institutional position, andin turn, the select values they possess and the characters they acquire.7. [ch01.html#ch1en7a] As in the case, quite notably, of Gaetano Mosca, TheRuling Class (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1939). For a sharp analysis of Mosca, seeFritz Morstein Marx, ‘The Bureaucratic State,’ Review of Politics, vol. I, 1939,pp. 457 ff.

[ch01.html#ch1en9a] Some of these items are taken from Gerth and Mills,Character and Social Structure, pp. 405 ff. On role-determined androle-determining men, see also Sidney Hook’s discussion, The Hero in History(New York: John Day, 1943).10. [ch01.html#ch1en10a] I have taken the idea of the following kind offormulation from Joseph Wood Krutch’s presentation of the morality of choice.See The Measure of Man (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1954), p. 52.2. LOCAL SOCIETY1. [ch02.html#ch2en1a] Much of this chapter is based upon my own observationsand interviews in some dozen middle-sized cities in the Northeast, theMiddle-West, and the South. Some results of this work have appeared in ‘SmallBusiness and Civic Welfare, Report of the Smaller War Plants Corporation to theSpecial Committee to Study Problems of American Small Business,’ (with MelvilleJ. Ulmer), Senate Document No. 135, 79th Cong., 2nd Session, Washington, 1946;‘The Middle Classes in Middle-sized Cities,’ American Sociological Review,October 1946; and White Collar: The American Middle Classes (New York: OxfordUniversity Press, 1951). I have also used field notes made during the course ofan intensive study of a city of 60,000 in Illinois during the summer of 1945.Unless otherwise noted, all quotations in this chapter are from my own research.I have also drawn upon a memorandum, prepared for me by Mr. J. W. Harless, inwhich all statements about local upper classes appearing in the followingstudies were organized: Robert S. Lynd and Helen M. Lynd, Middletown (New York:Harcourt, Brace, 1929) and Middle-town in Transition (New York: Harcourt, Brace,1937); Elin L. Anderson, We Americans (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard UniversityPress, 1938); Hortense Powdermaker, After Freedom (New York: The Viking Press,1939); John Dollard, Caste and Class in a Southern Town, 2nd ed.

Lunt, The Social Life of a ModernCommunity (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1941), volume I of the Yankee CitySeries; Allison Davis and Burleigh B. Gardner and Mary R. Gardner, Deep South(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1941); Liston Pope, Millhands andPreachers (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1942); John Useem, Pierre Tangent,and Ruth Useem, ‘Stratification in a Prairie Town,’ American SociologicalReview, July 1942; James West, Plainville, U.S.A.

Hill and Bevode C.McCall, ‘Social Stratification in “Georgia-town,’” American Sociological Review,December 1950; and Alfred Winslow Jones, Life, Liberty and Property(Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott, 1941).Most local community studies of prestige, so often the unit of sociologicalstudy, are of merely local interest. One cannot even say that they are ofinterest beyond that because of the methodological innovations they makepossible, for in truth most of these methodological advancements are suitableonly for what they have been worked out for—local community studies.It is interesting to notice that in examining the small American city, bothnovelist and sociologist have, each in his own way, been interested in similardetails and reached quite similar conclusions. They have both generally beenmore interested in status than in power. The novelist has been more interestedin manners and in the frustrating effects of smalltown life on human relationsand personality; the sociologist has not paid very full attention to the smallcity as a structure of power, much less as a unit in a system of power that isnation-wide. The similarity of their descriptive effects is revealed by the factthat, despite the rituals of proof they contain, the endless ‘community studies’of the sociologists often read like badly written novels; and the novels, likebetter-written sociology.2.

[ch04.html#ch4en9a] ‘By and large, branch by branch, family by family, theBostonian of today has withdrawn from productive enterprise. He has lost theactive management of his industries. He has lost the political control of hiscity. He is no longer a figure, as he was a dominant figure a hundred years ago,in the government of the nation. He no longer leads either in public opinion orin private thought. And he has so completely lost his leadership in the artsthat his former influence has become a subject for satire.’ But ‘no great Bostonfamily of the first rank has lost either means or position. No real break hasbeen made in the city’s ruling class. And all the laws of economic determinismseem to have been violated in that fact. … At present, by the supplementarydevice of giving trustees discretion to pay or not to pay income as they see thenecessity, a Massachusetts estate may be tied up beyond the reach of any powerbut the Communist International. But it was already possible three generationsago to expedite one’s fortune safely into eternity—or into so much of eternityas the Rule Against Perpetuities left open. And Boston families early formed thehabit—a habit in which the highly reputed Suffolk County Bar and the helpfulprovisions of the Massachusetts laws on trustee investments confirmed them.Fortunately—or unfortunately—for Boston they formed the habit in the days oftheir wealth … Time cannot wither nor custom stale their infinite variety ofsound investments. Social power is theirs. Civilization is theirs. But shouldthey attempt to strike back through the mirror into the world of actual powerthey would bleed to death. Farther forward and in the focus of living authorityis the great banking unity, the First National. Below it in various relations offinancial dependence are the Boston industries. Above it, in a somewhat shadowyperspective, are the individuals who control it … To the side, and in noapparent relation either to the financial web or to the social, stands thepolitical hierarchy … And above the political hierarchy but in no apparentrelation to it other than the relation established by a common blood and acommon religion stands the Irish Catholic hierarchy of the city … There aredoubtless mysterious threads and channels which lead from one focus of power toanother. Certainly there are rumors enough of such connectives … There is noagreement. Or if there is agreement it is agreement upon the single point thatno threads of power, save the threads which bind Harvard College to the sternsof the clipper ships, lead to the Bostonians.’ ‘Boston,’ Fortune, February 1933,pp. 27 ff.10.

Kelley, 1953), which reprints twolistings of American millionaires—from the Tribune Monthly, June 1892 and theWorld Almanac, 1902. These lists are of little use in the attempt to list thevery rich (see footnote 9 below) since only rarely is an estimate of the exactsize of the fortune given; examination of this list shows that hundreds of ‘meremillionaires’ appear alongside John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie.9. [ch05.html#ch5en9a] In a country which, as Ferdinand Lundberg once remarked,‘literally flaunts a chaos of statistics about subjects of little generalinterest,’ there are no precise figures on the great fortunes. To list the namesof the richest people of three generations, I have had to do the best that Icould with such unsystematic sources as are available. I have, of course,availed myself of all the histories of great fortunes in the United States, aswell as the biographies of those who possessed them. Twice in the twentiethcentury—1924 and 1938—rather systematic information has been published on largeincomes or big properties (see below); and there is an intermittent stream ofinformation and myth appearing in newspapers and magazines, the facts of aprobated will, the tax scandal, the anecdote about rich individuals.I began with a list of all persons mentioned in the books listed below who wereborn after 1799 and who were stated to have ever possessed $30 million or more.In many cases, the size of the fortune was not estimated in the source of thename; but taking note of all possible names, we searched all the sources at handfor estimations of the size of fortune. The general criterion of $30 million ismainly a matter of convenience. We found that such a criterion will yield 371names: since it was necessary to compile detailed information about the fortuneand the career of each of these individuals, our resources did not permit us tohandle a larger list. Here are the sources used:(I) Gustavus Myers, History of the Great American Fortunes, 1907 (revised ModernLibrary edition, 1936). (II) Gustavus Myers, The Ending of Hereditary Fortunes(New York: Julian Messner, 1939). (III) Matthew Josephson, The Robber Barons(New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1934). (IV) Frederick Lewis Allen, The Lords ofCreation (New York: Harper, 1935). (V) Ferdinand Lundberg, America’s 60Families, 1937 (New York: The Citadel Press, 1946)-our cautious use of this bookis discussed below in (XI). (VI) Dixon Wecter, The Saga of American Society (NewYork: Scribner’s 1937). (VII) ‘Richest U.S. Women,’ Fortune, November 1936(VIII) Stewart H. Holbrook, The Age of the Moguls (New York: Doubleday, 1953).Based in considerable detail upon Myers’ work and those of other historians,this work is mainly a popularization of earlier work, (IX) ‘Noted Americans ofthe Past: American Industrial Leaders, Financiers and Merchants,’ World Almanac,1952, p. 381, and 1953, p. 783. Does not include estimates of fortunes, (X)Cleveland Amory, The Last Resorts (New York: Harper, 1952). There are naturallymany duplications of people mentioned in these sources; but each one of them hasyielded information unmentioned by all the others.Three further sources require more detailed discussion:(XI) In 1924 and again in 1925, a temporary law allowed the release ofinformation on the size of income-tax payments made on incomes for 1923 and1924. Journalists were admitted to various offices of the Bureau of InternalRevenue and there copied names with the taxes paid by each. The release of thisdata was so administratively sloppy that one paper published data about a manwhom another paper ignored, some errors were printed, and in some cases alljournalists missed the names of people who were known to have paid large taxes.(There were, of course, some wealthy people whose entire income was tax free.Selecting the 1924 income tax list for study, we took everyone who had paid$200,000 or more in taxes as listed in either or in both The New York Times orThe New York Herald Tribune, 2 to 15 September 1925.The average tax at this time and at these levels resulted in a payment of about40 per cent of the gross income; so a payment of $200,000 reveals an annualincome during 1924 of about $500,000. Since most such high incomes are derivedfrom investments, an overall figure of 5 per cent return on investment wouldmean that for one to obtain a half million dollars from investments, the capitalowned would have to be about $10 million. It has been presumed that only aboutone-third of most entire fortunes were at that time in taxable sources; hence,the over-all fortune owned would be three times larger than the taxable fortune.(These are the calculations Ferdinand Lundberg made on the 1924 returns in hisbook cited above. He comments that ‘in individual instances the multiplicationby three of the net fortune upon whose income a tax was paid may result in somedistortion, but this appears to be the only way in which to obtain a generalapproximation; and as the method gives generally accurate results, the pictureas a whole is not overdrawn. Rather it is very conservative.’ (p. 25.) I thinkthis is so.) By these calculations, then, a tax of $200,000 indicates an incomeof $500,000, a taxable fortune of 10 million, and an entire fortune of 30million.Most evidence from those estates that were probated shortly after 1924 showsthat these calculations are reasonably accurate. For instance, according tothese calculations, the $434,000 tax payment of Richard Teller Crane, Jr.,indicated a total fortune of $64.8 million; he died in 1931 leaving an estate of50 million. Ogden Mills’ tax payment of $372,000 would indicate a fortune of55.5 million in 1924; he died in 1929 leaving 41 million. There are, of course,cases in which people’s estates were much less, but they usually were known tohave lost their money (such as grain speculator Arthur W. Cutten who was wipedout in the 1929 crash) or given it away before their death. I included suchpeople as long as they were at any one time in possession of $30 million. I knowof no systematic use of these names. Ferdinand Lundberg, in 1937, compiled alist of ‘60 families’ which, in fact, are not all families and which number—as‘families’—not 60, but about 74. But he does not analyze them systematically. By‘systematic’ I understand that similar information is compiled for each personon the list and generalizations made therefrom.What Lundberg does is (1) generalize blood relations-sometimes cousinhoodonly—into power and financial cliques. We do not wish to confuse the two. Inaddition (2), we cannot go along with the list he has abstracted from The NewYork Times, which is not uniformly made up of families or individuals orcompanies but is a miscellany.Of the so-called 60 families, there are 37 ‘families’ represented by more thanone member’s tax payments. There are eight unrelated men included along with theMorgans; and there is another group of seven families forming his 38th ‘family’(this is the ‘Standard Oil Group’). The list is filled out with 22 individualspaying 1924 taxes ranging from $188,608 to $791,851. Thus, if ‘family’ is tomean a blood tie, there are many more than 60 families on his list; but the listis not even a full account of these families, since only those paying a taxunder the family name were included. Moreover, there are a number of people(e.g. J. H. Brewer, L. L. Cooke) who paid much higher taxes in 1924 than many ofthe people named by Lundberg but who are not included in his listing of ‘60families.’ Some, but not all, of these are not listed in The New York Times, butare in The New York Herald Tribune, which Mr. Lundberg seems to have ignored.More importantly for the purpose of obtaining a list of the top richest personsis the fact that some of the families in Lundberg’s list of the top 60 do noteven appear among the very rich when individuals are concerned. The Deerings,for instance: Lundberg uses three Deerings; the tax payment of all three adds upto $315,701. We do not include the Deerings on our list of the ‘very rich’ sinceJames Deering paid a tax of only $179,896; Charles, only $139,341; the thirdDeering, some $7,000. The same type of procedure holds for the Tafts, Lehmans,and deForests. They are all undoubtedly rich people, but not to the same degreeas the people in whom we are interested.(XII) A more recent systematic source of information regarding size of privatefortunes is the Temporary National Economic Committee’s Monograph No. 29: ‘TheDistribution of Ownership in the 200 Largest Non-Financial Corporations’(Washington: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1940). This monograph gives the 20largest stockholders of record in each of the 200 largest non-financialcorporations, along with the stockholdings of the directors and officers ofthese corporations, as of 1937 or 1938. Although it does contain most of thewell-known fortunes that are based upon industrial ownership, the list is notcomplete: it does not cover money held in government or local bonds, in realestate or in financial houses. Moreover, in a number of instances ownership evenof industrial corporations is disguised by the practice of recording theownership of a block of stock under various investment houses which do notdivulge the names of the actual owners. Nevertheless, this TNEC list representsthe best we have found for the later period. Compared with the scattered casestudies available for the nineteenth century, the wealthy it discloses are arather stable set of men.From this source I have taken each person for whom the total value of all sharesowned in all companies listed was equal to $10 million or more in 1937 or 1938.Multiplying this figure by three (assuming again that the taxable wealthrepresents only one-third of the total fortune owned), gives us all those peopleowning $30 million or more in the late ’thirties.(XIII) None of the sources above provide really up-to-date information about thevery rich. Many of the people named in the various books, and in the 1924 and1938 lists, are, of course, still alive; and we have found living heirs topeople now dead—through obituaries, we tried to trace the fortunes of all namesselected, and included in our list all those heirs whom we have found to haveinherited $30 million or more.(XIV) In order to obtain information about people now alive, the followingagencies and government bureaus were contacted—various officials in each of themgave us such information as they could, none of it ‘official,’ and none of muchuse to us: the Federal Reserve Board of New York; the Securities ExchangeCommission; U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Domestic Commerce; and theBureau of Internal Revenue’s Statistical Division and Information Division.Individuals were also contacted in the following private organizations: Dun &Bradstreet; The National Industrial Conference Board’s Division of BusinessEconomics; The Wall Street Journal; Barron’s; Fortune; The Russell SageFoundation; U.S. News and World Report; Brookings Institution; Bureau ofNational Affairs, Federal Savings and Loan; and two private investment houses.People seen in these organizations could only refer us to sources of which wewere already aware. Some had never thought much about the problem, others seemedslightly shocked at the idea of ‘finding out’ about the top wealthy people,others were enchanted with the idea but helpless as to sources. I am grateful toProfessor Fred Blum for making most of these contacts for us, and for hishelpful comments on this whole problem.(XV) During the post-World War II years, I have been searching current papersand periodicals for any mention of other multi-millionaires. From magazines suchas Business Week, Look and Life and Time and from The New York Times, I havepicked up additional names, mainly of the new crop of Texans. In this search foradditional names, I have had the benefit of about two dozen interested studentsand friends.Because of the necessarily miscellaneous character of the collection of names,we cannot be certain, and I do not claim, that the list includes all the richestpeople in America over the last 100 years; nor that all the people whom we haveincluded in our list have, in proven fact, possessed at one time or another, $30million.Two things, however, can be said with reasonable surety: (1) There is fairlygood evidence for the accuracy of the $30 million figure. In cases of people whohave died, I have checked by probate of will and found that these estimationsseem quite accurate. (2) Even though the list cannot be proved to exhaust therichest—including every single person who has owned the prescribed amounts—allof these people are undoubtedly among the richest people in the United States byany reasonable definition. Undoubtedly in our listing we have missed some whoshould have been included, and have included others who should not have been.But we have included all those people about whom printed information isavailable to us, and it is our opinion that such errors as might occur do notmaterially affect the picture. In short, no exact and proven list seems to uspossible; this list seems to us a quite reasonable approximation of the mostprominent very rich people in America over the last one hundred years.The foregoing outline of procedure, along with a preliminary listing of thenames selected, and a secondary listing of people we had designated as being oflesser wealth, were sent, for suggestions and criticisms to the following: Dr.John M. Blair of the Bureau of Industrial Economics, Federal Trade Commission;Professor Thomas Cochran of the University of Pennsylvania; Professor ShepardClough of Columbia University; Professors Arthur Cole, Leland H. Jenks, andSigmund O. Diamond of the Research Center of Entrepreneurial History at HarvardUniversity; Professors Joseph Dorfman and Robert S. Lynd of Columbia University;Professor Frank Freidel of Stanford University; Frank Fogarty of Business Week;Ernest Dale of the School of Business, Columbia University; and Max Lerner ofthe New York Post and Brandeis University. I wish to thank these people fortheir time, consideration and help on this problem, although they are in no wayresponsible for any errors of fact or judgement.Of the 371 names, I was unable to find, from a search of biographical sources,the books mentioned above, and newspaper files, any information about the lifeof 69 of them. More than half of these names came from the 1924 tax lists wherewe had only the last name and first initials to go by. The speculative nature ofmany large incomes during the ‘twenties would lead me to believe that thechances were high that many of these incomes did not represent durable greatfortunes; and our concern with the ‘most prominent’ very rich in America makesit feasible to omit these 69 people from the Very Rich. At any rate it wasnecessary.In an effort to make some allowance for the variance in the value of the dollarover the periods in which we are interested, I ranked the members of each of ourthree generations by the estimated sizes of their fortunes. Economic historianswhom I consulted have indicated that they ‘do not know of any satisfactorydevice for reducing a given amount of money to purchasing power equivalents overa long period of time’ (Letter to the author from Sigmund O. Diamond and LelandH. Jenks, 30 March 1954). Of course, when one gets into the multi-million-dollarcategories, the cost of living—which is usually the purpose of stablishingrelative purchasing power—is not a matter of concern.For each generation I took the 90 richest people. We are thus considering the 90or so most prominent and richest in each of the three historical epochs. Thisgives us a total of 275 cases for concentrated analysis, which is the upper 74per cent of the 371 cases mentioned by all sources known to us.Of the 90 cases selected as Group I, the median year of birth is 1841; themedian years of death, 1912. The year when the median age is 60 is therefore1901; hereafter Group I is identified as the 1900 generation.Of the 95 cases selected from Group II, the median year of birth is 1867; themedian year of death, 1936. The year when the median age is 60 is therefore1927; Group II thus consists of the 1925 generation.Of the 90 cases in Group III, the median year of birth is 1887; and most ofthese were still alive in 1954. On the average they were 60 in 1947; Group IIIis thus the 1950 generation.10. [ch05.html#ch5en10a] On John D.

William Henry Vanderbilt, son of theCommodore and dead by 1900, became a conservative manager of the Vanderbiltenterprises, and, in fact, was head of them when they reached their financialhigh point. It is, of course, difficult to know whether this was a result of hismanagement—which was neither speculative nor extravagant—or a result ofobjective changes resulting in the increased value of railroad securities. Theindolence of his sons, who spent more time in Europe playing a game of fashion,was perhaps less a cause of the relative decline of the Vanderbilt fortune thanthe downswing of the railroad economy. Cf. Wayne Andrews, The Vanderbilt Legend,New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1941. George D. Widener, son of P. A. B. Widener,became a stockholder in 23 companies and was president and director of 18. Hewas an active type of economic man in that he was involved in 1902 in a suit forfraud for praising a weak company so that he could sell his stock in it and getout before it failed. Cf. Philadelphia Public Ledger, 2 April 1912 andPhiladelphia Press, 23 September 1902.Of the modern-day family managers there is, for instance, Vincent Astor—thegreat-grandson of John Jacob Astor—who may be an enthusiast for yachting andautomobile racing, but he disappointed society editors in their search for theidle life of scandal when, at the death of his father, he quit Harvard and, atthe age of 21, began to improve the value of the Astor land in New York City.Young Vincent changed the management policy by abolishing many tenements andattempting to bring middle and upper-class clientele to Astor land, thus, ofcourse, increasing its value to him. Cf. Harvey O’Connor, The Astors, New York:Knopf, 1941, p. 336. And the daily decisions of John D. Rockefeller III involvethe disposition of millions of dollars; he has a full-time job for which he wastrained: philanthropic work on an international scope. Moreover, he has beenactive as a director in many American corporations, including the New York LifeInsurance Company and the Chase National Bank.18.

Since 1914 it has been illegal for a person to bethe director of two or more corporations if those corporations are incompetition; in 1951, the Federal Trade Commission argued that it wanted the lawamplified to include two or more corporations of a certain size regardless ofwhether or not they are in competition. ‘The present law is … unduly limited inits conception of the competition that may be prevented by interlockingdirectorates. The law applies only where there is or has been competitionbetween the interlocked companies. It does not apply where these companies mightreadily become competitors and probably would do so but for the effect of theinterlock … [The law] is applicable only to direct interlocks among competitors,whereas there are competition-reducing potentialities in indirect interlocks aswell.’ See Report of The Federal Trade Commission on Interlocking Directorates(Washington: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1951), esp. pp. 14–15.In 1950 there were 556 positions as director in the 25 largest corporations inAmerica. One man (Winthrop W. Aldrich), who is now the Ambassador to GreatBritain, held directorships in four of these companies (Chase National Bank,American Telephone and Telegraph Company, New York Central Railroad, andMetropolitan Life Insurance Company). Seven men each held directorships in threeof these companies; 40, in two companies; and 451 men held directorships in onlyone company. Thus, 105 of the 556 seats on the boards of these 25 companies wereheld by 48 men.

These bargains set the pattern ofwage contracts; thousands of other employers may go through the motions ofbargaining, but the odds are high that they will end up according to the patternset by the few giant deals.

Blair, ‘Technology and Size,’ AmericanEconomic Review, vol. XXXVIII, May 1948, Number 2, pp. 150–51. Blair argues thatpresent-day technology, unlike that of the nineteenth and the early twentiethcentury, is a force leading toward decentralization rather than consolidation.For new techniques—such as the replacement of steam by electricity and thereplacement of iron and steel by light metals, alloys, plastics, andplywood—reduce the scale of operations at which diminishing returns set in.Given these new technological developments, the maximum profitability of a plantwill be reached at a much lower scale of operations than heretofore. ‘In summary… it may be expected that the increased substitution of these new materials willreduce the amount of capital required per unit of product and thereby tend toresult in the establishment of newer, smaller, and more efficient plants.’ Ibid.p. 124.15.

Taussig and C. S. Joslyn broke the ground byobtaining information from about 7,000 businessmen listed in Poor’s 1928Register of Directors: American Business Leaders: A Study in Social Origins andSocial Stratification (New York: Macmillan, 1932).Mills analyzed 1,464 ‘eminent American businessmen’ whose biographies appearedin The Dictionary of American Biography and who were born between 1570 and 1879:‘The American Business Elite: A Collective Portrait,’ The Tasks of EconomicHistory, Supplement V to The Journal of Economic History, December 1945.William Miller has made the chief and the best collection of biographies ofbusiness leaders. He has personally analyzed these materials and published fourarticles on them: ‘American Historians and the Business Elite,’ Journal ofEconomic History, vol. IX, No. 2, November 1949, which compares 190 businessleaders of 1903 with their 188 political contemporaries; ‘The Recruitment of theBusiness Elite,’ Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. LXIV, No. 2, May 1950,which deals with the social origins of the business leaders of 1903 as comparedwith the general population; ‘American Lawyers in Business and Politics,’ YaleLaw Journal, vol. LX, No. 1, January 1951, which compares the socialcharacteristics of the lawyers found among the business leaders of 1903 withthose found among the politicians; and ‘The Business Bureaucracies: Careers ofTop Executives in the Early Twentieth Century,’ Men in Business: Essays in theHistory of Entrepreneurship (Edited by William Miller) (Cambridge: HarvardUniversity Press, 1952), which discusses the business careers of the businessmenof 1903. Mr. Miller also gathered biographical material on 412 business leadersof 1950.Under the direction of Miller at the Research Center in Entrepreneurial Historyat Harvard University, a similar study was undertaken on industrial leaders of1870–1879: see Frances W. Gregory and Irene D. Neu, ‘The American IndustrialElite in the 1870’s: Their Social Origins,’ Men in Business.An analysis of all three of these generations has been written by Suzanne I.Keller, ‘Social Origins and Career Lines of Three Generations of AmericanBusiness Leaders,’ Columbia University Ph.D. Thesis, 1954. Using an approachsimilar to that of Miller, Fortune magazine analyzed a group of 900 topexecutives in 1952—the three highest paid men in the 250 largest industrialcorporations, the 25 largest railroads and the 20 largest utilities: ‘The NineHundred,’ Fortune, November 1952, pp. 132 ff., which consists of the largestcontemporary sample available, good materials not adequately analyzed. Cf. alsoMabel Newcomer, ‘The Chief Executives of Large Business Corporations,’Explorations in Entrepreneurial History, Vol. V (Cambridge: Research Center forEntrepreneurial History at Harvard University, 1952–3), pp. 1–34, which dealswith the chief executives of corporations in 1899, 1923, and 1948.All such studies of career-lines, as well as others used in this book, are,however, readily liable to many technical difficulties of interpretation, theinformation needed is often very hard to come by, and one may quite easily bemisled. For example, the superficial ‘social origin’ of Senator Clifford Case ofNew Jersey, judged by his father’s occupation, is ‘pleasant but not prosperous’:he is the son of a Protestant minister who died when Clifford was sixteen. Hisuncle, however, was a state senator and, for 23 years, a state supreme courtjustice. (See Time, 18 October 1954, p. 21.) On the dangers inherent in usingsuch career-line statistical studies as predictions of the course of socialevents, see Richard H. S. Crossman, ‘Explaining the Revolution of Our Time: CanSocial Science Predict Its Course?’ Commentary, July 1952, pp. 77 ff.The figures used in Sections 2 and 3 of this chapter are, unless otherwisenoted, from Keller’s analysis of Miller’s data; in no case is this data usedunless it is commensurate with other relevant studies: we may thus take thosefigures presented in the text as representing a general consensus of all therelevant studies done.18.

[ch06.html#ch6en19a] As you extend the sample to more executives, theproportion of the top 900 executives in 1952 who graduated from college isroughly the same (about 65 per cent), but only about one-third of these have hadpost-graduate training. Of the youngest group of present-day executives—thoseunder 50 years of age—84 per cent have graduated from college. See ‘The NineHundred,’ op. cit., p. 135.20.

[ch06.html#ch6en23a] We do not know exactly for an adequate sample how longor how hard the executives work, but we do have a few recent facts about a smallgroup of West Coast executives, all of whom received salaries of $35,000 ormore; we are not given data on how much they cwn or get from dividends. Some 37out of this group of 111 men got to work at about 10 a.m., quit around 3 p.m.,‘took three-hour lunches, played golf or went fishing two or three times a week,often stretched their weekends to four or five days. All but five of this groupowned their own companies or were officers of small local businesses.’ Only 10men (nine per cent) worked a straight 40-hour week. But 64 (some 58 per cent)worked very hard indeed: ‘They were almost all employees of large nationalcorporations … They worked from 69 hours a week to as high as 112, and I meanall work … Most were in the office by 8, left at 6:30 with a pile of homework;when they went out to dinner (an average of three times a week), it was alwayson business.’ From a study done by Arthur Stanley Talbott, as reported in Time,10 November 1952, p. 109.24.

In the years prior to1944, individual incomes were not separated from estates and trusts.

[ch07.html#ch7en10a] Simon Kuznets, an expert with tax-derived data, findsthat the share in total income after taxes of the richest 1 per cent (which goesdown to families earning a mere $15,000) of the population has decreased from19.1 per cent in 1928 to 7.4 per cent in 1945; but he carefully adds: ‘It mustbe evident from our presentation that we encountered considerable difficulty incontructing estimates with a high degree of reliability and in unearthing datafor checking the several hypotheses.’ Yet, his are the figures upon which thegreat ‘leveling up’ and the ‘decline of the rich’ theories are popularly based.These figures involve a certain amount of ‘estimates’ and ‘adjustments’ whichcould be debated in great detail; but, the important debate ought to concern thedata from which they are ‘estimated.’ From what we know—and we know only a smallpart—of the legal and the illegal ways of the heavily taxed, we seriously wonderif the drop from 19.1 to 7.4 per cent is as much an illustration of how well thecorporate rich have learned to keep information about their income from thegovernment than of an ‘income revolution.’ No one, however, will ever reallyknow. For the kind of official investigation required is not politicallyfeasible. See Simon Kuznets, ‘Shares of Upper Income Groups in Income andSavings,’ National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc., Occasional Paper No. 35,pp. 67 and 59; and Simon Kuznets, assisted by Elizabeth Jenks, Shares of UpperIncome Groups in Income and Savings (New York: National Bureau of EconomicResearch, Inc., 1953). For one debate over the methods employed by Kuznets bymeans of a different interpretation of tax data, see J. Keith Butters, LawrenceE. Thompson and Lyn L. Bollinger, Effects of Taxation: Investment by Individuals(Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1953), especially p. 104.Incidentally, the proportion of income that goes for taxation of all kinds—whichmembers of the several income levels pay—has not recently been studied withcare. During the New Deal, however, the results of such a study by Gerhard Colmand Helen Tarasov for the TNEC (Monograph No. 3: ‘Who Pays theTaxes?’ seeespecially p. 6) revealed that a person earning from $1,500 to $2,000 a yearpaid 17.8 per cent of his income in taxes, and was only able to save 5.8 percent; while someone earning ten times that income ($15,000 to $20,000) had justless than twice as high proportion of his income taken away by taxes (31.7 percent) and was able to save over five times as high a proportion (32.3 per cent).11. [ch07.html#ch7en11a] Such cost deductions in any given year reduce theamount of ‘depletion allowance’ since they reduce the size of the net income;but they do not affect the percentage allowed for depletion.

The army registers from 1942 to 1953yielded 36 men, each of whom is a 4 or a 5 star general: George C. Marshall,Douglas MacArthur, Malin Craig, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Henry H. Arnold, Joseph W.Stilwell, Walter W. Krueger, Brehon B. Somervell, Jacob L. Devers, Mark W.Clark, Omar N. Bradley, Thomas T. Handy, Courtney H. Hodges, Jonathan M.Wainwright, Lucius D.

Fairchild, Joseph T.McNarney, George C. Kenny, Lauris Norstad, Benjamin Chidlaw, Curtis E. LeMay,John K. Cannon, Otto P. Weyland.The typical general of 1950 was born in the mean year of 1893 of Americanparents and is of British ancestry. It took him 35 years, from the first year atthe academy or the service, to reach his top command status or generalcy at theage of 52. His father was a professional and from the upper-middle class, andprobably had political friendships or connections. The typical general graduatedfrom West Point, besides graduating from four schools in the Army. If he isreligious, he is probably Protestant and maybe Episcopalian. He has married(endogomously) an upper-middle class girl and her father might have been aGeneral, a professional, or a businessman. He belongs to about three clubs,e.g., the Army-Navy, Army-Navy Country, and the Masons. He has written about twobooks and someone has written something about him. He has also received twohonorary degrees and probably expects to receive more.The 25 navy admirals and fleet admirals of 1950 selected were: Harold R. Stark,Ernest J. King, Chester W. Nimitz, Royal E. Ingersoll, William F. Halsey,Raymond A. Spruance, William D. Leahy, Jonas H. Ingram, Frederick J. Horne,Richard S. Edwards, Henry K. Hewitt, Thomas C. Kinkaid, Richoon K. Turner, JohnH. Towers, Dewitt C. Ramsey, Louis E. Denfield, Charles M. Coke, Richard L.Conolly, William H. P. Blandy, Forrest P. Sherman, Arthur W. Radford, William M.Fechteler, Robert B. Carney, Lynde D. McCormick, Donald B. Duncan.The Admiral of 1950 was born in the mean year of 1887, of American parents andis of British ancestry. It took 40 years to reach the top command post from theyear he entered the Naval Academy, and he was 58 when this occurred. He was bornsomewhere in the Eastern-North-Central section of the U.S. and grew up in themiddle Atlantic region. He was born in an urban area and his father was amilitary man when the admiral was about 17 years old. The father’s class levelat this time was upper-middle and the family might have had some key politicalconnections. He graduated from the Naval Academy and had some collegepreviously. While in service he graduated, also, from a specialty school, e.g.,the Naval War College (the top school for commanders and captains). His religionis Episcopalian and his father-in-law is from the upper-middle class and iseither in the professional or the business world. He has possibly written onebook or is now writing one. He may have received an honorary degree, if not,anticipates one soon.21. [ch08.html#ch8en21a] ‘Who’s in the Army Now?’ Fortune, September 1935, p.39.22.

In only one important country-Russia—is there a career diplomat,Charles E. Bohlen—and his appointment was very nearly not confirmed by theSenate. Like most of the career men in the Foreign Service, Bohlen came from anupper-class family—his father being a ‘well-known sportsman’; Bohlen waseducated at St. Paul’s School and was a member of the Porcellian Club atHarvard.

By 1954, The Strategic AirCommand alone represented ‘a direct fixed capital investment of upwards of $8.5billion. This covers mainly the cost of its aircraft and bases. The largest U.S.industrial corporation in point of assets is Standard Oil of New Jersey, withits approximately $5.4 billion. And SAC’s 175,000 “employees” are not too farfrom Jersey Standard’s 119,000 in employee-assets ratio. Like oilmen, SAC menoperate a lot of expensive equipment. (The extreme case is the B-47 crew ofthree taking up more than $2 million worth.) The assets comparison cannot bepressed very far, however, for the $8.5 billion figure is only a part of SAC’strue cost, a complete accounting of which would include a pro rata share of theequipment and installations of other commands (United States Air Forces inEurope, Military Air Transport, Air Material Command, Research and Development,and others) contributory to SAC’s operation.

For an earlier release of materials from this study, which didnot include the Eisenhower administration, see C. Wright and Ruth Mills, ‘WhatHelps Most in Politics,’ Pageant, November 1952. Cf. also H. Dewey Anderson,‘The Educational and Occupational Attainments of our National Rulers,’Scientific Monthly, vol. xxxx, pp. 511 ff; and Richard B. Fisher, The AmericanExecutive (Hoover Institute and Library on War, Revolution and Peace; StanfordUniversity Press)If we would understand the higher politician, we must collect information aboutnot one or two, or even fifty, but about the several hundred statesmen who haveoccupied the highest political offices, and in that simple sense, are thepolitical elite. The statistics presented in this note concern the 513 men whobetween 1789 and June 1953 occupied the following positions: President,Vice-President, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Cabinet Member, andSupreme Court Justice. To call any selection of men ‘the statesmen’ or ‘thepolitical elite’ is to invite disagreement about their selection. In thisselection, I have tried to include only the very pinnacles of the Americangovernment. The major ommission involves the legislators: even to include thecommittee chairmen of the House and Senate over such a long period was beyond mymeans of research. Yet such men are the prototypes of ‘the politician.’ In thissection, however, I am not interested in the American politician at large, butin those who have been at the formal head of the government. Whether they areparty politicians or not is one thing I am trying to find out. It is quite truethat at times leading members of the Senate, and even governors of key states,have exercised national political power without ever having served in one of thetop governmental positions studied here. But many senators and governors arecaught in the net which I have thrown: of the 513 men, 94 have been governorsand 143 have been United States Senators. I do not contend, of course, thatthose who occupied these positions and who later occupied one of the positionsfrom which I have selected the 513 statesmen were the most powerful andimportant senators and governors. ‘Party politicians’ as such are discussed inELEVEN: The Theory of Balance.Six out of ten of the 500-odd men who have come to the top of the governmentduring the course of United States history have come from quite prosperousfamily circumstances, being comfortable boys whose fathers were usually theprosperous and often the wealthy men of local society. Their families—which wereamong the upper 5 or 6 per cent of the American population—could well afford togive them distinct advantages in the selection and pursuit of their careers: 28per cent are from the distinctly upper class of landed wealth, big merchants,industrialists, financiers of nation-wide prominence, or professional familiesof great wealth and national standing; 30 per cent are from the prosperousupper-middle class of businessmen, farmers, and professionals, who, although notof national stature, nevertheless were quite successful and prominent in theirrespective localities.Two or three out of ten (24 per cent) have come from that middle class which isneither rich nor poor; their fathers were generally respected businessmen orfarmers, or were in the professions of law and medicine—or were dead at the timethe future statesmen left school, leaving their otherwise prosperous families inless comfortable, but manageable, circumstances.The final two out of ten (18 per cent) originate in lower-class families—13 percent from small-business or small-farming families that did not do so well, butcould readily hold their heads above dire poverty; and 5 per cent from the classof wage workers or destitute small businessmen and farmers.Occupationally, in each and every generation, the statesmen have come frombusiness and professional families in much greater proportions than theproportions of such families in the population at large. Professional men in theoccupied population have never exceeded 7 per cent, and over the years haveaveraged about 2 per cent; but 44 per cent of this political elite have comefrom such fathers’ homes. Businessmen have never exceeded 10 per cent of thetotal American labor force, but 25 per cent of the political elite have beensons of businessmen. Farmers have never dropped below 18 per cent and haveaveraged over 50 per cent of the working force, but only 27 per cent of thepolitical elite come from farmsteads. Moreover, the ‘farmers’ whose sons haveentered the political elite have been much more often prosperous than not.It has seldom been a disadvantage for a man bent on entering politics to have afather who is the governor of the state or a senator in Washington. Even anuncle or a father-in-law in such positions can be very helpful. At least 25 percent of these higher politicians have had fathers who were in some kind ofpolitical office about the time the sons left school, and when the politicalconnections of all relatives are considered, we find that at least 30 per centof the statesmen are known to have had such political connections at the timethey were setting out on their careers. In this there is some decrease: beforethe end of the Civil War, about four out of ten, after the Civil War, aboutthree out of ten, had political connections among relatives.There have been, of course, political dynasties in American politics. Yet, itcan safely be said that throughout United States history well over half of thehigher politicians have come from families not previously connected withpolitical affairs. They come more frequently from families highly placed interms of social and economic position than political influence.Since so many of the higher politicians come from families with distinctadvantages to offer, it is not surprising that no less than 67 per cent of themhave graduated from college. Even today—the historical peak of Americaneducation—only 6 or 7 per cent of all the people in the United States old enoughto have gone, have, in fact, gone to college. But in the first quarter of thenineteenth century, when very few people indeed were college-educated, 54 percent of the men then holding high political positions had graduated fromcollege. Generally, each generation of the higher politicians has includedlarger proportions of college graduates, thus paralleling, on a much higherlevel, the educational history of Americans at large.Moreover, the colleges they attended have more often been of the Ivy League thanis the case for the ordinary college graduate. Harvard and Princeton lead withabout 8 per cent each of all the higher politicians among their alumni; Yale isthird with about 6 per cent. Slightly over one-quarter attended Ivy Leagueschools, and well over one-third of those who went to any college went to IvyLeague schools. If one includes such famous schools as Dartmouth and Amherst,then one-third of all the higher politicians, and 44 per cent of those who everspent any time in college, went to top-notch eastern schools.Over half of these men grew up on the Atlantic seaboard, and were educated inthe East. That the proportion is so large in spite of the western expansion islargely a reflection of the national hold the densely populated Middle Atlanticstates of New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey have held in the origins of toppoliticians. Despite the immigration to the United States of 40 millionforeign-born between 1820 and 1953, only 4 per cent of the American statesmenhave been foreign-born. Only 2 per cent of them grew up outside the UnitedStates—and most of this handful are of The Founding Fathers’ generation.The higher politicians in America have not only been politicians; in fact, onlyfive of these 513 followed no careeer other than politics before entering theirtop positions. During the entire history of the United States, aboutthree-fourths of them have been lawyers; almost one-fourth have beenbusinessmen; a handful—some 4 per cent—have followed other careers. Theindustrialization of the American economy is directly reflected in the fact thatover three times as many were businessmen immediately after the Civil War asjust before it. Since then that fact has remained more or less constant: nearlyone-third of the higher politicians since World War I have been businessmen;over 40 per cent of the most recent men, those of the Eisenhower administration,have been.4.

The exception to this rule, of course, is now theState Department. Furthermore, promotion under civil service is supposed toproceed according to merit which is measured by progress reports. ‘This systemfails, however, to exclude personal favor inasmuch as a superior officer isstill the judge.’ Finer, op. cit. p. 521.10.

The Senator’spersonal report listed expenses of $37,224, while the Wayne County Committee forhis campaign spent $36,224.’ In all their campaigns of 1952, New York StateRepublicans reported that they had spent $227,290 with the Batten, Barton,Dustine and Osborne advertising agency and an additional $20,844 with otheragencies. (Loc. cit.)20. [ch11.html#ch11en20a] Fifty years ago, the Senator, even though he might bethe ‘representative from the railroads,’ was a virtual patriarch in comparisonwith the Representative; for he was responsible to interests powerful enough toinfluence decisively the state legislature which elected him. But, since 1913,the directly-elected Senator has also had to maneuver among the multiplicity ofinterests which so often fragment the attention and compromise the policy of theRepresentative.On the parochialism of the professional politician, in general, see theexcellent book by James MacGregor Burns, Congress on Trial: The LegislativeProcess and the Administrative State (New York: Harper, 1949), pp. 8,14, 59,142,143.21.

In thus acknowledging the social superiority of the older class, newupper-class women stress those of its themes which are available to them also.But such women form today the most reliable cash-in area for the status claimsof the old upper classes in the small towns.

In one typical small city, the heroes of the newupper class were described to me as ‘Boys with a lot of dynamite … They’re inthere together going places and doing everything that’s good for [the city].They operate nationally, see, and that’s very important in their outlook.They’re not very active in strictly local affairs, but they are active men. Theyhave active investments all over, not money just lying around doing nothing.’Stories of old families that have fallen and of active new families that haverisen illustrate to the new upper class the ‘workings of democracy’ and thepossibility of ‘anybody with the energy and brains’ getting ahead. Such storiesserve to justify their own position and style, and enable them to draw upon thenational flow of official myths concerning the inevitable success of those whoknow how to work smartly. The old upper classes do not tell such stories, atleast not to strangers, for among them prestige is a positive thing in itself,somehow inherent in their way of life, and indeed, their very being. But to thenew upper-class man, prestige seems something that he himself does not trulypossess, but could very well use in his business and social advancement; hetends to see the social position of the old upper class as an instrument for the‘selling’ of a project or the making of more money. ‘You can’t get anything donein this town without them [the old upper class]. The handles on those names arevery important … Look, if you and I go out on a project in this town, or anyother town we’ve got to have names with handles. Investors, proprietors, and soon, they just hold back until we do that. Otherwise if we had the finest projectin the world, it would be born dead.’"},{"pageContent":"* [ch03.html#pg52fn1] But not only the fast-moving mechanics of class upset theshow. Almost anything fast moving does. For the conventions of a style of lifeare important to the prestige of local society, and only where class and statusrelations are stable can conventions be stabilized. If conventions are trulyrigid, then dress becomes ‘costume,’ and conventions become ‘traditions.’ Highprestige of ancestors, of old age, of old wealth, of antiques, of ‘seniority’ ofresidence, and membership and of old ways of doing anything and everything—theygo together and together make up the status conventions of a fixed circle in astable society.When social change is swift, prestige tends to go to the young and thebeautiful, even if they are the damned; to the merely different and to the‘novel,’ even if they are the vulgar. Costumes then become ‘old-fashioned,’ andwhat matters, above all, is to be ‘fashionable.’ The appearance value of one’shouse, and even of one’s manners and one’s self, become subject to fashion.There is, in short, an appreciation of the new for its own sake: that which isnew is prestigeful. In such a situation, money more easily decides who can keepup with such a dynamic and steeply graded pattern of consumption differences indresses, cars, houses, sports, hobbies, clubs. It is, of course, to such asituation as this, and not to a stabilized leisure class, that Veblen directedhis phrases: ‘ostentatious consumption’ and ‘conspicuous waste.’ For America,and for the second generation of the period of which he wrote, he was generallycorrect."},{"pageContent":"* [ch03.html#pg58fn1] A word about Thorstein Veblen’s The Theory of the LeisureClass (1899) which—fortunately—is still read, not because his criticism of theAmerican upper class is still adequate, but because his style makes itplausible, even when the criticism is not taken seriously. What he wrote remainsstrong with the truth, even though his facts do not cover the scenes and thecharacters that have emerged in our own time. It remains strong because we couldnot see the newer features of our own time had he not written what and as hedid. Which is one meaning of the fact that his biases are the most fruitful thathave appeared in the literature of American social protest. But all critics aremortal; and Veblen’s theory is in general no longer an adequate account of theAmerican system of prestige.The Theory of the Leisure Class, is not the theory of the leisure class. It is atheory of a particular element of the upper classes in one period of the historyof one nation. It is an account of the status struggle between new and oldwealth and, in particular, it is an examination of the nouveau riche, so much inevidence in Veblen’s formative time, the America of the latter half of thenineteenth century, of the Vanderbilts, Goulds, and Harrimans, of SaratogaSprings and Newport, of the glitter and the gold.It is an analysis of an upper class which is climbing socially by translatingits money into symbols of status, but doing so in a status situation in whichthe symbols are ambiguous. Moreover, the audience for the Veblenian drama is nottraditional, nor the actors firmly set in an inherited social structure, as infeudalism. Accordingly, consumption patterns are the only means of competing forstatus honor. Veblen does not analyze societies with an old nobility or a courtsociety where the courtier was a successful style of life.In depicting the higher style of American life, Veblen—like the actors of whomhe writes—seems to confuse aristocratic and bourgeois traits. At one or twopoints, he does so explicitly: ‘The aristocratic and the bourgeois virtues—thatis to say the destructive and pecuniary traits-should be found chiefly among theupper classes …,’18 [ch15_notes.html#ch3en18] One has only to examine the tasteof the small businessmen to know that this is certainly not true.‘Conspicuous consumption,’ as Veblen knew, is not confined to the upper classes.But today I should say that it prevails especially among one element of the newupper classes—the nouveau riche of the new corporate privileges—the men onexpense accounts, and those enjoying other corporate prerogatives—and with evenmore grievous effects on the standard and style of life of the professionalcelebrities of stage and screen, radio and TV. And, of course, among recentcrops of more old-fashioned nouveau riche dramatized by the ‘Texasmillionaires.’In the middle of the twentieth century, as at the end of the nineteenth whichVeblen observed, there are fantastic goings-on: ‘Tenor Mario Lanza now owns anoutsize, custom-built white Cadillac with a gold-plated dashboard … RestaurateurMike Romanoff ships his silk and pongee shirts air express to Sulka’s inManhattan for proper laundering … Construction Tycoon Hal Hayes … has a built-inbar in his Cadillac plus faucets for Scotch, bourbon, champagne and beer in hishome….’19 [ch15_notes.html#ch3en19] But in established local society, the menand women of the fourth and fifth generation are quietly expensive andexpensively quiet; they are, in fact, often deliberately inconspicuous in theirconsumption: with unpretentious farm houses and summer retreats, they often livequite simply, and certainly without any ostentatious display of vulgar opulence.The terms of Veblen’s theory are not adequate to describe the established upperclasses of today. Moreover—as we shall see in FOUR,Veblen’s work, as a theory ofthe American status system, does not take into adequate account the rise of theinstituted elite or of the world of the celebrity. He could not, of course, havebeen expected in the eighteen-nineties to see the meaning for a truly nationalstatus system of ‘the professional celebrities,’ who have arisen as part of thenational media of mass communication and entertainment, or anticipate thedevelopment of national glamour, whereby the debutante is replaced by the moviestar, and the local society lady by the military and political and economicmanagers—’the power elite’—whom many now celebrate as their proper chieftains."},{"pageContent":"* [ch03.html#pg61fn1] Even in 1933, some fifty New Yorkers maintained theirfull-rate dues in Boston’s Somerset Club.20 [ch15_notes.html#ch3en20]"},{"pageContent":"* [ch03.html#pg63fn1] ‘The daughter of the industrial leader, of the greatprofessional man must thrive in a complex civilization which places littlepremium upon its women’s homelier virtues: meekness and modesty, earnestness andGodliness.

Whether the public servant receives officeor not is accidental, and if this public servant by accident does assume office,as likely as not it is apt to reduce a great deal of the public servant’s publicservice.”’28 [ch15_notes.html#ch4en28]Mr. Young stated in his own economic metaphysics in 1931: ‘A certain amount ofhorseplay seems to be required as stage effect for the functioning of democraticgovernment.

Our sole interest is in therichest at each of these periods, regardless of how rich that may be comparedwith the rich of other periods, or compared with the income and property of thepopulation at large. The wealth of each generation, accordingly, is presentedhere in the dollar value of the time each generation reached the mature age ofabout 60.Because of the unknown factor of inflation, it is necessary to use extremecaution in interpreting such facts as the following: of the 1950 generation,including billionaire Hunt, some six people are estimated to own more than $300million, compared with no more than three such people in 1900 or 1925. Fartherdown the pyramid from these exalted levels, the distribution according to sizeof fortune is rather similar in each of the three generations. Roughly, about 20per cent of each group are in the 100 million or more bracket; the remainingbeing rather equally divided between the $50–99 million and the $30–49 millionlevels."},{"pageContent":"* [ch05.html#pg108fn1] The supposed shamefulness of labor, on which many ofVeblen’s conceptions of the upper classes rest, does not square very well withthe Puritan work ethic so characteristic of much of American life, includingmany upper-class elements. I suppose that in his book on the leisure class,Veblen is speaking only of upper, not middle, classes—certainly he is notwriting of wealthy Puritan middle classes. He did not want to call what thehigher businessman does ‘work,’ much less productive work. The very term,leisure class, became for him synonymous with upper class, but there has beenand there is a working upper class—in fact, a class of prodigiously active men.That Veblen did not approve of their work, and in fact refused to give it thatterm—work being one of his positive words—is irrelevant. Moreover, in this caseit obscures and distorts our understanding of the upper classes as a socialformation. Yet for Veblen fully to have admitted this simple fact would havedestroyed (or forced the much greater sophistication of) his whole perspectiveand indeed one of the chief moral bases of his criticism.From one rather formal viewpoint, it should be noted that Veblen was aprofoundly conservative critic of America: he wholeheartedly accepted one of thefew unambiguous, all-American values: the value of efficiency, of utility, ofpragmatic simplicity. His criticism of institutions and the personnel ofAmerican society was based without exception on his belief that they did notadequately fulfill this American value. If he was, as I believe, a Socraticfigure, he was in his own way as American as Socrates in his was Athenian. As acritic, Veblen was effective precisely because he used the American value ofefficiency to criticize American reality. He merely took this value seriouslyand used it with devastatingly systematic rigor. It was a strange perspectivefor an American critic in the nineteenth century, or in our own. One looked downfrom Mont St. Michel, like Henry Adams, or across from England, like HenryJames. With Veblen perhaps the whole character of American social criticismshifted. The figure of the last-generation American faded and the figure of thefirst-generation American—the Norwegian immigrant’s son, the New York Jewteaching English literature in a midwestern university, the southerner comenorth to crash New York—was installed as the genuine, if no longer100-per-cent-American, critic."},{"pageContent":"* [ch05.html#pg111fn1] If you started at 20 years of age and worked until youwere 50 or so, saving $200,000 a year, you would still have, at a rate of 5 percent compound interest, only $14 million, less than half of the lower limits wehave taken for the great American fortunes.But if you had bought only $9,900 worth of General Motors stock in 1913, and,rather than use your judgment, had gone into a coma—allowing the proceeds topile up in General Motors—then, in 1953, you would have about $7 million.And, if you had not even exercised the judgment of choosing General Motors, butmerely put $10,000 into each of the total of 480 stocks listed in 1913—a totalinvestment of about $1 million—and then gone into a coma until 1953, you wouldhave come out worth $10 million and have received in dividends and rightsanother $10 million.

Galbraith, nor thesearch for a restraining corporate conscience, conducted by the legal theorist,A. A. Berle, Jr., is convincing. Both are concerned to show the restraints uponthe acknowledged powers of the corporation: Galbraith finding it from without,in a new version of the equilibrium theory; Berle, from within, in an odd viewof the conscience of the powerful.I. Many exceptions must be noted to any equilibrium that may prevail among thenew giants. Some industries are integrated from the source of supply to theultimate consumer; and in some industries, such as residential construction, theindividual contractor is squeezed between strong craft unions and strongsuppliers, rather than balancing with them. Moreover, as is recognized by Mr.Galbraith himself, ‘countervailing power’ does not work in periods of inflation,for then the corporation’s resistance to wage demands is reduced, and it is easyto pass on the increased costs to the consumer, whose demands, in turn, are sostrong that the retailer is pressed to satisfy them, and thus cannot wield hispower against the corporate producer. In such times, the big units, far frombeing held in countervailance, become a ‘coalition against the public.’ The bigpower blocs gang up on the consumer, rather than benefit him by countervailingagainst one another. It also would seem that market power does not exactly‘generate’ countervailing power: with the exception of railroading, strongunions did not develop in strong industries, until government backed them up inthe ’thirties. Nor do chain stores prosper in countervailance to automobiles orpetroleum but rather in the relatively unconcentrated field of food suppliers.The new equilibrium, in short, is not self-regulating. To know that power doesnot automatically ‘beget’ its countervailing power, one has only to think offarm laborers and white-collar employees. But the weaker unit, Mr. Galbraithurges, ought to organize an opposition; then perhaps it will be able to get theaid of government, and government should support the weaker side of anyimbalance. Thus weakness, as well as strength, is to lead to countervailingpower, and the theory of the big equilibrium becomes less a theory of the goingfact than a suggested guideline to public policy, a moral proposal for strategicaction. Moreover, it is assumed that the government is less an integral elementof the balance than an umpire biased toward shoring up those with weak marketpower. When the conceptions of the big balance are laid alongside thequalifications and exceptions which must be made, they do not seem so compellingas the bold initial statement of ‘countervailing power.’ Like the ‘competition’among little entrepreneurs, which it is designed to replace, ‘countervailingpower’ among the big blocs is more ideological hope than factual description,more dogma than realism.15 [ch15_notes.html#ch6en15]II. As for Mr. Berle’s search for a corporate conscience, see the remainder ofthis chapter for an account of the men who have presumably developed it. In amoney-economy, expediency may follow the longer or the shorter run. Theirinclination for longer-run profits, for a stable take, in an economy integratedwith political institutions and shored up by military purchases, requires thatcorporations become more political; and today they are, of course, as muchpolitical as economic institutions. As political institutions, they are ofcourse totalitarian and dictatorial, although externally, they display muchpublic relation and liberal rhetoric of defense.

The number of corporate rich for any given year, as well as thenumber of million-dollar incomes, is related to the tax rate and to the profitlevel of the corporate world. Periods of low taxes and high profits are periodsin which the declared million-dollar incomes flourish: in the ideal year of1929, 513 people, estates, or trusts, told the government they had receivedincomes of one million or more. The average of these million-dollar incomes was$2.36 million, and after taxes the average million-dollar man had 1.99 millionleft. In the slump year of 1932, there were still 20 people who reported incomesof one million or more; by 1939, when three-fourths of all the families in theUnited States had incomes of less than $2,000 a year, there were 45 suchmillion-dollar incomes reported. With the war, however, the number ofmillion-dollar incomes increased as did the general level of income. In 1949when both profits and taxes were high, the average income of the 120 people whotold the government they had received one million or more was 2.13 million;after taxes they were left with $910,000. In 1919, however, when taxes andprofits were high although profits were falling a bit, only 65 people earned onemillion or more, averaging 2.3 million before taxes, but only $825,000 aftertaxes.8 [ch15_notes.html#ch7en8]"},{"pageContent":"* [ch07.html#pg153fn1] For example, a man can give $10,000 worth of stock to atheological seminary, which—because of tax savings—actually costs him only$4,268.49.

Lawyers also often findthat—win or lose—politics is useful to their profession of law, since itpublicizes one’s practice. In addition, a private law practice, a business whichcan be carried in one’s briefcase, can be set up almost anywhere. Accordingly,the lawyer as politician has something to fall back upon whenever he is notre-elected as well as something to lean upon if he wishes when he is elected. Infact, for some lawyers, a political term or two is thought of, and is in fact,merely a stepping stone to a larger law practice, in Washington or back home.The practice of law often allows a man to enter politics without much risk andsome chance of advantage to a main source of money independent of theelectorate’s whims.13 [ch15_notes.html#ch11en13]Most of the members of Congress over the last fifteen years—and probably muchlonger than that—have originated from the same professional and entrepreneurialoccupations as they themselves have followed over the last decade.

Yet the often noted tendency of ‘the other side’ to regardany move by some unit of one side as having significance in terms of the whole,indicates clearly that in the views, expectations, and demands of these men,they do form, even if unwillingly, blocs. They see one another as members ofblocs, and in fact are inter-knit in various and quite intricate ways.Individual unions may lobby for particularistic interests, which is one key tosuch lack of unity as labor as a bracket displays. But increasingly the issuesthey face, and the contexts in which they must face them, are national in scopeand effect, and so they must co-ordinate labor’s line with reference to anational context, on pain of loss of power.The corporate executive, like the labor leader, is a practical man and anopportunist, but for him enduring means, developed for other purposes, areavailable for the conduct of his political as well as, of his business-laboraffairs. The corporation is now a very stable basis of operation; in fact, it ismore stable and more important for the continuance of the American arrangementthan the lifetime family. The business member of the power elite can rely uponthe corporation in the pursuit of his short-term goals and opportunisticmaneuvering. But the union is often in a state of protest; it is on thedefensive in a sometimes actually and always potentially hostile society. Itdoes not provide such enduring means as are ready-made and at the businesselite’s disposal. If he wants such means, even for his little goals, the laborleader must himself build and maintain them. Moreover, the great organizingupsurge of the ’thirties showed that officers who were not sufficientlyresponsive to the demands of industrial workers could lose power. Thecorporation manager on the other hand, in the context of his corporation, is notan elected official in the same sense. His power does not depend upon theloyalty of the men who work for him and he does not usually lose his job if aunion successfully invades his plants. The upsurges of the ’thirties did notoust the managers; their responsibilities are not to the workers whom theyemploy, but to themselves and their scattered stockholders.This difference in power situation means that the power of the business leaderis likely to be more continuous and more assured than that of the labor leader:the labor leader is more likely to be insecure in his job if he fails to‘deliver the goods.’However it may be with the corporate and the political elite, there is nothing,it seems to me, in the makeup of the current labor leaders as individuals and asa group to lead us to believe that they can or will transcend the strategy ofmaximum adaptation. By this I mean that they react more than they lead, and thatthey do so to retain and to expand their position in the constellation of powerand advantage. Certain things could happen that would cause the downfall of thepresent labor leadership or sections of it, and other types of leaders mightthen rise to union power; but the current crop of labor leaders is pretty wellset up as a dependent variable in the main drift with no role in the powerelite. Neither labor leaders nor labor unions are at the present juncture likelyto be ‘independent variables,’ in the national context.41[ch15_notes.html#ch11en41]"},{"pageContent":"* [ch12.html#pg274fn1] See above, ONE: The Higher Circles."},{"pageContent":"* [ch12.html#pg277fn1] ‘Ruling class’ is a badly loaded phrase. ‘Class’ is aneconomic term; ‘rule’ a political one.

It should be clear to the reader by nowthat we do not accept as adequate the simple view that high economic menunilaterally make all decisions of national consequence. We hold that such asimple view of ‘economic determinism’ must be elaborated by ‘politicaldeterminism’ and ‘military determinism’; that the higher agents of each of thesethree domains now often have a noticeable degree of autonomy; and that only inthe often intricate ways of coalition do they make up and carry through the mostimportant decisions.

In other schools of higher learning college menhave played dishonest basketball at the moneyed requests of crooked gamblers. InNew York City, girls from quite respectable homes have been bought, for a fewhundred dollars, by holidaying corporate executives from playboys of very richfamilies in the business of procuring. In Washington, as well as in other majorcities, men in high places have accepted bribes and yielded to pull. BySeptember 1954, some 1400 cases of windfall profits, appropriated during thelater ‘forties, had been turned up: corporations that had built for or investedin the Federal Housing Administration’s rental housing got mortgages for morethan the cost of the building, pocketing the difference, which came to hundredsof millions.13 [ch15_notes.html#ch14en13] Government officials and businesscontractors, as well as party girls—three for $400—and paid-for fishing tripswere part of the operating procedure. During the late war, of course, anyonewith smart money and the right connections could have all the black-market meatand gasoline he cared for. And in one recent Presidential campaign, publicdistrust reached a shrill and cynical tone, when, in an unprecedented gesture,each of the leading candidates for the highest offices in the land felt itnecessary to make public an accounting of his personal income.In illegal enterprises, the small investment with the quick, fantastic returnflourishes. Dozens of such industries flourish in the boomtown flush of thepost-Korean crime increase. The world bankers have formed an association tofight the rise of embezzlement: ‘Put bluntly,’ reports The New York Times, ‘morepeople are stealing more money from banks.’14 [ch15_notes.html#ch14en14]Narcotics and hijacking, embezzlements and counterfeiting, tax cheating andshoplifting—all have paid off handsomely.Put bluntly, crime, if organized on a proper business-like basis, pays. Americangangsters, we now know, are the specialized personnel of nationwide businesses,having syndicated connections with one another and with local publicauthorities. But more important than the fact that illegal businesses are nowwell-organized industries is the fact that the ‘hoods’ of the ‘twenties have inthe ‘forties and ‘fifties become businessmen who own hotels and distilleries,resorts and trucking companies. Among such members of the fraternity of success,to have a police record means merely that you did not know the right people.15[ch15_notes.html#ch14en15]Organized crime in the underworld raises to an extreme the individualisticphilosophy of predatory success, the indifference to the public weal, the fetishof the profit motive and of the laissez-faire state. As an integral part ofAmerican culture, the ‘underworld … serves to meet demands for goods andservices which are defined as illegitimate, but for which there is neverthelessa strong demand from respectable people … It is implicit in our economic,political, legal and social organization … It is in this sense that we have thecriminals we deserve.’16 [ch15_notes.html#ch14en16]For the New Jersey banker, Harold G. Hoffman, crime paid. He became mayor,Congressman, Governor of his state; only upon his death in 1954 was itdiscovered that for over a decade he had gotten away with $300,000 of statefunds and in addition, in the morality play of state politics, had been deep ina network of corruption involving respected banks, insurance companies andhighly placed individuals. Army Px’s have sold ‘such unmilitary items as minkcoats and expensive jewelry’ at prices well below retail levels. Charities havebeen discovered to be rackets for private profit. Eighteen persons and sevencorporations were indicted in February 1954 on charges of defrauding thegovernment in surplus ship deals, among them Julius C. Holmes, former Ministerin the United States embassy in London and special assistant to the Secretary ofState. Czars of local labor unions have enriched themselves by extortion andshakedown, by bribery and the union welfare fund. Respected administrators ofprivate hospitals have bought aspirin in wholesale lots for $9.83, selling it topatients for $600. Major General Roderick Allen in March 1954 caused $1,200 ofarmy money to be spent on a dog house for his Siberian Huskies. Those who readbusiness manuals, in addition to newspapers, know that, by 1954, some 214internal revenue employees and friends of the middle ‘forties had been indicted,100 convicted—including the head tax-collector of the Federal government.17[ch15_notes.html#ch14en17] And all over the country, upper-middle andupper-class tax dodgers personally treat each spring as an invitation to a gameof ingenious lying and skillful deception. Revelations from the upper depthsreached some sort of climax during the spring of 1954 when the Secretary of theArmy and his assistants tangled with a Senator and his assistants: theMcCarthy-Army hearings, as we have already noted, stripped from high officialsand a number of Senators all dignity and status.

The common denominatorof the conservative mood in America today is American history. This is the timeof the American historian. All nationalist celebration tends, of course, to beput in historical terms, but the celebrators do not wish to be relevant merelyto the understanding of history as past event. Their purpose is the celebrationof the present. (1) One reason why the American ideology is so historicallyoriented is that of all the scholarly community it is the historians who aremost likely to create such public assumptions. For, of all the scholarlywriters, the historians have been the ones with the literate tradition. Other‘social scientists’ are more likely to be unacquainted with English usage andmoreover, they do not write about large topics of public concern. (2) The ‘good’historians, in fulfilling the public role of the higher journalists, thehistorians with the public attention and the Sunday acclaim, are the historianswho are the quickest to re-interpret the American past with relevance to thecurrent mood, and in turn, the cleverest at picking out of the past, just now,those characters and events that most easily make for optimism and lyricupsurge. (3) In truth, and without nostalgia, we ought to realize that theAmerican past is a wonderful source for myths about the American present. Thatpast, at times, did indeed embody quite a way of life; the United States hasbeen extraordinarily fortunate in its time of origin and early development; thepresent is complicated, and, especially to a trained historian, quiteundocumented. The general American ideology accordingly tends to be of historyand by historians.4 [ch15_notes.html#ch15en14]"}]
