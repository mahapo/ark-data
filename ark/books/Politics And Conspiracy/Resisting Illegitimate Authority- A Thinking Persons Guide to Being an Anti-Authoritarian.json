We ain’t got no badges! We don’t need nobadges! I don’t have to show you any stinkin’ badges!”—John Huston’s 1948 filmThe Treasure of the Sierra MadreWhen I was a teenager, my friends and I enjoyed repeating Gold Hat’s line. Itdid not matter that Gold Hat was a “bad guy” attempting to steal from the “goodguys.” While school had taught us compliance with all those possessing badges ofauthority and to slavishly work to acquire such badges, Gold Hat’s view wasliberating.Authoritarian is routinely defined as “relating to, or favoring blind submissionto authority.” In contrast, anti-authoritarians reject—for themselves and forothers—an unquestioning obedience to authority, and they believe in challengingand resisting illegitimate authority.Anti-authoritarians are a threat to authoritarians who demand unquestioningobedience. Thus, authoritarians attempt to marginalize anti-authoritarians.Anti-authoritarians in the United States have been scorned, shunned, financiallypunished, psychopathologized, criminalized, and assassinated. While U.S. societynow honors a few deceased anti-authoritarians, these same figures were oftenmarginalized, silenced, and dishonored in their own lifetime. Today,anti-authoritarians continue to be under great pressure to comply with thestatus quo, making their survival difficult.All noncompliance creates tension, but not all noncompliant people areanti-authoritarians. I will distinguish anti-­authoritarians as distinct fromother noncompliant individuals—and explain why Gold Hat is noanti-authoritarian.While all anti-authoritarians do not identify with a political philosophy, allanti-authoritarians do represent a political threat to their authoritariansurroundings, be that a government, school, or family. Anti-authoritarianscreate tension not simply for authoritarians with power but also forauthoritarian followers, who fear that the absence of a strong authority willresult in chaos. In contrast, anti-authoritarians believe that what is mostdangerous and harmful is an illegitimate authority, and they reso­nate withscientist and novelist C. P. Snow’s observation: “When you think of the long andgloomy history of man, you will find more hideous crimes have been committed inthe name of obedience than have ever been committed in the name of rebellion.”Resisting Illegitimate Authority is about bigotry but not about bigotry directedat race, religion, gender, or sexual preference—all of which certainly remainsin the United States today. This book is about another kind of bigotry, onedirected at certain personalities and temperaments—a bigotry that often goesunnoticed.One temperament that U.S. society has grown less tolerant of is introversion.Susan Cain’s bestselling book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World thatCan’t Stop Talking (2012) argues that we undervalue introverts in our culture,doing them and society a disservice. When asked why she wrote the book, Cainanswered: “For the same reason that Betty Friedan published The FeminineMystique in 1963. Introverts are to extroverts what women were to men at thattime—second-class citizens with gigantic amounts of untapped talent. Ourschools, workplaces, and religious institutions are designed for extroverts, andmany introverts believe that there is something wrong with them and that theyshould try to ‘pass’ as extroverts.”There is even more intolerance for anti-authoritarians—a highly diverse groupwhose members include people from all genders, races, ethnicities, sexualpreferences, and personalities. In 2012, I wrote an article “WhyAnti-Authoritarians Are Diagnosed as Mentally Ill” (titled on some websites as“Would We Have Drugged Up Einstein?”), and I continue to receive emails frompeople feeling validated by it, stating that they believe theiranti-authoritarianism—or their child’s—has resulted in mental illness diagnoses.In the 1950s and 1960s, the horrors inflicted by Nazi Germany were still on theminds of many Americans, and the 1950 book The Authoritarian Personality, whichpsychopathologized authoritarian personalities, became popular. In the early1960s, psychologist Stanley Milgram’s studies revealed a frightening obedienceamong Americans to illegitimate authority, and this became a cause for concern.I will detail these and other examinations of authoritarianism andanti-authoritarianism, as well as controversies surrounding the “authoritarianpersonality” and the “anti-authoritarian personality.”By the 1980s, U.S. society had changed. In 1980, Americans elected former actorRonald Reagan to the presidency. Reagan had previously acquired an authoritarianstrongman reputation by putting down student revolts as governor of California.By the mid-1980s, the Democrats, wanting to appear as tough as the Republicans,strongly supported “anti-crime” legislation that has contributed to the UnitedStates having the highest incarceration rate in the world, caused in large partby hypocritical drug laws.In my mental health profession during the 1980s, it was noncompliance ratherthan compliance that became increasingly pathologized. The American PsychiatricAssociation (APA), politically in step with U.S. society, revised its diagnosticmanual, the DSM-III (1980), to include “oppositional defiant disorder” (ODD) fornoncompliant kids who do not engage in criminal behaviors. The APA classifiesODD as one kind of “disruptive behavior disorder.” Disruptive behavior disordersare now the most common classification of children medicated withantipsychotics, among the highest grossing classes of drugs in the United Statestoday. The U.S. antipsychotic drug explosion is largely the result of their useon non-psychotic vulnerable populations—especially foster children, the elderlyin nursing homes, and inmates in prisons and jails—as a relatively inexpensiveway to subdue and manage these groups.Between 1978 and 1985, I was in graduate school and in training to become aclinical psychologist, and my embarrassment with the mental health professionincreased throughout my schooling and internships. I struggled as to whether Ishould quit or continue so as to get my PhD “badge.” Ironically, this “stinkin’badge,” which lacks legitimate authority for me, has provided me withcredibility for the mainstream media that for the most part bases its assessmentof authorities solely on their badges.There are certainly societies less free and more oppressive than the UnitedStates. However, what makes life difficult for U.S. anti-authoritarians is thatAmericans are indoctrinated to believe that their society celebratesanti-authoritarianism. And so they are less prepared for the reality ofanti-authoritarian life than others who have not been so indoctrinated.Anti-authoritarians exist in all walks of life and come in all kinds oftemperaments—some extroverted, some introverted, some funny, some serious, andso on. To illustrate this diversity, I will profile several famousanti-authoritarians with a lens focused at illuminating their essentialanti-authoritarianism and an emphasis on what can be gleaned from their lives.Obviously, I cannot include every famous anti-authoritarian public figure. Iwill instead talk about those who I have been drawn to because their lives haveprovided me with lessons about anti-authoritarian survival, tragedy, andtriumph.Readers will sense that I have affection for many of these famousanti-authoritarians who I profile, and that I am sympathetic to all of them,even the ones who have hurt themselves, others, and the cause of creating a morejust and free society. Sometimes luck is the only difference betweenanti-­authoritarians having a constructive or destructive life.Resisting Illegitimate Authority is about valuing anti-­authoritarians. My lifework has been “depathologizing” noncompliance and rebellion; helpinganti-authoritarians survive within authoritarian schools, workplaces, and otherenvironments; assisting those who love anti-authoritarians to better understandthem; and helping anti-authoritarians gain hope that while a wise struggleagainst illegitimate authorities may or may not be victorious, it can lead to acommunity of fellow anti-authoritarians.Earlier in Stanley Milgram’s life, he was personally affected by the Holocaustand Nazi atrocities, as family members who had survived concentration campsstayed temporarily in his home when he was a child. So when his research onAmericans revealed an unexpectedly high rate of obedience to authoritycommanding subjects to commit cruel actions, this very much troubled Milgram.Moreover, prior to his publishing Obedience to Authority (1974), Milgram wasshaken by the My Lai massacre and other U.S. atrocities that were committed byAmerican soldiers in the Vietnam War.Milgram wrote: “The results as seen and felt in the laboratory, are to thisauthor disturbing. They raise the possibility that human nature or—morespecifically—the kind of character produced in American democratic society,cannot be counted on to insulate its citizens from brutality and inhumanetreatment at the direction of malevolent authority.” For Milgram, “the capacityfor man to abandon his humanity” so as to comply with authority is what hecalled humanity’s “fatal flaw,” which he concluded, “in the long run gives ourspecies only a modest chance of survival.”A small ray of hope is that within the human family there areanti-authoritarians—people comfortable questioning the ­legitimacy of authorityand challenging and resisting where it is seen to be illegitimate."},{"pageContent":"PART ONE: AUTHORITARIANS AND ANTI-AUTHORITARIANS"},{"pageContent":"1: AUTHORITIES—AND MY PATH TO RESISTING ILLEGITIMATE AUTHORITYWhen I was six years old, I had appendicitis. The pediatrician said that I had astomachache that would go away. He was wrong. I ended up in the hospital for twoweeks due to a ruptured appendix. I remember my family being very angry withthis doctor for his misdiagnosis.Soon after that, like many other children and teenagers, I can recall evaluatingwhether an authority was a legitimate one to be taken seriously or anillegitimate one to be resisted, and I have never stopped this evaluationprocess.One way young children test the legitimacy of adult authorities is by being asmart ass—or disruptive in some manner—to see how the adult reacts. Will theadult reciprocally behave like another kid? Or will the adult behave like anadult should behave, which is not to use their power to take revenge? Icertainly tested that out.Entering third grade, from the first day of class, I carefully observed myteacher, Mrs. Rike. When one of my classmates would talk without her permission,she would command: “Write one hundred times, I will not talk.” Or if herdirections were not followed, she would order: “Write one hundred times, I willfollow directions.” A couple of months into the school year, I hatched a planfor her, one that involved writing.The evening before my big day in Mrs. Rike’s classroom, I had privately written“I will not talk” one hundred times, and then did it again, so I had two suchlists, both which I brought to school the next day. I could hardly wait for myopportunity. That morning in class, I began talking without permission. Mrs.Rike told me to be quiet, but I kept right on talking, and she appearedflabbergasted. While I had often forgotten to raise my hand to get permission tospeak, I never had actually blatantly disobeyed her.Mrs. Rike ordered me to write one hundred times I will not talk. This I hadpredicted, and I immediately pulled out my first prepared list from my desk andhanded it to her. My classmates laughed, and I was delighted. Mrs. Rikeresponded, “You think you are so smart, Bruce. Well, I will have anotherone-hundred I will not talks.” Exactly as I also predicted, and I pulled out mysecond list and handed it to her. My classmates howled. Would she stop there orask for a third such list which I had not ­prepared? With a look of disgust onher face, Mrs. Rike threw up her hands and moved on. My victory gave me anempowering buzz, the kind of buzz that one gets from outsmarting an authorityfigure.In addition to testing Mrs. Rike’s legitimacy as an authority, I was alsomotivated by a desire to be seen as clever by my classmates. Being viewed asclever, I later discovered, was one of George Orwell’s motivations for writing.In his essay “Why I Write,” he candidly explained that sheer egoism and the“desire to seem clever, to be talked about” is one of his “four great motivesfor writing.” Orwell’s other three writing motives were: aesthetic enthusiasm,including the pleasure of words and their right arrangement; historical impulsefor truth and to see things as they actually are; and political purposes,including a desire to push the world in a certain direction. At eight-years-old,I did not yet possess these other three motives, but my future writing effortswere encouraged by getting recognition for cleverness from my classmates.That empowering triumph of outsmarting a teacher was in 1964. Today in manyschools, a third-grade teacher, rather than retreating, can call for apara—short for outreach paraprofessionals—who can escort a misbehaving kid outof the classroom for counseling. These outreach paraprofessionals are supervisedby an outreach counselor, who can bail out a teacher who has been overmatched bya kid.Mrs. Rike did not hold a grudge, and so she maintained her authority for me. Hadshe taken revenge—which for myself and many other eight-year-olds would havemeant telling my parents that I needed to be taken to the psychologist for anevaluation—she would have lost my respect and lost her authority for me.What would have happened to me if today’s rules were in place in 1964? Perhapsauthorities would have looked up my records and discovered what my second-gradeteacher had written about my Social Behavior: “On a number of occasions lately,Bruce had to be reminded about proper behavior in school and his lack ofself-control. Bruce tends to speak out in class without first waiting to becalled upon.” This report in today’s world may well have been enough for theschool to pressure my parents to have me evaluated by a psychologist. Would Ihave been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)? Would I have been medicated?I feel lucky. Lucky about not being diagnosed and labeled. Lucky about not beingbehavior modified or medicated. And lucky about not being deprived of that greatfeeling of successfully outsmarting a teacher. And I feel sad that many kidstoday are not so lucky.I grew up in the New York City neighborhood of Arverne in Rockaway, Queens. Itwas composed of racially and ethnically mixed working-class and poor people. Myfriends and I grew up in blue-collar families. My father worked in the postoffice, and my mother was a part-time “colorist” (coloring in black-and-whitephoto portraits) and later a part-time bookkeeper. Among my group of friends,none of our parents had gone to college, and since we were all doing well enoughin school to go to college, that’s pretty much all our parents cared about. Andso, outside of school, we were pretty much free to do whatever we wanted to do.The authorities that most dominated our everyday life were teachers, and ourexperience of them was not much different than what most teenagers tell metoday—that almost all their teachers are excruciatingly boring, and in theunusual cases that their teachers are interesting and fun, they seem to getfired.As a kid, sports was my greatest passion, and I was keenly aware of legitimateand illegitimate authorities even in this realm. For example, it was clear to methat some sportswriters were honest with fans about what was wrong with ahometown team, and others were shills and flunkies who cared more about gainingapproval from team management than being honest with fans. And so by the time Ibecame a teenager, it was clear to me that the world was divided between peoplewilling to risk security in order to challenge and resist authority versuspeople who sucked up to all authorities so they could get ahead.I’ve always loved movies and history, and looking back at my youth, I can seethat I was drawn to historical movies from all eras with anti-authoritarianthemes—from Spartacus to Serpico. As a young kid, I recall getting excited byone particular scene in Inherit the Wind, the fictional account of the Scopesmonkey trial. In that scene, Spencer Tracy playing Henry Drummond (whosecharacter is based on Clarence Darrow) cross examines Fredric March playingMatthew Brady (based on William ­Jennings Bryan). Challenging his literalinterpretation of the Bible, Drummond asks Brady about where Cain found hiswife, “If, in the beginning, there were just Cain and Abel, and Adam and Eve,where did this extra woman come from? Did you ever stop to think about that?”And when Brady tries to sidestep the question, Drummond mocks him, “You figuresomebody else pulled another creation over in the next county somewhere?” It wasexhilarating to see an anti-authoritarian challenge an authoritarian, anddeliver a comical intellectual knockout. But it was troubling to see how thisintellectual triumph meant nothing in terms of the trial outcome. Drummond, ashad Darrow, lost the case.I grew up during the Vietnam War era when it was common for many Americans toquestion and challenge their leaders—and even resist them. Lyndon Baines Johnsonhad won election for president in 1964, and not long after, I remember manyyoung people chanting, “Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?” Irecall watching Johnson on television, always trying to convince everybody thatwe were winning the war. No one I knew believed him.Then in 1968, Richard Nixon was elected president. Nixon seemed to be such anobvious liar that I had a sinking feeling about the adult world: Were they blindto the obvious, or were they resigned to their leaders being nothing butself-serving politicians? Later when I found out that Nixon had sabotaged the1968 peace talks so that he could win the election, then lied to Johnson abouthis treason, and also that Johnson had evidence to prove Nixon was lying to himbut covered it up for his own selfish reasons, I began to understand that ashorrible as I had already thought these politicians to be, they were in facteven worse.As a young kid, I remember that almost all the guys who were a few years olderthan me were frightened about getting drafted into the military. Toward the endof 1969, the draft lottery began, and I began to worry about what my lotterynumber would be when I became eligible. I distinctly recall my adolescent yearsfilled with the fear that I was going to get maimed or killed in Vietnam unlessI ran away to Canada and became a fugitive.So by the time I was a teenager, I had discovered the hell that can be createdby authorities who are either liars or who don’t know what they’re talking aboutbut have spent a lifetime perfecting how to appear like they do. The capacity ofRobert McNamara (secretary of defense under John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson) andlater Henry Kissinger (Richard Nixon’s National Security Advisor and secretaryof state) to convey confidence about the rightness of America’s Vietnam policiesis a major reason for the tragic deaths of more than 58,000 Americans and threeto four million Vietnamese. McNamara was a Harvard Business School alumni, andKissinger received several advanced degrees at Harvard and became a Harvardfaculty member and director of the Harvard Defense Studies Program. I learnedearly in life not to trust prestigious college degree/badges of authority.By 1974, Nixon was forced to resign, not for his real crimes against humanitybut for his cover-up crimes in the Watergate scandal. I remember having analmost sadistic pleasure watching the Congressional Judiciary Committee’simpeachment hearings on television, and being disappointed that Nixon quitbefore he was humiliated by an impeachment.Every summer of my high school and college years, I had jobs. I have a pleasantmemory of only one boss, Spatz, who was my boss one summer working for the NewYork City Parks Department. In the workplace hierarchy, Spatz was below the muchfeared general foreman, Charlie “Bags” (short for a last name that I have longforgotten). Charlie Bags would make surprise inspections, seeming to always showup when we were relaxing, and then ruining our day with threats. But Spatz wouldyell at Charlie Bags and defend us, “The park is clean, so get the fuck out ofhere.” Then Spatz yelled at him in Italian, and Charlie Bags, who was also anItalian American, would get angry but leave. I hadn’t seen any other authorityassert themselves with their boss to defend their subordinates, and I foundmyself respecting Spatz.By my teens, I had become what is now called “depressed,” and I started readingpsychology and philosophy books. I also listened to a lot of pain-soothingfolk-rock music. My musical hero was the anti-authoritarian Phil Ochs (profiledlater) who sang about injustices and mocked hypocrisy across the politicalspectrum. In 1976, Ochs killed himself. He was not the only one of myanti-authoritarian heroes who met a tragic end.After graduating high school, I went to Queens College at the City University ofNew York because it was completely free. I became a psychology major butdiscovered that most of what was in the textbooks was either silly or obviousand in no way illuminating. I was lucky to have one psychology professor, ThomVerhave, who didn’t take the psychology department seriously. He had been a bigshot in academia and had personally known famous big shots such as RichardHerrnstein, co-­author of The Bell Curve, which espoused a genetic and racistview of IQ and intelligence. Thom would refer to Herrnstein as “Dickie,” pokefun at him, and explain to us the pseudoscience behind IQ testing. Thom combinedcynicism about psychology academia with kindness for his students, and he wasthe only genuinely anti-­authoritarian psychology professor who I would everhave.As a psychology major, it became clear that the only way to assure some kind ofcareer was to get a PhD; and to have options outside of academia, it meantgetting a PhD in clinical psychology; and to get a license in that, it washelpful to have gone to a program that was approved by the AmericanPsychological Association. I got accepted in one such program in the New YorkCity area but having been a fairly compliant student much of my life, I thoughtit was time to “get off the train” for a while. So in 1977 I used all my savingsto bum around Europe, which in the days of free or modest tuition was not thatunusual even for working-class kids.After returning from four months of traveling, I moved back with my parents.Feeling lost and trying to avoid life as much as possible, I stayed up late intothe night and slept late into the afternoon, doing pretty much nothing for acouple of months. In retrospect, I consider myself lucky that my parents weren’tdoctors, lawyers, or professional types who sent their young adult kids likemyself to psychiatrists. When, later in life, I got to know people who also hadbeen lost in their youth, got labeled with serious mental illness, and shippedoff to psychiatric hospitals, I would think of Phil Ochs’s lyrics, “There butfortune, may go you or I.”Lost but lucky, I muddled through, eventually getting a ridiculous job takingmoney from hospital patients who had to pay for TV use. Between my job and beinghome with my parents, I was ready to get back to school. In 1978, I entered agraduate program at the University of Cincinnati, with free tuition and stipendsenough for me to survive without taking out any loans.In graduate school, much of the socialization and professionalization wasdirected at convincing us that we were “scientists,” as scientists are among themost esteemed of societal authorities. To that end, we were required to takemultiple classes on statistics and research design so as to be a higherauthority than psychiatrists in evaluating the scientific quality of research.And we took courses on assessment and testing so as to be a higher authoritythan psychiatrists in the area of classifying children and adults with regard tointelligence and mental disorders. It was clear that a major goal of our programwas to establish that we were authorities that should be given societalprestige.It didn’t take long for the rude awakening that the ticket to career advancementfor ambitious professionals had to do far less with knowing what they weretalking about than appearing like they did. Philosopher Harry Frankfurt, authorof On Bullshit (2005), distinguishes between liars and bullshitters. The liarknows the truth, and the liar’s goal is to conceal it, while the goal ofbullshitters is not necessarily to lie about the truth but to persuade theiraudience of a specific impression so as to advance their agenda. In the case ofacademic bullshitters, I discovered that they were especially committed topersuading others of their importance.I had already learned from Thom Verhave, my Queens College professor, how theseIQ tests conveniently omit areas of intelligence that most academics are notgood at. For example, these tests do not assess the intelligence it takes to befunny and not bore an entire class; to read body language; to see throughbullshit; or to stay alive on the streets in a dangerous neighborhood.Psychologist academics routinely have no great intelligence in these areas, andso, of course, these capacities are omitted from IQ tests.In addition to IQ tests, it was obvious to me that the psychiatric diagnosticbible—the DSM, published by the American Psychiatric Association—was far more apolitical than a scientific instrument. When I began my graduate school trainingin 1978, many psychologists did not take the DSM-II (1968) seriously, and evenmany psychiatrists questioned its scientific value. And so the APA set about tocreate a revision, the DSM-III (1980), that professed to have made the DSMvalid, reliable, and scientific. The APA repeatedly promulgated that the DSM-IIIhad accomplished these goals, but it was not true.It was obvious to me that the DSM was about as scientifically valid asLeviticus. The authors of both DSM and Leviticus simply labeled those behaviorsthat made them uptight. In Leviticus, these anxiety-producing behaviors werelabeled “abominations” and “sins,” and in the DSM they were labeled “mentalillnesses” and “mental disorders.” In Leviticus, homosexuality is anabomination; and in DSM-II, homosexuality was a disorder. Homosexuality was notlisted as a disorder in the DSM-III only because gay activists—assisted by achanged cultural climate in the 1970s—had enough political clout to abolish thisinsult to their sexual identity. However, noncompliant youngsters had no suchpolitical clout, and so in the DSM-III, “oppositional defiant disorder” wascreated for them.Early in graduate school, I discovered that challenging authorities got melabeled as having “issues with authority.” This was somewhat amusing for me, asamong the working-class kids who I had grown up with, I was consideredrelatively compliant with authorities, as I had done my homework, studied, andreceived good grades. But in this extremely compliant environment of graduatetraining, I was being seen as a “bad boy.” In graduate school, the clinicaldirector—who would repeatedly tell us about his days at Yale—accused me ofhaving “authority issues.” Since he was an authority, I realized that if Idefended myself that would prove his point, so I initially said nothing inresponse. But finally after he repeatedly baited me, I responded, “I don’t haveauthority issues. I just have issues with authorities who don’t know what theyare talking about.”It became obvious to me that gaining acceptance into graduate school or medicalschool and then gaining a PhD or MD to become a psychologist or psychiatristrequired an extraordinary amount of compliance to authority. It became clear tome that the selection and socialization of mental health professionals bred outmany anti-authoritarians, and this—as I will later detail—has significantconsequences in the pathologizing of noncompliant and rebellious people.After acquiring my PhD and clinical psychologist license, I then hid out inprivate practice. However, by the early 1990s, I had become so embarrassed by myprofession that I felt a need to publicly separate myself from it—first througha letter to the editor, then in articles, and eventually with books and talks.By 1994, I had become aware of a political movement of ex-­patient “psychiatricsurvivors” and dissident mental health professionals. This movement aims atabolishing pseudoscience and coercive treatment as well as providing the generalpublic with “informed choice.” I’ve been involved in this world ever since.While none of my previous books have been specifically about authoritarianismand anti-authoritarianism, in retrospect, I realize that virtually all mypublications have been geared for anti-authoritarian readers. While I hadpreviously written a few articles about anti-authoritarians, I had long thoughtthat this subject required an entire book. When the anti-authoritarian AK Pressinvited me to write a book for them, I thought that they were the rightpublisher for Resisting Illegitimate Authority."},{"pageContent":"2: THE COMPLIANT, THE NONCOMPLIANT, AND THE ANTI-AUTHORITARIANDefining Terms / The Percentage of Americans Who Resist Illegitimate Authority /The Authoritarian and Anti-Authoritarian “Personality” and Left-Right PoliticsLyndon Johnson famously proclaimed his requirements for an appointee: “I wanthim to kiss my ass in Macy’s window at high noon and tell me it smells likeroses.” Johnson and his ass-­kissers were authoritarians.Defining TermsAuthoritarian is defined by the American Heritage Dictionary as “characterizedby or favoring absolute obedience to authority, as against individual freedom;of, relating to, or expecting un­­questioning obedience.” Authoritarians withpower demand unquestioning obedience from those with lower rank. Andauthoritarian subordinates comply with all demands of authorities.Anti-authoritarians, in contrast, reject unquestioning obedience to authority.Anti-authoritarians question whether or not an authority is legitimate beforetaking that authority seriously. And anti-authoritarians challenge and resistillegitimate authorities.Anti-authoritarians oppose the imposition of illegitimate authority not only onthemselves but on others as well. This is why Gold Hat is no anti-authoritarian,as while he did not for himself take seriously the state’s societal badges, hesought unquestioning obedience to himself.For anti-authoritarians, evaluating the legitimacy of those in authorityincludes questioning the legitimacy of societal badges. Anti-authoritariansassess whether authorities actually know what they are talking about, andwhether they are competent, honest, have integrity, and care about those peoplewho are trusting them. And when anti-authoritarians determine an authority to beillegitimate, they challenge and resist that authority, whether the authority istheir doctor, teacher, parent, or government.Dissent is different than disobedience. A person may dissent with an authoritybut may still obey. People who are capable of dissent but incapable ofdisobedience are uncomfortable challenging the very legitimacy of that authorityto wield power. Anti-authoritarians are comfortable with both dissent anddisobedience, as they are comfortable questioning, challenging, and resistingauthority they deem to be illegitimate.Anti-authoritarian is not synonymous with noncompliant. In the 1932 movie HorseFeathers, the noncompliant Professor Wagstaff, played by Groucho Marx, isoppositional—not anti-­authoritarian—when he sings: “Your proposition may begood, but let’s have one thing understood, whatever it is, I’m against it. Andeven when you’ve changed it or condensed it, I’m against it.”Oppositional is defined as the actions of opposing, resisting, defying, and/orcombating. Before young people become anti-­authoritarians, they are oftenoppositional; as before they pride themselves on distinguishing legitimate fromillegitimate authority, they can pride themselves on their noncompliance. Thus,it is troubling that being oppositional and defiant has been pathologized by theAmerican Psychiatric Association as a mental disorder called “oppositionaldefiant disorder.” This psychopathologizing and resulting “treatment” make itmore difficult for young people’s prideful noncompliance to mature into thisvital societal contribution: discerning an authority’s legitimacy, and resistingillegitimate authority.Contrarian is also not synonymous with anti-authoritarian. A contrarian rejectspopular opinions and goes against current practices. Contrarians, for example,are selling their stock when the stock market is rising and when most are buyingstock; and they are buying stock when the stock market is plummeting and mostare selling. A contrarian may reject a war when it is popular, but also call forunpopular military actions. Contrarians reject popular opinion, whileanti-authoritarians reject illegitimate authorities. Anti-authoritarians andcontrarians have in common a certain fearlessness around being unpopular,disliked, and ostracized; and so sometimes contrariness andanti-authoritarianism exists within the same person.All genuine anarchists are anti-authoritarians, however, not allanti-authoritarians are anarchists. Anarchism literally means “without rulers,”and the Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines it as: “a political theory holdingall forms of governmental authority to be unnecessary and undesirable andadvocating a society based on voluntary cooperation and free associations ofindividual groups.” Among anarchists, there is no monolithic view of anarchismthough there is generally agreement that the state is an illegitimate authority.Some anarchists self-identify as libertarian socialists, who believe insocialism but oppose state socialism. However, the term libertarian, especiallyin the United States, is now routinely associated with the Libertarian Party andpeople who oppose state coercions but don’t view capitalism as essentiallycoercive. So for example, Emma Goldman (profiled later), identified herself asan anarchist, while Marilyn Chambers (porn star and the 2004 Personal Choicevice presidential candidate), identified herself as a libertarian. Both Goldmanand Chambers opposed state authority and both celebrated sexual freedom, butthey differed on the coercive nature of capitalism. For anarchists, both thestate and capitalism are illegitimate authorities that are coercivelydehumanizing.One iconic anarchist poster reads, “Fuck Authority,” which feels good for manyanarchists to say. However, for anti-­authoritarians who are not anti-state(such as Thomas Paine and Ralph Nader, both profiled later), it is not “FuckAuthority” but rather: “Fuck Unjust Authority,” “Fuck Stupid Authority,” andcertainly “Fuck Illegitimate Authority.”Authoritative has a very different meaning than authoritarian, and thedistinction is important. Authoritative means being accurate, true, reliable,valid, and thus trustworthy. Part of being a legitimate authority is to beauthoritative. For example, my longtime car mechanic has a lengthy history ofbeing authoritative—competent, honest, and trustworthy—and if he tells me thatmy brakes are unsafe, I take him seriously and comply with his recommendation toreplace them.The idea of taking any authority seriously might upset certain anarchists,however, not those who are familiar with Mikhail Bakunin (1814–1876), one of themost famous anarchists in world history. Bakunin wrote: “Does it follow that Ireject all authority? Far from me such a thought. In the matter of boots, Irefer to the authority of the bootmaker; concerning houses, canals, orrailroads, I consult that of the architect or the engineer. . . . But I allowneither the bootmaker nor the architect nor the savant to impose his authorityupon me. I listen to them freely and with all the respect merited by theirintelligence, their character, their knowledge, reserving always myincontestable right of criticism and censure.”Perhaps the most well-known modern American anarchist is linguist and politicalactivist Noam Chomsky (profiled later), and he too would not say, “FuckAuthority.” For Chomsky, every form of authority has to “prove that it’sjustified—it has no prior justification.” Chomsky gives an example of justifiedauthority: “When you stop your five-year-old kid from trying to cross thestreet, that’s an authoritarian situation: it’s got to be justified. Well, inthat case, I think you can give a justification.” However, for Chomsky, “Most ofthe time these authority structures have no moral justification . . . they arejust there in order to preserve certain structures of power and domination.” Myguess is that Chomsky would be okay with the anti-­authoritarian poet WaltWhitman’s advice: “Resist much, obey little. Once unquestioning obedience, oncefully enslaved.”It is important to distinguish between anti-authority and anti-authoritarian, asthe two terms have different meanings. Anti-authority means being in oppositionto all authority. Anti-authoritarian means opposing authoritarians andillegitimate authority. Unfortunately, some social scientists such as ChristianBay in The Structure of Freedom (1958) have equated anti-­authority withanti-authoritarian, viewing anti-authoritarianism as a syndrome andpathologizing it. The anti-authoritarian, for Bay, “represses awareness of hisown weakness and dependency needs. He sees all authorities as bad and wicked,and all weak people as exploited and persecuted.” For people who oppose allauthority, one can debate whether this psychological analysis has any merit; butanti-authoritarians are not opposed to all authority, only illegitimate ones—andso this psychological analysis is irrelevant.Totalitarianism is an authoritarian system of government that recognizes nolimits to its authority, attempts to regulate every aspect of life, and demandscomplete subservience. George Orwell’s novel 1984 describes a totalitariangovernment, and Orwell is known for having condemned the totalitarianism of boththe so-called “Right” and the so-called “Left,” from National Socialism andfascism to Stalinism. More later on confusions about Left-Right politicalbattles over authoritarianism and anti-authoritarianism as well as on thepolitical battle about the “authoritarian personality” and the“anti-authoritarian personality.”The Percentage of Americans Who Resist Illegitimate AuthorityThere is a continuum from extreme authoritarianism to extremeanti-authoritarianism, and at different points in people’s lives and underdifferent circumstances, people may be at different points on this continuum.Under periods of great anxiety and fear, an individual, family, society, ornation can become more receptive to authoritarian measures of unquestioningobedience; and anti-authoritarian attitudes have been more normalized in someextraordinary periods of American history.How many of us obey or disobey illegitimate authority? This estimate will varydepending on the assessment method.A 2012 Harris Interactive survey asked American adults: “Given the recentreports concerning the threat posed by terrorists who plan to implant bombswithin their own bodies, how willing, if at all, would you be to undergo a TSA[Transportation Security Administration] body cavity search in order to fly?” Abody cavity search consists of one’s mouth, anus, and vagina being probed andinspected by uniformed authorities—an extreme invasion of one’s physicalprivacy, and so one can argue that only an authoritarian who unquestioninglyobeys authority would comply. The poll reported that 15% of American adults are“completely willing” to comply, and that an additional 15% are “somewhatwilling.” And so, a total of 30% would comply with authority and submit to sucha privacy violation in order to board a plane. Results were virtually the samewith self-­identified Democrats and Republicans (15% of both Democrats andRepublicans were “somewhat willing,” and 15% of Democrats and 16% of Republicanswere “completely willing”).Another question on the Harris Interactive survey was: “How reasonable orunreasonable do you feel it is that travelers should be made by law to obeyevery command given by a TSA agent inside an airport or any other public placegiven the threat posed by terrorists?” A majority of Americans, 57%, considereda law to obey every command to be either completely or somewhat reasonable.However, surveys only detect people’s self-perceptions and not their actualactions. Perhaps the most famous attempt to discover how rampant authoritarianbehavior was in U.S. society was psychologist Stanley Milgram’s “obedience toauthority” studies. Milgram was deeply affected by how many people complied withNazi authoritarian directives to commit atrocities, and in the early 1960s, hesought to discover how far ordinary Americans would go in obeying an authority’sharmful commands.In the original Milgram study at Yale University, 40 male volunteers wererecruited for an experiment ostensibly investigating learning. They were paid“$4.00 plus 50 cents carfare” for showing up (paid regardless of whether or notthey discontinued participation). These subjects were introduced to anotherparticipant, who was actually a confederate in league with the experimenter. Thenaïve subjects were the “teachers” and the confederate was the “learner,” andthere was also the experimenter authority. Each teacher subject was given anactual “sample shock” of 45 volts so that they could experience what learnerswould be receiving in the experiment (though in the experiment, the confederatelearner did not receive actual shocks but pretended to be shocked).In the most well-known variation of the experiment, 26 of 40 teacher subjects(65%) continued to shock the confederate learner to the highest level of 450volts even as the confederate learner pounded the walls to protest and no longeranswered after 315 volts. While 65% never disobeyed the experimenter authority,even the 35% who ultimately disobeyed at higher shock levels showed asignificant degree of obedience.Specifically, in the experiment, the learner confederate was strapped to a chairwith electrodes. After the learner was taught a list of word pairs, the teachersubject was told by the experimenter authority to administer an electric shockevery time the learner made a mistake, increasing the level of shock each time.There were 30 switches on the shock generator marked from 15 volts (labeled as“slight shock”) to 450 volts (labeled as “Danger: severe shock”). Theconfederate learner purposely gave mainly wrong answers, and for each wronganswer, the teacher subject was told by the experimenter authority to give thelearner an electric shock. When the teacher subject objected, the experimenterauthority gave a series of orders/prods to ensure they continued (Prod 1:“Please continue”; Prod 2: “The experiment requires you to continue”; Prod 3:“It is absolutely essential that you continue”; and Prod 4: “You have no otherchoice, you must go on”). Milgram reported, “At 75 volts, the ‘learner’ grunts.At 120 volts he complains verbally; at 150 he demands to be released from theexperiment. His protests continue as the shocks escalate, growing increasinglyvehement and emotional. At 285 volts his response can only be described as anagonized scream.”Milgram carried out several variations of this study, altering the situation tosee how this affected obedience. The authority’s “badges” were significant. Inthe original study, the experimenter authority wore a grey lab coat uniform as asymbol of his authority, but in one variation, the uniformed experimenterauthority was called away and replaced by an experimenter in everyday clothesrather than a lab coat; and here the 450-volt highest-level obedience ratedropped from 65% to 20%. In another variation, when the site of the experimentwas moved from Yale University to a run-down office, the 450-volt highest-levelobedience rate dropped to 47.5%. Proximity to the experimenter authority figurealso changed the compliance rate, as when the experimenter authority telephonedorders rather than being in the same room, the obedience rate fell to 20.5%.Another variation of the experiment shows the importance of modelingdisobedience in order to reduce compliance with illegitimate authority. When twoother participant teachers were also confederates (sitting next to the teachersubject) refused to obey—one stopping at 150 volts, and the other stopping at210 volts—the level of obedience was reduced from 65% to 10% compliance for thehighest-level shock.Milgram’s studies on obedience to authority have been replicated many times inthe United States and around the world with slightly different methodologies butsimilar results. Milgram believed that the obedient were not without moralitybut that their morality was an authoritarian morality. He noted, “Although aperson acting under authority performs actions that seem to violate standards ofconscience, it would not be true to say that he loses his moral sense. Instead,it acquires a radically different focus. . . . his moral concern now shifts to aconsideration of how well he is living up to the expectations that the authorityhas of him.”One criticism of Milgram’s conclusions, leveled by sociologist MatthewHollander, was that obedience and disobedience are more nuanced than Milgramdepicted. Hollander analyzed the dialogue from audio recordings of Milgram’sstudy participants, and he found that people classified as obedient triedseveral different forms of verbal protest saying “I can’t do this anymore” or“I’m not going to do this anymore” but they ultimately continued. For Hollander,this was an attempt at disobedience. But for Milgram, these protests weredissent, not disobedience, and what’s crucial is that dissent withoutdisobedience had no value for the shocked “learner.”The Authoritarian and Anti-Authoritarian “Personality” and Left-Right PoliticsWithin the mainstream American media, the rise of the Republican presidentDonald Trump energized renewed concern about authoritarianism. While Trump is acaricature of a wannabe strongman, some of the most authoritarian presidentialactions in U.S. history have been administered by Democratic presidents—fromAndrew Jackson’s forced removal of the Cherokees and the ensuing “Trail ofTears”; to Grover Cleveland’s use of the army to break up the Pullman Strike; toWoodrow Wilson’s incarceration and deportation of World War I resisters; toBarack Obama’s prosecution of more government whistleblowers under the EspionageAct than all previous administrations combined.The 1950 publication of The Authoritarian Personality, authored by sociologistTheodor Adorno along with psychologists Else Frenkel-Brunswik, Daniel Levinson,and Nevitt Sanford, stirred up both methodological and political controversies.A large part of the impetus for this work was the then-recent Nazi regime’sgenocidal atrocities. Adorno in Germany had been an important member of theInstitute for Social Research, which came to be known as the Frankfurt School.He fled Germany in the 1930s. In The Authoritarian Personality, Adorno and hisco-authors hoped to identify personality factors that resulted in anti-Semiticand fascist behaviors.The Authoritarian Personality included exhaustive research on differentpopulations and was influenced by Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis. One of itsmajor theories was that the authoritarian personality type was, in part, aresult of punitive parenting causing repressed anger with parents along with afear of them; thus resulting in a fear of questioning and challengingauthorities and, ultimately, worshiping punitive authority figures. Adorno andhis team measured authoritarianism by the “F-Scale,” short for “pre-fascistpersonality.” The F-Scale variables included: conventionalism; authoritariansubmission; authoritarian aggression; anti-intraception (rejection ofinwardness, the subjective, the imaginative, and self-criticism); superstition;power and toughness; destructiveness; projectivity (perception of the world asdangerous); and exaggerated concern for sexual behaviors. (In 2006, psychologistBob Altemeyer found that only three of these variables actually correlatedtogether: authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, andconventionalism.)By seeking psychological explanations for authoritarianism and fascism, Adornoangered some orthodox Marxists who viewed human actions purely as a product ofeconomics. And by equating the “authoritarian personality” with the politics ofthe Right, Adorno also upset conservatives and libertarians who objected to theomission of the authoritarian Left.People such as Adorno and his co-authors who identify themselves as on the Leftroutinely associate authoritarianism with the Right, and those on the Right seean authoritarian Left. For the Left, Hitler, Mussolini, Franco and theright-wing ideology of fascism’s demand for unquestioning obedience to the stateare examples of authoritarianism. However, for the Right, Stalin, Pol Pot andKhmer Rouge communism also demanded unquestioning obedience and are examples ofLeft authoritarianism.In The Anti-Authoritarian Personality, the Left political scientist WilliamKreml attempted to establish anti-authoritarian personality attributes. ForKreml, those possessing anti-order, anti-power, impulsiveness, and introspectionattributes “will tend toward the acceptance of Left-wing political views.”However, there are non-Left, self-identified libertarians who would also claimthose attributes.Libertarian philosopher David Makinson argued that since authoritarians engagein coercion, anti-authoritarianism is synonymous with anti-coercion. Coercionmeans the use of force, threats, and intimidation to break resistance and obtaincompliance. However, to equate anti-authoritarianism with anti-­coercionoverlooks the necessity of coercion as a tool for resisting and removingillegitimate authorities. By definition, anti-­authoritarian resistance oftenrequires coercions directed at these authorities. Coercions vary. For example,American colonials used violent revolution in order to remove the illegitimateauthority of Great Britain. In India, Mahatma Gandhi used methods such as hungerstrikes, which though called “nonviolent,” are still coercive.More recently there have been other efforts to discover what kind of people haveauthoritarian tendencies and who, when they become insecure and anxious, desirea strongman leader. Leading social scientists in this field include socialpsychologist Jonathan Haidt and political scientists Karen Stenner, MarcHetherington, and Stanley Feldman.Feldman attempted to create a more reliable measure of authoritarianism byunlinking it from political ideology. In the early 1990s, Feldman beganmeasuring authoritarianism by using four questions about parenting, askingrespondents to state which they thought to be more important for a child: (1)independence or respect for elders? (2) self-reliance or obedience? (3) to beconsiderate or well-behaved? (4) curiosity or good manners? Feldman’squestionnaire received a great deal of attention for the association of itsmeasure of authoritarianism with a higher likelihood of being a Republican voterand for predicting Donald Trump voters. But political scientist Samuel Goldmanbelieves that these parenting questions are not apolitical—that what is called“authoritarian” by Feldman’s scale could be called “old-fashioned parentingvalues” that are more common among blue-collar than white-collar people, andmore common in the South than the rest of the United States.The conventional Right-Left distinction—especially for many oppressed groups—isnot all that useful when examining authoritarianism. For many oppressed groups,the difference between the Right and the Left is only in their techniques usedto coerce conformity and gain control.While the Right favored killing indigenous Americans to steal their land,so-called progressives on the Left favored forced assimilation through boardingschools that prohibited the use of tribal languages and customs, which made iteasier to divide and conquer Native people—and then steal their land.For oppressed homosexuals in the United States, again the Right and Leftdiffered only on the kind of techniques used to coerce conformity and gaincontrol. The Right favored criminalizing and imprisonment, while progressives onthe Left favored “treatment” for homosexuality, including aversive conditioningtechniques involving electric shock and nausea-inducing drugs duringpresentation of same-sex erotic images.The limitations of categorizing anti-­authoritarians by Right-Left can be seenin the evaluations of figures like Thomas Paine and Ralph Nader, who are bothprofiled in the following chapter. There are libertarians who claim ThomasPaine, using his famous anti-government quote “Society in every state is ablessing, but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil.”However, Paine was not anti-government or anti-state. He advocated for agovernment that had a progressive estate tax, social security for the aged, anda government that would abolish inequality, poverty, exploitative taxation, andinadequate wages. But Paine was also no socialist, as he did not call for landcollectivizing or redistribution, and he believed in private enterprise. Painecannot be placed into today’s Right-Left spectrum, but he was clearly ananti-authoritarian, a fierce opponent of illegitimate authority. Similarly,there are few more passionate anti-authoritarians than Ralph Nader; and Nader,like Paine, is not anti-state but for a government that promotes social andeconomic justice and freedom."},{"pageContent":"PART TWO: THE ASSAULT ON U.S. ANTI-AUTHORITARIANS"},{"pageContent":"3: GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS DO NOT PREVENT MARGINALIZATION:Thomas Paine, Ralph Nader, and Malcolm XToday in the United States, it is politically correct to have high regard andeven awe for famous Americans who have challenged and resisted illegitimateauthority. However, many of these same anti-authoritarians were hated andshunned at their life’s end. The extraordinary lives of the following group ofanti-­authoritarians offer evidence that even the greatest of contributions donot inoculate anti-authoritarians from marginalization in U.S. society.It may seem odd to see Thomas Paine, Ralph Nader, and Malcolm X in the samegroup, but they have commonalities. The boldness of actions by Paine, Nader, andMalcolm X separated themselves from their contemporaries, even from those withsimilar political views. All three, by virtue of their extraordinary talents andsome luck, were remarkably successful in positively transforming the lives ofmillions of Americans. All three cared little about wealth or personallyprofiting from their contributions. All three were unintimidated by the violenceof the illegitimate authorities whom they challenged and resisted. All threerefused to tolerate hypocrisy in anyone, and for that, all three were punishedseverely. Paine was ostracized by a nation that he, in major ways, had helped tocreate. Nader was shunned by progressives after his unparalleled progressiveaccomplishments. And Malcolm X was assassinated by members of a religiousorganization despite his genius for making their institution a large andpowerful one.With respect to their legacies, there are also similarities. Thomas Paine andMalcolm X, hated at the time of their deaths, are now American icons with U.S.postage stamps honoring them both—but with the most radical aspects of theirlives and politics largely ignored. And Ralph Nader too will likely share thatfate.Anti-authoritarians’ refusal to be intimidated by the political consequences ofchallenging authority can—at the right moment in time and with some luck—besuccessful. What can catch anti-authoritarians by surprise is that no matter howimportant their supporters have deemed their past contributions, if their otheranti-authoritarian actions create problems for their supporters, admiration canquickly turn to abandonment and assault. What is especially sad is how previousextraordinary accomplishments in no way mitigates the ferocity of theseassaults.Thomas Paine“He had faults, like other men; but it was for his virtues that he was hated andsuccessfully calumniated.”—Bertrand Russell, “The Fate of Thomas Paine,” 1934“One by one most of his old friends and acquaintances had deserted him. Malignedon every side, execrated, shunned and abhorred—his virtues denounced as­vices—his services forgotten—his character blackened, he preserved the poiseand balance of his soul.” —Robert Ingersoll, “Thomas Paine,” 1892Thomas Paine (1737–1809) was one of the most influential anti-authoritarians innot only U.S. history but in world history. In Thomas Paine and the Promise ofAmerica, his biographer Harvey Kaye tells us, “He fought to liberate men andwomen from the authoritarianism of states, classes, and churches and to empowerthem to think for and govern themselves.” Yet despite Paine’s great talents,unparalleled accomplishments, famous friends, popularity, and admiration, hewas, at the end of his life, hated and shunned by virtually an entire nationthat he had a large part in creating.Paine came to the American colonies just before the ­outbreak of theRevolutionary War in one of the more anti-­authoritarian eras in Americanhistory, and he took advantage of these circumstances to become—for atime—widely admired. Like the other anti-authoritarians who I profile, Paine wascompelled to challenge all illegitimate authorities regardless of politicalconsequences. He would come to denounce and ridicule the most popular man andthe most popular belief system in the United States. This resulted in Painebeing ostracized and marginalized in U.S. society in the last years of hislife—and long after his death. Paine’s legacy has had a historical comeback, andhe is today honored for challenging and resisting British control over colonialAmerica, and he is admired for his role in fomenting the American Revolution.But his historical comeback has been based on a convenient neglect of his mostpolitically incorrect condemnations.Born Thomas Pain, later changing the spelling to Paine, he was to become a majorpain in the ass for authorities around the world. As a teenager, he apprenticedto his stay-maker (corsetmaker) father. As a young adult, Paine became anexciseman (a government official who inspects and rates articles liable to tax),but he was fired after two years for claiming to have been working whileactually studying at home. He became a poorly paid schoolmaster until he wasable to get reinstated as an exciseman. Paine and other excise officers askedParliament for higher pay and better working conditions, and Paine published hisfirst political work in 1772, The Case of the Officers of Excise; and in early1774, he was fired again from the excise service. His other financial effortsfailed, and to avoid debtors’ prison he sold his household possessions.Paine’s first wife had died in 1760, a year after their wedding; and, by 1774,he was separated from his second wife, and his financial life was in shambles.Paine saw the British system—Parliament, the monarchy, and hereditaryauthority—as the reason for his failure. Paine’s personal pain compelled him togain justice for himself and others similarly oppressed. He was committed toexposing the illegitimacy of the British system of rule, and there was no betterplace to do that than in colonial America where Paine would find a receptiveaudience.At age 37, Paine was a “societal loser,” but he then got a huge break, meetingBenjamin Franklin in London. Franklin was impressed by Paine and provided himwith a letter of recommendation (calling Paine an “ingenious, worthy youngman”). Franklin’s name was gold in colonial America, especially in Franklin’shome town of Philadelphia, where Paine immigrated to in 1774, using Franklin’srecommendation to great advantage.“Paine arrived in America,” notes biographer Eric Foner, “with a uniquecombination of resentments against the English system of government andopportunities for immediate self-­advancement and self-expression.” In January1775, Paine became editor of the Pennsylvania Magazine, and he proceeded toincrease its circulation. In March 1775, Paine called for the abolition ofslavery, pointing out the hypocrisy of white colonials complaining about Britishtyranny while being silent about their own slaveholding.Paine was a working-class guy and thus quite different from most of the elitist“founding fathers.” As late as November 1775, Thomas Jefferson wrote that “thereis not in the British Empire a man who more cordially loves union with GreatBritain than I do,” and Kaye also reported that George Washington continued totoast King George III at dinners with his officers. In contrast, Paine viewedthe entire British authority—not just Parliament—as illegitimate, and he wouldvoice the then-taboo word independence.Paine sensed that colonial America was craving a down-to-earth writer who coulddescribe why Great Britain was an illegitimate authority. “Paine’s importance inhistory,” concluded Bertrand Russell (English philosopher, mathematician,historian, and social critic), “consists in the fact that he made the preachingof democracy democratic.” Paine was, Russell noted, “an innovator in the mannerof his writing, which was simple, direct, unlearned, and such as everyintelligent workingman could appreciate.”In January 1776, Paine published Common Sense, at first anonymously, but soonafter he became known as its author. In it, Paine made clear that it wasn’t justthe current bad king or the current bad government leaders but the entire notionof monarchy, aristocracy, and the British system of rule that was illegitimate.Common Sense is what most U.S. students are taught about Paine, as it remainshis most politically correct work.In the three months following its publication, 150,000 copies of Common Sensewere distributed; and including pirated editions, an estimated 500,000 copieswere circulated throughout the colonies during the course of the AmericanRevolution. At that time, there were approximately three million free colonialinhabitants, and so Common Sense was read by an astonishing percentage ofcolonial America. No other writer was so widely read, but Paine refused tofinancially profit by it.Six months after the publication of Common Sense, in July 1776, the ContinentalCongress ratified the Declaration of Independence. The American Revolution wasin full steam by late 1776 when Paine published a series of pamphlets, TheAmerican Crisis. This was a propaganda effort meant to inspire a dispiritedcolonial army and prevent George Washington’s troops from quitting on him, aswell as to help Washington maintain his job as commanding officer. To inspirehis soldiers, Washington had the first Crisis read aloud to his troops, whichbegins with these now famous words: “These are the times that try men’s souls.”Following the success of the American Revolution, Paine returned to Europe tohelp incite revolution there. Paine’s Rights of Man (first part published in1791) refuted the British conservative Edmund Burke’s criticism of the FrenchRevolution, criticized the William Pitt–led government of Great Britain, andobjected to hereditary rule. The second part of Rights of Man (1792) describedsocial programs to reduce poverty of the commoners. Rights of Man became aninternational sensation and stimulated reform societies.In England, Paine became the object of a smear campaign conducted by the enragedWilliam Pitt. The British public was told that Paine had, historian Jill Leporereports, “defrauded his creditors, caused his first wife’s death by beating herwhile she was pregnant, and abused his second wife almost as badly, except thatshe wasn’t really his wife, because he never consummated that marriage,preferring to have sex with cats.” Paine’s friend, poet William Blake, convincedhim that if he remained in England he would be hanged, and so Paine bolted forFrance, narrowly missing arresting officers.Paine had been enthusiastic about the French Revolution, and his Rights of Manmade him a celebrity in France where he was granted honorary French citizenship.Despite his inability to speak French, Paine was elected to the French NationalConvention. However, Paine’s integrity again got him in trouble withauthorities—this time with the authoritarian Robespierre and his fellowJacobins. While Paine championed abolishing the French monarchy, he opposedcapital punishment; and he reminded the French people that King Louis XVI andthe aristocrat Lafayette had both helped liberate the American colonies fromEngland. Paine’s loyalty to American Revolution supporters and his opposition totheir being guillotined incurred the wrath of the Jacobins who had gained power.The Jacobins first expelled Paine from the Convention and then imprisoned him.Paine fully expected that his friend George Washington would get him releasedfrom prison. Paine had dedicated Rights of Man to Washington, and Washingtonremained popular in revolutionary France. The fiercely loyal Paine could notimagine that Washington would not help him. After all, it was Paine’s TheAmerican Crisis that had kept Washington’s troops from deserting him; and whenthe Continental Congress was questioning Washington’s leadership, Paine had usedhis propaganda skills in The American Crisis to make Washington appear to be asmarter strategist than he was. Paine also raised money for Washington’scolonial army. However, as is common for many anti-authoritarians, Paine was aninnocent when it came to political machinations.At the time of Paine’s imprisonment, the American minister to France wasGouverneur Morris, and Morris had a grudge against Paine for exposing Morris’sfriend’s corrupt dealings during the American Revolution; so Morris had noinclination to help Paine. Also, while Paine was in a French prison, Washingtonwas secretly negotiating a treaty with England that betrayed France; and so itwas in Washington’s political interest to have Paine rot in prison, unable toinform the French of this betrayal. Paine narrowly escaped the guillotine andcame close to dying of illness caused by his prison stay. Luckily for Paine,Morris was replaced by James Monroe, who immediately procured Paine’s releaseand brought him into his home in France, where it took well over a year forPaine to recuperate.Paine, hurt and angered by Washington’s disloyalty, never forgave him. In 1796,Paine published his Letter to George Washington, a bitter rebuke of Washingtonthat included the following: “And as to you, sir, treacherous in privatefriendship (for so you have been to me, and that in the day of danger) and ahypocrite in public life, the world will be puzzled to decide whether you are anapostate or an impostor; whether you have abandoned good principles, or whetheryou ever had any.”Paine, Russell observed, “incurred the bitter hostility of three men notgenerally united: Pitt, Robespierre, and Washington. Of these, the first twosought his death, while the third carefully abstained from measures designed tosave his life. Pitt and Washington hated him because he was a democrat;Robespierre, because he opposed the execution of the King and the Reign ofTerror.”Even with his diatribe against Washington, Paine still had political allies, andhe would not have been completely shunned and marginalized if he hadn’tpublished another sensational bestseller. That book, The Age of Reason,challenged biblical scriptures and organized religion, including Christianity.Many of his fellow Founding Father deists privately agreed with Paine’s viewsabout religion but were politically astute enough to not publicize their viewsand to distance themselves from Paine.In The Age of Reason, Paine challenged the authority of the Bible and organizedreligion from a moral point of view, just as he had attacked the immorality ofthe British system of rule and the French Jacobins. All, for Paine, were crueland thus illegitimate authorities, and Paine, being Paine, could not back off.He wrote that “all national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christianor Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify andenslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.” While admiring the moralityof Jesus, Paine dubbed Christianity as a “species of Atheism” for it “professesto believe in a man rather than in God.”In The Age of Reason, part 2 (1795), Paine’s refutation of the scriptures andChristianity was written, Foner points out, “in a tone of outrage and ridicule .. . in manner designed to reach a mass audience.” Regarding the story of Jesus’sbirth, Paine wrote: “Were any girl that is now with a child to say, and even toswear to it, that she was gotten with child by a ghost, and that an angel toldher so, would she be believed?”Paine’s condemnation of Christianity was shocking at the time and remainsshocking today for many people. Paine said: “Of all the systems of religionsthat ever were invented, there is none more derogatory to the Almighty, moreunedifying to man, more repugnant to reason, and more contradictory in itself,than this thing called Christianity. Too absurd for belief, too impossible toconvince, and too inconsistent for practice, it renders the heart torpid, orproduces only atheists and fanatics.” Paine alienated himself from virtually allChristians, including progressive reformers who had been Paine admirers.Paine’s 1796 pamphlet Agrarian Justice, unknown to most Americans, endears himtoday to Left-populists. Agrarian Justice is an attack on the sources ofinequality and poverty, which Paine blamed on unfair taxation, inadequate wages,and unwise government expenditures. In it, he spelled out proposals for old-agepensions and a basic income. Agrarian Justice, especially compared to Paine’sprevious works, was widely ignored and remains so.At age 65, in 1802, Paine returned to the United States, as Foner describes,“only to find himself first vilified and then ignored.” A Boston journalistdescribed Paine as a “lying, drunken, brutal infidel.” Even former friends andallies abandoned him. Benjamin Rush, a close friend in Philadelphia, refused tosee him. Samuel Adams, also once a friend, issued a public letter denouncingPaine. Many innkeepers refused him service. Foner notes: “Paine slipped intoobscurity. His final years were ones of ‘lonely, private misery.’ He wasisolated from almost all his old associates and friends, and again began todrink heavily.”In 1806, Paine wrote, “My motive and object in all my political works . . . .[has] been to rescue man from tyranny and false systems and false principles ofgovernment, and enable him to be free, and establish government for himself.” Bythen, few Americans cared about anything Paine had to say, and in 1809, he diedin a rooming house in Greenwich Village, New York City. Six mourners attendedhis funeral (compared to 20,000 mourners at Benjamin Franklin’s funeral), withalmost no mention of his death in the American press. Even the peace-lovingQuakers refused Paine’s request for burial in their cemetery.John Adams, a longtime fierce enemy of Paine’s vision of genuine democracy andof Paine himself, admitted, “Without the pen of the author of Common Sense, thesword of Washington would have been raised in vain,” and he acknowledged in1805, “I know not whether any Man in the World has had more influence on itsinhabitants or affairs for the last thirty years than Tom Paine.” However, anenvious Adams was tortured by the prospect that “History is to ascribe theAmerican Revolution to Thomas Pain [sic].” Adams called Paine “profligate andimpious,” and he wrote to Thomas Jefferson in 1819, “What a poor ignorant,malicious, short-sighted, Crapulous Mass, is Tom Pains [sic] Common Sense.”For many years after his death, Paine was either attacked or ignored by theAmerican political and cultural elite. In The Life of Thomas Paine, published afew months after Paine’s death, James Cheetham vilified him as “vain,”“intemperate,” “dirty,” “hypocritical,” “parasitical,” “unpatriotic,” “atheist”and a “copier of ideas.” Cheetham accused him of seducing and abandoning hisfriend and housekeeper Madame de Bonneville (one of the six people at Paine’sfuneral), and she successfully sued Cheetham for libel. However, despiteCheetham’s libelous falsehoods, those who hated Paine and what he stood for,“cared little about Cheetham’s veracity,” Kaye notes, “and his book suppliedanti-Paine invective to generations of conservatives to come.” In 1888, TheodoreRoosevelt called Paine a “filthy little atheist”; yet, historian J. H. McKennapoints out, “Paine was fastidiously clean, stood taller than most of hiscontemporaries at five feet ten inches, and was a professed believer in God.”Paine has come to be admired for Common Sense and for his role in fomenting theAmerican Revolution. In 1969, he was honored with a “Prominent Americans” seriesU.S. postal stamp. But Paine’s historical comeback is based in large part on aconvenient neglect for his scathing condemnation of Christianity. As Leporenotes, “So wholly has The Age of Reason been forgotten that Paine’s mantle hasbeen claimed not only by Ronald Reagan but also by the Christian Coalition’sRalph Reed, who has invoked him, and the North Carolina senator Jesse Helms, whoin 1992 supported a proposal to erect a Paine monument in Washington, D.C.”Reviewing four books about Paine as well as an examination of the historicalview of him, Lepore concludes: “Paine emerges in most academic accounts as akind of idiot savant; savvy about adjectives but idiotic about politics.” Paineis viewed as “hopelessly naïve,” and even “an ignoramus,” and one of Paine’sbiographers offers a tentative diagnosis of bipolar disorder.Among his more anti-authoritarian biographers such as Harvey Kaye, Paine isviewed more sympathetically, as “inquisitive, gregarious, and compassionate, yetstrong-willed, combative, and ever ready to argue about and fight for the goodand right.” For many famous and non-famous anti-­authoritarians, theircompulsion for truth-telling makes it difficult for compromises and diplomacy.Foner concludes, “Paine was at his best at the very moment of overthrow, whenprinciples of government were called into question and new classes emerged intopolitical life. But Paine was temperamentally and intellectually unsuited forthe day-to-day affairs of government.”Similar to many non-famous anti-authoritarians, Paine disregarded cautions fromfriends; and, though loyal to his friends, Paine was more loyal to his ownintegrity. His onetime friend Benjamin Rush cautioned him against the use of thethen-taboo word independence, but he disregarded Rush. His friend James Monroetried to dissuade him from publishing his diatribe against George Washington,but Paine published it anyway.Paine was a political ally with Thomas Jefferson in several areas (with slaverybeing a major exception). However, Paine’s friendship with Jefferson became asignificant political liability for Jefferson whose enemies used it to attackhim, especially with respect to questions of Jefferson’s own religious beliefs.Jefferson, after he had become president, risked political capital by offeringPaine transportation back to the United States on a public vessel (which Painedeclined). However, soon after his return to the United States, Paine composedanother series of letters reviving his hostility with John Adams and GeorgeWashington during a time when Jefferson was attempting to foster reconciliation.Another of Paine’s friends, William Duane, warned Paine not to publish theseletters. Duane later said to Jefferson that he had told Paine that he “will bedeserted by the only party that respects him or does not hate him—that all hispolitical writings will be rendered useless—and even destroyed.” But again Painewas stubborn, and ultimately Jefferson too severed his relationship with him.Without Paine’s personal papers, which burned in a fire, it is difficult to knowfor certain whether Paine didn’t care about the consequences of his attack onChristianity or was naïve about key elements of American society and Americanpolitics. Many self-identified American Christians who would have stood with himin his battle for social reforms that he spelled out in Agrarian Justiceabandoned Paine because of his attack on Christianity. Paine, like manyanti-authoritarians, could not back down from challenging any authority that hebelieved was illegitimate. But his attack on Christianity deprived him of allpolitical capital to create social and economic justice in U.S. society.So beyond the personal tragedy of Paine’s later life, there was a politicaltragedy. Egalitarian Americans who cared about greater social and economicjustice and who could have used a politically powerful legacy of Thomas Paineand his Agrarian Justice were deprived of it because of Paine’s attack onChristianity. For Paine, Christianity was a major illegitimate authority, andhis integrity compelled him to challenge it.One of Paine’s few nineteenth-century admirers, Robert Ingersoll, concluded thatPaine had “more courage than politeness; more strength than polish. He had noveneration for old mistakes—no admiration for ancient lies. He loved the truthfor truth’s sake, and for man’s sake. He saw oppression on every hand, injusticeeverywhere; hypocrisy at the altar; venality on the bench, tyranny on thethrone; and with a splendid courage he espoused the causes of the weak againstthe strong—of the enslaved many against the titled few.”While Paine can be viewed as a compulsive truth teller, he cannot be viewed ascompulsively self-destructive. During his early life as a societal “loser,” hedisplayed impressive resiliency. He took full advantage of his lucky breakconnecting with Benjamin Franklin, and he recognized and used his talent ofbeing a plain-speaking and provocative writer. Despite his sad end, Paine didmuch right so as to have an extraordinary anti-authoritarian life.That Thomas Paine’s extraordinary accomplishments in no way mitigated theviciousness of the assault on him is a sad reflection on his society. This darkreality about U.S. society continues to catch naïve anti-authoritarians bysurprise—as well as to create anxiety and extreme vigilance for other U.S.anti-authoritarians.Ralph Nader“Ralph, go back to examining the rear-end of automobiles. . . and don’t riskcosting the Democrats the White House this year as you did four years ago.”—Jimmy Carter, Democrat Convention, 2004“Outside of Jerry Falwell, I can’t think of anybody I have greater contempt forthan Ralph Nader. No one in the history of the world is on a bigger ego tripthan Ralph Nader.”—James Carville, Democrat Party Strategist, 2006“The Democrats just totally trashed the guy. . . . They’re the meanest bunch ofmotherfuckers I have ever run across.”—James Ridgeway, Journalist, 2006For Thomas Paine, illegitimate authorities were the British rule over America,hereditary rule, monarchy, the Bible, clerics, and Christianity. For Ralph Nader(born 1934), illegitimate authority is corporatism—an oligarchy composed ofgiant corporations, the super-rich, and elected officials from both theRepublican and Democratic Parties who do their bidding.No American anti-authoritarians rose to greater national popularity than Paineand Nader, and none took larger falls in terms of popularity. Both, buoyed byearlier successes at slaying authoritarian giants, confronted other illegitimateauthorities, and this resulted in both being punished with severemarginalization. Both are “radicals” in the sense of confronting root causes ofmisery and suffering, but neither are anti-state or anti-­government. Bothfought for genuinely democratic governments that protect and improve the livesof its citizens.While Paine biographies do not include illuminating childhood stories of hisanti-authoritarianism, Ralph Nader biographies do. In 1938, his mother, RoseNader, took Ralph and her other three children for a visit to the family’snative country, Lebanon. On the visit, the Nader family stood in line to meet anarchbishop of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The archbishop stopped in front ofeach person who bent down and kissed the archbishop’s ring. This continued,Nader biographer Kevin Graham reported, “until he came to a small four-year-oldboy who looked up at the archbishop and shook his head.” The boy was RalphNader, who then told the archbishop, “I don’t have to kiss your ring.”Nader is an anti-authoritarian but not anti-authority. He grew up respecting andadmiring his father and mother. His father, Nathra Nader, emigrated from Lebanonto the United States in 1912. Nathra said, “When I passed by the Statue ofLiberty, I took it seriously,” resulting in a lifelong passion for speaking hismind and teaching his children that speaking one’s mind was part of being anAmerican. Nathra moved around the United States, finally settling in Winsted,Connecticut, opening a restaurant where Ralph would sometimes help out. One daywhen Ralph was ten years old and had returned from school, his father asked him:“What did you learn at school today? Did you learn how to believe or did youlearn how to think?” Ralph Nader proudly tells that story, and he recounts howhis father also told him, “If you do not use your rights, you will lose yourrights.”Ralph Nader is equally proud of his community-activist mother, Rose Nader.Frustrated by government inaction over flooding and destruction in Winsted, whenRose heard that Connecticut’s then-Senator Prescott Bush (George H.W. Bush’sfather) planned to attend a campaign reception in Winsted, she waited in thereceiving line until she could shake his hand. Then she did not release his handfrom her strong grip until she exacted a promise from him to build a backupsystem that would catch water flowing over the existing dam—and that system wasin fact built.As a boy, Nader read biographies about turn-of-the-­century muckrakers. AtPrinceton, he read an average of one book a day outside of his required coursework. He then went to Harvard Law School but concluded, “From day one I laughedat the game—to prepare corporate lawyers. . . . They made minds sharp by makingthem narrow.” Nader recounted, “I didn’t like Harvard Law all that much. . . .It was basically a high-priced factory. But instead of producing toasters orblenders, they were producing lawyers to serve corporations, and that was it.”Not taking Harvard Law School too seriously, Nader periodically left andhitchhiked around the United States, researching and writing about the lack ofrights of Native Americans and migrant workers. He also started researchingautomobile safety after seeing car crashes during his travels. He laterrecounted, “I hitchhiked so much . . . that on a number of occasions, we werethe first on the scene of traffic accidents. . . . I saw lots of terriblesights.” He also could not forget about a friend whose car accident resulted inhim becoming a paraplegic, and how that could have been prevented by seatbelts.In 1959, at age 25, Nader gained attention with an article in the Nation aboutdesign dangers of automobiles.While many idealistic young people in the early 1960s were drawn to the civilrights movement, Nader began working on a human rights issue that virtuallynobody was working on—“human body rights.” Continuing his auto safety research,Nader would eventually publish Unsafe at Any Speed: The Designed-In Dangers ofthe American Automobile, and he would come under attack by General Motors andthe automobile industry.Unsafe at Any Speed was published in 1965 when Nader was 31. Nader’s researchshowed that death and injuries were being caused by cars designed for style andnot for safety. Most famously, the design problems of GM’s Corvair causedrollovers and needless deaths. The book provoked Americans to become appalled byautomobile executives who were aware of design flaws but did nothing to fixthem. Unsafe at Any Speed became a bestseller (and is today listed by theLibrary of Congress as one of the 88 “books that shaped America”). Nader thenbecame an adviser to Senator Abraham Ribicoff (D-CT) for his auto-safetyhearings.Although there was evidence that the public would pay more for safer cars,automakers did not want to be told what to do. Auto executives did not want toput in the extra expenses for auto safety, and they feared that “giving in” herewould lead to acceding to pollution controls, fuel efficiency, and othermeasures for a healthier society. So auto executives at General Motors tried toshut Nader up.GM communications records showed that GM wanted to get dirt on Nader to smearand marginalize him. Nader recounted that while in a grocery store, anattractive woman walked up to him and asked him back to her apartment to helpher, and after Nader declined, he noticed that she did not ask anyone else. Asimilar encounter with an attractive woman occurred shortly later in adrugstore. Nader believed he was being followed, and he sounded to some friendsas if he had become delusional and paranoid. However, detectives following himwere ultimately caught when they asked a building’s security guard about Nader’slocation; the guard, himself studying to be a lawyer, got the detectives’ names.Nader later said, “The surveillance became so amateurish in the end that it wasalmost like a slapstick comedy.”Senator Ribicoff, chairing Senate hearings, asked the CEO of GM, James Roche, ifGM had hired a detective agency to follow Nader. Roche admitted that GM had doneso and apologized. Nader later sued GM, with GM settling in 1970 for $425,000(after legal fees, $280,000), which Nader used—not on himself—but as seed moneyfor his consumer activist groups. Nader has had few financial needs—famouslyfrugal, buying his clothes at thrift stores, never owning a car or a television,and never marrying and having to provide for a family.Thomas Paine had taken on Great Britain, the most powerful nation on the planetat that time. Ralph Nader had taken on GM, the largest corporation in the UnitedStates at that time with larger gross sales than many nations’ gross domesticproduct. Both Paine and Nader triumphed. Given these triumphs, it isunderstandable that both these anti-authoritarians believed that they coulddefeat any illegitimate authority.At the auto-safety Senate hearings, Nader was asked about his advocacy motivesand responded: “Because I happen to have a scale of priorities that leads me toengage in the prevention of cruelty to humans.” For Nader, as was the case withPaine, the practice of cruelty and exploitation most defined an authority asillegitimate. Nader’s Senate testimony was crucial to Congress passing theNational Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act in 1966, which resulted in theNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Ralph Nader may well be responsible for saving more lives from consumer productdeaths than anyone in world history. The National Center for Statistics andAnalysis concluded that from 1975 to 2004, over 195,000 lives were saved just byseatbelts (and many other serious injuries prevented). In 2015, the Nationreported that based on an analysis of deaths per mile driven, the Center forAuto Safety found that, taking into account all auto safety-related measuresattributable to Nader, over the past 50 years, he had helped avert 3.5 millionauto deaths. Seatbelts are only one of many automobile safety measures thatNader is responsible for, and automobile safety is only one of several “humanbody rights” that Nader helped bring into existence.By 1970, Nader and “Nader’s Raiders” (the young consumer advocates who Nadercame to inspire and lead) were responsible for the following safety and humanrights protections: the Occupation and Safety Health Act (OSHA); lawestablishing Environmental Protection Agency; Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act;Safe Water Drinking Act; Clean Water Act; Nuclear Power Safety; Wholesome MeatAct; Clean Air Act; Mine Health and Safety Act; Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;Freedom of Information Act; and the Whistleblower Protection Act.Thus, Americans owe a good part of the quality of their everyday lives directlyto Ralph Nader and the consumer advocates who he inspired. In the late 1960s andearly 1970s, polls showed Nader was among the most admired and trusted Americans(behind only Walter Cronkite). At the same time, Ralph Nader had become the manthat corporate America feared most.In 1971, Lewis Powell (prior to becoming a justice on the Supreme Court) wascommissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to write a confidential memo titled“Attack on the American Free Enterprise System,” and Powell offered a ­counterattack strategy for corporate America. Powell stated: “Perhaps the single mosteffective antagonist of American business is Ralph Nader, who—thanks largely tothe media—has become a legend in his own time and an idol of millions ofAmericans.” Part of corporate America’s strategy was to use their financialpower to ensure that Nader and other consumer advocates could no longer count onDemocratic Party politicians (who, as with Senator Ribicoff, Nader hadpreviously counted on).When Democrat Jimmy Carter was elected in 1976, Nader naively believed that withDemocrats retaking the White House along with Democrat control of the Senate andthe House of Representatives, it would make it easier for the consumer movement.Carter had voiced support for the consumer movement and had even hired someNader allies. And so Nader was confident of the passage of a proposed billcreating a Consumer Protection Agency (which aimed at providing an ombudsman forconsumers and was a popular bill with the general public). The bill passed inthe Senate but lost in the House. Nader later said about Carter: “At thecritical moment when we needed his lobbying help in the House ofRepresentatives, he did not expend the political capital.” Jimmy Carter wouldultimately disappoint progressives by cutting social programs and increasing themilitary budget.The Democratic Party in the 1980s began aggressively pursuing corporate money,and this further increased in the 1990s. Even more disappointing and frustratingfor progressives than Carter was Democratic president Bill Clinton’s corporatistagenda (e.g., passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, passage of thePersonal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, and repeal of theGlass–Steagall Act). However, Nader still was not ready to completely give up onthe Democrats. “From 1980 to 2000,” Nader recounted, “we tried every way to getthe Democrats to pick up on issues that really commanded the felt concern indaily life of millions of Americans, but were issues that corporations didn’twant attention paid to.” Clinton and his vice president Al Gore refused to meetwith Ralph Nader, and Nader could not convince them to support even the mostpolitically popular anti-corporatist agenda.Finally, Nader could no longer stomach the Democratic Party’s complete betrayal,and he concluded that the United States now has “one corporate party with twoheads.” What became increasingly clear to Nader was confirmed by formerDemocratic Party operatives such as Lawrence O’Donnell (later an MSNBC politicalanalyst) who said, “If you don’t show them you’re capable of not voting forthem, they don’t have to listen to you. I promise you that. I worked within theDemocratic Party. I didn’t have to listen to anything on the Left while I wasworking in the Democratic Party.”Nader previously had declined offers to run for office, and continued voicing apreference that someone other than him step forward to challenge theDemocratic-Republican corporatism. However, Nader ultimately came to theconclusion that “this two-party elected dictatorship has turned politics intosuch a dirty word that the whole idea of elected public service is nowdistasteful to thousands and thousands of wonderful people in this country.That’s when I said, okay, that’s the final straw. I have got to step forward.”In 1996, Nader ran as the Green Party candidate and got less than 1% of thevote. This did not greatly upset the Democratic Party because Clinton handilydefeated a weak candidate, Republican Bob Dole, who was further weakened by theRoss Perot candidacy.In 2000, Nader ran again as the Green Party candidate for president opposingboth the Republican George W. Bush and the Democrat Al Gore. Nader’s goal was toget 5% so as to qualify for the federal matching funds for the Greens in 2004.Given the Clinton-Gore pro-corporatist agenda, progressive Americans were evenmore disgusted with their two major party choices. Consequently, Nader attractedover 10,000 people at several rallies across the United States who paid toattend so as to contribute to the campaign, with over 20,000 at his event atMadison Square Garden in New York City. But the mainstream press gave littlemention to Nader’s enthusiastic support. Nader was frozen out of the debates bythe Democrats and Republicans who controlled them—this despite the fact thatpolls showed that two-thirds of Americans wanted Nader to be permitted toparticipate. In order to just be part of the audience at a Gore-Bush debate,Nader got an admission ticket but was threatened with arrest and turned away.After Gore was narrowly defeated in Florida and lost the electoral-college voteto Bush, Nader not only received the expected rebukes from mainstream Democratsbut received even greater scorn from so-called “progressive” former admirers ofhim. One can get a sense of the vitriol of progressives’ attacks on Nader in the2006 documentary An Unreasonable Man.Eric Alterman, columnist for progressive publication the Nation, stated aboutNader: “The man needs to go away. I think he needs to live in a differentcountry. He’s done enough damage to this one. Let him damage somebody else’snow. . . . To me, he’s a very deluded man. He’s a psychologically troubled man.”Todd Gitlin, former president of the Students for a Democratic Society, statedabout Nader’s 2000 presidential run: “I find this worse than naive. I think itborders on the wicked.”Since 2000, there has been an ongoing marginalization of Nader by mainstreamDemocrats and progressives. The progressive website Salon in 2004 stated aboutNader: “He’s made a career of railing against corporate misdeeds. Yet he himselfhas abused his underlings, betrayed close friends and ruled his ­public-interestempire like a dictator.” This is in contradiction with underlings and friends’on-camera interviews in An Unreasonable Man, which show that while Nader, likemany anti-­authoritarians, has at times lacked diplomacy with associates, he hasnot abused or betrayed them. The treatment of Nader after he opposed theDemocratic Party has very much resembled the treatment of Thomas Paine after hehad published The Age of Reason.The politically astute progressive Bernie Sanders has kept his distance fromRalph Nader. Nader reported that Sanders is “obsessed by the way I was shunned.He hasn’t returned a call in 17 years. He’s told people 100 times he didn’t wantto run a Nader campaign.” Despite Sanders’s shunning of him, Nader, supportedSanders’s 2016 run for the Democratic presidential nomination. Moreover, Nadershowed no ego attachment to his own strategy of attempting to make theDemocratic Party more responsive to progressives. In a 2016 WashingtonPost piece, “Why Bernie Sanders Was Right to Run as a Democrat” Naderacknowledged, “Because if he had run as an independent, he would have faced onlyone question daily in the media, as I did: ‘Do you see yourself as a spoiler?’”After Sanders lost the 2016 Democratic Party nomination, Sanders supported theDemocratic candidate Hillary Clinton, who was defeated by Donald Trump (withboth Clinton and Trump having historically high unfavorable ratings of over55%). Both Nader and Sanders attempted strategies aimed at compelling theDemocratic Party to become less corporatist. Both Nader and Sanders failed. Yetit is Nader, despite his huge array of accomplishments, who continues to beshunned and scorned by progressives, with many of those who had once admiredNader being the most vitriolic.For both Ralph Nader and Thomas Paine, actions that resulted in theirmarginalization are seen by former admirers as “ego-trip” departures from theirprevious altruistic activities. However, if one examines the arc of Paine’slife, his compulsion for integrity could not allow him to avoid The Age ofReason without feeling cowardly; and his compulsion for courage would not permitcowardice. Similarly, if one examines Nader’s anti-corporatist career, there isalso a consistent logic resulting in his integrity compelling him to eitherchallenge the Democratic Party or feel cowardly; and like Paine, his compulsionfor courage would not permit cowardice.Both Paine and Nader were venerated for their integrity and courage by admirers,but when they undertook actions based on integrity and courage that caused theiradmirers political pain, these same admirers called Paine and Nader selfish,egotistical, and even wicked.The lives of Thomas Paine and Ralph Nader affirm this: No matter how greatanti-authoritarians’ contribution to society and how much they are admired, theyremain vulnerable to marginalization for a politically incorrect challenge ofauthority. If such an ostracism can happen to Paine and Nader despite theirmonumental contributions, no anti-authoritarian is safe. The anxiety that manyanti-authoritarians experience is not a symptom of mental illness but a sense ofreality.While both Nader and Paine had extraordinary talents, they never would have hadsuch extraordinary accomplishments had they not benefited from two of the moreanti-authoritarian periods in American history. As Ralph Nader stated about hissuccess as a consumer advocate: “Our movement benefited enormously from thehundreds of thousands of people who were fighting [against] the Vietnam War, andfighting for civil rights, who were in the streets. It created the climate, theatmosphere, that made our efforts appear less extreme.” However, while doingbattle with GM was not seen in the mid-1960s as politically incorrect,challenging the authority of the Democratic Party establishment in 2000 wasviewed as so politically incorrect that Nader has been ostracized for it.Thomas Paine likely would have respected Ralph Nader’s reaction to thisshunning. In 2006, Nader stated: “I don’t care about my personal legacy. I careabout how much justice is advanced in America, and in our world day after day,and I’m willing to sacrifice whatever ‘reputation’ in the cause of that effort.And also, what is my legacy? Are they gonna turn around and rip seat belts outof cars? Are they gonna tear air bags out of cars?”Malcolm X“An extraordinary and twisted man, turning many true gifts to evil purpose. . .. Malcolm X had the ingredients for leadership, but his ruthless and fanaticalbelief in vio­lence . . . set him apart from the responsible leaders of thecivil rights movement and the overwhelming majority of Negroes.”—New York Times Editorial, February 22, 1965 (one day after Malcolm X’s death)“Malcolm X had been a pimp, a cocaine addict and a thief. He was an unashameddemagogue. His gospel was hatred.”—Time, March 5, 1965“Malcolm X today has iconic status, in the pantheon of multicultural Americanheroes. But at the time of his death he was widely reviled and dismissed as anirresponsible demagogue.”—Manning Marable, Malcolm X: A Life ofReinvention, 2011We see in the lives of Thomas Paine, Ralph Nader, and Malcolm X (1925–1965) acompulsion to discover truth and assert it, a compulsion for integrity, and acompulsion for courage. We see in all three, a compulsion to not violate theirtrusteeship with the oppressed—a compulsion to not become an illegitimateauthority.Malcolm X psychologically liberated millions of African Americans, validatingtheir anger, encouraging them to assert it, and thus empowering them. For this,he was accused of demagoguery by Americans who did not want to deal with thisanger. However, Malcolm X did not exploit his power for personal gain.Ultimately, he was assassinated for maintaining his integrity.Throughout much of his life, Malcolm X was rocked by trauma in the extreme, andthus the arc of his life is one of the most complex ones among great U.S.anti-authoritarians. As a child, Malcolm was a good student before his familywas ripped apart. Then, as a teenager and young man, he became selfish,predatory, and anti-authority. After his religious conversion, he was for a timedutifully authoritarian within an authoritarian organization. But after hisbreak with the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X’s essential anti-authoritarianism wasclearly seen.For Thomas Paine, Ralph Nader, and Malcolm X, illegitimate authority was unjust,oppressive, and cruel. In Malcolm X’s evolution, he first identified whitepeople as an illegitimate authority; then Elijah Muhammad and his Nation ofIslam; and at the end of his life, the entire structure of wealth and power inthe United States.It is perfectly logical for Malcolm X to initially view white people as theillegitimate authority. He was intimately aware of a lengthy history of whiteviolence.Malcolm X, born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska, grew up for the most part inLansing, Michigan. His father, Earl Little, was an organizer and chapterpresident for the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). Earl Littlebelieved, Malcolm X told us, “as did Marcus Garvey, that freedom, independenceand self-respect could never be achieved by the Negro in America, and thattherefore the Negro should leave America to the white man and return to hisAfrican land of origin.” Malcolm’s mother, Louisa Little, also was active in theUNIA, and Malcolm recounts that she “looked like a white woman . . . she hadstraight black hair” because her father was a white man who had raped Louisa’smother.Malcolm X reported that among the reasons his father became a disciple of MarcusGarvey was that “he had seen four of his six brothers die by violence, three ofthem killed by white men, including one by lynching. . . . Northern white policewere later to shoot my Uncle Oscar. And my father was finally himself to die bythe white man’s hands.” Malcolm’s family home burned in 1929, and his parentsbelieved it was set on fire by the Black Legion, a paramilitary whitesupremacist group affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan.When Malcolm was six years old his father was killed and his mother and theAfrican American community believed that the Black Legion was responsible forhis murder. But the police ruled it a streetcar accident, and the insurer of thelarger of two life insurance policies refused to pay, claiming that his fatherhad committed suicide.Malcolm also saw other white authorities destroy his family. The death of hisfather resulted in the family becoming desperate financially, and his familywent on relief. Malcolm remembered that the state welfare employees would lookat his family like “we were not people,” and he saw these welfare authorities“as vicious as vultures. They had no feelings, understanding, compassion, orrespect for my mother.” He was shamed by peers for being “on relief,” and hebegan stealing and getting caught for it. Malcolm came to feel guilty that hisstealing “implied that I wasn’t being taken care of by my mother,” resulting inher further harassment by welfare authorities. Ultimately, when Malcolm was 13,his mother completely broke down and was committed to the state psychiatrichospital (where she would remain for the next 24 years). At that point, hisfamily fell apart. The children were separated and sent to foster homes. MalcolmX later recounted: “We were having a hard time, and I wasn’t helping. But wecould have made it. . . . I truly believe that if ever a state social agencydestroyed a family, it destroyed ours. We wanted and tried to stay together. Ourhome didn’t have to be destroyed. But the Welfare, the courts, and their doctor,gave us the one-two-three punch. And ours was not the only case of this kind.”In school, Malcolm was also assaulted by white authority. Attallah Shabazz,Malcolm X’s daughter, corrected one depiction of her father by the 1992 movieMalcolm X, pointing out that the film “shows him learning how to read thedictionary as if he didn’t already know how.” The reality was that, as Malcolm Xlater recounted, “in the second semester of the seventh grade, I was electedclass president. It surprised me even more than other people. But I can see nowwhy the class might have done it. My grades were among the highest in theschool. I was unique in my class, like a pink poodle.” When his white teacherasked him about his career ideas, Malcolm told him that he’d like to become alawyer, and his teacher responded, “But you’ve got to be realistic about being anigger. A lawyer—that’s no realistic goal for a nigger.” Malcolm recalled hisreaction to that comment: “I was smarter than nearly all of those white kids.But apparently I was still not intelligent enough, in their eyes, to becomewhatever I wanted to be. It was then that I began to change—inside.”In his early teens, Malcolm left Michigan for the Boston area, then returned toMichigan for a short period, then went to Harlem in New York City. During thistime, he had menial jobs but also became involved in the world of drug dealers,gamblers, and thieves. He returned to the Boston area, and at age 20 in 1945, heand four accomplices committed several burglaries. In 1946, he was arrested andconvicted, and he began serving an eight-to-ten-year prison sentence.In prison, Malcolm connected with John Bembry, a self-­educated fellow convictwho Malcolm greatly respected. Under Bembry’s influence, Malcolm developed avoracious appetite for reading. Malcolm’s siblings wrote to him in prison aboutthe Nation of Islam, which at that time was relatively unknown. The Nation ofIslam was a new religious movement that preached black self-reliance and opposedintegration with white people and that white people were “devils” and inferiorto black people. Malcolm was receptive to that message. He became a member, andwhile still in prison he began a correspondence with its leader, ElijahMuhammad.Paroled in 1952, Malcolm immediately became active in the Nation of Islam,initially as an assistant minister in Detroit, and he quickly establishedhimself as its most talented recruiter in several locations. Biographer ManningMarable documents that in 1953, the Nation of Islam had approximately 1,200members; by 1955, nearly 6,000; and by 1961, it expanded to somewhere between50,000 and 75,000 members. A major reason for this expansion and itsaccompanying financial windfall was Malcolm X’s breakthrough as a nationalspeaker. He was widely regarded as handsome, eloquent, honest, funny, andcharismatic.In 1957, at age 32, Malcolm X gained attention and admiration throughout blackAmerica for standing up to the New York City police following its assault onNation of Islam member Hinton Johnson. After a large crowd gathered outside ofpolice headquarters, the police backed down, allowing Malcolm to assist Johnson.With tensions mounting, Malcolm gave a hand signal for the crowd to disperse,which it did, resulting in a police officer stating, “No one man should havethat much power.” Malcolm had won over the Harlem African American community,and he was increasingly the public face of the Nation of Islam.In the 1965 introduction to The Autobiography of Malcolm X, M. S. Handler, oneof the few white men and reporters for whom Malcolm had some degree of trust andrespect, said: “Although he had become a national figure, he was still a man ofthe people who, they felt, would never betray them. . . . Here was a man who hadcome from the lower depths which they still inhabited, who had triumphed overhis own criminality and his own ignorance to become a forceful leader andspokesman, an uncompromising champion of his people. . . . Humanredemption—Malcolm had achieved it in his own lifetime, and this was known tothe Negro community.”As Malcolm’s own self-confidence grew, he began to question, challenge, andultimately resist the leader of the Nation of Islam, Elijah Muhammad. In 1961,Malcolm X was appalled by the lack of response from the Nation of Islam toviolence directed at one of its members by the Los Angeles Police Department.Then he confirmed that Elijah Muhammad, in serious violation of the teachings ofthe Nation of Islam, was sexually involved with several young secretaries of theorganization and had fathered children with them (Elijah Muhammad confirmed therumors in 1963, attempting to justify his behavior by referring to precedentsset by biblical prophets). Elijah Muhammad, having come to see Malcolm X as athreat to his leadership, exploited the political opportunity to censure andsideline Malcolm following his comment about John Kennedy’s assassination in1963 (“chickens coming home to roost”). In early 1964, Malcolm X publiclyannounced that he was leaving the Nation of Islam.Elijah Muhammad’s Nation of Islam was an authoritarian organization thatdemanded unquestioning obedience, but its initial attractiveness to Malcolm X isunderstandable. The Nation of Islam validated his feelings about theillegitimacy of white authority, provided him with a strong family (thatincluded his biological siblings who were members), and it provided thepreviously selfish and predatory Malcolm a spiritual path to care aboutsomething larger than himself. Malcolm X believed that he was joining anorganization led by someone who truly cared about African Americans. It was onlythrough experience that he came to see that the Nation of Islam was operated bya predatory illegitimate authority.Malcolm challenged and resisted Elijah Muhammad, knowing full well that theNation of Islam would strike back. A high-ranking member, Louis X (who becameLouis Farrakhan and the leader of the Nation of Islam), stated that “such a manas Malcolm X is worthy of death.” Evidence suggests that the Nation of Islamfirebombed Malcolm’s house and then evicted Malcolm and his family from theirhome in Queens, New York.Right after leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X founded Muslim Mosque, Inc.,a religious organization more in line with traditional Islam. He also foundedthe secular Organization of Afro-American Unity, which advocated for Pan-Africanunity. The Nation of Islam had opposed involvement in politics and rejectedvoting in elections; but Malcolm X advised African Americans to exercise theirright to vote, though he cautioned that this might not be sufficient forpolitical change. Malcolm X had not only left the Nation of Islam but hadcompletely intellectually liberated himself from its policies. He hadtransformed himself into a political thinker.Also shortly after leaving the Nation of Islam in 1964, Malcolm X made apilgrimage to Mecca, resulting in his departing from his previously anti-whiteracist views of the Nation of Islam. He wrote in his diary: “Islam bringstogether in unity all colors and classes.” Marable documents that Malcolm X hadcome to believe that God embraced Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike, deniedthat whites were “devils,” and blamed his previous anti-white sentiments onNation of Islam indoctrination. The central point for Malcolm X had now become,Marable concludes, “the necessity for blacks to transform their struggle from‘civil rights’ to ‘human rights,’ redefining racism as ‘a problem for allhumanity.’”When Malcolm X returned to the United States after traveling in the Middle Eastand Africa, he spoke on college campuses and elsewhere, including events for theSocialist Workers Party and their Militant Labor Forum. Marable notes, “Foryears, he had preached the Garvey-endorsed virtues of entrepreneurialcapitalism,” but at the Militant Labor Forum, “when asked what kind of politicaland economic system he wanted, he observed that ‘all the countries that areemerging today from under colonialism are turning toward socialism. I don’tthink it’s an accident.’” Marable notes, “For the first time, he publicly madethe connection between racial oppression and capitalism.”After Malcolm X’s public split with the Nation of Islam, Muhammad Ali, once aclose friend, chose to side with Elijah Muhammad. Ali admitted that part of hiscalculation was fear, “You don’t just buck Mr. Muhammad and get away with it.”By 1965, Malcolm X realized his days were numbered, and two days before hisassassination, he had told his friend Gordon Parks (photographer and journalist)that the Nation of Islam was trying to kill him.On February 21, 1965, Malcolm X was murdered by a group of Nation of Islamassassins. The New York Police Department, the FBI, and the CIA consideredMalcolm X an enemy, and these agencies may well have used infiltrators toinflame tensions between Malcolm and the Nation of Islam. Marable reported thatthere is also evidence that these agencies, through their surveillance, knew ofMalcolm X’s impending assassination but failed to protect him, and then,following his assassination, enabled guilty informants to go free.Malcolm X was committed to asserting the truth, including the truth of hismistakes. While his views on illegitimate authority dramatically changed, he wasconsistent in seeking truth, asserting it, and challenging and resistingauthority that he deemed illegitimate. It is precisely Malcolm’s capacity toself-correct that makes him one of the most extraordinary anti-authoritarians inU.S. history.Near the end of his life, Malcolm X discussed with Parks an incident earlier inhis life when a white college girl had come into a Black Muslim restaurant andasked him what she could do to help. He had told her, “Nothing,” and she left intears. Malcolm X told Parks, “Well, I’ve lived to regret that incident. In manyparts of the African continent I saw white students helping black people. . . .I did many things as a [Black] Muslim that I’m sorry for now. I was a zombiethen—like all [Black] Muslims—I was hypnotized, pointed in a certain directionand told to march. Well, I guess a man’s entitled to make a fool of himself ifhe’s ready to pay the cost. It cost me twelve years.”Between 1965 and 1977, The Autobiography of Malcolm X sold more than six millioncopies. In his 2011 New Yorker piece, “This American Life: The Making andRemaking of Malcolm X,” David Remnick writes, “In 1992, Spike Lee set off a boutof ‘Malcolmania,’ with his three-hour-plus film. In its wake, people as unlikelyas Dan Quayle talked sympathetically about Malcolm. . . . Bill Clinton wore an‘X’ cap.”In 1999, more than three decades after his assassination, enabled by the U.S.government and applauded by most of U.S. society, the U.S. post office issued aMalcolm X stamp. This was not all that dissimilar from Germany in 1961 issuing apostage stamp for Sophie Scholl, a member of the White Rose resisters to theNazi regime. In 1943, after she and other White Rose members were caught by theNazis, her fellow students at Munich University assembled to demonstrate againstWhite Rose, agreeing with the Nazi regime’s promulgation that White Rose memberswere “traitors and defeatists.” In 1943, German newspapers called White Rose“degenerate rogues,” and Sophie Scholl was guillotined. The German government,18 years later, honored Sophie with a stamp.In his 2015 article “To the Memory of Malcolm X: Fifty Years After HisAssassination,” labor union and socialist activist Ike Nahem wrote how Malcolm Xhad been “transformed by ‘mainstream’ forces into a harmless icon, with hissharp revolutionary anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist political programdiluted and softened.” For Nahem, this transformation of the genuinelyrevolutionary Malcolm X into “someone who can be folded into the traditionalspectrum of bourgeois Democratic and Republican party U.S. politics . . . is atravesty of the actual Malcolm X and his actual political and moral trajectory.”The life of Malcolm X is replete with valuable lessons. One lesson is that whenwe have experienced enormous pain from an illegitimate authority, we may bedrawn toward any other authority that validates our pain, and it can becomedifficult to think critically about that validating authority, especially if weare stressed and vulnerable.Malcolm X’s attraction to the Nation of Islam was similar to people whom I’veknown who have been assaulted by psych­iatry and become attracted to the Churchof Scientology, and then become embarrassed when they realize they’ve joined anauthoritarian organization. People damaged by one authoritarian religiousorganization are vulnerable to joining another one simply because it is criticalof what has damaged them. This is also the case with authoritarian politicalorganizations. Many people oppressed by authoritarian company owners becameanti-­capitalists who were uncritical of authoritarian Bolsheviks. The greatnessof Malcolm X lay not simply in his courage to challenge and resist illegitimateauthority but in his courage to reassess his views.As traumatizing as Malcolm X’s young life was, he was lucky in one sense.Nowadays, a teenager with a history of stealing would get a psychiatricdiagnosis of “conduct disorder,” a severe “disruptive disorder,” and such kidsare increasingly prescribed psychiatric drugs. After the breakup of his family,Malcolm lived in foster homes, and foster kids today in the United States areeven more likely to be medicated on antipsychotic drugs than other children. Andso it is quite likely that in today’s world, the young Malcolm would have beenprescribed antipsychotic drugs, and the arc of his life would have been a verydifferent one."},{"pageContent":"4: CRIMINALIZATION OF ANTI-AUTHORITARIANSEmma Goldman, Eugene Debs, and Edward SnowdenAnti-authoritarians are often punished through criminalization, both tomarginalize them and to send an intimidating message to others who may considerchallenging or resisting illegitimate authority. Among the many criminalizedU.S. anti-authoritarians, I profile three people who differ in personality andin ideology: the anarchist Emma Goldman, the socialist Eugene Debs, and thelibertarian Edward Snowden.Emma Goldman, as a girl and young woman, would today likely also bepsychiatrically marginalized for her intense defiance. Eugene Debs, politicallyactive during the same era as Goldman, provides an example of the U.S.government’s wrath at one of its most beloved citizens just for speaking hismind. And Edward Snowden offers a modern example of a “patriotic”anti-authoritarian who challenged the U.S. government for its violation of theU.S. Constitution and paid a great price.Emma GoldmanDuring her lifetime, Emma Goldman (1869–1940) was one of the most famousanarchists in the United States. Her notoriety resulted from her multiplearrests, trials, and imprisonments for anti-authoritarian speech; her numerouslectures to thousands of people across the United States about anarchistphilosophies of freedom from coercion, anti-capitalism, anti-militarism,atheism, women’s rights, birth control, sexual liberation for women andhomosexuals, and other social issues; and her writings, including her two-volumeautobiography, Living My Life.Goldman’s integrity, morality, pain, and passion compelled her to challenge alengthy list of authorities whom she assessed to be illegitimate: her father,teachers, her first anarchist mentor, police, the U.S. government, and later,the Bolsheviks. Her list of enemies ranged from J. Edgar Hoover to VladimirLenin, whom she informed, “I could not co-operate with a regime that persecutedanarchists or others for the sake of mere opinion.”Throughout Goldman’s life, she was unintimidated by governments, popularopinion, or peer pressure. For example, her fellow anarchists pressured her notto defend ­homosexuality because they worried that, as Goldman put it,“Anarchism was already enough misunderstood, and anarchists considereddepraved.” But for Goldman, “I minded the censors in my own ranks as little as Idid those in the enemy’s camp. In fact, censorship from comrades had the sameeffect on me as police-­persecution; it made me surer of myself, more determinedto plead for every victim, be it one of social wrong or of moral prejudice.”As a young child, Goldman’s family lived in Kovno (now Lithuania), then moved tothe German Empire, then to St. Petersburg in Russia. Her mother, Taube, had twodaughters from her first marriage, and after her husband died, she remarried inan arranged loveless marriage to Abraham Goldman, Emma’s father. Emma reportedthat her parents “were mismatched from the first.” In what we would call today ahighly dysfunctional family, Emma’s father would regularly beat the children fordisobeying him, and the rebellious Emma would get beaten the most. Goldman’sbiographer Richard Drinnon reported, “She was whipped, forced to stand in thecorner for hours, or made to walk back and forth with an overflowing glass ofwater in her hands—a lash was her reward for each spilled drop.” Compounding hermisery with her father, Emma noted, “My mother, while less violent with thechildren, never showed much warmth.”Goldman recounted how her father “tried desperately to marry me off at the ageof fifteen.” She protested, begging to continue her studies, to which her fatherresponded, “Girls do not have to learn much! All a Jewish daughter needs to knowis how to prepare gefüllte fish, cut noodles fine, and give the man plenty ofchildren.” Emma’s interest in boys provoked rage in her father, as sherecounted, “He pounded me with his fists, shouted that he would not tolerate aloose daughter.” But Emma disregarded him, “For several months my admirer and Imet clandestinely.” Only one family member provided Emma with warmth and love,her older sister, Helena.School teachers, as was the case for Malcolm X, were abusive for Emma. Hergeography instructor sexually molested Goldman and other girls. She fought backand got him fired. Emma also had a religious instructor who beat the palms ofstudents’ hands with a ruler. In response, Goldman later recounted, “I used toorganize schemes to annoy him: stick pins in his upholstered chair . . .anything I could think of to pay him back for the pain of this ruler. He knew Iwas the ringleader and he beat me the more for it.” A good student, Emma passedthe exam for admission to gymnasium, but to be enrolled she needed a certificateof good character from her religious instructor. In front of her entire class,he refused and declared, Goldman recalled, that “I was a terrible child andwould grow into a worse woman. I had no respect for my elders or for authority,and I would surely end on the gallows as a public menace.”In 1885, her sister Helena made plans to move to New York to join anothersister, Lena, and Emma wanted to accompany Helena, but Emma’s father refused.Desperate, Emma threatened to throw herself into the Neva River, a ploy thattoday could well get a teenage girl admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Instead,her strategy worked, as her father finally agreed to allow her to leave. Sheimmigrated to the United States in 1885, staying with family in Rochester, NewYork.Emma married a fellow worker in 1887, but she quickly discovered that they wereemotionally and sexually incompatible. Within less than a year, theydivorced. For ending this marriage, Goldman reported, “I was immediatelyostracized by the whole Jewish population of Rochester.” She reported that herparents, who had by then also come to Rochester, “forbade me their house, andagain it was only Helena who stood by me.” Helena then financially helped Emmamove to New York City in 1889.New York City was a hub of anarchist activity, and Emma Goldman had been pulledto anarchism as a social and economic justice movement after the execution ofthe Haymarket martyrs in 1887. Almost immediately after arriving in Manhattan,the 20-year-old Goldman connected with two men who would become important forher. One was anarchist Alexander “Sasha” Berkman, who became her lifelong friendand, for a short period, her lover. The other was Johann Most, editor of theradical publication Freiheit.Johann Most was a captivating orator who mentored Goldman in anarchistphilosophy and public speaking. She later recounted, “Most became my idol. Iworshipped him.” However, Goldman didn’t worship him for long. After receivingfeedback from her worker audience, Goldman began seeing errors in Most’sthinking (for example, his belief that workers shouldn’t fight for small gainssuch as fewer hours but focus only on abolishing capitalism). She concluded thatMost “cured me somewhat of my childlike faith in the infallibility of my teacherand impressed on me the need of independent thinking.” For not parroting hisviews, Most terminated his relationship with Goldman, which deeply hurt her.Previous to their split, Goldman had been so loyal to him that she had arguedfor blowing up the office of a newspaper that had humiliated Most (an idea thatBerkman nixed).In 1892, Goldman, Berkman, and his cousin Modest “Modska” Aronstam (laterchanged to Stein) together planned the assassination of steel plant managerHenry Clay Frick during the steelworkers strike in Homestead, Pennsylvania.Berkman was arrested following his failed assassination attempt, and policeraided Goldman’s apartment but found no evidence to indict her. Goldman talkedabout bombing the Pittsburgh courthouse where Berkman was put on trial butdidn’t act on this.Berkman’s actions were condemned by most Americans, but Goldman was appalled byJohann Most’s attack on Berkman. Most had preached “propaganda of the deed” andthe use of violence to instigate change, which Goldman knew had influencedBerkman. While Most had altered his views on violence prior to Berkman’sactions, when Most condemned Berkman, the loyal Goldman used a horsewhip topublicly lash Most. For Most’s faithful anarchist followers, Goldman reported,“My public punishment of their adored teacher roused furious antagonism againstme and made me a pariah.”The Panic of 1893 resulted in high unemployment, hunger, poverty, and unrest,and Goldman, then age 24, spoke at large protest demonstrations, including oneestimated between 1,000 to 3,000 people in Union Square in New York City. Atthis demonstration, Goldman recalled saying: “If they do not give you work,demand bread. If they deny you both, take bread. It is your sacred right!” Forthis, she was arrested for inciting a riot. Goldman reported that police offeredto drop charges and pay her a “substantial sum of money” if she would become aninformer to which, Goldman recounted, “I gulped down some ice-water from myglass and threw what was left into the detective’s face.”At her trial, the judge told her “I look upon you as a dangerous woman in yourdoctrines,” and she was sentenced to one year in prison on Blackwell’s Island.However, her arrest and imprisonment for speaking her mind gained Goldman muchsympathy and popularity. She recounted, “Thanks to my imprisonment and the spacegiven to my name in the newspapers, I also became a celebrity.” When she wasreleased from prison, 3,000 people greeted her, and she soon received manyrequests for interviews and lectures.Affection for Goldman dramatically declined following Leon Czolgosz’sassassination of William McKinley in 1901, which resulted in Goldman beingarrested and held for two weeks. Czolgosz had claimed to have been inspired byGoldman, but he denied that she was involved in his actions. Police could notlink Goldman to the assassination, and she was released from custody.Goldman refused to condemn Czolgosz, instead expressed sympathy for him, “I feelvery deeply with him as an individual who suffers. If I had the means I wouldhelp him as far as I could.” She chastised other anarchists for abandoning him.Her fellow anarchists condemned Goldman, as they knew that support for apresidential assassin was politically detrimental for anarchism, making it easyfor newspapers and politicians to equate anarchism with violence.For Goldman, this attack on her by her fellow anarchists (including from Berkmanin prison) pained her deeply, “Our movement has lost its appeal for me; many ofits adherents filled me with loathing. . . .The struggle and disappointment ofthe past twelve years had taught me that consistency is only skin-deep in mostpeople.” She withdrew from the movement, adopted a pseudonym (Miss E.G. Smith)and practiced nursing, which she had learned during her time imprisoned atBlackwell’s Island (in Europe, in 1896, she had been awarded diplomas inmidwifery and in nursing).Goldman’s absence from the anarchist movement was a brief one. She returned inpart because of the U.S. Congress passing the Anarchist Exclusion Act (alsocalled the Immigration Act of 1903), which was signed into law by TheodoreRoosevelt. The Act included barring any immigrant “who disbelieves in or who isopposed to all organized government, or who is a member of or affiliated withany organization entertaining or teaching such disbelief in or opposition to allorganized government.” For many freedom-loving people—not just anarchists—thiscriminalization of ideology violated what they believed the United States stoodfor. Goldman rejoined the fight.In 1906, Goldman created the publication Mother Earth; and Berkman, after hisrelease from prison in 1907, became editor. Over the next decade, Goldmantraveled around the United States delivering lectures, often with large payingcrowds. She raised money for Mother Earth and raised awareness for causes thatshe cared about. With Berkman involved with another woman, 39-year-old Goldmanfell in love with Ben Reitman, called “the hobo doctor” (for being homeless as ayouth and later providing medical care to the financially impoverished). Goldmanand Reitman shared a commitment to “free love.” However, virtually the entireradical community had contempt for Reitman (labor union activist ElizabethGurley Flynn called him “an insufferable buffoon”). For almost ten years, withReitman as her manager, Goldman was regularly on the road giving talks. Over onesix-month period, she delivered 120 lectures in 37 cities to approximately40,000 people.In 1916, Goldman again was arrested. Among her many lecture topics was birthcontrol, which she believed was hugely important for the empowerment of women.She was charged under the Comstock Law for instructing her audience as to how touse contraceptives. She refused to pay a $100 fine and instead served a two-weekjail sentence.Also in 1916, Woodrow Wilson ran for re-election for president with the slogan“He kept us out of war,” promising to keep the United States out of World War I;but Wilson reversed himself once re-elected. He signed into law the SelectiveService Act of 1917 (also called the Conscription Act), requiring all malesbetween 21 and 30 (later lowered to 18) to register for military conscription.Goldman abhorred war in general, especially the U.S. government’s involvement inthis war, and she loathed conscription. Goldman and Berkman organized the NoConscription League. In June of 1917, Wilson signed the Espionage Act, and laterthat year Goldman and Berkman were arrested under it for conspiring to inducemen not to register for conscription. After their release from prison in 1919,they were deported to Russia, arriving in January 1920.Goldman was an anarchist—not a Bolshevik. She opposed state power of any kind,but she and many other anarchists had been optimistic about the RussianRevolution and its aim of abolishing the oppressive force of capitalism.However, Goldman and Berkman soon discovered the oppressive nature of Lenin’sregime and the new Bolshevik leadership, which suppressed free speech among theworking class. There were horrible living conditions, unrest, and strikes inRussia, most famously in Kronstadt—a bastion of anarchist dissent where theRussian government killed over a thousand strikers and arrested many more, manyof whom were later executed.Goldman, like Malcolm X, not only had the courage to fight for her convictionsbut also the courage to challenge her own convictions and admit her errors,“Getting people out of jail had been among our various activities in America.But we had never dreamed that we should find the same necessity in revolutionaryRussia . . . . we had not yet forgotten how to laugh at our own follies, thoughmore often my laughter only thinly veiled my tears.” Goldman and Berkman leftRussia in 1921, moving to various European cities. Goldman published a book in1923 which she had titled “My Two Years in Russia” but which her publisherretitled My Disillusionment in Russia. Goldman, again compelled to tell thetruth about a cruel authority, enraged many communist loyalists.Scottish anarchist James Colton offered to marry Goldman purely to provide herwith British citizenship, and she agreed in 1925, and this provided her withsome relief and freedom to travel. Beginning in 1928, she spent the next twoyears in Saint-Tropez, France, writing her autobiography, living in a cottage onmoney raised by her admirers (including the wealthy Peggy Guggenheim). Goldman’sautobiography Living My Life was published in 1931. One of the book’s fans wasEleanor Roosevelt, and in 1933, Goldman acquired a visa to speak in the UnitedStates, but she was not allowed to remain. Goldman went to Spain during theSpanish Civil War, and she then spent the remainder of her life in Toronto,where she died in early 1940.We see in the life of Emma Goldman many of the traits of otheranti-authoritarians: a compulsion to speak out against cruelty and illegitimateauthority, no matter what the political cost; a willingness to sacrifice her ownfreedom for the cause of freedom; a compulsion for truth-telling, that includedadmitting her own errors; a fierce loyalty along with a scorn for disloyalty;and a repulsion with hypocrisy. She mocked people who were fascinated by peoplesuch as herself but had no courage and no real sense of social justice, sayingabout bohemianism that it was “a sort of narcotic to help them endure theboredom of their lives.”The wisdom to utilize good luck and opportunities is crucial for manyanti-authoritarians. A major piece of luck for Emma Goldman was the enduringloving support from her sister Helena, as many anti-authoritarians lack supportfrom even one family member. Goldman was also lucky in that the criminalizationof her early anti-authoritarianism gained her great publicity—some of it evenpositive. She parlayed this fame into being a charismatic speaker who couldacquire income from her talks, money which she used for her survival and hercauses. Goldman was lucky to live in an era in which many Americans were curiousabout her and what she had to say.Historians Paul Avrich and Karen Avrich note that “Goldman’s list of hostileimpulses was long.” And so, she was also lucky to live in an era when adolescentrebellion and volatility did not result in psychopathologizing ofanti-authoritarianism as is often the case today. I have talked to manyanti-­authoritarian women who, in their youth, for their anger and rebelliousbehaviors were labeled with “bipolar disorder” and “borderline personality” andheavily medicated. Several of these women have told me that the pathologizing oftheir anger and rebellious behaviors delayed their political consciousness.They, similar to Goldman, experienced abusive authorities; but the labeling oftheir anger as a symptom of mental illness made it more difficult for them tobecome politicized—and recognize that it was the coercions of illegitimateauthorities, not a mental illness, which had fueled their behaviors, and thatthere are political ideologies such as anarchism that address this issue.Emma Goldman’s survival and fascinating life are certainly not solely due togood luck. She had great intelligence, courage, and made several wise choices.Like Malcolm X, Emma used her prison time wisely. During her first stint atBlackwell’s Island, Goldman expanded her knowledge by reading widely andlearning nursing skills, and she quit smoking. And during her time at theJefferson City, Missouri, prison prior to her deportation, Goldman developedstrong bonds with fellow women radicals, including Kate Richards O’Hare, theprominent U.S. socialist, and the Italian anarchist Gabriella Antolini.Though Emma Goldman was a fervent anti-capitalist, she had a passion forindependence and autonomy, and she learned how to survive within a world thatdemands money for survival. She acquired many skills—as a seamstress, nurse,midwife, masseuse, cook, and speaker—and throughout her life would use thoseskills to make money.Paul and Karen Avrich write: “Charismatic, domineering, and sexually free,Goldman was a whirl of willful determination. Unapologetically menacing in herrhetoric, remembered as abrasive and imperious by her friends, she neverthelesswas a driving force within the radical community, and no one questioned hercommitment to her causes.”It is important to note that Goldman was never jailed for acts of violence. Shewas imprisoned for speaking her mind and challenging what she considered to beillegitimate authority. For this, she was incarcerated several times andultimately deported from the United States.Goldman’s life provides more than another famous example of the state’s attemptto punish anti-authoritarian speech with criminalization. Her early life alsoprovides an example of a girl and young woman who today in the United States,from my experience, might well be psychopathologized. Similar to Malcolm X, innot being psychiatrically marginalized, Goldman was lucky.Eugene DebsEugene “Gene” Debs (1855–1926) was imprisoned twice for hisanti-authoritarianism. Unlike Emma Goldman, Debs was a well-mannered, likablechild and a decidedly non-radical young man who attempted to work within thesystem. A conservative labor union leader well into his late thirties, in 1895,he was imprisoned for becoming a reluctant strike leader. At that point, itbecame clear to him that the U.S. government was the property of giantcorporations and the wealthy, who also owned most politicians, the judiciarysystem, the major newspapers, and other institutions. Radicalized by his initialincarceration, Debs became a socialist—ultimately the most influential socialistin U.S. history. He ran for president five times, the last time from a prisoncell, having been convicted for speaking out against the U.S. government’s entryinto World War I.“Eugene Debs had been known as one of the most likeable boys in Terre Haute,”notes his biographer Ray Ginger. Growing up in Indiana, Debs did favors for hiselders and was generous with younger children, providing them with candy fromhis father’s grocery store. Ginger observed that Gene Debs’s “kindliness”remained a dominant motive of his life. Gene dropped out of high school andbegan working in the railroad industry, first cleaning grease from the trucks offreight engines, then as a painter and railroad car cleaner, and then as alocomotive fireman.As a young man, Debs was an advocate of self-improvement, believing in thedoctrine of “lifting yourself by your own bootstraps.” At age 20, Debs leftrailroad work, attended business college, and became a billing clerk for a largewholesale grocery house. Even though he no longer worked in the railroadindustry, Debs maintained loyalty to his fellow workers, and became a member ofthe Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and the editor of their Firemen’sMagazine. He then went into politics, and he never lost an election running as aDemocrat. The voters in his home town of Terre Haute twice elected him cityclerk, and he was elected to the Indiana General Assembly in 1884 at age 29.The Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen was quite tame, notes historian DavidShannon in his article, “Eugene V. Debs: Conservative Labor Editor.” Shannonpoints out, “In its early days the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen was more ofa fraternal lodge and a mutual insurance company than a trade union.” Debs, asFiremen’s Magazine editor, scolded the bad habits of his fellow workers, as heknew that alcohol abuse combined with the lack of occupational safety resultedin job fatalities and serious injuries.Even into his mid-thirties, Debs was anti-strike. He saw the differences thatarise between labor and capital as ones that arise between “friendly brothers.”Debs believed that differences could be settled by reasonable and peacefulmeans, rather than by strikes or violence. Debs preached peace and co-operationbetween labor and capital, and he preached mutual respect, accusing radicallabor union leaders of being cranks and demagogues.Only gradually did Debs begin to recognize the naivety of this “brotherly” view.Reluctantly, he began to accept that a more confrontational approach wasnecessary. He adopted a unifying strategy of organizing an entire industry,creating an “industrial union” rather than organizing trades (such asexclusively the firemen) separately. This resulted in his founding of theAmerican Railway Union (ARU), which struck Great Northern Railway in early 1894and won most its demands.Later in 1894, as leader of the ARU, Debs became involved in the now famousPullman Strike. The strike was precipitated by the Pullman Company cutting wages(a Federal commission estimated a 25% cut, but others estimated the cut to befrom 33% to 40%). Again, Debs was relatively conservative and reluctant tostrike. He reminded workers that the federal government might intercedemilitarily as it had previously done in the strike by silver miners at Coeurd’Alene, Idaho. However, workers rejected his warnings and voted to strike, andDebs joined in.As Debs had predicted, President Grover Cleveland and Attorney General RichardOlney got an injunction against the Pullman Strike. The injunction was enforcedby the U.S. Army, and this broke the strike. Debs scrupulously made all effortsto prevent violence. Nonetheless, Debs was found guilty of contempt of court forviolating the injunction and was sentenced to prison.Debs was not a socialist when he began his prison term. He recalled in 1902 inhis article “How I Became a Socialist” that at the time of the 1894 PullmanStrike, “I had heard but little of Socialism, knew practically nothing about themovement, and what little I did know was not calculated to impress me in itsfavor.” But then, Debs recounted, “a swift succession of blows that blinded mefor an instant and then opened wide my eyes—and in the gleam of every bayonetand the flash of every rifle the class struggle was revealed.” It became clearto Debs that the ownership class has at its disposal “an army of detectives,thugs and murderers . . . equipped with badge.” It was also clear to him thatthis ownership class owned most of the press and politicians. Debs was firstincarcerated in Cook County Jail in Chicago and then imprisoned for six monthsin Woodstock, Illinois. Here, between books and visitors, he came to concludethat capitalism had to be abolished so as to create social and economic justice.“Eugene Debs, a lifelong Democrat who three times campaigned for GroverCleveland,” notes Ginger, “was deprived of faith in the major political partiesby the actions of Cleveland and Olney. He could no longer advocate labor’sadherence to parties which were firmly controlled by the large corporations.”Beginning in 1900, Debs ran as the Socialist candidate for president of theUnited States, and would ultimately run five times. In the 1912 presidentialelection, Debs obtained 6% of the vote, and running from a prison cell in 1920,he garnered 3.4% of the vote.Debs received his most severe punishment from the U.S. government for speakingout against its entry into World War I. Democrat Woodrow Wilson had beenre-elected president on his pledge of neutrality; but, pressured by Wall Street,which had engineered large war loans to the English and French, Wilson reversedhimself and venomously attacked those who did not follow suit.In 1918, Debs gave a speech in Canton, Ohio, stating: “Wars throughout historyhave been waged for conquest and plunder. . . . And that is war, in a nutshell.The master class has always declared the wars; the subject class has alwaysfought the battles.” Debs told the thousands of people in the Canton audience,“They tell us that we live in a great free republic; that our institutions aredemocratic; that we are a free and self-­governing people,” and the crowdresponded in loud laughter. Debs responded to their laughter, “This is too mucheven for a joke.”Under Wilson in the United States, there was no free speech when it came to waropposition. Debs, in his own defense at his trial, pointed out, “The Mexican warwas bitterly condemned by Abraham Lincoln, by Charles Sumner, by Daniel Websterand by Henry Clay.” But anti-war speech during World War I in the United Stateswas not tolerated. Debs was convicted of the willful obstruction of theConscription Act, though Debs had actually been careful to avoid the subject ofconscription in his talk, noting later, “I never mentioned the draft in myspeech, nor made any reference to it.”At his sentencing speech, Debs again affirmed his commitment against violence:“Your honor, I have stated in this court that I am opposed to the form of ourpresent government; that I am opposed to the social system in which we live;that I believe in the change of both but by perfectly peaceable and orderlymeans.” It did not matter. Debs was sentenced to ten years in a federalpenitentiary.Thousands of Americans who knew nothing about socialism knew that Debs was sentto prison for opposing the war. Unlike the arrest and imprisonment of lessfamous or less liked anti-authoritarians such as Emma Goldman, the imprisonmentof Eugene Debs had a chilling effect. During this time period, twelve anti-warpublications were deprived of their second-class mailing permit, and someformerly anti-war publications moderated their views to become more patriotic(this including the once radical New York Forward, the Liberator, and the Appealto Reason). Many radicals who had once called themselves socialists becamepro-war, patriotic Americans. U.S. government intimidation had worked tosuppress opposition. Ginger observed, “America had become a strange land, inwhich Eugene Debs was a bewildered and unnoticed vagabond.”Wilson’s venom for Debs was such that even after the end of the war, Wilsonannounced, “This man was a traitor to his country and he will never be pardonedduring my administration.” Wilson even denied a pardon for Debs when such apardon was recommended because of Debs’s poor health by Attorney General A.Mitchell Palmer (notorious for his “Palmer Raids,” incarcerating and deportingdissenters). Ironically, it was the Republican president Warren Harding,following Wilson, who commuted Debs’s sentence in 1921, and he was released fromthe federal penitentiary in Atlanta.Previous to prison, Debs had suffered from recurrent headaches, severerheumatism, and debilitating low back pain; and Ginger notes, “Prison food hadcompletely wrecked his stomach and his kidneys.” Prison time for Debsexacerbated his health issues, and he died in 1926, shortly before he would haveturned 71 years old.Eugene Debs was a beloved figure, and his treatment by the U.S. government wasshocking for many Americans. Ginger notes, “To most American Socialists, Debshad a status near to divinity,” and Debs was loved not only by radicals but byalmost everyone he encountered. During his incarceration in Atlanta, Debs “wonthe hearts of his fellow prisoners,” notes historian Howard Zinn, as owing tohis presence, guards were “less free with their nightsticks.” When Debs had beenin the prison less than a month, Ginger notes, “The other inmates began callinghim Little Jesus.” Debs did many favors for prisoners and refused any specialprivileges for himself. On the day of his release, more than 2,000 inmatesgathered to say good-bye to him.Debs was so likable that after he was interviewed in 1921 by Attorney GeneralHarry Daugherty regarding amnesty and release, Daugherty recounted: “He spent alarge part of the day in my office, and I never met a man I liked better.” Evenanarchist Emma Goldman who had little patience for socialists, said of hermeeting him, “We parted good friends. Debs was so genial and charming as a humanbeing that one did not mind the lack of political clarity.”After Debs was released from the Atlanta prison, estimates of the crowd thatwelcomed his return to his hometown Terre Haute ranged from 25,000 to 50,000,and Debs was hoisted above the crowd and carried. Sheriff George Eckert, his1895 Woodstock jailer who had become friends with Gene and his wife Kate duringDebs stay in his jail, visited Debs in 1922. Clarence Darrow, Debs’s formerdefense attorney, said after Debs’s death, “I never knew a man whom I loved morethan I did him. No better, kindlier man ever lived than Gene. I shall miss himas I have missed few others.”When Debs died, there was a huge outpouring of national sorrow. Ginger notes,“So it became fashionable to minimize his radical beliefs in favor of his purityof character. On this count he was deemed above reproach.” In this regard, thejournalist Heywood Broun sarcastically commented: “Eugene V. Debs is dead andeverybody says he was a good man. He was no better and no worse when he served asentence at Atlanta.”Debs was revered by the oppressed for the same reason that Malcolm X wasrevered. The oppressed knew that the integrity of those men would never allowthem to exploit their popularity for selfish reasons. Both Malcolm X and EugeneDebs concluded, at approximately the same age, that capitalism was anillegitimate authority that oppressed the majority of people, a realization forboth of them that was based on direct personal experiences.The life of Eugene “Gene” Debs offers another validation for anti-authoritariansas to just how violent the U.S. government can be if one creates tension forit—no matter how nonviolent one’s actions. Debs, similar to Ralph Nader,personifies those anti-authoritarians who initially believe that economic andsocial justice are possible to achieve within the system; but throughexperience, come to realize that the only option is to refuse to comply with anillegitimate authority. Both Nader and Debs came to see the Democratic Party tobe no different than the Republican Party in terms of being corporatist lackeys.The 1979 documentary Eugene V. Debs: Trade Unionist, Socialist, Revolutionarywas written and produced by a 38-year-old Bernie Sanders about his hero. Itbegins: “It is very probable, especially if you are a young person that you havenever heard of Eugene Victor Debs. . . . Why? Why haven’t they told you aboutGene Debs and the ideas he fought for? The answer is simple. More than a halfcentury after his death, the handful of people who own and control thiscountry—including the mass media and the educational system—still regard Debsand his ideas as dangerous, as a threat to their stability and class rule, andas someone best forgotten about.”Ironically, the arc of Bernie Sanders’s political career moved in the oppositedirection from the arc of his hero. Sanders began as an anti-war socialistmember of the Liberty Union Party which rejected the corporatism of both theDemocratic and Republican Parties. Then Sanders got elected to various officesin Vermont and supported popular military expenditures and military actions; andhe ultimately supported the Democratic Party’s pro-militarist presidentialcandidate Hillary Clinton. In contrast, Debs began as a successful Democraticpolitician, became radicalized by his experiences as a labor union leader,became a socialist who was hated by the ruling class, and was imprisoned by itsU.S. government.Sanders began with dissent but moved to obedience, obeying even the DemocraticParty. Debs began conciliatory, moved on to dissent, and then todisobedience—not only disobeying the Democratic Party but the U.S. government.Sanders’s initial dissent propelled his political career, and his ultimateobedience kept his career intact. Debs, in contrast, paid a severe price for hisultimate disobedience.Edward SnowdenEdward Snowden (born in 1983) was charged in 2013 for violating the U.S.government’s Espionage Act of 1917. Unlike Emma Goldman and Eugene Debs, Snowdenwas not charged for speaking out against a war or military conscription. Snowdenwas charged for leaking classified information from the U.S. government’sNational Security Agency (NSA) that revealed mass warrantless surveillance onU.S. citizens. The NSA’s warrantless surveillance is in violation of the Bill ofRights of the U.S. Constitution. For his disobedience and resistance, Snowdenhas been criminalized by the U.S. government.The Fourth Amendment reads: “The right of the people to be secure in theirpersons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches andseizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probablecause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the placeto be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”Attorney and journalist Glenn Greenwald points out that the Fourth Amendment“was intended, above all, to abolish forever in America the power of thegovernment to subject its citizens to generalized, suspicionless surveillance.”When Snowden saw the Fourth Amendment being violated by both Republican andDemocratic administrations, he challenged and resisted their intelligenceagencies.Snowden’s path to resisting illegitimate authority could not have been moredifferent than the anarchist Goldman or the socialist Debs—though Snowden’s“patriotic path” is not unique among U.S. anti-authoritarians.Snowden’s father was an officer in the U.S. Coast Guard, and his mother was achief deputy for the U.S. District Court of Maryland. Snowden grew up as apatriotic American, even more so after the events of September 11, 2001. In2004, Snowden enlisted in the U.S. Army, recounting later, “I wanted to fight inthe Iraq war because I felt like I had an obligation as a human being to helpfree people from oppression.”Snowden was discharged from the army after breaking both his legs in a trainingaccident. Though having dropped out of high school, Snowden had high-levelcomputer skills. He began working for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in2007, but he became alarmed by the George W. Bush administration’s violations ofAmericans’ constitutional rights. Snowden recounted, “I began to understand thatwhat my government really does in the world is very different from what I’dalways been taught. That recognition in turn leads you to start reevaluating howyou look at things, to question things more.” Journalist Ewen MacAskill reportedthat at that time Snowden identified himself as a libertarian, believing in astrong adherence to the U.S. Constitution.By 2009, the 26-year-old Snowden had become so disillusioned by the CIA’sviolation of Americans’ rights that he decided to leave that agency and begancontemplating becoming a whistleblower. He waited to see if the new president,Barack Obama, who had pledged reform, would make good his promises. However, notonly did U.S. intelligence agencies’ unlawful policies continue, the Obamaadministration would ultimately prosecute more government leakers under theEspionage Act than all previous administrations combined.Among intelligence agencies, Snowden focused on the NSA because he reasoned thatpeople might get hurt if he revealed CIA secrets, “But when you leak the NSA’ssecrets, you only harm abusive systems.” So Snowden began working for Dell, anNSA contractor. He then got a position in early 2013 for the U.S. governmentdefense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, where he took a pay cut to be in abetter position to gather data on the NSA’s surveillance activities.In March of 2013, Snowden became even more appalled by the Obama administrationafter its Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, was asked by SenatorRon Wyden: “Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundredsof millions of Americans?” Clapper’s reply was, “No, sir.” Snowden knew this wasa boldfaced lie.It became increasingly clear to Snowden that leaking to the press was the onlyway the American people would hear about U.S. government lawbreaking. Manymembers of the U.S. Congress had previously been briefed by the NSA onwarrantless wiretapping, and they had not told the American public.Thus, in early June 2013, Snowden provided NSA documents that revealed itslawbreaking to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, and Ewen MacAskill.Snowden’s revelations were subsequently published in the Guardian and theWashington Post; and the U.S. government then charged Snowden with violating theEspionage Act. Snowden, who had just turned 30, knew that if he gave himself up,he would have no chance to make his case—in public or in court. He knew that hewould not be allowed out on bail and that his testimony on the stand would begagged by government objections. Thus, having been granted asylum in Russia,Snowden did not return to the United States.Snowden’s thinking reveals the mind of an anti-authoritarian. He recalled, “Ifelt it would be wrong to, in effect, help conceal all of this from the public.”When Greenwald probed Snowden about his motives, Snowden replied, “The truemeasurement of a person’s worth isn’t what they say they believe in, but whatthey do in defense of those beliefs. If you’re not acting on your beliefs, thenthey probably aren’t real. . . . I don’t want to be a person who remains afraidto act in defense of my principles.” Snowden explained to Greenwald, “What keepsa person passive and compliant is fear of repercussions, but once you let go ofyour attachment to things that don’t ultimately matter—money, career, physicalsafety—you can overcome that fear.”Snowden stated that he wanted to spark a worldwide debate about privacy,Internet freedom, and the dangers of state surveillance. He told Greenwald, “Iwant to identify myself as the person behind these disclosures. I believe I havean obligation to explain why I’m doing this and what I hope to achieve.”Greenwald, in No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S.Surveillance State (2014), reported mainstream media’s reaction to Snowden’sactions. When the story broke in June of 2013, CBS News host Bob Schieffercalled Snowden a “narcissistic young man” who thinks “he is smarter than therest of us.” The New Yorker’s Jeffrey Toobin also diagnosed Snowden as anarcissist, specifically “a grandiose narcissist who deserves to be in prison,”and the Washington Post’s Richard Cohen joined the choir, asserting that Snowden“is merely narcissistic.” Politico’s Roger Simon called Snowden a “loser”because he had “dropped out of high school,” and New York Times columnist DavidBrooks mocked Snowden as someone who “could not successfully work his waythrough community college.”Some of the mainstream media did begin to shift their views. A New York Timeseditorial in January 2014 stated: “The shrill brigade of his critics say Mr.Snowden has done profound damage to intelligence operations of the UnitedStates, but none has presented the slightest proof that his disclosures reallyhurt the nation’s security . . . . When someone reveals that governmentofficials have routinely and deliberately broken the law, that person should notface life in prison at the hands of the same government.”Snowden has received more support internationally than he has received fromAmericans; and he has received more support from younger Americans than olderones. A 2015 KRC Research poll, commissioned by the American Civil LibertiesUnion, showed that only 36% of Americans had a positive opinion of him (56%among younger Americans, aged 18 to 34). However, in Germany and Italy, 84%viewed Snowden positively; 80% viewed him positively in France, the Netherlands,and Spain; and 64% viewed him favorably in Australia.U.S. politicians have responded as expected. Politicians such as Bernie Sanders,with support from young people, have supported clemency for Sanders; whileBarack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump all have advocated punishingSnowden.The Milgram study, as previously detailed, revealed that the majority ofAmericans believe in complying with authority even when they feel the authorityis a cruel one. Similarly, the majority of Americans believe “lawbreakers” suchas Snowden should be punished, regardless of the fact that the consequences ofthese lawbreakers violating a law are highly beneficial for society.While the majority of Americans support the criminalization of Edward Snowden,many Americans are also upset about his revelations of their having their FourthAmendment rights violated—and many politicians recognize this distinction. InJuly 2013, a bill to defund NSA’s bulk metadata collection program came up for avote. The bill, the Amash-Conyers Amendment, aimed at ending “NSA’s blanketcollection of Americans’ telephone records,” was narrowly defeated 217–205(supported by 111 Democrats and 94 Republicans), as apparently many politiciansbelieve that their constituents care, as Snowden does, about their FourthAmendment rights.Snowden is in the tradition of U.S. government whistleblowers that includesChelsea Manning. Manning was in the U.S. Army at the time she witnessed the U.S.government’s war atrocities and deceit, and in 2010 she provided supportingdocuments to WikiLeaks. Both Snowden and Manning are in the tradition of DanielEllsberg, an ex-marine employed at the Defense Department and the RANDCorporation. In 1971, Ellsberg leaked government lies about the Vietnam War inwhat came to be known as the Pentagon Papers. In 1973, during a moreanti-­authoritarian cultural climate, U.S. government charges against DanielEllsberg were dismissed because of governmental misconduct and illegal evidencegathering. Sadly, no such anti-authoritarian climate exists today.***Many other U.S. anti-authoritarians, forgotten in history, have beencriminalized for speaking their minds. Politically radical women such as KateRichards O’Hare, Mollie Steimer, and many other Americans were imprisoned forspeaking out against World War I. Also during that era, William Buwalda, amilitary veteran decorated for his service in the Philippines, wascourt-martialed and sentenced to three years at Alcatraz merely for, while inmilitary uniform, attending a talk by Emma Goldman, applauding her, and shakingher hand.There have been many anti-authoritarians for whom criminalization resulted notin prison but by life ruination and self-­inflicted death. Julius Wayland was agood friend of Eugene Debs and was the founder and publisher of Appeal toReason, the largest socialist publication in U.S. history, with a circulation ofapproximately 500,000 at its height. But in 1912, the 58-year-old Wayland,grieving over his wife’s death, was falsely smeared for sexual improprieties;and with the Federal District Attorney about to indict him under the Mann Act,he committed suicide, leaving a note indicating that he was a beaten man. Andanti-authoritarian entertainer Lenny Bruce (profiled later) was hounded by localgovernment authorities for his speech, and he was arrested on obscenity chargesbut died via drug overdose during the appeal process.Some U.S. anti-authoritarians, with luck, have survived U.S. governmentalassault. Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman (both profiled later) escapedslavery and outwitted the U.S. Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Scott Nearing(profiled later), during the same era that Emma Goldman and Eugene Debs wereimprisoned under the Espionage Act, was also indicted under the Espionage Actbut found not guilty. Helen Keller (profiled later), who also publicly opposedmilitary conscription and the U.S. government’s entry into World War I, was notprosecuted by the U.S. government, most likely because Woodrow Wilson knew howridiculous it would have been to jail the most famous deaf-blind woman in theworld.Other U.S. anti-authoritarians have simply been murdered by government agencies.One famous example was Fred Hampton. In 1969 at age 21, Hampton was assassinatedin his sleep by Cook County, Illinois, law enforcement in conjunction with theFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Hampton’s “offense” was being a BlackPanther Party member and an effective organizer. As will be discussed in thefollowing chapter, throughout U.S. history, murder and genocide by the U.S.government has been routine with respect to Native Americans."},{"pageContent":"5: GENOCIDE OF AN ANTI-AUTHORITARIAN PEOPLE: NATIVE AMERICANSFor the compliant, the U.S. government appears to be a force of good thatoccasionally errs, but what anti-­authoritarians sense—and some directlyexperience—is that the U.S. government and ruling elite are powerful forces ofviolence when their policies are resisted. This is no revelation for NativeAmericans.Tecumseh (1768–1813), Crazy Horse (1840–1877), Sitting Bull (1831–1890), as wellas many other famous and non-­famous Native Americans challenged and resistedthe authority of the U.S. government to defraud Native Americans from their landand to destroy their communities and their way of life. For their resistance,many Native Americans have suffered violent deaths. Tecumseh was killed inbattle; Crazy Horse was killed trying to escape incarceration; and Sitting Bullwas killed resisting arrest.The assault against Native Americans constitutes racism, genocide, and landtheft on a massive scale. It is also an attempt to eliminate a culturaltradition that—with its relative absence of coercion and greaterfreedoms—undermines U.S. authoritarians.At the time Europeans began to colonize North America, Native American societieswere highly diverse with many different political systems and various religiousbeliefs. However, they did share certain common characteristics. Nativesocieties in what now constitutes the United States did not have thehierarchical and authoritarian organization of the Aztec and Inca societiessouth of them. In what now constitutes the United States, historian Eric Fonernotes, “Many Europeans saw Indians as embodying freedom.” He reported that aEuropean religious missionary during that time said about Native Americans:“They are born, live, and die in a liberty without restraint.” Foner also quotesan early trader who observed that Indians had no words to express “despoticpower, arbitrary kings, oppressed or obedient subjects.”European colonizers came from extremely hierarchical societies, ruled by kingsand aristocracies; and within families, husbands ruled their wives. Uponmarriage, a European woman surrendered her legal identity, which meant she couldnot own property or sign contracts, or, except in rare circumstances, get adivorce. By contrast, in most Native societies, women could divorce theirhusbands and choose premarital partners. And while tribal leaders were mostlymen, female elders would help select male leaders and take part in tribalmeetings. Thus, for European colonizing men, their absolute power within theirmarriage was threatened to the extent that their wives were aware of NativeAmerican life. In general, the relative attractiveness of Native Americansocieties was threatening for authoritarians.A common characteristic of Native American societies is an absence of impersonalauthority and coercion. Ensuring civility is seen as a collectiveresponsibility. When interpersonal conflicts arise, the emphasis is onnegotiations among parties and kin groups to settle conflicts. A commoncharacteristic of Native societies is to make all efforts toward members notexperiencing coercion and resulting resentments. If consensus could not beachieved, bands would splinter off.The Iroquois (who call themselves the Haudenosaunee) are a confederation ofnortheastern tribes in North America, and Foner notes that one colonial officialstated that the Iroquois held “such absolute notions of liberty that they allowof no kind of superiority of one over another, and banish all servitude fromtheir territories.” Historian Gary Nash documents the anti-authoritarian natureof Iroquoian culture, including their child-rearing. Iroquois youngsters, Nashreports, “were being prepared to enter an adult society which was nothierarchical, as in the European case, but where individuals lived on a moreequalitarian basis, with power more evenly distributed among men and women orold and young than in European society. . . . One aspect of child-rearing onwhich Europeans and Iroquoian cultures differed was in the attitude towardauthority. In Iroquois society the autonomous individual, loyal to the group butindependent and aloof rather than submissive, was the ideal.”Native American societies are not leaderless societies but leadership is basedon consensus about a leader’s wisdom. Thus, if a hunter leader, medicine leader,or warrior leader makes repeated errors that threaten their people’s well-being,this likely would result in a new consensus and new leadership. The flight ofthe Nez Perce from U.S. government troops illustrates this.In 1877, after a series of land concessions followed by broken promises by theU.S. government, a group among the Nez Perce were not willing to again trust theU.S. government’s latest and even smaller land promises. This group of Nez Percerefused to submit and surrender, and they outmaneuvered a U.S. military forcefor more than three months, over approximately 1,800 miles from their homelandin what is now eastern Oregon through Montana. While standard history textbooksroutinely credit Chief Joseph as the chief of the Nez Perce and recount hisfinal painful surrender, historian Kent Nerburn documents that there were otherleaders who actually directed the flight. Looking Glass initially led the groupbut was challenged for moving too slowly; and when the U.S. Army surprised theNez Perce at the Battle of the Big Hole, tribal consensus replaced Looking Glasswith Poker Joe (though later Looking Glass regained his leadership position).And when Joseph believed that surrender was necessary to save Nez Perce lives,several Nez Perce chose to follow another leader, White Bird, and continue tohead to Canada; and the consensus was not only to accept that group’s decisionbut to aid White Bird and his group’s escape.The enormity of the assault on Native Americans can only partially be capturedby statistics. Conservative estimates of the 1492 indigenous population withinwhat are now the borders of the United States are, according to Foner, betweentwo and five million people; but historian Ward Churchill estimates the numbercloser to twelve million. There is little controversy among historians that by1900, the Native American population in what now forms the United States haddeclined to approximately 250,000.This decimation of Native Americans occurred through a variety of methods. Thesemethods included army campaigns and massacres (famously, but not limited to,Sand Creek, Washita River, and Wounded Knee). Native American decimation alsooccurred because of forced removals, including most famously the “Trail ofTears,” in which approximately 55% of all Cherokees died during or as animmediate result of their forced removal by the U.S. government. Also in Texas,Churchill points out, “an official bounty on native scalps—any native scalps—wasmaintained until well into the 1870s. The result was that the indigenouspopulation of this state, once the densest in all of North America, had beenreduced to near zero by 1880.”Another extremely effective genocidal method was starvation. In “Genocide byOther Means: U.S. Army Slaughtered Buffalo in Plains Indian Wars,” journalistAdrian Jawort documents U.S. government policy to destroy indigenous food supplyto drive them off their land. “During the Plains Indian Wars,” Jawort reports,“as the U.S. Army attempted to drive Indians off the Plains and intoreservations, the Army had little success because the warriors could live offthe land and elude them—wherever the buffalo flourished, the Indiansflourished.” Jawort describes how William Tecumseh Sherman, who had foundsuccess with a “scorched earth” policy against the Confederacy during the CivilWar, repeated the same strategy with Native Americans and their buffalo. Jawortalso quotes anthropologist S. Neyooxet Greymorning and historian Andrew Isenbergin this regard. Greymorning points out, “The government realized that as long asthis food source was there, as long as this key cultural element was there, itwould have difficulty getting Indians onto reservations.” Isenberg notes, “SomeArmy officers in the Great Plains in the late 1860s and 1870s, including WilliamSherman and Richard Dodge, as well as the Secretary of the Interior in the1870s, Columbus Delano, foresaw that if the bison were extinct, the Indians inthe Great Plains would have to surrender to the reservation system.”The 1948 United Nations Convention on Genocide states: “Genocide means any ofthe following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, anational, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) Killing members ofthe group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of thegroup; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated tobring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measuresintended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring childrenof the group to another group.” While a single component suffices for the UNdefinition of genocide, the U.S. government’s genocide of Native Americansincludes all of these components.The Native American population has also been reduced by forced sterilization—andrecently so. Physician Gregory Rutecki, in “Forced Sterilization of NativeAmericans: Late Twentieth Century Physician Cooperation with National EugenicPolicies,” documents, “Independent research estimated that as many as 25–50% ofNative American women were sterilized between 1970 and 1976.” Psychologist DavidWalker details American psychologists’ use of pseudoscientific psychometrics,including IQ testing, to attempt to establish the inferiority of indigenousAmericans so as to justify sterilization.Churchill also notes that “the massive compulsory transfer of American Indianchildren from their families, communities, and societies to Euro-Americanfamilies and institutions.” This compulsory transfer has occurred through,Churchill points out, “such mechanisms as the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs(BIA) boarding school system, and a pervasive policy of placing Indian childrenfor adoption . . . with non-­Indians. . . such circumstances have been visitedupon more than three-quarters of indigenous youth in some generations after1900.” The stated goal of such policies, Churchill notes, has been“assimilation” of Native people into U.S. values and belief systems, and “theobjective has been to bring about the disappearance of indigenous societies assuch.”Though Native resistance has continued, when resistance feels impossible, as itdoes for many indigenous Americans today, this results in a high rate ofsuicide, especially among young Native Americans. Psychologist Roland Chrisjohnand co-­author Shaunessy McKay, in Dying to Please You, point out that just aswith the extraordinarily high suicide rate by Jews in Nazi concentration camps,a high rate of self-inflicted deaths by any overwhelmingly oppressed national,ethnical, racial, or religious group is essentially another form of genocide.Attorney Peter d’Errico in “Native American Genocide or Holocaust?” (2017)describes how U.S. government and society avoid the reality that genocide hasoccurred in part because of “the tenderness of American egos” and the“fallacious notion of ‘American exceptionalism.’” The U.S. government’s 2009“Apology to Native Peoples of the United States,” unsurprisingly, excludes anymention of genocide, and it includes the following: “DISCLAIMER—Nothing in thissection authorizes or supports any claim against the United States.” Moreover,this “apology” was buried in a Department of Defense Appropriations Act H.R.3326-2 and signed by then-president Obama in a ceremony closed to the press.Thus, d’Errico concludes, “The result was more an effort to bury the past, thanto confront it.”"},{"pageContent":"6: PSYCHIATRIC ASSAULT AND MARGINALIZATION: NOT JUST FRANCES FARMER“For guardians of the status quo, there is nothing genuinely or fundamentallywrong with the prevailing order and its dominant institutions, which are viewedas just. Therefore, anyone claiming otherwise—especially someone sufficientlymotivated by that belief to take radical action—must, by definition, beemotionally unstable and psychologically disabled. Put another way, there are,broadly speaking, two choices: obedience to institutional authority or radicaldissent from it. The first is a sane and valid choice only if the second iscrazy and illegitimate. . . . Radical dissent is evidence, even proof, of asevere personality disorder.”—Glenn Greenwald, No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S.Surveillance State, 2014The use of psychiatric diagnoses to discredit, dismiss, and ­marginalize famousand non-famous anti-authoritarians is common.Earlier I discussed how several mainstream media ­journalists, attempting todiscredit whistleblower Edward Snowden, psycho­pathologized him with labels suchas “grandiose narcissist.” Attorney and journalist Glenn Greenwald alsodocuments the mainstream media’s psychopathologizing of other recentwhistle­blowers, including WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and Chelsea Manning.The mainstream media has depicted Assange as bizarre and paranoid, the New YorkTimes labeling him with “erratic and imperious behavior” and “delusionalgrandeur.” The mainstream media also promoted a view that Manning was motivatednot by her moral convictions but gender struggles, anti-gay bullying, andconflict with her father resulting in personality disorders.Ralph Nader, as noted, for challenging the corporatism of both the Democraticand Republican parties and running for president, was described by a columnistfor the Nation as “a very deluded man . . . . a psychologically troubled man.”Malcolm X, for his distrust of authorities, was diagnosed by FBI profilers with“pre-psychotic paranoid schizophrenia.”The anti-authoritarian actions of both Thomas Paine and Eugene Debs wereattributed to “dipsomania” and other terms for alcoholism. Debs biographer RayGinger notes that during the 1894 Pullman Strike, the New York Times published asmearing by the physician Thomas Robertson, who falsely claimed to have treatedDebs for dipsomania; with the Times quoting Robertson as saying, “Those who knewDebs well . . . believe that his present conduct is in large measure, if notwholly, due to the disordered condition of his mind and body, brought about bythe liquor habit.”The practice of psychopatholozing anti-authoritarians so as to discredit andmarginalize them is certainly not exclusive to the United States. In the SovietUnion, political dissidents were routinely psychiatrically hospitalized anddrugged; and today, Chinese dissidents continue to be diagnosed with mentalillness and forcibly treated.In the United States, the practice of psychopathologizing anti-authoritariansbegan at the very beginning of the nation. Benjamin Rush, as noted, was a friendof Thomas Paine in pre-Revolutionary War Philadelphia, but then shunned Paineafter The Age of Reason. Today, Benjamin Rush is well-known among psychiatristsas “the father of American psychiatry,” as his image adorns the seal of theAmerican Psychiatric Association. In addition to Rush’s abandonment of ThomasPaine, he also attempted to gain favor with the new ruling class in the UnitedStates another way. In 1805, Rush diagnosed those rebelling against the newlycentralized federal authority as having an “excess of the passion for liberty”that “constituted a form of insanity,” which he labeled as the disease ofanarchia.In 1851, Louisiana physician Dr. Samuel Cartwright reported his discovery ofdrapetomania, the disease that caused slaves to flee captivity. Cartwrightbelieved that absent of this illness slaves were “like children . . .constrained by unalterable physiological laws to love those in authority overthem.” Cartwright also reported his discovery of dysesthesia, a disease thatcaused slaves to pay insufficient attention to their jobs, “breaking the toolshe works with, and spoiling everything he touches,” as well as being resistantto punishment and not feeling the “pain of any consequences.”In 1958, when civil rights activist Clennon W. King Jr. attempted to enroll atthe all-white University of Mississippi, the Mississippi police arrested him onthe grounds that “any nigger who tried to enter Ole Miss must be crazy.”Following his arrest, historian David Oshinsky reports, he was then taken to thecounty courthouse where a “lunacy warrant” was issued on him, and he wasconfined to a mental hospital for twelve days, and only declared “competent”when he promised to leave Mississippi. In The Protest Psychosis: HowSchizophrenia Became a Black Disease (2010), psychiatrist and sociologistJonathan Metzl details systemic racism that labels “threats to authority asmental illness,” and how this process increases the likelihood that black menwill get diagnosed with schizophrenia.A belief that one is being surveilled has sometimes been enough “evidence” foranti-authoritarians to be assessed as delusionally paranoid. Recall how whenRalph Nader was being followed by General Motors detectives, he sensed it andtold others, and sounded like he was delusional. Nader, however, was lucky thatdetectives were incompetent and got caught. However, Ernest Hemingway was not solucky.By 1960, Hemingway was labeled delusionally paranoid about FBI surveillance. Hisfriend and biographer A. E. Hotchner recounted Hemingway saying: “The feds . . .It’s the worst hell. The goddamnedest hell. They’ve bugged everything. . . .Everything’s bugged. Can’t use the phone. Mail intercepted.”Long after Hemingway’s death, the FBI released his file in response to a Freedomof Information petition, and Hotchner reported: “It revealed that beginning inthe 1940s J. Edgar Hoover had placed Ernest under surveillance because he wassuspicious of Ernest’s activities in Cuba. Over the following years, agentsfiled reports on him and tapped his phones. The surveillance continued allthrough his confinement at St. Mary’s Hospital. It is likely that the phoneoutside his room was tapped after all. In the years since, I have tried toreconcile Ernest’s fear of the FBI, which I regretfully misjudged, with thereality of the FBI file. I now believe he truly sensed the surveillance, andthat it substantially contributed to his anguish and his suicide.”Hemingway was treated with electroshock (ECT) as many as 15 times in December1960, then in January 1961, he was “released in ruins,” according to anotherHemingway biographer, Jeffrey Meyers. Hotchner reported that Hemingway’s loss ofmemory caused by the ECT made him even more depressed and hopeless, as Hemingwayhad stated, “Well, what is the sense of ruining my head and erasing my memory,which is my capital, and putting me out of business?” In July 1961, shortlybefore his 62nd birthday and soon after Hemingway had been given still anotherseries of shock treatments, he committed suicide.Anti-authoritarians’ intense reactions to insults and injustices can providejustification for authorities to psychopathologize them. A young Emma Goldmanwas lucky to live in an era in which she was not pathologized after she threw apitcher of water at the face of a woman who was happy with the 1887 execution ofthe Haymarket martyrs, but other anti-authoritarians have not been so lucky andtheir strong reactions to insults and injustices have often beenpsychopathologized. This is especially true for intense reactions by women, oneof the more well-known examples being actress Frances Farmer (1913–1970),brought to public attention in the 1982 movie Frances, starring Jessica Lange.Farmer revealed her anti-authoritarian streak as a senior in high school whenshe won a writing contest with a controversial essay, “God Dies,” and then againas a young woman when, in 1935, she accepted a newspaper prize for a trip to theSoviet Union over her mother’s strong objections. Farmer was stunninglybeautiful but rebelled against studio casting based solely on her looks. Shealso resisted the studio’s attempt to control her private life, and she refusedto attend Hollywood parties. Farmer aspired to be a serious actress, and shetook time off from movie work to appear in a Clifford Odets stage production ofone of his plays.Farmer, feeling oppressed by Hollywood authorities and betrayed by men she hadtrusted, began abusing alcohol. In 1942, she was stopped by the police fordriving with her headlights on bright in the wartime blackout zone. She wasjailed and fined; and after she hadn’t paid her entire fine, the police trackedher down and entered her hotel room without permission. Then, as journalist MattEvans recounts, “Frances, who’d been sleeping in the nude, face down on the bed,under the influence of alcohol and somnifacient—at noon!—reacted as anyone wouldhave.” She became belligerent with the police when they arrested her. And then,after she was sentenced to 180 days in Los Angeles County jail, she becamephysically aggressive in the courtroom and was forced into a straitjacket.“If Frances had been left alone to serve her 180 days in jail,” Evans concluded,“it’s quite likely that, eventually, she would have sorted herself out.”Instead, family members and others from the movie industry successfully lobbiedthe judge to send her to the Kimball Sanitarium, her first institutionalization.Then in 1944, Frances’s mother committed Frances to Western State MentalHospital, where she was recommitted two additional times.“Frances was institutionalized,” Evans concludes, “not because she was insanebut because she’d been legally vulnerable. Because her dad, Ernest, was alawyer. Because her mother, Lillian, despite whatever unconscious animus mayhave lain in her heart, may have thought in her desperation and exasperationthat institutionalization was the last viable recourse to help her daughterheal. Heal? And become submissive and obedient.”In recent decades, children and adolescents in the United States who are notsubmissive and are disobedient have been increasingly psychopathologized.Several of the famous anti-­authoritarians profiled in this book, if childrentoday, would likely have been labeled with at least one psychiatric disorder.Malcolm X’s childhood, as noted, was replete with trauma including his familybreakup and then foster homes, resulting in his rebelling and engaging in theft.Today, a teenage Malcolm X would likely be labeled with the “disruptivedisorder” diagnosis called “conduct disorder” (CD) for criminally disruptivebehaviors. And owing especially to the fact of being in foster care, he wouldvery likely be prescribed psychiatric drugs, including antipsychotic drugs.Several other anti-authoritarians profiled in this book, including Eugene Debs,Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, and Jane Jacobs quit school or didn’t take itseriously. Today, for such obviously intelligent kids, this contempt for schoolwould make them highly vulnerable to a psychiatric diagnosis.Beginning in 1980, for noncompliant children who are not engaged in any illegalpractices, the APA (in its DSM-III diagnostic manual) created the disruptivedisorder diagnosis “oppositional defiant disorder” (ODD). For an ODD diagnosis,a youngster needs only four of the following eight symptoms for six months:often loses temper; often touchy or easily annoyed; often angry and resentful;often argues with authority figures; often actively defies or refuses to complywith requests from authority figures or with rules; often deliberately annoysothers; often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior; spitefulnessor vindictiveness at least twice within the past six months.In 2012, the Archives of General Psychiatry reported that between 1993 through2009, there was a sevenfold increase of children 13 years and younger beingprescribed antipsychotic drugs, and that disruptive behavior disorders such asODD and CD were the most common diagnoses in children medicated withantipsychotics, accounting for 63% of those medicated.“Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder” (ADHD) is another common diagnosisfor children labeled with “behavior problems.” The “symptoms” of ADHD areinattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. While CD and ODD behaviors areovert rebellions, ADHD behaviors can in some instances be passive-aggressiverebellions. ADHD parallels Samuel Cartwright’s dysesthesia; while ODD and CDparallels Cartwright’s drapetomania.Alienated anti-authoritarian adults are often diagnosed with anxiety anddepression. Often a major pain of their lives that fuels their anxiety and/ordepression is fear that noncompliance with illegitimate authorities will causethem to be financially and socially marginalized; but they fear that compliancewith such illegitimate authorities will result in humiliation and loss ofintegrity. All this can result in anxiety and depression—created not bybiochemical defects but by existential realities.While only a small number of people diagnosed with bipolar disorder,schizophrenia, and other psychoses identify themselves as anarchists, myexperience is that a far higher percentage of this population as compared to thegeneral population have anarchist politics and values (such as resentingcoercion; distrusting impersonal authorities; believing people should organizeamong themselves rather than submit to authorities; and a willingness to riskpunishments to gain freedom from coercions).Among the people I have talked with who have been previously diagnosed withpsychiatric illnesses, I am struck by how many of them, compared to the generalpopulation, are essentially anti-authoritarians. Unluckily for them, theprofessionals who have diagnosed them are not.Historically, doctors have embraced authoritarianism at a higher percentage thanthe general population. In 2012, physician Alessandra Colaianni reported inJournal of Medical Ethics, “More than 7% of all German physicians became membersof the Nazi SS during World War II, compared with less than 1% of the generalpopulation. . . . Physicians joined the Nazi party and the killing operationsnot at gunpoint, not by force, but of their own volition.” Colaianni offersseveral reasons for this, one being doctors’ socialization to hierarchy andauthoritarianism: “Medical culture is, in many ways, a rigid hierarchy. . . .Those at the lower end of the hierarchy are used to doing what their superiorsask of them, often without understanding exactly why. . . . Questioningsuperiors is often uncomfortable, for fear both of negative consequences(retaliation, losing the superior’s respect) and of being wrong.”MDs and PhDs have received extensive schooling and thus have lived for manyyears in a world where one routinely complies with the demands of authorities.Thus, people who reject this compliance appear to be “abnormal” for many MDs andPhDs. My experience is that most psychologists, psychiatrists, and other mentalhealth professionals are unaware of the magnitude of their obedience, and so theanti-authoritarianism of their patients can create enormous anxiety for them—andthis anxiety fuels diagnoses and treatments.A handful of mental health professionals have challenged the legitimacy ofmental health authorities—and have paid a price for so doing. In 1968,psychiatrist Loren Mosher (1933–2004) became the National Institute of MentalHealth’s chief of the Center for Schizophrenia Research. In 1971, Mosherlaunched an alternative approach for people diagnosed with schizophrenia,opening the first Soteria House in Santa Clara, California. Soteria House was anegalitarian and non-coercive psychosocial milieu employing nonprofessionalcaregivers. The results showed that people do far better with this Soteriaapproach than with standard psychiatric treatment, and that people can in factrecover with little or no use of antipsychotic drugs. Mosher’s successembarrassed establishment psychiatry and displeased the pharmaceutical industry.Not surprisingly, the National Institute of Mental Health choked off SoteriaHouse funding, and Mosher was fired from his NIMH position in 1980.There continues to be a movement of dissident mental health professionals andex-patient activists. This movement attempts to get the word out on the lack ofscience behind the DSM diagnostic bible, and to expose the illegitimacy ofbiochemical disease explanations such as the “chemical-imbalance” theory.Recently, even some members of mainstream psychiatry have been forced to admitfailure in these areas.In response to the DSM-5, published in 2013, the NIMH director, citing the lackof scientific validity of the DSM, stated that the “NIMH will be re-orientingits research away from DSM categories.” Also harshly critical of the DSM-5 wasthe politically astute former chair of the DSM-IV task force, psychiatrist AllenFrances, who published Saving Normal (2014), which mocked several new DSM-5mental illness inventions, especially the pathologizing of normal human grief.Frances’s repudiation of DSM-5 is noteworthy, as it is as if the guy who wroteLeviticus realized that his “abominating” and “sinning” had gotten out of hand.Similar to their abandonment of the DSM, establishment psychiatrists have alsorecently fled psychiatry’s long promulgated “chemical imbalance theory of mentalillness.” In the late 1980s, psychiatry authorities and giant pharmaceuticalcompanies began telling the general public—despite lacking scientificevidence—that depression is caused by a “chemical imbalance” of low-levels ofserotonin that could be treated with “chemically balancing” antidepressants,such as Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs). The idea that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance that couldbe corrected with SSRI antidepressants was made to sound like taking insulin fordiabetes, and so the use of these SSRIs skyrocketed. Today, the falseness ofthis chemical-imbalance theory of mental illness is not controversial.In 2011, leading establishment psychiatrist Ronald Pies, ­editor-in-chiefemeritus of Psychiatric Times, stated, “In truth, the ‘chemical imbalance’notion was always a kind of urban legend—never a theory seriously propounded bywell-informed psychiatrists.” After National Public Radio correspondent AlixSpiegel learned that the chemical imbalance theory was untrue, she thendiscovered establishment authorities’ justifications for promulgating it. Onesuch rationalization was that by framing depression as a chemical deficiency,patients felt more comfortable taking antidepressant drugs. While somepsychiatrists view the chemical imbalance theory as a well-meaning “white lie,”my experience is that many physicians continue to be ignorant of the truth. Thebottom line is that no matter what the reason, mainstream psychiatrists who havepromulgated untruths have broken their patients’ trust.Does psychiatry retain any legitimate authority? In a 2014 Truthout interview,Robert Whitaker, medical reporter and author of Anatomy of an Epidemic: MagicBullets, Psychiatric Drugs, and the Astonishing Rise of Mental Illness inAmerica (2010), stated about psychiatry, “We see that its diagnostics are beingdismissed as invalid; its research has failed to identify the biology of mentaldisorders to validate its diagnostics; and its drug treatments are increasinglybeing seen as not very effective or even harmful. That is the story of aprofession that has reason to feel insecure about its place in the marketplace.”Despite its scientific failure, psychiatry has retained societal authority. Itsauthority rests on three pillars.First, by pushing drug treatments, it meets the financial needs of drugcompanies, and so it has large financial backing from Big Pharma. In 2008,congressional investigations of psychiatry revealed that the APA and several“thought leader” psychiatrists received significant amounts of money from drugcompanies. Big Pharma heavily funds university psychiatry departments, sponsorsconferences and continuing education for psychiatrists, and pays well-knownclinicians and researchers to be speakers and consultants. In 2012, PLOSMedicine reported, “69% of the DSM-5 task force members report having ties tothe pharmaceutical industry.”Second, by pathologizing and thus depoliticizing malaise, psychiatry helpsmaintain the status quo, meeting the needs of the ruling power structure.Historically, professionals such as police and clergy have been utilized tocontrol populations. More recently, mental health professionals have also beenused. One example of this is mainstream mental health professional’s explanationfor high rates of suicide among indigenous peoples, detailed by psychologistRoland Chrisjohn and Shaunessy McKay in Dying to Please You: “Existingexplanations blame the victim, finding that they suffer from personal adjustmentproblems or emotional deficiencies like ‘low self-esteem’ and ‘depression.’ Noneof the existing explanations alleviate the situation by acting or suggestingaction against the forces of oppression; they don’t even recognize them.”Meeting the needs of the power structure ensures an institution’s existence. Andso the professions of psychiatry and psychology have had reason to want to beutilized to subvert resistance by U.S. soldiers via psychiatric drug“treatments” and behavioral manipulations. According to the Military Times in2013, one in six U.S. armed service members were taking at least one psychiatricdrug, many of these medicated soldiers in combat zones. And in 2009, the NewYork Times reported how Martin Seligman, a former president of the AmericanPsychological Association, consulted with the U.S. Army’s Comprehensive SoldierFitness positive psychology program. In this program, in one role-play, asergeant is asked to take his exhausted men on one more difficult mission, andthe sergeant is initially angry and complains that “it’s not fair”; but in therole-play, his “rehabilitation” involves reinterpreting the order as acompliment.A third pillar of psychiatry’s societal authority is its coercions to controlpeople who create societal tension but who have done nothing illegal. Mentalhealth professionals meet the control needs of authoritarians in charge ofsociety but also meet the control needs of authoritarian subordinates. “Thiscoercive function is what society and most people actually appreciate most aboutpsychiatry,” concludes David Cohen, professor of social welfare, in his 2014article, “It’s the Coercion, Stupid!” Cohen explains the societal need forpsychiatry’s “extra-legal police function” compels society to be blind topsychiatry’s complete lack of scientific validity, “Because of psychiatriccoercion, society gives psychiatric theories a free pass. These theories neverneed to pass any rigorously devised tests (as we expect other importantscientific theories to pass), they only need to be asserted.”In the history of American psychiatry, there have been several adult populationslacking political power—including Native Americans, women, and homosexuals—whohave been psychopathologized and marginalized for the “offense” of assertingtheir humanity. In the 1970s, homosexuals were able to gain some political powerand fought so as to no longer be at the mercy of the APA. In 1970, the GayLiberation Front (GLF) infiltrated a conference of the APA where a film wasdemonstrating the use of electroshock treatment to decrease same-sex attraction.GLF members shouted “Torture!” and seized the microphone to rebukepsychiatrists. Using multiple political strategies and tactics, gay activistseffectively forced the APA to stop pathologizing homosexuality as a mentalillness in 1973. While organized adults have successfully liberated themselvesfrom being psychopathologized and marginalized, mental health authorities haveincreasingly zeroed in on a politically powerless population: anti-authoritarianyouth.Many young people labeled with psychiatric diagnoses are essentiallyanti-authoritarians who are pained and angered by coercion, unnecessary rules,and illegitimate authority. When young anti-authoritarians are labeled with apsychiatric ­diagnosis, they get ensnared in an authoritarian trap. Resistanceto diagnosis and treatment often results in professionals labeling young rebelsas “noncompliant with treatment,” increasing the severity of the diagnosis, andincreasing the dosage of tranquilizing medications. All this can be enraging foryoung people, sometimes so much so it makes them appear not just angry butcrazy.Today, a potentially huge army of young anti-authoritarians are beingdepoliticized by mental illness diagnoses and by attributions that theirinattention, anxiety, depression, and disruptiveness are caused by defectivebiochemistry—and not by their alienation from a dehumanizing society and theirresistance to illegitimate authorities."},{"pageContent":"7: SCHOOLING’S ASSAULT ON YOUNG ANTI-AUTHORITARIANS“The institutional role of the schools for the most part is just to train peoplefor obedience and conformity, and to make them controllable andindoctrinated—and as long as the schools fulfill that role, they’ll besupported.”—Noam Chomsky, Understanding Power:The Indispensable Chomsky, 2002“There’s a reason education sucks, and it’s the same reason it will never,ever, ever be fixed. . . . Because the owners, the owners of this country don’twant that. . . . They don’t want well-informed, well-educated people capable ofcritical thinking. . . .You know what they want? They want obedient workers. . .. People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork. Andjust dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shitty jobs.”—George Carlin, “The American Dream” from Life is Worth Losing, 2006“When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school, it’s a wonder I canthink at all.”—Paul Simon, “Kodachrome,” 1973As a young child in school, before I understood the words authoritarian ordehumanizing, I thought there was something terribly wrong with a place where Ihad to raise my hand to go the bathroom. I recall thinking that I was lucky thatI wasn’t shy, because if I had been too shy to ask for permission, then I mightwet my pants. Having to ask permission to go the bathroom was bad enough, butthere were teachers who made us either say—or show with our fingers—whether weneeded to urinate (one finger) or defecate (two fingers). I remember thinkingthis must be especially horrific for prim-and-proper girls, and I thought thatthese teachers must be perverts to demand that.Nowadays, many kids tell me that they still must get permission from a teacherto leave their classroom to relieve themselves. Recently, a high school studenttold me that, in his school, students get a limited number of restroom passesper semester. I asked him what happens if a student runs out of passes and hasto take a shit—do they expect students to just shit in their pants? He laughed.Then I told him that I was serious—what do they expect you to do? Then he gotserious and said, “So much of school is fucked up, we never really think abouteach fucked up thing.”Social psychologist Stanley Milgram in Obedience to Authority, after reportingon his studies showing a frightening compliance to abusive illegitimateauthority, attempted to understand the reasons: “As soon as the child emergesfrom the cocoon of family, he is transferred to an institutional system ofauthority, the school,” where the student learns that “deference is the onlyappropriate and comfortable response to authority.” Standard schools not onlydemand our compliance to authority regardless of our assessment of itslegitimacy, they require our compliance with impersonal authorities. Milgramnotes that “the modern industrial world forces individuals to submit toimpersonal authorities, so that responses are made to abstract rank, indicatedby an insignia, uniform or title.” In other words, badges.In their 1962 book Cradles of Eminence, psychologist Victor Goertzel andeducator Mildred Goertzel examined the childhood of 400 eminent people, and theyreported that the majority of them disliked school immensely.The Goertzels detailed the pain that the anti-authoritarian Albert Einstein hadwith his schooling. When Einstein was a teenager, he found school sointolerable, he asked the school doctor to give him a certificate saying that hehad a nervous breakdown so that he did not have to attend (a tactic thatworked). Einstein later concluded about schooling: “It is, in fact, nothingshort of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirelystrangled the holy curiosity of inquiry. . . . It is a very grave mistake tothink that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means ofcoercion and a sense of duty.”One of Einstein’s biographers, Ronald Clark, tells us that young Albert didn’tpay attention to his teachers and failed his college entrance examination twice.Einstein recalls hating authoritarian discipline in his schools: “The teachersin the elementary school appeared to me like sergeants and in the Gymnasium theteachers were like lieutenants.” After Einstein finally did enter college, oneprofessor told him, “You have one fault; one can’t tell you anything.” Today, ayoung Albert Einstein would very likely receive an ADHD diagnosis and maybe anODD one as well. The very characteristics of Einstein that upsetauthorities—questioning and challenging illegitimate authority—are thecharacteristics most required to be a great scientist.The primary method of “motivation” in standard schools is coercion throughgrades. Students focus on what they need to memorize for a good grade, and theystop asking their own questions and pursuing answers to them. As dissidenteducator John Holt noted, “To a very great degree, school is a place wherechildren learn to be stupid. . . Children come to school curious; within a fewyears most of that curiosity is dead, or at least silent.” The motivationalmethod of coercion not only subverts curiosity, it prevents students from evenretaining facts. “You did your homework,” Noam Chomsky reminds us, “you passedthe exam, maybe you even got an ‘A’—and a week later you couldn’t even rememberwhat the course was about.”Standard school coercions subvert a love of reading. A report released by CommonSense Media in 2014 stated: “The proportion of children who are daily readersdrops markedly from childhood to the tween and teenage years. One study(Scholastic, 2013) documents a drop from 48% of six- to eight-year-olds down to24% of 15- to 17-year-olds who are daily readers, and another (National Centerfor Educational Statistics, 2013) shows a drop from 53% of nine-year-olds to 19%of 17-year-olds.”What turns most teenagers off from reading for pleasure is compulsory reading ofbooks that they have no intrinsic interest in. I recall one teenager who hadloved to read as a kid but became turned off to reading because of requiredreading. I joked with him that if schools one day made kids have compulsory sexwith people they weren’t interested in that this would turn kids off from sex ingeneral. He thought about this for a few seconds, then told me that adults wouldprobably do just that if they realized how making something compulsory turnskids off from it.What are the origins of the U.S. mass educational system? Chomsky points out,“In the late 19th century it was largely designed to turn independent farmersinto disciplined factory workers, and a good deal of education maintains thatform.” Chomsky also concluded that those at the top of the societal hierarchysupport the educational system because they believe: “People are supposed to bepassive and apathetic and doing what they’re told by the responsible people whoare in control. That’s elite ideology across the political spectrum—fromliberals to Leninists, it’s essentially the same ideology: people are too stupidand ignorant to do things by themselves so for their own benefit we have tocontrol them.”As Americans have received increasingly more schooling, they have become lesscapable of effectively challenging the ruling class. In 1900, only 6% ofAmericans graduated high school, and a college education was rare for ordinaryAmericans; today, approximately 85% of Americans graduate high school, andcollege is increasingly expected for all. However, in the 1880s and 1890s,American farmers with little or no schooling created a Populist movement;organized America’s largest-scale working people’s cooperative; formed aPeople’s Party that received 8% of the vote in 1892 presidential election;designed a “subtreasury” plan (that had it been implemented would have allowedeasier credit for farmers and broken the power of large banks) and sent 40,000lecturers across the United States to articulate this plan; and evidenced allkinds of sophisticated political ideas, strategies, and tactics absent todayfrom America’s well-schooled population.There are anti-authoritarian educators who have the courage to publicly assertthe authoritarian nature of standard schools. John Taylor Gatto, accepting theNew York City Teacher of the Year Award, January 31, 1990, stated: “The truth isthat schools don’t really teach anything except how to obey orders. This is agreat mystery to me because thousands of humane, caring people work in schoolsas teachers and aides and administrators, but the abstract logic of theinstitution overwhelms their individual contributions.”Standard school teaches compliance with hierarchy; obedience to authorities forwhom one does not necessarily respect; and regurgitation of meaningless materialfor a high grade. The standard classroom socializes students to be passive; tobe directed by others; to take seriously the rewards and punishments ofauthorities; to pretend to care about things that they don’t care about; andthat one is impotent to change one’s dissatisfying situation.In a hierarchical society, prestigious schools confer prestigious badges.Dissident educator Jonathan Kozol was a student at an elite prep school and thenat Harvard. Kozol concluded, “Children come to realize, early in their schoolcareers, the terrible danger to their own success in statements that give voiceto strong intensities.” Kozol recounted how he was taught to obey orders and “tochannel our dissent into innocuous patterns of polite ‘discussion andinvestigation.’” Kozol explains how schools, especially elitist institutions,teach what he called an inert concern—that “caring” in and of itself is“ethical” but that disobedience is immature.Recall Ralph Nader’s contempt for Harvard Law School, which he saw as narrowingminds and producing lawyers to serve corporations. And with respect to all hisstandard schooling, Nader observed, “With the exceptions of some marvelousteachers, our many hours in class teach us to believe, not to think, to obey,not to challenge.”Noam Chomsky was named to the Society of Fellows at Harvard in 1951, and laterhe reflected on the difference between Harvard and Oxford, “We only had a phonysuperficiality, while they had a genuine superficiality.” In looking back at hisstudent years, Chomsky recounted that “most of the people who make it throughthe educational system and get into the elite universities are able to do itbecause they’ve been willing to obey a lot of stupid orders for years andyears—that’s the way I did it, for example. Like you’re told by some stupidteacher, ‘Do this,’ which you know makes no sense whatsoever, but you do it, andif you do it you get to the next rung, and then you obey the next order, andfinally you work your way through and they give you your letters: an awful lotof education is like that. . . . Some people go along with it because theyfigure, ‘Okay, I’ll do any stupid thing that asshole says because I want to getahead’; others do it because they’ve just internalized the values. . . . But youdo it, or else you’re out: you ask too many questions and you’re going to get introuble. Now, there are also people who don’t go along—and they’re called‘behavior problems,’ or ‘unmotivated,’ or things like that.”Elitist schools and their conferred badges can provide liars and bullshitartists with great confidence in their ability to get away with lies andbullshit throughout their entire lives, and such projected confidence providesthem greater influence. Susan Cain in Quiet quotes the Harvard Business School(HBS) information session on how to be a good class participant: “Speak withconviction. Even if you believe something only fifty-five percent, say it as ifyou believe it a hundred percent.” Cain discovered that at HBS, “If a studenttalks often and forcefully, then he’s a player; if he doesn’t, he’s on themargins.” She observed that the men at HBS “look like people who expect to be incharge . . . . I have the feeling that if you asked one of them for drivingdirections, he’d greet you with a can-do smile and throw himself into the taskof helping you to your destination—whether or not he knew the way.”For authoritarians, a degree from Harvard Business School is a prestigious badgeof authority. For anti-authoritarians, an HBS degree is especially suspect, asthey know that HBS alumni include George W. Bush, 1975 graduate, in charge atthe advent of the 2008 financial meltdown, and Jeffrey Skilling, 1979 graduate,former CEO of Enron and convicted of securities fraud and insider trading.Business journalist Duff McDonald’s 2017 book about HBS, The Golden Passport,concludes that HBS teaches greed and socializes students to the idea that “ifeverybody assumes you’re a whore, you might as well grab as much money aspossible while you’re still in demand.”The more absolute the power of institutional authorities—be they in parochialschools, Native American residential boarding schools, or public schools—themore likely their physical and emotional abuse. Recall the excellent studentMalcolm X being told by his public school teacher that being a lawyer was “norealistic goal for a nigger” and the teacher-inflicted physical and emotionalabuse on Emma Goldman. I remember in junior high school, one kid raising hishand desiring to contribute to the class discussion but told by the teacher,“I’m not calling on you, you are in the crud group.” While certainly manyteachers try to be civil and kind, I can recall more than one teacher thinkingthemselves funny when they were being cruel. That’s why, for several decadesnow, young people continue to resonate to Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in theWall” and its lyrics about “dark sarcasm in the classroom.”While teachers today might well be fired for certain kinds of emotional andphysical abuse, standard schools are replete with acceptable psychologicalviolence. These schools force kids to compete against one another. The bettersome students do on an exam, the worse this is for others. School not onlypunishes most academic cooperation—it’s called cheating—school encouragesresentment for others’ success.Today, we hear much about peer bullying but little about what fuels thatcruelty. Human beings in institutions replete with coercions andhumiliations—whether these institutions are penitentiaries or schools—are oftengoing to take their pain out on others they perceive as weaker than they are.Similarly, the fuel for abusive parenting is also often a lifetime of coercionsand humiliations, including job and schooling ones.Working with teenagers for over three decades, my experience is that the sourceof their suicidal thoughts is actually more often located in the school than thefamily. And while occasionally the source of overwhelming pain is a singleabusive teacher or a bullying peer, often suicidality is fueled by the anxietyof being overwhelmed by bureaucratic coercions; for example, having failedclasses in subjects they have no interest in and being forced to go to summerschool or not graduate.With young people increasingly expected to attend college, a relatively newabuse is student-loan debt. Large debt—and the fear it creates—is a pacifyingforce. There was no tuition at Queens College, City University of New York, whenI attended in the 1970s, a time when tuition at many U.S. public universitieswas so affordable that it was easy to get an undergraduate and even a graduatedegree without accruing any student-loan debt. The Project on Student Debtreported, “Seven in 10 seniors (68%) who graduated from public and nonprofitcolleges in 2015 had student loan debt, with an average of $30,100 perborrower.” While that’s the average debt, I routinely talk to college graduatesand dropouts with far higher debt. During the time in one’s life when it shouldbe easiest to resist authority because one does not yet have familyresponsibilities, many young adults worry about the cost of bucking authority,losing their job, and being unable to pay an ever-increasing debt.Among the famous anti-authoritarians who I profile as well as among non-famousanti-authoritarians who I have known, schools and psychiatrichospitalization—sometimes even more than prison—can result in great anger. Fewanti-authoritarians report gaining anything of value in their coercive schoolingor psychiatric treatment, while some anti-authoritarians report gains from theirprison time (Malcolm X, Emma Goldman, Eugene Debs, and Alexander Berkman usedtheir prison time to educate themselves in a wide array of areas).When I began researching this book, I certainly was aware of the ill effects ofschooling on anti-authoritarians, but I underestimated their level of angertoward their schooling. Emma Goldman and Malcolm X, for example, recountedgreater anger with some of their teachers than with any prison officials. Onepattern I noticed—among this small sample of famous anti-­authoritarians who Iprofile as well as among the far larger sample of non-­famousanti-authoritarians who I have known—is that the more extensive their schooling,often the greater their anger. Among those with advanced degrees, there is angerabout having had to fight off schooling’s ill effects so as to acquire theirdegree-badges, and there is anger about their employment in academia."},{"pageContent":"PART THREE: TRAGEDY OR TRIUMPH"},{"pageContent":"8: LESSONS FROM ANTI-AUTHORITARIANS WHO HAVE HURT THEMSELVES, OTHERS, OR THECAUSESelf-Destructive Anti-Authoritarians: Phil Ochs, Lenny Bruce, and Ida Lupino;Violent Anti-Authoritarians: Alexander Berkman, Leon Czolgosz, and Ted KaczynskiAnti-authoritarians often cannot stop authoritarians from assaulting them, butsome anti-authoritarians compound this assault with a self-inflicted one.Overwhelmed by pain, there are many anti-authoritarians—famous andnon-famous—who have hurt themselves, hurt others, or hurt the cause of resistingillegitimate authority.Self-Destructive Anti-Authoritarians: Phil Ochs, Lenny Bruce,and Ida LupinoAmong anti-authoritarians who move into self-destructive behaviors, substanceabuse (with alcohol, illegal drugs, and psychiatric drugs) often plays a largerole. Anti-authoritarians, by their nature, do not take seriously authorities’admonitions, as they often see through hypocrisy; and U.S. authorities havehistorically manifested a great deal of hypocrisy around drugs (for example, therevolving door of psychiatric drugs becoming illegal ones, and vice versa).Anti-authoritarians’ disregard for alcohol and drug consequences may not, earlyon, be costly for them, and this can further diminish their caution and resultin a tragic irony: self-created dependency on a nonhuman illegitimateauthority—specifically, a chemical substance.Another common theme among self-destructive anti-­authoritarians is adeterioration toward self-absorption. An obsession with one’s moods can resultin feeling even more overwhelmed by pain, which fuels compulsive unwise actions.A sense of humor is vital for anti-authoritarian survival and joy, and, whenself-absorption displaces their sense of humor, anti-­authoritarians find itpainful to be with themselves—and so too do others, which, in a vicious cycle,makes anti-authoritarians even more self-loathing.A lack of self-care creates more pain and makes anti-­authoritarians morevulnerable to unwise actions. This lack of self-care can include a lack ofattention to physical health and personal finances, along with unwiserelationships with abusive and exploitative people. Relationships are critical.If an anti-­authoritarian lacks anyone they trust, they are highly vulnerable tounwise actions fueled by their pain. And if they trust untrustworthy people,that too can result in self-­destructive behaviors.Phil OchsIn the 1960s, singer-songwriter Phil Ochs (1940–1976) was sometimes described as“Tom Paine with a guitar.” Without regard for political correctness, both Paineand Ochs challenged illegitimate authorities and hypocrisy. Both achieved fameduring eras when anti-authoritarianism was fashionable, and both weremarginalized at the end of their lives when anti-authoritarianism fell out offashion. In 1976, at age 35, Ochs committed suicide, which came as no surpriseto his friends and family. In Ochs’s last years, he often talked about suicide,and it had been preceded by an array of self-destructive behaviors. However,triumph preceded tragedy for Phil Ochs, as it had for Thomas Paine.In the 1770s, Paine’s Common Sense helped spark the American Revolution and hisAmerican Crisis helped keep George Washington’s troops from quitting on him. Inthe 1960s, no one could be counted on more than Phil Ochs to perform at ananti-war rally and supply energy for the anti-war movement. Ochs’s performanceof his song “I Ain’t Marching Anymore” during a protest concert outside the 1968Democratic National Convention inspired many young men to burn their draftcards.As a teenager, what I loved most about Ochs was how he confronted the liars andhypocrites who had created misery for my generation. Ochs’s humor was far moreenergizing for me than the tired rants of his anti-war contemporaries. Eventhough liberals were a large part of his audience, Ochs also made fun ofhypocrites on the Left, most famously in his song “Love Me, I’m a Liberal.”What made Phil especially endearing was that he reserved some of his mostpointed barbs for himself. In his songs and his quips, Phil Ochs modeled ahugely important trait for anti-­authoritarians—maintaining a sense of humor andnot taking oneself too seriously. However, at the end of his life, Ochs modeledthe opposite trait—an anti-authoritarian who loses his sense of humor, becomesself-absorbed, and ends up in a dark place.Because his rise and fall came during my most impressionable years, Phil Ochs’slife served as both an inspiring model and a cautionary tale for me. I rememberas a teenager listening repeatedly to “When I’m Gone,” his song about the valueof staying alive despite the pain of life. As beautiful and life-­affirming asthat song is, I recall wondering whether he might commit suicide. It was clearto me that he was a fragile guy trying his best not to be defeated by life’spains. Ochs’s songs were therapy for many of us fragile teenagers, inspiring usto have the courage to face life. However, Ochs himself ultimately succumbed tohis overwhelming pains.Throughout Phil Ochs’s life, there were very real pains, beginning in hishousehold growing up. Phil’s mother was disappointed in her marriage and herlife, and she took out her frustrations on her husband, “berating him as afailure and criticizing his every move around the house,” notes Ochs biographerMichael Schumacher. Phil’s father, Jack Ochs, was a physician but a financiallyunsuccessful one. In the U.S. military during World War II, Jack had treatedsoldiers injured in the Battle of the Bulge. The carnage was traumatizing forJack, and he became a war casualty, receiving an honorable medical discharge.When Jack came home, he was psychiatrically hospitalized for two years,disconnecting Phil from his father.Phil was a shy child and tended to be withdrawn even in his own family; andthroughout his career, he used and abused alcohol and drugs to reduce hisperformance anxiety. There is, of course, a long and ever-growing list ofanti-authoritarian musicians who have engaged in self-destructive behaviors,especially substance abuse, though not all abused substances for the samereason.As a performer, Ochs was known for his playful bravado, however, he wassensitive to criticism, and music critics were rough on him. Some criticsfocused on the range of his voice and guitar-playing skills rather than what wePhil Ochs fans cared about—which was what he was saying and how powerfully hesaid it. An Esquire music critic in 1968 mocked Ochs’s album Pleasures of theHarbor: “Too bad his voice shows an effective range of about half an octave . .. too bad his guitar playing would not suffer much if his right hand werewebbed.” Around that time, Ochs also began experiencing a more general careerpain, as the mainstream popularity of folk music began disappearing, and therewas especially a decreasing market for his niche of ­topical-political folkmusic.Political impotency in effecting change was also painful for Ochs. After thepolice violence at the 1968 Chicago Democratic National Convention and thenomination of Vietnam War supporter Hubert Humphrey, Ochs said, “I don’t thinkfairness wins anymore.” Phil’s friend Lucian Truscott observed: “There were somany awful things that happened in the 60s, the war in Vietnam, both the Kennedybrothers getting killed, and Martin Luther King. It just seemed like one hammerblow after another. And I think Phil was a big enough egomaniac to take it allpersonally.”In 1973, Ochs was devastated by the torture and assassination of his friend andhero Victor Jara, the Chilean protest singer who was murdered during theU.S.-backed military coup d’état that overthrew the democratically electedSalvador Allende government in Chile. Compounding these pains, a blow to Ochs’sphysical health had occurred earlier. On a trip to Africa in 1973, in Dar esSalaam, Tanzania, walking alone on the beach, Phil was attacked and robbed.During the assault he was choked, which ruptured his vocal chords and damagedhis vocal range.While Ochs was assaulted by others—physically and psychologically—he alsoassaulted himself. There is a lengthy list of anti-authoritarian artists who,overwhelmed by the pains of their lives, move down the path from casual alcoholand drug use to its abuse, with eventually this abuse being a major factor intheir demise. Phil Ochs is on that list.“As a casual drinker,” Schumacher notes, “Phil was fun to be around, but when hewas drinking heavily, especially if he was in a depressed state, he could beunreasonable and contentious and, on rare occasions, violent.” Earlier in Phil’slife, Schumacher notes, “he looked at Valium the same way he regarded otherdrugs—as substances that could hinder, rather than open, the mind.” However,when he moved to California in 1967, Schumacher reported, “Phil stepped up hisintake of Valium, and his dependency became more apparent,” at one point flyinginto a rage when a drug store refused to sell him any. He increasingly drankalcohol and this coupled with his Valium dependency made him no fun to bearound.After 1968, friends reported that he drank day and night, and that his house wasa wreck. Fellow musicians reported that he increasingly took drugs to getthrough performances. Pianist Lincoln Mayorga reported that Phil was abusinghimself very badly on a 1970 tour, “He was drinking a lot of wine and takinguppers. . . . The wine was pulling him one way and the uppers were pulling himanother way, and he was kind of a mess. There were so many pharmaceuticalsaround—so many pills. I’d never seen anything like that.”In 1971, after an evening of excessive drinking, Ochs had an argument with hisgirlfriend and got into his car and began racing down Sunset Boulevard in LosAngeles. He crossed over the center line and crashed into a car coming from theopposite direction. The collision slammed Ochs’s face into the steering wheeland knocked out several of his teeth. Police arrested Phil for felonious drunkendriving and he was taken in handcuffs to the hospital. Luckily, he did not killthe other driver, and because the other driver was also drunk, Phil faced nolawsuit, and criminal charges against him were dropped.Phil’s brother, Michael Ochs, who managed Phil’s later career said, “He nevershould have followed me to L.A. Whenever I don’t want to get into a lengthyconversation with people who ask me, ‘What killed your brother,’ I’ll say‘L.A.’”Beyond physically assaulting himself with alcohol and drugs, Ochspsychologically beat himself up for his lack of success. Even among artists whodon’t aspire to great wealth, it’s difficult to have the energy to perseverewithout the ambition of reaching a larger audience, and that was certainly thecase with Phil Ochs. Larry Marks, producer of Phil’s album Pleasures of theHarbor, recalled that everybody else involved in it was realistic that it wasn’tgoing to have wide appeal but that Phil saw no reason why this album would nottop the charts. Ochs greatly admired Víctor Jara but also envied Jara’sachievement of being a protest singer with popular appeal throughout Chile. Ochsfantasized about having that kind of massive appeal in the United States, buthis fantasies were unrealistic given the far less politicized U.S. generalpublic. And because Ochs couldn’t dial back expectations around success, he feltlike a failure, and he punished himself for it.Ochs also gave the wrong people too much psychological power over him. Hisdesire for Bob Dylan’s respect and friendship made him vulnerable to Dylan’scruelty. Dylan would taunt and mock his fellow folk singers’ desire for fame,saying, “Nobody’s gonna make it. Maybe you think you’re gonna do what I did.Nobody’s gonna do it.’” Dylan was brutal with Ochs, “You ought to find a newline of work, Ochs. . . . Why don’t you just become a stand-up comic?” Perhapsone of Dylan’s most psychologically lethal communications to Ochs was: “Thestuff you’re writing is bullshit because politics is bullshit. It’s all unreal.The only thing that’s real is inside you. Your feelings. Just look at the worldyou’re writing about and you’ll see that you’re wasting your time.” This Dylancomment was especially psychologically lethal for someone with Phil’stemperament, the dark side of which was wallowing in his feelings.Sadly, Ochs did turn more inward. Singer-song writer Judy Henske, Ochs’s friend,recounted Ochs’s deterioration, “He had stopped looking outward. See, that’s thescary thing. Before it had been all outward . . . . What do I think about thispolitician? What do I think about this action? What do I think about thisperson? That’s what he did before. But then he got sick, and it was all: What doI think about me? What do I think about me?”Many people who cared about Phil Ochs saw his friendships with Abbie Hoffman andJerry Rubin as hurtful. They saw Hoffman’s and Rubin’s narcissism as hurtingOchs’s career and hurting the anti-war movement—and both those failures painedPhil. At a Carnegie Hall concert that was important for Ochs’s career, Hoffmantook the microphone and started yelling, “Fuck Lyndon Johnson! Fuck RobertKennedy! And fuck you if you don’t like it!” The crowd demanded Rubin andHoffman leave, which they did but not before they had destroyed the concert.After the 1968 Democratic convention, Ochs concluded that the outrageoustheatrics of Rubin and Hoffman might have gained them attention but had servedto alienate America’s working class from the anti-war movement, and Phil beathimself up for being a part of those negative theatrics.“When Phil was depressed, he wallowed in it,” Michael Ochs observed. A yearbefore his suicide, Phil became bizarre, taking on the identity of John Train.Phil announced, “On the first day of summer 1975, Phil Ochs was murdered in theChelsea Hotel by John Train, who is now speaking. I killed Phil Ochs. The reasonI killed him was he was some kind of genius but he drank too much and wasbecoming a boring old fart. For the good of societies, public and secret, heneeded to be gotten rid of.” Ochs’s John Train creation drank heavily, pickedfights in bars, and was unkempt and homeless. Eventually John Train disappeared,and Phil Ochs returned, but many friends wanted him to admit himself to apsychiatric hospital, which he resisted.In 1976, Phil moved in with his sister, Sonny, living in Rockaway, New York. Hewas quiet and passive, doing little but watching television and occasionallyplaying cards with his nephews. Sonny finally convinced Phil to consult with apsychiatrist, and she was happy when he told her that he received a psychiatricdrug prescription. Sonny was also happy when she was able to talk Phil intoplaying a few songs for a gathering of her friends, and she was hopeful when twodays later they went shopping for a new guitar. But four days after that, Philcommitted suicide, hanging himself in Sonny’s home. Later, Sonny found Phil’scontainer of psychiatric drugs and discovered that he had taken none of them.From my experience, it is not uncommon for anti-­authoritarians such as PhilOchs to readily admit that they are in bad mental shape but to rejectpsychiatric diagnoses and treatment. This is especially true when psychiatrictreatment has not been of great benefit to either themselves or to a familymember—in Phil’s case, his father. Later, I will discuss ways to approachdestructive and self-destructive behaviors that differ from standard psychiatrictreatments, approaches that anti-­authoritarians are more receptive to.Lenny BruceLenny Bruce (1925–1966) is revered by many modern comedians for sacrificing hiscareer for free speech. The essence of being both a stand-up comedian and socialcritic is to be anti-­authoritarian—to question and make fun of illegitimateauthority. Rolling Stone’s top three stand-up comics in U.S. history—RichardPryor, George Carlin, and Lenny Bruce—were all talented anti-authoritarians whoengaged in dangerous substance abuse. Bruce was assaulted by the criminaljustice system, but he also assaulted himself, primarily with drugs—lethally so.Born Leonard Schneider in Long Island, New York, Lenny Bruce had a verydifferent temperament than the shy Phil Ochs. “As a child,” Bruce recounted, “Iloved confusion: a freezing blizzard that would stop all traffic and mail;toilets that would get stopped up and overflow and run down the halls;electrical failures—anything that would stop the flow and make it back up andfind a new direction. Confusion was entertainment for me.”At age 16, Lenny ran away from home and boarded with the Dengler family, workingon their Long Island farm. He would give Mr. Dengler big hugs, and Mrs. Denglercalled him the “kissing bug,” and both the Denglers told Lenny that he wouldprobably end up being a politician. For many people today, it’s difficult toimagine a young Lenny—who would later be labeled the “sick comedian”—living andworking on a farm for two years.From early on, Bruce was attracted to a fun scam, especially one with familyinvolvement. When Bruce worked for the Denglers in the 1940s, they had aroadside stand, and city and suburban folks loved the idea of fresh farm eggs,but the Denglers didn’t have enough chickens to meet the demand. So the Denglerswould buy eggs wholesale, and a teenage Lenny repackaged them in Denglercartons. Bruce would later recount, “With my philanthropic sense of humor, Iwould add a little mud and straw and chicken droppings to give them an authenticpastoral touch.”Bruce’s rebellions against authority, on stage and off, remain legendary amongcomics. Fed up with the navy in 1945, Bruce told medical officers he wasoverwhelmed with homosexual urges, and this tactic worked to get him discharged.He then fell in love with Honey, a stripper at the time, and they married in1951. To raise money so that Honey could leave her profession, Lenny engineeredthe Brother Mathias Foundation scam, in which he impersonated a priest andsolicited donations. Bruce was arrested for that scam but was lucky and foundnot guilty.On stage, Bruce was fearless. He worked as an MC at strip clubs, and followingone performer, he himself came on stage completely naked and said, “Let’s givethe little girl a big hand.” In Bruce’s time, it was still common for someChristians to accuse Jews of killing Jesus Christ, and this would put most Jewson the defensive—but not Lenny. In his act, Lenny would “fess up” that not onlydid the Jews kill Jesus but that it was his Uncle Morty who did it. In onevariation of this bit, he said that what in fact Jews really had covered up wasthat his Uncle Morty had killed Jesus with an electric chair but that Jewsthought that Christian women wouldn’t be as attractive wearing necklaces withJesus in an electric chair dangling over their chests, so Jews made up thecrucifixion story.However, as Bruce became more famous for his risk-taking humor that fearlesslymocked authorities, his luck eventually ran out. He was arrested multiple timesfor obscenity during his stand-up act as well as for drug possession. Brucebelieved that authorities went after him mostly because he made fun of organizedreligion. His friend George Carlin (profiled later) agreed, “Lenny wasn’t beingarrested for obscenity. He was being arrested for being funny about religion andin particular Catholicism. A lot of big city cops . . . tend to be IrishCatholic,” and as the Irish Catholic Carlin pointed out, so too were manyprosecutors and judges.In the years before his death, Bruce became increasingly preoccupied by how toprevent arrest for drug use. In his autobiography, Bruce wrote, “Forself-protection, I now carry with me at all times a small bound bookletconsisting of photostats of statements made by physicians, and prescriptions andbottle labels.” Bruce displayed one of those statements from Dr. NormanRotenberg who wrote about Lenny: “His response to oral amphetamine has not beenparticularly satisfactory, so he has been instructed in the proper use ofintravenous injections of Methedrine.”In 1964, Bruce was arrested on obscenity charges in New York and, despitepetitions and protests from many renowned people, he was convicted and sentencedin December 1964 to four months in a workhouse. Free on bail during the lengthyappeals process, he continued to appear on stage in 1965.In July 1966, with Bruce still free on bail, Carlin and his wife visited him,and Carlin recalled, “He was completely immersed in his legal battles. . . . Hedidn’t appear in clubs anymore—the Irish cops and judges had indeed shut him thefuck up. He was just about bankrupt, having spent all his income and intellecttrying to vindicate himself. We visited for a while and he was as affectionateand lovable as ever. That was the last time we saw him alive.” Twelve days aftertheir visit, on August 3, 1966, Lenny Bruce, at age 40, died of a drug overdose.At the time of his death, Bruce was blacklisted by almost every venue in theUnited States, as owners feared that they too would be arrested for obscenity.One of the district attorneys who prosecuted Bruce’s last 1964 obscenity case,Vincent Cuccia, later admitted, “We drove him into poverty and bankruptcy andthen murdered him. . . . We all knew what we were doing. We used the law to killhim.” In 2003, the governor of New York gave Bruce a posthumous pardon.Bruce famously said, “I’m not a comedian. And I’m not sick. The world is sickand I’m the doctor. I’m a surgeon with a scalpel for false values. I don’t havean act. I just talk. I’m just Lenny Bruce.” At the end of his career, Brucebecame dominated by his legal proceedings. When he was still able to get gigs,audiences who came to see him to laugh would hear Bruce read courtroomtranscripts onstage, which were funny to him but not for most of his audience.In Bruce’s situation of being deprived of First Amendment rights to free speechnecessary for his craft and thus deprived of the ability to make a living, it isunderstandable that he became increasingly self-absorbed and lost some of hissense of humor.The legal assault on Bruce accelerated his self-destructive substance abuse. Andsubstance abuse—especially with opiates—along with increased self-absorption isa lethal combination for many anti-authoritarians, both famous and non-famous.Ida LupinoAmong the long list of anti-authoritarian actors and others involved in the filmindustry who have moved to self-destructive behaviors, I am most drawn to IdaLupino (1918–1995). It is a sad commentary on modern U.S. society that perhapsthe most talented and accomplished anti-authoritarian woman in the history ofU.S. cinema has received so little attention, even from many self-identifiedfeminists.To the extent that Lupino is remembered at all, it is often only as a beautifulactress who played femme fatale characters, but she was far more accomplished.Ida Lupino exhibited raw honest emotionality before “method acting” becamefashionable; she rebelled against the control of major studios and created anindependent production company; and she wrote screenplays and directed films ina time when female directors were virtually unheard of.Born in England, Ida’s parents were well-known English entertainers. Young Ida,even after her father’s death, cared about fulfilling the Lupino family legacyin a way that her father would be proud of. As a teenager, while working in thefilm industry in England, she was spotted by Hollywood, and she signed withParamount and moved to the United States. Similar to Frances Farmer, the studioattempted to exploit her sex appeal, and Lupino also rebelled.Even though only a teenager, Lupino made clear to Paramount executives that shewanted roles that she could “get [her]teeth into.” So when she was given just afew lines in the 1934 film Cleopatra and ordered to stand behind its star(Claudette Colbert) and wave a palm frond, Lupino refused the role. Paramountplaced her on suspension. Finally getting a substantive acting role, she woncritical acclaim for her performance in The Light That Failed (1939). Eventuallyshe got fed up with Paramount authorities and signed with Warner Brothers, andin her early twenties, she again won acclaim in They Drive by Night (1940) andHigh Sierra (1941). But increasingly disgusted with the studio system, Lupinogot suspended from Warner Brothers. Unfazed by her studio suspensions, she usedthat time to go on movie sets and acquire directing skills.Dreaming of bucking the Hollywood studio system, Lupino partnered with producerCollier Young (whom she married in 1948), and they created an independentproduction company, Filmmakers (originally called Emerald Productions). Theyproduced movies about social issues that major Hollywood studios were afraid totouch. Lupino wrote Not Wanted about an unmarried pregnant woman, and when thefilm’s director suffered a heart attack early in production, Lupino took overdirecting. She became the second woman ever to belong to the Screen DirectorsGuild, and at the time of her induction, the only working female director in theguild. Lupino went on to co-write and direct Outrage, which focused on rape, andFilmmakers made other films on social issues that the big Hollywood studiosavoided. Unlike major Hollywood studio executives, Lupino and Young wereunintimidated by the witch hunts of the U.S. Congressional House Un-AmericanActivities Committee.Lupino’s marriage with Young dissolved in part because of the strains of theirworking relationship, but they remained friends. In 1951, Lupino married actorHoward Duff, a marriage which she would later view as a major mistake, as Duffhad made clear to all that he was not fit to be a husband. Lupino remained loyalto Duff, who was a casualty of redbaiting, listed in the smear publication RedChannels. This smearing cost Duff acting offers, and Lupino financially kept himand their marriage afloat. Lupino’s production company employed Duff, and whenFilmmakers was forced to close down because of lack of funds, Lupino compromisedherself and took on film roles solely to make a buck.Duff was a heavy drinker, and when he refused to stop, Lupino angrily reacted byabusing alcohol herself. Between her career difficulties and financial pains,the death of her mother, with whom she had a close relationship, and atumultuous on-and-off-again relationship with Duff (whom she finally divorced in1983), Ida Lupino was propelled into heavier drinking and psychiatric drug use.With Hollywood gossip about her substance abuse, her career was hurt even moreand this increased her self-destructive behavior. By age 66, the once fiercelyindependent Lupino had become incapable of self-care. Her friend Mary AnnAnderson, who would ultimately run Lupino’s estate reported, “She had becomelike a grand bag lady. . . . Everything was a disaster.” At age 77, Lupino diedwhile undergoing treatment for cancer.According to her daughter, Ida Lupino was full of doubts about her talents, asis the case with many self-destructive performers. Ida Lupino had overwhelmingpain in her life and resorted to substance abuse to deal with that pain.The general public is repeatedly told that these life-ending tragedies could beavoided if substance abusers were not resistant to treatment early on. But thereis a long list of famous performers who have taken the standard professionaltreatment route to no avail. In the end, anti-authoritarians need to find a wiseway to reduce pain and increase joy, while also finding the morale and energy tochange bad habits.By coincidence, Phil Ochs, Lenny Bruce, and Ida Lupino each had one child, adaughter. A sweet aspect of the bittersweet legacies of these talentedanti-authoritarians is that each of their daughters—Meegan Ochs, Kitty Bruce,and Bridget Duff—today make known their great affection for their deceasedanti-authoritarian parent.Violent Anti-Authoritarians: Alexander Berkman, Leon Czolgosz, Ted KaczynskiOverwhelming pain is also common among those anti-­authoritarians whose violentactions have hurt others and the cause of anti-authoritarianism. Overwhelmed bythe pain of societal injustices and their own personal humiliations andpowerlessness, they can act compulsively and reactively rather than wiselychoosing actions that can best liberate themselves and others. Violent actionsfueled by rage are usually not well thought out actions, especially with regardto the ultimate consequences for others.Anti-authoritarians who move to violence are often quite willing to die. Whilethey may sincerely believe that they are willing to die for their cause, theyare often unaware of their need to be perceived as courageous by others. Thislack of awareness skews their judgment as to the likely consequences of theirviolence.For many violent anti-authoritarians, a need for life’s pleasures signifiesweakness and an inadequate loyalty to the cause. However, the absence ofpleasure in their lives can make their pains even more excruciating, drivingthem to compulsive actions.Among this group of violent anti-authoritarians, anger over societal andpersonal injustice is often quite justifiable, and their experience ofpowerlessness to produce justice for society and themselves is often quitepainful. This combination of rage and impotency can act like a disinhibitingdrug that allows for the sort of moral and strategic justifications for violentactions that would not seem moral or strategic at all without this disinhibitingemotional state.Violence by anti-authoritarians is often welcomed by authoritarians. Suchviolence provides authoritarians with ammunition to persuade the public of thedanger of anti-authoritarians and the need for strong rulers.Alexander BerkmanAlexander Berkman (1870–1936) was one of the most famous anarchists in U.S.history. He is most remembered for his failed attempt to assassinate CarnegieSteel Company manager Henry Clay Frick during the Homestead, Pennsylvania,steelworkers’ strike in 1892. Among anti-authoritarians who have violentlyreacted to oppressive authority, I will focus most on Berkman because his PrisonMemoirs of an Anarchist provides us with his justifications and motivations.Unlike others who have turned to violence, Berkman cannot so easily be dismissedas unstable or “mentally ill,” as he was admired for his integrity even by thoseoutside the anarchist movement.The famously cynical journalist H. L. Mencken, criticizing the U.S. government’sdeportation of Berkman, described Berkman as a “transparently honest man,” butsaid that “we hunt him as if he were a mad dog—and finally kick him out of thecountry. And with him goes a shrewder head and a braver spirit than has beenseen in public among us since the Civil War.” For historian Paul Avrich, Berkmanwas “a man of uncompromising integrity.” And while Berkman gained fame for oneact of violence, he also undertook life-saving actions.Known to his friends and family as Sasha, Alexander Berkman was born in theRussian Empire in present-day Lithuania. His father was a successful merchant,and his mother came from an affluent family. At age twelve, his father died, thefamily business was sold, and his mother moved the family so as to be close toher brother.At a young age, Sasha admired Nikolay Chernyshevsky, a Russian revolutionary,and he was attracted to the Russian nihilist movement which rejected societalauthorities and embraced individual freedom. Berkman had initially done verywell at school but then began blowing off his school work to read revolutionarypolitical works. He turned in a paper titled “There Is No God,” resulting in aone-year demotion as punishment. This punishment forced him to be with youngerchildren, and Berkman recounted, “My senior class looks down upon [me] withundisguised contempt. I feel disgraced, humiliated.”Berkman’s mother died when he was 18, and his uncle became responsible for him,but young Sasha had contempt for his uncle, who Sasha viewed as cowardly andmaterialistic. Sasha was caught stealing copies of the annual school exam, andhe was expelled and labeled a “nihilist conspirator.” Soon after, in 1888,Berkman immigrated to the United States, where he joined a group of anarchistsin New York City who admired Johann Most. And soon after that, he became EmmaGoldman’s lover and ultimately her lifelong friend.In 1892, Alexander Berkman, at age 21, became a household name in the UnitedStates for his failed assassination attempt of Henry Clay Frick. Berkman laterrecounted the arousing of his passion and his justification for attempting tokill Frick. He tells us how Emma Goldman (protecting her identity, he refers toher as “the Girl”), a year older than him, waves a newspaper and cries out,“Have you read it? . . . Homestead. Strikers shot. Pinkertons have killed womenand children.” Berkman tells us that Goldman’s “words ring like the cry of awounded animal, the melodious voice tinged with the harshness of bitterness—thebitterness of helpless agony.”Berkman recounts his contempt for the hypocrisy of the “philanthropist” AndrewCarnegie, who had chosen Frick to manage his company for the purpose of crushingthe labor union. For Berkman, Frick is not simply an illegitimate authority, butevil in “his secret military preparations . . . the fortification of theHomestead steelworks; the erection of a high board fence, capped by barbed wireand provided with loopholes for sharpshooters; the hiring of an army ofPinkerton thugs.”Recounting his justification for killing Frick, Berkman concludes: “The removalof a tyrant is not merely justifiable; it is the highest duty of every truerevolutionist. Human life is, indeed, sacred and inviolate. But the killing of atyrant, of an enemy of the People, is in no way to be considered as the takingof a life. A revolutionist would rather perish a thousand times than be guiltyof what is ordinarily called murder. In truth, murder and Attentat [a politicaldeed of violence to awaken the consciousness of the people against theiroppressors] are to me opposite terms. To remove a tyrant is an act ofliberation, the giving of life and opportunity to an oppressed people.”Berkman felt that he had thought through the consequences of his action,believing his act would help his cause of anarchism. He believed that the valueof his action “very much depends upon my explanation” which “offers me a rareopportunity for a broader agitation of our ideas.” For Berkman, “the People”misunderstood the cause of anarchism because they had been prejudiced by thecapitalist press. “They must be enlightened; that is our glorious task.” In theend, Berkman tragically failed to think through the consequences of his actions.His attempt at explaining his actions to the public was a pathetic failure, andthe consequences of his actions were tragic for the Homestead strikers, forother workers, and for the cause of anarchism.At his trial, Berkman refused a lawyer and instead wrote a speech in Germanbecause his English was then still poor. He read it to the court, which used aGerman translator who was incompetent, and the judge cut Berkman off before hewas done. And so Berkman’s statement thus failed to enlighten the public.Prior to Berkman’s assassination attempt, a majority of U.S. newspapers had beensupportive of the Homestead strikers, but Berkman’s violence undermined publicsympathy for the strikers, and thus Berkman’s action was one reason for thestrike failure. Especially humiliating for Berkman was that his failedassassination attempt garnered public admiration for Frick, who became seen lessas a villain and more a survivor. Moreover, throughout the United States, thisdefeat at Homestead demoralized workers and emboldened owners to successfullyde-unionize other workers.Berkman’s act of violence also hurt his cause of anarchism in immediate andlong-term ways. After Berkman’s assassination attempt, a mob destroyed a utopiananarchist community near Homestead. Moreover, because of Berkman’s violentactions (coupled later with the self-identified anarchist Leon Czolgosz’sassassination of McKinley), anarchism was now more easily marginalized asnothing but a violent philosophy. This must have been especially painful for themature Berkman, who took great lengths in his 1929 book Now and After: The ABCof Communist Anarchism to describe how the essence of anarchism is theantithesis of violence, especially compared to the violence inherent incapitalism.Following his failed assassination attempt, Berkman beat himself up, “My failureto accomplish the desired result is grievously exasperating, and I feel deeplyhumiliated.” To make matters worse, Berkman’s assassination attempt wascondemned by many of those whom he had thought would praise it. Berkman was hurtwhen he was criticized by the strikers, and he was angered by the attack on himfrom his former mentor Johann Most. Before Berkman’s actions, Most had reversedhimself on the value of violent “propaganda by the deed,” saying that it wasdoomed to be misunderstood in the United States and thus would have negativeconsequences for the cause of anarchism.Later in his life, Berkman himself disapproved of the assassination of McKinley.He concluded that in Russia, political oppression is popularly felt, however,“the scheme of political subjection is more subtle in America. . . .The realdespotism of republican institutions is far deeper, more insidious, because itrests on the popular delusion of self-government and independence. That is thesubtle source of democratic tyranny, and, as such, it cannot be reached with abullet.”Historian John William Ward in his 1970 article “Violence, Anarchy, andAlexander Berkman” concluded that acts of violence against U.S. authorities failbecause most Americans accept the idea that the United States is a uniquely freesociety. Ward noted, “Violence has been used again and again to support thestructure of authority in American society. We are only puzzled when violence isused to attack that structure.”To attempt to kill Frick, Berkman stripped Frick of his humanity. As Ward noted,“Berkman has turned him into an object, a symbol of the repressive forces ofcapitalism. It is not Frick, the man, but Frick, the symbol, there beforeBerkman. Berkman must do the same to himself. He must deny his own humanity, hisown feeling, and turn himself into an instrument of a cause, a symbol of arevolutionary ideology.” Early in prison, Berkman’s sentimental glorification ofthe People, noted Ward, “provides no room in his affections for ordinary, flawedhuman beings. He shrinks from familiarity with other prisoners.”However, Berkman’s humanity and attitude toward his fellow prisoners evolved.Berkman recounted that at first, “I would aid them, as in duty bound to thevictims of social injustice. But I cannot be friends with them. . . . I mustgive them my intellectual sympathy; they touch no chord in my heart.” ButBerkman, in prison, recognized how conditions can damage people, and he morefully accepted humanity’s flaws and his own flaws, recounting, “I recall withsadness the first years of my imprisonment, and my coldly impersonal valuationof social victims.”Ward believed, “The remarkable thing is that he learns what it means to behuman, that to love humanity means to love the least of men. As he moves from acold and abstract idealism to a warm and sympathetic identification, even to anunembarrassed and untroubled acceptance of the reality of homosexual love.”Shortly after being imprisoned, Berkman planned his suicide; and in prison, heunsuccessfully attempted to hang himself. In 1906, after serving 14 years of hissentence, Berkman was released at age 35. Tormented by nightmares and havingdifficulty adjusting to life outside prison, he again considered suicide butagreed to go on a speaking tour with Goldman. On the tour, he purchased a gun tocommit suicide but did not use it.Berkman and Goldman, not long after reconnecting, discovered that they had lostsexual passion for one another, and Berkman became attracted to another woman.In 1907, Goldman, who would remain a loyal friend to Berkman for his entirelife, invited him to become the editor of her journal Mother Earth. Berkmanserved as editor of Mother Earth from 1907 to 1915, and it became the leadinganarchist publication in the United States.In 1916, Berkman moved to San Francisco and started a new anarchist newspaper,the Blast. Not long after his move, a San Francisco bomb explosion was initiallyattributed to him, but blame then shifted to two local labor activists, ThomasMooney and Warren Billings. Although neither were anarchists, Berkman came totheir aid, raising a defense fund, hiring lawyers, and organizing a nationalcampaign on their behalf. After Mooney was sentenced to death and Billings tolife imprisonment, Berkman organized protests outside the U.S. embassy inRussia, resulting in international political pressure; this ultimately led tothe commuting of Mooney’s death sentence. Billings and Mooney both were pardonedand freed in 1939. So Berkman, who had tried to kill one man, helped saveanother’s life.With the U.S. government’s entry into World War I and its creation of a militarydraft, Goldman and Berkman formed the No Conscription League; and they wereprosecuted and imprisoned for this and ultimately deported to Russia. Berkman,similar to Goldman, became disillusioned with Lenin and Bolshevik tyranny, andhe published The Bolshevik Myth in 1925. Around that time, we again seeBerkman’s altruism. He organized a fund for aging anarchists and drewinternational attention to the plight of anarchist prisoners in the SovietUnion.Having moved to France, Berkman spent a good part of the remainder his lifestruggling with money and health issues. His cousin Modska Aronstam (changinghis last name to Stein)—who had been a co-conspirator in the Frick assassinationbut had left the anarchist movement and had become a successful artist—sentBerkman money for his expenses. However, by the 1930s, Berkman’s health haddeteriorated. He had two unsuccessful operations on his prostate, the secondsurgery leaving him bedridden for several months. In constant pain andcompletely dependent on others financially and for his physical care, a65-year-old Berkman committed suicide.Alexander Berkman’s life offers many lessons for anti-­authoritarians who arepolitically passionate and who pride themselves on uncompromising ideologicalintegrity. Berkman, like many other violent anti-authoritarians, viewed a needfor material pleasures as weakness and a betrayal of the cause. Berkman deniedhimself even small consumer pleasures—and he expected the same from his fellowanarchists, which created friction with his comrades. He lectured them, “Everypenny spent for ourselves was so much taken from the Cause. . . . [L]uxury is acrime, worse, a weakness.” Berkman was, Goldman tells us, “fanatic to thehighest degree.”However, Berkman’s insufficient attention to money created humiliating financialdependency for him, compounding his pain. Throughout their lives, Berkman was atodds with Goldman and her view of money. After being deported with Emma Goldmanto Russia, Berkman was robbed while carrying their entire travel fund. Goldmanbecame upset, “Our independence! . . . [I]t’s gone.” For Goldman, that money wascrucial to their independence, “We did not have to beg or cringe like so manyothers. . . . We had been able to keep our self-respect and to refuse any truckwith the dictatorship.” But Berkman mocked her for thinking of money and notappreciating the fact that he wasn’t killed. For Goldman, “I simply could notface the possibility of eating out of the hand of the Bolshevik State.”Throughout Berkman’s life and especially late in life, his financial dependencyon others was humiliating, one of several painful reasons for his suicide.In Sasha and Emma, Paul Avrich and Karen Avrich report that while Berkman was“admired by his friends for his brains and his nerve, he also could beself-centered and dogmatic. . . . Yet he possessed a gentle demeanor, adisarming humor. Within him mingled the visionary and the subversive, the humaneand the harsh, the passionate and the pitiless.” His cousin Modska’s daughterrecalled that when she was a child, Berkman “often came to our apartment in NewYork, a sweet and charming man.” The Avriches note, “Sasha had a way withchildren; they were drawn instinctively to him, and he was indulgent andaffectionate in return, treating them with patience, kindness, and respect.”Among anti-authoritarians who have acted violently, Alexander Berkman is notdismissed by most historians as “mentally ill” or a “nut.” Unfortunately, otherviolent anti-authoritarians are so dismissed, and so the lessons from their lifeare ignored, which compounds the tragedy of their lives.Leon CzolgoszThe man who assassinated President William McKinley was Leon Czolgosz(1873–1901). The socially awkward Czolgosz is routinely dismissed by historiansas “mentally ill” or a “nut,” but Czolgosz’s tragic life has lessons worthconsidering.Leon was born in Michigan, and his mother died when he was ten years old. The1893 financial crash put him out of work, and he became interested first insocialism and then in anarchism. At age 25, he moved back with his father on hisfather’s farm but did not get along with his stepmother, and Leon did little tohelp out.Forensic psychiatrist L. Vernon Briggs in his 1921 book The Manner of Man ThatKills reported family and friends’ observations of Czolgosz. Leon’s sister,Victoria, described him as a nice boy who would read and sleep a good deal ofthe time and preferred being alone. His brother said that Leon got called names.Their father said that Leon was quiet and did not play with other children, butin most other ways he was an ordinary child. Leon’s sister-in-law said that he“did not like it if you talked to him too much” and that he liked being alone.All agreed he was fond of reading and was the best educated member of thefamily. A neighbor said it was strange that Czolgosz could ever haveassassinated McKinley, as Leon would never kill a fly, instead brushing them offor perhaps catching them and letting them go.Czolgosz became a recluse, and when he finally found people he desired toconnect with—other anarchists—and reached out to them, he was tragicallyrebuffed. Czolgosz had been inspired after hearing Emma Goldman speak; and in abrief encounter with her, he remarked to Goldman that he would like to meetother anarchists. Goldman tried to help him make connections. However, whenCzolgosz did meet other anarchists, owing to his extreme social awkwardness,they were made anxious by him. Much of the anarchist community believed Czolgoszmight be a police spy, and they issued a warning about him in their Free Societynewspaper.After gunning down McKinley, Czolgosz was coherent and offered a clear rationalefor his action: “I know other men who believe what I do, that it would be a goodthing to kill the President and to have no rulers. I have heard that at themeetings in public halls. . . . Emma Goldman was the last one I heard. She saidshe did not believe in government nor in rulers. . . . I don’t believe invoting, it is against my principles. I am an anarchist. I don’t believe inmarriage. I believe in free love. I fully understood what I was doing when Ishot the President. I realized that I was sacrificing my life. I am willing totake the consequences.”While Czolgosz had an ideological motive to assassinate McKinley, he also wasoverwhelmed by his life’s painfulness and appears to have had a desperate desireto connect with likeminded people. He was willing to sacrifice his life, perhapsto have at least a short time of comradeship, or perhaps he envisioned theanarchist community’s affection for him after he was put to death. Afterassassinating McKinley, Czolgosz legally protected Goldman, making it clearthat, “She did not tell me to kill McKinley.” Without this statement, publicopinion and authorities were ready to convict Goldman as an accomplice in theassassination.Czolgosz’s jury deliberated for only an hour to convict him, and a month laterin 1901, he was electrocuted. Among his last words were, “I killed the Presidentbecause he was the enemy of the good people—the good working people.”Most anarchists were upset with Czolgosz’s actions and angry with Emma Goldmanfor her support of him, but Goldman’s compassion makes sense. Not only had sheinspired Czolgosz to act and perhaps felt some guilt about that, she also likelyfelt sorry for this bashful lonely guy who had reached out to her anarchistcomrades and had gotten rebuffed—but who then nobly protected her from beingprosecuted.When I have been in anti-authoritarian communities, there has often been asocially awkward person who reminds me of Leon Czolgosz, and I think about theanarchists who rebuffed him and who then later felt great guilt about havingdone so.Ted KaczynskiWhile Czolgosz, to the extent he is written about at all, is dismissed as apathetic nut with nothing to teach us, Ted Kaczynski (born in 1942) is wellknown, but few see his life as having anything to teach, viewing him only asterrifyingly insane.Kaczynski, who came to be known as the Unabomber, is one of the most violentanti-authoritarians in U.S. history. Of all the public figures I profile in thisbook, Ted Kaczynski’s story is, for me, the most tragic—tragic, of course, forhis murder victims; tragically traumatizing for his injury victims and near-missvictims; tragic for the position that he put his family members in; tragic forenabling authoritarians to marginalize causes that many nonviolentanti-authoritarians care about; and tragic for him.Between 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski’s bombs killed three people and injured 23others. While some of his victims had positions of power in his hated“industrial society,” others did not (for example, a murdered computer storeowner and an injured secretary and graduate student). And in an early failedattempt to blow up an airplane by placing a bomb in its cargo hold,anti-­authoritarians who held his same views could well have been killed if thebomb had worked.Ted Kaczynski placed his own family, especially his brother David, in anightmarishly tragic position. Once David read what came to be called the“Unabomber Manifesto” (Industrial Society and Its Future), David realized thatit was Ted’s work, and David had to decide between informing on his brother orcomplicity in further deaths. So David reported his brother to authorities. OnceTed Kaczynski was brought to trial, in order to save him from the death penalty,David and their mother Wanda helped portray Ted as being seriously mentally ill,which enraged Ted against them; as he knew that his political reasons for thebombings would now not be taken seriously.Ted Kaczynski’s biographer Alston Chase reported that much of what the worldheard about Kaczynski’s mental status was not true. Chase documents howKaczynski was psychopathologized for two reasons: the concerns of his family,who wanted to spare him the death penalty; and to meet the needs of societalauthorities who wanted to dismiss his societal critiques. Chase came to discoverthat “Kaczynski is neither the extreme loner he has been made out to be nor inany clinical sense mentally ill.”Intelligence testing conducted on Ted in the fifth grade determined that he hada “genius” 167 IQ. As a result, he skipped the sixth grade, which made itdifficult for him to socialize. Chase reported, “He would never be accepted byhis new classmates, who were at least a year older. The bigger boys bullied andteased him.” But it is a myth that he was a complete social outcast. RobertMcFadden reported in 1996 in the New York Times that in high school, Ted’sfellow math club member and his closest friend, Russell Mosny, played chess withhim, and they talked about equations and physics in Ted’s attic bedroom. Mosnyrecalled, “He was just quiet and shy until you got to know him. Once he knewyou, he could talk and talk.” Ted was accepted at Harvard, and at age 16 hebegan his freshman year.Early on at Harvard, Kaczynski joined the Harvard band, played pickupbasketball, and made a few friends. His housemate Gerald Burns recalled hangingout with Kaczynski at an all-night cafeteria and arguing about the philosophy ofKant. The Harvard health-services doctor who interviewed Kaczynski, as requiredfor all freshmen, observed: “Good impression created. Attractive, mature forage, relaxed. . . . Talks easily, fluently and pleasantly . . . likes people andgets on well with them. . . . Exceedingly stable, well integrated and feelssecure within himself.”However, in Kaczynski’s sophomore year at Harvard, he fell victim to adisturbingly abusive experiment by one of the most renowned figures in thehistory of U.S. psychology, Henry Murray. Experimental subjects were told theywould be debating personal philosophy with a fellow student; but instead, theywere subjected to abusive personal attacks that were purposely brutalizing.Kaczynski and other subjects were instructed to write an essay detailing theirpersonal beliefs and aspirations, and the essay was given to an attorney whowould belittle them based on the disclosures they had made. This humiliation wasfilmed, and played back to the subjects. Thus, Kaczynski had personal reasonsfor rage and for distrust of the elites who managed society.Kaczynski began his 1995 manifesto this way: “The Industrial Revolution and itsconsequences have been a disaster for the human race.” He then discussed how theincreasing growth and worship of technological and industrial systems havesubverted individual freedom and destroyed our natural environment. Themanifesto is approximately 35,000 words and covers many extraneous areas, andwith respect to the tyranny of giant ­industrial-technological systems, forreaders familiar with public intellectuals Kirkpatrick Sale and John Zerzan,Kaczynski’s work may be simplistic, unoriginal, and unenjoyable to read but notinsane.However, politics—not science—dictated that Ted Kaczynski be labeled insane.Against Kaczynski’s wishes, his defense attorneys launched a “mental illness”defense for him. Defense expert psychologist Karen Bronk Froming concluded thatKaczynski exhibited a “predisposition to schizophrenia,” citing hisanti-technology views as having cemented her conclusion. Sally Johnson, aforensic psychiatrist with the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, provisionally diagnosedKaczynski with “Paranoid Type” schizophrenia, largely based on her view that heharbored “delusional beliefs” about the threats posed by technology.In addition to Kaczynski’s views on technology, other so-called “evidence” forhis mental illness included his personal habits and unkempt appearance livingalone in a cabin in Montana. But as Chase—a former Harvard student, formerprofessor, and Montana resident—points out, “His cabin was no messier than theoffices of many college professors. The Montana wilds are filled with escapistslike Kaczynski (and me). Celibacy and misanthropy are not diseases. Nor wasKaczynski really so much of a recluse.”In the end, Kaczynski’s violent behaviors gave authoritarians ammunition to notonly marginalize him as mentally ill, but to discredit as “Kaczynski-like” othercritics of the authoritarian use of technology. Kaczynski’s violence may havegotten him attention but ultimately hurt his cause.***Berkman, Czolgosz, and Kaczynski are certainly not the only anti-authoritariansin U.S. history to gain attention for themselves with violence at the expense ofthe cause of anti-authoritarianism.In 1969, the violent Weatherman (later called the Weather Underground)splintered off from the nonviolent Students for a Democratic Society. The 2002film documentary The Weather Underground portrays how these anti-authoritarians’rage over the injustice of the Vietnam War, along with powerlessness in stoppingthe war through peaceful means, resulted in their resorting to violence,including multiple bombings. This combination of rage over injustice andimpotency in effecting change made them, a former Weather Underground memberlater acknowledged, “crazy.” Here we can clearly see how that rage-impotencycombination acted like a disinhibiting drug enabling moral and strategicjustifications for violent actions that, as some former Weather Undergroundmembers acknowledged, did not later seem moral or strategic at all. The greatestbeneficiaries of the Weather Underground violence were U.S. authoritarians,particularly Richard Nixon, as it provided him with ammunition for his“law-and-order” presidential re-election campaign and aided his 1972 landslidevictory.Some U.S. anti-authoritarians have convinced themselves of the possibility ofthe effectiveness of violence by pointing to John Brown (1800–1859), but Brown’sviolence was effective only because of extraordinary and exceptionalcircumstances. By the time of his death, Brown was viewed as a terrorist by manywhite Americans, beginning with his role in the Pottawatomie, Kansas revengemassacre that killed five people. More famously, Brown led the raid on thefederal armory at Harpers Ferry, designed to foment a slave rebellion. AtHarpers Ferry, several people were killed and wounded. Brown became anabolitionist martyr when he was captured, placed on trial, and hanged. TheHarpers Ferry raid failed to foment a slave rebellion but successfully furtherpolarized slavery proponents and abolitionists, escalated tensions, and helpedprovoke secession resulting in the Civil War.While Brown was in fact successful in becoming an abolitionist martyr, U.S.history has repeatedly shown that individual political violence is ineffectivein gaining desired results without at least some degree of support among theU.S. ruling class. Brown’s Harpers Ferry assault came at a time when there wereU.S. senators who were slave abolitionists and when some in the ruling elite hadfinancial reasons to invade the South, profit from war, and further centralizeauthority. Thus, Brown’s inflaming the South and creating another provocation toattack a federal fort and secede from the union wasn’t just good news for manyabolitionists. It was also good news for at least some of the elite, which wasnot the case at all for the actions of Berkman, Czolgosz, or Kaczynski.In general in U.S. history, while state violence routinely succeeds at puttingdown dissent, citizen violence directed at authoritarianism usually subverts thecause of anti-authoritarianism."},{"pageContent":"9: POLITICAL, SPIRITUAL, PHILOSOPHICAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL LENSES FOR­ANTI-AUTHORITARIANS:Anarchism, Buddhism, the God of Spinoza and Einstein, and the EnneagramAnti-authoritarians tend to resist the dogmas of both secular and religiousauthorities. There are, however, lenses to view the world that can be attractivefor anti-authoritarians. Rather than offering an encyclopedia of such lenses, Iwill present those that I have been drawn to and have found most useful foranti-authoritarians whom I’ve known.Anarchism, Buddhism, the God of Spinoza and Einstein, and the Enneagram are eachbook-length topics, but I have tried to provide a sense of them. With each ofthese lenses, an anti-­authoritarian can feel at home questioning, challenging,and resisting illegitimate authority. With each, there are no hierarchies and nocoercions, and compassion is valued while badges are not. Within each of theselenses, there are different schools of thought, interpretations, and emphases;thus, there are choices within these choices.AnarchismIn one sense, anarchism is a political philosophy, but in another sense, it is abelief about human nature, a faith in the goodness of human beings.Anarchism rejects not only state control but also the hierarchical organizationof human beings in which people have unequal power. Anarchism believes thatpeople can best achieve autonomy, freedom, and cooperation within egalitarianorganizations. Anarchism is positively impassioned by a thirst for freedom inall spheres of life, and it is negatively impassioned by a resentment withcoercion. For critics of anarchism, those passions make anarchism immature anddangerous. But for advocates of anarchism, those passions make it highly matureand benevolent.What’s most radical about anarchism, for me, is its faith that human beings canorganize themselves without fear. This is a radical notion, because people areso accustomed to being controlled by fear that they don’t even notice it Thestate, whatever ideology it claims, keeps people in line using policingauthorities and prisons. Orthodox religions keep congregants in line using thefear of God, clergy, and hell. Standard schools keep students in line usinggrades, suspensions, expulsions, and threats to withhold diplomas. And employeesare kept in line by their fear of being fired and falling into poverty.Authoritarians routinely smear anarchism as advocating chaos and violence. Someof these authoritarians are ignorant of anarchism, while others are not. It istrue some anarchists have used violence to achieve their aims, but anarchistsdon’t seek a violent and chaotic society. Informed authoritarians who spreadfalsehoods about anarchism fear that should people actually grasp the truth ofanarchism, many would be attracted to it.“Anarchism,” according to Alexander Berkman, “means that you should be free;that no one should enslave you, boss you, rob you, or impose upon you. It meansthat you should be free to do the things you want to do; and that you should notbe compelled to do what you don’t want to do. It means that you should have achance to choose the kind of a life you want to live, and live it withoutanybody interfering. It means that the next fellow should have the same freedomas you, that everyone should have the same rights and liberties. It means thatall men are brothers, and that they should live like brothers, in peace andharmony. That is to say, that there should be no war, no violence used by oneset of men against another, no monopoly and no poverty, no oppression, no takingadvantage of your fellow-man.” Of course, Berkman clearly meant to include allgenders here—or else he would not have had Emma Goldman’s lifelong loyalty.Free association is paramount in anarchism, which is optimistic about humanityand its capacity to cooperate. In Emma Goldman’s essay “Anarchism: What ItReally Stands For,” she wrote: “Anarchism stands for a social order based on thefree grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; anorder that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and fullenjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes,and inclinations.”The vision of a society without coercion is attractive to manypeople—intoxicatingly attractive to some people. And anarchism’s attractivenessmakes it so threatening for various authoritarians that anarchism is theircommon enemy. For example, in the 1930s, Nazi Germany, fascist Italy, StalinistSoviet Union, Western capitalist nations, and the Catholic Church all played arole in destroying a successful anarchist society in Spain.Authoritarians are horrified by anarchism because they believe that withoutcoercions, people would run amok and life would be fraught with chaos andviolence. The reality is that coercions do “work” to keep certain populations inline. Social critic Alfie Kohn, in his book Punished by Rewards, documents thatcoercions such as rewards and punishments can be effective in shaping behaviorsof laboratory animals, children, institutionalized adults such as prisoners, andothers who are dependent on authorities for the necessities of their survival.In order to most effectively control people’s behavior, research shows thatpeople have to be needy enough of the rewards and terrified enough of thenegative reinforcements and punishments. And so there is actually an incentivefor authoritarians to keep people alienated and infantilized, as such people areeasier to control. Coercions can effectively control behavior in certainpopulations, but not without humiliation, resentment, and rage. Notcoincidentally, U.S. society is replete with people feeling humiliated,resentful, and enraged.In anarchism, people perform activities that they desire to perform, and socoercion is unnecessary. However, in U.S. society, people are mostly performingactivities they dislike. In 2013, the Los Angeles Times reported, “Seven out of10 workers have ‘checked out’ at work or are ‘actively disengaged,’ according toa recent Gallup survey.” The more one is disengaged from an activity anddependent on authorities for survival, the more coercion is necessary tomaintain order.Anarchism’s opposition to coercion is not an advocacy of chaos but rather afaith that human beings can be organized with love. A key belief of anarchism ismutual aid (discussed later) and cooperation. This requires altruism. Concernfor others is not created by coercive rewards and punishments. Kohn’s review ofthe research confirms that children whose parents use rewards to motivate themare less cooperative and generous children than their peers who are not socoerced. Instead of coercions, it is the experience of love and the modeling oflove that best creates caring and cooperative people.In U.S. society, anarchism is not only a radical political idea but also aradical psychological one. Anarchism asserts that human beings can havecommunity without being dominated by fear. Most of us, consciously orunconsciously, live with great fear and anxiety. Given our ordinary fear-basedexistence, when people experience fearlessness through an extraordinaryexperience, that fearlessness can feel so exhilaratingly different that it canbe intoxicating, sometimes so intoxicating that we can become manic. The morefear pervades a culture, the more extraordinary is the experience offearlessness, and the more likely it will be so intoxicating that it can causeus to behave irrationally. Fearlessness does not intoxicate people who areaccustomed to it.There are anarchists who are rigid ideologues. For them, attempting to survivein an economic system based on the coercion of money is so shameful that theyeither deny their hypocrisies or self-flagellate for their failure to live up totheir ideals. In either case, the rigid ideologue is not going to be much fun tobe around. In current society, if we have no money, we cannot pay the bills thatmost of us have. Without money, we are likely to become either a financialburden on friends or family, at the mercy of some of the most oppressiveauthorities in society, or dead. The reality is that while all aspects of theanarchist ideal cannot be implemented in non-anarchist society, some aspects canbe implemented, even within the workplace. For example, the publisher of thisbook, AK Press, is an egalitarian organization without hierarchical control butaccepts the present reality of money. There are many other such non-hierarchicalworkplaces in the United States.Among anarchists, there are several different schools of thought that emphasizedifferent aspects of anarchism. ­Anarcho-syndicalism, Noam Chomsky explains, isa particular variety of anarchism which is concerned primarily, though notsolely, with control over the workplace. “It took for granted that workingpeople ought to control their own work, its conditions . . . control theenterprises in which they work, along with communities, so they should beassociated with one another in free associations, and . . . democracy of thatkind should be the foundational elements of a more general free society.”Another anarchist school of thought is anarcho-primitivism, a major concern ofwhich is gaining freedom from the tyranny of large-scale authoritariantechnology. Among different schools, there are also different views as to how toachieve an anarchist society.Anti-authoritarian perspectives like anarchism don’t simply provide anindividual with an ideology. Discovering a belief system that rings true canalso serve as a vehicle for connecting with like-minded people. In the 1880s and1890s in the United States, if you were an alienated anti-authoritarian, youcould go to the Lower East Side in New York City and hang out at places such asSach’s Café on Suffolk Street or Justus Schwab’s basement tavern on First Streetwhich called itself a “gathering place for all bold, joyful, ­freedom-lovingspirits.” Here you would meet and connect with all kinds of anti-authoritarians.Your belief system would be a vehicle for a support group and provide anopportunity to connect with friends and lovers. That’s what happened toAlexander Berkman, Emma Goldman, and many others who created a rich socialnetwork for themselves that mitigated some of the pain of being an anarchist inthe United States. In 1900 when Schwab died, 2,000 mourners followed the hearsedown Second Avenue.BuddhismIn The Religions of Man, religious studies scholar Huston Smith states, “Buddhapreached a religion devoid of authority,” and so, not surprisingly, Buddhismappeals to many anti-­authoritarians. Buddhism is a rebellion against what isnormally considered religion.Smith detailed how Buddhism is “a religion almost entirely dissociated from eachof the six corollaries of religion”: (1) authority; (2) ritual; (3) speculation;(4) tradition; (5) God’s supreme power to confer grace; and (6) mystery. InBuddhism, authority is confronted in several manners. Born into the top ofIndia’s Hindu caste system, the Buddha challenged that hierarchy’s legitimacy.Rituals, rites, and prayers were frowned upon by the Buddha who considered it awaste of time speculating on that which one can never know for certain, and hetold his followers to reject traditions if they had no value in reducingsuffering. Rather than depending on God’s grace and resigning oneself tofatalism, the Buddha preached intense self-effort to a path that can lead oneout of suffering in one’s own lifetime. And finally, unlike figureheads of otherreligions, Smith noted, “Buddha preached a religion devoid of the supernatural.”Buddhism is in direct contrast to what we normally view as a religion. Buddhismis empirical, as one’s direct personal experience is the final test for truth.Buddhism is scientific, aimed at uncovering the cause and effect. Buddhism ispragmatic, concerned with problem solving. Buddhism is psychological, in itsstudy of human nature. Buddhism is therapeutic, aimed at alleviating suffering.And Buddhism is democratic, in its attack on the hierarchy of the caste system.Siddhartha Gautama of the Sakyas (approximately 560–480 BCE) was born innorthern India into wealth and royalty. At age 29, deeply discontented, herejected his society and took the next six years to discover the root of hisdespair and the solution to it. He probed the minds of Hindu masters, thenjoined a band of ascetics but ultimately rejected the path of asceticism.Finally, he sat under a fig tree, which has since become known as the Bo tree(short for Bodhi or enlightenment), and with a combination of meditation,rigorous thought, and mystic concentration, he remained in a rapture of sortsfor 49 days. When he opened himself to the world again, he had become theBuddha, meaning the Enlightened One or the Awakened One.The Buddha would spend the next 45 years teaching what he had discovered aboutthe roots of suffering and solutions for it. “Perhaps the most striking thingabout him,” philosopher James Pratt noted in The Pilgrimage of Buddhism and aBuddhist Pilgrimage, “is his almost unique combination of a cool scientific headwith the devoted sympathy of a warm and loving heart.”We in the West commonly learn that the essence of Buddhism is the “Four NobleTruths”: that life is suffering; the cause of suffering is desire; the cure forsuffering is the cessation of craving; and that this can be done through theEightfold Path (of the right knowledge, aspiration, speech, behavior,livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and absorption). This is not wrong, but it doesnot truly capture the essence of Buddhism.In Buddhism, it is certainly true that craving ephemeral pleasures is a badidea—not because it is shamefully sinful but because we become enslaved by it,as these pleasures will be transient and interfere with peace, freedom, andequanimity. In Buddhism, it is not a good idea to desire things that in the longrun will bring us more pain than pleasure. However, for the Buddha, not alldesires are evil.“It is perfectly plain that the Buddha desired a number of things,” Pratt noted.The Buddha was filled with pity for human suffering, and he desired alleviationof that suffering. He dedicated his life to disseminating truths that wouldliberate people from misery, and he trained others to spread these truths. TheBuddha actually taught that there are “bad” and “good” desires. It is a gooddesire to want less ignorance and more compassion. “The two cardinal virtues ofBuddhism,” Pratt tells us are “wisdom and love.”The Buddha saw great ignorance about suffering and attempted to simplify themajor cause of self-inflicted human despair. While suffering is caused bysocietal oppressions, suffering can also be a result of our own self-oppression,specifically through self-preoccupation. Pratt summarizes: “The great bulk ofour woe, thinks the Buddha, most of us bring upon ourselves quite needlessly byviewing everything from its bearing upon our little selves.”In Buddhism, compassion and generosity are not—as they are viewed in most otherreligions—righteous good deeds, but instead are pragmatic vehicles for pullingus out of our self-­absorption. If one is attached to getting recognition,praise, or other rewards from God or fellow congregants for one’s generosity,one is self-focused and will not receive the psychological benefits of movingout of one’s self-preoccupation.The path away from self-induced suffering is moving out of self-absorption, yet,in a tragic comedy, virtually the entirety of the modern mental healthprofession promotes self-focus. Psychiatrists’ most common treatment consists of“medication management” in which patients are directed to self-focus, as theyare asked questions solely about their symptoms so as to tweak their drugprescription. Even doctors who conduct “talk therapy” may direct emotionallysuffering people to become even more self-­focused. For Buddhist teachers, afocus solely on our symptoms and our feelings will only give them greater powerover us.Buddhist “therapy,” in contrast, consists of dialoguing with a person in a waythat pulls them out of self-absorption. This is most apparent in Zen Buddhism,which Smith tells us, “is a world of bewildering dialogues, obscure conundrums,stunning paradoxes, flagrant contradictions, and abrupt non-sequiturs.” Heoffers some examples: “An ancient master, whenever he was asked the meaning ofZen, lifted one of his fingers. That was his entire answer. Another kicked aball. Still another slapped the inquirer in the face.” The Zen therapist knowsthat without provoking us out of our ordinary consciousness, we will not be ableto see life differently.As is the case for anarchism, there are different schools of thought in Buddhismwith different emphases and differing ideas about therapeutic methods andtechniques. Chögyam Trungpa (1939–1987), Buddhist scholar, teacher and founderof the Naropa Institute, was a controversial figure for his personal drug andalcohol use, his sexual choices, and his provocative style. But Trungpa wassought after by the famous and non-famous for instructions on meditation. In hisThe Myth of Freedom and the Way of Meditation, Trungpa tells us, “Meditation isnot a matter of trying to achieve ecstasy, spiritual bliss or tranquility, noris it attempting to become a better person”; instead the goal is “to expose andundo our neurotic games, our self-deceptions, our hidden fears and hopes.” Thepurpose of mediation is greater enlightenment, including becoming “aware of ourawareness,” especially of those mental events that result in suffering.From the perspective of Buddhism, most mental health professionals are trainedto be out of touch with reality—to be psychotic and delusional—to the extentthat they are trained to view the causes of human suffering as chemicalimbalances and defective genes. To assert the true cause of human sufferingwould put professionals in conflict with oppressive hierarchies and a consumereconomy based on self-focus and attachments. And mental health professionalstend to comply with societal norms rather than rebel against them.The God of Spinoza and EinsteinWhen it came to religion in the 1950s and 1960s, Lenny Bruce was perhaps themost outrageously courageous Jew around, as he was unintimidated by authoritiesand paid a legal and career price for his words. In the 1650s and 1660s, themost outrageously courageous Jew was Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677), who soinfuriated Jewish religious authorities that they excommunicated him, and who soenraged a religious fanatic that he attacked Spinoza with a knife in anunsuccessful assassination attempt.The anti-authoritarian God of Spinoza can be more threatening to religiousauthoritarians than an atheist rejection of God. Religious authoritarians knowthat “Godless atheists” will have no influence over people who sense a forcethat is greater than they are; however, the anti-authoritarian God of Spinozaoffers a real alternative for them.The God of Spinoza is in no way the Biblical fatherly God who personallypunishes individuals and populations for disobedience and who rewards forcompliance. Spinoza’s God doesn’t have a “personality” and is in no way a“top-dog” in the hierarchy of life. Spinoza does not anthropomorphize God.The God of Spinoza, instead, includes all aspects of nature and the universe,including its finite and infinite aspects and all of its laws—physical,psychological, and otherwise. Human beings are part of nature but limited intheir capacity to understand all of nature. And thus Spinoza’s idea of Godcompels a humility in the sense that we may connect to some of God but that itis rationally impossible to connect with all of God. So for Spinoza, someone whoself-certainly claims to have God’s truth is arrogant and delusional.Philosophers debate whether Spinoza was a pantheist (God is all, and God and theuniverse are identical) or a panetheist (God is the soul of the universe,transcending the universe). However, there is no debate that the God of Spinozahas absolutely nothing to do with the God of Cecil B. DeMille’s The TenCommandments, whose God speaks with a deep powerful voice, gets pissed off, andcruelly punishes transgressors. Spinoza’s God is just way too cool to do thatkind of thing.Spinoza wrote, “The greatest good is the knowledge of the union which the mindhas with the whole of nature. . . .The more it understands the order of nature,the more easily it will be able to liberate itself from useless things.” To knowSpinoza’s God is to know the truth of nature, to know its laws, and how theuniverse functions. That’s why the anti-authoritarian scientist and humanitarianAlbert Einstein (1879–1955) believed in the God of Spinoza.“Einstein Believes in ‘Spinoza’s God’” was a 1929 headline in the New YorkTimes. In response to a public criticism by a Boston cardinal that Einstein wasa Godless atheist, Rabbi Herbert Goldstein sent Einstein a telegram asking him,“Do you believe in God?” Goldstein requested that he respond in 50 words butEinstein needed only 32: “I believe in Spinoza’s God, who reveals himself in thelawful harmony of all that exists, but not in a God who concerns himself withthe fate and the doings of mankind.”Just as religious authorities had accused Spinoza of being an atheist, Einsteinalso was similarly accused. In response to this atheist accusation, Einsteinresponded, “From the viewpoint of a Jesuit priest I am, of course, and havealways been an atheist.” Einstein called the idea of a personal God “a childlikeone.” However, Einstein rejected the “crusading spirit of the professionalatheist whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of liberation from thefetters of religious indoctrination received in youth.” Instead, Einsteinasserted, “I prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of ourintellectual understanding of nature and of our being.”“Einstein’s God,” concludes Einstein biographer Ronald Clark, “thus stood for anorderly system obeying rules which could be discovered by those who had thecourage, the imagination, and the persistence to go on searching for them.”Michael Gilmore, writing in Skeptic, concludes, “Einstein continued to search,even to the last days of his 76 years, but his search was not for the God ofAbraham or Moses. His search was for the order and harmony of the world.”Einstein’s view of God had pragmatic psychological value for him. Einsteinbiographer Walter Isaacson points out that for Einstein, a belief in somethinglarger than himself produced a mixture of confidence and humility. “Given hisproclivity toward being self-centered,” Isaacson concludes, “these were welcomegraces. Along with his humor and self-awareness, they helped him to avoid thepretense and pomposity that could have afflicted the most famous mind in theworld.”Spinoza studied optics and made lenses for telescopes and microscopes, and, likeEinstein, had an interest in all the laws of the universe. While Einsteinfocused mostly on the laws of physics, Spinoza was more of a psychologist,focusing more on the “mental laws” of human beings. Spinoza cared very muchabout what he called our “passions” and our emotions, which are part of ourhumanity and thus part of nature. For Spinoza, to sin, shame, or pathologize ouremotions and our passions would sin, shame, or pathologize an aspect of God.However, what was clear to Spinoza was that our passions and our emotions canbecome tyrannical forces, destructive to ourselves and others.Like Spinoza, Lenny Bruce realized that organized religion was in many ways anoppressive force, but had Bruce absorbed Spinoza’s great work, Ethics, he mighthave realized that so too could his own passions and emotions befreedom-depriving tyrants. To be controlled solely by one’s passions andemotions is to be incapable of wise judgments about ultimate consequences ofbehaviors. Like Bruce, Spinoza championed freedom and tolerance and opposed thetyranny and intolerance of political and religious authorities. But Spinoza alsoknew that we could tyrannize ourselves, making ourselves less tolerable toourselves and others.For Spinoza, one cannot be truly free if one is in bondage to one’s emotions. AsSpinoza scholar Joseph Ratner put it, the wise human being “does not madlysatisfy or repress one passion at the expense of the rest of his nature.” Ifonly one aspect of our humanity takes over, then the remainder of ourhumanity—including our intellect and our need for justice, community, wisdom,beauty, autonomy, and freedom—will suffer.Sinning, shaming, or pathologizing our emotions and passions actually gives themthe power to tyrannize us; while simply acknowledging them gives them theinfluence they merit, which is not the power to dominate and control but merelythe capacity to partially inform.Spinoza was not an ascetic. He simply had few material needs. He had a view ofhappiness in which fame or material goods would not provide him with joy. ForSpinoza, the incremental understanding of the universe, of nature, of life, andthus of God is the supreme source of happiness.Both Spinoza and the Buddha are very much psychologists who came to similarconclusions. Both taught how to gain freedom from self-induced tyrannicalattachments. And both practiced what they preached. There are otheranti-authoritarian views of God, or at least less authoritarian views than theGod of the Bible and the God of Cecil B. DeMille.Thomas Paine, like Spinoza and Einstein, was condemned as an atheist for hisattack on Christianity. However, Paine was not an atheist. After reflecting onreligion a good part of his life, he came to believe in deism, the belief in aGod that was the Cause or the Creator of the universe, not a God who interfereswith the universe. For deists, a universe created by God does not require anintervening God. Deism was actually the belief system of many Enlightenmentthinkers, including Benjamin Franklin and other so-called “founding fathers” butmost of them, more politically astute than Paine, did not widely publicize theseviews.Other anti-authoritarians are attracted to the God of Martin Buber (1878–1965).Buber’s God or Eternal Thou is found not by looking high up in the sky butwithin an I-Thou encounter. An I-Thou relationship may be between lovers,friends, strangers, or even between a person and a pet. In this I-Thouencounter, there is no using of the other in any way. In the I-Thou, there issimply an experiencing of the other, and this results in the experience of Godor the Eternal Thou. Buber recognized that life is not possible without someobjectifications or what he called I-It (e.g., cutting down a tree and using itto fuel a fire to warm oneself), so Buber does not shame or sin the I-It. ButBuber was troubled by a world that was increasingly entirely I-It and withoutI-Thou, and he famously said, “Without It, man cannot live, but he who liveswith It alone is not a man.”Some anti-authoritarians sense a divine force that can liberate humans fromsocial and economic injustices, and they selectively believe in only theanti-authoritarian aspects of the Bible. That would describe Harriet Tubman(profiled later), often called “Moses” for leading multiple slave escapes in themid-nineteenth century. Tubman believed in a God that told both Moses andherself to free their people, but she scorned the part of the Bible thatsanctioned slavery and promoted slave obedience. Similarly, Frederick Douglass(profiled later) espoused what today is called “liberation theology.” Douglassconfronted the hypocrisy of those who claim to be Christians but dishonor Jesusby their support of slavery.The EnneagramThe Enneagram is a lens by which people can better understand themselves andothers in a manner that is almost completely opposite from the way psychiatrycategorizes people. Unlike psychiatry and the DSM, in the Enneagram there is nolabeling pronouncements of “mentally healthy” and “mentally ill” people. LennyBruce’s comedian mentor Joe Ancis was known to say, “The only normal people arethe ones you don’t know very well,” and that is certainly the view of theEnneagram.When I first heard about the Enneagram—composed of nine interrelated personalitytypes—I reflexively rejected it. In my professional training, I had been exposedto not only the DSM but to several other classifying systems, and they allseemed unhelpful. It was ludicrous for me that mental health professionals, whothemselves didn’t seem all that together, were the people deciding who wasnormal and who was mentally ill. Psychiatrists and psychologists, more than thegeneral public, appeared to me to get a control buzz out of classifying people;but their control was illusory, as human beings are not consistent and have alarge range of potential behaviors. It seemed to me that putting people intoboxes caused a great deal of harm and did very little good.Thus, initially I had no interest in the Enneagram, and only by serendipity didI become intrigued by it. Three decades ago, a client demanded that I listen toaudiotapes about the Enneagram by a Franciscan friar, Richard Rohr. This felt soridiculous—to listen to one more personality system and this time fromclergy—that the utter preposterousness of the request made me chuckle andcomply. By luck, the tape was not completely rewound, and I began listening toit just as Rohr was matter-of-factly asserting that the nine “compulsions” ofthe nine Enneagram personality types included two compulsions that were omittedfrom the seven deadly sins (pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath andsloth). I was surprised that a Catholic priest would assert this “defect” in theseven deadly sins list, and I was curious as to what were the two omittedsins/compulsions that are included in the Enneagram. These omissions, Rohrannounced, were “deceit” including “self-deceit” and also “fear.” Then he added,“America is capable of immense deceit . . . . . America has to own its capacityfor deceit.” I had never thought it possible that a Catholic priest could in anyway be anti-authoritarian, and so I became curious about the Enneagram.What I like and respect most about the Enneagram is that it is decidedlynon-hierarchical. No doctor, researcher, clergy, guru, or any authority informsyou of your personality type. Typing only has value if it is you whoautonomously discovers it, and it only has value if you are brutally honest withyourself. It is easy to deceive others and yourself as to the true nature ofyour attachments and compulsions, and the Enneagram claims no scientificpretense that it can detect your deception. Typing yourself to be a personalitythat you’d prefer rather than who you truly are provides you with nothing—peoplewho are ignorant of the Enneagram couldn’t care less about your type, and peoplewho understand the Enneagram know that no type has more or less status than anyother.The Enneagram is an egalitarian system. Within the continuum of each type, it ispossible to bring ourselves and others both joy and suffering. In the Enneagram,every personality type has the potential to deteriorate, which, depending on thenature of one’s culture may be labeled as mental illness, criminality,adjustment, or success. And similarly, each personality type can transcend itscompulsions and create joy for themselves and others.Among the Enneagram’s recent well-known disseminators—Richard Rohr, HelenPalmer, and Don Richard Riso—all address the problem of how classificationsystems can neglect the uniqueness of the individual and disrespectfullypigeonhole people. But as Palmer notes, “The Enneagram . . . is not a fixedsystem,” as it allows for movement within our own personality type continuum andeven toward other types. To know another’s personality type does not mean onecan control or predict another’s behavior, because typing does not tell youwhether someone is transcending their compulsions or surrendering to them.The idea that human beings have a variety of temperaments based on thedomination of different ego attachments, passions, and compulsions rings truefor me. Any observer of young children sees that they have different innatetemperaments. I have found that the Enneagram rings true for manyanti-­authoritarians, including many adolescent anti-authoritarians, and itcreates a more satisfying and meaningful life for them. While scientificobjective validity in the area of personality may be illusory, the Enneagram ispragmatically valid for many anti-authoritarians.The descriptions of ONE through NINE personality types vary slightly amongEnneagram authors. Type ONE is called the “Reformer” or the “Perfectionist,”compelled to be morally right, fearful of condemnation. Type TWO is called the“Helper” or the “Giver,” compelled to being needed, and fearful of not beingloved. Type THREE is called the “Performer” or the “Motivator,” compelled to beseen as successful, fearful of failure and not being admired. Type FOUR iscalled the “Artist” or the “Individualist,” compelled to be unique, fearful ofbeing defective. Type FIVE is called the “Thinker” or the “Observer,” compelledto understanding and freedom, fearful of being overwhelmed by others. Type SIXis called the “Loyalist” and the “Doubter,” compelled to have security andcertainty, fearful of abandonment and insecurity. Type SEVEN is called the“Generalist” or the “Epicure,” compelled to fun and pleasure, fearful ofdeprivation. Type EIGHT is called the “Leader” or the “Boss,” compelled toself-reliance and power, fearful of submitting to others. Type NINE is calledthe “Peacemaker” or the “Mediator,” compelled to union with people and thenatural world, fearful of conflict. The number does not in any way signify anyone type being superior to any other; but the numbers are significant in that,for example, the TWO is adjacent to both the THREE and ONE, and so the TWO haselements of ONE and THREE as well.Within any Enneagram type, there is a wide continuum of behavior. Take typeFIVE, the “Thinker.” At their most transcendent best, the FIVE accuratelyobserves the world, makes perceptive connections, and generates profoundinsights. The FIVE can also be a one-dimensional intellectual analyzer and aboring professor. And a deteriorated FIVE can become so fearful of humanattachments that this leads to becoming reclusive and making intellectualconnections based more on fears than on reality, resulting in becoming paranoid,delusional, impulsive, erratic, and even violent. System creators such as BaruchSpinoza, Albert Einstein, and Noam Chomsky appear to me as part of the FIVEgroup, but so too does Ted Kaczynski.I say “appear to me” because we cannot be certain of the true personality typeof others. We can easily mistype others based on how they appear which may notbe who they really are. We should be wary of certainty when it comes to typingfamous people, yet typing their public persona is one way of conveying theEnneagram and learning it. My apologies to Spinoza, Einstein, Chomsky, andKaczynski if they are not FIVES—they just appear to me to be in my FIVE group.The Enneagram offers a psychologically pragmatic way of transcending our egoattachments and compulsions. When we type ourselves, we are recognizing ourimbalances of being too dominated or too devoid of an aspect of humanity, and soa path for balance and wholeness becomes quite clear. Returning to the FIVE whois compelled to observe, think, and analyze: the Enneagram does not shame orpathologize observing, thinking, and analyzing but instead informs the FIVE thatif the FIVE has the courage to move outside one’s head and engage the world, theFIVE will have more accurate observations and thus more superior insights. Forall Enneagram types, if they transcend compulsive pursuits—and acquire a senseof humor about them—they will be rewarded with what they care most about.Anti-authoritarians exist among each personality type, though, given their type,their anti-authoritarianism plays out very differently. Whether any type becomesan anti-­authoritarian who challenges and resists illegitimate authority isdetermined by an array of many variables that includes luck and choice. Becauseof the subjective, unmeasurable, and indeed mysterious nature of the variablesthat determine one becoming an anti-­authoritarian, scientific prediction is notpossible. This is good news for anti-authoritarians, because if powerfulauthoritarians could scientifically predict anti-authoritarians throughpersonality typing or genetic testing, they would try to eliminate them.The Enneagram is similar to the teachings of the Buddha and Spinoza in that allthese lenses are concerned with how we create suffering for ourselves and othersby being enslaved by our ego attachments, passions, and compulsions. But theEnneagram is actually more satisfying for me in helping myself and others breakloose from our self-enslavements because the Enneagram takes the next step.While all human beings have the general problem of being enslaved by egoattachments, passions, and compulsions, the Enneagram helps us understand how weare dominated by different ego attachments, passions, and compulsions."},{"pageContent":"10: LESSONS FROM ANTI-AUTHORITARIANS WHO HAVE HELPED THEMSELVES AND THE CAUSECounterculture Beacons: Henry David Thoreau and Scott Nearing / Two-StrikeHitters: Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and Helen Keller / Modern Models:Jane Jacobs, Noam Chomsky, and George CarlinThe following anti-authoritarians who have helped themselves and theanti-authoritarian cause have experienced various degrees of assault byauthoritarians but for the most part have not assaulted themselves. Theseanti-authoritarians would most likely admit that luck is certainly a factor inpreventing a tragic life, but they also took advantage of opportunities thatcame their way.These anti-authoritarians used their unique talents to the fullest. They alsorecognized the importance of relationships, specifically having mutuallyrespectful and affectionate ones. None of them were broken by their standardschooling. Some of them were self-taught or educated outside of a standardschool; others quit school; and others fought off the ill effects of schooling.Overwhelming pain is the fuel for self-destructive behavior and violence, sowise reductions of pain—financially, interpersonally, and in one’s physicalhealth—are crucial for surviving and thriving. All of the followinganti-authoritarians were committed to enjoying life, though some of their ideasabout fun are uncommon ones.None of the following anti-authoritarians are perfect because no person isperfect. While this group models some admirable characteristics, their livesalso include hypocrisies, inconsistencies, and less admirable traits. However,it would be a mistake to dwell only on their imperfections and lose the wisdomand energy that their triumphs provide.Counterculture Beacons: Henry David Thoreau and Scott NearingHenry David Thoreau and Scott Nearing are “off-the-grid” and “back-to-the-land”legends. They provide great lessons for anti-authoritarians who dream of escapefrom authoritarian society. While I’ve long shed my romanticized image ofThoreau and Nearing, I’ve also discovered that most who knew them had affectionand respect for them despite their shortcomings.Henry David ThoreauDuring his lifetime, Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) was not completely unknownoutside of his hometown Concord, Massachusetts, but nowhere near as famous as hewould become after his death. Today, Thoreau has worldwide fame for his essay“Civil Disobedience” (originally titled “Resistance to Civil Government”). Inthat essay, Thoreau challenged the authority of government that forces people toignore their conscience and then to support unjust institutions.Thoreau’s refusal to pay a tax was a resistance to supporting the U.S.government’s war with Mexico and the expansion of slavery; and for his taxresistance, he was briefly jailed. Unlike most Americans, including evenabolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison, Thoreau supported John Brown whenhe was captured and later hanged. Thoreau also disobeyed the Fugitive Slave Actof 1850 by participating in the Underground Railroad, assisting runaway slaveson their way to Canada, including providing them with money.Thoreau is a beacon for countercultural anti-authoritarians for many reasons. Tosay that he was a naturalist is an understatement. He was in love with nature.He modeled simple living and self-reliance and was an early critic ofconsumerism. He was an advocate of preserving the wilderness and theenvironment, and he celebrated recreational canoeing and hiking. For what hemodeled and advocated, Thoreau was seen as eccentric by much of his contemporarysociety.As a young man, Thoreau (born David Henry Thoreau) went to Harvard, graduated,taught, and famously exited to the woods for two years. In contrast to TedKaczynski’s tragic ­victim-victimizer existence and isolation, Thoreau’s lifewas filled with reciprocal support from friends and family members. WhileThoreau praised solitude, he nurtured relationships, showed great loyalty, andenjoyed his travel companions. Thoreau had fun—this an important but too oftenneglected aspect of his life.Thoreau famously observed, “The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.What is called resignation is confirmed desperation.” Thoreau did notromanticize rural living: “From the desperate city you go into the desperatecountry, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats.”He saw despair everywhere, “concealed even under what are called the games andamusements of mankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after work.”Thoreau knew the importance of having a good time. While authoritarians wouldrather remember Thoreau’s self-denial of material luxuries and his rejection ofalcohol, coffee, and almost all beverages except water, Thoreau was notessentially an ascetic any more than the Buddha or Spinoza. All desired the goodlife, their version of it.Thoreau biographer Walter Harding, in The Days of Henry Thoreau, tells us thatin 1837, there were four roads open to a college graduate such as Thoreau—theministry, law, medicine, or teaching. Thoreau, at age 20, chose teaching, but itdidn’t take him long to get in trouble with authorities, as he was reprimandedfor not using corporal punishment to keep his classroom quiet. Thoreau’s way ofdramatizing the preposterousness of this demand was to gratuitously whip severalsurprised students and then immediately resign. This kind of rebellion madesense for the immature Thoreau, but obviously not for his students.After a short period of working in the Thoreau family ­pencil-making business(where he added useful innovations), Henry and his brother John opened up theirown school in 1838. The Thoreau brothers’ school was noted for its innovations,devoting a considerable part of its program to field trips, including frequentwalks in the woods where Henry would excite the children’s interest in botanyand animals. Other field trips included farms, boat repairers, and gunsmithshops. Henry purchased surveying instruments and introduced it into thecurriculum as a practical way to make math come alive. Surveying not onlystimulated his students, but ultimately Henry became proficient enough to havean alternative way to make a living after John’s tragic death in 1842, whichended the Thoreau brothers’ school.As a young adult, Thoreau became friends with Ralph Waldo Emerson, who was awell-known public intellectual during this era. Emerson introduced Thoreau toother unconventional and eccentric writers and thinkers in the Concord,Massachusetts, community. Some in this group struggled financially, includingBronson Alcott, the father of Louisa May Alcott, and Ellery Channing, who wouldbecome perhaps Thoreau’s best friend and often travel companion. Thoreau livedin the Emerson household from 1841 to 1844, serving as a tutor for Emerson’schildren and also a handyman and gardener.Thoreau had a sense of humor, though his brand of humor sometimes rattledfriends. Later in Thoreau’s life, when his former jailer Sam Staples bought someland adjacent to Emerson, Staples asked Thoreau to survey it. Thoreau broughtStaples and Emerson together to announce that Emerson’s hedge was several feetover on Staples’s property, that Emerson had been stealing land for years, andthat he was happy to be able to disclose Emerson’s dishonesty. Then with Emersoncompletely embarrassed, Thoreau finally let out a laugh, making it clear that hehad been pulling Emerson’s leg.A 26-year-old Thoreau’s embarrassing mistake might interest anti-authoritarianswho beat themselves up for imperfect fidelity to nature. Returning to Concordfrom a trip, Thoreau and his friend Edward Hoar accidentally set a fire thatdestroyed 300 acres of Walden Woods. I’ve known many anti-authoritarians who areso ashamed by mistakes far smaller than Thoreau’s that they can move into adepression or into substance abuse and remain there for decades. Thoreau quicklymoved on.In 1845, shortly before turning 28, Thoreau began his legendary experiment onthe shore of Walden Pond, living for two years in a small simple home that hebuilt. Thoreau famously tells us in Walden, “I went to the woods because Iwished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and seeif I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discoverthat I had not lived.” Actually, Thoreau was not all that removed fromcivilization, as his family home was approximately one and a half miles away.Walden certainly celebrates the joys of solitude and connecting with nature.However, Thoreau does mention visitors, and actually had a regular stream ofthem. While Thoreau was an individualist and critic of conformity, he does notmodel social isolation. To raise the roof for his Walden cabin, Thoreau’s crewincluded Emerson, Alcott, Channing, and other friends, as well as his favoriteConcord farmer Edward Hosmer and three of Hosmer’s sons. And Harding reports,“The children of Concord were always happy to go out to Walden Pond and Thoreauwas equally happy to have them,” as he would take them on nature walks. Onechild would later recount, “He could lead one to the ripest berries, the hiddennest, the rarest flowers, but no plant life could be carelessly destroyed, nomother bird lose her eggs.”While Thoreau mocked material luxuries, he clearly loved the luxury of travel,alone or with companions. In 1839, Henry and his brother John built a boat, andthey took a trip on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers to the White Mountains, andHenry would return there with Edward Hoar in 1858.In 1837, Thoreau first toured Maine. He returned there in 1846 (leaving hiscabin on Walden Pond for a while), connecting with his cousin in Bangor andjoined by two of his cousin’s friends for a camping trip to Mount Katahdin. In1853, he came back to the Maine woods, this time joined by a Native Americanguide Joe Aitteon. And in 1857, with Hoar, Thoreau again journeyed to the Mainewoods, hiring Native American guide Joseph Polis. Polis showed Thoreau, who wasalready a skilled canoe paddler, how to be even better. Thoreau was impressed inmany ways by Polis, and he would later write, “The Indian, who can find his wayso wonderfully in the woods, possesses so much intelligence which the white mandoes not,—and it increases my own capacity, as well as faith, to observe it.”Thoreau’s brief life included several other trips and excursions. In 1843, hestayed with Emerson’s brother in Staten Island. In New York City, he madewriting contacts and hung out with Emerson’s transcendental communityacquaintances. And in 1856, he returned to the New York City area, hanging outwith Bronson Alcott who introduced him to Walt Whitman. Whitman had beencriticized by others for publishing a private letter from Emerson praising him,but Thoreau cut slack to Whitman for his self-­promotion, and later he calledWhitman a “great fellow” and praised his Leaves of Grass. Whitman spoke of othermeetings with Thoreau, and it is possible they might have reconnected again in1858 when Thoreau briefly returned to the New York City area.Cape Cod was a frequent destination for Thoreau. In 1849, Thoreau and Channingtraveled there. Thoreau returned to Cape Cod by himself in 1850, returned withChanning in 1855, then again alone in 1857. Thoreau also traveled to Canada withChanning in 1850. And in 1861, Thoreau along with the son of educator HoraceMann, went to Minnesota. The Minnesota trip was taken in large part to helpimprove Thoreau’s health, but it failed. Thoreau died from tuberculosis in 1862at age 44.For modernists who focus only on Walden and on selective quotes, as did KathrynSchulz in her 2015 New Yorker article “Pond Scum: Henry David Thoreau’s MoralMyopia,” they may ask as Schulz asked, “Why, given his hypocrisy, sanctimony,and misanthropy, has Thoreau been so cherished?” Schulz calls Thoreau:“self-obsessed: narcissistic, fanatical about self-control,” and depicts him as“adamant that he required nothing beyond himself to understand and thrive in theworld.” She describes Walden as the “original cabin porn: a fantasy about rusticlife divorced from the reality of living in the woods, and, especially, afantasy about escaping the entanglements and responsibilities of living amongother people.”Hypocrisy is certainly there in Walden, as Thoreau was in no way removed fromcivilization, so close to his mother and sister that they routinely brought himcookies. But in response to Schulz, Jedediah Purdy’s “In Defense of Thoreau”noted that while she was right that Ralph Waldo Emerson did say, “I love Henry,but I cannot like him,” Schulz excluded other Emerson reflections about Thoreauthat give us a fuller and kinder picture of him. Emerson also said Thoreau was aman who “threw himself heartily and childlike into the company of young peoplewhom he loved, and whom he delighted to entertain, as only he could, with thevaried and endless anecdotes of his experiences by field and river.”Schulz also accused Thoreau of having “no understanding whatsoever of povertyand consistently romanticized it,” offering as evidence Thoreau’s quote:“Farmers are respectable and interesting to me in proportion as they are poor.”Yet I have known financially struggling farmers who have used that exact Thoreauquote for comfort, preventing them from acting on suicidal thoughts as theirbills overwhelm them. Moreover, Purdy points out, “Emerson noted that farmerswho hired Thoreau as a surveyor usually started out treating him as an oddity,but ended by admiring him.”Walden, for Schulz, makes Thoreau appear to be a selfish jerk, but the personalThoreau, while eccentric, was actually generous with both his funds and time.Thoreau financially helped out his more impoverished friends and gave money tocauses. And Purdy reminds us, “Thoreau took a genuine interest in the lives ofNative Americans, too, seeking them out for long conversations at a time whenthis was unusual.”For modern anti-authoritarians, the life of Henry David Thoreau provides severallessons: making a buck with various skills; living within one’s means; nurturingrelationships despite social clumsiness; loyalty to friends; cutting slack tohis fellow anti-authoritarians—and having fun.Scott NearingIn certain “sustainable-living” circles, Scott Nearing (1883–1983) is as much ofa beacon as is Henry David Thoreau. Nearing lived to be 100 years old, the last50 of those years as a prophet and model—along with his wife Helen—forback-to-land homesteaders who sought escape from Western civilization and longedfor a simple and meaningful “good life.”Like Thoreau, Nearing was also socially awkward. In order to become a nationallyknown public speaker, Nearing recounted, “It meant conquering bashfulness,overcoming stage fright, reducing self-consciousness to a minimum.” LikeThoreau, Nearing had little regard for ordinary social niceties, as HelenNearing (1904–1995) recounted about Scott, “He abhorred gossip and small talk,avoiding commonplace trivia . . . he was not an easy or avid conversationalist.”Both Thoreau and Nearing were socially quirky and clumsy and at times obnoxious,yet both elicited admiration and affection from anti-authoritarians who knewthem. Like Thoreau, Nearing abstained from alcohol, coffee, and many consumergoods. And both liked to travel, with Nearing traveling even more widely thandid Thoreau.Scott Nearing grew up in a wealthy household. In 1903, at age 20, he decided tomake teaching his profession, ultimately acquiring a PhD in economics. He taughtat the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business but becameincreasingly outspoken about the cruelties of capitalism, including its childlabor practices, and he was fired in 1915. His dismissal was seen by manyAmericans across the political spectrum as a serious breach of academic freedom;it made Scott Nearing a national public figure, a victim of academicauthoritarianism. Nearing found another teaching post at the University ofToledo, but after he spoke out against the U.S. government’s entry into WorldWar I, he was fired again in 1917. At that point, his academic career “lay inruins,” he later recounted, “my experience and competence as a professionalteacher were brushed aside.”A serious young man, Nearing became even more serious, “Beginning with the warof 1917–18,” he recalled, “I deliberately stopped introducing any form of humoror lightness into my talks . . . . I no longer tried to ingratiate myself withaudiences or with the organizations sponsoring the lectures.”Nearing joined the Socialist Party in 1917 and authored several pamphlets,including The Great Madness: A Victory for the American Plutocracy, for whichhe was indicted by the U.S. government under the Espionage Act. However,Nearing, unlike many others so prosecuted, had greater luck and was notconvicted in his 1919 trial. In 1927, Nearing joined the Communist Party, but in1930 he was expelled from it for contradicting Leninist dogma. Estranged fromLeft political parties, his academic career destroyed, Nearing had alsoseparated from his first wife.Marginalized and disillusioned, Nearing later recounted that as long as hecontinued to speak out, “I would be cut off from the country’s major channels ofpublicity. No more of my articles would appear in newspapers or magazines norwould my books be reviewed in them. No more books would be published byrepresentative publishers. I would be excluded from the lecture platform. Mostimportant of all to me, the academic field would be closed tight.”Nearing had little choice but to cut a different path, “I decided to continue asa freelance teacher, to talk and write as opportunity offered. In the meantime,how to live? . . . Many of my friends and associates on the Left who stayed trueto the cause, drove trucks for a living, served milk routes, delivered papers,worked as waiters or stevedores, or drove taxies. I chose homesteading as a wayof life under United States right wing pressure in the 1930s.”In 1932, a 49-year-old Nearing, along with his new partner, 29-year-old HelenKnothe (whom he later married) purchased land in rural Vermont. In 1954, Scottand Helen Nearing published Living the Good Life about their then approximatelytwo-decade experiment in homesteading. They proudly reported that they hadsucceeded in restoring depleted mountain land so as to grow vegetables, fruits,and flowers; had done so organically without chemical fertilizers; created asubsistence homestead; had a small-scale successful business enterprise, a maplesugar “cash crop”; maintained excellent health, with neither needing to see adoctor for two decades; simplified their lives; were able with six months a year“bread labor” to have six months a year of leisure time for research, travel,writing, and speaking; and fed and lodged many people who stayed with them fordays, weeks, or longer.When ski resorts and developers intruded on their Vermont homestead, Scott, atage 69, and Helen decided to start over. They relocated their homesteading toCape Rosier, Maine, again calling it “Forest Farm,” replacing maple sugar withblueberries as their cash crop. In addition to vegetable growing and othertypical homesteading activities, Scott deepened a pond by shoveling outthousands of wheelbarrow loads of mud, built a stone wall around his largegarden, and in his early nineties was mixing cement for the Nearings’ new stonehouse.With the Nearings’ Good Life books (that would include Continuing the Good Life:Half a Century of Homesteading), they became legends. “The Nearings becamecounterculture celebrities in the 1970s,” writes historian and philosopher JohnFaithful Hamer in his article “The Forest Farm Romance.” The Nearing homesteadbecame a sacred place for thousands of young people who would make theirpilgrimage there—some just to gawk but others who the Nearings would feed andput to work. Scott once again had his students, and he was in his glory. Many ofthese young people were so inspired by the Good Life books and by Forest Farmthat they embarked on their own homesteading attempts. They reasoned that ifScott could begin homesteading at age 49, start over again in Maine at age 69,and could be making it work for another three decades, then certainly with hardwork, they too could also succeed.However, in their popular Good Life books, the Nearings were not candid abouttheir sources of income. In Scott Nearing’s 1972 autobiography The Making of aRadical, he does tell us that he had an insurance annuity, a minimum monthlysocial security check, a modest trust fund left by his sister, and another trustfund left to him by a Boston friend which he used to contribute money to hisfavorite causes. However, many young hopeful homesteaders were ignorant of theserealities, and plunged in with only their hard work and enthusiasm.In the late 1960s and 1970s, the Nearings began to sell off—quiteinexpensively—significant acreage from their large tract to young homesteaders.In Meanwhile, Next Door to the Good Life, Jean Hay Bright, one of the recipients(along with her then partner Keith), makes clear that she continues to havegreat respect for what the courageous and hardworking Nearings accomplished, andshe maintained her friendship with them until their deaths. However, it troubledHay Bright that the Nearings were not completely candid with the public abouteconomic realities. Although the Nearings did grow much of their food, workedhard, and were frugal, it was their outside income and other people’s labor thathelped make their lives sustainable.Another land recipient was Eliot Coleman; and his daughter Melissa, as an adult,wrote about her childhood with her homesteading parents living next to theNearings. Melissa Coleman notes, “Helen was known to have a soft spot forexotics like avocados, bananas, and Florida oranges, which she had shipped toMaine, but as they didn’t support the self-sufficiency stance, these wereconveniently not mentioned in their books.”The Nearings’ reported that they spent only four hours a day on “bread labor”survival, enabling them to spend four hours a day on intellectual pursuits andfour hours a day on socializing, and that they traveled six months a year.However, as Stanley Joseph—who also acquired property from theNearings—tragically discovered, this kind of good life is impossible withoutadditional income. After the end of Joseph’s marriage to his homesteadingpartner Lynn Karlin, Joseph, alone facing the hard realities of homesteading,committed suicide in 1995.Self-promotion by anti-authoritarians, so to survive and thrive, is not rare.The Nearings’ self-promotion of self-­sufficiency—especially given their ageswhen they accomplished this—was what provided them with celebrity status. ForScott, given his banishment from his beloved teaching profession, young people’sattention had to be exhilarating; he not only had students again but awe-struckones. Self-promoting U.S. anti-­authoritarians have existed in many walks oflife. Not only did the poet Walt Whitman publish Emerson’s personal letter forpositive publicity, he anonymously published his own highly flattering review ofhis poetry collection Leaves of Grass.Despite Scott Nearing’s less admirable traits, even his greatest detractorswould acknowledge that he was stubbornly persistent, hardworking, resilient, anddedicated. Despite the hypocrisies, there are many important lessons to belearned from Nearing’s life, including how he dealt with his anger.Scott Nearing clearly asserts his anger about the direction of the UnitedStates, and one also senses his anger about the ruin of his academic career andthe sellout of many U.S. leftists. Nearing did not use that fuel of anger tokill enemies (as Leon Czolgosz and Ted Kaczynski had) but instead as energy toprove his enemies wrong and prove the value of his way of life, and to seizeattention and respect from his detractors’ children and grandchildren. However,Scott Nearing was very human, and though he mostly used anger as fuel for hisworthy achievements, it leaked out elsewhere in psychologically destructiveways. People could be made to feel inferior by Scott for not living up to hismoral standards. Also, there was Scott’s relationship with his son John (fromScott’s first marriage). Scott cut John out of his life because of John’smainstream political views and lifestyle, not returning John’s letters and notattending John’s funeral.Scott did maintain his relationship with his other son and many other people,though he had no really close relationships with anyone except Helen. Scott’sbest decision was partnering with Helen. As a young woman, Helen had been anaspiring musician and bohemian who was charmed by charismatic older men (priorto Scott, Helen, in her late teens, had been emotionally intimate with thephilosopher and self-help guru Jiddu Krishnamurti). Helen was a perfect partnerfor Scott because Scott needed a woman who would both compliment and complementhim. Helen wrote in her memoir that “my life for more than fifty years wasScott-centered. . . . There were times . . . when he had to poke or pull mealong toward his own rare intense level of dedication.” It is clear that theNearings had deep mutual affection, however, as Melissa Coleman observed, thoughthe Nearings were progressive in their teachings, “the Nearings’ marriage wasrooted in an earlier era.” Coleman recounts that, “Once, when Helen interruptedScott during a particularly long ramble, he cut her off by saying, ‘Quiet,woman.’ The younger onlookers were scandalized, but it didn’t faze Helen.”For anti-authoritarians who long to escape Western civilization, there are manylessons to be learned from Scott Nearing’s life. His self-taught survivalskills, self-discipline, and resilience were self-promoted virtues but werevirtues that he truly possessed. Not self-promoted was his anger, and though hewas far from perfect in how he channeled it, he did use it positively in manyways.The “good life” that the Nearings promoted is mostly true and genuinelyinspiring, but there is also much to be learned from the imperfections of lives.In both my research and my personal experience, I have discovered realitiesabout those who have failed and succeeded in some kind of off-the-grid escape.Without some outside “passive income,” or a spouse with some mainstream job thatprovides at least a modest income, or some other concession to the moneyedeconomy, one cannot likely make it—even with twelve hours a day of labor ratherthan four “bread labor hours.”Henry David Thoreau and Scott Nearing are deservedly beacons foranti-authoritarians who dream of escape from authoritarian society. And foroff-the-grid anti-authoritarians who need to let go of their shame aboutimperfections, the realities of Thoreau and Nearing’s entire lives areinstructive.Two-Strike Hitters: Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and Helen KellerBeing an anti-authoritarian in the United States means having one strike againstyou. Having a second strike against you—as Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubmanhad being born slaves, and as Helen Keller had becoming deaf and blind at 19months of age—makes the margin for error all the more narrow. Douglass, Tubman,and Keller knew that to have any chance at all, they had to use their talents tothe fullest and take advantage of every opportunity.Douglass, Tubman, and Keller have each achieved an almost mythical status, somuch so that their flesh-and-bones humanity has been lost. Unfortunately, theirlives have been used by authoritarian society to instruct Americans that anyonewho perseveres can overcome any obstacle—a message that is untrue and insultstheir legacies.Frederick DouglassFrederick Douglass (approximately 1818–1895) questioned the authority of theslavery system as a young boy, asking, “Why am I a slave? Why are some peopleslaves and others masters?” As he grew up, he challenged and resisted thissystem. He first psychologically emancipated himself from a slave mentality,then escaped from slavery, then fought for the abolition of slavery, and afterits abolition continued to fight for full human rights for African Americans.Douglass (born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey) began life as a slave onthe Eastern Shore of Maryland, relatively fortunate in that he lived close tonon-slave states. As a young child, Douglass was sent from a rural plantation toBaltimore, and he later recounted, “I regard my removal from Col. Lloyd’splantation as one of the most interesting and fortunate events of my life. . . .[I]t is quite probable that but for the mere circumstance of being thus removed,before the rigors of slavery had fully fastened upon me; before my young spirithad been crushed under the iron control of the slave-driver; I might havecontinued in slavery until emancipated by the war.”In Baltimore, the relatively kind wife of his master assisted young Frederick inlearning the alphabet. He took full advantage and continued to learn to readfrom white children around him as well as from the writings that he came intocontact with; and even when he was ultimately forbidden to read, he secretlypursued reading and writing. This would make all the difference, as he woulddiscover writings that confirmed his instinct that slavery was wrong.With his growing knowledge, he became increasingly resistant to his slavestatus, and ultimately got sent to “rehab,” which consisted of being sent to afarmer who had a reputation of being a “negro-breaker.” The teenage Frederickwas regularly whipped and almost psychologically broken. He concluded that if hewas broken, he might as well be dead, and he took a risk. He physically foughtback against the farmer, and this ended his abuse. Later he recalled thatfighting back “revived a sense of my own manhood. I was a changed being afterthat fight. I was nothing before; I was a man now. . . . I had reached the pointat which I was not afraid to die. This spirit made me a freeman in fact, thoughI still remained a slave in form.” Douglass considered himself lucky that hisresistance did not result in him being handed over to authorities and hanged.Psychologically astute, he intuited that the negro-breaker was ashamed of hisdefeat and did not want it to be known, as such a defeat would affect hisreputation as a negro-breaker.Douglass’s initial attempts at escape failed but he remained resilient. In 1838,his well-thought-out escape was a successful one with the help of Anna Murray,whose parents had been freed before her birth and so she had been born free inMaryland. Anna Murray was five to six years older than Frederick, and she wasexceptionally entrepreneurial with her laundry service. The two may have firstmet when her laundry work took her to the Baltimore docks where Frederick wasworking. Using her income, Anna was able to financially aid Frederick for hisescape. Frederick changed his last name to avoid capture, and Anna followed himto New York City where they wed, eventually having five children together andremaining married for 44 years until her death.After living for a short period in New York City, Douglass moved to New Bedford,Massachusetts. He joined anti-slavery groups and made alliances with fellowformer slaves and white abolitionists, connecting with perhaps the most famousU.S. abolitionist, William Lloyd Garrison, who encouraged Douglass. At age 23,Douglass began his life as an abolitionist orator, initially as a nervous novicebut quickly becoming one of the most powerful speakers in U.S. history.In 1845, at the age of 27, Douglass published the first version of hisautobiography (which he twice revised), and he became something of a celebrity.This publicity made him a marked man for recapture. Not naively believing thathis new fame would be an antidote to authoritarian assault, he fled the UnitedStates in 1845. In England and Ireland, Douglass was emotionally moved by therelative absence of racial discrimination. He became a popular lecturer andremained overseas for two years, impressing British philanthropists who raisedfunds to buy his legal freedom so he could return to the United States withoutfear of recapture.Douglass was the consummate networker. He recognized the parallels of thewomen’s rights movement with the slave abolition movement, and in 1848, Douglassattended the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women’s rights convention in theUnited States. He connected with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and used his newspaper,the North Star, to push for women’s rights. Douglass would later have politicaldisagreements with Stanton, but they remained friends.After John Brown’s Harpers Ferry raid in 1859, Douglass again evidenced hispolitical astuteness about U.S. “justice.” Even though Douglass had opposed theraid for strategic reasons, he was cynical about being exonerated frominvolvement in the raid and again fled the United States, first to Canada andthen to England. He later recounted, “I knew that if my enemies could not proveme guilty of the offense of being with John Brown, they could prove that I wasFrederick Douglass; they could prove that I was in correspondence and conspiracywith Brown against slavery; they could prove that I brought Shields Green, oneof the bravest of his soldiers, all the way from Rochester to him atChambersburg; they could prove that I brought money to aid him, and in what wasthen the state of the public mind I could not hope to make a jury of Virginia[which Harpers Ferry was then part of] believe I did not go the whole length hewent, or that I was not one of his supporters; and I knew that all Virginia,were I once in her clutches, would say ‘Let him be hanged.’” Douglass knew thathe would not get a fair shake and that remaining in the United States would onlyserve to allow authorities to shut him up.With the beginning of the Civil War, Douglass helped recruit for the 54thMassachusetts Infantry Black regiment, and he used his hard-earned politicalcapital to push Abraham Lincoln for greater rights for African Americans.Following the war, Douglass, who had become politically well-connected, receivedseveral job offers. He became president of the Freedman’s Saving Bank, Chargéd’Affaires for the Dominican Republic, U.S. marshall for the District ofColumbia, recorder of deeds for the District of Columbia, and minister to Haiti.He continued to be widely sought as a speaker, and, with income from his writingand speaking and these job positions, Douglass not only gained financialsecurity but could afford in 1877 to buy a large house in Washington DC (whichhe expanded).After Anna Murray Douglass died in 1882, Frederick Douglass in 1884, at age 66,married Helen Pitts, a white suffragist twenty years his junior. Douglass hadachieved such stature in both white and black America that despite the greatcontroversy that his second marriage created, he continued to thrive. From 1886to 1887, Douglass and his second wife took a year-long tour of Europe and theMiddle East. At age 77, in 1895, Frederick Douglass died.Throughout his life, Douglass recognized opportunities and took full advantageof them. As an adolescent, he was psychologically astute, and as a young man, hewas resilient in the face of failure. He acquired money-making skills andfinancial wisdom. He valued physical and mental effort but also fully recognizedthe importance of relationships. He showed his appreciation for kindness,respected those who respected him, and formed relationships with people who hadinfluence and money.Douglass was also way ahead of his time in recognizing the power of images topromote both himself and dignity for African Americans. He became enamored byphotography, writing extensively about it. And after achieving fame, in order tocounter the racist images of African Americans, he became the most photographedperson in the United States in the nineteenth century. He was well aware that hewas the most famous black man in the United States and of the importance ofconveying an image of strength and dignity.While aggressively promoting full human rights for African Americans, Douglasswas in some ways less radical than his mentor abolitionist William LloydGarrison. Their falling out was in part because Garrison had long declared theU.S. Constitution to be pro-slave and thus needed to be abolished, and Douglasscame to oppose that view. Douglass favored the annexation of Santo Domingo bythe United States and was clearly not a socialist or anarchist. However,Douglass was a triumphant anti-authoritarian who challenged and resisted whitedomination of himself and of all African Americans.Harriet TubmanHarriet Tubman (approximately 1822–1913), like Frederick Douglass, was born intoslavery and eventually escaped. Even Douglass was awed by Tubman’s courage. Itwas daring enough for a slave to attempt escape, but to return to slaveterritory several times to help other slaves escape was courageous in theextreme. Tubman, unlike Douglass, never had the opportunity to learn how to readand throughout her life she had to deal with the effects of a head injury(caused by a slave owner) that resulted in dizziness, pain, seizures, and sleepdifficulties. Tubman’s triumphs so transcend her circumstances that she appearsalmost as an unreal superwoman character. Thus, few Americans reflect upon therealities of her life.Tubman (born Araminta “Minty” Ross), like Douglass, started life enslaved on theEastern Shore of Maryland. Her severe head injury occurred in early adolescencewhen she was struck by a heavy metal weight thrown by her master intending tohit another slave. In her early twenties, she married John Tubman, a free blackman, and soon after she also changed her first name to Harriet. Despite herhusband being free, Harriet remained a slave.Tubman went up for sale in early 1849, but luckily she had been ill, and therewere no buyers. Later that year, despite her husband’s attempts to dissuade her,she escaped with her brothers Ben and Henry, who then forced her to return withthem. Shortly after, she escaped again without her brothers. Returning later forher husband, she discovered that he had remarried and had no desire to leave, soshe used the trip to help other slaves escape. In Tubman’s abolitionistfundraising, she would tell the story about her husband’s refusal to leave so asto get a laugh and a donation. In 1854, she returned to rescue Ben and Henry, aswell as a third brother, Robert, their wives, some of their children, and otherslaves, taking them to Canada because of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.The precise number of slave-rescue trips and number of slaves whom she freed iscontroversial. Based on the claims of Tubman’s initial biographer Sarah Bradford(Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman, 1869; Harriet Tubman, Moses of HerPeople, 1886) monuments honoring Tubman routinely state that she freed more than300 slaves in 19 trips. What recent biographer Kate Clifford Larson discoveredwas that Tubman in the late 1850s told audiences that she had rescued 50 to 60people in eight or nine trips. Larson concludes that Tubman directly helpedapproximately 70 to 80 slaves escape in 13 trips, and that Tubman had also giveninstructions to help another approximately 60 slaves escape.Tubman was extraordinarily brave but not arrogant, as she restricted her rescuetrips to the Maryland area that she knew. Larson notes, “Tubman depended on hergreat intellect, courage and religious faith . . . . She followed rivers thatsnaked northward, and used the stars and other natural phenomena to guide her.She relied on sympathetic people, black and white, who hid her, told her whichway to go and connected her with other people she could trust. She woredisguises. She paid bribes.”Tubman did not create the Underground Railroad but used the network effectively.Though Tubman couldn’t read, she knew what days of the week that newspapersprinted runaway notices, and so she began escape trips on Saturday evening,knowing that the notice wouldn’t be printed until Monday, providing her with ahead start. Tubman also carried a revolver for two reasons: protection againstslave catchers and their dogs, and to threaten to shoot those who she wasrescuing if they wanted to turn back (as this endangered the remainder of thegroup).Tubman’s fame, historian Eric Foner notes, spread quickly in abolitionistcircles, “By the late 1850s, she had become known as the slaves’ ‘Moses’. . . .Nonetheless, Tubman struggled to raise money for her undertakings. She worked inPhiladelphia, New York, and Canada as a laundress, housekeeper, and cook, andsolicited funds from abolitionists. On one occasion, she camped out in theanti-slavery office in New York City, asking visitors for donations.”Harriet Tubman gave direct assistance to John Brown for his 1859 raid at HarpersFerry, as upon Brown’s request, Tubman gathered former slaves who were willingto join his raid. Then in 1860, in Troy, New York, Tubman was involved in therescue of a fugitive slave, freeing him from the custody of U.S. marshals.With the advent of the Civil War in 1861, Tubman aided the Union army as a cook,nurse, scout, and spy for Union forces in Hilton Head, South Carolina. Then, in1863, Tubman became the first woman to plan and lead an armed raid during theCivil War. The raid freed 700 slaves from several plantations along the CombaheeRiver. The raiders, who included 300 black soldiers, also burned severalbuildings and crops and either captured or destroyed stockpiles of munitions andfood. The Wisconsin State Journal printed a story about the raid andacknowledged Tubman’s important role, “A Black She ‘Moses’—Her Wonderful Daringand Sagacity,” and described the raid as “striking terror to the heart ofrebellion.”After the Civil War, Tubman returned to her home in upstate New York. Prior tothe war, Tubman had purchased a home and land on the outskirts of Auburn, NewYork, from William Seward, at that time an abolitionist U.S. Senator from NewYork, who gave Tubman extremely favorable terms. Auburn was a significantabolitionist stronghold, and Seward and his wife were participants in theUnderground Railroad. In 1869, Tubman married Nelson Davis, an African AmericanCivil War veteran who was approximately twenty years her junior. She haddifficulty getting government compensation for her war contributions, but shedid receive financial assistance from the profits of Sarah Bradford’s biographyabout her.Tubman’s survival instincts and her physical strength were astonishing, but evenshe did not win every encounter. In 1873, financially vulnerable, Tubman and herbrother were scammed by two con artists, who beat her and robbed her of $2,000of an investor’s money that she had raised.Continuing to farm her seven-acre property, she and Davis ran a smallbrick-making business in the 1880s before he died in 1888. In the 1890s, Tubmanbecame more involved in the women’s suffrage movement. In 1896, she purchased 25acres near her property, which she ultimately transferred to the AME ZionChurch. And in 1908, she opened the Harriet Tubman Home for Aged and InfirmNegroes—a dream of hers. She died in 1913.Tubman survived and triumphed because of her intelligence, her relationships,and her almost superhuman physical courage. William Still, a fellow AfricanAmerican abolitionist who would chronicle the Underground Railroad, said thatTubman “seemed wholly devoid of personal fear.”That her fearlessness came from her religious beliefs is uncontroversial. Tubmanspoke about “consulting with God,” and she had complete confidence that Godwould keep her safe. The abolitionist Thomas Garrett reported that he “never metwith any person, of any color, who had more confidence in the voice of God, asspoken direct to her soul. . . . and her faith in a Supreme Power truly wasgreat.” For Tubman, Larson concludes, “the root of her outbursts, visions,sleeping spells, and voices” lay in her powerful faith. Given her visions andthe voices that she heard, it is a good thing that Tubman only had to watch outfor slave catchers and not modern psychiatrists.Many anti-authoritarians see religion as the “opiate of the masses,” lockingpeople into passivity and compelling them to wait for the “pie in the sky whenthey die.” But for people such as Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and HelenKeller, their religious faith informed and inspired their anti-authoritarianspirit. For people with two strikes against them, logic may tell them to giveup, but faith can empower them, energized by a belief that they are chosen by asupreme being to lead their people out of oppression. For Tubman, her faithhelped fuel what modern psychiatrists would call hallucinations. Labelingvisions or voices as a symptom of illness is an arrogant assumption, as thereare many reasons why this phenomenon occurs. One reason is that when humanbeings experience extreme oppression, such visions and voices can be the onlyantidotes to psychological powerlessness.Helen KellerThere is a wide gap between what most Americans are taught about Helen Keller(1880–1968) and the truth of her life. Keller was a member of the SocialistParty, an enthusiastic supporter of her hero Eugene Debs’s presidentialcandidacy, a leading women’s rights and civil rights activist, a critic of WorldWar I, and one of the founders and board members of the American Civil LibertiesUnion.“The mythological Helen Keller that we are familiar with,” notes KeithRosenthal, “is little more than an apolitical symbol for perseverance andpersonal triumph.” Rosenthal points out in his article “The Politics of HelenKeller” that one of the most problematic moral messages that Keller’s life isused for is to promote the idea “that the task of becoming a full member ofsociety rests upon one’s individual efforts to overcome a given impairment andhas nothing to do with structural oppression or inequality.” That frustrated andenraged the real Helen Keller.The mythical Keller is a version of the “American Dream” of pulling oneself upby one’s bootstraps, overcoming limitations, and becoming socially andeconomically successful. This version of Keller has created resentment with manyindividuals with disabilities who know full well the truth of being disabled inthe United States, and Keller also grasped this truth. While Keller enjoyed theattention and influence that her fame provided, she was frustrated by how onepart of her was used to advance the American Dream mythology while her life as asocialist who confronted American injustice was quieted and marginalized.Helen Keller lost both her sight and her hearing due to illness when she was 19months old. This resulted, as she tells us in her autobiography, in her becomingextremely frustrated and angry. She also describes herself as a domineering(with her playmate Martha) and mischievous child: “One morning I locked mymother up in the pantry. . . . She kept pounding on the door, while I satoutside on the porch steps and laughed with glee as I felt the jar of thepounding. This most naughty prank of mine convinced my parents that I must betaught as soon as possible.” Fortunately, the young deaf-and-blind Helen was notviewed by her parents as also having oppositional defiant disorder or hopelesslyin need of institutionalization.Keller was lucky to have parents with some wherewithal. Helen’s mother had readabout the successful education of another deaf-and-blind child, Laura Bridgman,and this put the Keller family on a path to connect with Alexander Graham Bell,who worked with deaf children. Young Helen adored Bell, and Bell recommendedthey seek help from the Perkins Institute for the Blind in Boston, where Helenconnected with Anne Sullivan, a graduate of the institute. In 1887, Sullivanwent to Keller’s home in Alabama and began working with Helen, and this began a49-year relationship between them. Keller recounted in her autobiography, “Themost important day I remember in all my life is the one on which my teacher,Anne Mansfield Sullivan, came to me.” Throughout her life, Keller would connectwith other helpful people, who “hitched their wagon” to Helen because of herintelligence, drive, and determination, which made it clear that theirassistance would not be a waste of time.The description of Anne Sullivan as “the miracle worker” was actually firstcoined by Mark Twain who came to know Helen in 1895 when she was 15. Kellerlater recounted about Twain, “He treated me not as a freak, but as a handicappedwoman seeking a way to circumvent extraordinary difficulties.” When Helen wasten, she began speech classes at Horace Mann School for the Deaf in Boston andthen she attended the Wright-Humason School for the Deaf in New York City,improving her communication skills including her speaking ability. She thenattended the Cambridge School for Young Ladies in Massachusetts, a preparatoryschool for women. When Twain met her, he was amazed by Helen’s “quickness andintelligence” and he pushed the wealthy Henry H. Rogers to fund Helen’s furthereducation. Rogers, equally impressed, paid for her to attend Radcliffe College,where she was accompanied by Sullivan who assisted Helen with lectures andreadings. Keller, at age 24, graduated with honors.Prior to graduating Radcliffe, Keller had published her first autobiography, TheStory of My Life. Already well known, her autobiography propelled her intobecoming even a greater celebrity. In her later life, she would be known as aninternational ambassador for the United States. However, most Americans areunaware of Helen Keller’s radical politics.In 1909, at age 29, Keller joined the Socialist Party of America. Keller waspassionate about social and economic justice. She later recounted, “Step by stepmy investigation of blindness led me into the industrial world.” She discoveredthat the leading causes of disability in the United States were an economicsystem in which profits were prioritized over preventing diseases and workplaceaccidents. She concluded that “our worst foes are ignorance, poverty, and theunconscious cruelty of our commercial society. These are the causes ofblindness; these are the enemies which destroy the sight of children and workmenand undermine the health of mankind.”Keller was very public about her socialism. She was an enthusiastic proponent ofthe revolutionary Industrial Workers of the World. In the early twentiethcentury, with her fame, Keller became a leading figure in the U.S. socialistmovement, using her platform to publicize and support the major strikes of herera. Predictably, the same newspapers that had celebrated Keller’s triumph overher disabilities then used her disabilities as a way to dismiss her politics andto persuade readers not to take her socialism seriously. Keller later recounted,“So long as I confine my activities to social service and the blind, theycompliment me extravagantly . . . but when it comes to a discussion of a burningsocial or political issue, especially if I happen to be as I so often am, on theunpopular side, the tone changes completely.”Socialist ideals of equality and social and economic justice fit into Keller’s“disability politics.” While Keller fought for expanded educational andvocational opportunities for people who were deaf, blind, and with otherdisabilities, she was far more radical. As Rosenthal documents, “She maintainedthat the larger problem was the existence of a society that did not properly fitall of its members . . . that the issue was not exclusively one of people withdisabilities versus people without disabilities, but rather all of the exploitedand oppressed (including disabled people) versus a form of society that . . .subjugated the former as a precondition for the wealth and power enjoyed by adominant fraction of that society.” Keller wanted to build bridges between alloppressed and exploited people.Helen Keller was human and thus imperfect, as one biographer Kim Nielsen makesclear in The Radical Lives of Helen Keller. Like many of us, our hypocrisiesarise out of our need to financially survive, and in Keller’s case, also theneed to maintain some political influence. So while Keller originally rejectedfinancial support from Andrew Carnegie, who patronizingly threatened to lay heracross his knees and spank her so she would “come to her senses” aboutsocialism, she later accepted a Carnegie pension. In her role as spokespersonand fund raiser for the American Foundation for the Blind, for which shereceived a salary, she allowed the AFB to control her message so as to ignoreher political radicalism. Keller was imperfect elsewhere. Like many other birthcontrol activists, including Margaret Sanger, Keller supported some eugenicideas though she never went as far as to support forced sterilization. And likeScott Nearing and many American socialists, she remained a supporter of theSoviet Union for several years after it was clear to anarchists such as EmmaGoldman and Alexander Berkman that the Soviet Union was a totalitarian society.Harriet Tubman and Helen Keller both saw themselves as chosen by a supreme beingto lead people out of oppression. In an interview she gave at age 36, Kellerstated, “I feel like Joan of Arc at times. My whole [being] becomes uplifted. I,too, hear the voices that say ‘Come,’ and I will follow, no matter what thecost, no matter what the trials I am placed under.”Both Frederick Douglass and Helen Keller published memoirs in their twentiesthat made them “stars” of their respective oppressed groups. And while therewere Americans who doubted that a runaway slave or a deaf-blind person couldhave written such intelligent books, many other Americans were awed by whatDouglass and Keller had overcome. Their awesomeness gave them a platform to bespokespeople for their groups but also made it politically difficult to be fullhuman beings; and both rebelled against not only the inferior status of theirgroup but also against one-dimensionality ascribed to them.To the extent that anti-authoritarians enter the political realm, they findthemselves in compromising positions. Frederick Douglass knew that there was notenough political support for women’s voting rights and that if women’s votingrights were included in the proposed 15th Amendment to the Constitution, theamendment wouldn’t pass; and that would mean that male African Americans wouldcontinue not having voting rights. And so to the dismay of his allies in thewomen’s rights movement, Douglass opposed the inclusion of women’s voting rightsin this amendment. Similarly, Keller was routinely in the position of beingmarginalized in her human rights fight for disabled people to the extent thatshe included her full socialist agenda, and so she compromised herself there.Anti-authoritarians who choose to enter the realm of political activism willeventually be put in the position of compromising some of their integrity. Ofcourse, anti-authoritarians can refuse to compromise, but they will likely pay aprice in terms of personal and political marginalization. Historically, both thecompromising and uncompromising political paths have had value in differentcircumstances.Modern Models: Jane Jacobs, Noam Chomsky, and George CarlinAnti-authoritarians Jane Jacobs, Noam Chomsky, and George Carlin challengedillegitimate authority in a straightforward and accessible manner. All threeexpressed contempt for standard schooling and its assault on self-learning andcritical thinking. All three exuded a certainty—without superiority—thatcommunicated: “Just forget about what the authorities with their academiccredentials and official badges are telling you. I see this. What do you see?”The truths that Jacobs, Chomsky, and Carlin saw and asserted have been powerfulchallenges to authoritarian society, but perhaps even more threatening forauthoritarians is their modeling of an unbroken human being.Jane JacobsJane Jacobs (1916–2006) was an astonishingly triumphant anti-authoritarian inseveral respects. First, lacking any academic credentials in urban planning andwithout even a college degree, her book The Death and Life of Great AmericanCities became one of the most influential challenges in U.S. history to policiesthat were devastating U.S. cities. Second, while viewing herself as primarily awriter, Jacobs ultimately became one of the most successful activists in recentU.S. history, leading and winning fights against one of the most powerful andintimidating authorities in New York City history. And third, while elitistauthorities had tried to marginalize her as “just a housewife,” her marriage wasa key to her success in several areas. Her partnership with her husband wascritical to her professional successes, and after raising three childrentogether, Jane and Robert Jacobs had the wherewithal to save their sons from theviolence of the U.S. government.Jane Jacobs (born Jane Butzner) started life in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Herancestors came from “old Protestant stock” who had arrived in America before theRevolutionary War. Her father, John Butzner, was a highly respected physicianwho, like Ralph Nader’s father, encouraged his children to think for themselves.When she was nine years old, Jane recalled a teacher telling the class thatcities always grow up around waterfalls; and though Scranton had a waterfall,young Jane didn’t think that waterfalls were the critical factor, “Mines werethe thing in Scranton. I was very suspicious.” So Jane immediately told herteacher that she was wrong.Winning battles with teachers, biographer Alice Sparberg Alexiou concludes,“only served to increase her already-healthy self-esteem.” In one incident whenJane was seven years old, a teacher told the class to raise their hands andpromise to brush their teeth every day for the rest of their lives; but Jane’sfather just the previous day had told her never to promise to do anything forthe rest of her life when she was still a child because promises are serious. SoJane not only refused to raise her hand but told her classmates not to do so aswell. This enraged Jane’s teacher, who threw her out of the classroom. However,the undaunted Jane exited school and enjoyed herself, wandering along somerailroad tracks. Jane was a mischievous child, “a free spirit, clever,hilariously funny and fearless,” recounted a Scranton newspaper columnist whoknew her when they were both children.Alexiou notes, “Jane did just enough work to pass her courses but no more. . . .By the time she got to the third grade, she discovered that she could readanything and thereafter tuned out her teachers. All her life, she would remain avoracious reader.”Her parents, notes New Yorker writer Adam Gopnik, “indulged their daughter’seccentricities, clearly seeing them as part of her character, her ‘spunk.’” Herupbringing allowed her to believe, Gopnik concludes, “that authority could belaughed away, a powerful notion for a provocateur to take through life.”When Jacobs graduated high school, her parents told her that they had the moneyto send her to college but she recalled, “I was so damn glad to get out ofschool I couldn’t even think of going to college.” Jacobs aspired to be anewspaper reporter, but she took a stenography course so as to support herselfand moved to New York City with her sister. With her stenography skills, shesupported herself as a secretary and explored New York City, and began lovingcities as much as Thoreau loved nature. She discovered Greenwich Village andmoved there with her sister.In 1938, at age 22, Jacobs gave higher education a try. She enrolled at ColumbiaUniversity School of General Studies as a non-matriculating student, takingwhatever course she wanted and received good grades. After two years, she wasrequired to matriculate, but was rejected by Barnard despite her good record atColumbia because of her poor high school grades. Jacobs claimed later that thiswas a blessing; and she would have, as Alexiou put it, a “lifelong disdain forformal schooling.”In the 1940s, Jacobs worked as a reporter for the State Department and OverseasInformation Agency magazine Amerika. In 1944, she met Robert Jacobs and marriedhim shortly later. In 1947, when their peers were moving out to suburbs, Janeand her architect husband bought an old rundown three-story building inGreenwich Village, and there they had three children together between 1948 and1955.In 1956, shortly before turning 40, Jacobs gave a speech that changed her life.The Architectural Forum, for whom she was writing, asked her go to HarvardUniversity to speak at a conference on urban design. She first refused as shehated public speaking. “It was a real ordeal for me,” she later said. But herspeech made complex ideas simple, especially about how people use space. Shetalked about how city planners and architects imposed their ideas of order thatwere oppressive to people’s freedom to interact. Her impressed audience includedinfluential people, such as Lewis Mumford, architectural critic for the NewYorker, and William Whyte (author of The Organization Man), who at the time wassenior editor of Fortune and who facilitated a piece by Jacobs for Fortune in1958. This ultimately connected Jacobs with Random House editor Jason Epstein,resulting in a book deal for The Death and Life of Great American Cities, whichshe published in 1961.The Death and Life of Great American Cities would become and remain one of themost influential books about cities and urban planning in U.S. history. Jacobsbegan it with this sentence: “This book is an attack on current city planningand rebuilding.” In her first paragraph, using the word attack three times,Jacobs makes clear that she opposed the “principles and aims that have shapedmodern, orthodox city planning and rebuilding.” “I shall mainly be writing aboutcommon, ordinary things,” Jacobs proclaimed, about what kind of streets are safeand unsafe, why slums stay slums or regenerate, and “how cities work in reallife.” She had contempt for elitist ideologues who don’t observe realities ofcity life such as the harmful effects of high-rise housing projects and highwaysthat gut cities. She coined terms such as “mixed primary uses” and “eye on thestreet.”Jacobs would later say, “It is not easy for uncredentialed people to stand up tothe credentialed, even when the so-called expertise is grounded in ignorance andfolly.” Many authorities tried and failed to marginalize the book and dismissJacobs as merely a “housewife” or an “amateur.” Readers were taken by hercommonsense ideas, powerful prose, and her obvious love of cities. Theanti-authoritarian Jacobs told us to form our own conclusions, “I hope anyreader of this book will constantly and skeptically test what I say.” Herdisdain for dogma and ideology coupled with her pragmatism made the book freshand exciting. Jacobs’s work emerged in an era of anti-authoritarian womenwriters, most famously Rachel Carson (Silent Spring, 1962) and Betty Friedan(The Feminine Mystique, 1963).Jacobs had become a community activist even before The Death and Life of GreatAmerican Cities, but she became more known after that book’s publication. Herprimary adversary was Robert Moses, the epitome of an authoritarian. Moses, interms of construction—roads, bridges, parks, and housing—was the most powerfulfigure in New York City history. Documented by Robert Caro’s 1974 book The PowerBroker, Moses had once been lauded as a reformer and city improver, but Caronotes, “To clear the land for these improvements, he evicted the city’s people,not thousands of them or tens of thousands but hundreds of thousands, from theirhomes and tore the homes down. Neighborhoods were obliterated by his edict.”Moses’s political acumen and power was such that no mayor or governor daredoppose him; and even when Franklin Delano Roosevelt, at the height of hispopularity as president, attempted to oppose Moses, Caro tells us that Roosevelt“found himself forced to retreat.” But Jane Jacobs stood up to Robert Moses andwon.Prior to her fame as an author, Jacobs had in the late 1950s joined the fightagainst a Moses project to put a roadway through Washington Square Park inGreenwich Village, linking Fifth Avenue with West Broadway. Jacobs and othersformed a community group, which was uncommon at the time. Instead of pleadingwith city bureaucrats and with Moses, they used public pressure to intimidatevulnerable politicians. When Moses realized that he had been defeated, he becamelivid and transparent, “There is nobody against this—nobody, nobody, nobody, buta bunch of, a bunch of mothers!”Another Moses project, more potentially devastating, was the Lower ManhattanExpressway (LOMEX), which if built would have wiped out SoHo, Chinatown, LittleItaly, and much of Greenwich Village. Jacobs recounted, “I felt very resistantto getting into another fight. I wanted to work on my work.” But with her newclout, Jacobs knew that she was invaluable to the movement and jumped in,leading another diverse community group that included artists, business owners,homemakers, reform Democrats, right-wing young Americans for Freedom, andanarcho-pacifists. They defeated LOMEX in 1962, but as Jacobs would later say,“The rule of thumb is that you have to kill expressways three times before theydie.” This was the case with LOMEX. In its last defeat in 1968, at a publichearing on the project, Jacobs got arrested on several charges includinginciting a riot, but luckily she avoided jail.Not long after that in 1968, Jane and Robert Jacobs took their family and movedout of the United States to Toronto, Canada. The Vietnam War was the majorreason. The Jacobs family were anti-war activists. Following one anti-wardemonstration at the Pentagon in which soldiers drove back protesters with riflebutts injuring many, though Jane was unhurt, she recalled thinking, “I didn’tfeel part of America anymore.” Moreover, Jane and Robert’s sons were draft ageand had announced that they would go to jail rather than Vietnam. And so facedwith their sons’ likely imprisonment, Robert and Jane, like Frederick Douglassand Harriet Tubman before them, sought refuge in Canada. But unlike Douglass andTubman, the Jacobs family did not return. Jane continued as an activist inToronto and became one of Canada’s most honored and influential citizens. Shedied in 2006, shortly before her 90th birthday.Like Scott Nearing, one of Jane Jacobs’s best decisions was her spouse choice.Throughout their lengthy marriage, Robert complimented and complemented Jane.They discussed all the ideas that went into her books, with Jane noting aboutThe Death and Life of Great American Cities, “I do not know which ideas in thisbook are mine and which are his.” They also teamed on every civic battle, withJane relying on Robert’s political savvy. Jane later said, “He usually stayed inthe background, and I don’t think people realized how important he was to allthe fights in Greenwich Village.” Robert in turn said, “I know that my wife ismore eminent than I am. I’m proud of that and I am so proud of her.”Money always matters, and early on Jane was self-reliant with her stenographyskills that kept her financially afloat until she could make it as a writer. Butfor Jane to have both professional and domestic satisfaction, Robert wasinvaluable. Alexiou notes, “Robert had a long and productive career as anarchitect, which is fortunate because Jacobs’s books were not of the sort thatmakes their writer wealthy.”Jacobs prided herself as being opposed to dogma, and she accepted thepossibility that there could be downsides to her vision. She had championedpreserving older buildings, not simply because of their architectural characterbut because she believed that this would ensure affordable housing. However,rehabbed older buildings such as hers led to gentrification (in the 2000s, herold Greenwich Village home would sell for $3 million), and this resulted in adecline of economic diversity.Jane Jacobs was no great diplomat, and she was lucky that this didn’t hurt herpolitical activism. For example, the influential Lewis Mumford had been anencouraging support for her, helping Jacobs following her Harvard talk. Jacobsand Mumford agreed on many urban issues—from their mutual antipathy for RobertMoses, to their agreeing on the disaster of high-rise housing projects, urbanexpressways, and urban renewal destruction. However, in The Death and Life ofGreat American Cities, Jacobs attacked Mumford in some areas, compelling acounterattack by Mumford in his review of her book. But when it came time tobattle Moses and LOMEX at a city hearing, upon her request, Mumford wrote whatJacobs called a “wonderfully effective letter” in opposition. She laterrecounted, “Nobody could have exerted the influence that he did.”In addition to The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jacobs would authorseveral other books, and at age 88, the anti-authoritarian Jacobs reminded herreaders, “I don’t want disciples. I want people with independent minds to readmy books.”Noam ChomskyNoam Chomsky (born 1928) may well be the most famous and admired modern U.S.anti-authoritarian. Given his political stands, it is remarkable that he hassurvived and thrived. In the early 1960s, Chomsky challenged and resisted theU.S. government’s war in Vietnam at a time when very few Americans werecriticizing the Vietnam War, risking an academic career in linguistics in whichhe had become highly esteemed for his groundbreaking contributions. Since hisentrance on the political public stage, Chomsky has used his platform tochallenge illegitimate authorities, including the U.S. government and oppressiveregimes around the world. He has voiced a consistent contempt for elite rule—forits atrocities as well as for its subversion of working-class autonomy.Amazingly, in a 2013 Reader’s Digest poll of “The 100 Most Trusted People inAmerica,” Chomsky, a self-described anarchist, was voted #20 (behind #19Michelle Obama; in front of #24 Jimmy Carter).Chomsky grew up in Philadelphia. His father, William, fled the Ukraine to theUnited States, worked in sweatshops, attended Johns Hopkins University, workedas a school principal, and later became one of the world’s foremost Hebrewgrammarians and faculty president at Gratz College. Noam’s mother Elsie was alsoa teacher. Chomsky describes his parents as “normal Roosevelt Democrats,”although some other family members were leftist radicals.Noam was seen as an exceptionally intelligent child in his community. BeaTucker, who worked as William Chomsky’s secretary, recalled a conversation withNoam at age seven. Tucker pointed to Compton’s Encyclopedia and asked Noam if hehad looked through any of the volumes, and Noam responded. “I’ve only read halfof them.” Between age two and twelve, Noam went to Oak Lane, a Deweyiteexperimental school where children were encouraged to think for themselves andwhere creativity was more important than grades. All schools, Chomsky believes,could be run like Oak Lane but won’t because no society “based on authoritarianhierarchic institutions would tolerate such a school system for very long.”At Oak Lane, when he was ten, Noam published an article in the school newspaperabout the fall of Barcelona to fascist forces during the Spanish Civil War—aninfluential event for Chomsky then and throughout his life. Later as a teenager,Noam read Homage to Catalonia, George Orwell’s account of the Spanish Civil Warand the briefly successful anarchist society in Spain. Chomsky’s earlyunderstanding that people can rise up against oppressive systems and createcooperative organization among themselves became part of the basis for hisbelief in anarchism as a real possibility.At age twelve, Noam entered Central High School in Philadelphia, a highlyregarded school but one that he hated, “It was the dumbest, most ridiculousplace I’ve ever been, it was like falling into a black hole or something. Forone thing, it was extremely competitive—because that’s one of the best ways ofcontrolling people. So everybody was ranked, and you always knew exactly whereyou were. . . . All of this stuff is put into people’s heads in various ways inthe schools—that you got to beat down the person next to you, and just look outfor yourself.”Noam remained in school but recalled losing all interest in it. Instead, heself-educated during his adolescence. At age 13, Noam commuted alone by train toNew York City to visit relatives. He spent many hours with an uncle who ran anewsstand in Manhattan on 72nd Street, which was a lively “literary politicalsalon” where Noam was exposed to radical politics and Jewish working-classculture.At age 16, Chomsky began undergraduate studies at the University ofPennsylvania, but he soon became discouraged. He recalled, “When I looked at thecollege catalogue it was really exciting—lots of courses, great things. But itturned out that the college was like an overgrown high school. After about ayear I was going to just drop out and it was just by accident that I stayed in.”He recalled later, “The vague ideas I had at the time were to go to Palestine,perhaps to a kibbutz, to try to become involved in efforts at Arab-Jewishcooperation within a socialist framework” (in 1953, he did live for six weeks ina left-leaning kibbutz but was disappointed by racist attitudes there). In 1947at age 19, he began dating Carol Schatz, whom he would marry, and they wouldhave three children together. Also in 1947, Noam met Zellig Harris, acharismatic linguistic professor, which resulted in Noam remaining inacademia—and ultimately becoming a renowned linguist.His biographer Robert Barsky concludes, “Chomsky’s early life, indeed his wholelife, was and has been literally consumed by a desire for understanding and apenchant for political commitment.” Chomsky’s early interests were political,not linguistic. Chomsky recalled, “I had, from childhood, been deeply involvedintellectually in radical and dissident politics, but intellectually.”Ultimately, intellectual involvement was not enough. Chomsky tells us, “I’mreally a hermit by nature, and would much prefer to be alone working than to bein public.” However, some instinct told him that he needed to transcend hiscomfort zone and actively engage the world.One of the earliest influential authorities Chomsky challenged was behavioristpsychologist B. F. Skinner. Skinner’s 1957 book Verbal Behavior, with its viewthat language was learned through behavior modification, was for Chomskypatently absurd, denying a fundamental characteristic of humanbeings—creativity. And in 1971, with many other humanists, Chomsky confrontedthe totalitarian nature of another popular Skinner book, Beyond Freedom andDignity.While Chomsky was bothered by irrational notions in linguistics, he was enragedby illegitimate authority in the political realm, especially when it came to theVietnam War. Chomsky recounted, “I knew that I was just too intolerablyself-­indulgent merely to take a passive role in the struggles that were thengoing on. And I knew that signing petitions, sending money, and showing up nowand then at a meeting was not enough. I thought it was critically necessary totake a more active role, and I was well aware of what that would mean.” For tenyears, Chomsky refused paying a portion of his taxes, supported draft resisters,was arrested several times, and was on Richard Nixon’s official enemies list.Given the potential consequence of his political stand, Noam and Carol Chomskyagreed that it made sense for her to return to school and get a PhD so she couldsupport the family if he was put in prison. He later recounted, “In fact, thatis just what would have happened except for two unexpected events: (1) the utter(and rather typical) incompetence of the intelligence services. . . . [and] (2)the Tet Offensive, which convinced American business that the game wasn’t worththe candle and led to the dropping of prosecutions.” Carol Chomsky ultimatelysecured a position at Harvard’s School of Education, and went on to have asuccessful academic career. And so with luck and wise choices, the Chomskyfamily had two excellent incomes and financial security.Chomsky continued his public attack on authoritarian policies and propaganda. In1988, Chomsky and co-author Edward Herman published Manufacturing Consent, whichdescribes a “Propaganda Model” of how the media creates a distorted view ofreality that maintains the status quo for the ruling class.Given Chomsky’s many hours on the road speaking about political causes, his manypublications, and his extensive work on linguistics, he is mistakenly viewed asleading a life of self-­denial. However, he has long realized that to deny hisfull humanity—his need to have security, fun, and family—and to attempt ethicalperfection would be unhelpful. Chomsky is clear: “Look, you’re not going to beeffective as a political activist unless you have a satisfying life.” Chomskytells audiences, “None of us are saints, at least I’m not. I haven’t given up myhouse, I haven’t given up my car, I don’t live in a hovel, I don’t spend 24hours a day working for the benefit of the human race, or anything like that. Infact, I don’t even come close . . . . I certainly do devote an awful lot of myenergy and activity to things that I just enjoy, like scientific work. I justlike it, I do it out of pleasure.”In a 2003 New Yorker profile of Chomsky, Larissa MacFarquhar notes, “In manyways, he and his wife, Carol, lead a conventional middle-class life. They livein Lexington, Massachusetts, a Boston suburb, in a large brown clapboard house .. . . When their children were little, they went on vacations to the Caribbean;they summer on Cape Cod.” MacFarquhar quotes a Chomsky friend: “He likes to beout of doors in the summer, he likes to swim in the lake and go sailing and eatjunk food.”Chomsky models an activist who does not self-­flagellate about financialhypocrisies that are virtually impossible to avoid. When employed by theMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Chomsky was candid about the reality thateven though the U.S. government’s Department of Defense was not funding himdirectly, because the DOD was funding other MIT departments, such fundingallowed MIT to pay him. “As far as the moral issue goes,” Chomsky remarked,“It’s not as if there’s some clean money somewhere. If you’re in a university,you’re on dirty money—you’re on money which is coming from people who areworking somewhere, and whose money is being taken away.”Chomsky also realized that valuing family meant not only financial compromisesbut even an occasional philosophical one. Chomsky, a non-practicing Jew and nota member of any synagogue, was faced with a dilemma when his oldest daughterwanted to get bat-mitzvahed but was unable to do so because her family did notbelong to a synagogue; Chomsky relented and became a member. Carol, prior to herdeath in 2008, said, “Noam will always stop whatever he’s doing and do somethingwith the family. He is totally devoted. It’s his outlet.”In the area of electoral politics, Chomsky has recommended voting under certaincircumstances for the lesser-of-two-evil candidates, which for some on theradical Left is seen as a violation of integrity, but which he sees as rationaland politically astute. However, in one now infamous incident—the so-calledFaurisson affair—Chomsky chose not to be politically astute.Specifically, Robert Faurisson was a professor of French literature who had beensuspended from a university in France because of his denials of the Holocaust.Chomsky, at the request of a friend and because of his belief in free speech,signed a petition in 1979 for Faurisson’s free speech rights, and Chomsky alsowrote a longer statement about this case (that was used without Chomsky’spermission in a book by Faurisson). By taking this position on Faurisson,Chomsky created a distraction for his views about Israel. Regarding Israel,Chomsky has spoken of having had “a feeling of joy” about the initial creationof Israel as “a place where Holocaust victims could be assimilated”; but he hasalso expressed that just as the United States should not be a Christian stateand just as Pakistan should not be an Islamic state, Israel should not be aJewish state, and that all its inhabitants should have equal civil rights andpolitical say. For Chomsky’s ideological commitment to free speech in theFaurisson affair, he provided those who wish to discredit him as a “self-hatingJew” with material to manufacture propaganda against him.As we see with all anti-authoritarians, nobody has perfect wisdom, but NoamChomsky may come as close to Spinoza-like rationality as possible. Chomsky’sanger over illegitimate authority certainly has leaked out in debates, but forthe most part he has not self-sabotaged. Pained enough over illegitimateauthorities, he has not added to that pain any self-flagellations aboutunavoidable hypocrisies; and he has made sure to include joy in his life. He waswise with his choice of a spouse, and together they were smart with respect tomoney. Importantly, he has been wise to grow out of his hermit-like comfort zoneand engage the world—so as to not simply flee the repulsive elite but to alsoconnect with the non-elite.George CarlinIn ranking George Carlin (1937–2008) as the second best stand-up comic of alltime, Rolling Stone called him: “The hippie sage, the MIT-level linguist, theFirst Amendment activist, the undisputed champion gadfly of stand-up.” Like theactual MIT linguist Noam Chomsky, Carlin was fascinated by language. Like JaneJacobs, Carlin prided himself on being a writer. Jacobs, Chomsky, and Carlin—allvery different personalities with very different career paths—radiated aconfidence about challenging and resisting the illegitimate authorities ofsociety.George Carlin, as Rolling Stone, put it, “was the ultimate thinking man’s comic,demanding that his audiences fight from underneath the mountain of bullshitheaped upon them by clergymen, politicians and advertisers.” Carlin’s career arcwas a radical transformation, beginning as a “people pleaser” in the 1960s, thena counterculture hero in the 1970s, and finally in the last two decades of hislife, an anti-authoritarian prophet.In his autobiography Last Words, Carlin tells us, “I was conceived in a damp,sand-flecked room of Curley’s Hotel in Rockaway Beach, New York.” And so whileit’s difficult to disagree with Rolling Stone’s #1 best stand-up-comic rankingof the anti-authoritarian Richard Pryor, I’m a little more drawn to Carlin, inpart because he was conceived in Rockaway Park, a couple of miles west of whereI grew up (a happier Rockaway connection for me than Phil Ochs hanging himselfin Far Rockaway, a couple of miles to the east).Born in Manhattan, George’s parents separated when he was still an infantbecause, as Carlin put it, his father “drank, he got drunk, he hit people.”Carlin never met his father, who was for a time a successful salesman andafter-dinner speaker. George grew up in the ethnically diverse Manhattanneighborhood of Morningside Heights, raised by a single mother who was anexecutive secretary in the advertising business.Growing up, George had a great deal of freedom and autonomy. At age seven, hesnuck on the subway to visit his mother at work, and went downtown to CentralPark, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Wall Street, Chinatown, and thewaterfront. By age eleven, he knew he wanted to be an entertainer as he lovedthe laughter and attention, “Disrupting class made school more bearable . . .but after school—that longed-for part of the day belongs to the kid alone—waswhat counted for me and the kids of my generation.” He begged his mother to gethim a tape recorder to practice his act, and he would make fun of authorityfigures in the neighborhood. He recounted, “Now we’d be called ‘delinquents,’‘troubled,’ ‘alienated,’ or worse; certainly some of the guys from theneighborhood later did time. But there was something innocent about running wildon the streets back then.”Carlin quit school in the ninth grade, later recounting, “I had great marks. Iwas a smart kid, but I didn’t care. They weren’t teaching what I wanted. Ididn’t give a shit. It’s important in life . . . not to give a shit. It can helpyou a lot.”When he was 17, Carlin joined the U.S. Air Force. He later proudly recounted:“So that’s two court-martials, and four more Article 15s after the first one. .. . A grand total of seven major disciplinary offenses. Pretty fuckingimpressive.” One of his court-martials happened overseas, drunk in his barrackscelebrating his beloved Brooklyn Dodgers beating the Yankees in the WorldSeries. His sergeant yelled at him, “Shut up, Carlin!” to which Carlin tells us,“I replied with my standard ‘Go fuck yourself, cocksucker!’” By luck, heeventually received a 3916 discharge, which Carlin recounted, “was like ano-fault divorce.” Gaining an early exit without dishonorable discharge forCarlin meant, “I absolutely beat the game.”While still in the air force, Carlin began working as a radio disc jockey. In1959 at age 22, Carlin teamed up with Jack Burns, and in February 1960, theyheaded to Hollywood, dreaming of performing on the Tonight Show. With good luckand some connections, they were on that show by the end of the year.“The sixties were my nice years,” Carlin recounted, “my nice suit, my nicecollar, my nice tie, my nice haircut—and my nice material.” Though at that timestill tame himself, Carlin had enormous respect for the edgier Lenny Bruce andMort Sahl, “They were challenging authority. That’s what comedy is supposed todo.” Bruce and Sahl liked Carlin, and they helped him with career connections.By the end of 1960s, Carlin was disgusted with his “mainstream dream” and“people pleaser job.” He began coming to terms with who he really was: “I gotkicked out of three different schools. I got kicked out of the Air Force. I gotkicked out of the choir. I got kicked out of the altar boys. I got kicked out ofsummer camp. I got kicked out of the Boy Scouts. . . . I was a pot smoker when Iwas 13. We broke the law. . . . I swam against the tide of what is expected andwhat the establishment wants from us. But I didn’t know that about myself . . .because this dream blinded me.” He began to recognize that he was a rebel whowanted to artistically project ideas.In the 1970s, a new countercultural Carlin emerged with a beard and long hair.He recorded the album Class Clown with his now famous “Seven Words You Can NeverSay on Television,” and in 1972, he got arrested in Milwaukee for performing it.Luckily for Carlin, it was the 1970s, and so unlike Lenny Bruce, the case wasdismissed with the judge declaring that Carlin’s language was indecent but thathe hadn’t broken the law. However, as the counterculture began to diminish,Carlin lost much of his audience and faced another existential crisis.In the 1980s, Carlin’s life was a mess, “Throughout the eighties I had outburstsof anger. It kept building up and festering. Anger at myself for getting myselfin this tax mess, for being such a cokehead I didn’t have the sense to avoid thetax mess.” Married to Brenda since 1961 and a father since 1963, Carlin also wasangry with himself for his failings in his marriage and his parenting. ButCarlin used his crisis for ideological and artistic transformation.“The [1980] election of Ronald Reagan,” Carlin recounted, “might’ve been thebeginning of my giving up on my species. Because it was absurd.” The absurdityof the Reagan years, Carlin recalled, helped him to find “an authentic positionto speak from.” Carlin started reading Alexander Cockburn, Noam Chomsky, HunterS. Thompson, and Gore Vidal, and acknowledged, “I had a left-wing, humanitarian,secular humanist, liberal inclination,” but added, “Liberal orthodoxy was asrepugnant to me as conservative orthodoxy.”Carlin ultimately came to major realizations such as: “Laughter is not the onlyproof of success. Boy, what a liberating recognition that was! . . . Gettinglaughs all the time wasn’t my only responsibility. My responsibility was toengage the audience’s mind” [Carlin’s emphasis].While Noam Chomsky’s quiet voice and unchanging facial expressions gives hisanti-authoritarian messages a certain power for some audiences, when Carlinbegan delivering Chomsky-like messages, he was able to reach a larger audiencethat needed to be entertained while prodded to think. A few Carlin examples:“America’s manhood problem was typified by the teenage sexual slang we use aboutwar. In Vietnam we didn’t ‘go all the way.’ We ‘pulled out.’ Very unmanly. Whenyou fuck an entire people you have to keep fucking and fucking them—women andchildren too—till they’re all dead.”“I don’t feel about war the way we’re supposed to, the way we’re told to by theUnited States government. A large part of which is the United States military,whose business is war. So the military is telling us how to feel about war—sothey can stay in business. Something is fucked up here.”“Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea thatyou have freedom of choice. You don’t. You have no choice! You have owners! Theyown you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own andcontrol the corporations. They’ve long since bought and paid for the Senate, theCongress, the statehouses, the city halls. They got the judges in their backpockets and they own all the big media companies, so they control just about allof the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls.”As with all the anti-authoritarians in this book, Carlin was far from a perfecthuman being, especially with regard to self-destructive behaviors, most notablywith his severe substance abuse. But with some luck, maturation, humility, andeventually moderation and ultimately abstinence, Carlin’s substance abuse didnot kill him before he became an anti-authoritarian prophet.Given the friends Carlin grew up with, the nature of the entertainment industryespecially during his formative years, the counterculture drug influence, andthe general societal hypocrisy around drugs that made it easy for anyanti-authoritarian to disregard drug admonitions, it’s understandable how Carlinalmost destroyed himself and his family with his substance abuse. Carlin, evenafter he stopped abusing drugs, had positive memories about hallucinogenicdrugs, “Took some acid and mescaline. Didn’t overdo it. I had a couple of tripsthat weren’t the best. But I had a lot of great trips. . . . Fuck the drug war.Dropping acid was a profound turning point for me, a seminal experience. I makeno apologies for it.”For Carlin, it took some time to separate drug realities from authoritarianpropaganda. For example, with respect to the amphetamine-like Ritalin, Carlinrecounted, “I’d always used Ritalin. My Ritalin habit didn’t make me crazy. Iused to take half a Ritalin, or at most one and a half (I had a doctor’sprescription for the stuff). That was my speed during my so-called straightyears: the groundwork was laid early on for my attraction to cocaine.”Carlin’s maturation, humility, moderation, and ultimately complete abstinencewas a gradual process. He recounted that in 1972, “I was already using enoughcocaine that I had to think consciously about not using it to record an album.”Between Carlin’s cocaine abuse and his wife’s alcohol abuse, their marriagebecame chaotic and violent, and on a 1973 family vacation, they brandishedknives at each other, terrifying their ten-year-old daughter Kelly. Carlinstarted to gradually mature, “My own drug use, post-Brenda-sober, fell off. . .. Pot I still saw as benign.”As Carlin began caring about being more than just an entertaining comic, and ashe became increasingly consumed by being an artist, he realized, “During my drugperiod, the only thing that was important was getting high—and fulfilling dateswhen I could. I don’t recall these feelings of pursuing and appreciatingartistry, the increasing ability to create. I’m sure the drugs blocked that sortof thing out.” In 2004, Carlin entered rehab. “For a long time—since giving uppot in the late eighties—I’d been addicted to an opiate called wine-and-Vicodin.. . .I couldn’t control it and I needed help. . . . I developed a newappreciation of the AA techniques . . . whatever skepticism I’d had about them.. . . Although I can do without that Higher Power stuff.”At age 67, Carlin recounted, “I put an end to five decades of substance abuse.”However, after a lengthy history of cardiac problems including three heartattacks in 1978, 1982, and 1991, Carlin died of heart failure at age 71 in 2008.Carlin knew that in order to engage audiences, he needed to connect with them onan emotional level, and he effectively connected with increasingly cynical U.S.audiences. In his 1997 book Brain Droppings, he wrote: “I frankly don’t give afuck how it all turns out in this country—or anywhere else, for that matter . .. . My motto: Fuck Hope! . . . I view my species with a combination of wonderand pity, and I root for its destruction.” Ironically, the arc of Carlin’s lifeprovides hope for anti-authoritarians that their lives need not be tragic ones."},{"pageContent":"11: WE DON’T NEED NO BADGESDepression, Relationships, Mutual Aid, and ParentingThis final chapter offers some general ideas with respect to depression,relationships, mutual aid, and parenting. In all these areas, what I learned inmy schooling and “badges acquisition” has been of little value. However, I havelearned a few things in my direct experiences with anti-authoritarians who arestruggling to survive and thrive.DepressionAnti-authoritarians, by nature, assess the legitimacy of authority before takingthat authority seriously, and they don’t take seriously any authority with aconsistent record of hypocrisies and an absence of basic common sense—thiscovers mainstream mental health authorities as well as the mainstream media.In July 2017, Time magazine ran a lengthy article, “New Hope for Depression”which reported: “The biggest development has been the rediscovery of apromising, yet fraught, drug called ketamine. It’s best known as a psychedelicclub drug that makes people hallucinate, but it may also have the ability toease depression—and fast.”Ketamine or “Special K,” as it’s called on the street, is classified as a“dissociative anesthetic,” routinely used as a veterinary anesthetic drug.Adverse effects include numbness, depression, amnesia, hallucinations, andpotentially fatal respiratory problems. And the Foundation for a Drug Free Worldadds, “Ketamine users can also develop cravings for the drug. At high doses,users experience an effect referred to as ‘K-Hole,’ an ‘out of body’ or‘near-death’ experience. Due to the detached, dreamlike state it creates, wherethe user finds it difficult to move, ketamine has been used as a ‘date-rape’drug.”While psychiatry and the mainstream media are currently excited about thedate-rape drug ketamine, this drug is by no means the first “promising newdepression medication” in the history of psychiatry. Sigmund Freud was depressedas a young man and started using cocaine, cheerfully proclaiming, “I am just nowbusy collecting the literature for a song of praise to this magical substance. .. . You perceive an increase of self-control and possess more vitality andcapacity for work. . . . Absolutely no craving for the further use of cocaineappears after the first, or even after repeated taking of the drug.” The nextmiracle antidepressant drugs were amphetamines, with Benzedrine created in 1936(today, amphetamines such as Adderall and Vyvance are used for ADHD).Beginning in the late 1980s, the “miracle antidepressants” were the SSRIs(selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) such as Prozac, Paxil, and Zoloft;yet, these SSRIs turned out to be far less effective than initially proclaimed.That same 2017 Time article reported the following about the SSRIs and otherantidepressants: “The largest, longest study conducted on depression treatments,called the STAR*D trial, found that after people tried four antidepressants overthe course of five years. . . . 30% of patients don’t experience remission atall.” But the failure rate reality is actually far worse. Taking relapse ratesinto account, according to an American Journal of Psychiatry editorial thataccompanied the STAR*D report, there was actually a 57% long-term failure ratein STAR*D—but even this analysis turned out to be overly optimistic. Lateranalyses of STAR*D data by psychologist Ed Pigott and medical reporter RobertWhitaker revealed that less than 3% of the entire group of depressed patientswho began the STAR*D study were ascertained as having a sustained remission(participated in the final assessment without relapsing and/or dropping out).The United States is home to a drug culture in which both authoritarians andanti-authoritarians participate. Some authoritarians seek drugs that can turnlarge profits and that maintain the status quo by facilitating compliance. Someanti-authoritarians, especially early in life, prize a drug that makes them lesscompliant to authority and that blissfully connects them with the universe. Somepeople swear by Prozac or Zoloft, while others swear by marijuana or LSD.Anti-authoritarians, for the most part, are not opposed to the informed use ofdrugs, but they are opposed to prescription/illegal drug hypocrisies andmisinformation about drug effectiveness and adverse effects.What about talk therapy? Some people swear by it, but for others it’s a waste oftime. Psychologist Bruce Wampold reviewed the psychotherapy outcome literature,examining hundreds of studies for his 2001 book The Great Psychotherapy Debate.Wampold found that no therapy techniques are any better than any other, but whatis highly associated with therapy effectiveness is the nature of the alliancebetween therapist and client, including a client’s confidence in the therapy andin the therapist. “Simply stated,” Wampold concludes, “the client must believein the treatment or be led to believe in it.”Be it antidepressant drugs or talk therapy, the effectiveness of treatmentlargely depends on faith in the treatment, and this can be problematic foranti-authoritarians who don’t easily have faith. What, then, are wise and unwisestrategies and techniques for depressed anti-authoritarians?Depression is fueled by overwhelming pain, and there are many unwise ways todistract ourselves from pain that may work in the short term but are dangerousin the long term. For example, some people cut themselves to distract themselvesfrom emotional pain. I admit to temporarily having latched on to another unwisestrategy that unfortunately worked for a while. When I was depressed in graduateschool, I accidentally walked out of a chain supermarket without paying for asix-pack of beer that was on the bottom rack of the shopping cart. In theparking lot, when I realized what I had done, I discovered the antidepressanteffects of shoplifting. I got a little addicted to the shoplifting buzz and didthis same maneuver a few more times. But one day, I noticed that the supermarkethad installed mirrors so that the cashier could see the bottom rack. That shookme up. I recall thinking that I was already humiliating myself everyday byremaining in graduate school, and that I didn’t need the extra humiliation ofgetting arrested for shoplifting. So I achieved shoplifting sobriety.Lots of other poor choices “work” temporarily but not in the long term. It’slikely that the chronically depressed Alexander Berkman got a euphoric buzz inplanning the assassination of Henry Clay Frick with his cousin and Emma Goldman.But Berkman’s assassination attempt resulted in 14 depressing years of hard timein prison, lifelong physical health problems, bouts of depression, andsuicidality. Similarly, I can see how the idea of assassinating McKinley couldgive an anarchist a buzz; however, while doing that deed didn’t result in a longlife of misery and depression for Leon Czolgosz, that’s only because less thantwo months after shooting McKinley, he was electrocuted by the state with 1800volts, multiple times.When overwhelmed by pain, some people consider and/or attempt suicide. Mentalhealth authorities such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness proclaim,“Research has found that about 90% of individuals who die by suicide experiencemental illness.” However, anti-authoritarian suicidologist David Webb, whoattempted suicide several times and was psychiatrically treated, ultimatelyconcluded that it was unhelpful to view feeling suicidal as a consequence ofmental illness. In his book Thinking About Suicide, Webb criticizes the “mentalillness approach” as medicalizing what he views as a “sacred crisis of theself.”For Webb, if being suicidal is viewed as a symptom of mental illness then“talking about your suicidal feelings runs the very real risk of findingyourself being judged, locked up and drugged.” So many critically-thinkingsuicidal anti-­authoritarians don’t reach out. Society stigmatizes mentalillness, so how can one expect a person overwhelmed by emotional pain not toself-stigmatize once they’ve been labeled as mentally ill? And this stigmacreates more pain and hopelessness. In contrast, what was helpful for Webb andhelpful for many other anti-authoritarians is validation that their pain isevidence of their soul and their humanity.Overwhelming pain—be it financial, physical, relationship, school, otherincarcerations, or from other sources—is the fuel of depression. So thecommonsense question is: How do you reduce pain and increase joy in a way thatdoesn’t make matters worse in the long run?Mainstream mental health professionals, especially those involved in chemicaldependency treatment, may deride the “geographical cure” of simply exiting amiserable situation. But Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman certainly did notderide the geographical cure, and Edward Snowden seems a lot better off with hisgeographical cure than having his health destroyed in federal prison as was thecase with Eugene Debs.In our moneyed society, financial pains can be lethal, and were especially sofor Lenny Bruce, Alexander Berkman, and also many non-famous anti-authoritarianswho I’ve known. In our economic system, it is difficult to make a living doingwhat one believes in, and young anti-authoritarians are often tough onthemselves in this regard, adding more pain to their lives. Manyanti-authoritarians today often have little choice but low-wage slavery. One cantry to escape, but sometimes that’s difficult. If life circumstances such as anailing parent or child-­custody requirements keep one stuck in a small townwhere the only employer is a prison, self-flagellation does no one any good;being the kindest prison guard possible does do some good. And if one is miredin student-loan debt and the only survival option is being a teacher in anauthoritarian school, one can try to get some satisfaction by perhaps notforcing students to raise their hands to take a dump.In our economic system, few of us are not prostituting ourselves to some extent,and so, for those unskilled at denial of this reality, the only real antidote tothis pain is a sense of humor. One of my favorite Emma Goldman stories is abouther attempt to sexually prostitute herself to raise money for Berkman’sassassination expedition. She initially scolds herself, “Sasha is giving hislife, and you shrink from giving your body, miserable coward.” The 23-year-oldGoldman then composed herself, convinced herself that she could attractcustomers (“my curly blond hair showed off well with my blue eyes”), and sheproceeded on a Saturday evening in 1892 to walk up and down Fourteenth Street inManhattan. Finally, she got what she thought was a customer, but instead ofbuying sex, he told her that she didn’t have the knack for it, gave her $10, andtold her to go home. This provided a revelation for Goldman, who recounted thatpreviously, “I had met two categories of men: vulgarians and idealists . . . .This man . . . seemed an entirely new type.” Sometimes, as Goldman discovered,we learn something new by our prostitution efforts, especially if we haveretained our sense of humor.Relationships are critical to depression. Before pharmaceutical companiesannexed psychiatry, the obvious importance of relationships to depression wascommon sense even among mental health professionals. The Interactional Nature ofDepression, edited by psychologists Thomas Joiner and James Coyne, documentshundreds of studies on the interpersonal nature of depression. In one study ofunhappily married women who were diagnosed with depression, 60% of them believedtheir unhappy marriage was the primary cause of their depression. In anotherstudy, the best single predictor of depression relapse was found to be theresponse to a single item: “How critical is your spouse of you?” Criticism fromone’s spouse is painful and potentially depressing unless one doesn’t care aboutone’s spouse, and if that is the case, that can be even more depressing.A key to overcoming immobilizing depression is to take seriously somethingbesides one’s depression, one’s mood, and oneself. This is the message of theBuddha, Spinoza, and many other wise thinkers. If, unlike Thomas Paine, onelacks the energy to start a couple of revolutions but is passionate aboutpolitics, it is still possible to hang out with like-minded people—an instantantidepressant for Emma Goldman. Or if one has given up on changing the world,then one can also hang out with like-minded people—or, like George Carlin, makea buck entertaining them.RelationshipsThere is no more important variable in determining tragedy or triumph foranti-authoritarians than their relationships.All the anti-authoritarians profiled in this book who hurt themselves, others,or the cause of anti-authoritarianism were pained by their relationships or bytheir isolation. Phil Ochs, Lenny Bruce, and Ida Lupino had troubled marriages.Leon Czolgosz and Ted Kaczynski lacked any intimates. And Alexander Berkman,from his early family life to lengthy prison time, had great pain in this areaas well.In contrast, the profiled anti-authoritarians who helped themselves and theanti-authoritarian cause had satisfying relationships. Jane and Robert Jacobs aswell as Scott and Helen Nearing had long-term mutually affectionate marriages,in which they complemented one another in terms of personality traits andfinances and teamed together politically. Carol Chomsky, married to Noam Chomskyfor 59 years until her death, was a fellow linguist, had similar politicalviews, and volunteered to go back to school to become the family breadwinner inthe event that Noam became incarcerated for his activism.Anna Murray Douglass, married to Frederick Douglass for 44 years until herdeath, financed his escape, helped support their family in the early going, wasinvolved in the abolitionist movement, and remained a loyal supporter eventhough their closeness diminished. The 36-year marriage of Brenda and GeorgeCarlin had periods of chaos due to mutual substance abuse, but George generallyviewed them as a “good team,” especially in support of his career which providedtheir income.When Harriet Tubman’s attempt to rescue her first husband failed because of hisdisloyalty to her, she didn’t try again; and she would later remarry a moreloyal man. In contrast, Ida Lupino repeatedly attempted to rescue her disloyalhusband, and the relationship pain of this marriage contributed to her alcoholabuse.Helen Keller never married but had hugely supportive people in her life,including her 49-year relationship with Anne Sullivan, another lengthyfriendship with Polly Thomson, as well as other friends and family. Likewise,Henry David Thoreau had no spouse, but he had a supportive community of loyalfriends and family.In the United States, we are socialized to fail at relationships. Consumerculture and advertising propagandizes us to obsess over our needs, and itmanipulates the invention of needs. Consumer culture sells the belief that lifeis all about a selfish pursuit of needs, and Americans have many self-absorbed“success models” in business and politics. A self-absorbed obsession over one’sneeds makes satisfying relationships impossible. School teaches us toaggressively compete with the kid sitting next to us rather than cooperatingtogether to solve problems. And it is the highly unusual child who has beentaught that even the best of relationships create tensions, and who learns howto nonviolently resolve those tensions.There are anti-authoritarians who have rejected the authority of consumerculture and who have ideals that could make satisfying relationships morelikely, but many of these anti-­authoritarians have their own set ofrelationship problems.Anti-authoritarians often have conflicts with one another. Alexander Berkmancreated tension with his fellow anarchists by criticizing them for not being asmaterially self-denying as he was. Even though anti-authoritarians might havesimilar ideologies, they can often focus on their differences, resulting intension, hostility, and estrangement. A famous falling out occurred betweenabolitionists Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison over several issues(including Garrison’s contention that the U.S. Constitution was a pro-slavedocument that needed to be abolished, a view that Douglass came to oppose; aswell as the Douglass creation of an alternative abolitionist newspaper thatcompeted with Garrison’s). After being invaluable to one another and a greatteam, Garrison and Douglass never healed their relationship fracture.Anti-authoritarian activists can have so much rage over injustice and feel sopowerless that their passions can get in the way of wisdom. As noted, EmmaGoldman, Alexander Berkman, and his cousin Modska fed off each other’s rage intheir ill-advised assassination conspiracy that put Berkman in prison, whichcreated lifelong guilt for the other two, hurt the labor union strike and thecause of anarchism, and created public sympathy for the authoritarian Henry ClayFrick.Activism can be a source of tension for romantic partners who may not share thesame degree of ideological passion or commitment. While Betty Shabazz, afterMalcolm X’s death, would describe her marriage to him as “the greatest thing inmy life,” the reality, according to Malcolm X’s biographer Manning Marable, wasthat their marriage was a troubled one. Marable notes, “She had come to resentthe fact that for Malcolm, the work of the Nation always came first.”The conflict between Eugene Debs and his wife Kate Debs was made famous byIrving Stone’s biographical novel Adversary in the House. While Kate may nothave been quite as ideologically adversarial as Stone suggests (Kate onceloyally told a reporter doing a story on her husband, “Indeed I am aSocialist”), Debs biographer Ray Ginger does report tension caused by Debs’spolitical activism: “She sometimes remarked to small groups of Socialists thather husband was killing himself for people who did not appreciate it. She beganto be cold and formal to Socialists who called at her home. She wanted Eugene tobe more a husband and less a Socialist, to pay some attention to his health andthe family income.” Ginger tell us that “Kate would never have cared about thelabor movement” had it not been for her husband’s personality, as she was “drawnby his candor and persuasiveness.” However, because she was not a politicalactivist, Kate was often lonely, resulting in sadness for her and tension in themarriage.While Ralph Nader maintains close relationships with his siblings and theirfamilies, he does not see it possible for a dedicated activist to have a spouse.His sister Laura Nader recounted, “People always used to say, ‘Why didn’t youget married?’ And he would always say, ‘What wife would want to tolerate this,my working 18 hours a day?’” And friend and fellow activist Gene Karpinskirecounted, “He gave me a line I’ll never forget: ‘Gene, there are two kinds ofpeople in this world, the hard-core and the spouse-core. You gotta decide whichside are you on.’”Minimizing resentments and resolving them before they become lethal are criticalto relationships. Resentments occur when people feel discounted, disrespected,used, abused, or coerced. Coercion is intrinsic to Western culture’s employment,schooling, and parenting. In Western culture, compared to many indigenouscultures, there is little effort at minimizing resentment, and people areroutinely unskilled at resolving small resentments before they turn intounresolvable poisons. In Western culture, the decision-making continuum rangesfrom complete authoritarian control (as in the military) to majority rule (inelections), resulting in many people being discounted and resentful.In many indigenous cultures, great time and energy is spent in achievingconsensus in which nobody feels discounted and resentful. And if resentments dooccur, there is great time and energy given to resolving them. Moreover, thereis an understanding that if resentments cannot be avoided or resolved, it isbetter for all involved to separate rather than utilizing coercions to forcecompliance.Many anti-authoritarians are well aware that coercion results in resentmentsthat destroy relationships. However, even with this awareness,anti-authoritarians often still fail to effectively minimize and resolveresentments. Anti-authoritarians often have a great deal of pain, which fuelsanger and depression, making it difficult to have the time, patience, and energyto prevent or resolve resentments.Thus, to reduce the fuel for unwise compulsive reactions, anti-authoritariansneed to make all efforts to reduce unnecessary pain and increase joy.Anti-authoritarians need to pay attention to their “pain fuel level,”recognizing that when it gets too high, they are vulnerable to unwise compulsivereactions.A key to satisfying relationships is how dissent—and the tension it creates—isdealt with. If one ignores or pathologizes dissent, then one is behaving as anauthoritarian, even if one considers oneself otherwise. Non-hypocriticalanti-authoritarians take seriously dissent in their personal relationships, andthey engage in dialogue to resolve it.Mutual AidSome anti-authoritarians attempt to attain complete self-­sufficiency as a wayof exiting coercive hierarchies. Other anti-­authoritarians attempt as muchself-sufficiency as possible but also embrace mutual aid—cooperation withoutcoercion.In mutual-aid groups, joining and participation is voluntary and an absence ofcoercion is the goal of organization. In practice, mutual-aid groups arenonhierarchical and egalitarian, distinguished by consensus decision making andparticipatory democracy.While a great number of people see value in the mutual aid of AlcoholicsAnonymous, many of them would be surprised to discover that the concept ofmutual aid was popularized in the early twentieth century by the Russiananarchist Prince Peter Kropotkin (1842–1921) with his 1902 book Mutual Aid. Andmany AA participants might be shocked to discover that AA co-founder Bill W.esteemed the “gentle Russian prince” Kropotkin and saw value in nonviolentanarchism.In Alcoholics Anonymous Comes of Age, Bill W. pointed out how attractive thenoncoercive nature and freedom of AA is for newcomers, “We cannot be compelledto do anything. In that sense this society is a benign anarchy. The word‘anarchy’ has a bad meaning to most of us. . . . . But I think that the gentleRussian prince who so strongly advocated the idea felt that if men were grantedabsolute liberty and were compelled to obey no one in person, they would thenvoluntarily associate themselves in a common interest. Alcoholics Anonymous isan association of the benign sort the prince envisioned.” Anarchist writer LoganMarie Glitterbomb points out that AA’s Twelve Traditions are replete withanarchist mutual-aid principles: stressing unity and solidarity; no governingleaders; and self-supporting and autonomous groups. Anti-authoritarian GeorgeCarlin embraced AA but added, “I can do without that Higher Power stuff.” Manyanti-authoritarians agree, and Alcoholics Anonymous Comes of Age recounts AAfounders’ consideration of not using the word God in AA’s “Twelve Traditions”and their “Twelve Steps.” They ultimately chose to use God but to make clearthat the term was open to individual interpretation.The beauty of a mutual-aid group is that while individuals may join for aspecific goal—in AA, to stop drinking—the non-coercive nature of a mutual-aidgroup can be so satisfying that it becomes a vehicle to build community,including career contacts, friends, and lovers.Mutual aid occurred in the slave abolitionist groups and among those involvedwith the Underground Railroad. Historian Henry Louis Gates reports that whilethe vast majority of runaway slaves were young males who absconded alone andthen later received help, “The Underground Railroad and the abolition movementitself were perhaps the first instances in American history of a genuinelyinterracial coalition . . . predominantly run by free Northern African Americans. . . with the assistance of white abolitionists, many of whom were Quakers.”Scholars estimate the number of slaves who escaped range from 25,000 to 100,000.Beyond helping facilitate escape, the mutual aid of the Underground Railroad andthe abolitionist movement also created fertile grounds for community.Vital communities have also been created in mutual-aid workplaces, labor unions,and political activist groups. For U.S. anarchists in the late nineteenth andearly twentieth century, there was certainly individual tragedy and politicalfailure, however, historians Paul Avrich and Karen Avrich capture in Sasha andEmma these anarchists’ rich community. In major U.S. cities, there existed anetwork of informal mutual assistance among anarchists to provide housing andother necessities. Immediately prior to Berkman’s assassination attempt onFrick, the Emma-Sasha-Modska trio partnered in a successful worker-­collectivelunchroom-ice cream parlor in Worcester, Massachusetts, in order to financiallysupport themselves.The mutual-aid groups with which I am most personally familiar with are thosecreated by ex-psychiatric patients, for example, MindFreedom and the WesternMass Recovery Learning Community. These mutual-aid groups vary in funding,autonomy, decision making, and the variety of mutual assistance offered. Membersof these groups are routinely anti-authoritarians who have questioned andchallenged the legitimacy of mainstream professional authorities and haveresisted them, creating their own alternatives. Through these and othermutual-aid groups, former psychiatric patients—though often previously labeledby mental health professionals as socially unskilled—find friends and aclose-knit community.Mutual-aid groups are a threat to authoritarians, and so authoritarians willattempt to co-opt them, diverting them from their original role and adoptingthem for their own purposes. What makes AA attractive as a mutual-aid group isvoluntary participation, but when court systems coerce people to attendmeetings, the non-coercive culture is destroyed; and when hospitals use AAgroups as part of a profit-making enterprise, this also subverts the essence ofAA. Similarly, the value of mutual aid among former psychiatric patients hasbeen subverted by the co-opting of peer support. Such co-opting occurs whenso-called “peer specialists”—ex-psychiatric patients hired in psychiatrichospitals or other institutions—are positioned at the bottom of the workplacehierarchy and used to persuade current patients to accept their treatments.Authoritarians in power and their like-minded subordinates believe thathierarchy is the only way that human beings can be organized, and that withoutsuch hierarchy there is only chaos. And so, if authoritarians cannot eliminatemutual aid, they will attempt to co-opt it to maintain their own control. Forthis reason, anti-authoritarians should always be prepared for rejection byauthoritarians of any true mutual aid. And if mutual-aid efforts provesuccessful, anti-authoritarians should always be watchful against authoritariansubversion or co-optation.ParentingIn psychology classes, I was taught that taking away enjoyable stuff from miceor kids in order to get them to learn is called “negative reinforcement,” whichalong with “positive reinforcement” and “punishment” are elements of “behaviormodification.” This certainly works to control most mice and even some kids—butnot anti-authoritarian kids.Nowadays, these negative behavioral-modifications are routinely called“consequences” but in my day, parents called them punishments. I didn’t getpunished much since I did well in school, but when I did, the punishment wasusually “no television,” and I remember my immediate response to it. When mymother said, “No television for a week,” I said, “Make it two weeks, I don’tcare.” When she responded, “Then two weeks it is,” I said, “I don’t care, makeit a month.” It progressed to years, decades, and centuries. I think by 2567, Iwill have served my time. So I have some empathy for how a young AlexanderBerkman’s bravado bought himself a lengthier prison sentence than if he hademployed a competent lawyer.Professionally, I have worked with kids for whom the coercions of parents,teachers, and other adults failed to control behaviors but succeeded in creatingresentments. These kids, like me, were not going to allow adults to useknowledge of their joys and pains for purposes of control, so they learned tohide their true joys and pains. They learned to be guarded about their true selfso as it would not be used against them. Some kids learn that it’s easier tohide themselves from the adult world if they hide from themselves, and so thesekids lose awareness of who they are—and some of them need to, later in life,“crack up” for rediscovery.Life is filled with ironies and occasional pleasant surprises. Ironically, my“stinkin’ badges” have given me access to parents of anti-authoritarian kids.And a pleasant surprise for me has been how infrequently I’ve been fired bythese parents. Only rarely has an authoritarian parent dragged theiranti-authoritarian kid into my office with expectations that I would provide“treatment” to make their child unquestioningly obedient. The vast majority ofparents I have worked with are more of what I would call normies than Nazis.Normies buy into societal norms. They take seriously PhDs and licensing badgesof authority. Normie parents may intellectually understand that people can be sooverwhelmed by pain that they become self-destructive or violent, but it iseasier for normies to compartmentalize such people as mentally ill. Normieparents want to do the “right thing” with their kids; but unfortunately, takingseriously professional badges often turns out to be the wrong thing. The vastmajority of mental health professionals are not anti-authoritarians, so theyoften give advice that can turn a resolvable problem into a tragedy.While coercions work to control the behavior of many mental health professionalsthemselves, coercions don’t work on anti-authoritarians. While normies get apositive buzz by pleasing authorities and receiving good grades,anti-­authoritarian kids get no such buzz for compliance. For anti-authoritariankids, coercions only create resentments. Resentment destroys relationships andeliminates the possibility for dialogue that can solve problems.Anti-authoritarian children and teenagers are often taken by parents to a mentalhealth professional because they are underachieving in standard schools. Theseyoung people resist all coercions that demand giving attention to subjects thatbore them, doing homework for which they see no value, or staying inside abuilding that feels sterile and suffocating. All anti-authoritarian kids do nothave the same temperaments, so such coercions result in some differentoutcomes—all unpleasant ones.Some gentler anti-authoritarian kids resist coercions but worry that theirresistance will result in dire life consequences. They worry that performingpoorly in school will mean “flipping burgers” for the rest of their lives. Theiranxiety and pain of failure is exacerbated by their parents’ anxiety overfailure, and these kids become hopeless, believing that all of life will be asmiserable as school. This can result in debilitating anxiety and immobilizingdepression. On many occasions I’ve seen school failure and the threat of notgraduating high school make a teenager suicidal. It is routine for doctors tomedicate these kids with an array of psychiatric drugs, and if parents andprofessionals become anxious about suicide, these kids are often psychiatricallyhospitalized, though hospitalization is no guarantee of safety (as 6% of allAmerican suicides occur in hospitals).In psychiatric hospitalizations, suicidal young people are routinely told thatthey are mentally ill. This makes many anti-­authoritarian kids even morehopeless. Anti-authoritarians are rarely employed in these institutions—wherethey could offer young people validation for their common experience, forexample, of pain over authoritarian schooling. That validation can both reducepain and increase hope—and open them up for dialogue, which can help youngpeople gain perspective, reduce pain, and act with greater wisdom.Anti-authoritarian kids will often question the legitimacy of mental healthauthorities whose interventions appear ludicrous to them. One such interventionis the “no-suicide contract” in which the patient agrees not to attempt suicideand to seek help if unable to honor the commitment. Signing such a contract isoften a requirement for release from a psychiatric hospital. For many patients,it is obvious that these contracts don’t prevent suicide (confirmed by research)and serve only to reduce the anxiety of the hospital staff.Other anti-authoritarian kids with less gentle temperaments don’t take seriouslytheir schooling or admonitions from authorities that their rebellious behaviorwill doom them. They feel justified in resisting coercion. Their resistance isroutinely labeled by mental health professionals as “acting out,” and they arediagnosed with various disruptive disorders. Their parents often attemptpunishments, which don’t work to break these kids’ resistance. Parents becomefrustrated and resentful that their child is causing them stress. Children feelparental frustration and resentment and may come to believe their parents do notlike them. So these kids stop liking their parents, stop caring about theirparents’ feelings, and seek out peers who they believe do like them, even ifthese peers are engaged in criminal behaviors. If parents have financialresources, these kids are often sent to “therapeutic boarding schools” wherethey associate with kids who may be even angrier than they are, and from whomthey learn even more harmful criminal behaviors.Although these kids are often accused of having “authority issues,” it has beenmy experience that many anti-authoritarian young people labeled with psychiatricdisorders don’t reject all authorities, only those whom they’ve assessed to beillegitimate. Often these young people are craving a mutually respectfulrelationship with an adult who can help them navigate the authoritarian societyaround them. Anti-authoritarian young people assess adults before taking themseriously, and while they will challenge and resist adult authorities who theydeem to be illegitimate, they are receptive toward authorities who provelegitimate. Honesty and sincerity are necessary for an authority to beconsidered legitimate. Young anti-authoritarians must also sense that an adulthas both affection and respect for their anti-authoritarian nature.People engage with those who make them feel good. Normie professionals andparents routinely fail to engage young anti-­authoritarians because theirfrustration, anger, punishments, incongruence, and pathologizing are unpleasantfor these kids. What feels good is affection, respect, empathy, nurturance,humor, and mutual fun. When young anti-authoritarians feel that they are liked,understood, and are not being manipulated, most are open to a dialogue about howbest to navigate the world without self-destructive or destructive behaviors.Normie mental health professionals and normie parents routinely fail to helpdestructive and self-destructive young anti-authoritarians because they areincapable of seeing anti-­authoritarians’ anger as legitimate and valid. Normiescannot adequately empathize with the painfulness of coercion and how such painfuels destructive behavior. Invalidated pain can cause some younganti-authoritarians to become completely hopeless and others to becomecompletely enraged.With young anti-authoritarians’ overwhelming pain, hopelessness, and rage, thereis no dialogue—no space to think or reflect. With genuine validation of theirpain, empathy for hopelessness and rage, and affection and respect for theiranti-­authoritarian nature, dialogue becomes possible—and wisdom can replacecompulsive destructiveness.Finally, some parenting advice from George Carlin on the blindness of someanti-authoritarian parents. He was so annoyed by his own controlling motherthat, like many anti-­authoritarians, he took a laissez-faire approach toparenting his own daughter, Kelly, who began smoking marijuana in her earlyteens and went to school stoned, though at first continuing to receive excellentgrades. Kelly eventually hung out with kids who occasionally stole things fromher father, and George recalled thinking, “But what could I do? Like the drugsituation, I could hardly bitch about it, having been a dedicated felon myselfat their age.” But then Kelly got involved in a relationship with one of thesekids, a boyfriend who emotionally and physically abused her. This resulted inKelly cutting school, adding cocaine and Quaaludes to her drug use, and becomingdepressed, unbeknown to George, who had mistakenly assumed that constantlychecking in or asking children how they were doing would lead to resentment. “Myown parent’s fearsome need to control me scared me off any behavior like that,”he said.Ultimately, George Carlin recognized that what he had needed in his own youthwas not what his daughter needed in hers. At that point, he first went to herboyfriend’s father and told him to make sure the boy did not come aroundanymore. The boy defied this, and George recounted what happened next: “I got mybaseball bat. I showed him the bat and said: ‘I don’t play baseball.Neighborhood I come from, we use bats a different way. To change a person’sbehavior. . . . He got the point. Never came near Kelly again. Later she told meit was the first time in her life she felt I’d done a real traditional fatherlything. She was shocked, she said. And very proud.”It is common for many parents to give their children what they believe that theyneeded from their own parents. However, to love children means recognizing eachchild’s unique personality and individual needs."},{"pageContent":"CONCLUSIONWhile there are certainly societies less free than the United States, what makeslife difficult for U.S. anti-authoritarians are the mixed messages that theyreceive. From the Declaration of Independence, to the Bill of Rights, to theStatue of Liberty, the United States gives the appearance of welcoming those whoresist illegitimate authority. Moreover, the United States is a place whereimmigrant anti-authoritarians such as Thomas Paine and Emma Goldman becamecelebrities. However, when anti-authoritarian resistance truly threatenspowerful U.S. authoritarians, the rug is pulled out—often violently so.Some U.S. anti-authoritarians have been punished with prison and deportation formerely exercising their First Amendment right of “free speech.” However, U.S.anti-authoritarians are not routinely marginalized in these ways. Authoritariansneed only ensure that anti-authoritarians not be heard in order to marginalizethem.Scott Nearing, indicted by the U.S. government for stating his beliefs, wasluckily not convicted in his 1919 trial but was by other means effectivelymarginalized. He wrote in 1972 that for the past half-century, “I have had the‘right’ to speak, write, print, publish, but my words dropped into a deep wellof oblivion. I have the ‘right’ to teach, but no university or school in thecountry would accept me. I could speak, but few public forums would allow me ontheir platforms. I could write, but my books were not published by recognizedfirms, nor were they reviewed in magazines or papers or stocked in book stores.”Many anti-­authoritarians resonate with Nearing’s anger over being disregardedand discarded.Authoritarians realize that simply ignoring opposition is often an effective wayto marginalize it, whether that opposition comes from the voice of a singleanti-authoritarian or the majority of the people. In 2014, political scientistsMartin Gilens and Benjamin Page, in a study published in Perspectives onPolitics, empirically established how average U.S. citizens are almostcompletely ignored by U.S. governmental authorities in terms of public policies.Reviewing U.S. public opinions of policy issues, along with examining 1,779different enacted public policies between 1981 and 2002, they determined that“even when fairly large majorities of Americans favor policy change, theygenerally do not get it.” They conclude, “The central point that emerges fromour research is that economic elites and organized groups representing businessinterests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, whilemass-based interest groups and average citizens have little or no independentinfluence.”When dissent—be it through public opinion polls, protest demonstrations, orotherwise—becomes impotent in changing policy, this is an indicator of livingunder authoritarian rule. If a society is not authoritarian, then the tensionthat dissent creates is resolved so that dissenters experience their grievancesbeing taken seriously, as evidenced by policy changes. In an authoritariansociety, dissenters—even when in the majority—routinely feel impotent andhelpless.Dissent without disobedience is essentially no threat to authoritarians inpower. Clever authoritarians welcome dissent without disobedience, since it canbe easily ignored and provides the illusion of a free and democratic society.Only disobedience can threaten authoritarians.If anti-authoritarian voices prove difficult to ignore, authoritarians willresort to overt assaults. For such assaults, authoritarians will often rely onthe work of “professional authorities,” including the legal system tocriminalize disobedience; mental health professionals to pathologizeanti-authoritarian behavior; and teachers and the media, who label disobedienceas immature.It is no wonder that people who disobey illegitimate authority often feel suchintense anger. Anti-authoritarians cannot be understood if we deny, water down,or pathologize their anger. This anger may be a result of their dissent beingignored. Or it may be a result of overt assaults on them for challenging andresisting illegitimate authority. Or it may be caused by witnessing suchassaults on their anti-authoritarian friends. Or their anger may come fromresentment over being forced into constant vigilance against authoritarianassault. The manner in which anti-authoritarians deal with their anger—and howothers who care about them deal with it—is critical to tragedy or triumph.Contempt for coercion and tolerance for eccentricity are the norms in theanti-authoritarian groups that I have studied and among those with which I havepersonally been involved. I have found striking similarities between theindividual personalities within these groups: Thoreau and his Concord buddies inthe 1840s and 1850s; New York City anarchists living between 1880 and 1918; andmodern so-called “psychiatric survivors.” Today, anti-authoritarians withunconventional behaviors who create tension are often marginalized as mentallyill. That makes these modern anti-authoritarians especially angry, so angry thatthey are likely to create even more tension for others.In my work as a psychologist, I have been lucky to hang out with teenageanti-authoritarians with the intelligence and spirit of a young Phil Ochs, JaneJacobs, Noam Chomsky, Malcolm X, Alexander Berkman, George Carlin, and EdwardSnowden. I have also been involved in the mental health reform movementcomprising former psychiatric patients and dissident mental healthprofessionals. In this movement, I have gotten to know people with personalitiesthat resemble those of Thomas Paine, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, HenryDavid Thoreau, Emma Goldman, Helen Keller, Ida Lupino, and Ralph Nader. Inmovement gatherings and conferences, there are routinely some people who are askind as Eugene Debs or as playful as Lenny Bruce, and who treat fellowanti-authoritarians resembling the socially awkward Leon Czolgosz as if they aresocially adept—and sometimes they become so.Recall that Stanley Milgram, reporting on his research about obedience toauthority, concluded that humanity’s “fatal flaw” is our capacity to abandon ourhumanity so as to comply with abusive authority. Those human beings leastafflicted with that flaw have, sadly, been marginalized in U.S.society—including psychiatrically marginalized.Among the most honored members of modern U.S. society are “first responders” todisasters, including natural disasters such as hurricanes and humanmade onessuch as mass shootings. Anti-authoritarians are also first responders todisasters. They are the first to question, challenge, and resist illegitimateauthority.While U.S. society has honored some famous anti-­authoritarians long after theyare dead, these figures have often been marginalized in their own lifetimes.Throughout U.S. history, anti-authoritarians have usually been able to rely onlyon each other for mutual aid. If this mutual caring diminishes, their triumphswill also diminish. So, while anti-authoritarians need no badges, they do needone another."},{"pageContent":"REFERENCESIntroduction“Amazon Exclusive: Q & A with Author Susan Cain.” 2012.https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking-ebook/dp/B0074YVW1G.American Psychiatric Association.
