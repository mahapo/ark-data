Barack Obama’s speeches contain the hypnosis techni ques of Dr. Milton Erickson, M.D. who developed a form of “conversational” hypnosis that could be hid den in seemingly normal speech and used on patients without their knowledge for therapy purposes. Obam a’s speeches intentionally contain: Obama’s techniques are the height of deception and psychological manipulation, remaining hidden becaus e one must understand the science behind the language patterns in order to spot them. This document examines Obama’s speeches word by word, hand gestur e by hand gesture, tone, pauses, body language, and proves his use of covert hypnosis intended only for licensed therapists on consenting patients. Obama ’s mesmerized, cult-like, grade-school-crush-like wors hip by millions is not because “Obama is the greate st leader of a generation” who simply hasn’t accomplis hed anything, who magically “inspires” by giving speeches. Obama is committing perhaps the biggest fraud and deception in American history. Obama is not just using subliminal messages, but te xtbook covert hypnosis and neuro-linguistic programming techniques on audiences that are intent ionally designed to sideline rational judgment and implant subconscious commands to think he is wonder ful and elect him President. Obama is eloquent. However, Obama’s subconscious techniques are shown to elicit powerful emotion from his audience and then transfer those emotions onto him , to sideline rational judgment, and implant hypnot ic commands that we are unaware of and can’t even consciously questi on. The polls are misleading because some of Obama ’s commands are designed to be triggered only in the v oting booth on November 4th. Obama is immune to logical arguments like Wright, Ayers, shifting ever y position, character, and inexperience, because hy pnosis affects us on an unconscious and emotional level. To many people who see this unaccomplished man’s unnatural and irrational rise to the highest office in the world as suspicious and frightening and to those who welcome it, this document uncovers, explains, and p roves the deceptive tactics behind true “Obama Phenomenon” including why younger people are more e asily affected. -

These certain oppositions answered in this document are: 1. Hypnosis isn’t real - hypnosis wouldn’t / doesn’ t work on me Trance states of mind and enhanced suggestibility h appen to everyone every day; driving in your car, i n the elevator, watching T.V., or listening to music. Th is mild hypnotic state is all that is needed for Er icksonian techniques to implant hypnotic commands you are una ware of. 2. Obama isn’t intentionally using mass hypnosis This document contains over a hundred examples of O bama’s specific language patterns and hypnosis techniques that follow textbook Ericksonian princip les and characteristics too much to be coincidence. 3. Obama’s popularity is not attributable to his us e of hypnosis Young people and more educated people actually have lower hypnotic subconscious suggestibility thresholds for scientific reasons explained. Popul ar perceptions of Obama are provable as inconsisten t with his accomplishments, history, background, and even what is heard from him consciously – however, they match perfectly with the messages he is caught send ing intending to be received only subconsciously. People are admittedly mesmerized by him. The irrat ional rise to power of and uncanny passionate suppo rt for a logically unaccomplished and questionable man based on his speaking alone like the “Obama phenomenon” is widely accepted – only the rational explanation for it is missing. Finally, he would n ot continue to use these deceptive techniques if he di d not believe they work. 4. There is nothing unethical about Obama’s use of hypnosis The techniques used by Obama are the most deceptive forms of communication known to man. They sideline rational judgment and implant subconscious commands that change how people feel and behave without any awareness of the manipulation. Obama’s techniques overcome the will without convincing th e judgment through trickery. Obama often says one me ssage that you are aware of, meanwhile implants a different message hypnotically with double or hidde n meanings. He conjures up emotions by talking abo ut your children, and JFK, and then is caught transfer ring those feelings onto him with hidden hand gestu res. He hides what he is doing and brazenly uses these t echniques in front of millions of people over and o ver. Once explained, Obama’s actions can be shown to be the height of manipulation and deception.

It is not a connection to another p erson that he can deny. It is Obama’s own highly deceptive ac tions, provable once explained, on video, playable over and over. Obama is sidelining rational judgment and using undue influence to win over voters applying psychological subconscious manipulation like never before in American history. No other argument against Obama can fundamentally c hange the way people feel about him deep down inside, EXCEPT, proof that precisely the way they f eel about him deep down inside is because of Obama' s own deception and use of hidden hypnosis. This is because exposing Obama’s use of hypnosis takes the people who are entranced by him subconsciously and emotionally, and puts the issue of why they feel th at way on a conscious rational level where they can an alyze it. It is the one thing that can fundamental ly change the game, and shatter Obama’s magical immuni ty to all of his other faults, logical disqualifica tions, and deceptions. This can include the media changin g their mind about Obama once they see who he reall y is and also helping to expose what Obama is doing i n the interests of democracy. Many people do wake up from the effects of hypnosis once you tell them the y have been hypnotized and explain what has happene d to them. To a lot of people, it is just a missing piece of the puzzle that makes everything else make sense - almost as if it were the missing piece they were so mehow even looking for on some level. 1 PART 1 – HYPNOSIS BASICS You must understand the basics of Ericksonian hypno sis to see what Obama is doing Almost nobody realizes what Obama is doing. These techniques are nearly impossible for an untrained person to detect. With the exception of a few trai ned experts in hypnosis, nobody understands even wh at to look for. It sounds in every way like ordinary pow erful speech. Hypnosis is not sleep, nor what is portrayed in mov ies. In order to spot what Obama is doing, one mus t first understand covert hypnosis and conversational hypno sis, and know how the science works. Only by knowing how hypnosis works will you see that Obama’ s speech often diverges from normal and logical speech patterns, and clearly uses the non-logical, clearly artificial and intentional patterns of hypn otic trance induction, and hypnotic critical factor bypass as t aught in the field of covert and conversational hyp nosis. This document will explain what Obama is precisely doing and how it works by explaining hidden hypnoti c language patterns and other hypnosis techniques, an d pointing out these patterns and techniques in Oba ma’s speeches. Obama is using textbook, clinical trance inductions in his speeches. Obama’s hypnotic techniques work on a subconscious level, and are designed so that peop le watching him in an audience or on TV are complet ely unaware of his techniques and their effects. Obama is using clear hypnotic anchoring, pacing and lead ing, and numerous other hypnosis techniques designed to take away our rational judgment in deciding for who m   1 “The only thing you need to do to break a negative hypnotic spell that has been cast on you is begin to think rationally, to begin to think critically. And if you decide that you ch oose this message as one that’s good for you, by al l means sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride. But, if you decide that this is no t something you want to have in your life, just sim ply analyze it, criticise it, ridicule it, and say “Hey, that’s not how the world works.” And you’ll have protected your mind from taking on board something which you really dont need.” The Power of Conversa tional Hypnosis, Clifford Mee and Igor Ledochowski, re the section entitled “The Dark Side of Hypnosis.”"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 6 to vote in November. Not only is this the only exp lanation that makes sense for the amazing rise and “Obama phenomenon” sweeping our nation, but the evi dence is undeniable. To say Obama’s amazing following and rise to power is simply because he is a great speaker is not logi cally sufficient. Even if Obama were the greatest speake r to come along in 30 years, it still would not exp lain why even being simply a great speaker would cause p eople to say he is the greatest “leader” of a gener ation, or “sent by g-d” or “JFK” and why that he should be trusted to make decisions like he has never made i n his life, or that he will bring change when he hasn’t r eally changed anything in his 46 years. What he ha s done does not logically fit how he is perceived. In fac t, the gulf is too wide to be random unexplained phenomenon. As shown, he does, however, use cleve r hypnosis techniques while discussing e.g. JFK to subconsciously transfer feelings conjured up in his audience onto him through, e.g. flashed hand gestu res which appear innocent to uncritical observation. Real “hypnosis” explained Most people are hypnotized and fall into trance eve ry day of their lives. 2 It is a common, every day occurrence, whether for a brief second, or minutes or longer. A very basic example is when you are dr iving a car while in deep thought, and you suddenly reali ze you are much further along with no memory of driving the whole distance. Another example, is wh en you are on an elevator watching the numbers chan ge and go into trance, and when everyone else gets off , you take that as a nonverbal suggestion to get of f, before you “wake up” and realize it is not your flo or. This elevator example is an example of mass hypnosis, where the close rapport with the hypnotis t is not necessary, because many people are both hypnotized partly by whatever is causing the trance , and partly by the fact that you are being “paced” or also hypnotized by everyone else in the elevator doing t he exact same thing as you. The reason you cry fro m reading sad book simply by reading ink on paper is because of the mind’s interaction with that informa tion, which is also a hypnotic process. 3 Two separate definitions of “hypnosis”: 1. First, hypnosis, is “a particular altered state of hyper-suggestibility brought about in an indivi dual by a combination of relaxation, fixation of attention, a nd suggestion.” 4 2. Second, hypnosis is also “bypassing the ‘critic al factor’ and setting up acceptable selective thin king. 5 ” The “critical factor” is the conscious part of the brain that you think with that has the ability to m ake rational logical judgments about what information is receive d. 6 The critical factor acts as a filter, determining what   2 Erickson maintained that trance is a common, every day occurrence. For example, when waiting for buses and trains, reading or listening, or even being involved in strenuous phys ical exercise, it's quite normal to become immersed in the activity and go into a trance state, removed from any other irrelevant sti muli. These states are so common and familiar that most people do not consciously recognize them as hypnotic phenomena. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_H._Erickson 3 The Power of Conversational Hypnosis, Clifford Mee and Igor Ledochowski 4 Modern Hypnosis, Theory and Practice, Masud Ansari , Ph.D. 5 Killer Influence Secrets of Covert Hypnosis, by Da vid X, Part 1, David X’s educational video, “How to Hypnotize with Covert Hypnosis and Hypnotic Language” See video online, such as at: http://www.revver.com/video/834827/how-to-hypnotize -with- covert-hypnosis-and-hypnotic-language/ 6 Killer Influence Secrets of Covert Hypnosis, by Da vid X, Part 1"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 7 can pass into the subconscious mind which is a non- rational computer-like system which accepts everyth ing in it as absolute truth. 7 That is why sidelining it is so dangerous. Milton Erickson, had a broader definition of the un conscious mind, described as, “both the functioning of the dominant hemisphere of the brain that occurs be low the level of awareness, as well as the function ing of the non-dominant hemisphere.” 8 Ericksonian trance induction has three dimensions w hich we will return to often and compare to Obama’s language patterns. They are: 9 1. Pacing and distraction of the dominant (language ) hemisphere; 2. Utilization of the dominant hemisphere, language processing which occurs below the level of awareness; 3. Accessing of the non-dominant hemisphere; This above three part process is extremely importan t to later analysis. Essentially, hypnosis is an a ltered and common state of mind involving intense focus, s idelining or disassociation of the rational critica l thinking, and the state of hyper-suggestibility bro ught about while the subconscious mind is the domin ant player. 10 It happens while reading, listening to music, and even while hearing a great speaker. 11 However, the power of such methods is what is diffi cult to grasp. What we are talking about is “transformational linguistics” – language that lite rally changes who you are at your deepest levels, y our deepest passions, drives, and emotions while you ar e completely unaware. Under Freud, there is the conscious mind that you t hink with, called the “ ego.” You also have a conscience, called the “ super-ego.” Then, there is the largest part of the psyche, th e id , which is the back-end of all our memory, our most basic instincts and drives, emotio ns, and suppressed desires. 12 “The unconscious mind is the source of our energy, and no amount of consciou s reasoning can override it. The unconscious mind is un-critical, it accepts as absolute truth any idea that is allowed to enter its computer-like system” 13 The messages of hypnosis, including mass hypnosis, can be far more powerful than just someone’s conscious thoughts, as it affects their most basic biological drives and instincts. 14 That is why many of Obama’s followers are so passionate for him, why they are f ainting in his presence, comparing him to Jesus, an d supporting him like no other candidate before.   7 Killer Influence Secrets of Covert Hypnosis, by Da vid X, Part 1 8 Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H.

Erickson, also known as the father of modern hypnosis method, was the single greatest practitioner of hypnosis, having dramatically advan ced the field. 15 Dr. Erickson is internationally acclaimed as the leading practitioner in the field of hypnosi s 16 for his understanding of the science of both induc ing and utilizing hypnotic states. 17 Dr. Erickson discovered while working as a therapis t, that he could hide therapeutic hypnosis within t he normal content of an inconspicuous conversation wit h the patient, and avoid much of the patient’s cons cious resistance that normally accompanied hypnotherapy. 18 Dr. Erickson realized the subconscious mind was always listening, and understood better than anyone before how to access it, and implant suggestions i nto it. What Dr. Erickson did was figure out how to put peo ple into trance and hypnotize them and implant suggestions with seemingly normal conversation. He discovered that people could achieve this heighten ed state of hyper-suggestibility without the tradition al difficultly-induced coma-like state traditionall y associated with hypnosis. Though his pioneering un derstanding, he was able to do the same and much mo re often with simple plays on words and embedded meani ngs in a single sentence. The entire field of “covert hypnosis”, or “conversa tional hypnosis” is based on Dr. Erickson’s techniq ues, and is now primarily used by hypnotists and psychia trists. 19 Conversational hypnosis is often referred to as Ericksonian hypnosis. The word “hypnosis” is never mentioned and there is nothing overt to give away that hypnosis is being used. It is impossible to detect unless you know precisely what to look for. Hack versions of these techniques are unfortunately taught to be used as persuasion tools for salespersons, and even more unfortunately also for men looking to enhance their success picking up and seducing with women. The reason this is so unfortunate, is because cover t hypnosis is designed to sideline rational judgmen t. That is fundamental to how it works; to bypass the domin ant hemisphere and critical factor. It essentially tricks the subconscious mind into accepting commands as ab solute truths which include not only those approved by the conscious mind, but outside commands from a hypnotist who can implant any suggestion he wishes. Dr. Erickson was adamant that only doctors be allow ed to practice his techniques because of how strong ly he felt about how dangerous such science could be i n the wrong hands. Subconscious suggestions are more powerful than eve n what the subject believes consciously – as such suggestions become parts of their deepest psyche. Because covert hypnosis is hidden in ordinary speec h,   15 Milton E. Erickson, often looked at as the father of modern day hypnosis understanding, was founding president of the American Society for Clinical Hypnosis and a fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, the Ameri can Psychological Association, and the American Psychopathological As sociation. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_H._Erickson He felt very strongly that the field of hypnosis should only be allowed to be studied by doctors because of its pow er. 16 Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. E rickson, M.D. Volume 1, p1. 17 Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. E rickson, M.D. Volume 1, p1. 18 Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. E rickson, M.D. Volume 1, p25 “by communicating indir ectly, Dr. Erickson avoids the issue of resistance to a large extent.” “Erickson believed that the unconscious mind was always listening, and that hypnosis could be used whether the patient was awar e of it or completely oblivious to the fact that a hypnotic technique was being used. Erickson would see if the patient would resp ond to one or another kind of indirect suggestion, and allow the unconscious mind to actively participate in the therapeutic pro cess. In this way, what seemed like a normal conve rsation might induce a hypnotic trance, or a therapeutic change in the sub ject. Andre M. Weitzenhoffer (1976) Introduction/f orward in Hypnotic Realities Erickson & Rossi. It is called conversat ional hypnosis because the subtleties are slipped i nto a conversation and the other person would not consciously realize it, whil e the tactics could have a very real subconscious e ffect.” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_H._Erickson 19 Sometimes the field is called “black-ops” hypnosis ."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 9 and the subject is not aware that it is being used, it is even more powerful than ordinary hypnosis. Since the conscious mind is not even aware of the messages be ing sent, conscious scrutiny and resistance is eliminated. 20 The subject cannot even question the messages be ing sent – they are simply implanted by the hypnotist as the subject’s most fundamental beliefs . Then, even the subject’s own rational mind canno t overpower them. Bypassing the dominant hemisphere’s rational judgme nt (“critical factor”) The critical factor is the part of the mind that lo gically analyzes and scrutinizes all information li ke a filter, and decides what information is allowed to pass int o your subconscious mind and become part of what yo ur mind accepts as unquestionably true, like your deep est and most powerful emotions, drives, and instinc ts. 21 It is the primary cognitive defense that usually st ops all information and rationally analyzes it, whe ther consciously or unconsciously. It keeps your comput er-like subconscious mind from literally believing that you are a chicken when someone calls you a “chicken ”, and keeps you from literally believing that you are a square (box) when somebody calls you a “square”, an d keeps you from literally believing you are a (sno w or cereal) flake when somebody calls you a “flake.” you don’t consciously ponder it when someone call s you a chicken, your critical fator stops that infor mation below the level of awareness. The critical factor is the cognitive function best analogized to a security guard (critical factor) wh o searches every person (information) entering into a nightclu b looking for weapons. (and stops all information t hat is questionable) 22 The critical factor stops all information and all ows your thinking and rationality to determine whether it is acceptable to the subconsci ous mind or not. Hypnosis uses language patterns, visual tricks, bod y language, voice, tone, and other aspects of communication to get “suggestions” past the critica l factor part of the brain and directly into the li stener’s subconscious. 23 This is wonderful if the command is to be free of a phobia, or quit smoking. The reason hypnosis is used for such psychological change, is that the critical factor allows in only what it acc epts as true. Without bypassing the smoker’s critical fact or, a smoker has a difficult time quitting because they have a difficult time accepting as absolutely true the information that they are a nonsmoker, because their critical factor and conscious mind knows differentl y and doesn’t let the information through. How one might simplify this point, is, in normal ev eryday life, calling someone a “chicken” will not c ause them to literally believe they are a chicken and ac t like one. This is because the critical factor st ops this information from passing into the subconscious. So how can a hypnotist get a subject to cluck like a chicken believing they are one? The hypnotist know s how to get the hypnotic suggestion that the subje ct is a chicken past the critical factor part of the cons ciousness, and get the subconscious mind to accept it as unquestionably true.   20 Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H.

I t is perhaps the biggest fraud and deception in Ame rican history. Most of our beliefs come to us from our own rationa l judgment and conscious analysis of the world. Fo r example, we know it good to wake up in the morning and do something because we rationally know the consequences of staying in bed all day. When we li ke people, it is usually due to a combination of ou r rational judgment and how that person naturally mak es us feel about them. We try to make people like us more by following social norms, making people feel good, smiling, and so on. However, a very small percentage of the population actually study subconscious manipulation of not onl y how people feel about them, but how to manipulate a nd alter the beliefs we usually come to by our rati onal judgment, reason, and experience. These people stu dy specifically how to sideline this rational judgm ent, reason, and experience, and natural feelings, and b end people’s feelings and will through the applicat ion of this branch of psychiatry to their interactions. Obama is an expert at this type of artificial manip ulation. His ability to convince rationally and an y natural “charm” is only part of how a person feels about Ob ama. The rest is deceptive subconscious manipulati on. His tactics are deceptive because he has mastered t he science and art of lowering the effects of the r ational scrutiny parts of the mind through his speaking, ac tions, and presentation. He gets you to believe no t by convincing you rationally until you decide to belie ve it, but by knowing how to say to your subconscio us mind literally the words that “you believe ” in a way that your subconscious mind will simply accept the message and believe without having rationally decid ed to believe. He knows how to say to your subconscious mind that it “chose” (Obama) even when it hasn’t, in a way that you will believe that you have chosen. He understands subconscious manipulation e nough to know how to talk about families, and your children, and John F. Kennedy, and conjure up feeli ngs within you from speaking in certain rhythmic an d unnaturally slow tempos, and then subconsciously t ransfer the emotions he conjures up onto him, such as with hand gestures or hidden content in language. You genuinely walk away from him feeling warm, and viewing him as a JFK, except it is artificial. He knows how to say one thing, but have your subconsci ous mind ultra-powerfully receive a different message a nd feeling than you are aware of. He is actually implanting feelings and emotions into your subconsc ious. They feel like your own. Rationally he is a n unaccomplished man with shady connections, but you are tricked into feelings about him that overpower   24 Also distinguished, are common political tactics. Such tactics, like making sure there is a Presiden tial podium in front of you, and American flags behind you to make you look Pres idential. While they send messages, they are not a nalogous to the deceptive and unprecedented hypnosis used by Obama that is th e focus of this document."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 11 those, that feel like your genuine feelings about h im because they come from inside you, implanted int o the deepest parts of your psyche. Obama’s deception here is not simply a few sublimin al messages like those used in some advertisements. Obama is employing with art and skill a complex hid den system applying a multitude of the most advance d techniques in subconscious manipulation known to ps ychology. This entire system is designed to do one thing - to make us feel like the decision to suppor t Obama is our own when it is really, at least for many, implanted artificially through hypnosis. What Obama is doing is in effect the same as if he dangled a silver watch in front of us and said “you are getting sleepy and going into trance....you have an unstoppable urge that you cannot resist.....you mu st vote for Barack.” In fact, as discussed below, Obama wa s actually caught at least once saying something ve ry similar with his own lips. Yes, Obama was caught g iving an overt hypnotic command to vote for him. 25 People even made fun of it, but nobody realized it was actual intentional hypnosis until it is now exp lained. (see below) Hypnotizing someone without their knowledge is the height of immorality. The level of deception invol ved here, in Obama’s use of covert hypnosis, and his pr esumption that he has the right to use hypnosis on us to gain votes is just unconscionable. If a stranger c ame up to you in a restaurant and tried to hypnotiz e you to get you to do anything, even so much as buy them a cup of coffee, and you figured out that they were t rying to use actual hypnosis on you, you would run. If Obama simply lied, we voters would be able to us e our rational judgment to make a logical decision about what is the truth, and what we should believe, and what we shouldn’t. However, because he is implanti ng subconscious commands we are not aware of conscious ly, into the deepest parts of our emotional and subconscious psyches, he is actually taking away ou r ability to make those rational judgments. He is making the decision to and taking away even our abi lity to question the commands he is hypnotizing us with. We never even know the commands are being im planted (until now with this document), and we are tricked into believing that our feelings are coming from deep inside us. Obama’s concealment of his hypnotic techniques can only be looked at as decept ion. 26 The passion people feel for Obama is real because i t comes from deep inside each of them. Thus, logic al arguments against Obama become irrelevant. To all those who were wondering what the impaired rational judgment of millions of people looks like, here it is. It doesn’t matter that he has no accomplishmen ts, never takes hard positions, or that he changes to o pposite positions from almost one day to the next, or has long term connections to extremists, racists, and o ther shady people, is endorsed by Iran and Hamas, a nd simply says he didn’t know the character of his own pastor and mentor for twenty years. The logic of this disturbing information is on the conscious level, a nd cannot override the subconscious nor change how his supporters feel internally. 27 Many may be somewhat bothered by it logically, bu t it hasn’t changed how   25 See below, regarding Obama’s Statement featured in McCain ad, “The One”, - Obama’s hypnotic command t hat “a light will shine down from somewhere, it will light upon you, you will experience an epiphany, and you will say t o yourself, ‘I have to vote for Barack’” – criticized for its being ridiculousn ess probably without even awareness that it is hypn osis. 26 “Deception (also called beguilement or subterfuge ) is the act of convincing another to believe infor mation that is not true, or not the whole truth as in certain types of half-truths . Deception involves concepts like propaganda , distraction and/or concealment.” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception 27 “The unconscious mind is the source of our energy.

The fact that he has c hanged nearly every position from the primaries to the general election doesn’t register in us consciously what it should – that this unknown man can just as easily change the day after he is sworn in as President an d be anyone he chooses, including a very different person than he has been portraying. Now, what sounds like frightening science fiction i s reality. Someone whom we really don’t know, who is unaccomplished, with many shady connections and sup porters, is trying to use hypnosis on millions to g et us all to turn over control of the world’s largest nuclear arsenal to him, and he is about to succeed. The study of the effects of mass hypnosis A widely held view among psychologists and experts is that conversational hypnosis is literally a form of mind control. One author says: “Essentially conversational hypnosis allow users to gain control of their subjects mind through spoken word, and literally get them to do as they w ish - within reason of course. Essentially the English language has various emotional triggers and tone's which can be utilised to induce people into a trance. When people are in such a trance it is possible to alter their views and control their actions.” 28 Some video examples of the power of hypnosis are in cluded in the footnotes. 29 However, this particular one at this footnote at the end of this sentence of hyp notist Derren Brown is amazing, and very exemplary of how conversational hypnosis works, and is highly re commended for a quick understanding. 30 To give you an idea of the power of hypnosis in the wrong hands , hypnosis can be used to get a complete stranger t o hand over a wallet in seconds. 31 MSNBC 32 and BBC 33 reports a man stealing from stores and banks using hypnosis.

One of the most absorbing aspects of this whole pro blem of hypnosis is the question of whether people can be forced to commit crimes, such as murd er or treason, while under a hypnotic spell. Many psychologists would deny that such a thing cou ld happen and would insist that no person can be compelled to do under hypnosis what he would ref use to do in a state of alert consciousness. But actually what a person can be compelled to do depen ds on the degree of dependency that hypnosis causes and the frequency of repetition of the so-ca lled posthypnotic suggestions. 35 Rape of the Mind discusses psychological conditioni ng from World War II Nazi tactics, to Soviet Cold-W ar theoreticians, to our own democracy. (See Chapter 2 – Mass Conditioning Through Speech, and Political Conditioning. 36 The Book also discusses the dangers of the real p henomenon of mass hypnosis: Suggestion and hypnosis are considered by some to b e a psychological blessing, but they can also be the beginning of terror. Mass hypnosis, for example , can have a dangerous influence on the individual. Psychiatrists have found several times that public demonstrations of mass hypnosis may provoke an increased hypnotic dependency and submis siveness in many members of the audience that can last for years. Largely for this reason Gr eat Britain has passed a law making seances and mass hypnotism illegal. Hypnosis may act as a trigg er mechanism for a repressed dependency need in the victim and turn him temporarily into a kind of waking sleep-walker and mental slave. The hypnotic command relieves him of his personal respo nsibility, and he surrenders much of his conscience to his hypnotizer. As we mentioned befor e, our own times have provided us with far too many examples of how political hypnosis, mob hypnos is, and even war hypnosis can turn civilized men into criminals. Pavlov’s theory of psychology also says that propag anda can create mass hypnosis, and people can becom e conditioned to verbal or other symbols used in prop aganda. Such masses can lose their discretion and be easily influenced. 37 For Americans to presume that we are not subject to any propaganda just because we are Americans is insufficient logic. Illegality of Obama’s use of hypnosis Hypnosis-type mental pressure has been held by the Supreme Court of the United States to be so unduly influential as to deprive someone of their fundamen tal rights. The US Supreme court case was Leyra v. Denno, 347 U.S. 556 (1954), Leyra v. Denno, No. 635 , Argued April 28, 1954, Decided June 1, 1954, 347 U.S. 556. After police questioned a suspect day an d night unable to obtain a confession, a hypnotist tried, and did successfully get the suspect to confess. T he legal battles over whether the confession was vo luntary or not, undue influence or not, went all the way to the Supreme court of the United States, which deci ded that his confession could not be used as evidence a gainst him in court.

Hypnosis on a non-consenting person may arguably co nstitute fraud 38 , undue influence, and/or potentially other violations of the law, depending on the juris diction. 39 Undue influence is “persuasion that overcomes the will without convincing the judgment.” 40 Hypnosis works on mental and emotional weaknesses fitting the legal definition precisely. For example, with hypnotizing someone to get access to that person’s bank account – even the hypnotist makes the person belie ve they want to do it, they are using techniques wh ich create an undue influence on the person. The Executive Committee of the American Psychologic al Association Division of Psychological Hypnosis has said, “clinical hypnosis should be used only by properly trained and credentialed health care professionals (e.g. licensed clinical psychologists ), who have also been trained in the clinical use o f hypnosis and are working within the areas of their professional expertise.” The Appellate Division of the Los Angeles County Superior Court has held that pra ctice of hypnotism as curative measure or mode of procedure by one not licensed to practice medicine amounts t o unlawful practice of medicine. 41 What Obama is doing is making some people’s support of him in this election not of our own free will. He us using hidden techniques so we cannot even questi on the commands he is slipping into our subconsciou s. Many genuinely want to support him like smokers wan t a cigarette, and as smokers, we find the logic to justify how we feel. The hypnosis technique of “pacing and leading” to s ideline rational judgment In a nutshell, “pacing and leading” is using hypnos is to bypass the critical factor. By bypassing the cognitive functions that would normally critically analyze and scrutinize information, the hypnotist t ricks the patient’s subconscious mind into accepting exte rnal information from the hypnotist into the subconscious, as a hypnotic suggestion, as absolute ly true. It is a more powerful implant of informat ion than even the subject can usually communicate to th emselves with his or her own thoughts. Pacing and leading is a fundamental tool in convers ational or covert hypnosis. 42 Normally only what you consciously know to be true is allowed to pass. If you are a smoker, but tell yourself consciously th at you   38 Fraud does not require an express false statement, though subconscious connections to JFK and the lik e are clearly that. Fraud can also constitute withholding information in some cases, such as when there is a duty to disclose. 39 One article by Peter C. Johnson, describes convers ational hypnosis as mind control - http://ezinearticles.com/?Cant-Control- Your-Children?-Learn-Conversational-Hypnosis&id=959 004 - While stating it is “not illegal” in his opinion , this example is relating to using it to get your children to do thi ngs, and he cannot make a statement on what is lega l across a spectrum of varied situations, including the use of hypnosis to get po litical support, votes and campaign contributions. 40 Undue influence is “Undue influence, in the sense we are concerned with here, is a shorthand legal ph rase used to describe persuasion which tends to be coercive in nature, pe rsuasion which overcomes the will without convincin g the judgment. (Estate of Ricks, 160 Cal. 467, 480-482, 117 P. 539.) The hall mark of such persuasion is high pressure, a pressur e which works on mental, moral, or emotional weakness to such an extent that it approaches the boundaries of coercion. In this sense, undue influence has been called overpersuasion. Kelly v. McCarthy, 6 Ca l.2d 347, 364, 57 P.2d 118.” Odorizzi v.

Thus even you can’t get informati on past your own critical factor. Dr. Erickson discovered that through pacing, a hypn otist could neutralize the filter of a person’s cri tical factor so he can slip suggestions past the critical factor into the subconscious. 43 “Pacing” can be almost any technique by which a hyp notist gets your critical factor to lower its criti cal analysis and scrutiny of the information you are re ceiving. The “lead” is the new information, suggestion, or c ommand the hypnotist wants to implant. When done effectively, the hypnotist can “lead” – i mplant suggestions and commands that pass through i nto your subconscious that will be taken as unquestiona bly true. 44 The lead can be something you are aware of such as a statement you hear, or it can be embedded , hidden, something you are completely unaware of consciously, yet still pass through into your subco nscious. The word “suggestion” is used in hypnosis , but it is not a suggestion as we think of one, that we con sider and rationalize. “Suggestion” in the hypnosi s world is actually a suggestion into the subconscious, som ething your mind will take as unquestionably true, thus, in effect, more powerful than even a command as we use this term. How pacing is done: Working with our analogy, if many people entering t he club are searched by the security guard and noth ing questionable is found, the security guard’s defense efforts become tired, lazy, and lowered. Normally though, everything in our world is questionable kee ping the critical factor sharp and alert. The hypn otist paces the subject by providing the mind with inform ation that is undeniably true, something the subjec t strongly believes, or is absolutely and immediately verifiable, in successive patterns until the subje ct’s guard is lowered. This pacing can take the form of almost any informa tion that serves as an accurate representation of t he subject’s current ongoing experience, including wha t they see, what they hear, what they truly believe , and describing or imitating the subject’s conscious exp erience or even subconscious experience, such as th eir breathing. 45 Breathing is a common pace in hypnosis. Breathin g is something conscious when we are focused on it, but when we do not focus on it, we d o not stop breathing, it is simply taken over by th e subconscious mind. Often times, just the mention o f “breathing” is sufficient to bring the activity i nto conscious focus for seconds or minutes, until such focus is not needed and the subconscious takes over it again. Pacing can be such as obvious statements the subjec t truly believes or knows are true, or subconscious act/messages that the hypnotist does which the subj ect is not even aware of, e.g. mimicking or describ ing   43 Killer Influence Secrets of Covert Hypnosis, by Da vid X, Part 1 44 Killer Influence Secrets of Covert Hypnosis, by Da vid X, Part 1 David X’s educational video, “How to Hypnotize with Covert Hypnosis and Hypnotic Language” See video online, such as at: http://www.revver.com/video/834827/how-to-hypnotize -with- covert-hypnosis-and-hypnotic-language/ Essentially, David X summarizes the conversatio nal hypnosis process as: 1. Capturing focus, 2. bypassing the critical facto r/thinking, 3. activating an unconscious or emotion al response, (emotional people will not reason) and 4. leading those respon ses to the outcome the hypnotist desires. 45 Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H.

Commonly, the hypnotist describes the e xperiences, sights, thoughts, and feelings the subj ect is having. 46 This is not just a politician saying what his audie nce is sure to agree with. The hypnotist purposely describes absolute truths on multiple levels relate d to the subject’s current reality, and thereby tri cks the subject’s critical factor into lowering its guard a nd gets the subject to accept the hypnotist as a so urce for information to be taken into the subconscious as ab solutely true. The brain regularly absorbs representations of the subject’s current ongoing experience, what the subj ect sees, hears, feels, as a natural part of communicat ion between the conscious and subconscious mind. P acing works by disguising information as part of the subj ect’s ongoing verifiable experience to trick the cr itical factor into letting that information pass through t o the subconscious. By repeatedly providing information to the subject that the subject genuinely believes to be true, the hypnotist disguises himself as a source for absolut ely true information acceptable to your subconsciou s. The hypnotic commands of the hypnotist can be disgu ised as information being communicated in between the conscious and unconscious mind of the subject. The subject trusts this information believing it i s approved by the conscious mind, and the command sli ps through the critical factor of one person hypnotized, or millions watching on TV. Unknowingly to the conscious mind, when this happen s, the lead, or the new information from the hypnot ist is accepted as absolutely true, and becomes part of the subject’s deepest beliefs. 47 Specific examples of Obama using 14 separate hypnot ic pacing statements in his Denver 2008 Convention speech Elementary pacing examples from Obama include, “now is the time”, and “as I stand here before you.” These statements are undeniably true in the simples t terms and commonly used parts of his pacing techniques, because of course now is the time, and if he is there speaking, of course he is standing b efore us. These are things the hypnotist says that are verifi ably true, and used to lower our critical factor de fenses to allow implantation of subconscious messages. Looking at “pacing” statements alone, Obama’s 2008 Democratic National Convention Speech in Denver 48 uses them throughout. Yet, nobody suspects these l anguage patterns to be anything other than an innoc ent part of his powerful speech. Three of Obama’s favorite hypnotic paces are “that’ s why I stand here tonight”, “now is the time”, and “this moment.” Just these three pacing statements are u sed by Obama a total of fourteen (14) times through out this single speech. In this speech, Obama essentially said “as I stand before you tonight” three separate times, around th e beginning, middle, and end of the speech to continu e pacing the audience throughout, as follows:   46 Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H.

That's why I stand here tonight. Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive. 2. The fundamentals we use to measure economic stre ngth are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country grea t - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight. 3. But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring. What the nay- sayers don't understand is that this election has n ever been about me. It's been about you. In the same speech, Obama says “now is the time” si x times throughout. While he phrase is apparent, i t sounds to everyone like just his power-phrase or th eme for the speech. 1. Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that dril ling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution. Not even close. 2. Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide ev ery child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. 3. Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessi ble health care for every single American. 4. Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better fa mily leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent. 5. Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensio ns are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security fo r future generations. 6. And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day' s work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons. It is no coincidence that he happens to use these p hrases that are subconscious pacing statements beca use they are immediately and verifiably true by their m ost simplistic terms, and cause the subconscious to accept the hypnotist as a source for such absolute truth. Obama also says essentially “this moment” five time s, serving the same pacing purpose. 1. We meet at one of those defining moments - a mo ment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threaten ed once more. 2. This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21 st century, the American promise alive. 3. You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one , the change we need doesn't come from Washington. 4. America, this is one of those moments . 5. At this moment , in this election, we must pledge once more to mar ch into the future Notice how for each instance without exception, he has words before or after “moment” to make it absolutely immediately and verifiably true, such as “we meet at”, or “this election”, moments “like th is one”, or “this is one of those moments.” The notio n that this is all also a coincidence is absurd. T his is carefully crafted hidden hypnotic pacing. And, thi s is only the beginning. Obama put these 14 pacing hypnotic language pattern s into his speech knowing them to be part of a hypnotic trance induction. It is not “just the way he talks” nor “coincidence.” A more detailed play by play analysis of Obama’s hypnosis techniques in this and other speeches is below."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 18 Obama uses a variety of other statements nobody can disagree with as pacing statements. More simplist ic are statements like “we need change 49 ”, “We are the hope of our future,” and “Yes we can .” 50 They are logically meaningless but they hit a chord, a subco nscious chord, especially in younger people, and ar e his most powerful words. See the analysis on vagueness and trans-derivation below. However, such pacing statements alone are only a sm all part of the complex hypnotic trance induction Obama intentionally uses. Embedded and hidden meanings – “deep structure” of language vs “surface structure” Most people do not realize Obama is using hypnosis because everything he does is below the radar – hid den inside normal speech. 51 There is nothing special about these words or phr ases to give them away as “hypnosis.” The general public does not have an un derstanding of the field, and Obama is hoping that these explanations will be too difficult for the general public to understand, and too complex for the media to try and explain. In fact, Obama is counting on the med ia to do what it has done for the past few election s – control their coverage to keep the race as close to even as possible until the end, making the story e xciting, so that the effects of Obama’s hypnosis triggered i n the voting booth will push him over the edge to v ictory. The communications we are aware of are called the “ surface structure” – that is what the subject hears and realizes. The science of hypnosis requires underst anding the “deep structure” of what the subject see s, hears, and experiences – the communication that is designed for our subconscious to receive. our brai ns delete, change, distort, and jumble content on its way to the subconscious mind. Hypnotists speak in a manner to put us into trance, and then intentionall y send “deep structure” communications designed for only our subconscious minds without conscious awareness. 52 While below is an example of hidden pacing, imbedde d commands in all aspects of hypnosis serve the purpose of making commands to the client indirectly , and thereby avoiding resistance. 53 Indirect suggestion is such a pivotal part of conversational hypnosis, that entire hypnosis practice manuals have been wri tten precisely on indirect suggestion techniques. 54 Obama has used as part of pacing, statements such a s “we rise and(or) fall as one nation.” That sound s powerful and true. In fact it is something no one can argue with, as all pacing is. But why the “or fall” part if he is trying to be optimistic? The hidden subco nscious effect is that Obama is pacing us in a hidd en way we don’t even realize. 55 Remember, pacing is something that is unquestiona bly true and is an accurate   49 For “change we can believe in” – the word “believe ” is key – it is one of the most powerful words in hypnosis, and a word anchored continually by Obama’s apparently innocent hand gestures. 50 The Illinois senator sprinkles speeches with “we” and “you” – “Yes we can” and “you have done what th e cynics said we couldn’t do” – as if he were as much guiding a move ment as running for president.

It is not just that the nation rises and falls, b ut as we breathe, our chest “rises and falls.” 56 We are not aware of it consciously, but with this statement we are being subconsciously paced by Obama’s words. 57 Thus, without even realizing it, Obama elicits a subconscious response - us subconsciously increasin gly seeing Obama as a source of acceptable absolute truth. Notice how Obama rarely if ever asks for our vote i n his speeches. (or money) After repeated and continual pacing an entire audience of millions wit h statements that are undoubtedly true that lower o ur critical factors’ defenses, Obama just slips in the hypnotic command (the lead) e.g. ...“and that is w hy I will be your next President.” The hyper-confidence Obama uses, after having used multiple language patterns to lower rational defens es, is because he must speak in a way that your subcons cious mind will have no reason to doubt. This does not raise suspicion because politicians generally have to sound over-confident, e.g. saying they will win. The reason Obama sounds so hyper-confident with certain language patterns is because he has to in order to input a command effectively so your subconscious ta kes it as absolute truth. 58 How Ericksonian “linking statements” mimic the way the brain accepts information After pacing you repeatedly in multiple ways and on multiple levels as described above, and thus lower ing your cognitive critical factor defenses, the hypnot ist will implant a “lead” - the command or absolute unquestionable truth he places in your subconscious . Essentially, the pace or truth is connected to t he new hypnotic message or “lead” using connecting or link ing language. Paces are connected to the lead thro ugh the use of the linking words including “and”, “as”, and “because” or “that is why.” 59 The latter linking words each being increasingly more powerful than th e former, especially the ones containing an element of causation, because causation mirrors the way the su bconscious mind accepts information. 60 61 62 Saying, for one example: “We need change...and ...that is why I will be your next President.” is a basic pace and lead. No person can disagree with “we need cha nge.” Change is inevitable anyway, certainly when problems exist. However, the fact that change will happen, or that we need change, has absolutely not hing to do with being a valid reason why the choice for President should be none other than Barack Obama.   56 See Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H.

Same when Obama describes how bad the economy is, and how bad government is, and then follows with “and that is why I want to be your next President.” When he has only listed problems, the logical derivative is on ly that someone who is good at solving those problems shoul d be President. But he has not made any logical argument as to why it should be him . As a Harvard attorney, Obama knows clearly that his speeches have faulty logic. But the use of these basic words as hypnotic linking statements in your subcon scious, connects an absolute truth you believe deep ly, from a (now) trusted source of absolute truths, to a new message that is slipped past the critical fac tor because it comes from the same trusted source, usin g the fundamental way your brain understands information. The subject walks away believing we need change, therefore we need Obama. It doesn’t matter whether the cause and effect linking statement has any truth or logical connection to it. 63 It works because it links statements the subject knows subconsciously to be t rue, with statements from the hypnotist, that the hypnotist tricks the subconscious mind to believe a re connected, and thus also absolutely true at the subconscious level. Basics of Obama’s pacing and leading: The “because we need change, that is why I should be your next president” argument Building on this basic framework, you do not hear s pecifics largely because much of Obama’s entire presentation is pacing the audience. Obama’s sente nce structure is often exactly what is taught by Er ickson in ways that cannot be coincidence. If he went int o specifics, he would not be pacing, he would be encouraging the use of the conscious mind, somethin g he is attempting to avoid. Obama’s entire campai gn, essentially, can be summarized as: 1. The economy is bad, or the country is going in t he wrong direction (pace) or we need to get an education for every child (whatever statements no o ne can disagree with (pace) and therefore creates a “yes-yes-yes” response, or “yes room.”) 64 2. Change (can be used as a pace, an anchor, and/or a preprogrammed response) 3. And or because or that is why (conjunction linki ng statement) 65 4. I will be your next President. (subconscious lea d) Saying that things are bad and we need change is on ly a logical basis for the conclusion that we need someone able to solve our current problems for Pres ident – but the suggestion that the person to do th is is Obama is rationally under-supported or entirely uns upported. It doesn’t matter though, because the connection is made on the subconscious level throug h the use of linking statements applied precisely p er Ericksonian techniques. Obama says he offers hope, but actually much of Oba ma’s pacing is negative, e.g. based on how negative things are. In fact, anger works well as an emotio n with which to change behavior through hypnosis. Notice how Obama rarely if ever smiles during the s ubstantive parts within his formal hypnotic speeche s.   63 Killer Influence Secrets of Covert Hypnosis, by Da vid X, Part 1 64 The Power of Conversational Hypnosis, Clifford Mee and Igor Ledochowski , p35/631 65 Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H.

Obama says he is the person with judgment, and he s ays he is the person to solve our problems because he recognizes what is wrong, but these are logically empty argum ents. His arguments based on his “ability to see” what is wrong provides no real logical basis. His point is no more advanced nor specific than th e average listener’s viewpoint. He opposed the war i n Iraq in 2003, but so did half the world, logicall y, making Obama no more qualified than half the planet to be President. However, because he uses pacing and leading so effectively, he says, “because we need c hange, that is why I want to be your next President ” - it is absorbed into the subconscious as absolute truth. The fact that this argument has no logic is irrelev ant to such feelings. Similarly, just because Obama powe rfully says “its time for new energy and new ideas” doesn’t mean he actually has any new ideas, but thr ough his hypnotic techniques, that’s what people wa lk away feeling. \u0001 Obama’s speeches as one big hypnotic trance inducti on using extra slow speech, rhythm, tonalities, vagueness, visual imagery, metaphor, an d raising of emotion Everyone knows the sensation of hanging on Obama’s every word as he speaks. It is no accident. In fa ct, Obama intends to speak in such a way that it is alm ost impossible to listen at all without hanging on his every word. His unnaturally slow, rhythmical, four to eight word phrases with huge pauses after, are delivered to be complete ideas by themselves on som e level, even though only part of a sentence or complete thought. He is sensitive to exactly how t o speak to fixate your attention based on his understanding of hypnosis. Obama’s speeches often use an unnaturally slow lang uage to start. Unnaturally slow speech is a common hypnotic technique in order to allow the subject ti me to respond to suggestions, imagine images, and f eel sensations conjured by the hypnotist. 68 The unnaturally slow speech holds focus intensely , because the mind waits for new input, and is meanwhile left ana lyzing what it has just heard. Absorbing attention is about making sure people’s thoughts are what you se t out for them. The intense focus of the conscious mind frees the subconscious mind to act beyond norm al constraints of what the conscious mind thinks is real or normal or even proper. 69 Hypnosis is so closely aligned with this super in tense focus on a single thing that the study of mesmerism actually almost r enamed hypnosis “monoideaism” – mono for one, and   66 See discussion and images below regarding his Demo cratic Convention Speech for 2008 67 The Power of Conversational Hypnosis, Clifford Mee and Igor Ledowchowski, p104 of 631 68 How To Perform Hypnosis, by: William Hewitt, The Llewellyn Encyclopedia, http://www.llewellynencyclopedia.com/article/225 You do need to give some thought and practice to t he pace of your speech. The speech pattern needs to be slow enough to give the subject time to respond to your directions and yet fast enough to retain his or her attention and interest. If you go too slow, the subject’s mind will most likely wander to other thoughts. You want to maintain the subject’s attention to your voice. You will find that some people need a faster pace whil e others need a slower pace. Experience will help you find just the right pace. A pause of two to five seconds is a good average. 69 The Power of Conversational Hypnosis, Clifford Mee and Igor Ledochowski , p33/631"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 22 ideaism for idea. 70 We all know what it is like to go along with our im aginations on the ride Obama takes us on with his powerful metaphors, and captivating visual images a nd sensations, and passionate emotion as his speech es accelerate from unnaturally slow, into fireworks. Being hypnotized is enjoyable, reportedly affecting both serotonin and endorphins in the body. 71 Per the definition of hypnosis by Dr. Ansari, hypno sis is essentially the subject’s fixation of attent ion, and while in that state of hyper-suggestability, receiv ing a suggestion from the hypnotist. Every type of hypnotic induction involves a fixation of attention , which is what Obama accomplishes with his extraordinarily slow and rhythmical and powerful sp eech pattern, hand gestures, and logo, always prese nt on his podium, small and barely noticeable (conscio usly). Hypnotists use a rhythm of phrases of few words, us ually approximately four to eight word phrases, alm ost like a melody, not just because it holds attention. Such rhythm to be used is taught as part of conve rsational hypnosis. 72 The “melody” of words delivered by the hypnotist in almost a music like fashion accesses the non-dominant hemisphere because that is where music is interpreted. 73 A hypnotist can become a master of using rate of speaking, tonalities, and pauses to c ommunicate indirect suggestions. Hypnotists also u se tonality and changes in tonality while speaking to hypnotize and send subconscious messages. 74 Based on Erickson’s advancements, entire works have been wri tten just on indirect suggestion, hidden meanings within language, and communicate of those hidden me anings to only the subconscious mind of the subject . 75 The use of Ericksnian “vagueness” in speech as a li nguistic induction tool: “Change” and “Yes we can.” We all know Obama continually uses vague statements without being specific of their meaning, including “yes we can”, and “change.” In fact, he gets audie nces to chant them. Remember the three dimensions of Ericksonian trance induction discussed above: 1. Pacing and distraction of the dominant (language ) hemisphere; 2. Utilization of the dominant hemisphere, language processing which occurs below the level of awareness; 3. Accessing of the non-dominant hemisphere; A statement that we hear consciously contains only one surface structure (unless we do a double-take a nd realize a secondary meaning). However, one such st atement can contain multiple deep structure meaning s to our subconscious. 76 The process by which the mind searches between al ternate meanings is called trans-   70 The Power of Conversational Hypnosis, Clifford Mee and Igor Ledochowski , p33/631 71 Marshall Sylver, Hypnotist 72 The Power of Conversational Hypnosis, Clifford Mee and Igor Ledochowski, p94 of 631, The performance element of hypnosis: Rhythm and tone (regarding using rhythm i n conversational hypnosis to be more compelling by being almost music- like) 73 Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H.

The searching through these various me anings is part of what distracts the rational part of the mind as part of hypnotic induction, even if we are not consciously aware of our search between differe nt meanings. This trans-derivational search occurs be low the level of awareness. A vague statement introduced as part of a hypnotic induction and paci ng and leading has multiple functions in facilitati ng hypnosis – it makes the subject a participant in th e hypnotic process, it makes the subject select bet ween alternative meanings thereby ensuring a satisfactor y pacing, and depending on the nature of the vaguen ess, it employs his linguistic (or cognitive) processes with a trans-derivational search for meaning in the vague statement. 77 “The unconscious mind responds to openings, opportu nities, metaphors, symbols and contradictions. Effective hypnotic suggestion, then, should be \"art fully vague\", leaving space for the subject to fill in the gaps with their own unconscious understandin gs - even if they do not consciously grasp what is happening. The skilled hypnotherapist constructs these gaps of meaning in a way most suited to the individual subject - in a way which is most lik ely to produce the desired change .” 78 The fact that Obama uses vague statements with whic h nobody can disagree is not just politics, it is p art of the linguistic component piece of the puzzle of Oba ma’s knowing and intentional use of Ericksonian hypnosis techniques. When Obama says “change” is can mean a lot of diffe rent things to everyone. He is not specific in wha t he means because then he would lose his pacing of the audience. Obama creates a trans-derivational searc h just by saying the vague word change, allowing that message of change to slip into the subconscious, a s a command, that he has associated with himself in a n umber of subconscious and conscious ways. People d o not rationally desire a change they do not have any idea of what it means. Some of the people want ch ange in this election but cannot explain what Obama will actually do and can’t name anything Obama has changed in his 46 years are supporting him because his implantation of this hypnotic suggestion of “ch ange” has been effective. partly why he is so frustrated about McCain saying that he, the maverick is the t rue change candidate, is because Obama spent all this t ime programming change, and doesn’t want McCain getting votes from Obama’s hypnotic programming. Use of visual imagery and imagination as an inducti on tool Visual imagery, like Obama’s, is a key component of facilitating hypnotic trance induction. 79 Using metaphor in hypnosis is especially effective becaus e it engages the conscious and unconscious mind at the same time, communicating logically while activating imagination and emotion allows the use of “ultra- compelling communications.” 80 Imagination is a powerful hypnotic tool because c reativity is an altered state of consciousness. 81   77 Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H.

Per the Power of Conversational Hypnosis, the four steps to hypnosis are also identical to the princip les of Obama’s speech. 1. absorb attention. 2. bypass the critical factor (with pacing) 3. create an u nconscious response (the classic one is emotion) and 4. le ad the subconscious mind to the desired outcome. 83 An emotional response is an unconscious response. 84 Raising of emotion is a fundamental technique in hypnosis to make the subject more programmable, mor e effectively, because emotion is a subconscious reaction, and can be connected to other subconsciou s elements, including commands. 85 Obama uses a visually, cognitively, and emotionally stimulating language that forces your mind to foll ow slowly by experiencing his phrases, instead of just listening to them. The pauses never get boring li ke other people who speak slowly, because each phrase by Oba ma that is only a few words long, is by itself sufficient to capture your attention, and hold it w ith thought, or imagination, or an image, until the next phrase is spoken. Visual and sensory imagery in th e hypnotist’s speech is an effective element that u ses the subject’s own imagination while listening to the sp eech to bring them deeper into trance. 86 Together, every hypnotic element is present in Oba ma’s speeches, all working together to hypnotize th e audience. You will notice Obama has all of these i n his speeches, unnaturally slow language in simpli stic phrases which catch and hold your attention, and co untless images that grab and hold your imagination, such as “turn the page”, and “a breeze is blowing a cross this nation,...and change is in the air.” and “write the next chapter in American history 87 .” “There’s a new breeze blowing across this natio n...” 88 The phrase is a visual and hypnotically captivating statement that you cannot disagree with because it makes your subconscious associate relaxation, pleasure, and ot her emotions and your most tranquil moment with his voice, preparing you for his following sentence, “a nd change is in the air.” The stacking of hypnotic language patterns in 40+ m inute long speeches The more a hypnotist paces and leads you, and uses other hypnotic speech patterns in succession, the m ore effective they become at manipulating you because t he repetition wears down your critical factor.

Have you ever wondered why Obama gives these long 40-50 minute sp eeches? Probably not, because most people do not even realize time has gone by. This process of pac ing then leading, pacing then leading, again and ag ain, as well as using other hypnotic language patterns is c alled “stacking language patterns” (as in, one on t op of the other) 89 The hypnotist blends the process with embedded co mmands, anchors, emotional transfers, and other techniques. What occurs is that the critical factor is bored, worn down, gets tired, and stops being critical because it is too much work – then, the hy pnotist’s effects increase. 90 \u0001 Obama’s unusual use of hand gestures as subconsciou s programming and hypnotic anchoring designed to be triggered in the voting booth on Nov ember 4th While most people believe that Obama’s hand gesture s as he speaks are meaningless, or innocent emphasi s to enhance the presentation, this may be sometimes perhaps to reserve the argument that they are meaningless, but is not always the case. Sometimes Obama does use his hand gestures simply for emphas is or to help illustrate what he is saying. However, s ometimes, his hand gestures are designed to have ve ry specific effect under the principles of hypnosis. Obama uses certain hand gestures as hypnotic anchor s, and others to aid in hypnotic command implantation. Anchoring is a hypnosis/NLP 91 technique where the hypnotist programs the subject to respond a certain way from a specific trigger or stimuli. A \"hypnotic an chor\" is any stimulus that triggers a consistent psychological state. 92 An anchor is essentially an internal state that i s triggered by an external stimulus. 93 An example would be, a hypnotist eliciting a certai n response from the subject, whether outward or inw ard, e.g. emotional, and then the hypnotist doing a cert ain act (the anchor) which is a touch, or a keyword , or signal, that the hypnotist associates subconsciousl y to the response. The hypnotist can then bring ab out that response just by repeating the anchor. It is simil ar to how Pavlov would ring a bell whenever he fed his dogs, and then eventually, his dogs would salivate just from the sound of hearing a bell ring. The hy pnotist stirs up feelings or emotions. “When that feeling is at its strongest, “anchor” is by making a gestur e. 94 Anchors do not have to be created or triggered by a physical touch, and could be any symbol or gesture that is a unique association. What is the different between innocent use of hand gestures by Obama and deceptive hypnotic use of han d gestures? Obviously, it is Obama’s knowledge of su ch hypnotic and manipulative effects of certain han d gestures, and his intended use of such hand gesture s for hypnotic effect.   89 Killer Influence Secrets of Covert Hypnosis, by Da vid X, Part 1 90 Killer Influence Secrets of Covert Hypnosis, by Da vid X, Part 1-6 91 Neuro-Linguistic Programming – a way of programmin g the subconscious mind through language 92 ‘Anchors occur throughout all of our sensory chann els in a potentially infinite number of ways.

Because a gesture is subconsciously linked by programming to a response, it must be uni que. 95 Obama uses this thumb and forefinger hand position essentially uniquely, differently than all other speakers, and continually, far more frequent ly than other speakers who use any similar hand gesture. I t was even made fun of on Saturday Night Live. So besides the fact that he has a somewhat unique h and gesture, which he uses more often than other speakers, what is the proof that this is part of Ob ama’s unethical use of hypnosis? Obama uses his thumb and forefinger pressed togethe r as a hidden (deep structure) hypnotic anchor. He also uses it to deliver hypnotic commands. The evidence it is not an innocent hand gesture e.g . for emphasis, but rather as a hypnotic anchor is that Obama is repeatedly caught using it extraordinarily often and specifically for very specific words and concepts like “believe”, and “chose.” In fact, oft en he is caught using certain it for such hypnotic programming words more so than at the point of his sentence that he would be emphasizing. Specific examples are plentiful below. Obama also uses hand gestures to aid in delivery of hypnotic commands, and this is evident from his us e of very specific hand gestures at very specific times. What is meant by the above two examples, is that wh ile Obama’s hand gestures often are simply for emphasis or to assist visually with his narrative, they are caught repeatedly diverging from this purp ose, and following entirely different principles, the princi ples of hypnotic anchoring and programming. The hand gesture can symbolize anything, and it is possible that Obama’s hand gesture of his thumb and forefinger pressed together symbolizes a “C” for ch ange, money, an infinite (hypnotic) connection betw een himself and the audience (by pointing with his inde x finger to the audience repeatedly and then emphas izing a point with his two fingers together, and others. Most likely, because it is a hypnotic trigger, Obam a’s thumb and forefinger hand gesture, as shown bel ow, is meant to hypnotically anchor and be triggered by the voter’s own hand holding a pencil, at the voti ng booth, or when signing in to vote. This way, the v oter would trigger all of the hypnotic programming right when Obama wants it triggered, while voting, for ma ximum effect. It is actually a very convenient des ign to have an anchor that looks like almost like an or dinary speech hand gesture, and also looks like the holding of a pen. Obama rarely needs to twist his hand to show you the backside. The image can be an effective anchor and trigger even if not understood consciously. Obama uses his thumb and forefinger hypnotic anchor in strategic ways. He does this repeatedly and of ten, programming (anchoring) many messages into your sub conscious. The hypnotic anchor that Obama is programming you with continually in his speeches is designed so that when you are in the voting booth holding a pen, or sign in your name, and see the sa me image Obama has been flashing at you throughout his campaign, you recall all of the messages he deliver ed during his speeches as he flashed the hand signa l that consciously you didn’t even realize were connected. His subconscious messages may influence your vote because you will be re-enacting what he has been pr eparing you for by loading that image of you holdin g the pen with his subconscious commands. Even peopl e who did not intend to vote for Obama may do so at   95 There are four keys to anchoring: The intensity of the state; Timing (peak of experience); Uniqueness of the stimulus, including the number of senses used (visual, auditory, kinest hetic, olfactory, gustatory), and; Exact replicatio n of the stimulus, or trigger..” http://www.hypnos.co.uk/hypnomag/valente.htm"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 27 that moment. It is also effective because a primar y message is Obama himself, and Obama has to a cert ain degree, anchored himself to the image of your hand as you hold a pen. Obama is also caught loading this hand gesture with very specific concepts, such as JFK, and then poin ting this same hand gesture inward towards himself a mom ent later, in ways that are clearly no accident, an d ways in which he does at no other time other than w ith a concept he expects us to subconsciously assoc iate with him. \u0001 \u0000\u0001 \u0001 \u0000\u0002 \u0001\u0001 Obama has also anchored and programmed you verbally with imagery for another part of this same experience in the voting booth through his clever u se of the words “turn the page.” His “turn the pag e speech” hypnotically anchors messages to the idea o f literally turning the page, which you do not real ize consciously, but subconsciously means, e.g., the vo ting ballot “page.” Thus, holding the pen and hold ing the paper ballot are anchored your subconscious for an experiences that will be recreated when it is t ime to act he has programmed you to act with multiple subc onscious anchors triggered by the same experience i n the voting booth. 98 As far as voting machines where you push buttons, o r electronic voting, Obama’s other very common hand gesture is pointing and poking, including for examp le, pointing straight downward and saying “there is no destiny we cannot fulfill.” 99 Many speakers point occasionally, or on a very st rong point, but not continuously and strenuously like Obama points. Mo st have never wondered what he is actually pointing at, or whether there is any rhyme or reason to it, prob ably assuming it is simply part of his presentation . In fact, Obama’s hand gestures often do symbolize what he is talking about perfectly, so that when he doe s do something hypnotic with his hand gestures, the mess age is received as having meaning subconsciously th en also. Obama’s other primary hand gesture tool, pointing, also often has meaning. Pointing sends the subconscious of the subject the message that a pers on in authority over them is commanding a certain action; ordering you to act a certain way and is a textbook part of hypnotic programming when giving commands of actions the subject is required to take . 100 If Obama said, “I command you to vote for me”,   96 Photo http://weblogs.newsday.com/news/local/longisland/po litics/blog/2008/03/obamas_speech_what_did_it_mean. html 97 Photo http://www.zimbio.com/Race+Relations/articles/216/B arak+Obama+speech+race+thoughts+economy 98 In a blog questioning whether Barack Obama is the anti-christ, bloggers’ reports are described as “So me people have reported Obama appearing in dreams and even mysteriously con trolling their actions in the voting booth.” http://timmcnellie.blogspot.com/2008/08/enter-anti- christ.html 99 - which the subconscious mind interprets, because it often deletes negatives, as “we fulfill destiny. ” 100 The Power of Conversational Hypnosis, Clifford Mee and Igor Ledowchowski, p104 of 631"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 28 people would get this consciously and reject it. H owever, if he does it in a way that you only pick i t up subconsciously, you can’t question it, and can’t re ject it. See the analysis below of Obama’s Denver Democratic National Convention 2008 speech in which he uses this command as he is programming the audience to vote for him on “November 4 th .” *Obama’s hypnotic command that “a light will shine down from somewhere, it will light upon you, you will experience an epiphany, and you will say to yourself, ‘I have to vote for Barack’” 101 An example of Obama using both of these hypnotic ha nd gestures, hypnotic programming followed by hypnotic anchor back to back, in a way that can be nothing other than hypnosis In this speech by Obama, he is caught giving an ove rt set of two hypnotic programs back to back. This is probably one of the most simple to understand proof s of his undeniable use of hypnosis: Perfectly demonstrating both the hypnotic hand gest ures explained above is Obama in this sentence. Yes, that’s correct. Barack Obama actually said in a speech once: “a light will shine down from somewhere, it will li ght upon you, you will experience an epiphany, and you will say to yourself, “I have to vote for B arack”’ 102 It was even made fun of in a McCain ad entitled “Th e One”, probably without any realization that he wa s serious, and actually attempting to use hypnosis 103 In this statement, Obama went too far, too obviou sly, and was clearly overtly hypnotically programming hi s audience. Probably, he intended to use statement s like this more often, and probably stopped either b ecause he thought it was too obvious, or because he was ridiculed for this by Hillary and McCain, or both. First, notice how voting for Obama is made absolute ly compulsory with the words “have to” – precisely as a hypnotic command. He is not asking for our vote – he is telling us how we will vote. Notice the language “light shining down”, and “it w ill light upon you” a description of some supernatu ral (subconscious) force. This statement by Obama lea ves no doubt that he is using hypnosis – which a mysterious force shining down and causing you to sa y to yourself obviously is. It leaves no doubt tha t his mindset is on completely non-logical, but rather my stical/supernatural (subconscious) forces will be compelling people to vote for him. Why would a pol itician who logically convinces voters ever joke ab out something like this? What purpose would there poss ibly be for any politician ever saying that a myste rious force will guide you and you will “have to” vote fo r me? This is potentially his worst slip up.   101 Video of Obama saying this phrase in this McCain a d http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopkn0lPzM8 102 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mopkn0lPzM8 103 See the McCain ad entitled, “The One.” Available, e.g. at www.johnmccain.com Hillary Clinton has also criticized this statement."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 29 Notice the language, “you will experience an epipha ny” – a revelatory manifestation of a divine being. 104 While hypnosis text contains considerable informati on about hypnotists attaining g-d complexes, it is quite disturbing to see a presidential candidate, even in jest, suggest that he presence would cause such an “epiphany.” More disturbing, see below why it is p rovably not jest in which he makes this statement. Undeniable evidence that this is hypnosis: Obama hy pnotically anchoring the statement about a light sh ining down and an internal voice saying “I have to vote f or Barack” Obama, while saying this sentence uses both his poi nting gesture as a hypnotic command implantation, a nd his thumb and forefinger gesture as a hypnotic anch or, back to back. In fact, watch this video to see how Obama uses the se hypnotic hand gestures. Notice how Obama, as he says “you will say to yours elf” – points up into the air, as explained and ana lyzed, pointing is the hypnotic gesture for commanding som eone to do something, to perform a specific act. Then, notice how Obama clearly uses his typical thu mb and forefinger hypnotic anchor for the words “I have to vote for Barack.” By no cosmic miracle does this happen by coincidenc e. He is clearly using a back to back set of hypno tic hand gestures while giving this sentence containing overt hypnotic programming to be compelled by a mysterious internal voice, taken over by a mysterio us force, and to “have to” vote for him. It is clear he was not joking either. Because if h e were joking, he would not use any hand gesture as emphasis for the commands of a statement he was not serous about. Let alone two hand gestures. If he uses a hand gesture even for innocent emphasis, that mea ns he is seriously emphasizing the underlying state ment, “a light will shine down from somewhere, it will li ght upon you, you will experience an epiphany, and you will say to yourself, “I have to vote for Barack”’ While this is a caricature of what Obama is doing t hroughout his campaign, this statement cannot be vi ewed any other way than an obvious attempt at sending a hypnotic message to voters in the voting booth. Convincing without logic: “The Fierce! Urgency! of Now!” argument (Obama caught anchoring) While giving speeches, Obama often poses to himself the question: “Why are you running so soon? You can afford to wait.” 105 He then answers his own question by saying the po werful language “ because the Fierce! ... Urgency! of ... Now!” First, notice ho w he posed the question to himself, to give himself an opportunity to use the anchor. It doesn’t make muc h sense to pose a question to oneself that you then fail to logically answer. He then answers flashing just du ring those words his unique thumb in forefinger anchoring hand gesture. These words have preprogra mmed emotional meaning to all of us, which he with such techniques anchors you to recall as you hold t he pen and “turn the page 106 ” in the voting booth. 107   104 American heritage Dictionary – Fourth Edition 105 Example: Billings, Montana, 1:07pm EST 106 See below more detailed discussion of Obama’s prep rogrammed hypnotic response use of his famous phras e “turn the page” and"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 30 Watching such gestures in his speeches, they are cl early intentionally designed to coincide for a spec ific hypnotic purpose, not just innocent emphasis and en hancement. Notice how powerfully saying “the fierce urgency of now” provides absolutely no logical basis for why he should not accomplish at least something in the sen ate first, nor any logical argument as to why we sh ould elect an inexperienced person. It is effective bec ause he uses causation, by saying “ because the fierce urgency of now!” Again, he uses the most powerful causality linking statement “because” (with no logi cal value) followed by powerful words “fierce” and “urg ency” – both of which are not only powerful but hav e embedded meaning to each listener, and then he puts his emphasis on “now!” “Now” is not only a powerf ul word in hypnosis because it brings the subject’s fo cus and attention on the present, but, is a command that the voter take action “now.” Those in the marketin g field know that adding “now” to the end of any command, such as “buy this product” “now!” increase s sales by measured degrees. Obama caught in subconscious hand gesture linking M cCain to Bush Giving a speech about healthcare in Raleigh North C arolina, right as Obama mentions Bush and McCain, h e slips a barely noticeable double handed gesture wit h two fingers (the same of each hand) pointing para llel, to suggest to you subconsciously that Bush and McCa in are on parallel courses. 108 A primary value of this little gesture is critical because it is a slip up, it is obvious. If there is any doubt that Obama i s using hypnosis including hidden hand signals, watching th is tape clearly shows him flashing a parallel signa l which cannot be an accident, right when he mentions Bush and McCain. From the ethical perspective, Obama could make policy arguments and try to convin ce you logically that he feels McCain will follow similar policies to Bush. However, Obama apparentl y feels that he needs to do more to convince you. What Obama decides to do, is to implant a subconscious i mage of parallel, which you subconsciously associat e with Bush and McCain, that in many people is the de ep psyche source of associating their policies. Wh ether true or not, Obama through this subconscious progra mming, decided voters should not even be able logically analyze or debate the issue, but should s imply have the image of parallel implanted without their conscious awareness to look at Bush and McCain as p arallel. Obama caught using one-finger subconscious hand ges ture regarding Hillary 109        107 Speech by Barack Obama in Billings, Montana, “the fierce urgency of now”, around 1:07pm EST “why are you running so soon, can afford to wait, ruining now “because of t he fierce urgency of now” and he flashes the thumb and forefinger together exactly for that sentence in a way that cannot be a ccidental. 108 Barack Obama in speech, Raleigh North Carolina Jun e 9, 2008 ~1:40m EST 109 http://weblogs.newsday.com/news/local/longisland/po litics/blog/givefinger.jpg"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 31 Obama was caught doing this. While pretending to b e innocently scratching, he was caught giving this subconscious signal regarding Hillary, with his mid dle finger. 110 This alone might be excused as an accident, but in combination with everything else, is clearly another piece of the puzzle. Like the “ light shining down” statement discussed later, like his l ogo, like the “lipstick on a pig”, and all of his o ther slip- ups, it also gives you some insight into Obama’s tr ue character. Further proving that this Hillary ge sture was not an accident, see Obama’s similar gesture re garding McCain discussed directly below. Obama caught in another undeniable subconscious han d gesture regarding McCain Even after Obama’s Hillary gesture above was caught by the media, he didn’t stop. On Wednesday September 17, 2008 at around 2:56pm EST in a televi sed speech in Nevada, Obama made some remarks about terrorism, then the economy. Shortly after O bama began to discuss John McCain, with his right h and he apparently reached up to scratch the top of his head, then again scratch the top side of his head. As Obama pulled his hand away, he clearly flashed the “L” symbol with his hand (thumb and finger perpendicular), which to many young people, is the symbol for “loser.” He did it as he was mocking ho w bad John McCain was on the economy. This was no ac cident. It is unusual for someone like Obama with such perfect body language to have to scratch in th e middle of a speech anyway. (without doing a hand gesture which insults his opponent) It is even mor e unusual for someone to have to scratch in two dif ferent places as he did. When watching this video, it is clear that he was pretending to scratch as an inten tional diversion to slip in the subconscious message. He even appeared to hesitate to be sure to “pull it of f” inconspicuously. It was intended to be a subconsci ous message to millions of people, to associate the “loser” symbol with John McCain. This act was desi gned to take away votes from John McCain not with any logical explanation of policy differences, but with messages to an unaware audience - messages to our subconscious that we are not intended to question t he correctness of. To those who think this may have been accidental or coincidence, watch the video of Obama on 8.4.2008, where Obama gives a speech discussing John McCain’s economics. When Obama says “McCain” in the sentence “Senator McCain has been eager to share so me of his plans” – notice Obama again flashes the “ L” symbol with his hand.

Obama’s California Democratic Convention speech 200 7 111 - a “play by play” of his undeniable use of embedded commands, hypnotic induc tion, and hypnotic storytelling Embedded suggestions are messages within other mess ages, in which while the conscious mind is receivin g one message (the surface structure), the subconscio us is receiving another, the real message. This can be done a number of ways, including by change in tone, or pauses, even ones so subtle the audience is not consciously aware of it, such as a split second pau se or breath by the hypnotist at a specific time. 112 Pauses during speech and changes in tonality and in emphasis are a primary technique of conversational hypnosis. 113 This is because you can say one sentence, and bur ied within it is another word or phrase with another meaning. A pause in speaking by the hypnot ist, even is only for a split second, even if you a re not even consciously aware of it, can turn that hidden meaning into a subconscious command because it is isolated, and emphasized in the subconscious. The subconscious mind does not interpret and analyze as the conscious mind does, and often many words are remov ed “deleted” from what you experience, and only specific portions fall through to the subconscious mind. \u0001 His statement is heard by the audience in one way, but subconsciously received another way, the way ac tually intended by Obama. Obama performs an undeniable Ericksonian hypnotic i nduction: Obama’s “Turn the Page” Speech at the California Democratic Convention in 2007. 114 Note: While there are many examples and play by pla ys which are undeniable evidence of Obama’s hypnosis. carefully reviewing and understanding ju st this analysis of this part of this speech leaves little doubt of Obama’s intentional use of hypnosis. One journalist describes Obama’s turn the page spee ch as having “had the California Democratic Convention spellbound for 23 minutes.” 115 Seeing the analysis below of just the first parag raph of this speech explains why his audience was in a spell fro m the very beginning. Obama began his speech: (notes added) “It has now been a little over two months (pause) s ince we began (pause) this campaign for the Presidency. (pause) In that time we have traveled all across this country. (pause) And before every event we do (pause), I usually have a minute to sit quietly and (pause) collect my thoughts. (pause) And recently, I’ve found myself (pause) reflecting on (pause) what it was that led me (different tone, and thumb and forefinger anchor for “me”) to public service in the first place.”   111 Barack Obama’s speech to California Democratic Con vention, 2007, available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZUXhCW-OGM 112 See a thorough discussion of embedded commands sta rting page 172 of Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniqu es of Milton H.

Russo Barack Obama’s “Turn the Page” Speech Wows Califor nia Democratic Convention, http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/2007/04/bar ack_obamas_t_2.html"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 33 First, notice how much Obama uses storytelling in h is major speeches, especially at the beginning of n early all of his speeches. Storytelling is a primary hyp notic tool because it employs images, metaphor, the imagination, rhythm, makes us feel like children, a nd takes us to another time and place so the mind t ells itself “it is only a story” and allows it to pass i nto the subconscious. 116 However, this is just the beginning. Obama tells a hypnotic story to start this speech w ith his ultra-slow speaking style with huge pauses after 4- 8 word concepts, to force you to hang on his every word. But this is only a small part of the proof that he is intentionally using hypnosis. The key is, that the story he is telling is a story about a “trance theme.” In one of the most popula r conversational hypnosis courses available online, t he Power of Conversational Hypnosis, the first prin ciple taught in how to use hypnotic stories, is exactly w hat Obama does in this paragraph. This primary tec hnique is to “Use Simple Stories About Trance Themes”, or in other words, tell stories about processes which are hypnotic, such as per the examples given, relaxing on a holiday or being fascinated by a film. 117 Obama follows precisely this technique in telling a simple story in slow hypnotic rhythm about himself “sitting quietly”, “collect his thoughts”, and find ing himself “reflecting.” Hypnotic stories use emb edded suggestions so that while in trance and you believe something is happening to a character in the story , in reality the story is about you, implanting messages in your subconscious. 118 The story requires you to use your imagination, and then the only way to understa nd the story is to imagine the themes Obama is presenting. 119 Obama’s first storytelling language pattern about a trance theme is “Sit quietly” – also a pacing stat ement because everyone in the audience is sitting quietly . The story is, as taught by this course, “isomorp hic” in the sense that the story precisely mirrors what is happening with the subject e.g. sitting quietly. 120 Then, it is also an embedded command, because when someone s its quietly, something they have rehearsed many times throughout their lives, because external stim uli are absent, sitting quietly makes someone’s tho ughts turn inward or internally – as in trance. Notice h ow the story is in past tense, but the trance theme (command) comes out in present tense. Notice how Obama puts the focus on this word “quiet ly” with the pause afterward, to use it as a hypnot ic message, as the silence emphasizes the last word sp oken. His pause after “sit quietly” also serves an other purpose. (Even though he says “and” after “quietly ”, there is a substantial pause there.) It is also a pace in the manner that Obama says the word “quietly ...and ”, and for a brief second there is silence afterwar d. He is in fact making his statement about quietness an absolute immediately verifiable truth, because he m akes it true by pausing, and finds a way to pace you in yet another way. The more different ways he can pace the audience on different levels, the more effective it is. Obama’s second storytelling language pattern about a trance theme is “collect my thoughts.” Though   116 The Power of Conversational Hypnosis, Clifford Mee and Igor Ledochowski, “How to Destroy Resistance W ith Stories” p244 – discussion of how “it’s just a story” and mind go es on “automatic pilot.” 117 The Power of Conversational Hypnosis, Clifford Mee and Igor Ledochowski, “How to Destroy Resistance W ith Stories” p245 118 The Power of Conversational Hypnosis, Clifford Mee and Igor Ledochowski, “How to Destroy Resistance W ith Stories” p245- 246, and see discussion how Dr. Erickson used a sto ry about a tomato plant feeling good to in fact mak e the patient feel good. 119 Your subconscious interprets the story and applies it to you, even though Obama tells the story as if it were him speaking innocently about himself. As a basic hypnosis exam ple, I can say “don’t think of a black cat” – in or der to understand the message, you have to think of the cat – it doesn’t matter that I say “don’t.” 120 The Power of Conversational Hypnosis, Clifford Mee and Igor Ledochowski, “How to Destroy Resistance W ith Stories” p246"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 34 Obama says it from his perspective, to make sense o f it, and because of his pacing, your subconscious also hears it as collect “my” thoughts, and thus the min ds of everyone in the audience is commanded to beco me more in depth into each’s own thoughts, and go deep er into trance. Notice again this story about past actions is again delivered in present tense. Obama’s third storytelling language pattern about a trance theme is “I’ve found myself reflecting.” I t works similarly. The pause after “myself”, and then agai n after “reflecting” cause the audience’s subconsci ous mind to pick up on these commands. Thus Obama uses this as a command for all listeners to collect the ir thoughts (as in hypnotic focus) 121 and be reflecting (essentially focus on another deeper level). Noti ce again how he starts out telling the story in the past ten se, but then says “reflecting” in the present progr essive tense to be a command for his audience to do what they ar e doing now. The course on conversational hypnosis is not the on ly source to say such language has specific trance induction effect. See also Dr. Erickson’s discussi on of use of words like “reflecting”, and how a hyp notist will construct sentences using the internal states consistent with a human being undergoing trance ind uction (e.g. wondering, learning, thinking, feeling, remem bering, recalling, experiencing). 122 Obama then directs this focus. Obama says “reflect ing on (what it was that led) me ” While the sentence continues, the hypnotic message is for the audience to “be reflecting on me” (Obama). Obama’s emphasi s and use of a different tonality for the word “me” i s undeniable – it can clearly be heard when one is listening for it. When not consciously focused on that empha sis, it is just heard by the subconscious. After b eing paced by three separate stories with trance themes, delivered in hypnotic slow speech, the subconsciou s mind is waiting for clues about what to be so focus ed on and reflecting on, and surely enough, Obama t ells our subconscious minds, “me.” Because he is speaki ng, the message is actually to focus not only on hi m, but his voice. Then, perfectly timed, at the same moment Obama say s the word “me”, he flashes his thumb and forefinge r hand gesture, his classic anchoring tool. Watching this tape – it is amazing, yet undeniable. Obama is not just using a subliminal message. He is knowingly and intentionally performing a clinical E ricksonian hypnotic induction and putting his audie nce trance. Obama has hidden undetectably in normal-sounding sp eech what a hypnotist would do to start an inductio n by saying “sit quietly, begin to internalize your t houghts, collect your thoughts, reflect, and focus on the me and the sound of my voice.” 123 He is talking to your subconscious mind, preparin g it for deeper induction and programming, while you think he is just telling you stories. Then, for the rest of the speech, yo ur subconscious mind will be receptive to messages on this level that you wont even be aware of. Look at how cleverly Obama disguises this induction as him simply telling you a story about himself si tting quietly and reflecting. Logically, there is no rea son why Obama would be talking about himself sittin g quietly and reflecting. Yet, you would never notic e this unless you understood the science behind it.

Let alone a story allegedly about past exper iences that somehow ends up with each trance theme being delivered in the present tense. There is no logical reason why he would have pauses after the c oncepts “sit quietly”, “collect my thoughts”, and “reflecti ng on” because those aren’t (supposedly) the ends o f the idea nor the sentence. Unless, that is exactly wha t he wants! There is no logical reason why he woul d place an unnatural emphasis on the word “me” – nor reason to use any hand gesture precisely for this word. What else watching this tape a few times also shows, is that Obama is a pro. He performs this so smoothly and comfortably, that he is clearly well rehearsed, and an expert. Obama caught intentionally controlling pace in obvi ous attempt to maintain trance As additional evidence that Obama purposely places and keeps his audience in trance, he is here caught controlling the tempo of his speech to make sure ev eryone is kept in trance. He says at 5:30 124 “Why would you want to go into something dirty and nasty like politics?” Then, he realizes he is speaking too fa st, and he may not be properly leading everyone in the tran ce he is inducing, so to ensure he has everyone in trance, he repeats the sentence, slower, much slower, and w ith an extra extra long pause before “politics.” T he second time he says, “Why would you want to go into ...(huge pause to slow down the audience mentally and slow them down to his unnaturally slow rhythm) ...politics.” He does this to make sure he does n ot speak so quickly as to lose the trance he is puttin g his audience into. This act, obvious on video, c larifies the difference between a person who just happens to be a good speaker who may have some innocent tranc e effect on some, and someone who knowingly and inten tionally makes sure he has everyone in trance as he speaks. Watching this video, it is clear Obama kno ws exactly what he is doing. While there is too much to analyze every hypnotic a spect of such complex speeches, this speech is a ro ller coaster ride of raising emotion, slow accelerating to fast, moderate volume leading to loud, and at ea ch peak of the emotional highs he creates, he anchors the e motion he has raised to his “turn the page” languag e pattern. Occasionally an interesting concept can be caught, for instance this tidbit: At one point when Obama talks about “parting of the sea”, his corresponding hand gesture is not one of the sea parting with his palm s turning upward, but of pushing apart downward the w ater palms down, as if he were himself g-d parting the water. Perhaps accidental, or perhaps an intention al small part of some larger themes and concepts discussed below, connected to the reason why people like Nancy Pelosi make some strange comments, e.g. referring to Obama as “sent by g-d”, and other peop le refer to Obama as the Messiah. The frightening part is, if Obama is doing this intentionally, he either wants to send the subconscious message that he is the messiah, or he actually believes that he is. More on this later. Obama’s speech Tuesday after primaries ended June 3 , 2008 125 – undeniable evidence of   124 5 minutes and 30 seconds into the start of the spe ech per the video used for analysis. 125 Remarks of Senator Barack Obama: Final Primary Nig ht, Date: 06/03/2008, Location: St. Paul, MN, video available at http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=obama+speech+ St.+Paul+&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&rls=org.mozilla:en- US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&sa=N&tab=wv&oi=pr operty_suggestions&resnum=0&ct=property-revision&cd =2#"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 36 Obama’s use of hypnotic principles of anchoring, de letion, distraction, and leading Obama, also began his speech on the Tuesday night a fter Primaries were over with an undeniable hypnoti c induction, using the paragraph below. First he said, in his ultra-slow speech with huge s trategic pauses, “after fifty four (pause) hard fou ght contests (pause) our primary season has finally com e to an end.” – A pace for which he got tremendous applause. Then, Obama continued: “Sixteen months have passed (pause) since we first stood together on the steps of the Old State Capitol (pause) in Springfield, Illinois.(pause) T housands (pause) of miles have been traveled. (paused) Millions of voices have been heard. (pause ) And because of what you said (pause) because you decided that change must come to Washington (pa use); because you believed (pause) that this year must be different than all the rest (pause); b ecause you chose (pause) to listen not to your doubts or your fears (pause) but to your greatest h opes and highest aspirations (pause), tonight we mark the end of(pause) one historic journey (pause ) with the beginning of another (pause) – a journey (pause) that will bring a new and better da y to America. (pause) Because of you (pause) tonight, I can stand here and say that I will be (p ause) the Democratic nominee (pause) for President of the United States of America.” The analysis below explains what Obama is really do ing, and what message your subconscious mind is actually receiving and why. First, again the unnaturally slow speech as discuss ed, which forces you to hang on his every word, cre ating focus. Notice how his pauses are designed to have you reflect and ponder, and have your mind wander during each pause. As your mind wanders, his words echo in the subconscious mind while your conscious mind is left hanging. This technique is designed t o strain your critical factor’s efforts until it ge ts tired, and begins to tune out, leaving your subconscious mind in his hands, unprotected. While he starts out ultra-slow, his plan is to guid e you by slowly accelerating his speech to the poin t where he increases volume, raises emotion, and delivers t he lead. This is almost like how a horseracing ann ouncer starts out speaking slow when the horses take off f rom the staring gate, and by the final stretch he i s yelling and speaking very rapidly. Just like how a horsera ce announces builds excitement in his audience to promote the emotion-charged intensity and betting. It is not accidental. It is done and learned and rehearsed to manipulate us. He brings the listeners into tra nce with this process. Subconsciously, the raising of rate of speech, volume, and emotion send the message that a ll of the before is building up to his grand finale of the paragraph, the lead, e.g. that he will be President . However, while a horseracing announcer does it o nce per race, Obama in his speeches repeats this roller coa ster again and again while combining it with comple x hypnotic pacing and leading, anchoring, and other m anipulative subconscious techniques. The repetitiveness is also hypnotic. 126 This is all part of the hypnotic trance induction . Again, like all of Obama’s major speeches, he start s off from the beginning using hypnotic storytellin g.

It is not only magically captivating, b ut as discussed, is a textbook hypnosis induction. 127 It makes your conscious mind imagine things and drift off to another time and place using imagination – a n altered state of consciousness and fundamental tool of hypnosis. 128 Listening to this, you have no option but to strain your conscious mind trying to figure out what comes next, while using your imagination to fo llow along through his images and stories. This helps b ring the usually protected subconscious mind to the forefront, making it vulnerable. He not only forces you to focus, and asks you to us e imagination, but he has you count numbers, e.g., “ sixteen months”, “ thousands of miles”, “ millions of voices heard.” Firstly, “one of the techniques employed by hypnotists in inducing or deepening a t rance state in a client is that of having the clien t count.” 129 Now here is where it gets really interesting. Obam a uses the following key hypnosis technique, now hi s fourth separate and distinct fundamental hypnosis t echnique in just his first paragraph. He applies a dominant hemisphere distraction technique precisely as taught by Erickson’s three dimensions of hypnosis. 130 Distraction is a common and fundamental technique in hypnosis in which the dominant hemisphere is distracted by the language its job is to process. The dominant hemisphere is sent on an assignment using the linguistic processes and imagi nation. The critical factor is thus occupied, to m ake the non-dominant hemisphere and subconscious more susce ptible to suggestion. 131 Here is how it works. He asks you to imagine sixte en months, so you do. You follow where the storyte ller takes your mind and so you try to imagine thousands of miles, and continue following along where he le ads you. However, the conscious mind cannot imagine a million voices, the number is too big 132 , though Obama tricks you with the first two numbers into tr ying, by leading you down a path of increasingly difficult concepts to imagine consciously . Notice how cleverly he leads you down a path whi ch causes the dominant hemisphere to be distracted, and tune out of trying to do exactly what he is asking you to do . Your mind tries to imagine a million and is distrac ted, sent off on an assignment it can’t perform, tu ning out, and exposing your subconscious mind. This is a cal culated and pre-scripted hypnotic induction techniq ue, and the only specific and logical explanation that makes any sense for what he is saying. Does this s eem a bit too unlikely to be coincidence? What other pur pose for this could there be for this language to b e delivered exactly this way? What is he even talkin g about?   127 There are four chapters on Hypnotic Storytelling i n Conversational Hypnosis, The Power of Conversatio nal Hypnosis, Clifford Mee and Igor Ledochowski, “How to Destroy Resistanc e With Stories” as well as a cheat sheet on using h ypnotic storytelling to break resistance. 128 Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. E rickson, M.D. Volume 1, p60, Inquiry with Aldous Hu xley 129 Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. E rickson, M.D. Volume 1, p187 130 Erickson’s three dimensions are: Pacing and distr action of the dominant (language) hemisphere; 2. U tilization of the dominant hemisphere, language processing which occu rs below the level of awareness; 3. Accessing of t he non-dominant hemisphere; 131 Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. E rickson, M.D. Volume 1, p13 – “[Erickson’s] overall strategy while conducting trance inductions appears to have these three dimensions. 1) pacing and distraction of the dominant (language) hemisphere; 2) Utilization of the dominant hemisphe re, language processing which occurs below the leve l of awareness; and 3) Accessing of the non-dominant hemisphere.” See als o, p137, “The induction of the altered state of con sciousness called trance requires and implies the distraction and/or utiliza tion of what Milton calls the conscious mind.” 132 One cannot imagine all the grains of sand on a bea ch individually. you can imagine a lot of them, or the beach, but the conscious mind cannot process numbers of that size."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 38 Then, right after the distraction, notice the causa lity linking statements, FIVE of them, back to back , “ because of what you said... because you decided change must come to Washington... because you believed that this year must be different... because you chose to listen to your doubts not your fears. .. because of you” - all pacing and leading techniques with the c ausation already embedded, with the paragraph endin g with the words “President of the United States” as the effect brought about by all those “ becauses, ” thereby becoming subconsciously linked. The most powerful linking statement “because” according to Dr. Ericks on and every covert hypnotist cited in this document, is used not once, but five times , connecting Obama’s concepts to the lead, not that he is the democratic nominee, but “President of the United States,” the only words of that sentence he can be seen using pointin g down hand gestures for. This is something nobody would never notice without an understanding of paci ng, leading, and causality linking statements, but now that it is pointed out it certainly seems more than odd that he is using the word “because” so obtrusi vely. Why would anyone set up sentence structure for any concept this way? (Because A, because B, because C , because D, because E,...therefore X) Concepts are never set up to be communicated this way. It is to o difficult to follow and impractical, and there is n o purpose for it. Not unless one had a very specif ic purpose for using the word “because.” Now let’s look at his use of hypnotic programming w ords: “decided”, “believed”, and “chose.” (other hypnotic programming words include “realize”, “know ”, “understand”, and so on.) These are hypnotic programming words because instead of convincing you rationally until you actually decide, or believe, or choose, the hypnotist simply puts you in trance, di stracts your dominant hemisphere, and implants the command into your subconscious. He hypnotizes you and simply tells you that you chose, that you belie ve, that you decided. Implantation of this word is mor e powerful than hours and hours of convincing you rationally. It is neither simply presumptuous nor coincidence that he is telling you what you decide d, believed, and chose. So these words stand out in y our mind, he places the most minute emphasis on “decided”, then a much larger emphasis on and pause after “believed”, and then a huge emphasis on and pause after “chose.” Some of these concepts are in the past tense, and that is also effective, someti mes even more so, because telling us prior our mind states m ay make them even deeper. Obama uses “because” before each of these programmi ng words because you must accept the premise in order to be able to follow the concept to the end a nd understand it. That’s why starting with five se parate “because”s leading to one later “therefore” does no t other than hypnotically make good communication structure. Because normally it tries to get you to accept precursor concepts before you even know wha t they are connected to - before you even know what the al leged actual concept being communicated is. Now let’s look at the pacing used in this same para graph. “Tonight Minnesota” is a pace, because it i s tonight, and he is in Minnesota. “Primary season h as finally come to an end” is a pace because it is obviously true. Standing together and voices heard may help pace the audience because that is what th ey are doing literally, standing there and hearing the voices of the crowd. “You decided change must com e to Washington” is a pace, because it is something we a ll know is needed – almost nobody can disagree with that. However, when you accept that, the hidden me aning to accept is that Obama should be President. “This year must be different than all the rest” is a pace, because literally every year is different. When you accept that, you also accept his hidden meaning, th at this year will be different because Obama will b ecome President. “I can stand here and say” is again a l iteral pace because he is standing there and saying something. Also notice how, because of the five “because”s, he not only connects these concepts to the lead, but connects these concepts to each other. Starting wi th a literal pace, he connects standing there heari ng voices, to wanting change to come, to this year bei ng different, which he connects subconsciously to your greatest hopes and highest aspirations, to back aga in to another literal pace, the fact that he is sta nding there"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 39 saying something. He doesn’t even need to know wha t your greatest hopes and highest aspirations are, and he doesn’t even need to care. He has linked your g reatest hopes and highest aspirations, no matter wh at they are, as sure as he is standing there speaking, to him being the President of the United States. That’s how hypnosis works. it doesn’t get you to believe, it tricks your subconscious mind into accepting th e word “believe.” Now let’s look at his perfectly timed hand gestures for the same paragraph. His hand gestures with hi s right hand give essentially the same thumb and forefinger hand gesture starting precisely at the words “beli eve (that this year should be different than all the re st)”, and “chose.” He does not, however, do this h and gesture, if it is truly for innocent emphasis, for what you normally think he would, the alleged messa ge, e.g. “change must come to Washington”, not for “greatest hopes and highest aspirations”, nor for “a new and better day for America”, nor does he do that gestur e for “I will be the democratic nominee.” While he uses this hand gesture at some other parts, from the beg inning, he doesn’t use them at all until, and then primarily for “believe”, and “chose.” Then, as he says “demo cratic nominee” his hands appear motionless form th is video, and he emphasizes and points downward for th e word “President.” Now we look at “deep structure” – how the audiences ’ subconscious minds might interpret the same paragraph as delivered by Obama. 133 Under the fundamental hypnotic principles of “del etion”, “distortion”, and “generalization”, the mind alters the content i t receives as it goes into the subconscious. – A translation which is used and planned for by hypnotists. 134 While your critical factor is distracted and capt ivated deeply by Obama’s trance, the same paragraph, to your subc onscious, may be received something like this: [thi s is one possible translation with partial analysis adde d] “ we stand together ... my voice is being heard ...because you said...because you decided that change must come...because you believed [anchor] this year must be different than all the rest...because you chose [anchor] to listen [trance theme in storytelling] your greatest hopes and highest aspirations ... we bring a new and better day ...Tonight I can stand here and say [pacing] I will be the Democratic nominee [no visible hand ges tures on the video] ‘the President of the United States’” [Pointing hand gestures downward (as if on a touch screen or push button voting) command gesture] Also notice yet another distraction technique – rhy me. He rhymes I will be with the democratic nomin ee – a distraction technique which again distracts the lin guistic processing part of the mind, as he points d ownward and says “President!” An apparently innocent yet powerful paragraph on th e surface structure, is actually intended to be rec eived as clear commands to feel as one with Obama and hea r his voice. He programs into you that you have already chosen, you have already decided, and you a lready believed. Before your conscious mind can sa y “wait, did I decide that?” he rewards you by conjur ing up your own feelings “greatest hopes and highes t aspirations.” Then, the “because”s come together f or the lead, with hand gestures, “President.” By reviewing Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. Erickson, M.D. Volume 1, as well as othe r works on Ericksonian hypnosis, one may see a more d etailed discussion of “deletion”, “generalization”, and   133 Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. E rickson, M.D. Volume 1, p165, discusses how a singl e surface structure communication can have not only different, but mult iple “deep structure” representations to the subcon scious mind. 134 A subconscious deletes parts of communication that it does not understand or are incomplete. For exa mple, “It seemed like an impossible task” – since it is unclear to whom it s eemed impossible, there is no way for the subconsci ous to comprehend the meaning of it, so all that the subconscious takes a way from this sentence is “task.”"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 40 “distortion.” 135 Now one might argue that half of this is coincidenc e, and the other half is just him being a great and powerful speaker. But let’s look at it. Why would he speak so slowly? We know he speaks faster in interviews and debates – why speak so slowly in spe eches? What about the acceleration of his rate of speech to the lead? Why such storytelling? Why th e exorbitant use of visualization and imagination? ...Which lead the audience down a path of imagining things until asking the imagining of something tha t can’t be consciously imagined? Why the five “becau se”s and why the unusual message structure from someone who speaks so well? Why the hyper- confide nce for specific words like “decided”, “chose”, and “believe” with pauses after each one when they are not supposed to be the end of neither the sentence nor the idea? Why the hyper-arrogance for “greatest ho pes and highest aspirations?” Why the repeated sta ting of the obvious and undeniable “I stand here tonight ?” (used in all his speeches) Why no hand gesture for “democratic nominee”- why only for “President? And finally, how come all of these “coincidences” can all be explained by a single reason – all under the pri nciples of hypnosis?...Which causes exactly the typ e of mesmerized effect everyone admits they have from hi m? Obama caught delivering another powerful hypnotic c ommand Not every hypnotic technique of Obama in this speec h is discussed herein – only a few examples are lis ted. Notice his anchor at 9:17 of the word (independents and republicans who) “understand.” Notice his extraordinarily long pauses after “chang e” 9:20 and 9:28. At 9:55, Obama slips in a powerful hypnotic command . A moment after he can clearly be seen anchoring it with a hand gesture. At 9:55, Obama says, “All of you chose (notice the different tone and vo lume and microsecond pause after chose) to support a candidate you believe in deeply . (pause) ” No, it is not simply presumptuous or arrogant to te ll his audience that they “believe in him” “ deeply .” Again, it is hypnotic programming. First, he uses “chose” to program our subconscious minds that our conscious minds have already analyze d and made a decision. Again, the same hypnotic prog ramming word he used in his opening paragraph discussed in the above example. If effective, this programming can even override our conscious knowle dge that we haven’t in fact chosen. We will simply bel ieve that we have chosen, and simply choose Obama. As he speaks the word “chose”, while your critical fac tor is analyzing whether in fact you chose any such thing   135 Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. E rickson, M.D. Volume 1, Starting p 7, discussion of how models of the world we create differ from reality, then, on p 20, “One of the most powerful of these linguistic mode ling techniques is deletion, the case in which a portion of the meaning of the s entence (the Deep Structure) has no representation in Surface Structure...” Under complex deletion principles, the audiences mi nds filter out certain aspects of the speech, and s uch speeches are designed by hypnotists to have certain parts deleted, to commun icate to implant the real message into the subconsc ious, hidden in the speech, the content of the speech is largely to distract th e conscious mind, to make the remainder, the comman ds, be implanted into the subconscious more effectively. See a thorough dis cussion of deletion from p 159. (See also discussi on of generalization and distortion of language in deep structure)"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 41 and what you might have chosen and is distracted 136 , Obama uses the other hypnotic programming word “believe” (also discussed above), and he ends the s entence with “a candidate you believe in deeply . ” He is not asking us to believe in him by any means. He is implanti ng the hypnotic command into a hypnotized audience that they already “chose.” Then, he is co mpiling the command by programming the audience wit h the utmost “hyper” confidence that they “believe in (him) deeply .” The reason he sounds so confident is because he is inputting a hypnotic command. Notice the pause after to allow “deeply” to sink in. Let’s look at this phrase again: “All of you chose to support a candidate you believ e in deeply .” When thinking about this language carefully, it bec omes clear how unusual it is. A candidate may say “thank you for believing in me”, or “please believe in me”, or might say in any number of ways that hi s supporters believe in him. But to simply say as if it were fact “you believe in me” is unprecedented. If he didn’t use hypnosis, people would stop and say “no we don’t”, or “who are you to tell us what we belie ve.” However, people are so entranced, it slipped past e veryone. And how odd is it that a candidate would say “all of you chose ” and then refer to himself as a candidate “you bel ieve in deeply .” This is beyond presumptuous, and beyond any confident political sp eak. He is not saying he will be President. He is telling us what we “believe.” He is telling us wha t we believe as though it is fact. He is telling u s something he could never know, as though it is fact . This is a fundamental of hypnotic programming, t hat he does not convince the rational mind with logical basis, he simply puts the subject into trance, and literally tells them what they believe. And, he says we “bel ieve” this “ deeply .” People don’t speak like that accidentally about others’ feelings. 137 This is all unacceptable as either arrogance, pol itical confidence, or coincidence. Especially the word “deeply” a word t hat does not even require explanation to sound like hypnotic programming. This is a slip up that he go t away with. It is hypnosis commands intentionally being laid by Obama in the subconscious minds of th e audience. Notice again the hypnotic programming words “chose” , “believe”, the same ones that were analyzed earli er at the beginning of this same speech, again, back t o back, this time, in the same sentence. He was cl early in the same train of thought as he was while drafting the earlier part of this speech. Then Obama anchors to himself this concept of belie ving in this candidate deeply. Then, a moment righ t after he says “deeply” (it needn’t be simultaneous 138 ), in his next sentence he does his thumb and foref inger hypnotic anchor, and points to his torso with his f ingers in that position, subconsciously associating in the audience those deep feelings and emotions with hims elf. That next sentence is about “we aren’t the re ason you came out.” For this, he would have no logical reason to point to himself at the word “reason” –   136 Also notice how he doesn’t say “you believe in me. ” He leaves it to the subconscious mind to put tha t together to make it as subconscious as possible. 137 Before this phrase, Obama says “there are young pe ople, and African Americans, and Hispanic Americans , and women of all ages who have voted in numbers and who have inspire d a nation.” But he is not referring to these peop le when he says “All of you chose a candidate you believe in deeply, though me may be trying to reserve that as an excuse. Th e reason is, he doesn’t say “all of them chose”, he says “all of you chose.” He is talking about these people in the t hird person, and he is saying this hypnotic phrase in the second person. As an attorney, he kn ows this is incorrect, and that he is applying this phrase to his entire audience, not just the people he listed prior. 138 The Power of Conversational Hypnosis, Clifford Mee and Igor Ledochowski, on the discussion of pacing with body language as an example, of how subconscious gestures need no t be simultaneous to be effective, and delay of a c ouple of seconds is effective, and sometimes necessary, including so as to not be obvious."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 42 especially when all of his other hand gestures are timed well to correspond to his words. There is no other explainable reason for his thumb and forefinger to be in that position, and then turn it inward to poi nt to his torso. As discussed below, in Obama’s 2008 Denver Democrat ic Convention Speech, he uses this exact same technique of his thumb and forefinger, talking abou t John F. Kennedy, then pointing that hand gesture inward toward his torso a moment later, to create a subconscious association between himself and JFK. Odd once to be sure, but caught twice, or more, wit h the same hand gesture, it is no coincidence. 139 Obama caught pacing and leading again In another classic Obama pace and lead, notice how he gets the crowd all roused up around 20:40, with his peak speech, peaking in intensity, emotion, volume, and rate so much so he doesn’t have even a high or low at the beginning or end of his points. He discusse s how teachers should be paid more, everyone should have healthcare, and then he says “that’s the change we need ...that’s why I’m running for President (pause ) of the United States.” Again, this is his classic pac e and lead. It makes no sense that because we need those miraculous changes he described, that is the reason why the President should be none other than him. Logically he has not said why he should be the one, what he would do, or anything of the sort. Howeve r, because his leading is so powerful, it is something the cheering audience believes in strongly, he add s the element of causation, “that’s why” and then his two part lead, 1. President, and 2. (reinforcing it ag ain) of the United States. Because this lead is embedded i n our subconscious, we simply create the logic to j ustify how we feel – the missing component – that supposit ion that Obama is the person who can and will creat e this type of change and make all these miracles hap pen. Obama’s 2007 California Democratic Convention “turn the page” speech – further analysis “Turn the page” is not just colorful visual metaph or that Obama happens to like to say. In Obama’s 2 007 “turn the page” speech he uses the phrase “turn the page” fourteen (14) separate times. 140 141 He uses it as a hypnotic anchor, and as a preprogrammed response, to stir emotion, and as a hypnotic metaphor. Obama using “turn the page” as a preprogrammed resp onse: A preprogrammed response is anything to which your body has already been conditioned to react to with a certain response. For instance, you have been alre ady preprogrammed to know that change is a 100%   139 It appears Obama does this a third time in his spe ech on race in Philadelphia, when he says Telling s tory about a poor kid, he says, “Now, Ashley might have made a different choi ce”, then he hand gestures like writing with a pen, clarifying the meaning of his thumb and forefinger trademark, similarly as he does in his 2008 Denver speech, discussed in that analysis. Then, while talking, a moment later, he gestures to himself wit h the thumb and forefinger his anchor - making the subconscious message that he is that “different choice.” 140 Barack Obama’s speech to California Democratic Con vention, 2007 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZUXhCW-OGM 141 Transcript, Obama’s Turn the Page speech, April 29 , 2007, available, e.g. http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/2007/04/bar ack_obamas_t_2.html "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 43 certainty, and when you are reading and holding the page in your hand “turning the page” is a 100% certainty. When a person reading gets to the end o f the page, the decision to turn the page is automa tic, subconscious. It also happens at a time when we ar e reading, and in trance. This is something each o f us is programmed with because we have each rehearsed this thousands of times by turning pages in books, students and more intellectual people even more so. It is an automatic reaction. What Obama tries to do is apply that level of certainty and automaticnesss to your decision to support him as President. Obama using “turn the page” as a hypnotic anchor: “Turn the page” is also used by Obama as a hypnotic anchor, to cause you to recall his planted hypnoti c suggestions when you are in the voting booth, with the pen in your hand like his thumb and forefinger, the other primary anchor. It is a hypnotic anchor that is used very cleverly by Obama by taking advantage of a preprogrammed response in the subject. Turn the pa ge is not just a vague and colorful way to say that Obama will improve America. It is designed to be t riggered when we are holding the pen and “turning t he page” in the voting booth. The vagueness of such l anguage used in hypnosis, and the multiple meanings , as discussed aove, are part of precisely what makes it work. See the discussion on secondary meanings, embedded commands, surface versus deep structure, a nd trans-derivation. Obama’s Democratic Convention speech 2008 142 – A “play by play” of his undeniable and extensive anchoring, pacing, leading, and delivery of subconscious commands This first example isn’t a documented hypnosis tech nique, just a bit of classic deception that is part of Obama’s show. When Bill Clinton gave his speech ea rlier in the Convention, he could barely get starte d for minutes because the applause and cheering was so lo ud he genuinely could not speak, and it refused to die down. Obama didn’t have that problem, so he faked it. He didn’t have such applause and cheering, but he fak ed it by pretending it was so loud he couldn’t speak, and pretending it was interrupting him, saying “thank you”, pausing and allowing the low level of applause to c ontinue, and then saying “thank you” again, and repeating, as if he was trying (though not really) to quiet down the unquietable crowd. Comparing his opening to Bill Clinton’s, it is clear that Bill Cl inton genuinely could not speak, and Obama could ea sily speak over the much quieter cheering and applause h ad he wanted to. Before I discuss Obama’s use of hypnosis in his spe ech, I really have to point out one other amusing p oint. Obama said “I am grateful to finish this journey wi th one of the finest statesmen of our time.” (refe rring to Joe Biden) What journey is he finishing that is al most over? Wouldn’t he be President for four years ? Americans certainly hope the end of the election se ason is not the end . This is a slip. He looks at the election as the journey because his entire mission is simply to make it into the Presidency before we realize what he is doing, or who he really is. Obama’s typical pacing, leading, storytelling, and hidden meanings induction: Above in this document under the heading “What is “ pacing and leading”, and how does Obama use this hypnosis technique?” – are listed Obama’s use of th ree pacing statements fourteen times in this speech which are not repeated in this section.   142 Obama’s Democratic National Convention Nominee Acc eptance Speech, August 28, 2008, available at http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/28/barack-oba ma-democratic-c_n_122224.html"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 44 Again, like all of Obama’s other major speeches ana lyzed in this document, he starts off with hypnotic storytelling. This is not because he figures we wo uld all want to hear a story. His calculation is h ow to get the quickest and deepest trace induction without an yone knowing what he is doing. Obama says: “Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story, of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren' t well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America their son could achieve what ever he put his mind to. It is that promise that's always set this country apart, that through hard wo rk and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams, but still come together as one A merican family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams, as well. That's why I stand here tonight .” Again, Obama uses hypnotic storytelling in his unna turally slow pace. The story starts past tense, to have you imagine another time and place. The story is also a pacing statement, “I stood befo re you and told you my story” which is a present ac count of exactly what he is doing now, an accurate curren t representation of the subject’s ongoing verifiabl e experience because he is standing before us now tel ling a story. This is a very powerful trance induc tion technique, because Obama tells a story, forcing you to apply and use imagination, an altered state of mind and different perspective, to look at the present s ituation. He is making you apply an altered and subconscious state of mind to your present experien ce of watching his speech. The well-off or well-known statement is again, a pl ay on words for dominant hemisphere linguistic distraction in order to access the non-dominant hem isphere per Erickson’s three dimensions of hypnosis . He is already pacing, and the play on words is prec isely the type of “utilization of the dominant hemi sphere, language processing which occurs below the level of awareness.” 143 Your dominant hemisphere below the level of awareness analyzes this play on words, and becomes distracted, leaving it open for implantati on of hypnotic suggestion. Then, sure enough, notice how he flashes his thumb and forefinger gesture again starting with when he says the word (shared a) “belief.” The “belief “ that h e is anchoring here is: that in America their son, (Obama) could achieve anything he set his mind to. It is difficult to follow consci ously, but that is the belief they shared. What in fact their son has set his mind to, is to become President . Consciously, it is difficult to follow that when Obama says “belief”, and anchors i t with his hand gesture, Obama is really anchoring himself achieving the Presidency. He is anchoring and implanting the command of his becoming Presiden t without expressly saying it, so it remains subconsc ious. Notice his words, “promise”, “hard work”, “sacrific e”, “each of us can pursue our individual dreams” a nd then ends the paragraph with “That is why I stand h ere tonight.” Promise, hard work, sacrifice, each of us   143 Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. E rickson, M.D. Volume 1, p 218 - Utilization of play s on words in hypnotic induction works because, in addition to employment of conscious linguistic processing mechanisms, it “ activates additional meaning recovery processes which develop meanings w hich are available to the to the unconscious portio n of the client’s mind but not the conscious.” – What Erickson’s book mean s by this is that the “play on words” isn’t caught consciously, but trips up and confuses your subconscious linguistic processin g mechanisms, thereby facilitating the distraction necessary for hypnotic induction.

In no logical way however does Obama connect these beauti ful concepts to why he would make a great President . Instead, he simply uses causation, the strongest Er icksonian linkage statement, and says “That is why I stand here tonight.” This statement is a brilliant use o f Ericksonian hypnosis techniques, including pacing and leading, because this statement is both a pace and a lead in one. Obama has actually set it up in the run up to this paragraph, so “that is why I stand here ton ight” – is both a pace, as it is immediately and ve rifiably true that he is in fact standing there tonight. Al so, he has set it up in the whole preceding paragra ph, that what this obviously true statement means, is that h e will become President, by starting with and conne cting his parents dream, and stating all the beautiful co ncepts, and then saying “that is why....” he stands there tonight – obviously meaning he is there because he wants the Presidency. This is the really clever part. When he says “that is why I stand here tonight”, your subconscious mi nd accepts that as absolutely true. But the question is, which interpretation? 1. That he is literally standing there tonight? or 2. That he is standing there so his parents’ dream will be realized? or 3. That he is standing there is because that promise, hard work, sacrifice, and our children’s dreams is the reason why he is there? The mind is distracted with this trans-d erivational problem that occurs below the level of awareness. Meanwhile, the subconscious mind accept s all three interpretations as absolute truth. Remember, the subconscious mind cannot make rationa l distinctions. Once the subconscious mind labels this statement (that is why I stand here tonight) a s absolutely true, it accepts it, including all of its meanings, including hidden meanings. You look at him standin g there tonight and confirm below your level of awareness that that statement is true on one level, and that acts as a confirmation of the other meani ngs in the paragraph, that his parents dream will be reali zed, and that promise, hard work, sacrifice, and ou r children’s dreams is the reason why he is there. And remember, this all awhile you are e ntranced by his unnaturally slow, poetic, melodic, hypnotic storyte lling, imagination provoking, emotion provoking, an d passion provoking content. He doesn’t send this me ssage to you consciously, but intentionally and powerfully implants and programs you with it subcon sciously. The statement that is verifiably true is the very s ame statement that means he will achieve the Presid ency and associates him with all those beautiful concept s. This is no coincidence. This is classic embedd ed suggestion programming containing every element in hypnosis trance induction through all of the requir ed elements, from pacing and leading, to pacing, distr action, and utilization of the non-dominant hemisph ere. It is beautifully crafted and advanced Ericksonian hypnosis. He uses the same phrase “that is why I stand here t onight” again at least two more times later on in t he speech. Millions of people feel like voting for Ob ama and cant point to an accomplishment or change h e has brought. This hypnotic gamesmanship is the cau se for many. Obama caught stacking language patterns Obama’s speech contains similar hypnosis techniques throughout, including this very same technique immediately following the previous command. This r epetition of hypnotic language patterns one after t he other is typical stacking language patterns, and is very effective at subconscious programming without conscious awareness. Obama follows the above with: “Because...Every time our nation has been in jeopar dy, ordinary men and women” (points to his audience) ...students, teachers, nurses, janitors. ..had the “Courage” (points to his audience) “to ke ep it alive.” “We meet at one of those defining momen ts now.”"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 46 He paces everyone in the audience by talking about “ordinary men and women, teachers, students, ....” for identification. Then, notice how he points to the audience when he says “defining moments”, as if vot ing for him will define us e.g., as open minded, as courageous. While diffic ult to follow consciously, he just said, essentially, that because you (points) have h ad courage (points) at every dark time, and this is one of those times, that is why he is standing before us. The pace and lead is again a single statement, “we meet at one of those defining moments.” Again, sam e technique as in the previous sentence. You can imm ediately verify that we indeed are meeting, at this moment, and thus you subconsciously accept this sta tement as a true pace. When this statement is acce pted as true, you again also accept as true all the othe r programming and meaning that Obama sends along wi th it into your subconscious. What logical sense does th at make though? What does him standing there have to do with people’s courage throughout history? Becau se he is standing there people can pursue their dre ams? At 15:50, Obama uses this same technique again. After discussing economic issues, building emotion by mentioning a waitress who can take off from work to take care of a sick kid without being fired, and ha ving an economy that honors the dignity of work, Ob ama says: “The fundamentals we use to measure economic streng th are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country grea t - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.” He starts out saying things nobody can disagree wit h, and building emotion. Again, he uses causality to link beautiful and emotional concepts he conjures up to himself with causation language that logically is completely without any logical support. Why use th is language of causation without any basis for it, when there is no need for causation language “the only r eason.” More importantly, yet again, Obama links these beau tiful concepts with causation to a statement that i s both verifiably true in the literal sense in order to im plant the meaning he has built into it. He talks a bout “the fundamental promise that has made this country grea t”, and says “a promise that is the only reason I a m standing here tonight.” He uses language about the promises that make this country great and builds t hat meaning into “that is why I am standing here tonigh t.” He doesn’t say “that is why I am running for President.” “I am standing here tonight” is someth ing more easily and immediately verifiable and serv es as a more literal and effective pacing statement. Whe n your mind accepts the statement “that’s why I am standing here tonight” as absolutely true, it allow s it to pass into the subconscious. However, this statement has two meanings, 1. that he is in fact literally standing there, and 2. the meaning he built into h imself standing there, he is there to make sure that we ar e living up to the fundamental promise that has mad e this country great. When your mind accepts “that’s why I am standing here tonight” as absolutely true, all meanings attached to it are absorbed into the subco nscious as true, because your subconscious mind can not differentiate and rationalize which meaning he inte nded. What he is doing is no coincidence and no accident. He is repeatedly setting up language patterns that support subconscious beliefs of why he should be President to intersect and be embedded within statements immediately verifiable by the subconscio us as absolutely true, such as “that is why I stand here tonight”, or “we meet at one of those defining moments.” Then, the audience sees him standing there as he says it, processes this below the level of conscious awareness, and unknowingly accepts subconscious programming as absolute truth consisti ng of all of the underlying meanings he has set"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 47 up to correspond with the obvious surface statement . Nobody just happens to speak like that. Not once, let alone again and again, one after the othe r. *Obama caught clarifying his hand gesture as unmist akable hypnotic anchor of writing with pen (twice): You have to watch these videos. As he says “the on ly reason I am standing here tonight, he waves his palm towards his chest, taking that emotion and saying “ me”, then he points upward signaling “command”, and then he does this: Right after that, at 16:22, right after he says, “t he only reason I am standing here tonight” analyzed above, notice his hand gesture when he says “the faces of those young veterans.” Notice how he appears to be writing with a pen, to complete the three-part hidd en hand gesture, “me” “command” and “write”(or probably “vote”). At 16:22 – his gesture of writin g with a pen is unmistakable. Similarly, at 6:51, Obama also clarifies his hand g esture. He says, “more of you have lost your homes , and even more” and at that moment, he does a very stran ge thing with his thumb in forefinger technique, cl early making a gesture as if he is using his hand as a pe n writing. It is unmistakable. We don’t conscious ly recognize it, but he anchors us for when we are hol ding the pen in the voting booth, thereby clarifyin g for us subconsciously the meaning of his consistent thumb and forefinger anchor. (being our hand, our pen) Watching this video of these two of Obama’s hand ge stures, no reasonable person would believe Obama accidentally made these gestures. You can watch th ese scenes in these videos all day long and you can not come up with another reasonable explanation for wha t he is doing than hypnotic programming. A few tidbits:: Obama says “come together” – notice his hands towar ds his mid section, to signal come together to him . He points to us as he says “(these) challenges,” su ggesting that we are being challenged, or that we h ave a challenge to fulfill i.e. to follow his commands. Look at how he blends commands to stay in trance in to his speech. He says at 17:08 “When I listen to another worker tell me his factory is shut down.” – listen to how he enunciates “listen”, to keep peop le subconsciously listening to his voice. When he says we are “better than this...more descen t” notice how he uses his hand palm towards himself , to send us the signal subconsciously that he is ‘bette r” and “descent.” He does the thumb and finger anchor again as he tel ls the story about the man who “chokes up” – anchor ing the symbol with our emotion. This is just before t he primary command explained below. He also does an unmistakable hand gesture for the w ord “keep” just before the primary command explaine d below. He says “we are more compassionate” and again puts his palm towards his chest, to send the message tha t he is compassionate. The reason this is deceptive and manipulative, is t hat Obama is not telling us that Obama is compassio nate,"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 48 nor is he providing any logical basis for us to bel ieve that he is compassionate. He pretends he is t alking about someone else. He is tricking our subconsciou s minds to believe that he is compassionate without even telling our conscious minds that he is communicatin g that message. Consciously, we can’t even analyze it or make a rational judgment about it because we are not even aware of having received the message. Obama caught giving the primary hypnotic command of the speech: After having raised in us a number of emotions, and having paced considerably, and prepared us for a hypnotic suggestion, Obama delivers the following p aragraph, his primary hypnotic command of the speech: Tonight, (pace - it is tonight) I say to the Americ an people (pace - he is obviously saying to the American people), to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough! This moment (pace - it is this moment) - this elect ion (pace - it is this election) - is our chance to keep (thumb and forefinger anchor - as in to keep h is hypnotic messages), in the 21st century (pace), the American promise alive (pace – who would disagr ee). Because (causality linking statement) next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brough t you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third. And we a re here (pacing) because (causality linking statement) we love this country (pace) too much to let the next four years look like the last eight. On November 4th, we must (strongest command word possi ble) stand up and say: \"Eight is enough.\" The command is not “eight is enough.” Obama executes the hypnotic lead that follows his e motional stirring and pacing just before that, as h e says, “on November fourth, on November fourth!” Obama sa ys “on November fourth” twice, attempting to make it seem as if he unintentionally double-spoke. 144 However, this is very intentional. Notice how he has his thumb and forefinger together anchoring “November f ourth”, together with the emotion he just stirred u p, for the first time he says “on November fourth” He does this so we will recall his hypnotic messages and programs and emotions when we hold the pen in the v oting booth. Then, notice how the second time he says “on Novemb er fourth” with the same hand that was thumb and forefinger for the first, he changes it to firmly p oint. He is pointing, which is the international a nd subconscious signal that he is giving us a command. Frowning and pointing is a common technique in conversational hypnosis to get someone to do someth ing, because on the subconscious level, we perceive it as a command that we must perform, regardless wheth er consciously we feel like we are doing it voluntarily. 145 Look at the firmness of his point, with a serious face perhaps a slight frown, as he says it the second time. Obama is not asking us for our vote, h e is absolutely commanding it. One website even discuses how angry Obama appeared during parts of h is speech. 146 He is commanding all subconscious minds under his trance to support Obama.   144 In fact, it was so good at looking accidental;, th at the written speech transcript only has “on Novem ber fourth” once. 145 The Power of Conversational Hypnosis, Clifford Mee and Igor Ledowchowski, p104 of 631, “And likewise, when you are suing ‘command’ tonality, maybe you want to frown a bit. I used to point my finger at an imaginary cl ient, and then give him instructions. So that, every time I pointed my fin ger and frowned, my voice started going down, becau se the physiology of commands, or instructions, is to point and frown sl ightly, and really get someone to do something. 146 The Angry Barack Obama Acceptance Speech, August 2 9th, 2008, http://www.mikefrancesa.com/wordpress/?p=1011"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 49 It is easily proven that his double-speak is intent ional, because his hand gestures are so pronounced and clear, and how clearly he switches from one hand ge sture, the anchor, to the second, the command. Wer e the double speak accidental, he would not have such clear and definitive and purposeful and different hand gestures. The reason he says “On November fourth” twice is because he is giving us a two-part hypnoti c command, 1. recall the hypnotic commands by the hyp notic anchor, and 2. act on them and vote for me – both commands to be recalled “on November fourth” – That’s why he gives you the specific date. . This is undoubltable evidence that he is implanting commands in a way we are not designed to be consciously aware of. He doesn’t coincidentally ha ppen to again use the hypnotic anchor, and the poin ting technique. Notice how these are the same gestures he uses in his statement for the same two principle s, reception of the hypnotic message, and taking the c ommanded action by voting, that he uses in his over t hypnotic statement discussed above: “a light will shine down from somewhere, it will li ght upon you, you will experience an epiphany, and you will say to yourself, “I have to vote for B arack”’ Any forgiveness of this is simply because one may n ot understand how powerful and effective such techniques are. How effective these tricks of Obam a’s are, can only be shown by the effects – million s of people completely irrationally in love with him, an d compelled to vote for him. While you do not see it as consciously swaying you in any way, as of course it doesn’t logically, or you may not even notice it, in fact, it is a powerful command that compels millions to w ant him president, regardless how they feel logical ly. Obama’s aggressive pointing- the subconscious signa l of giving commands: Here are some general examples of Obama aggressivel y pointing – the hypnotic symbol for giving a command. 147 At this point, Obama goes into a pattern, as he occ asionally does, where his hand gestures just normal ly flow with the conversation without any specific mea ning for the most part – essentially using his hand s the way be believe he always is, in order to not be obv ious. Shortly thereafter, Obama anchors the word “believe ” yet again with his usual thumb and forefinger   147 Images from Democratic National Convention speech in Denver, 2008 (as examples of aggressive pointing , like those he uses as commands, not necessarily designed to coincide w ith specific commands discussed.)

Is it again a coincidence? If there we re no rhyme or reason to his hand gestures, why is it that he uses the same thumb and forefinger gesture for the same word (“belief”) that he anchored the same way at the start of his speech? He is subconsciously trai ning us to “believe’ his hypnotic programming. Obama caught in another hypnotic command, anchor, a nd a strategic pause: Obama then says 15:50 “its time for us to change Am erica...” (pacing statement) “... and that’s why I’m running for President (pause) of the United States. ” (causality linking statement and the lead, deliv ered again with his standard hypnotic anchor, the thumb and forefinger flash) This is another classic Obam a 1. pace 2. causality linking language 3. lead 4. hypno tic anchor in which he inputs the hypnotic command - that he will be President of the United States, to be recalled in the voting booth on November fourth. Why does he pause between ”President” and “of the U nited States”? Because when you are in the voting booth holding the pen as he has anchored, and all t hese commands are coming back, when you read the actual ballot, it reads, “President”, and then on t he next line below, “of the United States” 148 , and as you read the ballot in the voting booth, you will subco nsciously pause for a split second as your eyes ski p because you read from one line to the next. By pau sing when he gives you the command, it will more perfectly match the situation in which you must act according to that command, to make the subconsciou s link more effective. That is how clever and strate gic and precise Obama’s hypnosis techniques are. T his is how the unconscious mind works. Everything he is d oing, the thumb and forefinger “holding the pencil” hand gestures, the pointing, the pauses, the hand g esture where he appears to be writing with a pen (i n his democratic speech), the metaphors (anchors like “tu rn the page”, are all preparing you, anchoring you for recall of all his hypnotic commands recalled by you yourself holding the pen and the ballot card that day on November fourth when you are in the voting booth. Notice his palms towards himself again when he says “rewarded by a grateful nation.” It is difficult to tell, but he may actually be implanting the subconscious suggestion that he is so wonderful, that we as a na tion must reward him (by giving him the Presidency). He talks about soldiers, and says “(these are my) h eroes” and at that moment points to himself, to cau se us to subconsciously associate the word “hero” with hi m. He then rouses emotion for the troops and hard work ing people, and says he will keep their dream alive “as President of the United States.” He uses “as” here as an implied causality, another powerful linking statement. 149 Notice then how he keeps his palms towards himsel f, as the crowd cheers, sending the message of focusing that cheering on him. This is the same gesture he uses sometimes to discuss himse lf. 150 Obama can change positions from one day to the next 151 to mirror McCain’s positions, and through his hypnotic speech make people believe that Obama feel s as strongly as McCain does on these issues.   148 http://www.londonderrynh.net/wp-content/uploads/200 8/01/20080108_dem-ballot.jpg 149 Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. E rickson, M.D. Volume 1, p147-149. The primary focu s of this document has been the linking statement using overt causatio n, the most powerful, however, other linking statem ents are also used by Obama. 150 “my background, my politics” palms inward towards himself. – his speech on race, Philadelphia. 151 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbnKoJP1_xk&feature= related 2:25-"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 51 He then anchors “we will keep our promise to every young American” with his thumb and forefinger technique – suggesting he will keep his promise to us. Obama consistently delivers a very simplistic hypno tic pace. “Now is the time...now is the time...”. The message is simply 1. pen in your hand, and 2. Obama . and 3. now is the time. Obama caught hypnotically linking himself with John F. Kennedy: Obama then mentions John F. Kennedy 27:47 (“what Jo hn F. Kennedy called our international and moral strength”), which he anchors with his thumb and for efinger. He then says “yes government must lead... but each of us” and as he says “us” he points that same thumb and forefinger anchor at himself (it doesn’t have to be simultaneous or immediate), subconsciously pr ogramming us to look upon him as John F. Kennedy. Then he repeats the word “yes’ in the middle of tha t anchoring, and does another palm towards himself, reaffirming the JFK programming yet again. It is an unlikely coincidence because he uses the s ame thumb and forefinger hand gesture to discuss Kennedy’s values, and then points that same gesture at himself a moment later. People believe he is J ohn F. Kennedy, and have no conscious awareness of the con nection that he is causing through subconscious manipulation. Notice this is the exact technique O bama used in his St. Paul speech, discussed above, when he anchored “a leader you deeply believe in.” Obama again pacing and leading This is just another of countless examples. Barack Obama said regarding healthcare: “It's time to finally challenge the special interes ts and provide universal health care for all.” (Pa ce and Pace) “That's why I'm running for President of the United States” (Lead) “because I believe that health care should be guaranteed for every American who wants it and affordable for every American who needs it.” 152 (Pace and Pace) Notice how powerful this statement by Obama sounds, while logically empty. Notice how he says that’s why he’s running for President, before the “because.” Odd to be certain, but we let is pass because we d o not understand the causation linkage that he is pre pping our subconscious for. Notice how it makes no logical sense that its time to change special inter ests and provide universal health care, that’s why I am running for President. There is no logical connect ion between those statements - Maybe that is a reas on why someone who has fought against special interest s, or someone who has solved healthcare problems or at least has knowledge about these issues should be President. However, what he says is its time to c hange Washington and provide healthcare, and “that is why I am running for President.” The purported logic comes after as to not interfere with the pace and l ead causality statement. Even that purported logi c provides no real basis. It is just another pace. If Obama would have said the reason he should be Pr esident is because he believes in healthcare, it wouldn’t work as a pace because the audience doesn’t know what he believes – that is why he uses what the audience be lieves, even though it diverges from logic in order to follow perfectly the hypnosis principle of pacing a nd leading. Because he believes healthcare should be guaranteed for everyone who wants it, and affordabl e for everyone who needs it? Who doesn’t believe that? It is a statement everyone can agree with, used as a pace. Notice how powerful this statement sounds, yet has absolutely no logical basis. Because he believ es everyone who wants medical care should have it, that   152 Remarks of Senator Barack Obama: Health Care Town Hall, Date: 06/05/2008"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 52 is why the President of the United States should be no person other than Barack Obama? The use of the most powerful linking statement here repeatedly, “b ecause”, is more that suspicious. However, the pro of, is that he is a Harvard Attorney, and he knows not to use a “because” when he is not making a proper argument that one thing causes another. Drafting s uch false logic sticks out to attorneys like a sore thumb and he cannot accidentally make this mistake once, let alone three times in one paragraph, and consist ently throughout his speeches. PART 4 – ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF OBAMA’S HYP NOSIS Obama’s technique of head turned to the right side in interviews described by body language expert as one of the most powerful subconscious man ipulation techniques possible by a speaker’s body language Notice how Obama has his head tilted to the right i n interviews such as the Fox News interview with Ch ris Wallace April 27, 2008, his ABC News Nightline inte rview, as well as the August 16, 2008 meeting with Rev. Rick Warren, 153 and many others. \u0001 154 \u0001\u0001 \u0003 \u0004\u0004 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0003 \u0004 \u0001 It is undeniable how Obama significantly tilts his head to the right in these and other interviews, bu t not when Obama is giving speeches. According to Tonya Reiman, Author of “The Power of Body Language,” such a head tilt to the right is “o ne of the most powerful manipulation tools of body lan guage.” 157 Tonya Reiman describes how there is no difference between what such gestures and manipulat ion. Barack Obama is actually manipulating you subconsciously by tilting his head without you even consciously realizing it. The reason is that tilt ing your head to the right specifically is a sign of vulnera bility, a very effective one. Per our animal insti ncts, a head tilted to the right exposes an animal’s jugular vei n, their weakness, and in turn, causes us to lower our defenses subconsciously as a counter-measure, witho ut even being consciously aware of it. This is a clear example of Obama intentionally usin g a subconscious technique for gaining trust and lowering the subconscious guard and resistance of h is audience, using one of the most powerful manipulation tools of body language.   153 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjqOXEOzSc0 See also Obama can be seen with his head tilted to the right in many interviews where he faces the cam era. Google “Obama head tilt” - See “Watching the Saddleback Church Forum with Pastor Rick Warren interviewing Senator Barack Obama on Saturday August 16, I was struck by the marked and obvious t ilting of the Senator’s head Forum .

When Oba ma lowers his head to the right as he often does, h e is not convincing us logically, he is manipulating us without our knowledge. We may say, “oh, well this doesn’t seem so bad, his head tilted to the right d oesn’t make me vote for him any more so.” You may feel none of these tactics do. In fact, because they ar e subconscious tactics, we do not realize how effec tive they are. Only after November fourth can one be sure th ey are unaffected. We are subconsciously tricked i nto trusting him more and liking him more, not logicall y, but in our internal feelings to vote for him. 158 This goes beyond deceit, and is in fact mind-control. P eople watching him listen to him, and like him, and trust him, they genuinely feel it, and it is artificially induced. Now a single tactic like this head tilt by itself has effect. However, it is when Obama combines it with hundreds of other gestures, techniques, language patterns, and other aspects of hypnosis. There is an “Obama phenomenon” of millions of people who cal l him JFK, or Jesus reincarnated, and nobody can expl ain why. We are ready to turn over the united Stat es of America to this largely unknown man and nobody can explain why. This is why. His arsenal of hypnotic and subconscious manipulation brainwashes causing a n unstoppable grade school-like crush on him in som e cases, and in others, simply pushes us over the edg e, overpowers our logical concerns, to supporting h im when we otherwise wouldn’t. Much of Obama’s body language may be considered bey ond confident, to actually manipulative. As another example, when appearing with his opponents Hillary Clinton and John McCain, in debates and elsewhere, notice how, when he shakes their hand su ch as after the debate, Obama does an additional to uch on the arm or shoulder of his opponent. He is not being friendly here. He does this to purposely app ear “commanding” and “in charge” to his audience. He i s showing that he has the right, power, and authori ty and confidence to touch this person. This is all c onscious and intentional. He even makes sure that after every debate, he takes the forefront walking across the stage at the end, to the front center, and mee ting the moderator or other people up in the front and cente r, so people are left with the end thought of him b eing at the forefront. Obama’s manipulative body language is so perfected, that you actually have to consciously detach yours elf from it to try to not be influenced by it. He neve r shows a hint of nervousness in his body language, and is always commanding in his presence. He is so strate gic in his body language, that when he is on stage with Hillary after primaries or Joe Biden talking about and praising him, he actually consciously sits slou ching a little hunching his shoulders, with his back arched in his chair, as if to put the other person as the perceived leader while they speak well of him so their messag e is more effective. Interview of Professor of Psychiatry on CNN in whic h Dr. comes close to hinting of her suspicion that Obama is using covert subconscious t echniques throughout his campaign. Excepts from an interview of Dr. Gail Saltz by Eric a Hill, Professor of Psychiatry, New York Presbyter ian Hospital, on Anderson Cooper 360, CNN June 7, 2008 22:00 EST speak for themselves. “Obama used words like \"change,\" \"hope,\" \"action.\" They have high emotional valence, particularly at this time. Clinton used words like \"conversation \" and \"leader,\" and they didn't have the same emotional valence. And in addition, Obama delivered them with a tremendous inspirational tone. That also affected things greatly. So yes, I think actually it did play a big role. ...   158 http://flickr.com/photos/jbenson2/2531469404/ The details that go into Obama’s “look”"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 54 If you think about it, a campaign is really about P R and marketing. And interestingly, the father of public relations was the nephew of Sigmund Freud. H e used those same concepts of the subconscious. And that's what we're talking about here. It's not the conscience meaning of the word: it's the unconscious emotion it evokes. Because when it's ou t of your awareness, it has the ability to make you behave and do certain things that you wouldn't if you knew it was present. ... I do think Obama really has a special talent in thi s arena of deciding what words to use with a particular valence.” Dr. Saltz seams here to strongly suggest that Obama is indeed using subconscious hypnosis techniques i n his campaign. However, she only scratches the surf ace of Obama’s techniques and does not put together the ethical issue of how deceptive and immoral his tact ics are. Hypnosis/NLP expert discusses Obama’s use of mind c ontrol techniques on radio Dr. Horton, who has been working in the field of hy pnosis and NLP for 25 years has called Obama’s methods clearly the use of hypnosis and effectively “Mind control.” 159 The discussion on this radio program 160 describes Obama’s use of the 48 Laws of Power, by Greene, a treatise on mass deception, total absence of emotion. 161 Obama is often referred to as detached emotional ly, and not just “cool” but in fact so detached as to be of concern to some people. Di scussed is Obama’s ability to project people’s hope s and dreams onto him, and Obama’s use of hypnosis to get masses to view him as the vehicle to get whatever he wants through Obama’s vague “yes we can”, “change” and “we are the ones we have been waiting for” speeches. The discussion addresses Obama’s cadence rhythm and speaking tone, taking breaks after 5-8 word phrase s, and how he cleverly uses pauses such as “together, ...as we look to the future,” to send subconscious messages we are not even aware of. One specific hand gesture being used by Obama discu ssed was Obama’s rousing emotion from the audience, and then touching his face, or tie, as a method of subconsciously transferring those emotion s onto him by bringing the person’s focus back to him whil e in that elicited state. Also discussed is how Ob ama morphs into a different person with different voice depending on which group he is talking to.

Complete mastery of the lang uage, including highly abstract pacing and leading language for creating emotion and motivatio n. In addition to the language patterns, he is fantastic at going higher up in level of abstractio n beyond details, while still managing to sound relevant. He uses Ericksonian-style language patter ns, including presuppositions and nominalizations extensively. This is only a sample of 500 words from a single sp eech, but as you can see, Obama tops the crowd using nearly 60% hypnotic language patterns. In my opinion, this is purposeful language, likely written by a very skilled speech writer — perhaps s omeone trained in Neuro-Linguistic Programming or Hypnosis. \u0001 Another website also provides similar commentary. 163 Obama uses hypnotic command to dismiss the Rev Wrig ht questions Regarding Rev. Wright, Obama in an interview with C hris Mathews on MSNBC, simply says, with his amazing hyper-confidence, “three weeks from now, ev erybody will have forgotten..” 164 He doesn’t even say, I hope this will be forgotten. He clearly sta tes it as a command. 165 That easily, for millions of Americans, the question of why he sat in a racist, anti-American church for 20 years is unimportant. When Obama faces any attack or issue that hurts him , he simply says this is the old politics, and that this issue doesn’t solve the people’s problems. He call s it a “distraction.” A word that clearly has a ve ry powerful message, to be overlooked. When the idea of a distraction is commanded hypnotically, in can, as we see, sometimes be more powerful than all the log ic which says, “wait, Obama’s character is relevant . 166 He groups everything that hurts him politically, fr om his empty record to his connections with Farakha n and Hamas, to his elitism, and all the questions about his character and patriotism under his magical umbr ella of issues that “distractions” or what he calls “fear t actics.” The rational part of one’s mind should re alize that Obama’s connections to these people, combined with how little we know about Obama disqualify him from the Presidency, but as emotional beings, many are d riven by simply wanting him as President. Obama’s speech on race March 18, 2008 Philadelphia – hypnotic storytelling throughout This speech is symbolically in the “city of brother ly love.” Notice how he carefully plans venues for such speeches, Berlin to be like JFK, “Unity” when he an d Clinton are trying to get along. Has any candida te before ever paid this much attention to such small symbolisms? Obama is using hypnotic storytelling techniques fro m the start of the speech, when Obama is talking ab out a different time, “221 years ago...in a hall that sti ll stands across the street....farmers, scholars” i n his slow rhythm, through to the end. As discussed above wit h regards to the California Convention 2007 Speech, hypnotic storytelling is a fundamental of hypnosis.

Coincidentally, Wright, happened to sh ortly thereafter come public with some more extreme comments precisely gi ving Obama another chance to now denounce him more concretely. This had the precise effect of Obama then being able to say he did denounce Wright, after Obama initially r efused to, so that the story would die down, and Wright has been largely silent since. -Another interesting coincidence nobody susp ected. 166 Obama said in his democratic convention acceptance speech that issues such as his character are off l imits."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 56 throughout. Through much of Obama’s speech, what i s a story and what is not are completely blended an d intertwined. He takes you through a host of emotio ns starting with guilt about slavery, to all types of stories about brotherly love and togetherness, meanwhile us ing his thumb and forefinger anchoring technique almost throughout, and implanting messages hidden w ithin the stories into your subconscious. He gets your imagination prevail over your rationality, and you find yourself feeling the heartwarming tales that t he people in all these stories felt, and associating t hose with him. He consistently paces throughout, “This presidential campaign” or “I chose to run for presi dent – at this moment (in history)” just two of man y pacing statements with anchors, and “this moment”, “this election”, and “this time” (repeated nearly h alf a dozen times). He builds warm emotions with generic statements lik e “We all want to move in the same direction...towa rds a better future...for our children and grandchildre n.” The way he dismisses the whole Rev. Wright affair w ithout discussing how he could have not known Wright was racist and anti-American (which he denie s) is by saying he is “not the most conventional candidate.” Notice how you have to agree with it be cause you do not have time to dissect what part of non- conventional is due to his race, and what part is d ue to something improper that he has done for twent y years. At 4:56 he says “A story that has seared into my ge netic makeup the idea that this nation is more than the sum of its parts, that out of many, we are truly on e”, meanwhile pointing down as if to command almost the whole way through that statement. Notice how many times he talks about being one with his audience. This is building and reinforcing a subconscious con nection with his audience, often by using his hypno tic anchor hand gesture. In fact, such stories are desi gned to “sear” their way into your subconscious wit h the message that he and you, the subject, “are truly on e.” More include “let us all find our common stake in one-another”, and “we can come together.” He descr ibes children of different races getting along at multiple times throughout the speech. He tells sto ries containing embedded all the warm feelings that he in fact places into the subconscious minds of the audi ence, which warms, or at least thaws the outrage ov er Wright. 167 He beautifully plays the audience like a violin tak ing positions on both sides, and criticizing from a ll angles and perspectives. In the end, we forget that he fa ils to address what he calls “nagging questions” be cause he cannot. They aren’t “questions”, they are impossib ilities for which there is no answer, but which he dances around and dodges beautifully. It is impossible th at he could not have know his pastor’s true views a nd character for twenty years. It is impossible that someone who says “g-d.d-mn America” loves this coun try in the same way as someone who is shocked by these words. It is impossible that Obama had he good and strong character, would have stayed in that church. It is impossible, that had Obama possessed good judgment, that he would have stayed in that church. It is impossible, that had Obama not agreed with such views, would have stayed in that church. In the end, he convinces many on emotion and warm f eelings driven through to the subconscious through continuous hypnotic storytelling, telling hypnotic story after hypnotic story each with a theme about how he wants the audience to feel. Obama ends up slipping out of the consequences of a personal history what would rationally have destroyed any candidate.   167 The Power of Conversational Hypnosis, Clifford Mee and Igor Ledochowski, How to Destroy Resistance Wi th Stories: Priming the Subconscious Mind, p246-247."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 57 Obama’s hypnotic logo Obama adds to this by giving a visual point of fixa tion – his logo. No doubt that one intended meanin g, of many, is that the circle is also an “O” for “O”bama . By itself that is not all that significant. Obama’s logo is highly hypnotic, because unlike any other logo in presidential history, you do not loo k at it, but through it. One subconsciously looks though the circle to the light inside, like the light at the end of the tunnel, without consciously realizing it. This vis ual point of focus is helpful in multiple ways to f ocus one’s attention, as well as to distract the critical fact or. Notice how it is always there on the podium – a small one in the middle, just enough for your conscious mind to miss, but for you to see subconsciously. Additionally, Obama’s logo looks very much like a c rystal ball. Notice how it looks like it is shinin g brightly. Crystal balls are used by hypnotists as one of their favorite focus points for aiding in tr ance induction. 168 Also notice how Obama’s podium messages are never s omething like “country first” like McCain has, which needs conscious interpretation. Obama’s podi um messages are always simplistic hypnotic commands including the words “Need” or “Believe” or “Change. ” A common Obama podium message is the word in large letters “CHANGE”, and beneath it “WE NEED.” The reason this is hypnotic, and part of his hypnot ic trance induction, is because the message is vague, and has two meanings because it can be read both as “change we need”, and as “we need change.” Per the discussion on trans-derivation in this document, a s your mind tries to figure out which meaning is inte nded (and cannot resolve it because both are in fac t intended) your mind is subject to trance induction and distraction, while your subconscious mind becom es more accepting of suggestion. Obama’s strange hand gesture & hand-holding convers ation with Senator Lieberman In a very unusual report, Obama is reported to grab another Senator with whom he is in a disagreement with, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, and lead him by the ha nd across the Senate floor and then speak to Lieber man in a passionate manner with strange had gestures. 169 The reason this is strange, is, besides the investi gation of Obama for use of hypnosis in his speeches and other aspects of his campaign, is that the descript ion of this “heated conversation” sounds somewhat l ike some very specific hypnotic induction techniques, i ncluding one hand and handshake instant induction techniques. 170   168 Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. E rickson, M.D. Volume 1, p189 re use of crystal ball s in trance induction. 169 Obama in heated Conversation with Lieberman http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/04/lieberman- carries- mccains_n_105179.html 170 The Handshake Induction (from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_H._Erickson ) Confusion is the basis of Erickson's famous hypnoti c handshake. Many actions are learned and operate a s a single \"chunk\" of behavior: shaking hands and tying shoelaces being t wo classic examples. If the behavior is diverted or frozen midway, the person literally has no mental space for this - he is stop ped in the middle of unconsciously executing a beha vior that hasn't got a \"middle\". The mind responds by suspending itself in trance until either something happens to give a ne w direction, or it \"snaps out\". A skilled hypnotist can often use that moment ary confusion and suspension of normal processes to induce trance quickly and easily. By interrupting the pattern of a \"normal\" handshake in some way, the hypnotist causes the subject to w onder what is going on. If the handshake continues to develop in a way which i s out-of-keeping with expectations, a simple, non-v erbal trance is created,"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 58 The article states: “Obama In Heated Conversation With Lieberman, June 4, 2008 12:24 PM, Sam Stein, The Huffington Post: Furthermore, during a Senate vote Wednesday, Obama dragged Lieberman by the hand to a far corner of the Senate chamber a nd engaged in what appeared to reporters in the gallery as an intense, three-minute conversatio n. While it was unclear what the two were discussing, the body language suggested that Obama was trying to convince Lieberman of something and his stance appeared slightly intimida ting. Using forceful, but not angry, hand gestures, Obama literally backed up Lieberman again st the wall, leaned in very close at times, and appeared to be trying to dominate the conversat ion, as the two talked over each other in a few instances. Still, Obama and Lieberman seemed t o be trying to keep the back-and-forth congenial as they both patted each other on the bac k during and after the exchange. Afterwards, Obama smiled and pointed up at reporter s peering over the edge of the press gallery for a better glimpse of their interaction. Obama loyalists were quick to express their frustration with Lieberman’s decision and warned th at if he continues to take a lead role in attacking Obama it could complicate his professiona l relationship with the Caucus.” 171 It sounds more unbelievable than to even suggest se riously, but certain aspects of the “conversation” just have hypnotist written all over it. This report is not inconsistent with the absurd-sounding possibil ity that Obama tried to use hypnotic techniques on Senator L ieberman right there on the Senate floor. This inc ludes the motive, Lieberman’s recent criticisms of Obama, and Obama’s alleged method of grabbing Senator Lieberman by the hand and leading him by the hand a cross the Senate floor (see handholding as part of instant induction techniques), the forceful hand ge stures, backing Lieberman up against the wall, and leaning in very close, appearing to try to dominate the conversation, the patting on the back, all unt il being apparently interrupted by reporters. 172 Obama’s use of a fake presidential seal Obama at one speech had on the front of his podium a fake presidential seal which he created, which lo oked like the Presidential Seal of the United States, ex cept with a few modifications such as “Obama” writt en on it, and his hypnotic logo in the center. 173 This was likely an attempt at another subconsciou s message        which may then be reinforced or utilized by the hyp notist. All these responses happen naturally and au tomatically without telling the subject to consciously focus on an idea. The various descriptions of Erickson's hypnotic han dshake, including his own very detailed accounts, i ndicate that a certain amount of improvisation is involved, and that watch ing and acting upon the subject's responses is key to a successful outcome. The most important thing is that the \"normal\" hands hake is subverted in such a way to cause puzzlement , which may then be built upon. Richard Bandler was a keen proponent of the handshake induction, a nd developed his own variant, which is commonly tau ght in NLP workshops. Any habitual pattern which is interrup ted unexpectedly will cause sudden and light trance . The handshake is a particularly good pattern to interrupt because the formality of a handshake is a widely understood set of social rules. Since everyone knows that it would be impolite to comment on the quality of a handshake, regardless of how s trange it may be, the subject is obliged to embark on an inner search (kn own as a transderivational search , a universal and compelling type of trance) to identify the meaning or purpose of the subverted pa ttern. \u0001 (see also “instant induction techniques” online, su ch as “one handed induction”) 171 Obama in heated Conversation with Lieberman http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/04/lieberman- carries- mccains_n_105179.html 172 See previous footnote on instant induction and han dshake induction. 173 http://www.victoriataft.com/2008/06/obama-unveils-p residential-seal.html "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 59 looking Presidential, that, like the light shining down statement described above, was caught and ridi culed because of its impropriety. Both probably without went without anyone’s conscious awareness of their small role in Obama’s broader hypnotic efforts. Bo th were simply ridiculed because of their improprie ty. This could be argued to simply have been an effort by Obama to appear Presidential, but why the subtle modifications then and why his logo in the middle? Assorted other points: Obama often uses a variety of other subconscious ve rbal tricks. At 4:55 pm on September 24, 2008, in a response to McCain suspending his campai gn as a show of non-partisanship to work on the economy, Obama made a statement about how in th is crisis, there are some immediate aspects, and also some long term aspects that the net admini stration will have to deal with. Then he says in the next few sentences “we”...”we” several times, a nd then follows up with how “we” will have to deal with those long term issues down the road. He separated it so he was not obviously saying that he will be the next administration, but subconsciou sly, that is probably an intentionally sent message. There are too many issues to address, and too many hypnotic techniques to look into even in a single speech. However, here are a few miscellaneo us points. Notice how often he starts his turn speaking with t he words “Now look...” Not just once or twice, but repeatedly, especially when he is in trouble in an interview or conversation. When Obama first introduces Biden as his vice presi dent to take the stage with Obama for the first tim e, Obama announces Biden as, “the next president of th e United States” and then corrects himself to say v ice- president, as if he misspoke. It is difficult to k now whether Obama did this on purpose to make peopl e who are uncomfortable with him feel more at ease as tho ugh Biden would be running the show. Perhaps he misspoke, but then again, how often does Obama miss peak? ...As compared to his proven prior acts of misspeaking purposely as part of subconscious tacti cs. Notice Obama’s sparkling eye-shadow makeup. On Hannity and Colmes, Mary Matalin said Obama was “attacking McCain subliminally”, calling McCain “confused.” In another Obama ad, when McCain was c riticized for not knowing how many houses he owned, the voice slowly paused before saying “he ca nt remember,” in a deep powerful voice. Clearly th is was a similar tactic to get people to be concerned about McCain’s age. When Hillary had lost the nomination, Obama came to meet with her. As the story was relayed, Obama ha d all journalists board his plane to cover him, and t hen, in an unbelievable move, Obama sent his plane, without him , to another city to intentionally do away with the press so Obama could talk to Clinton privately without journalists there.        "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 60 Regarding the lipstick on a pig comment, it is hard to know whether Obama intended this to be subconscious or not. However, on Wednesday Septemb er 10, 2008 in what appeared to be a small library, Obama did try to cover it up. He said, “nobody act ually believes...” that the McCain camp is offended . Notice how much emphasis he puts on his favorite pr ogramming word “believes” – and the huge pause thereafter. That is not (supposedly) the end of th e idea nor the sentence. Why a huge pause and emph asis if that were not the end of the idea? Notice how the whole statement is made as if it were a command, “nobody actually believes!” Notice how Obama copies and piggybacks the popular points of every candidate he is going against. Thi s is so people will look at him as equal to every issue logically, and only differentiate Obama on the issu es where he chooses to, where he is strongest. It all ows him to appropriate the best of the other candid ates without ever taking a position. Look at how he do es this even in debates. He would allow Hillary to answer a question with her wealth of experience, an d then he says that he would have given the same answer, sometimes even using a metaphor like “dovet ail” but he is also Barack Obama. Remember how starkly different he was than John McCain? What is sues can one name where he is even describably different than McCain on? PART 5 – THE VISIBLE EFFECTS OF OBAMA’S HYPNOSIS The effects of his hypnosis are undeniable “The unconscious mind (where Obama is implanting hi s hypnotic commands) is the source of our energy. No amount of will power exerted by the conscious mi nd can override it.” Modern Hypnosis Theory and Practice, Masud Ansari, Ph..D., p43. - this is wh y many people are so passionate about Obama. Nobod y knows who, not even they. It is difficult to know how many people have been affected and how much unt il November 4 th when people actually vote. Because of Obama’s tac tics, we can expect people to change their mind at the last minute, feel entranced in the voti ng booth, vote for people other than they intended, and other interesting reports. We can expect irregular ities because the lengths people will go to elect O bama to be unusual, as that desire will supercede some peop le’s interest in democracy. We can expect signific ant voter fraud, and other problems. We have already s een such strange behavior, including many instanced of voter fraud, people bending the rules as if Obama w inning is more important than the rule, the obvious ly biased positions of most journalists, and reports t hat a respected journalist Gwen Ifill, who is moder ating a debate, who may not have properly disclosed that sh e is writing a book on Obama, which should have bee n done even to avoid the appearance of impropriety. Obama’s perceived greatness Bill Richardson called him the “greatest leader of a generation.” Nancy Pelosi called Obama “a leader that g-d has bl essed us with at this time.” Millions of people are worshipping a man who has ac complished virtually nothing but given speeches. Obama is drawing crowds like only John F. Kennedy c ould, except John F. Kennedy was in the military as commander of a torpedo boat, a congressman for six years, a senator for seven years, won the Pulitzer Prize, and was President of the United States before he ha d such support. Obama now is practically more popu lar than John F.

The McCain web ads “Love”, as w ell as “The Road To Denver” have examples of how people are spellbound by Obama 174 , including media persons. Journalists admit how s wept away they are, how they have a crush on Obama like they haven ’t had since grade school, and feel sensations goin g through their bodies while listening to him. 175 Journalists admit “its hard to remain objective,” describing the sensations running up their legs as they listen to him speak. “I feel a need to do this, I have t o” one Obama supporter says. “Regarding the “turn the page” speech, one typical supporter comments online: “I was there - i heard, i saw, i witnessed what i h ad been hearing only over the media.

His only message is \"I offer hope\" followed by \"tru st me\". He offers no plan for change and becomes annoyed when asked directly for details (he ar his interview with Steve Inskeep on NPR 1/9/08). He depends on young voters who- apparently - do not realize he stands for nothing.” 181 One blogger on HuffingtonPost.com writes: “Like 'vsign' I actually started out liking Obama a nd thinking that he had a chance to make a difference. After listening to him and reading abou t what he proposes to do as president, I no longer trust him. It's a pity that so many people seem to be in a trance and believe that he is some kind of a god.

To many who see through it, it is a quite creepy. Not only because his image does no t match his complete lack of accomplishments, and complete failure to bring any real change in his 46 years. People who follow Obama with sparkles in t heir eyes try to bring you into what is a very intense a nd frightening cult-like following – a childish tra nce-like religious experience wherein you give up all resist ance and submit to Obama love and it fulfills you completely 184 There are significant reports of even high level political people breaking rules to support Obama. One narrator of a criticism of Obama suppor ters’ improper voting tactics describes Obama followers as simply not being able to see through i t. The first question that no one really wants to exam ine, that we must examine, is, what is the logical explanation for the Obama phenomenon? As logical h uman beings, everything has a logical explanation. The media writes it off as “he is simply very charm ing and a great orator.” Does that suffice? His popularity is historic already. Historically, with some of the horrible leaders who have come to powe r through their guile, can we presume such cannot hap pen in this case just because this is America, and not even examine this phenomenon? Perhaps the best way to know Obama’s hypnosis techn iques are having an effect is because he is continu ing to use them. If these techniques weren’t working, he wouldn’t continue to risk his entire political c areer. The effects of Obama’s hypnosis on young people, an d more educated people The effect Obama is clearly having on younger peopl e is undeniable, and common knowledge that young people are one of his primary bases of support. Po lls, colleges and the internet are flooded with you ng people raving about Obama. Obama also apparently h as an increased effect on people who read more, or are more intellectual. In a recent article in New sweek Magazine entitled, “Letter to the Obama Generation”, author Jonathan Darman advises “cut th e blind devotion.” In hypnosis science terms, this is not surprising, as young people are known in psychology to respond better to hypnosis. 185 The critical factor is something that one is not born with, but is something developed through life experiences. 186 Dr. Erickson’s said of younger people’s susceptib ility to hypnosis: These two case reports have been presented in consi derable detail to illustrate the naturalistic hypnotic approach to children. There is seldom, if ever, a need for formalized or ritualistic technique. The eidetic imagery of a child, his rea diness, eagerness and actual need for new learnings, his desire to understand and to share in activities of the world about him, and the   183 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTp_atr2G9E&feature= user 184 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqe-JPLKfw&feature= PlayList&p=D2DE4AD0F81298F1&index=0&playnext=1 185 Young people often respond better to hypnosis than adults, and have the imagination necessary to make the process work well. http://www.morpheusclinic.com/content/frequently-as ked-questions 186 Killer Influence Secrets of Covert Hypnosis, by Da vid X, Part 1"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 64 opportunities offered by “pretend” and imitation ga mes all serve to enable him to respond competently and well to hypnotic suggestions. 187 Also discussed on the radio program with Dr. Will Horton cited above, was how young people under thir ty don’t have reference base to compare information wi th, and Obama is easily able to implant suggestions that are unchallenged in people without developed life e xperiences because they have nothing to draw from t o compare and contrast such absolute truths with. Yo unger people do not have prior experience with whic h to compare such compelling speech. As adults, many of us have heard at some point very compelling speech , and know it does not mean that anywhere near the cl aimed results will follow. Younger people are more subject to the influence of hypnosis generally. The period from age 14 to age 21 is the best period for both speed of induction and depth of hypnosis. 188 After age 20 there is a gradual decline. Younger people, and people with more inte llectual minds, like readers, are also more subject to the influence of hypnosis techniques that work by distr acting the conscious mind in order to access the subconscious, non-dominant hemisphere. 189 This is because the processing part of the mind i n these people will be more proactive in trying to solve the probl ems and chasing the distractions thrown by the hypn otist, as intended, leaving the subconscious more vulnerab le to implanting of suggestion. Same with younger people being more creative, for similar reasons. Younger people have a general need to believe. You nger people have internally a need to be imaginativ e, to do something different, to change the world, by the ir nature. They have a compelling internal drive t o be part of something, and in a way, do something diffe rent to make the world a better place. Obama makes very effective use of this about young people. How ever, just because Obama passionately shouts, “its time for change, new energy, and new ideas”, does not me an he really has any new ideas. Unfortunately, in helping young people understand that they are being unduly influenced, they may not want to believe it just like many adults will not. Perhaps those people no t convinced by this document can explain who Obama sat in Rev. Wright’s church for 20 years but did not kn ow Wright’s racist and anti-American views. You ca n never get a hypnotist to admit he is wrong. When y ou ask him how he didn’t know Wright’s views, he sa ys he knew some of them but there were also positive t hings about the guy. When you ask him how he staye d in the church, he says he didn’t hear these particu lar statements. Obama has played this dance succes sfully with every journalist until they gave up and moved on. Conclusion and commentary Obama is beguiling us. He is hypnotizing us like s heep. Fooling us like children. The Obama phenome non is essentially idol worship, caused by the well-stu died and well-rehearsed mind control tricks of a ma n who is very clever, able to play the media, and thinks he has the right take the Presidency of the United States through such deceptive means. He takes it upon him self to decide he has the right to do so, and manip ulate us without our knowledge by sidelining our rational judgment. What does such a person think of Americans?   187 Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H.

Jews voting for the candidate endorsed by Iran, Hamas, Farakhan, and Khalidi shou ld be a wake up signal that something is not Kosher . Obama could not have picked a worse list of support ers than Wright, Ayers, the Black Panther Party, Farakhan, Iran, Hamas, Khalidi, Rezko if he were th e Anti-Christ himself. This unknown man is trying to gain control of the world’s largest nuclear weapons arsenal by knowingly and intentionally using a for m of hypnosis on America that is the most deceptive and manipulative form of communication known to man. We are being played like a violin by someone very s mooth, who knows he can just play his games dodging questions and avoiding issues until the election. This document barely scratches the surface of his u se of hypnosis. He knows he can promise anything. If qu estioned with skepticism, he downplays. Then, he g oes right back to promising everything again. He can t ake neutral positions covering himself both ways, because what he is doing is never analyzed closely enough. He easily makes audiences feel like he has answered a question without having done so, simply by saying he has. If caught with evidence of his hypnosis, first, he will surely deny it. He will p robably stop doing it. If it is prove, he will adm it it, but say it is not his fault. Then, he may say that all adv ertising is part subliminal, and that everyone does it. Nobody has ever tried to gain the Presidency like t his. It literally doesn’t matter what he says, bec ause the conscious mind cannot override the subconscious, an d he knows that. Obama is an eloquent speaker, and very clever, but the rest is hypnosis. He is able to tell us exactl y what the polls say, exactly what he knows we want to hea r. – even if he has to change positions from one d ay to the next. 190 He knows exactly how to manipulate us. And he is false. Obama’s use of hypnosis and mind games gets you to make a different decision than yo u logically would have, yet he makes you feel like you came to that decision on your own rational reasonin g. our own feelings are false. If a person is willing to be this deceptive and smi le as broadly as Obama smiles, there is not telling what else he may be lying about, and no telling even who he really is. One must wonder why someone would risk their entire political career, so certain that if America was given another four years to find ou t who Obama really is, that we would never elect him, and that he must get the Presidency now, or never. Th is is a man we know nothing about, except that he has no vi rtually accomplishments, many shady connections, an d lacks the judgment and character to disassociate su ch persons, and is an influential orator. We as Ame ricans have to be stronger than to be influenced by words alone, even such powerful ones. The speaking style of frowning and angrily pointing while speaking angril y as part of covert hypnosis in public speeches is not used by Obama alone, but also was used by at least one other hypnotist in history who got millions to follow him. 191 192 193   190 Jackie Mason on Obama’s change in every major posi tion, See amazing video of Obama at 4:40 changing h is position on Iran at http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=41692003533 3614716&ei=uffkSIHzBZjUqAOqg- GZCw&q=jackie+mason+obama+iran&vt=lf . 191 http://www.theblackvault.com/article-print-8227.htm l . See also, “He also maintained his almost hypnot ic power over his entourage and the masses” http://www.grolier.com/wwii/wwii_hitler.html Also, One of the books Hitler is believed to hav e been particularly interested in was the work of the French psychologist Gustave Le Bon. Le Bon (1841-1 931), had written a book entitled Psychology of the Masses. It had been tran slated into German in 1908, and records show a copy was delivered to the library frequented by Hitler that same year. Le Bo n's book describes his theories on crowds and their behaviour. He had identified that group behaviour could be manipulate d by hypnotic suggestion, and that few individuals in a crowd possess a sufficiently strong personality to resist such sugg estion. http://ezinearticles.com/?Inspiration,-Motivation-a nd-the-Link-to- Hypnosis---Article-Five&id=988173"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 66 Obama is even taking away your ability to rationall y judge and scrutinize what he is putting into your subconscious. One must wonder the true nature of a person who is willing to literally hypnotize us li ke children, in order to try and manipulate us into vo ting for him by sidelining our rational judgment. Obama is effectively saying, “the voter cannot be trusted to make this a logical decision, I will decide for them.” This is a frightening character trait suggestive of someone who almost believes he is some type of Mes siah. Obama’s hyper-confidence alone is frightening. He is neither simply confident nor overconfident nor e ven simply arrogant. Obama’s aura almost suggests he b elieves himself to be Messianic, and his right to t he Presidency long overdue and unquestionable. Not to mention his right to hypnotize millions to get tha t Presidency absolute. There was a moment during the Clinton primaries, where Bill Clinton made some strong statements against Obama, and Obama’s reacti on to the former President was clearly one of being annoyed. It is questionable what type of psycholog ical g-d complex or other abnormality would make Obama look down upon a former President as annoying . Obama’s insulting hand gestures provide more insigh t into his disturbing true nature that he successfu lly hides 99% of the time, that of someone who uses psy chologically manipulative subconscious techniques t o implant second-grade school-yard insults in the min ds of unaware voters. Obama’s use of hypnosis on millions of people without our knowledge nor permis sion is unparalleled subterfuge. What kind of pers on presumes that they have the right to hypnotize Amer icans like children, and use mind control technique s which circumvent our rational judgment? But even m ore amazingly, what type of person runs for Preside nt of the United States with such behavior? - repeated ly flashing such insulting hand gestures at his opp onents, trying to send subconscious messages? It is beyond obnoxious. Only a disturbed individual would thin k he is slippery enough to get away with something like this. Only a disturbed person would think they sho uld get away with something like this, and with no acco mplishments having never run anything become leader of the free world. Only a disturbed individual who thinks he can do absolutely anything would try, be cause to any sane person running for President, the risks of being caught would outweigh the potential rewar ds of such behavior. The hypnosis, trying to fool an ent ire nation, the obscene hand gestures towards his opponents again and again. Obama’s actions present the frightening picture of a genuinely perverted m an, an egomaniac hypnotist with a g-d complex grown fro m his ability to get millions to eat out of his han d. The fact that he refers to his own message as a lig ht shining down from above. The fact that he refer s to himself as an epiphany. The fact that he does hand gestures to make it look like he is parting the wa ter like Moses. The fact that he does all those other thing s to make people like Nancy Pelosi come out and say he is ‘sent by g-d.” \u0001\u0001 One must also wonder what would happen to this coun try if Obama won, and only afterwards was it uncovered how he used hypnosis to gain the Presiden cy. What if upon discovery, many said they would n ot have voted for him otherwise? Those entrusted with protecting our democracy must do a better job protecting it. Our entire nation was almost lost t o a con-man. The media may avoid this story for a number of reas ons. Maybe it is too complicated for them, doesn’t fit a sound byte mold, or maybe cannot be delivered in a 60 second news story before moving on. Then again, it may be the most watched news story from now until t he election. This story must break. People must k now what is happening and those who help spread this wo rd may be looked back on as heroic defenders of democracy. Let’s learn from history, not learn tha t we can repeat it. Our democracy is on the line.        192 Compare the angry frowning and angry pointing and speaking style of Obama http://www.mikefrancesa.com/wordpress/?p=1011 193 Compare the angry frowning and angry pointing and speaking style of Obama 18:00minutes into his Calif ornia Democratic National Convention speech with the individual on t his video http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=- 211746012802428229&ei=h-PESJCLBqfcqAO3s5S3BQ&q=adol ph+hitler+speech+1933&vt=lf"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF OBAMA’S USE OF HIDDEN HYPNOSIS TE CHNIQUES IN HIS SPEECHES EXPOSING OBAMA’S DECEPTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO P ROTECT DEMOCRACY 67 The effects of his hypnosis must be cancelled out b y people starting to take a rational look at who he is, including the media. It is certainly a concern tha t this type of hypnosis is so effective that even a fter learning what Obama is doing, many may still not be lieve and accept that Obama is hypnotizing them and that they might not otherwise vote for him. 194 It is my hope that the effects of all of Obama’s hypnotic and subconscious tactics are wiped away and neutralized completely...that everyone now be allowed to think and make logical and rational decisions. \u0001 \u0001 \u0003 \u0000 \u0004 \u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0003 \u0000\u0001 \u0001 Personal Notes: Mr. Obama, Your attempt to gain the Presidency of the United S tates by hypnotizing Americans has failed. You shall not pass! You have been stopped, because you nether deserve the Presidency, nor does America deserve your fraud and deception. It is quite clear that, after Americans find out who you really are, including your use of hypnosis, you will never have even a remote chance at the Presidency again. You have been stopped becaus e your deception has been found out. You were a master of influence, able to influence milli ons. You were impervious to scrutiny that could easily eliminate any other candidate. However, exp osing your use of hypnosis is what shatters all of your other deceptions. You have been stopped by one anonymous patriot with a pure heart who is able to see you for who you really are. The re are those more powerful than you, Obama, looking out for truth, justice, and the American wa y. As the words of my favorite song go, “Sinnerman, where you gonna run to?” Dear Friends, Thank you to all who have helped communicate this m essage, including by sending it to friends and posting it on websites in its entirety, so that everyone could judge and understand for themselves the real “Obama phenomenon.” I would al so like to thank all the psychologists, hypnotists, and other experts who come out and help confirm the substance of this document. You are all part of this victory over deception, an d for democracy.   194 “The unconscious mind is the source of our energy.
