For one thing, he was wearing slippers. Expensive, embroidered,monogrammed slippers. But slippers all the same.For another, he was accompanied by two attractive women. Even in Manhattan, anisland that attracts beautiful women from all over the world, these women stoodout.As the man half shuffled, half walked down the avenue, the women walked slightlybehind him, as if they were attendants or staff.Tim followed, keeping a respectable distance, as the threesome made a right onto71st Street and headed toward an enormous town house—a house that was almost afortress—right in the middle of the block. The imposing residence had a stonefacade and a fifteen-foot-high front door that wouldn’t have looked out of placeprotecting a castle. And, like our neighbor’s slippers, the house had amonogram: raised brass letters that spelled out JE.The house and, quite possibly, the two women belonged to Jeffrey Epstein, a richand powerful man who was also a registered sex offender with a strong taste forunderage women.Not just sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds. But younger girls as well.Epstein was alleged to have abused dozens of young women, or, more accurately,girls. He’d settled potential lawsuits with some of them. He’d done a bit ofprison time for his crimes. A bit of time. And now here he was, out in the worldagain.Accompanied by two beautiful young women.I had been hearing hair-raising stories about Jeffrey Epstein for a couple ofyears. Our interests could not have been more different, but Palm Beach, wherewe both live, is small and tightly knit, and we knew some of the same people.Epstein’s arrest had made headlines in papers all over the world. But in PalmBeach, it caused a scandal that continues to set off aftershocks and leave a badsmell.So I had followed Epstein’s case in the media and talked about it over dinnerswith friends. I wondered why it had taken so long for the Palm Beach police tocatch up with Epstein. And, once they did, why he had served so little jailtime.Those were the obvious questions, but there were others: How had Epstein madehis money, possibly billions? No one seemed to know. And while the news mediahad some details about the underage girls, reporters seemed only to know whathad happened at the moment of his arrest.Epstein definitely liked his massages. He got them from two, even three, youngwomen a day, right in his mansion on the island. He’d been operating on analmost industrial scale. But who were these girls? Where had they come from? Howdid they find their way to his home on a secluded street in Palm Beach?Epstein had powerful friends. He’d flown Bill Clinton around in his private jetand rubbed shoulders with heads of state, Nobel Prize winners, any number ofbillionaires. Prince Andrew, the man sixth in line to the British throne, hadbeen a close friend.Were any of these connections the reason that Epstein was now a free man?I wanted to know. After all, our homes were a half mile apart, and Epstein’sactions had had an undeniable impact on the town where I lived. Stirred by thatsighting of Epstein up in New York, Tim Malloy and I began to investigate.We partnered with John Connolly, a tough, no-nonsense journalist who had oncebeen a cop with the NYPD and had been following the Epstein story for close toten years.Working together, we interviewed Epstein’s friends, going all the way back tohis childhood; we met with Epstein’s acquaintances, employees, neighbors, andbusiness associates, and finally with the families of his victims. Weinterviewed law enforcement officers who’d worked on the investigation in PalmBeach and lawyers on all sides of the resulting court cases, some of which arestill working their way through the court system.Combining our interview material with evidence obtained from court filings andother investigations, such as the one conducted by Connolly’s Vanity Faircolleague Vicky Ward, we began to put the pieces together.In a few instances, we have re-created brief scenes and snatches of dialogue.These are based on interviews, police investigation documents, and courtfilings. We changed the names and identities of the girls, hoping to protectthem from more embarrassment and harm.There never was any doubt that Jeffrey Epstein was guilty. He admitted as muchin the non-prosecution agreement he agreed to sign in 2007. The question is,what exactly was he guilty of?This book attempts to answer that question and many others about this strangeand mysterious man. These days people all around the world are angry about andsuspicious of the super rich and powerful. The story of Jeffrey Epstein is anobject lesson about why we ought to be. To put it simply, some people think theycan operate outside the law. And that’s what they do.—James Patterson, Palm Beach, February 20, 2016"},{"pageContent":"PART I [part0123.xhtml#toc-part001]THE CRIME [part0123.xhtml#toc-part001]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter001]Mary: February 2005It’s a typically slow South Florida Sunday, and Mary’s staring into the mirror,trying to wipe the morning cobwebs away from her dark, sleepy eyes.She’s a pretty girl, tiny—just five feet three inches tall—but tanned andathletic, with curly black henna-streaked hair.* [part0121.xhtml#Footnote_66067]Her bedroom’s a playland of pinks and pastels, stuffed animals, and boy-bandposters. But Mary’s a teenager now. Fourteen years old. She even has aboyfriend. He’s cute and popular. Joe† [part0121.xhtml#Footnote_66070] is theheartthrob of her school, and Mary’s feelings for him are new to her, powerful,hard to untangle. She’s thinking of Joe as she presses the Play button on heriPod.The MP3 player’s on shuffle. There’s no telling what song will come up, andMary’s head drops dramatically in anticipation. Then a loud, sexy throb spillsout of the earbuds: Britney Spears. The bass line takes over, and she starts todance, moving her hips as she lip-synchs the lyrics:With a taste of a poison paradise…Mary’s swept away by the song. She’s twirling around and around, flinging herarms out to grab the clothes hanging up in her closet—it’s like embracing tenthousand fans! Then she stops and pulls out the earbuds. Suddenly she’s becomefourteen again. Just a girl, jittery, nervous.What she’s thinking about now is what she will wear to the big fancy house.Mary desperately wants to make an impression. This will be her first trip to thehouse. She does not want to look like a child on this outing.She picks out a pair of skinny white jeans, puts on a freshly washed halter topthat leaves her flat stomach bare. The cross that Joe gave her last Christmashangs from her neck.Think of the money, she thinks.For Mary, it’s incredible money. Several weeks’ wages at Mickey D’s. And justfor giving some old man a massage? She twists the earbuds back in, dives intothe closet, sings along with Britney Spears:Don’t you know that you’re toxic?The tight white jeans fit Mary perfectly. She turns to check herself out in themirror, cropping the scene with her fingers to block out the Barbies behind her.Over on the Gold Coast, girls in big, high-ceilinged bedrooms have American Girldolls. Dolls with natural smiles, perfectly vacant moon faces. American Girldolls are beautiful. They’re expensive. But you have to have one if Mom and Dadare willing to pay. Over on the Coast, most mothers and fathers are. But out inthe sticks, where Mary lives, you get Barbies—passed down from mother todaughter, from sister to sister. They’re rail-thin, missile-breasted. There’s atouch of knowingness to the curl of their otherwise innocent mouths. AmericanGirl dolls are girlie, but Barbie’s like Britney Spears. Barbie’s dangling herlong legs over the line that separates girls from women.Be like Barbie, Mary thinks.She can’t be nervous. Not now. Not today.What she tells herself, over and over again, is: It’s not that big a deal.But, of course, it is a big deal. Before long, Mary’s visit to the big fancyhouse will become part of a months-long Palm Beach police investigation—anaffidavit for probable cause, filed by the Palm Beach PD—and, finally, thearrest and conviction of the home’s owner, Jeffrey Epstein."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter002]Jeffrey Epstein: February 2005Jeffrey’s morning routine is precise and unvarying. First he spends twenty-fiveminutes in silence, visualizing the day ahead as he digests the guava, banana,and Müeslix that his chef prepares for him—the same way every day—at six in themorning. Then Jeffrey walks a third of a mile up to South County Road, pausingonce in a while to take deep, restorative breaths.It’s a slight slope that leads toward the ocean. Jeffrey’s home on theIntracoastal Waterway is behind him now. The morning’s not windy. The Atlanticis calm and glittery, and fishing trawlers bob gently on distant waves.Jeffrey’s partial to monogrammed sweatpants, monogrammed fleece pullovers, andhoodies. Casual attire offset by embroidered Stubbs & Wootton slippers—the kindthat sell for hundreds of dollars a pair. His hair, which is thick, has turnedsilver. But Jeffrey Epstein does not have a paunch. For a fifty-two-year-oldman, he’s extremely fit. Six feet tall, 180 pounds, brown eyes, a strongjawline.He’s never been a drinker. He doesn’t smoke or take drugs, and he takes caregood care of his body as well as his mind.It’s a magnificent mind. His gift is for numbers: complex calculations, abstractformulas. Even as a child, Jeffrey could untangle math problems that would stumpmost smart adults. Numbers just fall into place for him, forming in ranks he canbend, twist, manipulate—and multiply. He could have been a scientist or amathematician. As a young man, he taught calculus and physics. Then he became aninvestor—a very rich man. Then he became a philanthropist, like Bill Gates. Hislove for science has inspired him to give millions to academics and institutionscommitted to studying mysteries of the brain and the arcana of physics. He’sgiven millions to Harvard. And he’s given money to politicians: Governor EliotSpitzer, of New York, and Governor Bill Richardson, of New Mexico, where Epsteinowns the largest home in the state.Epstein’s flown Bill Clinton to Africa on a private jet—not the Gulfstream heowns but his Boeing 727, customized with its own trading floor—so that theformer president could promote his various and worthy causes.Just for fun, Chris Tucker, the comedian, and Clinton’s pal Kevin Spacey hadtagged along for the ride.“Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropistwith a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge oftwenty-first-century science,” Clinton would say through a spokesperson. “Iespecially appreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip toAfrica to work on democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service, andcombating HIV/AIDS.”But is Jeffrey thinking about that trip now?His first guest is due that morning at nine, and that leaves him enough time fora shower, a lunch, and a few phone calls before the second girl arrives.Sarah has scheduled that girl for one.For Jeffrey, it’s just part of the daily routine.But on this day, there’s a delicious twist.One of the girls is a first-timer."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter001]Mary: February 2005Downstairs, the doorbell is ringing. Mary’s father shouts, gruffly:“Ella está aquí. Su amiga con el camión.”“She’s here. Your friend with the truck.”Mary runs down the stairs. It’s game day, and Dad’s already got the TV on. Herstepmom’s out running errands. Mary’s twin sister has gone out, too,Rollerblading with a few of her friends.“Going shopping,” she yells, and she pops a piece of Dubble Bubble into hermouth.“¿Dice quién?”“Says who?”Mary’s already halfway out the door. Her father calls out again, but on Sundaysthere’s no getting him out of his chair. Besides, Mary knows he’ll be happy whenhe sees the money she’s made. Real money, like Joe’s cousin Wendy Dobbs, ismaking.* [part0121.xhtml#Footnote_66072] And it’s not like she’s running off todo something crazy. After all, Wendy’s assured her already that there’s nothingto worry about.Mary’s father is Cuban—an immigrant—a self-made man who runs a contractingbusiness. He’s wise to the ways of the world and highly protective of his twodaughters. They’re good girls, he knows. Almost angels. As far as he knows, theydon’t drink. They’ve never tried drugs. They love clothes and, especially,music—Britney Spears, Nelly Furtado, Maroon 5, the boy band with that dreamylead singer. Mary loves California, which she’s never seen but daydreams about.She just knows she’ll live there someday—a plan that’s okay with her father aslong as Mary keeps up with her homework and chores.What he worries about, in the meantime, is the crowd that Mary runs with.Joe is a fine boy. More responsible than most American boys his age. But Joe’scousin, Wendy, is another story. Mary’s father doesn’t like Wendy at all andwould have liked her even less had he known about Wendy’s intentions.In just one hour, Wendy’s told Mary, she can make more money than her fathermakes in a day: “This guy in Palm Beach. He’s rich. Very rich. He has anairplane. He owns an island, you know?”Like a lot of kids who live inland, away from the Florida coast, Mary’s dreamsreach way beyond the dull, scrubby flatlands and strip malls she’s grown uparound. There’s so much that she wants to do and see. But for her the GoldCoast, twenty miles away, might as well be another country.“Yes,” she had said, without even thinking about it.Then there was Joe to contend with.“Who is this guy?” Joe had said, shaking his head. “You don’t know a thing abouthim.”“Hundreds of dollars,” Mary had whispered. She couldn’t quite look at Joe, butshe was firm: “I can make that in one hour.”Joe seemed to think they were actually talking about it. A conversation—someback-and-forth. But the thought of not going hadn’t even crossed Mary’s mind. Ifanything, she hoped that it would become a regular thing.“To rub his feet? Are you kidding? If you’re not worried about it, why haven’tyou told your dad?”“It’s your cousin, Joe! Some girls go three times a week.”“The guy’s feet must be killing him.”“Shut up!”“Tell your father.”“You know how Dad is. You don’t tell your parents everything.”“I’m not going to some freak’s mansion to rub his feet.”“That’s right. I am.”“And if I told your father? Or mine?”“You’d never see me again.”Mary felt bad as she said it. She felt bad for lying.She knew that it would be more than a foot rub.Wendy had told her that much, at least."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter004]Jeffrey Epstein: February 2005John Kluge, the media magnate, has bought up several lots around here, torn downthe mansions, and built a grand, sprawling estate. But Epstein’s neighbors haveblocked his own efforts to buy more land and increase his holdings.Epstein’s address in Palm Beach is 358 El Brillo Way. Built in the fifties by atotally run-of-the-mill architect, the house has none of the elegance of hisneighbors’ homes. It’s big, with a big swimming pool—that’s the most you can sayfor it. It’s totally bland. But it’s the last house on a dead-end block, thelast block of the street, and this makes it very secluded.Tonight, one of Epstein’s black Escalades will whisk him away, taking him to theprivate terminal at Palm Beach International Airport. Then a short flight downto Little Saint James—or, as he likes to call it, Little Saint Jeff’s—theseventy-eight-acre island he owns in the Virgin Islands. But for the moment,there are still things to attend to in Florida. Business and pleasure—although,in Epstein’s experience, the two have always fit together nicely.He strolls through the gate, past the guard, up to the side door that leads tothe kitchen. Inside, he ignores the maid doing dishes and climbs a wide, windingstaircase to the second floor. He walks down a hallway, one that’s lined withphotographs of naked women. Then, in his bedroom, he opens a closet. Inside,there are many more photographs. Erotic photos, tacked to the wall, of girls whohave come to the house.Familiar faces, familiar bodies. That’s what makes the first-timers so special.Epstein checks his watch before closing the door.The Virgin Islands can wait."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter005]Mary: February 2005The Dubble Bubble’s lost all its flavor, but Mary’s still chewing the gum as sheshifts, nervously, in the backseat of Wendy’s big pickup truck. The girl sittingup front next to Wendy is a stranger to Mary. She’s chain-smoking menthols. Themusic is blaring; the seat is filthy and gross. Worried that her white jeanswill get grody, Mary sits on her hands. Then, through the window, she sees agigantic resort called the Breakers. It is resplendent, sun-drenched, not quitereal—like something you’d see in the movies.It makes for an interesting contrast.“We’ll wait for her,” Wendy says to the girl in the passenger seat. “Then we canall go to the mall.”“Which one?”“The Gardens.”It’s like she’s not there. Mary wants to say something about it, but she doesn’tknow if the other girls would even respond. Wendy’s always seemed so much coolerthan kids Mary’s age. This other girl’s just a mystery. And when Wendy does turnaround to speak to Mary, her stare seems to slice right through the youngergirl.“Remember,” Wendy says, according to a probable cause affidavit filed by thePalm Beach police. “When he asks how old you are, say eighteen.”The light changes, and Wendy turns back around but keeps looking at Mary in therearview mirror.“Got it?”Mary nods.“I mean it,” says Wendy.Who would believe her? Anyone can see that Mary is younger than that.“Okay,” she says. “I got it. Eighteen.”Mary takes out her flip phone and sends Joe a text: “Your cousin is a BAMF.”A badass motherfucker.There’s no reply.“Or maybe she’s just a bitch,” Mary texts.Still no reply.Joe must still be in church, Mary thinks.They pass El Bravo Way and turn onto El Brillo Way.Wendy’s driving slowly now, right at the speed limit. Once more, she says: “Whenthe man asks your age, say eighteen.”Mary nods again and smiles, slightly. She wants Wendy to see her smiling. Toknow that she’s got it all under control. But Wendy’s eyes are on the front gatenow. It opens, she parks, and they walk past a guard.“We’re here to see Jeff,” says Wendy.The guard nods—of course you are—and leads them to the side door.They’re in the kitchen now. Mary, Wendy, some middle-aged man. The man has along face, bushy eyebrows, and thick silver hair—and he’s fit. As fit as thejocks that Mary goes to school with. Not attractive, exactly. He’s way too oldfor that. But confident, in a way that makes an impression.Standing behind the man there’s a woman. She’s blond, very pretty, much tallerthan Wendy.What a strange scene, Mary thinks. She can’t shake the feeling that the man isstudying her. Then he nods, and he and Wendy walk out of the kitchen. A littlewhile later, they’re back.“Sarah,” the man says to the tall woman. “You can take Mary upstairs.”Sarah takes Mary up a wide winding staircase carpeted in pink. Together theywalk down a hall that’s got photographs on the wall—naked women. Long curtainscover windows and don’t let in much light. In the air, there’s a strong lavenderfragrance.Then they come to a room containing a green-and-pink sofa. There’s a largebathroom off to one side and doors on either side of the sofa. There’s a woodenarmoire with sex toys on it. There’s a massage table, too, and a mural of anaked woman.“Wait here,” says Sarah. “Jeff will be up in a moment.”Mary’s too freaked out to do anything else. Fidgeting with her belt loops, shesits on the sofa, jumps up again.Then she sees the picture.All the girls in the photos are young. But the girl in this one’s just a baby.Much younger than Mary herself.The girl’s smiling, but the smile’s mixed with something else—some sort ofanxiety that’s out of place on such a small face. And what she’s doing isshocking: pulling her underwear off to the side. Flashing one of her tinyapple-round butt cheeks toward the camera.Mary gasps. She turns around. And there’s Epstein standing in front of her,wearing nothing but a towel."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter006]Michael Reiter: March 2005Chief Reiter looks more like a bank president than a cop. He’s well built, withan air of formality and discretion. But he’s got twenty-four years on the job.Decades earlier, he was a campus police officer in Pittsburgh. Then he rose,steadily, through the ranks in Palm Beach, moving up from patrol officer todetective, working vice, narcotics, and organized crime, then becoming asergeant, captain, major, and assistant chief—a job he held for threeyears—before becoming chief of police. Reiter is what you’d call seasoned,although chief of police in Palm Beach is a job that calls upon his politicalskills as much as his street smarts.Then again, from time to time, things do happen.Once in a blue moon there are murders—though these are so rare that they tend tobe remembered for decades.Sometimes there are hurricanes to contend with, and, when the sea calms, humancargo washes up on the shore. Sometimes traffickers aim the bows of their boatsat the glow of the Breakers resort, order their passengers to go overboard, thentell them to swim.Most of the passengers are Haitian—men, women, and children who stake all theyhave on a chance at a life in America. From time to time, Palm Beach cops haveto retrieve their bodies from the surf.Things get busier during the wintertime, or, as the locals call it, the season.It’s when the very rich come to town, throw parties and balls, shop, and tangletraffic at the intersections around Worth Avenue. The population booms, and themen and women who work under Chief Reiter deal with fender benders, shoplifters,and snotty skateboarding teenagers. There are DUIs. Domestic disturbances.Choking victims and heart attacks. It’s routine stuff, but there’s always lotsof it. Enough to keep the men and women who work for Reiter busy.Chief Reiter’s proud of the team he has built. And, the team knows, they’relucky to have him. Reiter’s extremely well qualified for the job. If anything,he’s overqualified, with a certificate from the John F. Kennedy School ofGovernment at Harvard and antiterrorist training at Quantico, courtesy of theFBI. It’s not brought up often at cocktail parties in Palm Beach, but several ofthe 9/11 hijackers lived in Palm Beach County. They took flight lessons at localairstrips. A few, including the mastermind, Mohamed Atta, had been regulars at251 Sunrise, a chic nightclub in Palm Beach. There they had regaled any womanwho would listen with made-up stories about their adventures as pilots.But 251 Sunrise is shuttered now. The joint was shut down in 2004, after anavalanche of noise complaints. For the moment, Palm Beach is as quiet and calmas any place Reiter has dreamed about.For the moment."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter007]Mary: March 2005If there’s no traffic, Mary’s hometown is less than thirty minutes away from theisland of Palm Beach. But in economic terms it’s a world away. Her high schoolis run by the county. Most of Mary’s classmates are black. Thirty percent areHispanic, as she is. The rest are white. The school has a C rating, and lots ofstudents receive free or discounted lunches. Mary is one of those students. Butinch by inch, she’s working her way out of the crab barrel. A good kid, herteachers think. A kid with a future in front of her.Weeks have gone by since her meeting with Epstein. She hasn’t told anyone aboutthe visit. Still, other kids at the high school have noticed a change.“Yo, Mary,” a friend says. “What’s up with you anyway?”This is a kid who veers from nice to mean, depending on who else is around.Still, a friend.“Nothing,” says Mary.“You got your period?”“Shut the fuck up,” Mary whispers.There have been rumors going around, she knows that. Rumors started by a girlwho has eyes for Joe.“Whore,” her rival shouts in the hallway one day.“You’re the whore,” Mary shouts back.Mary rushes the girl, who shoves back, grabbing at Mary’s hair, twisting andtugging. Someone yells, “Catfight!” By the time the bell rings for next period,Mary’s sitting in the principal’s office.She shakes her head in reply to the questions, stays silent, feeling humiliated.Then, in her wallet, they find the three hundred dollars.Mary’s too young and too small to be stripping. Besides, the bills are alltwenties, not singles or fives. When they call Mary’s parents, her teacherssuggest a more obvious explanation: Does Mary do drugs or deal them?Mary’s father knows better than that. “No,” he insists. A psychologist is calledin. And then, Mary does start talking.Once she does, she can’t stop.It’s a wild story. Highly disturbing. A mansion in Palm Beach. A powerful man.This is all far from the principal’s wheelhouse. It’s definitely a matter forthe police. In the meantime, the school’s recommending a transfer, purelytemporarily, to a facility for troubled kids—ones with “issues.”Mary’s a good girl, it’s true. But further confrontations at the high schoolwill not be tolerated."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter008]Michele Pagan: March 2005On March 15, Palm Beach police officer Michele Pagan takes the first call fromMary’s stepmother.“Ma’am,” she says, “I’m going to have to ask you to come down to the station.”“I don’t want to say anything more until I speak with my husband.”“Ma’am, I appreciate that. But I’d urge you to come in. Let us find out whathappened. Please.”“I’ll get back to you.”“Please, ma’am. I’m here for the rest of the day. We’re on South County Road.”At the station, Mary’s father does most of the talking.“There was an incident,” he says. “At school. A fight between Mary and anothergirl. But please understand, our Mary’s not like that.”Officer Pagan’s starting to feel as though she’s swimming in uncharted waters.She’s young, and the cases she’s worked before this have been minor. Robberies,that sort of thing. Pagan’s not used to the Gold Coast. She was educated in NewYork City, and, to her, the less affluent towns further in from the Coast mightas well be somewhere in Georgia. Then again, she knows enough to know that inthe back of the station, detectives are already whispering.What’s a guy with that kind of money need with some girl from out west? Thewomen around here could make a man cry.Extortion?The kid’s fourteen. What would she know from extortion?Have you seen the shows these kids watch? They know about things we’ve neverdreamed about.No, Pagan thinks. This is her case.She’s the one who’s going to work it."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter009]Mary: March 2005Mary’s father and stepmother believe their girl. Officer Pagan believes Mary’sparents. Ergo, Mary must be telling the truth. The girl’s got a sweet, high,halting voice. Pagan interviews her twice, and both times, she speaks with herchin buried deep in her chest.“Tell me, honey,” says Pagan. “What happened?”In her notepad, Michele Pagan writes: While speaking to me, Mary became upsetand started to cry.“This white-haired guy came into the room,” Mary says. “Wearing only a towelaround his waist. He took off the towel. And then he was all naked, and he laydown on a massage table.“He was a really built guy. But his wee-wee was very tiny.”Mary tells Pagan that Epstein spoke only to give her instructions, which he didin a stern voice. She tells Pagan that she was alone and didn’t know what to do.She removed her pants, leaving her thong panties on, Pagan writes in herincident report.She straddled his back, whereby her exposed buttocks were touching Epstein’sexposed buttocks.Epstein then turned to his side and started to rub his penis in an up-and-downmotion. Epstein pulled out a purple vibrator and began to massage Mary’s vaginalarea.Mary’s sure that Epstein ejaculated. “He used a towel to wipe himself down as hegot off the table,” she says.That week, Pagan’s assigned to the case, along with six detectives. Five men,two women. “A predator case,” one of them will say. “This is different fromsomeone who is stealing. This predator is a smart person, and that’s his desire.He can’t stop.”Within days, another victim comes into the station. She’s got a similar story.It’s a tricky case, according to a source closely involved with theinvestigation, because the girls involved are far too young to use as bait in anattempt to catch Epstein committing another crime—even if they were willing toplay along. Still, there are other strings that Chief Reiter’s team can startpulling.Two weeks later, on March 31, Officer Pagan has Mary make a controlled call toWendy Dobbs.The first attempt goes straight to voice mail.The next time Mary calls, Wendy picks up.On the recordings made by Officer Pagan, Mary’s voice is tiny and tentative,while Wendy sounds mature, gruff, fully grown, like the femme fatale in some oldblack-and-white movie.“Hey, what’s up?” she says impatiently.“Nothing,” says Mary.“I talked to Jeffrey, and I’m going to his house tomorrow morning,” says Wendy.“I’m going to set something up for you.”“Cool. Like, what do you think?”“I don’t know. I’m going to talk to him tomorrow morning when I go to his houseabout it.”“Um, how much would I get paid?”“Talk to him. I’ll talk to him tomorrow, and then I’ll bring you in the nextday. You can talk to him about it.”So far, so good, thinks Officer Pagan. But she needs more. She looks at Maryexpectantly, but not too expectantly, she hopes. She can imagine how hard itmust be for the girl. Or maybe she can’t imagine it at all. But either way, Maryseems to have gotten the message. Straightening up in her chair, she begins topress Wendy.“I don’t know,” Wendy says in response. “I don’t know. You’re going to have totalk to him about it. I mean, I don’t really work for him like that. I justbring girls to him and they work for him….You can ask him, like, ‘What can I doto make more money?’”Mary keeps pressing.“The more you do, the more you get paid,” Wendy says finally.“Want me to bring my sister for you? So that we can get paid more or something?”“Well, yeah. That’s what I’m saying. I’m working tomorrow, and me and him aregoing to put a schedule together for you and your sister. So I’ll call youtomorrow when I leave Jeffrey with a schedule.”“Okay, well, I don’t have a phone. So if you guys call me, I’d have to know whattime so I could get the phone.”“Okay. I’ll leave you a message. That’s fine. I’ll leave you a message.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter010]Noel St. Pierre: March 2005Noel St. Pierre* [part0121.xhtml#Footnote_66074] thinks of the kids he grew upwith in Haiti. His old neighborhood was pressed up against the jungle borderthat Haiti shares with the Dominican Republic, and some of the kids he knewwould slip over. Those kids would stay in the DR for a few days, sometimesweeks. Some of them never returned. But the ones who did come back wouldn’t saytoo much about it.Most of them didn’t talk much at all.By the time he was ten, Noel had learned the truth about those kids. He’dlearned that they’d ended up working as prostitutes.This was how Noel St. Pierre had learned about evil. There really were devilsout in the world. Flesh-and-blood devils, and they were nothing like the demonshe’d heard about in church. Noel had never forgotten the way those kids looked.The way they’d turned into old men and old women. They were like zombies trappedin children’s bodies. And now, in America, Noel’s been given a chance to helpother kids.That’s what the police have told him, at least.Noel is a sanitation worker. Still strong at fifty, and lucky enough to havefound his way to Palm Beach, he gets in to work before anyone else and keeps hiswhite compactor truck clean, almost glistening. His pickup route runs hot andcold with the seasons. But even in the summer, with much less to do, he’s on thejob early, braced for a six-hour shift that would break a lesser man’s back. Inthe winter, the job gets even harder. The Estate Section gets especially busy.Some of the parties have hundreds of guests. They leave behind mountains ofrefuse. That garbage gets picked up daily, or twice a day when requested. It’scarried by workers who slip, silently, under the porte cocheres. Then it getswhisked twenty miles away to a landfill that the garbagemen call MountTrashmore.Noel’s stretch of the Estate Section runs from the Everglades Club to thesouthernmost tip of the island. It encompasses Banyan Road, Jungle Road, ElBravo Way, and El Brillo Way. His performance record is spotless. As far as thePalm Beach PD is concerned, he’s the perfect man for the job.Chief Reiter’s authorized a “trash pull”—a legal way to collect discardedevidence. In this case, evidence culled from Jeffrey Epstein’s garbage. But whenthe police call him, Noel St. Pierre simply assumes that another refugee boathas run aground on the beach. A sad thing, but something that does happen fromtime to time. His homeland, Haiti, is desperately poor. Run by despots who linetheir pockets while everyday people suffer.Many of the refugees are illiterate.Most of them speak only Creole.“Eske ou ka ede nou, souple,” they ask.“Can you help us, please?”The cops always need a translator, and Noel’s been asked to help out before. Butthis time the police officer’s voice is raspy, impatient.“This time is different,” the officer says. “Something very special. You don’thave to accept. But if you do, you’ll have to keep things to yourself,completely.”When he hears what the story is, Noel accepts.“I’ll do it,” he says immediately.The address he’s been given is 358 El Brillo Way. On his first morning, St.Pierre moves swiftly, sneaking a glance through the kitchen window at the foursilhouettes standing inside. Three women, one of them quite short, withpigtails.The fourth silhouette is that of a tall man.The police have given him clear instructions. The work is unsavory, but so isthe work Noel does every day. What the detectives want from him now are slips ofpaper with phone numbers, along with toothbrushes, condoms, discarded underwear.Anything that could provide DNA. He’s been told to use a special truck on the ElBrillo run. Whatever he finds he’s to put aside in small trash bags he’lldeliver directly to the station at the end of every shift.Jeffrey Epstein’s garbage will never arrive at Mount Trashmore.As he drives to the police station, St. Pierre thinks about Epstein and whathe’s been told. It’s a wonder to him that American kids would do what the policesay these kids have done. American kids are rich, after all. Some of them justdon’t know it, he guesses.Americans always want more than they have.Then again, children do stupid things. They don’t know any better. And St.Pierre’s trips to the house make one thing clear. These girls are young. Reallyyoung.“I hope you can stop this man,” St. Pierre tells the cop.The detective shoots him a sharp look, and St. Pierre nods.“Please,” he says, more softly this time.“Can we count on seeing you here tomorrow?”The detective looks antsy, impatient again. In his hand he’s holding a scrap ofpaper that Noel St. Pierre has pulled from Epstein’s trash. Wendy Dobbs’s nameis on it. Mary’s name is on it as well.The detective can’t wait to get it to Chief Reiter’s office.“As long as it takes, sir,” St. Pierre tells him. “Tomorrow, the next day.Whenever you need me.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter011]Michael Reiter: September 2005There’s a sense in which the Palm Beach PD functions as a foundation. From timeto time, one of the town’s wealthy residents will walk in with a check followedby an inquiry. How much more would the police force need to make this remarkablysafe community feel even safer?A tax write-off? Sure. But why not? Coming from most, it’s a genuine gesture.One of appreciation for all they have and for all the department’s efforts toguard it. Donations are accepted graciously, gratefully. In 2004, the departmenthad taken one from Jeffrey Epstein—the second donation he’d made to the PalmBeach PD—for ninety thousand dollars. Generous, even by the generous standardsof Palm Beach. The donation, which Epstein delivered personally, was earmarkedfor a firearms training simulator. But that day Michael Reiter had thoughtsomething seemed off about Epstein.Something an old cop would notice.Reiter’s officers had told him about complaints they’d gotten a few monthsearlier—young women hanging around at the end of the block or coming and goingat all hours from Epstein’s house. “There was some follow-up to that,” Reitersaid in a deposition for B.B. vs. Epstein, a civil suit, brought by a victim,that Jeffrey eventually settled. “I think we may have encountered one or two ofthem. [We] may have done a little bit of surveillance or talked to neighbors asto whether or not they had seen that. I think we were of the generalunderstanding that, yes, there were very attractive young women coming and goingfrom Mr. Epstein’s residence.“We did some level of further inquiry, and we were of the belief that they wereall adults. And [we] were also of the belief that there was a possibility thatthere could be prostitution. But I mean that’s just not something that weheavily pursued—prostitution in private residences; it’s common everywhere inAmerica. We didn’t believe that they were underage at that point, and so we hadno further interest in it.”Reiter had recalled those complaints on the day Epstein had shown up with his$90,000 donation. And when Reiter had walked Epstein downstairs, he couldn’thelp but notice the tall, beautiful woman whom Epstein had brought with him tothe station.It struck him as strange that she was standing so stiffly, eyes cast downward,as though she were afraid to speak. Not a kid. But not a woman, either. Epsteindid not introduce or even acknowledge her. To Reiter, this, too, seemed odd.Indeed, the statuesque woman was Nadia Marcinkova, a nineteen-year-old beautywho lived at Epstein’s home and was described, by another girl, in a recordedinterview with Detective Recarey, as one of Epstein’s “like, slaves.”In September, several months into the investigation, Epstein calls Reiterdirectly and asks: Has Palm Beach bought the firearms simulator yet?Cautiously, Reiter tells him that they’re still doing research.If the department needs more funds, Epstein says, he’ll be happy to providethem.Reiter thanks him graciously and hangs up. But he’s certain now that Epsteinknows about the investigation. Thinking about Epstein’s crimes in Palm Beachmakes him shudder. And, Reiter knows, if the charges are true, things are goingto get ugly and public.Cops like Reiter are family men, fathers. Some see so much that they’re nolonger surprised by the ways of the world. Still, it helps to hold on to anatural capacity for outrage. Thefts are easy to understand: you see somethingyou need, so you take it. Even murders make a kind of sense once you understandthe motivation. There’s great satisfaction in catching a murderer. But whatEpstein’s been up to is hard to explain.Who is this guy?Reiter’s detectives will have to get into Epstein’s head. To nail him, they’llhave to know him. And to do that, they’ll have to get to know the people aroundhim. The police already know about Wendy. That’s one procurer, but out of howmany?What kind of person would bring children to a child molester?And—Reiter can’t shake the idea—other victims had to be out there. That lined upwith what Epstein’s neighbor reported: there were many girls. He needed to findthem as quickly as possible. It was a race against time.As long as Epstein was free in Palm Beach, more girls were sure to arrive at theside of the house on El Brillo Way."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter012]Alison: September 11, 2005It might start with the Palm Beach Daily News, which usually covers charityballs, equestrian events, and gallery openings. Reporters there would kill tosink their teeth into something so juicy. On top of that, Chief Reiter knows,Palm Beach is full of freelance paparazzi and seasoned semiretired journalists.They’d kill for the story, too. For them, it’d be a real-life Body Heat.Over at WPTV, the local NBC affiliate, the phone rings one day.It’s a tip from a kid, sounding nervous. Something about girls from a local highschool.There’s a prostitution ring out in Palm Beach, says the boy.The tip gets brought up in a midmorning meeting at which the producers divvy upideas among the various reporters and newscasts.“Where, exactly?” a producer asks.“He didn’t say, exactly,” an intern replies. “He said that a very rich man wasinvolved.”“Who?”“Didn’t say.”“Did he leave a call-back number?”“No. The kid sounded really young. Fourteen, fifteen years old.”The producer thinks for a moment, makes a few scratches in his dog-earednotepad.“Okay,” he says. “I’m not sure what we can do with that for the moment.”At some point, some enterprising journalist will put enough pieces together toget a sense of the picture. Sooner or later, someone will talk. Maybe a parent.Maybe a cop’s girlfriend gets giddy at lunch. The girlfriend’s girlfriendmentions it to her husband, who says something to a golfing buddy in turn. Maybethe golfing buddy knows a reporter.Or maybe some lawyer goes off the rez, blitzed off those martinis they serve atthe Palm Beach Grill.Sooner or later, there’s always talk. At that point, Chief Reiter’s job will getmuch, much harder—with Epstein on one side, the press on the other, and thechief taking flak from all sides. But right now, two months into Reiter’sinvestigation, the press is still speaking in whispers.Right now, Reiter wants to keep it that way.And, in the meantime, new pieces of the puzzle keep falling into place.On September 11, a young woman named Alison gets pulled over by the police.*[part0121.xhtml#Footnote_66077] She’s carrying a small amount of marijuana. Thepatrol officer handcuffs her and puts her in the back of his vehicle. ButAlison’s been in the back of a police car before, and she’s cocky and cannyenough to pivot the conversation away from the dime bag she’s been busted with.She tells the officer a remarkable story about an older man engaging in sexualactivities with high school girls. Alison knows about it firsthand, she says.She’s been going to the house on El Brillo Way since she was sixteen.At first the cop’s skeptical. He hasn’t heard about the investigation intoJeffrey Epstein’s affairs. And, after all, Alison is a burnout. But back at thestation, he finds out that Alison has not been bullshitting him.The investigation is real.Alison’s name and cell phone number match up with messages that have been pulledfrom Epstein’s trash. Instead of copping to a misdemeanor, she becomes anotherJane Doe in the case that Chief Reiter’s colleague, Detective Joe Recarey, isbuilding against Jeffrey Epstein.The story Alison ends up telling is extremely disturbing.Like Mary, she says, she was recruited in high school. She tells cops thatEpstein would call her his “number one girl”—although, she suspects, there weremany others.Recarey takes her statement. In the excerpts that follow (transcribed from atape recording made by the Palm Beach police), D stands for “Detective Recarey,”and V stands for “victim.”D:Well, ah, start from, like, how you met him, and then I’ll—I’ll take youthrough.V:Okay. Um, we [Alison and a female friend] worked at Hollister together in theWellington Green mall, and I was mentioning to her how I wanted extra money togo to Maine…I wanted to go camping for the summer, and I couldn’t afford a planeticket. And—she goes, “Oh, well, you can get a plane ticket in two hours.” Isaid, “What are you talking about?” Like, what are you—that didn’t make anysense to me, a plane ticket in two hours; what are you talking about? And shegoes, “Oh, we can go give this guy a massage, and, um, he’ll pay two hundreddollars for, like, forty-five minutes or an hour.” And that’s all she told me—nodetails, no nothing.…She said that he wanted cute girls, so I looked cute, did my best. I didn’t—Ididn’t think that it was what it was. I wasn’t naive enough to think that he wasgonna pay me two hundred dollars just for nothing—I, I don’t know, like, I don’tknow what was going through my head. I absolutely don’t know. And I—the back ofmy mind was thinking, oh, well, it could be legitimate, but I was also thinking,you know, at the same time, is she fucking crazy? Like, this guy’s not gonna payyou money for not doing anything, not letting him cop a feel or nothing. Youknow? So I didn’t know what to think, I was like, “Oh…if he does something thatI have a problem with, then I’ll leave.”…D:Who were you introduced to?V:One of his girlfriends. One of his, like, slaves that he has live with him.And when I say “slaves,” like, one of the girls that he bought to, like, havesex with him. Um, I was introduced to one of them probably, like…Sarah. I wasintroduced to Sarah. Um, that’s his assistant, I think. I think they have sex,but I don’t know. Um, I was introduced to his assistant Sarah, and she’s the onewho told me that he would be ready in a second. And from there I met variousother girls. I don’t really—I didn’t pay attention to who they were,though….So…we were waiting on the couch in the bathroom, and, um, Jeffrey comesup, and he’s like, “Hey, I’m—I’m Jeffrey.” He just introduced himself, and hehands—I remember this ’cause I was pissed off that she got paid to bring me.Like, I was pissed off. He hands her a wad of hundred-dollar bills and says,“Thank you,” and she says, “I’ll wait for you downstairs,” and I was like, “Allright, I’ll see you in a little while.” And that’s how I was brought to Jeffrey.…Um. Hold on—I’m remembering. I’m, like, picturing in my head. I wore a skirt. Iremember specifically what I wore: I wore a skirt and just a regular T-shirt.And I was massaging his legs, and he asked me to take off my skirt. And I said—Ithink I said no at first. And he’s like, “Come on, you’re not showing”—he talkedme into it, basically. He’s like, “Oh, you’re not showing anything,” or [he] didsomething; I don’t even know. So I ended up taking off my skirt, and then hegoes—well, I think he just started touching, you know, the top of me. So—andthen he asked me.D:When you’re saying “the top of you,” you mean your breasts?V:Yeah. And then he asked me to take off my shirt. So I took off my shirt, but Ikept my underwear on. And I wouldn’t take my underwear off: I told him no. Andhe still paid me the same amount. And that was that. I went home.…D:So, in other words, he—V:Finished with himself and that was it. Yeah, he ejaculated. Specifically.D:That was the first time you went there?V:Mm-hmm.D: And—I know, take a deep breath, I know, I can see it in your eyes already.From then on, you went there multiple times?V:I had problems with it. [With] what happened the first time. But three hundreddollars for forty minutes—that was a lot for a sixteen-year-old girl making sixbucks an hour.D:So you’re saying you’re sure you were sixteen now?V:Um, I don’t want to say I’m sure of my age. I was under seventeen, one hundredpercent.…D:Okay. Um, when you—the first time you went, when he masturbated, did you see?V:[giggles]D:His member?V:Oh, I thought you were going to ask me if I saw, like, his come.D:No.V:I saw all of the above.D:You saw him naked, fully naked? Fully naked?V:Yeah, a hundred percent naked. He had a towel on for some of it, but thatdoesn’t mean anything. Like, he was naked.D:He took off the towel?V:I saw everything, yeah.…I mean, I’m sorry, he is circumcised, my bad. He’s circumcised, a hundred andten percent sure. A matter of fact, he has some sort of birth defect. On histhing. I don’t know what it is [giggles]; I’ve never really looked at it,because I’ve never done anything where I had to touch it. I’ve never touchedit—out of the whole time I worked for him, I never touched his penis. Like,he—I’m pretty sure he rubbed it against me, but I’ve never ever been, like,“Okay, I’m letting you do this” or “I’m gonna do this to you.” Um, it’s reallyweirdly shaped. I don’t know—do you want me to, like, tell you this?…I’m just really embarrassed. Um, it’s like a teardrop, like a drop of water.It’s really fat at the bottom and skinny at the top, where it’s attached. And henever gets fully hard, ever. Like, I just could tell by looking at it—like, bylooking you can obviously tell if you’re hard or not, and I could tell that hewasn’t.…D:The next time you went, or as you continued to go, did it escalate more?V.Mm-hmm. I actually—I don’t remember how long it took for me to start workingfor him regularly, from the first time I went there. But I started working everyday. Every single day he was in the country I would be there…And, um, I told himthat I wouldn’t let him put anything inside of me; that was my rule. Nothinginside of me—no fingers, no, no nothing, absolutely nothing inside of me. Heincreased my pay to three or four hundred dollars as long as he could touch me.Um, I still never—I, I swear I never touched him, the whole entire time I never,ever touched him. Um, but he, he—D:How many times would you say you went?V:Hundreds. Hundreds. I was—he used to tell me I was his favorite. He bought mea car. He bought me—D:This Jeep that you’re driving?V:No. I had a brand-new Dodge Neon. I got a plane—I got a plane ticket to NewYork; I got spending money whenever I wanted. Like, I was in there deep. Iwas—he asked my parents to emancipate me so I could live with him. Or he didn’task my parents, he asked me to ask my parents, I’m sorry. He actually wanted meto come live with him.D:As, like, a girlfriend?V:Sex slave, whatever you want to call it. Yeah. Um, but it escalated—he, hejust increased my pay, as long as he could touch me. I wouldn’t let him putanything inside of me. And then one day he just did, one day he just put hishand, like, his fingers—and, um…D:How long, would you say, from the very first time you went?V:Months. Honestly, I never kept track, like, of, of what happened when. I justcan tell you in which order things progressed.…It was—it was, like, towards the middle and end of my school year. But Iremember that for the last, like, six or eight weeks of high school, I didn’thave a car ’cause I gave it back to him. Because he—he asked me to have sex withhim and, like, like suck him and stuff [giggles], and I was just like, no.Definitely not. I was like, “I’ll let you touch me, but I’m not gonna do that.”…Yeah, the car was a Dodge Neon 2005. He got it for me before the New Year,because I remember I got it—it was an edition that was a year before they weresupposed to come out. So if I got it, I obviously didn’t get a 2006, ’causethat’s this year. I got a 2005 Neon in 2004. Seven miles on it when I got it.The car was awesome [giggles].…I gave it back before I graduated. It got too—it got too sticky for me. Hewanted more than I was willing to give. I didn’t wanna—I didn’t want to, um,suck his dick. I didn’t want to have sex with him. I never did that, and Iwanted to be able to walk away from this saying that I—saying that I never didthat. And I’m glad that I did.…But I lied to him when I gave it back. I didn’t want to burn my bridges, becausehe was a spectacular connection to have. Spectacular. Even if I didn’t—even whenI didn’t work for him. Until this day, he is so aw—he is so—I haven’t talked tohim in, like, a couple months, but if I called him today he would give me asmuch money as I asked him for. He doesn’t know that I hate him the way I do. Ikept that connection. I figured he used me, I’d be able to use him. Um, I hateto say that, but I figured if I wanted to use him I could.D:Okay. Let me bring you back a little bit.V:Sure.D:When did things start to escalate as far as things happening when the massageswere given?V:They escalated whenever he wanted. I don’t clearly understand the question.D:Okay. The first time you went, you were naked—V:Are you asking for a date?D:Oh, no, no, no—V:…and the little steps that things progressed?D:Right.V:Well, I went and I wouldn’t take off my panties at first. And then he got meto get naked. Then he got me to let him rub me. Then he got me to let him stickhis fingers in me. Then he got me to let him go down on me. Then, um—that waspretty much the gist of it, except this one time, where he bent me over thetable and put himself in me. Without my permission. And I flipped out. I’msorry, I didn’t ask you, but I don’t count that as me having sex with him….’Cause I just told you that I never had sex with him. I never did. Even though,I don’t know what you’d consider that. But he then—I go, “What are you doing?”He goes, “Oh, I just wanted [redacted] to see this.”D:Okay. Let me back you up. When you were completely naked, the same thingshappened? You went in, you massaged him?V:Sometimes I didn’t even do that. Sometimes he just asked me to take off myclothes and—he’d have to do work, he’d be sitting at his desk or something, andI’d just be naked there, watching television or reading a book, but I’d benaked. Or, um, sometimes he wanted to just watch TV or read, and he’d lay in hisbed and ask me to take my clothes off and lay with him. And that’s it. Not touchhim or anything….Sometimes he’d just invite me over for breakfast, for dinner,or just to use the swimming pool, and I’d get paid for that, too. I’d get paidjust to hang out with him. That’s it. And if the money wasn’t there, I wouldn’thave ever been in that house.D:Okay. When he started to touch you—V:I have a question. Before I say anything else. Um, is there a possibility thatI’m gonna have to go to court or anything? Like, that’s a possibility, right?D:Well, here’s the thing: When this is all said and done, we’re going to sitdown, we’re going to discuss this. I mean, what he did to you is a crime. I’mnot gonna lie to you.V:Would you consider it rape? Like, would you consider that to be rape, what hedid?D:If he put himself inside you, without permission—V:I didn’t say that, or anything. I was standing up and the table is about,like, my hip length—he just put me down—D:That, that is a crime. That is a crime.V:I don’t want my family to find out about this. My family doesn’t know any ofthis. My mom thinks I was his secretary, for two years, or however long—a yearand a half. My mom thinks I made phone calls for him and that’s how I was makingmy [unintelligible] money. That’s it. I don’t want her to know anything.D:Well, you’re an adult. You’re an adult now….When we’re done with thisinterview, we’ll discuss this further and we’ll decide the best course.V:’Cause Jeffrey’s gonna get me. You guys realize that, right? He’s gonnafind—he’s gonna figure this out. And he’s gonna—I’m not safe now. You understandthat, right? I’m not safe.D:He is not this person that he is portraying himself to be—V: Well—D:Why do you say you’re not safe? Has he said he’s hurt people before?V:Well, I’ve heard him make threats to people on the telephone, yeah. Of course.D:You’re gonna die? You’re gonna break your legs? Or—V:All the above! But that’s not the point.D:Who’s he talking to?V:I don’t know. I don’t know, I heard those conversations, I mean, I’ve been inthe room when he was on the phone and [unintelligible] threatened. Like, Iwitnessed lots of things. I just don’t know what, specifically, you all [want toknow].D:Everything.V:I used to go there every day, like I w—I don’t, I don’t know how many othergirls he was saying, “You’re my favorite, and I want you to live with me” to,but I was in about as deep as you can get.D:He had quite a few girls he would say that to.…D:Do you have any formal massage training?V:[Giggles.] Hell, no.D:All right, I was just asking.…V:He would kiss me and stuff, too. I remember that. And when he kissed me, if hewas jerking off he would, like, rub himself on my breasts. And I…I was extremelyuncomfortable. I would maneuver myself away from that activity. I’d get up andI’d move somewhere else, or I’d—I don’t even remember. I would stop whatever wasgoing on without saying, “Can you get the fuck off me?” I would stop it withoutsaying stuff like that.D:Okay.…V:I wouldn’t let him put anything in me until one day he did just out ofnowhere. And I said, “Wait a second: my boyfriend, you know, we had this thing,you can’t do that. You know, I’m—I’m allowed to work here as long as you don’tdo that.” And he said “okay.” Well, a couple months later I guess he assumed meand my boyfriend had broken up, and he just did it one day; he just did itwithout asking or anything. And then I said, “What are you doing?” I said, “Youknow that’s not cool,” and he goes, “Oh, I thought we did that last time.” And Isaid, “No, we did not do that last time.” And then he goes—uh, and then he justoffered me more money. He’s like, “Well, why don’t I just give you somethingextra, and we can try this out?” And I was like [sigh], “All right.” Very hardguy to say no to. I don’t know if any of you guys ever talked to him….…Oh, yeah. Well, if you talk to him, I mean, he straight up tries to control thesituation. Every—every word that comes out of your mouth, it seems like, heknows what you are going to say. Like, that’s his job; that’s how he made hismoney is knowing what people are gonna say and what people are gonna do.D:What did he tell you he does for a living?V:Well, there’s a couple of things. Things that I found for myself, things Ilooked up on the Internet. What he specifically told me when I asked him thefirst time was, “Oh, I’m a brain scientist.” And I said, “What the fuck is abrain scientist?” I was like, “That’s not a real job—tell me the truth.” Butanyway…his explanation was, “It’s my job to know how people’s brains work.” AndI said, “Whatever the fuck that means. Whatever. You’re like some old guy who[unintelligible….]” You know what he promised me? Here’s the reason I held on solong is, he promised me that I would get into NYU. That I would get into NYU andhe would pay for it. And I waited, and I waited, and I scored great on my SATs,I would get 4.0—like, I did great in school. I filled out my application and hetold me that it wasn’t good enough. So I filled it out again, and it was likethree times. So I’m pretty sure he wasn’t checking into it, he was just tellingme that he was. But I think that had a lot to do with the reason I stayed thereso long, ’cause my dream was right in front of me, you know? And it’s so far….D:Aside from having been with [redacted], was there anybody else that youbrought to the house?V:I brought a few people….Because it got out that I did this. Like, everyone atschool knew. You know, everyone talks—D:It was a circle, and—V:It was a little circle, yeah….Not that I would want anybody to get involved….Ibrought girls I didn’t like and, frankly, did not give a shit about. Girls thatI knew were skanks. That would do anything. Girls that would just, like, suckdick in the bathroom at school. Like, not even people I was friends with. I’djust hear a rumor about a girl and be like, “Hey, I know a way you can make twohundred dollars. How about…” I would tell them flat out, like, “This is whatyou’ve got to do. Are you cool with this? ’Cause I’m not gonna take you ifyou’re not.” So I told them. They all know that I got paid to bring them. It wasactually [redacted]. She took off her shirt. She was a little overweight, so hedidn’t want anything to do [with her]. She was my best friend. But, you know,she was another story. I did care about her. But, um, she lost her house andstuff and really needed money. She had—she was homeless, she had nowhere to go.So she did it out of desperation.…D:Did he ever hurt you?V:Sometimes he got violent, yeah.D:Violent as in what? As in—V:He pulled my hair a lot harder than it should have been pulled. Like, he—okay,I can understand having sex, and you’re all, like, not—not that we were havingsex, but I mean, like, if you’re all into it and you pull hair a little bit,like, my ponytails—just like a little bit, whatever. But he would pull it towhere it would rip my hair out. It would rip my hair, and then sometimes hewould pick me up and, like, throw me whichever way he wanted me, and then hewould just like use a toy or, like, his hand or whatever. Never his penis,though, ever. I never had sex with him. But um—I’m little, so he could pick meup. Like, if you pick me up and throw, obviously it’s gonna hurt….…I mean, there’s been nights that I walked out of there barely able to walk, um,from him being so rough. But nothing really—nothing specific that he really gotviolent with. Like, I can’t really recall.…Nothing that I went to the doctor for, no. I mean, I remember getting tore up afew times, but it was nothing that—…D:This is getting real personal, but were you active before him?V:What, like, had I had sex? Yeah [laughs].D:Okay.V:Um. But honest, I mean, I’m not—I’m not a ho. I’ve had only three steadyboyfriends, and those are the only three that I’ve ever done anything with. Andthey were all with me for over a year. So it’s not like I just go and hook up atparties.…Like, I’ve gotten thousands of dollars’ worth of shit. Man, the underwear I’mwearing right now he gave me. Like, I’d—I’d go over there and there’d be a bagof Victoria’s Secret underwear, like, waiting for me, like, talking, like,fifteen hundred dollars’ worth of stuff. I got a plane ticket from him once. Igot a car, I got Christmas bonuses, I got movie tickets. Like, he’d buy me movietickets—like, he’d say, “Hey, have you gone to the movies lately?” I’d be like,“I dunno, oh—not really,” [and] he goes, “Do you want to go?” He’d give me,like, eight movie tickets. I got show tickets; I went and saw, like, DavidCopperfield. I had, like, VIP tickets or something like that.…I need to show you, like, what I’m talking about, like, the positioning that wewere—it was like, okay, here’s the thing: there’s the, like, little flowerthing, then here’s the massage table. I was right here, he was right here, [and]she was here. Um. And I was standing up, and he just pushed me over the table,and he did his thing with me.D:Okay. Were you facing the table? Were you?V:I was. I was facedown on the table. Like, facedown, hands, like, on my head,holding—I don’t, I don’t mean—I wasn’t fighting, really. So I don’t know if hewas holding me down to kinda stop me from fighting or what he was doing. He’sjust a really weird—he’s into really weird stuff. Like, I was just bent over,and my face was on the table. I was facedown on the table. And then he did histhing. So. But anyway, [redacted] was right here, and I’m pretty sure she wasnaked, and the couch is, like, right behind, but, um, that’s how it happened….Hewas only in me for, like, a minute or two. I don’t even know if you could saythat long. He put it in, did a couple of pumps, or whatever the fuck you wannacall it, and I was like, “What are you doing?” [giggles] I go, “What are youdoing?” He’s like, “Oh, I just wanted [redacted] to see this.” Then that wasthat."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter013]Wendy Dobbs: October 3, 2005Every chance he gets—and he gets lots of chances—Chief Reiter drills the samething into his investigators’ heads: they need to be careful. Patient.Methodical. Strategic. Or Epstein’s lawyers will eat them for lunch.Inch by inch, they move their case toward the goalpost. But in October,Detective Recarey and his coworkers catch a break that moves the ball severalyards down the field.On the first Monday of that month, they pick Wendy up at her house and, down atthe police station, she starts to sing—like a bird.The detectives can hardly believe it or get it all down fast enough. Later on,in a probable-cause affidavit, Detective Recarey will write:Approximately two years ago, just after she turned 17 years of age, [Wendy] wasapproached by a friend named Molly at the Canopy Beach Resort in Riviera Beach.[Dobbs] was asked if she wanted to make money. She was told she would have toprovide a massage and should make $200. [Dobbs] thought about the offer andagreed to meet with Jeffrey.Molly (Unknown last name) and Tony (Unknown last name) picked [Dobbs] up and shewas taken to Epstein’s house. Upon her arrival to the house she was introducedto Epstein in the kitchen of the house. She was also introduced to a whitefemale known to her as Sarah. She was led upstairs to the main bedroom known toher as Jeff Epstein’s bedroom.Sarah arranged the massage table and covered the table with a sheet. She broughtout the massage oils and laid them next to the massage bed. Sarah then left theroom and informed [Dobbs] Jeff would be in, in a minute. Jeff entered thebedroom wearing only a towel.He removed the towel and laid nude on the massage table. He laid on the tableonto his stomach and picked a massage oil for [Dobbs] to rub on him.“He tried to touch me, and I stopped him,” says Dobbs.I asked how he tried to touch her. [Dobbs] stated that Epstein grabbed herbuttocks and she felt uncomfortable.“I’ll massage you,” Dobbs had told Epstein. “But I don’t want to be touched.”[Dobbs] stated she performed the massage naked. At the conclusion of themassage, Epstein paid [Dobbs] $200.After the massage Epstein stated to [Dobbs] that he understood she was notcomfortable, but he would pay her if she brought over some girls. He told herthe younger the better. [Dobbs] stated she once tried to bring a 23-year-oldfemale and Epstein stated that the female was too old. [Dobbs] stated that intotal she only remembers six girls that she brought to see Epstein. Each timeshe was paid $200. [Dobbs] said at the time she brought these girls to Epstein’shouse they were all 14 through 16 [years] of age.Wendy Dobbs keeps talking. What she says about Mary’s visit lines up neatly withwhat Mary’s already told the police. Wendy’s own experience with Epstein syncsup, too. But Wendy’s not a victim, as Mary is. After all, she’s been playing onEpstein’s team. Team predator.A police sergeant enters the room. What he wants to know is, does Wendy realizethat she’s implicated herself in Epstein’s crimes?Beads of sweat form on Wendy’s forehead, and now the police know they’ve reallygot her. She gives them phone numbers to go with the young girls she’s named.She provides addresses. But no, Wendy doesn’t quite get it.

Your Pepsi’s coming, my Pepsi’s coming. First of all, I knowyou’re freaking out. Don’t freak out, just relax. Okay? I want to thank you forcoming. All right? Though the door’s closed, you’re free to go at any time.You’re not here—you know, it’s only closed for our privacy.DOBBS: That’s fine.RECAREY: I understand that you may have information on a case that we’re lookinginto, okay? That’s the reason why I brought you here today. All right? Andagain, you’re here voluntarily. You agreed to come back with us and talk to us.But I do want to talk you about Jeff Epstein, and the whole…thing.DOBBS: And I don’t need a lawyer, right?RECAREY: It’s up to you. If you wanted one, you can have one. I can’t tell youyes or no on that. That’s totally [up] to you, I’m only—DOBBS: I’m not gonna get in trouble for anything I say, right?RECAREY: Right now, you’re just a witness. I’m talking to you as awitness….That’s totally up to you. You wanna talk to me?DOBBS: I have no problem telling you everything I know. I’m a very cooperativeperson.RECAREY: Okay. How did you first meet, um—DOBBS: I first met Jeffrey—I was at a beach resort on Singer Island, and I wasapproached by this girl I went to school with. Her name was [redacted]. And shewas asking me, you know, “Oh, you need extra money, I know this guy….” I thoughtabout it and I finally gave her a call, and her and her friend [redacted] met upwith me. I actually picked them up and we drove down to Jeffrey’s house. Sheintroduced me, whatever.RECAREY: Okay. Now, what [do] you mean by making money, how do you make moneywith Jeffrey?DOBBS: Um, there’s two ways. There’s two ways you can make money. He’ll, allright—RECAREY: That’s all right. Talk to me. Talk to me like, like nothin’.DOBBS: How do I say—this is going to sound really sleazy, but—RECAREY: No. Go ahead. Talk to me.DOBBS: Every girl that meets Jeffrey starts off with giving him a massage. Themore you do with him, the more you make. Basically, if you take off yourclothes, you’re gonna make more. If you let him do things to you, you’re gonnamake more.RECAREY: Like “do things” you mean, touch you?DOBBS: Yeah. Touch you in inappropriate places.RECAREY: Okay. Does he use his hand? Does he—DOBBS: He uses his hands and, I really wouldn’t call it a vibrator—I guess it’slike a massager? But um—I was one of the girls that refused to do that. I did itbasically my—I did it naked, but I wouldn’t let him touch me or anything likethat. So after that he’s like, “You know what?” He’s like, “Listen, I’ll pay you$200 for every girl that you bring to me.” He’s like, “I don’t want you tomassage me anymore, you know, just bring girls to me….” So that’s the other wayyou can make money. For every girl that you bring to the table—so, for everygirl that I brought to Jeffrey—I would make $200. Flat. Just right there.RECAREY: Just to bring a girl.DOBBS: Yeah. Just to bring a girl.RECAREY: Okay. And the girl that was going knew that she would have to massagehim.DOBBS: She knew everything. She knew everything. That was one of Jeffrey’srules. He had a problem with girls coming to the house that didn’t know whatthey were getting into. He would tell me, you know, “Make sure these girls knowwhat I expect, make sure they know what they want, because when I get in thatroom I don’t want them to—you know—they need to know.” And, as far as[redacted]’s case, she knew everything she was getting herself into. It was allvolunteer.RECAREY: Okay. What did you tell her that she was gonna do?DOBBS: I told her the same thing. I told her, you know, this guy Jeffrey—shecame to me saying she needed money, da da da. I basically told her about it. Shewas like, um, you know, “What do you have to do?” I told her. I was like, “Themore you do, the more you make. That’s it. In order to make money, you’re gonnahave to go up there. You’re gonna take your clothes off. But the more you do, isthe more you make.” She walked out of there with $300. So she obviously andevidently let him do a little more. Plus, on our way home, she kinda told mewhat she did.RECAREY: Which was? Give the massage….DOBBS: She gave the massage, and she basically let him, like, touch her, downthere. Basically.RECAREY: Did he touch her with his hands?DOBBS: All with his hands. And then he brought out the massager. From what shetold me.…RECAREY: How old were you when you were approached to see Jeffrey?DOBBS: Um, I think I was seventeen?RECAREY: Seventeen.DOBBS: Sixteen or seventeen.RECAREY: Okay. When was the last time you talked to him?DOBBS: It’s been a while. I can honestly say it’s probably been about close to ayear. About a year. I actually stopped working for him.RECAREY: Who was the last girl you brought over?DOBBS: The last girl I brought over was [redacted]….RECAREY: Okay. You got paid two hundred bucks for taking her over?DOBBS: Yes.RECAREY: Okay. [Redacted] knew…DOBBS: She knew everything.RECAREY: That she’d have to massage him, and the more she did—DOBBS: The more she’d make.RECAREY: The more she got paid.DOBBS: Yeah.RECAREY: So, she had intercourse with him.DOBBS: Um, I don’t know about the intercourse. I heard different stories onthat. I’ve never asked him “Oh, you know…” But when I was first introduced tohim, my friend [redacted] who introduced me to him, told me that she knew a girlwho slept with him and made $1,000. But from what his intern—or secretary—toldme, is that he doesn’t do that. He just plays around with them. So I heard twodifferent stories.…RECAREY: So, when you went and you massaged him, nothing happened between youtwo.DOBBS: Nothing. I wouldn’t let him.RECAREY: Okay. Did he become forceful? Did he get upset?DOBBS: I wouldn’t say he became upset. I think he was a little disappointed. ButI’m not—I didn’t care. I knew I was getting paid. I let him—I let him look, butI never let him touch. It was out of the question for him. And I think that’spretty much why he just, kind of down-promoted me? He was just kind of like,“You can bring girls.” But as far as working, you know—RECAREY: Okay. How many girls have you brought to him, aside from [redacted]?DOBBS: Oh. Um. A lot.RECAREY: A lot?DOBBS: Um, let’s see, there’s [several redacted names]….RECAREY: And all these girls knew what they had to do?DOBBS: Every one of them.…RECAREY: How long have you been working for him?DOBBS: Um…I probably worked for him for a year.RECAREY: Okay. And out of all these girls…DOBBS: Those were all the girls I brought. But you have to remember, those girlsbrought other girls, too.RECAREY: Oh, okay.DOBBS: So it’s like—it’s like a train. It’s like, I introduced him to all myfriends, and then…it goes on and on, like that.…RECAREY: Okay….[Redacted] being fourteen or fifteen at the time—I think[redacted] was fourteen when this happened—who else was underage? Out of allthese?DOBBS: Underage, what do you mean?RECAREY: Under eighteen.DOBBS: Under eighteen? All of ’em.RECAREY: All of them?DOBBS: All of them….RECAREY: Okay. Did Jeff know anybody’s real true age? Or he didn’t care.DOBBS: I don’t think he cared. He told me the younger the better.RECAREY: The younger the better. All right.DOBBS: Pretty much. That’s how it worked. He didn’t—let me just put it this way:I tried to bring him a woman who was twenty-three, and he didn’t really like it.RECAREY: Didn’t go for it.DOBBS: It’s not that he didn’t go for it. He just didn’t care for it. And helikes the girls that [are] between the ages of, like, eighteen and twenty….Butsome of them, I think, lie about their age. I know that when I started offyoung, I think he knew better [than] to believe me. I think he knew that I wasyounger—like, seventeen—but I told him I was, like, eighteen. Most of thosegirls lie when they go in there.…RECAREY: Let’s talk about [Mary] for a minute.DOBBS: Okay.RECAREY: [Mary] at the time was dating your cousin, right?DOBBS: Mm-hmm.RECAREY: Okay. She told you she needed to make money. Did she know you workedfor Jeffrey?DOBBS: I told her.RECAREY: You had told her you worked for Jeffrey.DOBBS: Mm-hmm.RECAREY: Did you tell her what it entailed? So she knew that?DOBBS: She knew everything before she even agreed to it.RECAREY: Okay. So she knew that there was going to have to be some kind of—DOBBS: Contact. Pretty much. Yeah. I told her. I told her exactly what hisexpectations were. I told her what goes on with the girls that go up there. Itold her—it was like, “It’s your call.” I was like, “If you want to do this,fine. If not, fine. But when you go in that room, I don’t want to hear you say,‘Oh, I didn’t know he was going to do all that.’ Because I’m telling you rightnow, he’s expecting it.”RECAREY: Basically, this is touching—DOBBS: Fondling—RECAREY: Fondling—DOBBS: Or whatever. And I told her when she went on her own. Just like, “Justremember, the more you do, the more you make. But that’s—that’s up to you.” Andshe asked me, and I brought up, told her I wouldn’t do more.RECAREY: Okay. You made that clear, you wouldn’t do more.DOBBS: No. Screw that!RECAREY: But as far as [Mary] is concerned. What did she tell you that happenedin that room?DOBBS: Exact words? If I can recall, when she came downstairs from—when she camedownstairs, me and her and [redacted], we all walked out. We got into the car.And I was like, “How much did you make?” She’s like, “Three hundred dollars.”And I looked at [Mary] and I just knew right then she did more.RECAREY: Than just a massage, right?DOBBS: Yeah. And I asked her. I was like, “Well, what’d you do?” She’s like,“Well, I started giving a massage, and then my clothes came off and, you know,he put his fingers inside me. And then he brought out the massager.” And that’sbasically what she said.…RECAREY: It’s all right. You can talk to me. It’s all right.DOBBS: It’s kind of incredible talking about it, now that I—I can’t believe Iworked for him.RECAREY: But it’s okay. You know what, we all go through things in life, youknow what I mean? It’s an experience. And you can put this experience behindyou.…Do girls that—people that you brought over—how did you approach them? That theywere going to have to do this…Like, if they wanted to work, how did you approachthem? Say, “Listen, I got this guy in Palm Beach?”DOBBS: Um…Two of them were my friends. The others were, like, my acquaintances.It was a little more easier talking to them about it, ’cause, like, I knew them.RECAREY: Take a deep breath. Take a deep breath. ’Cause I can see you’re workingup again. You’re working up the tears, I can see it, and I don’t want to get youlike that.DOBBS: I, um, pretty much I just would ask them—RECAREY: Straight up?DOBBS: “If you’re looking for extra money, let me know; this guy down in PalmBeach, he’s really, really, really wealthy. You have to give him a massage.”That’s all I would tell them. Then, if they were interested or told me, “Yes, Iwant to do it,” I’d go into detail with them before they’d actually agree. Ifthey told me, “Yeah, that sounds good, I’m interested,” then I’d tell them,“Okay, well I’m gonna let you know, this is what you have to do, this is what’sgonna go on.”RECAREY: Did you tell them that you were going to make money from bringing themover? Or—DOBBS: Most part? I believe they knew….Most of the girls, we were open aboutthat. We didn’t—they pretty much knew I was making money under the table. So…RECAREY: Okay. Gimme two seconds. Let me get the soda….Gimme two seconds.…All right, I talked to my boss a little bit—FRICK:—Which is why I’m here.DOBBS: Okay.FRICK: Obviously I was listening to what you were saying. And at this point youclearly implicated yourself on a crime, okay? You’ve taken girls to somebody’shouse for the purpose of prostitution. More importantly, more significantly, oneof those girls was fourteen at the time, okay? Now that’s a pretty significantsecond-degree felony, okay? I’m not going to kid you, that is—it’s a significantthing, okay? Now, you came in, you cooperated with us. The question we have foryou now is, do you want to continue cooperating with us and try and help us makea case against Jeff?DOBBS: I don’t think that’s really going to help me in the long run, though.I’ve already admitted to a second-degree felony, right?FRICK: Yeah, you have.DOBBS: Okay, so there you go. What’s going to keep me out of trouble? It’s notgoing to keep me out of trouble. I’ve already admitted committing a crime.FRICK: I’m not going to argue with that….DOBBS: So basically I just fucked myself. I can go two ways. I can agree not tocooperate, which is going to put me at—well—now you can use the second-degreefelony against me. Or you can help and work with it and maybe get myself someslack….FRICK: We’re still talkin’ here. What would the odds be of you contacting Jeffat this point? Have you had any contact with him at all?DOBBS: I have not had any contact—FRICK: How about with—DOBBS: No, none of ’em. None of ’em….I had a phone call about four or fivemonths ago, and I told my parents. Look, I swear to you I’m not anywhere—like,no connection with him at all. That’s why I pretty much got my number changed. Ihave not made any communication with him. It stopped.FRICK: Okay. Well, I mean, that’s good. That’s good that you stopped….…This is what we’d like to do: We would like to reach out to some of yourex-friends and [unintelligible] talk to them. Now, the question is, do we thinkthat they are currently still working for Jeff, in which case they would make aphone call to Jeff? Or can we just kinda show up and, you know, have you make acall as we’re standing outside and say: “Hey, you know, these guys wanna talk toyou, and I’ve already told ’em everything?” Our goal is to make a better caseagainst Jeff, all right?RECAREY: With your cooperation.FRICK: Let me, let me get back to—past—the cooperation thing, okay? There arelesser charges that can easily be filed: leading to the delinquency of a minor,as compared to a second-degree felony. You know what I mean? That’s amisdemeanor….First of all, I’ll tell you straight up, okay, we’re not going totake you to jail today….DOBBS: Not today.FRICK: Well, you’re—And here’s the other thing: If you cooperate and if wecan—If you cooperate, whether we pull it off or not—that’s not up to you, that’sup to us, okay? So what we would do is if we ended up charging you with like amisdemeanor, we’d give you a call, we’d say: “Hey, you gotta come in, you know.”RECAREY: You sign it….FRICK: That’s our preference. You come in, you’ve been very forthright with us,you’ve been very up front—RECAREY: Very truthful.…FRICK: Do you want us to call your parents, or do you want to deal with it, ordo you—As far as we’re concerned you’re an adult, okay? You’re nineteen. You dowhat you do. You know, we can drop you off at the end of the block if you’dlike. Or we can cushion the blow beyond what—but again, you’re helping us atthis point. We’ve been pretty forthright with you on what is going on, ouroptions for your future. And what we’d like you to do obviously is make a coupleof calls with us this evening to talk to a couple of your, you know, these othergirls.DOBBS: I’m not really on a…Me and my parents really don’t get along right now…FRICK: So you’d prefer that—DOBBS: If they found out that I was—If they found out that I was into some otherstuff….I’m actually stripping now….So they’re not exactly happy with me at themoment, and I don’t want to do anything that’s going to piss ’em off evenfurthermore."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter015]Michael Reiter: October 3, 2005Chief Reiter sifts through the evidence: information about underage girls—six ofthem—whom Wendy Dobbs procured for Epstein. Phone numbers pulled from the trashon El Brillo. An arrest report for Alison, the girl who’d been caught with adime bag of weed.She’d told Detective Recarey about an encounter that sounded very much like arape.Soon Reiter will ask a judge for a warrant. But not yet. There’s more footworkto do, and Reiter calls Detective Joe Recarey into his office.Later that day, Detective Recarey and Sergeant George Frick arrive at the homeof a girl named Jenny.* [part0121.xhtml#Footnote_66079] An older woman greetsthem at the front door and invites them inside. She introduces them to herhusband and daughter. Jenny is sixteen years old. Sitting down at the diningroom table, they see that she’s nervous. In between biting her lip andfidgeting, she tells them that yes, she’s been to Jeffrey Epstein’s house.Wendy took her there once. But nothing much happened. She met Epstein’s chef andspent some time in the kitchen is all. Then she left.“I get what you’re asking,” she says. “But really, I just want to put the wholething behind me.”“Okay,” the officers tell her. “You have our numbers. But Jenny, if you rememberanything else, you’ll find that we’re very good listeners.”One down. Five to go.Detective Recarey and Detective Michael Dawson have better luck the next daywith Francine, a girl who tells them that a year earlier, Wendy Dobbs—someoneshe knew from high school—drove her to the house on El Brillo Way.Francine would have been seventeen at the time.Now she’s willing to make a sworn statement. The officers noted:She was told she could make money working for Jeff. She was told she would haveto provide a massage for Jeff….She was brought to the kitchen area by [Dobbs].They met with the house chef who was already in the Kitchen area. Francinestated [Wendy] would wait for her in the kitchen.Just as she did with Mary, a woman named Sarah had taken Francine upstairs andinto a bedroom. Then Epstein had entered the room, wearing only a towel.She kept her clothes on during the massage. She advised sometime during themassage, Epstein grabbed her buttocks and pulled her close to him. Francine saidshe was [made] uncomfortable by the incident involving Jeff. At the conclusionof the massage she was paid $200.00 for the massage.“Do you have any formal training in massages?” the officers ask.“No,” says Francine.But she does have one more thing to tell them.Sarah’s been calling Francine’s cell phone.It could mean any number of things. The police know already that Epstein’scaught wind of their investigation. Now it appears he’s doing something aboutit, or at least he’s delegating the responsibility. This troubles the cops. Butthen, on that same day, they get one more break: Jenny calls and says thatwithout her parents around she’s willing to make a sworn statement.It turns out that Jenny’s visited with Epstein several times.And, it turns out, she’d done much more than sit in the kitchen. Without herparents around, she’s much more willing to talk about it.The first time she’d gone to the house on El Brillo Way, she says, Epstein hadtried to take off her shirt. She’d become upset, and this had led to a fight—a“verbal disagreement”—with Epstein.She’d left without getting paid. Gone down to the kitchen and told Wendy, “Let’sgo!”“If you’re uncomfortable,” Wendy had told her, “tell him to stop, and he will.”On the other hand, Wendy had also told her, “The more you do, the more you getpaid.”A few weeks later, she agreed to return to the house on El Brillo.Once again Sarah had taken Jenny upstairs and into the master bedroom. Sarah hadset up the massage table, laid out the oils that Jenny would use.Then Epstein had entered the room wearing only a towel.Jenny had been wearing tight jeans. She had a tight belt on. She kept the jeanson, though Epstein still made a grab for her buttocks. Then he rolled onto hisback and grabbed for her breasts. Jenny became upset yet again. But this time,she was paid two hundred dollars before leaving. She never did go back to thehouse. But, like Francine, she has one more thing to tell the detectives.Another girl from her high school had been there on the day of her second visitwith Epstein. Kristina. And later, Kristina told Jenny that she also had “aproblem” with Epstein.Girls seemed to be turning up all the time. And the detectives were just gettingstarted.One girl leads Chief Reiter’s team to another. And every time, they hear thesame story. The girls are approached by Wendy Dobbs. They drive over toEpstein’s house. After a short wait in the kitchen—maybe some milk and cereal,if they feel hungry—they’re walked upstairs. Epstein’s there, waiting, wearinghis towel. Sometimes with a vibrator. Sometimes the girls recommend theirfriends, and for this they receive a commission.None of the girls comes from money. And none of them has been trained as amasseuse. Then again, how could they be? To become a licensed massage apprenticein Florida, you need to be eighteen years old, at least, and have a high schooldiploma or GED."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter016]Cynthia: October 6, 2005Three days after meeting with Francine, the police drive to Boca Raton. They’rethere to see Cynthia Selleck, who’s eighteen years old.*[part0121.xhtml#Footnote_66081] But according to the probable-cause affidavitthat the Palm Beach PD is preparing in order to obtain an arrest warrant forEpstein, Cynthia was sixteen when Wendy Dobbs first took her to meet him.During a sworn taped statement, she tells the police that she’d met Wendy at herhigh school. She says that Wendy had recruited her and prepped her for her firstvisit to Epstein’s house. And she says she’d ended up going to the house “a lotof times to provide massages over the past two years.” The affidavit states:She considered Epstein a pervert, and he kept pushing to go further and furtheruntil [Cynthia] explained she would keep telling him she had a boyfriend.Only recently, Cynthia says, did she begin to remove her clothes in the courseof giving Epstein massages.“Jeff would try to get away with more and more on each massage,” she tells thecops.Still, Sarah had Cynthia’s cell phone number, and Sarah would call wheneverEpstein was in Palm Beach to make an appointment for “work.”Each time she went, Sarah would meet her at the kitchen door area. She wouldbring her upstairs and prepare the massage table. [Cynthia] advised Epsteinwould ask her questions about herself. Epstein knew she was a soccer player andwould be attending [a nearby] university.The cops want to know: Did Epstein know her real age?[Cynthia] stated Epstein did and didn’t care. The most recent massage sheprovided was on October 1, 2005.October 1.That’s less than a week ago.What the cops know now is that Epstein’s still at it.What they’re about to learn seals Epstein’s fate."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter017]Alison: October 11, 2005After speaking with Cynthia, Detectives Recarey and Dawson meet up, once again,with Alison. It’s been exactly one month since her arrest, and once again, she’swilling to talk. They have no trouble obtaining her sworn taped statement.Alison is eighteen, but she’s been going to Epstein’s house since 2002. Thingsgot off to a slow start, she says. She received two hundred dollars for herfirst session, during which she had her bra off but her underwear on. Still, atthe end of the session, Epstein had asked for her number.Then the sessions got heavier. Much heavier, as Detective Recarey already knew.[Alison] stated that during her many visits a routine was established betweenher and Epstein, he wrote in his report.She would enter the house and get naked in the bedroom. She would then startwith a back massage. Epstein would roll on to his back and allow her to massagehis chest area. [Alison] stated Epstein would then begin to masturbate himselfand at the same time would insert his fingers in her vagina and masturbate herwith his fingers.[Alison] explained Epstein would continue this process until he ejaculated. Hewould then utilize a vibrator/massager on her vagina until [Alison] climaxed.[Alison] advised that during her frequent visits, Epstein asked for her realage, [and Alison] stated she was sixteen. Epstein advised her not to tell anyoneher real age. [Alison] advised that things escalated within the home as Epsteinwould instruct and pay [Alison] to have intercourse with his female friend, NadaMarcinkova [sic]. [Alison] explained the intercourse included using strap ondildos, large rubber penis’[sic] and other devices that Epstein had at hisdisposal. Epstein would watch them have intercourse and masturbate himself.Occasionally, Epstein would then join in during the female on female intercourseand provide oral sex to both [Alison] and Marcinkova. This occurred during thetime [Alison] was sixteen years of age.[Alison] advised this continued to escalate during two years. The routine becamefamiliar to [Alison]. Epstein’s assistant Sarah would telephone her every timeEpstein was in the Town of Palm Beach and would place appointments for her tovisit and work for Epstein. Each time something new was introduced, additionalmonies were produced and offered for [Alison] to allow the acts to happen.[Alison] consented to perform all these acts but was adamant that there was anunderstanding with Epstein that no vaginal penetration would occur with hispenis. [Alison] explained that Epstein’s penis was deformed. [She] explainedthat his penis was oval shaped. [She] claimed when Epstein’s penis was erect, itwas thick toward the bottom but was thin and small toward the head portion.[She] called Epstein’s penis “egg-shaped.” [She] stated Epstein would photographMarcinkova and her naked and having sex and proudly display the photographswithin the home. [Alison] stated during one visit to Epstein’s house in whichshe provided a massage to Epstein, his female friend, Nada [sic] Marcinkova, wasalso present. [Alison] provided the massage in which Marcinkova and her wouldfondle each other’s breasts and kiss for Epstein to enjoy. Towards the end ofthis massage, Epstein grabbed [Alison] and turned her over onto her stomach onthe massage table and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina: [Alison]stated Epstein began to pump his penis in her vagina. [She] became upset overthis. She said her head was being held against the table forcibly, as hecontinued to pump inside her. She screamed “No!” and Epstein stopped. She toldhim that she did not want to have his penis inside of her. Epstein did notejaculate inside of her and apologized for his actions and subsequently paid hera thousand dollars for that visit. [Alison] stated she knows he still displaysher photographs through out the house.What happened to Mary had been bad enough. But what happened to Alison was on awhole other level. She’d been caught with some pot, sure. But that was hardly afelony offense. It didn’t make her a liar. And, in important respects, Alison’sstatement had aligned with Mary’s and with statements they’d been given by othergirls, including Wendy Dobbs. Could Wendy be trusted? Probably not. Almostcertainly not. But again, what she said was also in line with what the policehad heard from other girls.Detective Recarey and his team had done exceptional work on the investigationthat Officer Pagan had started.It was enough, Reiter decided, to cause a judge to issue a search warrant."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter018]Michael Reiter: October 2005On October 20, Palm Beach police officers execute a search warrant, signed byJudge Laura Johnson, at Jeffrey Epstein’s home on El Brillo Way. Inside thehouse, an employee is on the phone with Epstein. They ask him, politely, to hangup. Then, guns drawn, they walk up the winding stairs to the home’s secondstory.Detective Recarey remains outside and reads the warrant, out loud, to Epstein’shouseman while another officer videotapes them.“This is your copy,” Recarey says as he hands over the warrant. “When we areconcluded, I will leave a list of what items we’ve taken, okay? I would ask thatyou don’t answer your telephone. I know that the gentleman was having aconversation with Mr. Epstein at the time. So I’m sure he’s trying to call andfind out what’s going on. He will be told what was going on as soon as we’redone. Okay?”Inside the house, detectives see the pink-and-green couch that Mary and othergirls had described. They see photos of naked young girls—in some cases, girlsthey’ve spoken to about Epstein. They also find message pads on which arewritten first names, dates, and numbers for the girls.Sometimes there are notes to go with the names and numbers: “I have girls forhim.” Or “I have 2 girls for him.”These notes are signed by one Sarah Kellen.Epstein’s house has a strangely antiseptic quality. Some of the bedrooms lookalmost like doctors’ offices. In the bathroom off Epstein’s bedroom, there’s amassage table as well as stands holding strange machines, which looked likesomething you’d find in a dermatologist’s office.In a wood-colored armoire beside Epstein’s bed, they see a bottle ofpeach-flavored Joy Jelly. In the bathroom, there are soaps shaped like penisesand vaginas, bottles of Mango Mist, more Joy Jelly, and boxes of tampons.The officers find stacks of UFC videos and DVDs of Rock Star and other B-listmovies.They also find receipts for books bought on Amazon, such as SlaveCraft: Roadmapsfor Erotic Servitude.On the first floor, detectives are drawn to two secret cameras hidden in clocks.On the computer hard drive, they see several photographs of Wendy and othergirls. These images appear to come from the camera inside the clock behindEpstein’s desk.The officers know where the cameras are because they helped install them—in2004, when Epstein complained that someone had stolen a gun and $2,700 from him.Detective Recarey had investigated that case. But before he could arrestEpstein’s handyman, Juan Alessi, for the theft, Epstein contacted a captain inthe Palm Beach PD and prevailed upon him to have the investigation called off.Epstein had met Alessi at a luncheonette, he explained, and Alessi had agreed topay back the money. At the time, it made no sense to prosecute: Epstein was abusy man. He was going to get his money. But he did invite the police into hishome to install the cameras. This was a service that the Palm Beach PD provided(though Epstein would be the only one with access to the footage). But whilethey were there, the police had noticed a group of attractive young women whoseemed to be camped out at the house.The group included Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova.None of the girls was a relative of Epstein—that fact had caught the cops’attention.And now, as the search continues, the cops see photographs of the very samegirls.On Epstein’s desk, the officers find Alison’s high school transcript.The thing is, the detectives can’t shake the feeling that the Epstein house hasbeen tidied up for their arrival. Shelves look as though they’ve been emptied,and several photographs appear to have been removed from the walls.“[Judging] by the condition of the place to be searched,” Chief Reiter will sayin his deposition for B.B. vs. Epstein, “someone probably had cleaned it up abit.”Maybe there’s nothing too surprising about this. After all, Reiter’s team knowsthat Epstein’s gotten wind of their investigation. What is surprising is thatfor a house that’s been scrubbed, there’s so much left lying around.In fact, the oddest thing about the search is that someone appears to have gonethrough the house, gotten rid of incriminating materials, but left many cluesbehind.It was as if the things the police were seeing didn’t even register as wrong.There’s another feeling the cops can’t shake: the nagging sense that theythemselves are being investigated and tailed.First Reiter hears through the grapevine that Epstein’s lawyers have hiredprivate investigators to perform background checks.A public-records demand has been filed in an effort to obtain Reiter’s ownrecords.Detective Recarey tells Reiter that he, too, is being surveilled and that histrash has been picked through.In his entire career as a police officer, this is the first time that Reiter’sseen or heard of such a thing: a suspect investigating his investigators. Butfor the moment, he puts it aside. Recarey’s doing great work on theinvestigation. He’s deeply invested, and for good reason: the detective’s gotfour kids of his own. Right now, more victims are coming out of the woodwork.And now that the warrant’s been executed, there’s no downside to interviewingEpstein’s servants."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter019]Detective Recarey, Probable-Cause Affidavit: May 2006On November 21, 2005 I interviewed Jose [sic] Alessi, a former houseman forJeffrey Epstein. Alessi stated he was employed for eleven years with Mr.Epstein, from approximately 1993 through 2004. Alessi stated he was the housemanager, driver and house maintenance person. It was his responsibility toprepare the house for Epstein’s arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants,Alessi stated they traveled with Epstein on his private plane. I asked Mr.Alessi about the massages that have occurred at Epstein’s home. Alessi statedEpstein receives three massages a day. Each masseuse that visited the house wasdifferent. Alessi stated that towards the end of his employment, the masseuseswere younger and younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi stated they appearedto be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would occur inEpstein’s bedroom or bathroom. He knew this because he often set up the massagetables. I asked if there were things going on other than a massage. Alessistated that there were times towards the end of his employment that he wouldhave to wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis, which were in thesink after the massage. Additionally, he stated the bed would almost always haveto be made after the massage.On January 4, 2006 I interviewed another former houseman, Mr. Alfredo Rodriguez.During a sworn taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by JeffreyEpstein for approximately six months, from November 2004 through May of 2005.His responsibilities as house manager included being the butler, chauffeur,chef, houseman [and to] run errands for Epstein and provide for Epstein’sguests. I asked Rodriguez about masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez statedEpstein would have two massages a day. Epstein would have one massage in themorning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. Rodriguezstated he would be informed to expect someone and make them comfortable untileither Sarah Kellen or Epstein would meet with them. Rodriguez stated once themasseuses would arrive, he would allow them entry into the kitchen area andoffer them something to drink or eat. They would then be encountered by eitherSarah Kellen or Epstein. They would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. Iasked Rodriguez if any of the masseuses appeared young in age. Rodriguez statedthe girls that would come appeared to be too young to be masseuses. He statedone time under Epstein’s direction, he delivered a dozen roses to [Mary’s highschool] for one of the girls that came to provide a massage. He knew the girlswere still in high school and were of high school age. I asked Rodriguez aboutthe massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages.He would often clean Mr. Epstein’s bedroom after the alleged massages and woulddiscover massagers/vibrators and sex toys scattered on the floor. He also saidhe would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put them away in an armoire.He described the armoire as a small wood armoire which was on the wall close toEpstein’s bed. On one occasion Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollarrent a car and rent a car for the same girl he brought the roses to, so that shecould drive her self to Epstein’s house without incident. Rodriguez said thegirl always needed rides to and from the house.Rodriguez produced a green folder which contained documents, and a note with Mr.Epstein’s stationery with direction to deliver a bucket of roses to [Mary’s]High School after [a] high school drama performance….During the course of the investigation, subpoenas were obtained for cell phoneand home phone records from several victims and witnesses along with the cellphone records of Sarah Kellen. An analysis of these records was conducted whichfound numerous telephone calls were made between Sarah Kellen and the victims.These records indicate the dates the calls were made are consistent with thedates and times the victims/witnesses stated they were contacted. Specifically,the phone records showed Kellen called [Wendy Dobbs] during the exact times anddates when [name redacted] advised the incident occurred. Kellen alsocoordinated the encounters with [name redacted] during the time frame the girlsstated they occurred.Pursuant to a lawful subpoena I obtained Epstein’s private plane records for2005 from Jet Aviation. The plane records show arrival and departure ofEpstein’s plane at Palm Beach International airport. These records were comparedto the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen. This comparison found that all thephone calls Kellen made to [Dobbs] and the victims were made in the days justprior to their arrival or during the time Epstein was in Palm Beach.Therefore, as Jeffrey Epstein, who at the time of these incidents was fifty oneyears of age, did have vaginal intercourse either with his penis or digitallywith [names redacted], who were minors at the time this occurred, there issufficient probable cause to charge Jeffrey Epstein with four counts of UnlawfulSexual Activity with a Minor, in violation of Florida State Statute 794.05(1), asecond degree felony. As Epstein, who at the time of the incident was fifty twoyears of age, did use a vibrator on the external vaginal area of [nameredacted], a fourteen year old minor, there is sufficient probable cause tocharge him with Lewd and Lascivious Molestation, in violation of Florida StateStatute 800.04 (5), a second degree felony."},{"pageContent":"PART II [part0123.xhtml#toc-part002]THE MAN [part0123.xhtml#toc-part002]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter020]Jeffrey Epstein: 1953–1969Jeffrey Epstein’s mother, Paula, was the daughter of Max and Lena Stolofsky, whoarrived in the United States as Lithuanian refugees. Relatives on that side ofthe family who remained in the old country would all perish in the course ofAdolf Hitler’s campaign to exterminate European Jewry.Epstein’s father, Seymour, was a manual laborer, like his father before him.Seymour’s parents, Julius and Bessie Epstein, had emigrated from Russia andlanded in Brooklyn, both of them with eighth-grade educations. They lived inCrown Heights, where Julius owned a house-wrecking company.Before landing a job with the city, Seymour had worked with his father.They were kind people, says Epstein’s childhood friend Gary Grossberg. Seymourwas there for him at a difficult time, Grossberg says. When Grossberg was young,his parents divorced, and his father moved out of Brooklyn. Seymour and Paulatook Gary in. Often they referred to him as their third son. “Paula was awonderful mother and homemaker,” Grossberg remembers, “despite the fact that shehad a full-time job.”Epstein, as a kid, was “chubby, with curly hair and a high, ‘hee-hee’ kind oflaugh,” Beverly Donatelli recalls.* [part0121.xhtml#Footnote_66084] Beverly wastwo years older than Epstein, but thanks to his precocious talents, whichallowed him to skip two grades, they graduated from Brooklyn’s Lafayette HighSchool together, in 1969.“He was advanced,” Beverly remembers. “He tutored my girlfriend and myself inthe summer. He taught me geometry in just two months.”When Beverly thinks of Epstein now, she recalls gentler times—long strolls downthe Coney Island boardwalk, roller-coaster rides, stolen kisses. “That last yearin school, I think he kind of loved me,” she says. “One night on the beach hekissed me. In fact, our history teacher made up a mock wedding invitation forJeffrey and myself to show to the class. That seems pretty inappropriate now.But back then, we all thought it was funny. Jews and the Italians, that waspretty much who went to Lafayette High School. They didn’t socialize that much.And though my mother was crazy about him, she told me Jewish boys don’t marryItalians.”Through the haze of several decades, Beverly remembers Epstein as a kindheartedboy and something of a prodigy—a gifted young pianist as well as a math whiz.“I was talking to my girlfriends the other day,” she says. “There is nothing butnice we can say about him. He is actually the reason I went to college.”Beverly lost contact with Epstein over the years. But not long after Epstein’sfiftieth birthday, she got a call out of the blue.“He had a photo of us on the beach,” she says. “A friend noticed it at hisbirthday party. And Jeffrey said to the friend: ‘I bet she has a big ass now.’So Jeffrey called me and invited me to his home on 71st Street. We hung out. Wereminisced. He was the same Jeffrey. A gentleman.”The two never did speak again, but to this day Beverly sympathizes with her highschool sweetheart.“I feel so bad for him,” Beverly says. “That’s how much I liked him.”Gary Grossberg was a year younger than Epstein and in the same class asEpstein’s kid brother, Mark, with whom Grossberg remains very friendly, thoughhe hasn’t seen or spoken with Jeffrey in some time. Both brothers are goodpeople, he says.“Jeffrey’s a brilliant and good person. He is also incredibly generous.”Grossberg says he’s talked to Epstein about “the problem in Florida.” As he seesit, Epstein “got carried away…perhaps he was hanging around with the wrongpeople.”Grossberg wonders, too, if the things that made Epstein special contributed tohis eventual fall from grace.“He was a diamond in the rough, you see,” Grossberg explains. “People recognizedJeffrey’s brilliance very early on. But he had a gift for recognizingopportunities very quickly. He started buying properties in Manhattan, including301 East 66th Street. He asked his brother—did Mark want to join him? He did.”Grossberg himself has had his ups and downs. At one point, he worked in abuilding owned by the Epstein brothers. There, he says, a porter told him astory about a little-known side of Jeffrey Epstein. The porter’s wife, who livedin South America, desperately needed an organ transplant. Epstein paid for theoperation.“That’s just typical,” Grossberg says. “That’s who he always was, long as I knewhim.”“Lafayette was a city school,” says another old classmate, James Rosen. “It wasfunctional. There was nothing special about it.”James Rosen is a retired postal worker. He lives in South Florida now, but, likeJeffrey Epstein, he’d grown up in Sea Gate.“There was a lot of volatility at Lafayette,” Rosen recalls. “It was ablue-collar area that was, at one time, 90 percent Italian. Then a small amountof Jews moved in, and there was anti-Semitism. The Italians didn’t want the Jewsto be there.”Black families were moving in, too, he remembers, and Hispanic ones. But he saysmost of the animosity was aimed at Jews.“There were fights in the schools. They thought we were going to take over.”But Epstein seems to have made friends easily. Even then, his buddies—who calledhim Eppy—could see he was special. While they hung out on the beach, Epsteinplayed the piano. Did homework. Worked on his prized stamp collection.Innocent times."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter021]Jeffrey Epstein: 1969–1976It’s the height of the Vietnam War. Students collide with collegeadministrators. Hippies collide with hard hats. Kids with long hair collide withtheir parents. Jeffrey Epstein does not go in for any of that. At the age ofsixteen, he’s taking advanced math classes at Cooper Union, an augustinstitution in the East Village where Abraham Lincoln once spoke.Thanks to a generous endowment, the school is tuition-free, though theapplication process is famously rigorous.Epstein sails through it.At Harvard or Yale, his accent would give him away. Epstein tawks like theBrooklyn boy he is. But Cooper Union is more open than any Ivy League school.It’s full of boys from Brooklyn, and, aside from his prodigious intellect,Epstein doesn’t stand out. He starts to make money by tutoring his fellowstudents. And in 1971, he leaves Cooper Union for the greener pastures of NewYork University, located a few blocks away. There, at the Courant Institute ofMathematical Sciences, he studies the mathematical physiology of the heart. Buthe never graduates from any college or university.By 1973, Epstein is teaching at the Dalton School, a prestigious private schoolon the Upper East Side. Like Tavern on the Green, Grand Central Terminal, andthe Century Association, Dalton is a New York institution—an elite K–12 rocketship built for the children of New York’s ruling classes.It’s not at all clear how Epstein, who has no college degree, ends up there.And yet here he is, barely out of his teens and already a teacher of math andphysics. “Go forth unafraid” is the Dalton School’s credo.It’s a philosophy Epstein has adopted. For him, Dalton’s an excellent launchingpad.It’s nothing like Lafayette High School. The kids he’s teaching are rich—veryrich. Their parents are extremely well connected. And despite Epstein’souter-borough accent, he’s careful in his presentation. At any given moment,he’s one parent-teacher conference away from a whole new world of possibilities.Because Dalton has an excellent student-to-teacher ratio, the parents get toknow Epstein quite well. Before long, a Wall Street macher named Alan “Ace”Greenberg has taken a special shine to the young man who’s been tutoring his sonTed.Like Epstein, Ace Greenberg came from a humble background.The son of an Oklahoma City shopkeeper, he won a football scholarship to theUniversity of Oklahoma, transferred to the University of Missouri following aback injury, and graduated in 1949. That same year, he moved to New York and,after a series of rejections at white-shoe firms—places that never would hire aJew—landed a job at Bear Stearns, earning $32.50 a week as a clerk.By 1958, he’d been made a full partner. Built like a pit bull, Greenberg smokedcigars, performed coin tricks for his friends, and always dressed in a bow tie.He was an all-elbows trader—gruff, cheap, and, above all, impatient. He was alsoa champion bridge player, a hunter of big game in Africa, and the firm but loyalleader of the team he’d built at Bear Stearns—an unusual team made up mostly ofmen who’d grown up in New York’s outer boroughs.Greenberg didn’t care about MBAs or Ivy League diplomas. What he cared about wasraw talent and drive. Greenberg cultivated risk takers, unconventional thinkers,and he looked high (and especially low) for his “PSDs”: men who, in hisestimation, were poor, smart, and, above all, determined.Jeffrey Epstein, the Dalton School teacher, fit Greenberg’s bill perfectly."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 22 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter022]Jeffrey Epstein: 1976–1981According to several published reports, it was Ace Greenberg’s son, Ted, whointroduced Epstein to Greenberg. But other sources say Greenberg’s daughter,Lynne, was dating Epstein at the time. According to them, that was how Epsteingot into Bear Stearns—by charming a young and beautiful woman and using her toadvance his career.At Bear Stearns, Epstein started as an assistant to a trader on the AmericanStock Exchange and quickly worked up to junior partner, which meant that he wasentitled to a share of the profits. Still in his twenties, he was running withthe bulls, kicking down any doors that stood in his way.The view from Ace Greenberg’s office, high above Madison Avenue in midtown, wasstriking. At night, the whole city was lit up like a stage set.It was Epstein’s city now, to win or to lose. And there were women to go withthe prize. Tall, beautiful women, blondes and brunettes, who wouldn’t have givena math teacher the time of day. Now they found Epstein exciting and handsome.Greenberg’s gorgeous assistant was one of these women.If Greenberg knew about their affair, he did not seem to care. Then again,Greenberg had other things on his mind. The Reagan era, when deregulation kickedinto high gear, was still on the horizon. But there was already a decreasingamount of government oversight on Wall Street, and a new breed of bare-knuckletraders had begun to push every available limit. It was the start of the age ofcorporate raiders, and with Ace Greenberg looking out for him, Epstein had noreservations when it came to throwing his weight around. The golden boy’s giftfor working the numbers earned him a place in the special-products division,where he worked on extremely complex tax-related problems for a select group ofBear Stearns’s wealthiest clients—an elite within the elite—including SeagramCEO Edgar Bronfman.In the spring of 1981 Bronfman made a bid to take over the St. Joe MineralsCorporation. He offered forty-five dollars a share, or close to three times thevalue of St. Joe’s stock. The whole offer amounted to $2.1 billion in cash.But St. Joe’s executives didn’t want to sell their 118-year-old company. In apress release, they called Seagram’s bid unsolicited and dismissed it as“grossly inadequate.” At which point the SEC decided to investigate.There were allegations of insider trading. Within a few weeks, Bear Stearns’semployees were called in to testify.Epstein got called in as well and categorically denied any wrongdoing.But, as it turned out, he’d just resigned from Bear Stearns."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter023]Jeffrey Epstein: 1981Epstein will always maintain that his resignation had nothing to do with theSEC’s investigation into Bear Stearns and Edgar Bronfman’s ill-fated attempt totake over St. Joe’s.But of course this raises the question: Why did Epstein resign from BearStearns?In his testimony before the SEC, Epstein says he was offended by the company’sinvestigation of a twenty-thousand-dollar loan he’d made to his friend WarrenEisenstein. Epstein didn’t know it at the time, he maintains, but if used to buystock, such a loan might have been unethical, if not illegal.On top of that, questions about Epstein’s expenses had come up.In the end, Bear Stearns fined him $2,500—an embarrassing thing, to be sure. Somuch for making full partner anytime soon.But $2,500 is not $250,000 or even $25,000. Who’d give up a job as juniorpartner over that?Another one of Epstein’s bosses, James “Jimmy” Cayne, will say, “Jeffrey Epsteinleft Bear of his own volition.” Epstein wanted to strike out on his own, Cayneexplains. But given the timing, some questions remain. Then there’s Epstein’sown testimony, given on April 1, 1981, before SEC investigators Jonathan Harrisand Robert Blackburn:Q:Sir, are you aware that certain rumors may have been circulating around yourfirm in connection with your reasons for leaving the firm?A:I’m aware that there were many rumors.Q:What rumors have you heard?A:Nothing to do with St. Joe.Q:Can you relate what you heard?A:It was having to do with an illicit affair with a secretary.As far as the investigators are concerned, this is new information; the firsttime a secretary’s name has come up. But they have no interest in Epstein’soffice romance and press on:Q:Mr. Epstein, did anyone at Bear Stearns tell you in words or substance thatyou should not divulge anything about St. Joe Minerals to the staff of theSecurities and Exchange Commission? Has anyone indicated to you in any way,either directly or indirectly, in words or substance, that your compensation forthis past year or any future monies coming to you from Bear Stearns will becontingent upon your not divulging information to the Securities and ExchangeCommission?A:No.Whatever the reasons for his resignation, Epstein still gets his annual bonus ofaround $100,000 (roughly $275,000 in today’s dollars). The SEC never bringscharges against him or any other Bear Stearns employee. And so the particularsof Epstein’s departure get folded up into the greater mystery surrounding theman. Did Epstein crash the rocket ship that Ace Greenberg had given him topilot? Or did he take it and fly it out, over the horizon?Either way, Epstein was out on his own.For him, the future would only get brighter."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter024]Ana Obregón: 1982Ana Obregón was one of the world’s most beautiful women and well on her way tobecoming famous as such when she first met Jeffrey Epstein. For her, there wouldbe film roles—in the 1984 Bo Derek vehicle Bolero, Ana Obregón gives the star arun for her money—and appearances on the covers of Spanish Playboy and SpanishVanity Fair.As for fortune, Obregón had that already.Ana’s father was a very wealthy investor in Spain. But he also had seriousproblems. On June 15, 1982, a venerable stock- and bond-trading firm, theDrysdale Securities Corporation, announced that it was going out of business.Just that year, Drysdale had spun off a subsidiary operation called DrysdaleGovernment Securities. And in May, DGS defaulted on $160 million in interestpayments it owed on Treasury securities that it had borrowed. In doing so, DGShad dragged down its parent company.A very well-connected group of Spanish families—including members of Spain’sroyal family—had invested with Drysdale. Those investors stood to lose hundredsof millions of dollars. And Ana’s father was one of those investors.What Ana wanted from Jeffrey Epstein was help in recovering her father’s money.“My father, he’s done something stupid,” she told him.A Spanish accent. A Brooklyn accent. They blended well together, and Ana was sovery lovely.It turned out that Epstein was willing to help.“Something stupid, you see, with the money. The family money. Some—what do youcall it? A scheme. He knew some of the people, but they lied to him. And now themoney is gone.”People who knew Jeffrey Epstein recall that he was bad off after his exit orouster—whatever it was—from Bear Stearns. Moving from couch to couch for awhile. Sleeping in his lawyer’s offices before settling down in an apartment inthe Solow Tower, on East 66th Street.It’s a bit hard to believe. After all, Epstein left Bear Stearns with a gooddeal of money. But Epstein’s lifestyle was expensive. He was a man on the makethen, and Ana was still in her twenties, plying her craft at the ActorsStudio—the New York City theater institution that Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro,Jack Nicholson, and Jane Fonda had all been members of.Epstein told Ana that he’d formed a company, International Assets Group.To Ana, this sounded very impressive. In fact, IAG was a small operation thatEpstein was running out of his apartment. But if Ana had known that, would shehave cared? She could already see that Epstein was brilliant. And though shewould maintain that their friendship was strictly platonic, it was Ana whohelped set Epstein on his course. Like other beautiful women he’d cultivatethroughout his life, she opened doors to whole other kingdoms.Ones that no boys from Brooklyn had even dreamed of.Andrew Levander was an assistant US attorney in the Southern District of NewYork’s Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force. He was assigned to look intoDrysdale’s collapse. The case he was building would result in fraud convictionsfor a number of Drysdale executives, and even today, Levander remembers Epsteinbringing “a very attractive woman” to meet him when Epstein came to him in thecourse of the investigation.The woman was Ana Obregón.Levander told Ana that he was already working the case. A lawyer named RobertGold, who was a former federal prosecutor himself, was assisting. And nowEpstein would join them in the hunt for the monies.In effect, DGS had built a series of labyrinths, rabbit holes, deadfalls. Andeven investors who’d lost vast sums to the company were less than forthcomingwhen it came to speaking to the US attorney. Several of the investors wereforeign. Some had violated their own countries’ laws pertaining to foreigninvestments.This was where Epstein—with his calm, confident air of discretion—came in.Ana Obregón gave Epstein power of attorney over any monies that he recovered.And though it took him three years, working with Robert Gold and the USattorney’s office, Epstein finally did make his way to the center of DGS’s mazeand recover Obregón’s money.Most of it was being held in a bank in the Cayman Islands.Epstein’s agreement with Ana prevents us from knowing how much he recovered—andhow much he kept. But given the amounts at stake, Epstein likely earnedmillions—or more—and to this day Ana Obregón has nothing but appreciation forwhat Epstein accomplished.“I know he’s had some problems,” she says. “I don’t want anything to do withthat.”As for Epstein, he came out of the deal with a new modus operandi: from now on,he’d only work with the super rich."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter025]Eva Andersson: July 8, 1980Miss Sweden, Eva Birgitta Andersson, is wearing a dazzling white gown andsweating, ever so slightly, under the stage lights. But Bob Barker’s about toannounce the winner of this, the twenty-ninth Miss Universe pageant, held inSeoul, South Korea, and Eva’s smile is as wide as the ocean.“And now that we know what Miss Universe will win, let’s see which five girlsare still in the running!”Barker pauses, like the expert broadcaster he is. Eva’s chest tightens. Thereare twelve women on stage, all of them beautiful—even if they’re not quite asbeautiful as Miss Sweden.“On this card are the names of five contestants who have received the highesttotal score from our judges in the personal interview, the swimsuit, and theevening gown competition.”Eva feels the camera pan across the stage—pan across her, standing in betweenMiss Scotland and Miss Puerto Rico.“As a result, they will be our five finalists. As I call each name, you will seea figure on your television screen. That is the total score received by thecontestant since she became a semifinalist. But one thing I would point out toyou: the point total is not necessarily a sign of who our eventual winner willbe. Being first now is no guarantee of being first at the time of our judges’final ballot.”Oh, get on with it, Miss Sweden thinks. And, as if by her command, Bob Barkerdoes.“Now our five finalists. Good luck, girls! The first finalist is: Miss Sweden!”Eva’s hands fly up to her face. The time it takes her to walk to the front ofthe stage is all the time she needs to stop herself from crying.For Eva, it’s not meant to be. Miss USA, Shawn Weatherly, wins that year’scompetition—she’ll go on to become a star on Baywatch. But Eva’s future issecure nonetheless. After the pageant, she’ll spend three years studying inStockholm, finish med school at UCLA, and become a doctor of internal medicine.Along the way, she’ll meet Jeffrey Epstein.People who knew them when they were a couple say that Eva wanted to marryEpstein. One friend says he considered it seriously. In the end, Eva ended upwith a man named Glenn Dubin, though she and Epstein remained very close. And ifEva was the proverbial “one who got away,” Epstein ended up dating otherimpressive women—world-class beauties—as he made his way in the world.Why didn’t any of the romances take? Perhaps there was always someone morefabulous waiting for Epstein around the corner. Perhaps none of these womensatisfied Epstein’s deeper urges. But he did have a knack for keeping the womenhe’d dated by his side through thick and thin, long after he’d broken up withthem.When he was through with his girlfriends, Epstein would say, they graduated up,not down, the ladder, moving from the status of “lover” to “friend.”In his estimation, these shifts always constituted a promotion.The world was full of beautiful women. But for Epstein, friendship seemed to bea far more precious commodity."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter026]Jeffrey Epstein: 1984How did Jeffrey Epstein make all his money?Epstein would tell stories over the years about monies recovered from slipperycharacters. Sometimes, friends and former associates would say, he’d suggest hehad ties to the government, giving listeners the impression that he was doingdangerous, glamorous work.Others said that what Epstein really did, at this stage in his career, was muchmore banal. According to them, Epstein spent most of his time coming up withcreative new ways for the rich to avoid paying taxes. The commission fortax-avoidance deals was enormous, although the number of deals Epstein wasinvolved with is a matter of conjecture, as is his record of successes andfailures.But Epstein’s business model was evolving. He’d charge a flat fee. No fancymath. No percentages.Pay me fifty million dollars. Or pay the IRS seven times that amount.At first Epstein did not demand his fee up front. Instead he asked that thepayment—often a substantial one—be put into escrow. If his strategy worked, he’dget paid. If not, the money bounced back to the client.In the eighties, when tax rates on the top 1 percent were much, much higher thanthey are today, topping out at close to 50 percent, it was an extremelyeffective pitch. And then there were other ways to make money.In 1982, Epstein sold his wealthy friends, his friends’ wealthy relatives, andothers on an oil-drilling deal. One of the investors, Michael Stroll, had runWilliams Electronics, an entertainment company known for the pinball machines itmade.Stroll put $450,000 into the oil deal.But in 1984, Michael Stroll wanted his money back. Despite repeated demands andrequests for a full accounting of what Epstein owed him, he got $10,000 back onhis $450,000 investment. Eventually he sued Epstein in federal court for theremaining $440,000—the case went on for a number of years. In court, Epsteintold the judge that the $10,000 he’d returned was actually the payment for ahorse Stroll had sold him.Like many cases involving Epstein, this one was settled out of court, the termsof the final agreement kept secret."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter027]Steven Hoffenberg: July 10, 1987Before there was Bernie Madoff, there was Steven Hoffenberg.In 1987, Hoffenberg was the head of Towers Financial Corporation, a company thatbought debts, such as unpaid medical bills, at a very steep discount whilepressing the debtors to repay in full. He’d started the company fifteen yearsearlier with two thousand dollars and just a handful of employees. Thanks, inpart, to a grueling work ethic, he’d turned that into a much bigger concern,with twelve hundred employees and stock that traded over the counter. ButHoffenberg still spent fifteen hours each day, six days a week, in his office.He wanted more. Hoffenberg was a Wall Street outsider. A Brooklyn boy. A collegedropout, like Epstein.One thing Hoffenberg wanted was respect. The other was someone who was familiarwith Wall Street’s inner workings. Jeffrey Epstein, who had traded options forBear Stearns, fit the bill.Hoffenberg began paying twenty-five thousand dollars per month for Epstein’sexpertise as a consultant.The SEC had already looked into Hoffenberg’s affairs, settling with him out ofcourt in a matter relating to unregistered securities. But Hoffenberg wasdangling a very big prize.In the 1980s, several major financial players were involved in the greenmailingof publicly traded companies. What greenmailing means, in practice, is that abrokerage house or group of investors will start buying shares in companies thatseem to be vulnerable to takeover attempts. To ward off the attempts, executivesat those companies will buy the shares back at a premium. It’s risky, but veryoften the investors stand to make a handsome profit.Yet another thing Hoffenberg wanted was to take over Pan American World Airways.The iconic airline had already entered its downward trajectory, but it was stilla giant.For Hoffenberg, the greenmailing profits could have been huge.According to Hoffenberg, Epstein handled the attempted takeover of Pan Am—a dealthat went sideways almost immediately.Steven Hoffenberg still has a lot to say on the subject. But in listening tohim, one must bear in mind that in 1995, he pleaded guilty to criminalconspiracy and fraud charges involving a $460 million swindle, a familiar schemeto anyone who followed the Bernie Madoff case.Like so many others, Hoffenberg had tried to fly very high without the necessaryupdraft. And despite all the hours he spent at the office, he’d also developed ataste for the high life. He bought his own jet, a luxury yacht, and a LongIsland mansion to go with his expensive Manhattan apartment. He’d also brieflyowned a controlling interest in the New York Post.To cover his tracks, Hoffenberg had been taking money from investors and usingit to pay previous investors. It was a classic Ponzi scheme—one of the biggestin history—and Hoffenberg ended up spending nineteen years in a federal prison.Why was Epstein not implicated in the case? All that Hoffenberg will say whenasked is: “Ask Robert Gold.”Another source suggests that Gold, the former federal prosecutor who had helpedEpstein recover Ana Obregón’s money, kept the US attorney away from Epsteinuntil there were only a few weeks left before the statute of limitations ranout.As for Epstein himself, he would always deny any wrongdoing. Despite hisproximity to Hoffenberg, he managed to avoid the blast radius."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 28 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter028]Robert Meister: 1985Robert Meister, the vice chairman of a giant insurance brokerage and consultingfirm called Aon, met Jeffrey Epstein in the mid-eighties, aboard a flight fromNew York to Palm Beach. Both men were flying first class. Each one thought theother looked familiar. They talked in the course of that flight, and Meisterfiled the conversation away, only to recall it in 1989. At that time, LesWexner, who was Meister’s friend and a client of Meister’s insurance company,was complaining to him about the people managing his money.Wexner was a billionaire, but for all his wealth, his finances were in a tangle.Maybe Epstein could help. And perhaps Epstein would also be grateful for theintroduction. Hard as it is to believe, there’s evidence to suggest that Epsteinreally had spent the last of his last Bear Stearns bonus—along with his share ofthe money he’d recovered for Ana Obregón—and was broke, again, at the time.One estranged friend says that he had to loan Epstein money to pay the bill atEpstein’s garage, which had seized Epstein’s car for nonpayment.Another estranged friend says that Epstein didn’t have two nickels to rubtogether.Diana Crane, a former model, says that Epstein always had first-class upgradeshe would give to his friends so they didn’t have to fly economy class.“No one knew where or how he got them,” Crane recalls. “Sometimes they worked,and other times they didn’t. I remember he saw a friend of mine wearing aConcorde jacket. He asked if he could borrow it for a day or so. My friend nevergot the jacket back. But Epstein would tell people he always flew on theConcorde—a total lie.”But even if Epstein were flush, Les Wexner would have been a big fish to catch.From the get-go, Meister’s wife, Wendy, had her suspicions about Epstein. Aboutthe way he presented himself and the way he worked himself into their innercircle.Before long, Wendy was calling Epstein the virus.But for Epstein, the Meisters weren’t the point. Wexner was.And hard as it is to understand why the billionaire would associate with a manwho’d worked with a Ponzi king like Steven Hoffenberg, it turned out that Wexnerand Epstein would get along perfectly well."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter029]Ghislaine Maxwell: 1991Robert Meister was not the only friend who helped Jeffrey Epstein, the boy fromConey Island, on his way up the social ladder. There was also Ghislaine Maxwell,a wealthy heiress from the United Kingdom who’d retained her ties to some of theworld’s most glamorous and scandalous jet-setters.Maxwell was the youngest and most favored child of one of the most famous—eveninfamous—men in Europe. Her father, Robert Maxwell, was a Czech refugee who hadfought in the French Foreign Legion and with the British in World War II and hadgone on to become a member of Parliament. By the 1960s, he’d become a mediabaron. Born into a Hasidic family—his birth name was Ján Ludvík Hyman BinyaminHoch—Maxwell died in disgrace in 1991 after falling or perhaps jumping off theside of his supersize yacht, the Lady Ghislaine.“The shtetl Solotvyno, where I come from, it is no more,” Maxwell said a fewmonths before his demise. “It was poor. It was Orthodox. And it was Jewish. Wewere very poor. We didn’t have things that other people had. They had shoes,they had food, and we didn’t. At the end of the war, I discovered the fate of myparents and my sisters and brothers, relatives, and neighbors. I don’t know whatwent through their minds as they realized that they’d been tricked into a gaschamber.”Maxwell’s own death was followed by an international scandal. It turned out thathe’d stolen hundreds of millions of pounds from his companies’ pension funds andused them to prop up his empire. Two of his sons were tried for conspiracy tocommit fraud and ultimately exonerated. But Ghislaine, who had grown up inluxurious surroundings and counted the Duke of York, Prince Andrew, among herintimates, could not escape the dark shadow her father had cast. Looking tostart fresh, she took the Concorde to New York City.At first, it seems, Maxwell and Epstein were lovers. “She was madly in love withJeffrey,” says a longtime friend of Ghislaine’s. Then they became somethingmore. Ghislaine took care of Epstein’s travel arrangements. She managed hishousehold and opened doors that very few Brooklyn-born Jewish boys could havepassed through. According to lawsuits and witness testimony, she also became oneof several women who procured young girls for Epstein.She was not jealous, according to people who knew her back then. If anything,Ghislaine seemed to take pleasure in satisfying Epstein’s needs.Ghislaine introduced Epstein to a fabulous world that the Brooklyn boy knewnothing about. One friend jokes that she taught Epstein the difference between afish fork and a salad fork. But despite—or was it because of?—Maxwell’s devotionto Epstein, she, too, graduated from girlfriend to friend status. According toJane Doe 102 vs. Jeffrey Epstein, a civil complaint filed in 2009 by a womanlater identified as Virginia Roberts, one of the services Maxwell provided forEpstein was the procurement of underage women. (Through her lawyer and in courtpapers, Maxwell has vehemently denied any involvement with Virginia, with anyother young woman Epstein was involved with, or with any criminal activitiescommitted by Jeffrey Epstein. In a 2016 answer to a defamation lawsuit broughtby Roberts, Maxwell called the allegations fabricated for financial gain.)The case of Nadia Bjorlin, who was thirteen when she was first noticed byEpstein, raises questions in this regard, at least in the eyes of her mother.Bjorlin’s Iranian-born mother spoke to a British tabloid some years ago abouther family’s disturbing experience with Maxwell and Epstein. Bjorlin’s father, acelebrated conductor of classical music, had died a year earlier, the mothersaid. She believed that this made the girl a vulnerable and easy target.“She was at school at the famed Interlochen Arts Center, in Michigan, when shemet Epstein,” the mother said.“My daughter was a singer. She was a baby. She was a skinny little girl, notmature for her age. She was thirteen, but everyone thought she was nine or ten.“Epstein was a big donor, and he heard about Nadia and that her father had died,so she was vulnerable, and he contacted her. He said, ‘Here’s my number.’“He kept saying, ‘Come—will you come?’ He said he wanted to help mentor her. Iwouldn’t let her meet him. What sort of a man approaches a young girl and asksto meet her?”In the meantime, Maxwell had become friendly with the family. “I trustedGhislaine; she was like a mother,” Bjorlin’s mother recalled. “She was alwayscalling my house.“Ghislaine didn’t want me to meet Epstein, but I did anyway, and I asked what hewanted with Nadia. He said he wanted to help her singing career. He said, ‘I’dlike to be like a godfather.’ It felt creepy.“I had a bad vibe about him and said, ‘Stop!’ I told him, ‘No, thank you. Shedoesn’t need your help.’ I kept Nadia away from him. She never met him alone.She never went anywhere with him.”Despite her suspicions, it took Epstein’s arrest to make Bjorlin’s mother wonderwhether Maxwell and Epstein hadn’t been sizing her daughter up for his stable ofunderage women."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter030]Leslie Wexner: 1993Leslie Wexner, the richest man in Ohio, is a proud midwesterner. Born into therag trade (Wexner’s parents were Russian-Jewish immigrants), he grew up to be astraight shooter—taciturn and camera-shy.For several years running, his 315-foot boat, the Limitless, was the largestyacht owned by an American.Wexner’s employees loved him, and he was known to be fiercely loyal to them.In time, he’d come to see the same qualities in Jeffrey Epstein.“Everyone was mystified as to what [Epstein’s] appeal was,” says Robert Morosky,a former vice chairman of the clothing retailer the Limited, founded by Wexner.“Almost everyone at the Limited wondered who he was,” another former employee ofWexner’s recalls. “He literally came out of nowhere.”But it seems that Epstein did work hard to untangle Wexner’s finances. And itappears he succeeded. “Jeffrey cleaned that up right away,” a former associateof Epstein’s says.The two men became all but inseparable.“Very smart, with a combination of excellent judgment and unusually highstandards,” Wexner said of Epstein at the time. “Also, he is always a most loyalfriend.”When Wexner wanted to break up with a woman he’d been dating for several years—awoman who moved to Ohio and converted to Judaism to make him happy—he dispatchedEpstein to do the dirty work.When Wexner hired a decorator for his Ohio mansion and wanted someone to verifythe authenticity of several expensive antiques, Epstein flew in his friendStuart Pivar, the renowned art collector and author. (According to Pivar, mostof the antiques were cheap imitations.) When Wexner traveled abroad, he’d bringback trinkets and gifts for Epstein. When Wexner wanted to see Cats, Epsteinarranged to have the cast perform in his mansion.In Ohio, Wexner’s associates whispered about his relationship with JeffreyEpstein.

It was Epstein whonegotiated the prenuptial agreement and orchestrated its very strange signing.Abigail signed the agreement in her law office. Wexner signed it in his office.According to an associate of Epstein’s who was present, Epstein brought a SportsIllustrated swimsuit model along to Wexner’s office, as if to make the pointthat there are other beautiful women in the world. As a joke, Epstein placed theagreement on the model’s belly and had Wexner sign it right there.Epstein asked his friend: “Are you sure you want to do this?”“Yes, Jeffrey,” said Wexner. “Quite sure.”“It was an uproarious scene,” Epstein’s associate recalls. “Just Jeffrey beingJeffrey.

In fact, like a fox that’s gottenhold of the lease to a henhouse, Epstein, according to evidence collected in alater lawsuit brought by Epstein victims, eventually provided financial supportfor a modeling agency, and provided support for models employed by that agency,in New York City.This story begins with a Frenchman—a playboy modeling agent named Jean-LucBrunel—who was an owner of the Karin modeling agency.Brunel had been working as a modeling agent since the seventies. He claimed tohave launched the careers of Monica Bellucci, Estelle, Jerry Hall, RachelHunter, Milla Jovovich, Rebecca Romijn, Kristina Semenovskaya, Sharon Stone, andEstella Warren, as well as Christy Turlington and other well-known cover girls.Brunel had also been a subject of a 60 Minutes investigation, broadcast in 1988,into sexual exploitation in the modeling industry. That exposé had caused EileenFord of the elite Ford modeling agency to sever her ties with the playboy.(Brunel’s activities were also chronicled in a 1995 book about the fashionindustry—Model: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women, by Michael Gross.)But Brunel’s reputation did not prevent Jeffrey Epstein from getting involved inhis business.According to a summary judgment court filing by Bradley Edwards, a victims’lawyer defending against a lawsuit by Jeffrey Epstein alleging fabrication ofsexual assault cases against him, Epstein had provided support for Brunel’sagency, which changed its name, in 2005, from Karin to MC2—as in E = mc².As a scout for MC2, Brunel traveled the world in search of undiscovered talent,favoring Scandinavia, Israel, central Europe, the former Soviet republics, andSouth America, setting up modeling competitions and negotiating with otherinternational modeling agents and agencies.But according to the court filing, in which Edwards detailed the information hehad gathered in support of victims, Epstein and Brunel had used the agency tobring underage girls from foreign countries into the United States by promisingthem modeling contracts. These girls were then housed in condominiums belongingto Epstein. “Epstein and Brunel would then obtain a visa for these girls,” thedocument states, “then charge the underage girls rent, presumably to live asunderage prostitutes in the condos.”“I strongly deny having participated, neither directly nor indirectly, in theactions Mr. Jeffrey Epstein is being accused of,” Brunel would say. “I stronglydeny having committed any illicit act or any wrongdoing in the course of my workas a scouter or model agencies manager. I have exercised with the utmost ethicalstandard for almost forty years.”According to Brunel, his association with Jeffrey Epstein ended up having astrong negative impact on his reputation and business. Several photographersrefused to work with him. Other agencies, such as Modilinos Model Management,curtailed their relationships with Brunel. And in 2015, Brunel filed his owncivil lawsuit against Jeffrey Epstein, denying that he had any role in Epstein’sillegal activities, alleging that Epstein had obstructed justice by telling himto avoid having his deposition taken in the criminal case the Palm Beach PD hadbuilt against Epstein, and claiming that false allegations of Brunel’s links toEpstein’s activities had harmed his reputation and cost him a great deal ofbusiness.In his filing, Brunel included several e-mails from industry contacts whoexpressed their doubts about placing models with his agency. “Parents don’t wanttheir daughters coming to us because [when] they google your name and the agencyname the only things they see is ‘Sex Trafficking’!!!” one correspondent hadwritten."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 32 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter032]Nadia Marcinkova: circa 2000MC2 has offices in New York City.

And when he comes home to New York he hosts parties where importantpeople—corporate titans, real estate tycoons, university presidents, NobelPrize–winning scientists, princes, ex-presidents, and heads of state—mingle withbeautiful women.Some guests marvel in public: Who are these women? Where do they come from?Nadia Marcinkova comes from Slovakia. She looks like a model. But Nadia’s donevery little modeling, if any. Instead she’s become another of Epstein’sgirlfriends.According to statements given to the Palm Beach police, she’s also served as awilling accomplice in Epstein’s sexual assaults on underage females.Epstein prefers diminutive women, but Nadia is tall. She’s rail-thin and blondlike the sun, with glowing skin, a wide smile, and sky-high cheekbones.On a good day, she could pass for a Bond girl—a woman caught up in a web ofcrime and intrigue. But of course, that’s exactly what she is.In certain circles, the academics and the women in Epstein’s orbit are almost ajoke.

It sits on twenty perfectly manicured acres lessthan two miles away from Jeffrey Epstein’s home on El Brillo Way. It’s home tothe exclusive Mar-a-Lago Club, which has a spa, tennis courts, and a very poshrestaurant.Donald Trump had fought the town council for decades as they blocked all hisefforts to turn the place into a private resort. Other clubs on the island—thosewith a history of excluding blacks and Jews—had never faced such restrictions,Trump had argued. At one point he sent copies of two movies to every member ofthe town council: Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, in which Sidney Poitierconfronts his girlfriend’s racist parents, and Gentleman’s Agreement, in which ajournalist confronts anti-Semitism in Connecticut and New York City.“Whether they love me or not, everyone agrees the greatest and most importantplace in Palm Beach is Mar-a-Lago,” Trump told the Washington Post after winninghis battle. “I took this ultimate place and made it incredible and opened it,essentially, to the people of Palm Beach. The fact that I owned it made it a loteasier to get along with the Palm Beach establishment.”The Breakers hotel, Trump explained, “gets the [island’s] leftovers.”It cost $100,000 to join the club. Members paid $14,000 yearly in dues. Andalthough Epstein had never properly joined the club, Trump’s friendship withGhislaine Maxwell gave Epstein unlimited use of the facilities.This arrangement ended when a member’s young daughter complained to her wealthyfather: while relaxing at Mar-a-Lago, she’d been approached and invited out toEpstein’s house.The girl said that she had gone and that Epstein had tried to get her toundress.The girl’s father had gone directly to Trump, who—in no uncertain terms—toldEpstein that he was barred from Mar-a-Lago.Because no complaint was filed, the police had taken no action. But years later,a woman named Virginia Roberts would say that, as a young girl, she’d had anidentical encounter at Mar-a-Lago.According to a court document Virginia filed in her civil lawsuit againstEpstein, she was a changing-room assistant at Mar-a-Lago, earning about ninedollars an hour, when Ghislaine Maxwell approached her. Maxwell asked Virginiaif she was interested in learning to be a massage therapist—which, it turnedout, she was. Like the other girl, Virginia told her father, who was alsoemployed at Mar-a-Lago as a maintenance manager. But Virginia’s father sawnothing wrong with the offer, and he drove her, later that day, to Epstein’shouse on El Brillo Way.There, according to the document, Maxwell assured Virginia’s father that Ms.Maxwell would provide transportation home for his teenage daughter. Then she ledVirginia upstairs, to a spa room equipped with a shower and a massage table.Jeffrey Epstein was lying, naked, on the table.Virginia was shocked, she says in the filing, but, with no experience withmassages, thought this could be massage therapy protocol. “Ms. Maxwell then tookoff her own shirt and left on her underwear and started rubbing her breastsacross [Jeffrey’s] body, impliedly showing [Virginia] what she was expected todo,” the filing continues. “Ms. Maxwell then told [Virginia] to take off herclothes. The minor girl was apprehensive about doing this, but, in fear,proceeded to follow Ms. Maxwell by removing everything but her underwear. Shewas then ordered to remove her underwear and straddle [Epstein]. The encounterescalated, with [Jeffrey] and Ms. Maxwell sexually assaulting, battering,exploiting, and abusing [Virginia] in various ways and in various locations,including the steam room and the shower. At the end of this sexually exploitiveabuse, [Epstein] and Ms. Maxwell giddily told [Virginia] to return the followingday and told her she had ‘lots of potential.’ [Epstein] paid [Virginia] hundredsof dollars, told her it was for two hours of work, and directed one of heremployees to drive her home.”At the time, Virginia was fifteen years old."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 34 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter034]Declaration of Virginia Roberts Giuffre: January 19, 2015, filed on January 19,2015 by attorneys representing Jeffrey Epstein’s victims1.

But my life took a very different turn whenadults—including Jeffrey Epstein and his close friend Alan Dershowitz—began tobe interested in having sex with me.4. In approximately 1999, when I was 15 years old, I met Ghislaine Maxwell. Sheis the daughter of Robert Maxwell, who had been a wealthy publisher in Britain.Maxwell asked that I come with her to Jeffrey Epstein’s mansion for the purposesof teaching me how to perform “massages” and to train me personally in thatarea. Soon after that I went to Epstein’s home in Palm Beach on El Brillo Way.5. From the first time I was taken to Epstein’s mansion that day, hismotivations and actions were sexual, as were Maxwell’s. My father was notallowed inside. I was brought up some stairs. There was a naked guy, Epstein, onthe table in the room. Epstein and Maxwell forced me into sexual activity withEpstein. I was 15 years old at the time. He seemed to be in his 40s or 50s. Iwas paid $200. I was driven home by one of Epstein’s employees.6. I came back for several days following and did the same sorts of sexualthings for Epstein.7. After I did those things for Epstein, he and Maxwell said they were going tohave me travel and were going to get an education for me. They were promising methe world, that I would travel with Epstein on his private jet and have awell-paid profession. Epstein said he would eventually match me up with awealthy person so that I would be “set up” for life.8. So I started “working” exclusively for Epstein. He took me to New York on hisbig, private jet. We went to his mansion in New York City. I was shown to myroom, a very luxurious room. The mansion was huge. I was very young and I gotscared because it was so big. Epstein brought me to a room with a massageparlor. Epstein made me engage [in] sexual activities with him there.9. You can see how young I looked in the photograph below [see insert page 3].10. Epstein took me on a ferry boat on one of the trips to New York City andthere he took the picture above. I was approximately 15 or 16 years old at thetime.11. Over the next few weeks, Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell trained me todo what they wanted, including sexual activities. The training was in New Yorkand Florida, at Epstein’s mansion. It was basically every day and it was likegoing to school. I also had to have sex with Epstein many times.12. I was trained to be “everything a man wanted me to be.” It wasn’t justsexual training—they wanted me to be able to cater to all the needs of the menthey were going to send me to. They said that they loved that I was verycompliant and knew how to keep my mouth shut about what they expected me to do.13. Epstein and Maxwell also told me that they wanted me to produce informationfor them in addition to performing sex on the men. They told me to pay attentionto the details about what the men wanted, so I could report back to them.14. While I had juvenile hopes of bettering my life, from very early on I wasalso afraid of Epstein. Epstein told me he was a billionaire. I told my motherthat I was working for this rich guy, and she said “go, go far away.” Epsteinhad promised me a lot, and I knew if I left I would be in big trouble. I waswitness to a lot of illegal and bad behavior by Epstein and his friends. If Ileft Epstein, he knew all kinds of powerful people. He could have had me killedor abducted, and I knew he was capable of that if I did not obey him. He let meknow that he knew many people in high places. Speaking about himself, he said “Ican get away” with things. Even as a teenager, I understood what this meant andit scared me, as I believe he intended.15. I visited and traveled with Jeffrey Epstein from 1999 through the summer of2002, and during that time I stayed with him for sexual activities at each ofhis houses (or mansions) in locations including New York City, New York; thearea of Santa Fe, New Mexico; Palm Beach, Florida; an island in the U.S. VirginIslands; and Paris, France. I had sex with him often in these places and alsowith the various people he demanded that I have sex with. Epstein paid me formany of these sexual encounters. Looking back, I realize that my only purposesfor Epstein, Maxwell, and their friends was to be used for sex.16. To illustrate my connection to these places, I include four photographstaken of me in New Mexico [see insert page 3 for one of the photographsmentioned]. The first one is a museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico. We had gonesightseeing for the day. Epstein took this picture of me. I was approximately 17at the time, judging from the looks of it. At the end of the day we returned toEpstein’s Zorro Ranch. The second picture is me on one of Epstein’s horses onthe ranch in New Mexico. The following two are from wintertime in New Mexico.17. When I was with him, Epstein had sex with underage girls on a daily basis.His interest in this kind of sex was obvious to the people around him. Theactivities were so obvious and bold that anyone spending any significant time atone of Epstein’s residences would have clearly been aware of what was going on.18. Epstein’s code word for sexual encounters was that it was a “massage.” Attimes the interaction between Epstein and the girls would start in the massageroom setting, but it was always a sexual encounter and never just a massage.19. In addition to constantly finding underage girls to satisfy their personaldesires, Epstein and Maxwell also got girls for Epstein’s friends andacquaintances. Epstein specifically told me that the reason for him doing thiswas so that they would “owe him,” they would “be in his pocket,” and he would“have something on them.” I understood that Epstein thought he could getleniency if he was ever caught doing anything illegal, or that he could escapetrouble altogether.Roberts submitted her declaration in support of a motion to be added as aplaintiff in a suit (ongoing, as of this writing) that sought to overturn anon-prosecution agreement that Jeffrey Epstein would reach with the government.Roberts was seeking to join a case brought against the government by two othervictims, but a judge denied her motion in April of 2015, explaining that thecase had already been pending for several years, and it was unnecessary to addan additional plaintiff.Roberts’s declaration, which goes on for another eight pages, and makestwenty-four additional points, was stricken from the record—the judge explainedthat the “lurid” and “unnecessary details” involving “non-parties” to thelawsuit against the government, were “immaterial and impertinent” to theproceedings.Through a representative, Ghislaine Maxwell called the allegations against her“obvious lies,” after which Roberts filed a defamation suit against Maxwell. Inan answer filed in the suit, Maxwell elaborated that Roberts’s “story of abuseat the hands of Ms. Maxwell” was “fabricated” for financial gain."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 35 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter035]Alicia: May 20, 1997Donald Trump’s instincts regarding Jeffrey Epstein were solid. But if thereporters who were beginning to look into Epstein’s mysterious background haddug a bit further, there’s a chance they would have hit pay dirt as well—and notjust in Palm Beach.In California, for instance, a paper trail already stretched from the SantaMonica Police Department to Epstein’s front door.In the spring—almost the summer—of 1997, a call came in to the police. The youngwoman who placed it—a young actress who’d appeared on Baywatch and GeneralHospital—said she’d been sexually assaulted at a trendy hotel called Shutters onthe Beach.The officer who took the call knew the woman’s name—Alicia*[part0121.xhtml#Footnote_9]—and her voice. A week earlier, she’d told him aboutan encounter with Epstein. The woman had not wanted to make a formal complaintat the time. But she had taken the cop’s card, and now he was happy to hear thatshe’d changed her mind.In a shaky voice, Alicia described Epstein as a tallish man—five feet eleven orsix feet in height was her guess—with gray hair and brown eyes. He was the ownerof a large black four-door Mercedes and was a regular at Shutters on the Beach,which was the kind of place that cost one thousand dollars a night and wasfrequented by actors, agents, and other Hollywood types.Alicia told the cop that she was a model and actress herself. She’d knownEpstein for about a month. They had a friend in common, and she’d sent him herhead shots.Then, through an assistant, Epstein had invited her to meet in his room at thehotel.Alicia said she was having reservations, the officer wrote in his report,because generally interviews are not conducted in hotel rooms.According to her, things turned frightening quickly.She was unsure she was safe because although she wanted to land the job as a‘Victoria’s Secret’ catalog model she felt as though Epstein was attempting toget her to act in an unprofessional manner for a model.Epstein wore navy blue sweatpants and a white T-shirt, she recalled. The T-shirthad the letters USA printed on it in patriotic red, white, and blue.Epstein told her to undress and actually assisted her to do so while saying ‘letme manhandle you for a second.’Then, Alicia told the cop, Epstein groped her buttocks against her will whileacting as though he was evaluating her body. Alicia had stopped Epstein, andleft the room, but couldn’t get over the incident.At the top of his crime report, the officer wrote “Sexual Battery.” But Epsteinwas never charged in the incident. “The Santa Monica Police Departmentdiscounted every one of [Alicia’s] allegations of improper conduct by JeffreyEpstein and they took no action on this 1997 complaint,” Epstein’s West PalmBeach attorney, Jack Goldberger, told the Palm Beach Post in 2010.“The cops said it’d be my word against his,” Alicia told the paper. “And sincehe had a lot of money, I let it go. I hadn’t thought much about it since, untilI saw his picture online. And now, I want everybody to know how much of a creephe’s always been.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 36 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter036]Graydon Carter: December 2002Graydon Carter, the legendary editor of Vanity Fair, likes to get to his officeearly, well before the rest of his staff files in.Most monthly magazines operate at a leisurely pace—three weeks of coming up withideas, assigning articles, and shooting the shit in the corporate kitchenfollowed by one frantic week when all the actual editing gets done. But thisisn’t the case at Vanity Fair, which runs hard-hitting investigative piecesalongside its glitzy celebrity profiles. There are also parties to plan andhost—incredibly glamorous parties, including the annual Oscar-night bash, whichis more fun and far more exclusive than the Academy Awards ceremony itself.Vanity Fair is an old, famous brand. But Carter is its public face, just as AnnaWintour is the face of Condé Nast’s iconic fashion magazine, Vogue.One cover of Vanity Fair can turn a minor celebrity into a superstar. And asingle thoroughly researched story can bring down a corporate overlord.Carter’s easy to recognize: the pompadour of white hair, like a lion’s mane. TheSanta Claus body stuffed into an impeccably tailored bespoke suit. He wears hisfame lightly. But he could not be more serious about his responsibilities, whichare weighing heavily on him this month. Months earlier, he’d assigned a piece toVicky Ward, an Englishwoman who wrote frequently for Vanity Fair. He’d meant forit to be an easy assignment: Ward was pregnant with twins. She wasn’t allowed tofly. But here was a story right on her doorstep. A nice, easy profile of JeffreyEpstein. Who was he, really? Carter knew he threw fabulous parties attended byacademics, billionaires, and beautiful women. Recently he’d flown Bill Clintonto Africa. But no one seemed to know how he had made his fortune. Epstein’sstory reminded the editor of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby.Carter himself could have stepped out of a novel—though in his case, the authorwould be Horatio Alger. A Canadian college dropout who’d worked as a railroadlineman, he arrived in New York in his late twenties and commenced anastonishingly quick rise up the social and media ladders. But where Carter wasopen and outgoing, Epstein really was Gatsby-like—very little about him wasknown. Maybe, Carter thought, Ward could find out. What did Epstein do, exactly,for money? Why was he so secretive? Why were so many brilliant and powerful mendrawn to him? And where did those beautiful women come from?Almost immediately, Epstein began a campaign to discredit Ward. He prevailedupon Conrad Black, the press baron and Epstein’s Palm Beach neighbor—who wasalso a step-uncle of Vicky Ward’s husband—to ask Ward to drop the story. ButWard was tenacious, and what she came back with was dynamite. More interestingand much more salacious than anything Carter had imagined.Now Carter’s staff was putting in the hours it would take to confirm all thethings she’d uncovered, picking the ones they could publish and laying them allout in a narrative that would be no less explosive than the facts it contained."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 37 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter037]Vicky Ward: October 2002Epstein went out of his way to spin the Vanity Fair story to his own ends, andsoon after she got the assignment, Vicky Ward’s phone began to ring off thehook: calls from Ace Greenberg and Jimmy Cayne, the current head of BearStearns; from Les Wexner; from academics, scientists, and movers and shakers whocounted Epstein among their friends.Then there were the calls from Epstein himself. He wouldn’t go on the record,but despite the rumors he’d spread behind Ward’s back, he was happy to talkinformally, even give her a tour of his Manhattan mansion and trot out storiesthat he had dined out on for years. By most accounts, Epstein could be extremelycharming—even if it had taken Ghislaine to teach him which forks to use when—andhe did his best to charm Vicky Ward. But she was not easily seduced, and sheturned out to have a keen eye for Epstein’s missteps.Over tea in his town house, she noticed, Epstein ate all the finger food thathad been put out for both of them. She found it odd that the only book thissupposedly brilliant man had left for her to see was a paperback by the Marquisde Sade. And then there was the call afterward from one of Epstein’sassistants—a woman Ward did not know—who told her, “Jeffrey wanted me to tellyou that you looked so pretty.”Ward is pretty, with fine English features and flowing blond hair. She was alsovery pregnant then, with a bad case of morning sickness. She threw up often,sometimes in public, and these clumsy advances on Epstein’s part only added toher ever-present nausea. For a man who was supposedly brilliant, he’d struckher, oddly, as not very smart.“Epstein is charming, but he doesn’t let the charm slip into his eyes,” shewrote. “They are steely and calculating, giving some hint at the steady whir ofmachinery running behind them. ‘Let’s play chess,’ he said to me, after refusingto give an interview for this article. ‘You be white. You get the first move.’It was an appropriate metaphor for a man who seems to feel he can win no matterwhat the advantage of the other side. His advantage is that no one really seemsto know him or his history completely or what his arsenal actually consists of.He has carefully engineered it so that he remains one of the few truly bafflingmysteries among New York’s moneyed world. People know snippets, but few know thewhole.”The testimonials Epstein’s friends gave were glowing: “I think we both possessthe skill of seeing patterns,” Les Wexner told her. “Jeffrey sees patterns inpolitics and financial markets, and I see patterns in lifestyle and fashiontrends. My skills are not in investment strategy, and, as everyone who knowsJeffrey knows, his are not in fashion and design. We frequently discuss worldtrends as each of us sees them.”“I’m on my 20th book,” said Alan Dershowitz, who’d met Epstein in 1997. “Theonly person outside of my immediate family that I send drafts to is Jeffrey.”But Ward also talked to other sources, who had their own questions and qualmsabout Jeffrey Epstein. Some were involved in lawsuits against him. Others hadserved on prestigious boards with him. One who had witnessed Epstein’s abortedstint on the board of Rockefeller University called him arrogant.One powerful investment manager wondered about Epstein’s conspicuous absencefrom New York’s trading floors. “The trading desks don’t seem to know him,” hesays. “It’s unusual for animals that big to not leave any footprints in thesnow.”Ward uncovered legal documents, including Epstein’s interview with the SEC,given in the wake of his departure from Bear Stearns. She visited a federalprison in Massachusetts and spoke at length with Steven Hoffenberg, who told herthat Epstein had made a major mistake in taking Bill Clinton to Africa. “Ialways told him to stay below the radar,” Hoffenberg said. He made otheraccusations, about Epstein’s financial practices, which Epstein denied—and Wardknew that Hoffenberg, the Ponzi-scheme mastermind, was not to be trusted. Butshe did find it strange that throughout the reporting process Epstein was muchless openly concerned with what she’d found out about his finances than withwhat she’d uncovered about his dealings with women.Time and again, he would call and ask her: “What do you have on the girls?”One young woman Ward talked to had been invited by Ghislaine Maxwell to attend aparty at Epstein’s town house. There, the woman had noticed, female guests faroutnumbered the male guests. “These were not women you’d see at Upper East Sidedinners,” the woman had said. “Many seemed foreign and dressed a littlebizarrely.”“This same guest also attended a cocktail party thrown by Maxwell that PrinceAndrew attended, which was filled, she says, with young Russian models,” Wardwrote. “‘Some of the guests were horrified,’ the woman says.”Another source, one who had worked with Epstein, said, “He’s reckless, and he’sgotten more so. Money does that to you. He’s breaking the oath he made tohimself—that he would never do anything that would expose him in the media.Right now, in the wake of the publicity following his trip with Clinton, he mustbe in a very difficult place.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 38 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter038]Vicky Ward: November 2002What I had ‘on the girls,’” Ward explained in a Daily Beast article publishedafter Epstein’s arrest, “were some remarkably brave first-person accounts. Threeon-the-record stories from a family: a mother and her daughters who came fromPhoenix. The oldest daughter, an artist whose character was vouchsafed to me byseveral sources, including the artist Eric Fischl, had told me, weeping as shesat in my living room, of how Epstein had attempted to seduce both her and,separately, her younger sister, then only 16.”Ward had written it all down in her notes. She had crossed the t’s, dotted thei’s.But when she called Epstein to get his response, he denied the allegationscompletely.“Just the mention of a 16-year-old girl,” Epstein told her, “carries the wrongimpression. I don’t see what it adds to the piece. And that makes me unhappy.”If some sort of criminal investigation had taken place, that would have been onething. But, at that time, no criminal investigation into Epstein’s affairs hadbeen launched. And in the absence of an investigation, the rumors of Epstein’sdealings with very young women seemed to be just that—rumors.Graydon Carter consulted his lawyers, his editors, and his fact-checkers. Andthen something odd and disturbing happened at the Condé Nast building, then inTimes Square.As usual, Carter had come into the office early. He swiped his key card in thelobby, pressed the elevator button, and arrived in the hallway outside thereception area on the twenty-first floor.It would have been a perfect time to review Ward’s story.Her description of Epstein’s town house—which is said to have been the largestprivate residence in New York City at the time—was priceless: “Inside, amid theflurry of menservants attired in sober black suits and pristine white gloves,you feel you have stumbled into someone’s private Xanadu,” she’d written. “Thisis no mere rich person’s home, but a high-walled, eclectic, imperious fantasythat seems to have no boundaries. The entrance hall is decorated not withpaintings but with row upon row of individually framed eyeballs; these, theowner tells people with relish, were imported from England, where they were madefor injured soldiers. Next comes a marble foyer, which does have a painting, inthe manner of Jean Dubuffet…but the host coyly refuses to tell visitors whopainted it. In any case, guests are like pygmies next to the nearbytwice-life-size sculpture of a naked African warrior.”The journalist had confirmed that several prominent names—Mort Zuckerman, thefamous real estate mogul and publisher; Microsoft executive Nathan Myhrvold; andDonald Trump among them—had dined at the residence. She’d interviewed several ofEpstein’s friends and ex-friends: Nobel Prize–winning scientists, financiers whoworked with Epstein at Bear Stearns. She’d handled Steven Hoffenberg withaplomb. And, working with Vanity Fair’s editors, she’d figured out ways to slipeven more information between the lines, in ways that would allow readers toform their own questions about Epstein’s finances.In that respect, she’d fulfilled her original assignment perfectly.What Carter needed to figure out was what to do with the artist, her sister, andtheir mother’s story. But before he could swipe his key card to let himself intothe magazine’s offices, Carter saw a man standing in the reception area.The man was motionless. He’d been waiting for Carter.It was Jeffrey Epstein. Nonplussed, Carter invited him into his office.Epstein denied the claims involving underage women. No criminal charges had beenfiled. And so Vanity Fair decided not to include the claims in Ward’s article.But, according to Ward, when her editor Doug Stumpf called her, she cried.She’d worked so hard on the piece, gotten so stressed out that one of her twinshad begun to grow more slowly than the other. On doctor’s orders, she’d been puton bed rest.“Why?” she asked when she got to speak to Carter directly.“He’s sensitive about the young women. And we still get to run most of thepiece.”In her notebook, Ward wrote down the rest of what Carter had said: “I believehim,” he told her. “I’m Canadian.”But the piece that came out, in the March issue, still created a sensation. Itwas called “The Talented Mr. Epstein” in a sly reference to Patricia Highsmith’scelebrated suspense novel The Talented Mr. Ripley. The film adaptation, byAnthony Minghella, was still fresh in the minds of Vanity Fair’s readers. ForGraydon Carter, just posing the question Is Epstein some sort of scam artist,like Ripley? had been question enough. And throughout the piece, there wereironies readers wouldn’t miss as they drew their own conclusions about Epstein’slife story. It came through clearly in the first line of the last paragraph ofWard’s 7,500-word story: “Many people comment there is something innocent,almost childlike about Jeffrey Epstein.”In context, the word innocent was rather ironic—so much so that it almost becameits own opposite."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 39 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter039]Todd Meister: June 2015Harry Cipriani, on Fifth Avenue, is a New York institution. The restaurant beganits life as an American outpost of Harry’s Bar—which was itself a famousAmerican outpost in Venice. Located inside the Sherry-Netherland hotel, it’s atheme restaurant—the theme being money. And today, a hedge-fund manager namedTodd Meister is talking about a very wealthy man—Jeffrey Epstein—whom he knowsthrough his father, Epstein’s sometime friend Bob Meister.“I’ve known Jeffrey since I was nineteen,” Meister says. “So let me tell youwhat I know—whatever everyone knows and everybody else says. First off, he’s nobillionaire. Second off—and here’s why—he has no clue how to invest. He haspeople do that for him.”Meister knows how to invest. He does it for other people and, as the son of asuperrich father, for himself. He also knows about the good life. Parties inVegas; weekends in the Hamptons; affairs with beautiful women that end upgetting splashed all over the tabloids.It makes sense that, once upon a time, he and Epstein would have gotten along.“As for the girls,” Meister says, “that was just business. He’d seat themstrategically at client dinners. When he went to the movies, he’d take three orfour girls with him. They’d take turns massaging his back, arms, and legs.”According to Meister, Epstein used to boast that he “liked to go into insaneasylums because he liked to fuck crazy women.”“Who knows if it’s true?” Meister adds. “But I’m telling you, he used to sayit.”From time to time, Epstein’s friends and acquaintances would see sides ofEpstein that he’d grown much less shy about sharing.Epstein encouraged Alan Dershowitz to invest with a prominent hedge-fund managernamed Orin Kramer. Dershowitz did, and he made a lot of money at first. But in2008, the fund Dershowitz had invested in lost a substantial amount. Afterward,according to a former associate of Epstein’s, Epstein appeared in Kramer’smidtown Manhattan office. There, sources say, he told Kramer: “It’s very much inyour interest to make Alan Dershowitz whole.”Epstein’s intervention worked, and Dershowitz recovered his money.To people who’d known Epstein back in the 1980s, this kind of behavior was outof character. But the thing about Epstein was that you never could figure himout. One minute he was charming. The most charming man you’d ever meet. The nexthe was snarl, threat, and bluster. Something didn’t add up. So you’d run thenumbers: this many parties, that many women. Even with the connection toVictoria’s Secret, the women didn’t add up, either.Throw in the modeling agency, it makes more sense. Then you plug in the parties.The scene brings Eyes Wide Shut to mind. But the thing is, Eyes Wide Shut onlyworks in the shadows. For Epstein, getting on that plane with Clinton was morelike a moment in Caddyshack—the one in which the groundhog peeks out from hishole in the golf course. From there on in, Jeffrey Epstein was like the mole ina game of whack-a-mole. It was only a matter of time before he’d be caught. Butthe question you had to ask yourself was, are people like Epstein born withoutmorals? Or are their morals like snakeskin—just something they shed (along withall the other basic, day-to-day concerns that everyday working people have) asthey make their way into that Eyes Wide Shut world?Todd Meister, who was married to Nicky Hilton and stole the heiress SamanthaBoardman away from Condé Nast’s former editorial director James Truman, shouldknow. He wonders out loud:“How does a yutz like Epstein get beautiful women?”At Harry Cipriani, the question lingers in the air."},{"pageContent":"PART IV [part0123.xhtml#toc-part004]THE INVESTIGATION [part0123.xhtml#toc-part004]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 40 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter040]Michael Reiter: January 2006As far as Michael Reiter’s concerned, the case that his team has built againstEpstein—slowly, meticulously, over the course of an entire year—is airtight.Even now, Detective Recarey’s finding new pieces of evidence. And alreadyReiter’s been laying the groundwork with prosecutors. State attorney BarryKrischer has a reputation for toughness. He’s known, nationally, for hisprosecution of juvenile offenders. And Reiter’s been keeping him abreast of theinvestigation. With Jeffrey Epstein, it’s not simply a matter of seeing himpunished. It’s a matter of getting a sexual predator off the streets of PalmBeach.Krischer assures the chief that he’s taking this case very seriously.The state attorney’s office will have Reiter’s back at every turn.“I told him that we had an investigation that was very serious that involved avery noteworthy person and that involved a number of underage females,” Reiterwould say in his deposition for the suit that was later settled by Epstein.“That it was of a sexual nature. I was concerned that we had not reached all ofthe victims, and we hadn’t, I’m sure, at this point. I told him that I felt likethe suspect would probably become aware of the investigation at some point andthat we should probably expect some contact from…Mr. Epstein’s lawyers. And Itold him that I wanted to keep him very well informed on this and that I hopedthat he would do the same. And that we would have to have more contact in makingsure it was handled responsibly, intelligently, and appropriately as it movedforward.”Reiter would say that Epstein’s name did not seem to ring a bell with the stateattorney. But shortly afterward, the chief became aware that in certain powerfulcircles his investigation was being looked upon unfavorably. “I had manypeople-related conversations…on the cocktail-party circuit that suggested weapproach this in a way that wasn’t necessary,” he would say.Michael Reiter was a good cop. A good man. But he was about to discover thatwhen it came to men with the power and influence Epstein wielded, fairness underthe law was a relative, malleable concept."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 41 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter041]Detective Recarey: February 2006For months, Joe Recarey’s been interviewing girls who’d been brought toEpstein’s house, subpoenaing telephone and car-rental records, conductingsurveillance. Ultimately, according to a source within the Palm Beach PD, thedepartment would identify forty-seven underage girls who’d been molested on ElBrillo Way.Recarey interviewed one of Epstein’s pilots, a man named David Rogers, as wellas Epstein’s houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez. He also spoke to a woman who reallywas a massage therapist.It turned out that Epstein paid just one hundred dollars for actual Swedishdeep-tissue massages that the therapist provided for him and his friends, thelawyer Alan Dershowitz among them.Did anything untoward ever happen? Recarey asked. Had Epstein ever asked thewoman to rub his chest?No, she told him. She wasn’t Epstein’s type. The girls she’d seen at his housewere very thin and beautiful and did not have tattoos. This massage therapisthad several tattoos that were visible, and on quite a few occasions Epstein andGhislaine Maxwell had made negative comments about them.According to a Palm Beach Police Department Incident Report filed by Recarey onJuly 25, 2006, the detective had also heard from Mary’s father, who said that aprivate eye had been to his house, photographing his family and chasing visitorsaway.Mary’s dad had gotten the license plate—Florida E79-4EG.Recarey traced it back to one Ivan Robles of West Palm Beach. Robles turned outto be a licensed private investigator.Recarey informed the state’s attorney’s office.Alison also contacted Recarey and told him that she’d been approached by someonewho was in touch with Epstein. Alison had been told that she’d receive money ifshe would refuse to cooperate with the police.Those who help him will be compensated, she was told, according to DetectiveRecarey’s incident report. “And those who hurt him will be dealt with.”Recarey reassured the girl and told her that tampering with a witness in a caselike this was a serious, arrestable offense.Then he told an assistant state attorney.The detective was leaving no i undotted and no t uncrossed.But he did wonder if the state attorney’s office itself had become part of theproblem."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 42 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter042]Barry Krischer: April 2006State attorney Barry Krischer was an elected official, but before taking hispost, he’d been a lawyer in private practice in and around Palm Beach. Electedtwice to his office, in 1992 and 1996, he had run unopposed for state attorneyin 2000 and 2004. During the course of his long career, which began in 1970 witha three-year stint in the district attorney’s office in Brooklyn, he received anumber of awards: the pro bono award from the Legal Aid Society of Palm BeachCounty for his service with the juvenile justice system and for his work withthe child protection team; the Peace at Home award, presented by Governor JebBush, for his work with victims of family violence; a lifetime achievement awardfrom the Florida Bar. He was a board member of the National District AttorneysAssociation. And he was not necessarily averse to going after the rich andpowerful. In 2003, he launched an investigation into Rush Limbaugh’s use of, andmeans of obtaining, oxycodone and hydrocodone. (A few years after Limbaugh’sarrest, which coincided with Chief Reiter’s investigation into Jeffrey Epstein,the talk-show host settled with prosecutors, agreed to submit to random drugtesting, and gave up his firearms permit.)Krischer himself, however, had been accused of sexual misconduct.In October of 1992, Jodi Bergeron, a legal secretary who’d worked for Krischer,filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against him in the Palm Beach County circuitcourt. That suit was dismissed, but a few months later, the woman took Krischerto federal court, accusing him of making unwanted advances and demandingrecompense for battery, negligence, invasion of privacy, and emotional distress.Krischer had placed his hands, violently, inside her blouse, the woman said.He’d forcibly fondled her breasts, forcibly kissed her, and rubbed her shoulderswhile brushing her buttocks with his hands and knees, all while accompanying thegestures with verbal advances.When she declined those advances, the woman claimed, Krischer fired her.Krischer denied the allegations. At the time, he was making his first run forthe state attorney’s office. The charges were politically motivated, he said.Members of a local chapter of NOW—the National Organization for Women—had stoodby the lawyer, citing his efforts to stop domestic violence, among his othervirtues.“I am here to support Barry Krischer for the work his office did in mydaughter’s case,” one woman said during a rally that took place in front of thecourthouse. “Her murderer received the maximum sentence, a life sentence.”The second lawsuit had also been dismissed—after Krischer’s former law firmagreed to pay Bergeron’s attorney seven thousand dollars in legal fees.Now Chief Reiter and Detective Recarey were beginning to have their ownquestions about Barry Krischer. The Palm Beach PD wanted to charge Epstein withone count of lewd and lascivious behavior and four counts of unlawful sexualactivity with a minor—felony charges that would have amounted to years behindbars in the case of a conviction. Wendy Dobbs and Sarah Kellen would be chargedas accomplices.This was not the plan that Krischer seemed to have in mind for Jeffrey Epstein.In cases involving the sexual abuse of minors, prosecuting attorneys tend tohave suspects arrested, then push for a trial. But instead of granting hisapproval for an arrest, Krischer told the police that he would convene a grandjury, which would be asked to consider a broad range of charges.In a case such as Epstein’s, this was highly unusual. Not damning in and ofitself. But very strange. In Florida, grand juries are only required in capitalcases. At the state attorney’s discretion, they may also be called incontroversial cases—for instance, cases involving crimes committed by publicofficials. But Jeffrey Epstein wasn’t a public official, and as far as the PalmBeach PD was concerned, the only controversial thing about the case they’d builtwas that Epstein was rich and well connected. In his deposition for B.B. vs.Epstein, Chief Reiter rel ayed Krischer’s concerns: the prosecutor had to makesure that his case was solid, beyond a reasonable doubt. And Krischer did havehis doubts about the credibility of the young women who’d be called to testifyagainst Epstein.Even so, Reiter was beginning to wonder if Krischer was stacking the deck inEpstein’s favor—if, thanks to the sway prosecutors have over grand juries,assembling such a jury wasn’t an excellent way to let Epstein off with thelightest punishment possible.Another unusual thing: the way Barry Krischer and the lawyers working for himignored Chief Reiter’s multiple phone calls as well as Detective Recarey’s—eventhough the police had been hearing from Epstein’s own lawyers.“[Krischer] and I had an excellent relationship,” Chief Reiter said in hisdeposition. “I was the speaker at his swearing-in ceremony. And that he wouldn’treturn my phone calls—I mean, it was clear to me by his actions that he couldnot objectively look at this case.”In the incident report he ended up writing, Detective Recarey remembered a phonecall that he received from Guy Fronstin, one of the lawyers representingEpstein.It was a message Epstein wanted to send, something central to the case thatdemanded explanation. The whole shit show swirling around him was just amisunderstanding—a misrepresentation—of Epstein’s actual interests andintentions.Fronstin says Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages, Detective Recareywould write.And: Mr. Epstein had donated over $100,000 to the Ballet of Florida formassages.And: The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound for him. That is why hehas had so many massages."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 43 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter043]Palm Beach Police Department Incident Report Filed by Detective Joseph Recarey:July 25, 2006On April 13 and April 14, 2006, I attempted contact on several occasions withASA [assistant state attorney Daliah] Weiss and ASA [Lanna] Belohlavek toascertain when the victims needed to report for Grand Jury testimony. Messageswere left on their voicemail. On April 17, 2006, during the hours of 9:00 am and11:30 am I again left messages for ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavek for either ofthem to return my call as I had not heard from the State Attorney’s Office as tothe time and date of the Grand Jury.At approximately 12:30 pm, I went to the State Attorney’s Office and Located ASAWeiss and ASA Belohlavek in their offices. I entered ASA Belohlavek’s office whoinformed me that she was going to return my call. She explained that an offerwas made to the Defense, Atty Guy Fronstin and Atty Alan Dershowitz. The offeris 1 count of Agg Assault with intent to commit a felony, five years probation,with adjudication withheld. Epstein would have to submit to psychiatric/sexualevaluation and no unsupervised visits with minors. When asked about all theother victims, ASA Belohlavek stated that was the only offer made as to onevictim, [Mary]. ASA Belohlavek[’s] cell phone rang and went to voice mail. Shechecked her voice mail and played the message on speaker. The caller identifiedhimself as Atty Guy Fronstin and acknowledged the deal made between them.Fronstin stated in the message, he spoke with his client, Jeffrey Epstein, andwould agree to this deal. Fronstin asked to call off the grand jury as theywould accept this deal. Belohlavek stated a probable cause would be needed tobook Epstein in the county Jail and would let me know as to when it was needed.I explained my disapproval of the deal and not being consulted prior to the dealbeing offered. However I expressed that was only my opinion and the finalapproval would come from the Chief of Police. She explained to have Chief Reitercall Barry Krischer about the deal. I left the area and returned to the policestation where I briefed the Chief about the deal offered.I checked my voice mail messages and discovered a message from [the] stepmotherfor the victim [Mary]. She was calling because the State Attorney’s Office stillhad not returned any of her calls as to when they are needed for this case. Ithen called ASA Belohlavek’s office and left messages for her to call thevictims on this case and explain to them what the State Attorney’s Office haddone."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 44 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter044]Michael Reiter: May 2006A plea offer?Chief Reiter is outraged. His team has logged thou-sands of hours of work.They’ve assembled mountains of evidence. But instead of going to trial, thestate attorney wants to see Epstein get off with a misdemeanor, five years ofprobation, and a psych exam.Why?Alan Dershowitz has presented the prosecutors with his own pieces ofevidence—printouts from the victims’ Myspace pages.In her “About Me” column, under “Best physical feature,” Mary has written “Assand eyes.”Under “Ever drank” and “Ever smoked pot,” she’s written “Yeah.”Under “Ever shoplifted”: “Lots.”Under “Ever skinny dipped”: “Yeah.”Under “[Do] you wanna lose your virginity”: “I already lost it.”One of the victims has been caught with drugs and arrested. She’s also beencaught stealing from Victoria’s Secret. From the state attorney’s perspective,these girls look like compromised women. And if what they say about Epstein istrue, wouldn’t that make them prostitutes?As witnesses, they would be weak, while the lawyers on Epstein’s side wereexceptionally strong.Alan Dershowitz had represented Claus von Bülow, the British socialite who wasacquitted of the murder of his wife, Sunny. Dershowitz had been on O. J.Simpson’s team when the former football star was acquitted of the murders of hisex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson and Nicole’s friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. And richas von Bülow and Simpson had been, neither one had had the resources thatEpstein was willing and able to deploy in his own defense.Neither of them had been intimate friends with his lawyer.As far as Reiter was concerned, none of that mattered. Even if Epstein thoughtthat the girls he’d molested were eighteen years old—even if they had lied tohim—it didn’t matter under Florida law. The chief grew worried that in Epstein’scase exceptions were being made, and he grew even more concerned with eachunreturned call that he made to the state attorney’s office.On May 1, the Palm Beach PD asked the state attorney’s office to issue an arrestwarrant for Jeffrey Epstein.That same day, Chief Reiter took the extraordinary step of writing BarryKrischer a letter all but demanding that he recuse himself from the case."},{"pageContent":"Book Title Page [../Images/image00181.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 45 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter045]Videotaped Deposition of Michael Reiter in B.B. vs. Epstein, a civil lawsuitagainst Jeffrey Epstein: November 23, 2009Q:At some point you sent a letter to state attorney Barry Krischer. Let me showyou what we’ll mark as exhibit 3. Let me give you a chance to read through thisletter again to help refresh your recollection.A:I’ve read it.Q:At this point, in May of 2006, I’m assuming based on what you told us beforethat you had had some conversations with Barry Krischer directly…byphone—correct?—prior to this letter.A:I had conversations in person and by phone.Q:Okay. But nonetheless in May—May 1, 2006—you felt the need to write thisletter; is that correct?A:Yes.Q:Can you tell us why?A:Well, I felt the handling—and just continued to feel that the way the stateattorney’s office handled this case was extremely unusual. I knew that Mr.Krischer was making decisions about this case. I felt that his objectivity waslacking, and I felt that the appropriate way, after reading the statute thatgoverned the assignment of cases to other circuits—I felt that his action metthe standard. I used some of the words from the statute in here. And I attemptedto call him, and he wouldn’t return my phone calls.The detective attempted to contact—his contact in the state attorney’s office,Lanna Belohlavek, however you pronounce that…and she wouldn’t return his calls.So I wrote the letter in hope that he would think about his situation andrealize that his objectivity was insufficient to prosecute the case and ask thegovernor to appoint someone else. And I felt like that was necessary for a fairprosecution of our case that had been submitted to him.Q:Could you tell us, explain to us, why you felt that his objectivity may belacking in regards to this prosecution…? In other words, what evidence did yousee here, uncover, that you felt made it potentially nonobjective?A:Well…when I first told him about the case, and I realized that it was aserious case, [that] there were multiple victims, [and] that the suspect wasvery well known, I told him about it. And we were—it was in person. I talked tohim after a meeting that he and I were both involved in. And I had known him tobe a victim advocate and to protect the rights of children. Well, I know that heeven wrote a portion of the statute that addresses those issues. And when I toldhim originally, he said, “Let’s go for it; this is an adult male in his fiftieswho’s had sexual contact with children of the ages of the victims.” He said thisis somebody who we have to stop. And whatever we need, he said, in the stateattorney’s office, we have a unit that’s equipped to investigate and prosecutethese kinds of cases. And I didn’t have too many facts early on when I talkedwith him, but I knew that there were multiple victims and to our detectives theywere believable. So when time went on and Mr. Epstein became aware of theinvestigation and his lawyers contacted the state attorney’s office, they toldme that.And from that point on, and I believe it was Mr. Dershowitz initially, the toneand tenor of the discussions of this case with Mr. Krischer changed completely.[At] one point he suggested that we write [Epstein] a notice to appear, whichwould be for a misdemeanor. He just completely changed from not only our firstconversation about this[—when] he didn’t know the name Jeffrey Epstein—till whenhe had been informed on Mr. Epstein’s reputation and his wealth, and I justthought that very unusual.I feel like I know him or knew him very well, the state attorney, and I justfelt like he could not objectively make decisions about this case: that is why Iwrote it."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 46 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter046]Detective Recarey: May 2006Chief Reiter’s letter to the state attorney had no perceptible effect.Krischer did not recuse himself from the case. No arrest warrant was issued. Andon the afternoon of May 3, Detective Recarey received a telephone call fromassistant state attorney Daliah Weiss, who advised him that she had been takenoff the Epstein case.Weiss had been the perfect person to prosecute Epstein. As a member of thespecial victims unit, she focused on sex crimes and crimes against children,prosecuting high-profile cases involving rape, aggravated child abuse, andneglect. But Epstein had added another lawyer, a man named Jack Goldberger, andmade Goldberger his attorney of record.Goldberger was friendly with Barry Krischer—and an associate of Goldberger’s wasmarried to Daliah Weiss.If Epstein’s legal team had wanted to remove Weiss from the case, this wouldhave been a good way to do it.Nine days later, Detective Recarey met with ASA Lanna Belohlavek, who told himthat her boss, Barry Krischer, had asked her again to take the case to the grandjury. Recarey told Belohlavek that he had already requested arrest warrants forEpstein, Sarah Kellen, and Wendy Dobbs. The Palm Beach PD had finished itsinvestigation months earlier, he said, and had been waiting since then for thecase to move forward. He asked her once more to issue the warrants. Once againBelohlavek declined, saying that the original offer her office had made toEpstein’s old lawyer had been resubmitted to the new lawyer. When Epstein’sreply came, she would call.While waiting for that call, Recarey received several calls from Mary’s father,who told him that he was being followed by a green Chevrolet Monte Carlo—tailedso aggressively that other vehicles were being run off the road. Recarey ran theplates and found that the Chevy was registered to one Zachary Bechard ofJupiter, Florida.Bechard was a licensed private eye.“A funny thing happened in Palm Beach,” says Tim Malloy, who was working as a TVnewscaster in South Florida at the time.“This would have been right around the time that Michael Reiter sent his letterasking Barry Krischer to recuse himself from the case. I didn’t even know whatEpstein looked like, really, at the time. We had pictures taken by the Britishtabloids, where the link to Prince Andrew first broke. But we didn’t have toomany of them. What we did have was a contact in the hangar where Epstein kepthis 727.“I don’t know how much you know about Palm Beach International Airport. It’s thekind of place that has private hangars, valet parking, and waiting lounges thatlook as chic as anything you’ll see in Manhattan. It’s an airport for the rich,basically. Saudi princes, heads of state. Powerful men who value their privacy.You can bring limousines onto the tarmac. And we found out Epstein was verysecretive about his dealings there. He didn’t want anyone to know the tailnumbers on his planes.“But our contact didn’t like Epstein. And he was horrified by how young thegirls around Epstein were. So thanks to him, we had the 727’s tail number, andthanks to one other source—someone I won’t say too much about here—we hadEpstein’s flight plan for a certain trip he was making. We knew he was going toland at the airport. And so our producer climbed into the station’s traffichelicopter and told the pilot to hover at five hundred feet a quarter mile southof the field.“Our cameraman had a telephoto lens. The idea was to get a tight shot, on video,of Epstein deplaning. And for a moment we did get the shot: Epstein, with thecollar of his cashmere coat flipped up over his neck, about to run down thesteps into a cart that was waiting for him.“Then he saw our helicopter, with the station’s markings.“I was doing a live voice-over on Epstein’s arrival. It was the first videoanyone had on him up to that point. But Epstein had run back onto the plane.Then, during the next commercial break, my producer told me through myheadpiece: ‘Jeffrey Epstein wants us to stop taking his picture. In fact, hewants to talk to you.’“The cameraman kept rolling. And eventually Epstein got out, got into a car withtinted windows, and was driven over the bridge to his home in Palm Beach. So ina sense we failed to get the story. But the fact that Epstein would call a newsprogram from his plane and command them to order the program’s traffichelicopter away—that says something about the man’s arrogance. And maybe histemper.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 47 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter047]Mary: July 2006On June 29, assistant state attorney Lanna Belohlavek told Detective Recareythat despite his protestations, the case would be going to a grand jury afterall. One had been convened for July 19.On July 12, Recarey spoke with Mary’s stepmother, who said that she still hadn’theard from the state attorney’s office. This, too, was odd, since Recarey knewthat Mary would be called upon to testify.She was back in Palm Beach now, after months of living with out-of-staterelatives.All in all, it had been a very tough year for Mary.“What has happened to my daughter’s life is criminal,” her father would say.Mary had been sent to a school for troubled children. For her it was the wrongplace at the worst time in her life. She had gotten into more fights there,growing depressed and withdrawn from her sister and parents. Helplessly, herparents watched her spiral out of control. As they neared the end of their rope,they sent her out of state. But after the move, Mary had fallen apartcompletely. She used drugs, fell in with a bad crowd, ran away from herrelatives, and shacked up with a gang of drug dealers.When the gang was busted by local police, the dealers blamed Mary for snitchingand put out the word that they wanted her dead.“We had to move her again,” Mary’s father explained. “We finally got her intotherapy—she’s still seeing the therapist. And worst of all, she developed HPV.She’s already had to have a serious operation.”Mary’s troubles didn’t end there. On June 28, she was brought in front of thegrand jury. She hadn’t been briefed by the state attorney—she hadn’t even metthe prosecutors—and she had no idea what she would be asked.Almost immediately, she found that she was being treated more like a criminalthan like a witness or victim.“The prosecutor produced a printout of our daughter’s Myspace page,” Mary’sfather recalls. “Mary was stunned. She began to cry. The prosecutor accused herof all sort of things; it was like she was working for Epstein.“All this time, we knew that we were being watched. Creepy guys. Privateinvestigators from Miami. They would follow us, scaring the hell out of my wifeand Mary’s sister. My car was vandalized. It was like living in hell.”By this point, Epstein’s defense dream team included Jack Goldberger, AlanDershowitz, and Gerald Lefcourt. All of them had excellent track records.Dershowitz and Lefcourt were two of America’s most famous lawyers, and beforelong, another celebrity lawyer—Ken Starr, the former solicitor general who hadhad Bill Clinton impeached for perjury—would join Epstein’s team.As far as Mary’s parents were concerned, their daughter had walked into anambush. Everyone in the courtroom seemed to be playing defense on the side ofJeffrey Epstein. And as for the second girl—Alison, who claimed that she hadbeen raped—she never testified in court at all."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 48 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter048]Michael Reiter: July 2006On July 28, the grand jury reached a verdict that floored the Palm Beach PD.The original plea deal that Krischer had offered to Epstein had been bad enough.Now the grand jury was recommending that Epstein be charged with just one felonycount of solicitation of prostitution.There was no mention of underage girls. The original accusation—four felonycounts of unlawful sex acts with minors and one felony count of lewd andlascivious molestation—had simply evaporated.It wasn’t enough to send Epstein to prison.Epstein was allowed to surrender on a Sunday, when no one would know he’d beenarraigned. A few hours later, he was released on three thousand dollars bail.The Palm Beach PD was not even notified.Once again, Chief Reiter was outraged. So much so that he took the extraordinarystep of calling the FBI and the federal prosecutor’s office.At the time, the federal prosecutor of the Southern District of Florida was aRepublican named R. Alexander Acosta. Chief Reiter recalls being present atAcosta’s swearing-in ceremony and remembers Acosta’s declaration that one of hisgoals would be the prosecution, to the fullest extent of the law, of anyone whotakes advantage of the weak—especially perpetrators of sex crimes. Disgustedwith Krischer’s laissez-faire attitude, Reiter recalls thinking he’d found hisman.In Acosta, the chief saw a prosecutor who wouldn’t shy away from confronting aman with Jeffrey Epstein’s resources and connections.But it turned out that Acosta had worked under Ken Starr at Starr’s high-poweredmultinational law firm, Kirkland & Ellis. And while Acosta had a sterlingrésumé, which included a stint clerking for future Supreme Court justice SamuelAlito, he had only argued two cases before a judge.At the time, Reiter did not know this. All he knew was that someone had to lookmuch more seriously into Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes.Reiter’s actions did not necessarily make him a hero—at least, not in everycorner of the community he served.“I had individuals suggest that the department’s approach to the investigationand my referral of the investigation to the FBI was more horsepower than theinvestigation deserved. And I had other individuals suggest that—yeah, the term‘back off’ probably fits,” Reiter said in his deposition for B.B. vs. Epstein.“I had people in the community in Palm Beach who either made comments directlyto me or to others who relayed them to me that I didn’t need to take the tack inthe investigation that we did, which is [to] completely investigate it and thenrefer it to the FBI after the state case was resolved,” Reiter said in thedeposition. “I had one individual who came to see me a couple of times aboutthis.”According to the chief, the individual in question was a prominent Palm Beachpolitician.“He said this wasn’t necessary; this was a case that was really very minor,”Reiter recalled. “The victims had lifestyles that don’t make them—shouldn’t makethem believable to the police department.”“I told him that those kinds of suggestions to me were improper and he shouldstop,” said Reiter. “That he had taken a couple of steps down the road towardsomething that could eventually constitute a crime. We talked several times.Early on it didn’t end favorably. You know, this is an individual [whom] I hadto interact with in my official capacity and in his official capacity as well.”The Palm Beach politician wasn’t the only one to pressure the police chief. “Ireceived comments from a variety of different viewpoints…in some cases I hadpeople tell me, hey, he’s a Palm Beacher, why are you investigating a PalmBeacher?” Reiter would say when deposed. “I had people that said it was anunfavorable career move for me to ask the state attorney to remove himself fromthe case and to refer it to the FBI….I had plenty of people that told me thatthat was a mistake.”Reiter didn’t back off. To have done so would have been a betrayal—not only ofthe victims but also of his vocation and the community he had sworn he wouldserve.“My responsibility was to protect everyone that lives in Palm Beach and preservetheir constitutional rights and be the police department for all,” Reiter said.“And I think that under the law, particularly under the criminal laws, that allpeople have to, by the nature of our system, be treated exactly alike.”But along with handing the case off to the FBI and the US attorney, Reiter tookanother unusual step. He wrote personal letters—on Palm Beach PD letterhead—tothe parents of the victims in the case.He delivered the letters by hand."},{"pageContent":"Book Title Page [../Images/image00182.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 49 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter049]Jeffrey Epstein: September 2007In the winter of 2013, Scott Blake, a forty-seven-year-old middle schoolprincipal from Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, would be sentenced to the minimummandatory sentence—ten years in prison, with ten years of probation on top—forpleading guilty to one charge of soliciting sex with a minor.Blake’s crime? He sent sexually charged messages to a Boynton Beach policeofficer who was pretending to be a fifteen-year-old boy. But in a sense, Blakewas lucky: he could have been sentenced to life. The case was an interestingexample of the kind of treatment regular Florida folks could expect just forsoliciting sex with a minor. But nothing about Jeffrey Epstein was regular—andthe plea deal he managed to strike in 2007 was simply extraordinary.Epstein had bought himself one of the best defense teams ever assembled. Hisconnections and contributions to Democratic causes had made him a player on thatside of the political aisle. He had a famous Republican, Bill Clinton’s nemesis,Ken Starr, working the other side. And just to make sure they’d covered thebases, Epstein’s team also recruited Roy Black—the lawyer who’d cleared WilliamKennedy Smith of rape and kept Rush Limbaugh out of prison for his allegedillegal drug use—and Jay Lefkowitz, a defense attorney who’d worked with USattorney R. Alexander Acosta at Ken Starr’s law firm.And so in September, the US attorney’s office reached a formal agreement withEpstein’s team: the United States would defer federal prosecution in favor ofprosecution by the state of Florida.A non-prosecution agreement (NPA) was drafted; among other things, it assuredEpstein that he would not be prosecuted in the Southern District of Florida forfelony offenses involving the sexual abuse of underage girls. (By that point,thirty known victims had been discovered.) Instead it allowed him to pleadguilty to state felony offenses for solicitation of prostitution and theprocurement of minors for prostitution. The NPA established a procedure thatallowed Epstein’s victims to sue him in civil court and took the extraordinarystep of ensuring that “any potential co-conspirators” of Epstein’s would beimmune from prosecution.“In consideration of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to providecompensation in the manner described above, if Epstein successfully fulfills allof the terms and conditions of this agreement, the United States also agreesthat it will not institute any criminal charges against any potentialco-conspirators of Epstein,” the agreement stated, mentioning Sarah Kellen andNadia Marcinkova by name.“The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of any publicrecord,” the document concludes. “If the United States receives a Freedom ofInformation Act request or any compulsory process commanding the disclosure ofthe agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that disclosure.”Remarkably, despite assurances they’d received from the feds, none of thevictims was consulted prior to the drafting of this NPA.If Epstein did not sign the agreement, he faced a fifty-seven-count indictmentand a decade or more in prison. But Epstein’s team of lawyers had gotten him adeal so sweet it could have rotted all the teeth in South Florida.For all his protestations of innocence, there was every reason in the world toagree to an NPA.On September 24, 2007, Epstein did sign it.Once again, none of the victims had been consulted or notified."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 50 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter050]Jane Doe: February 2008As a result of the non-prosecution agreement, a fifty-three-count indictmentthat federal prosecutors had prepared against Jeffrey Epstein—one that claimedhe’d abused dozens of underage women—never was filed.But as far as lawyers representing Epstein’s victims were concerned, the factthat those victims were not consulted about the non-prosecution agreement wasinexcusable. The “government deliberately kept crime victims ‘in the dark’ sothat it could enter into a plea arrangement designed to prevent the victims fromraising any objections,” they would argue, in documents filed on February 10,2016. For nine months, the lawyers claimed, from the time that the NPA wassigned, on September 24, 2007, Krischer’s office, “doing Epstein’s bidding,[had] concealed the NPA’s existence from victim[s]” and continued to do so untilthe moment that Epstein had to plead guilty in court, which he finally did June30, 2008.In the interim, according to their lawyers, Epstein’s victims were only told,“This case is currently under investigation.”A lawsuit that Bradley Edwards, a victims’ rights attorney in Fort Lauderdale,filed in July of 2008 cited the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, or CVRA (title 18,section 3771, of the US Code), which states that “victims of federal crimes haverights, including the right to be heard in court, and most particularly, not tobe precluded from court proceedings, and the right to be treated fairly.”According to him, prosecutors had violated the CVRA rights of the victims.Edwards, who said he was working pro bono, knew that this suit against thegovernment would not allow for monetary recovery of any sort (including lawyers’fees). But he also knew that if the government, urged by Jeffrey Epstein, hadentered into a contract that improperly or illegally violated the rights ofEpstein’s victims, then that contract, by nature, would have been improper inand of itself—in which case, the only remedy would have been to have thecontract invalidated. And while it is difficult to know what, exactly, wouldhappen if the contract is overturned, one possibility is that the governmentcould prosecute Epstein for crimes against his victims, if the statute oflimitations on those crimes has not expired.At the time of this writing, that case is winding its way through the courts. Ithas all the earmarks of a modern-day Bleak House—the Charles Dickens novel abouta legal case that is so massive and so complex that it drags on forever anddrags everyone involved into the mire.In the meantime, Epstein began to settle out of court with his victims.In February of 2008, a Virginia woman who went by the alias Jane Doe #2 broughta fifty-million-dollar lawsuit against Epstein.At the time of their meeting, she claimed, Epstein was fifty-two years old. Shewas a teenager, and her complaint, which was made public, gave the rest of theworld an early glimpse of what Epstein, and the inner workings of his secretworld, looked like from a victim’s perspective.“Epstein is a financier and money manager with a secret clientele limitedexclusively to billionaires,” the lawsuit alleged. “He is himself a man oftremendous wealth, power and influence. He maintains his principal home in NewYork and also owns residences in New Mexico, St. Thomas and Palm Beach, FL. Theallegations herein concern Epstein’s conduct while at his lavish estate in PalmBeach.” The complaint continued:Upon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference and obsession forunderage minor girls. He engaged in a plan and scheme in which he gained accessto primarily economically disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexuallyassaulted these girls, and then gave them money. In or about 2004–2005, JaneDoe, then approximately 16 years old, fell into Epstein’s trap and became one ofhis victims.Upon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out his schemes andassaulted girls in Florida, New York, and on his private Island, known as LittleSt. James, in St. Thomas.Epstein’s scheme involved the use of young girls to recruit underage girls.(Upon information and belief, the young girl who brought Jane Doe to Epstein washerself a minor victim of Epstein, and will therefore not be named in thisComplaint.) Under Epstein’s plan, underage girls were recruited ostensibly togive a wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beachmansion. The recruiter would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at hisPalm Beach residence or soon after he had arrived there. Epstein or someone onhis behalf would direct the recruiter to bring one or more underage girls to theresidence. The recruiter, upon information and belief, generally sought outeconomically disadvantaged underaged girls from western Palm Beach County whowould be enticed by the money being offered—generally $200 to $300 per “massage”session—and who were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or havecredibility if allegations of improper conduct were made. This was an importantelement of Epstein’s plan.Epstein’s plan reflected a particular pattern and method. Upon arrival atEpstein’s mansion, the underaged victim would be introduced to Sarah Kellen,Epstein’s assistant, who gathered the girl’s personal information, including hername and telephone number. Ms. Kellen would then bring the girl up a flight ofstairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table in addition to otherfurnishings. There were photographs of nude women lining the stairway hall andin the bedroom. The girl would then find herself alone in the room with Epstein,who would be wearing only a towel. He would then remove his towel and lie nakedon the massage table, and direct the girl to remove her clothes. Epstein wouldthen perform one or more lewd, lascivious and sexual acts, includingmasturbation and touching the girl’s vagina.Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Jane Doe was recruited to giveEpstein a massage for monetary compensation. Jane was brought to Epstein’smansion in Palm Beach. Once at the mansion, Jane was introduced to Sarah Kellen,who led her up the flight of stairs to the room with the massage table. In thisroom, Epstein told Jane to take off her clothes and give him a massage. Janekept her panties and bra on and complied with Epstein’s instructions. Epsteinwore only a towel around his waste [sic]. After a short period of time, Epsteinremoved the towel and rolled over exposing his penis. Epstein began tomasturbate and he sexually assaulted Jane.After Epstein had completed the assault, Jane was then able to get dressed,leave the room and go back down the stairs. Jane was paid $200 by Epstein. Theyoung girl who recruited Jane was paid $100 by Epstein for bringing Jane to him.As a result of this encounter with Epstein, Jane experienced confusion, shame,humiliation and embarrassment, and has suffered severe psychological andemotional injuries."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 51 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter051]Jeffrey Epstein: June 30, 2008On June 30, 2008, more than three years after the start of Officer Pagan’sinvestigation into his dealings with underage girls, Jeffrey Epstein reported tothe Palm Beach County jail.A few days earlier, Epstein had taken a phone call from the New York Times. Atthe time, he’d been working, or vacationing (the line having long sinceblurred), at his compound on Little Saint Jeff’s.“I respect the legal process,” Epstein had said. “I will abide by this.”He’d spent years fighting the charges—fighting the state, then the federalgovernment, in an effort to avoid a sentence that would have seen him emergefrom prison an old man. But the battle had aged him. Mellowed him, even. Monthsearlier, he had all but boasted to a journalist from New York magazine.“It’s the Icarus story, someone who flies too close to the sun,” that journalistsaid in reference to “the agony” of Epstein’s legal “ordeal.”“Did Icarus like massages?” Epstein responded.But after Epstein’s indictment, there were no more boasts. For the most part, hekept silent in public and retreated into his Eyes Wide Shut world. And when theNew York Times did manage to get him to speak on the record, he spoke like achastened man.Sitting on his patio down on Little St. James, Epstein likened himself to theshipwrecked Gulliver after he washes ashore on Lilliput.“Gulliver’s playfulness had unintended consequences,” he said.On the eve of his departure, he had a few more things to say:“That is what happens with wealth. There are unexpected burdens as well asbenefits….”“Your body can be confined, but not your mind….”“I am not blameless….”Outside of the agreement he’d signed with the prosecutor’s office, this was theclosest Epstein had come to admitting his guilt. But strange details weresprinkled throughout the story. He had formed a “board of directors of friends”who would counsel him on his behavior. And, seemingly for the first time, he’dhired a full-time masseur—a man.Readers of the New York Times might have wondered: Epstein was going to jail foreighteen months. What need would he have for a full-time masseur?The story’s last line hinted at the answer: in preparation for incarceration,Epstein had set up an e-mail alert.From then on, his automatic reply would read “On vacation.”"},{"pageContent":"PART V [part0123.xhtml#toc-part005]INCARCERATION [part0123.xhtml#toc-part005]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 52 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter052]Jeffrey Epstein: June 30, 2008The Palm Beach County Main Detention Center is on the west side of Lake WorthLagoon, which separates West Palm Beach from the island of Palm Beach. Epstein’shome on El Brillo Way is five miles to the east. Mary’s high school is severalmiles to the west.It’s fitting, somehow, that this jail—which is the jail Epstein ends up in,after turning himself in to the local sheriff—lies in between the two points.The detention center’s inmates, their families, and their lawyers call it theGun Club, a reference not only to the jail’s address, on Gun Club Road, but alsoto its population of hustlers, burglars, drug dealers, rapists, and murderers.There’s the occasional hooker as well. And, from time to time, Haitian refugeesare lodged there.There are three thousand inmates in all.Some wait a year before making their way to the courthouse, their date with thepublic defender, and an appearance before the judge. Some get out much sooner,if only they can make bail. But there’s no bail without money—or at leastcollateral—and, of course, being without money is often what lands people injail in the first place.Jeffrey Epstein could have posted bail for every single inmate in the Gun Club.But that’s just one of the ways in which Epstein is unlike his fellow inmates.He’s an admitted pedophile now. Even a famous one.And, famously, pedophiles tend to fare poorly in jail.Luckily for Epstein, Ric Bradshaw, the sheriff in charge of local jails,transfers Epstein to the infirmary, where he spends exactly one night beforebeing transferred seven miles up the road to a much smaller, safer location: thePalm Beach County Central Detention Center—or, as it’s known, the Stockade.“It’s not somewhere we’d put a serial killer,” Ric Bradshaw says.Most of the residents here are addicts who take part in drug education programs,prostitutes, petty criminals, and drunks. It’s a far safer place for Epstein tobe, and, unlike other inmates (except, of course, those being held in solitary),he’ll end up with his own cell, even his own wing, which he has to himself.Epstein’s allowed to pay for a security guard, who sits outside the cell andkeeps watch. And he’s allowed any number of visitors.For a convicted felon, it’s an extraordinary benefits package.But according to Sheriff Bradshaw, who also oversees the Stockade, Epstein isincredulous over the treatment he is receiving.“He was astonished that he had to go to prison at all,” Bradshaw remembers.“Let’s just say he didn’t think he belonged there.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 53 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter053]Sheriff Ric Bradshaw: June 2015Our job,” says Ric Bradshaw, “was to make sure nobody killed him.”Sheriff Bradshaw could have stepped off the set of a Western. Imposingly tall,with his cowboy hat, Kurt Russell mustache, and slow, southern drawl, he looksexactly like an old-school law officer—the kind you once would have foundpatrolling the streets of Tombstone, Deadwood, or Dodge City. He’s been a lawmanfor forty-four years, eleven of which have been spent as the head of thecounty’s jails. As a rule, he doesn’t talk to the media, and today, as he talksabout Jeffrey Epstein, he’s clearly uncomfortable, fidgety, and ill disposed.But here in his wood-paneled office on the first floor of the Gun Club, Bradshawremembers Epstein quite well.“We have a thousand sexual predators in the county,” he says. “When he arrivedhere, he was one of them. He definitely fit the category we have to ensure thegeneral population is not going to take their anger out on.”Although he understands that Epstein is a sex offender and has a sense of thescope of his alleged crimes, Bradshaw’s also aware that the actual convictionwas for a “low-level felony.” At the request of Epstein’s attorneys—a requestthat is confirmed by a court order—Epstein is quickly granted “work release.”What it means in practice is that six days a week, for up tosixteen—sixteen!—hours each day, Epstein is allowed to leave the Stockade to bedriven by a designated driver in a car earmarked especially for him to any oneof three places: his lawyer Jack Goldberger’s office in downtown West PalmBeach, the Palm Beach office of a science foundation that he’s established, andhis house on El Brillo Way.Despite the ankle bracelet he wears, it could be argued that as a fabulouslyrich prisoner with two of his own jets parked nearby, at the Palm BeachInternational Airport, Epstein might have posed a flight risk.Instead, every day of the week save one, he’s allowed to go to his lawyer’s, togo to his office, or simply to go home.Did the deputy in charge of Epstein go to the house on El Brillo Way?Ric Bradshaw considers the question.“Yes,” he says, “he did.”Did the deputy go inside the house?“Yes, he did.”If so, the deputy might have encountered Nadia Marcinkova, who was staying on ElBrillo Way at the time. He may also have met a suave short-haired gentleman whospoke with a distinct French accent.That would be Jean-Luc Brunel.For the duration of Jeffrey Epstein’s stay—or half stay—in the Stockade,Brunel’s taken up residence in the house on El Brillo Way."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 54 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter054]Jeffrey Epstein: June 30, 2008–July 21, 2009According to Sheriff Ric Bradshaw, the treatment Jeffrey Epstein received in theStockade was not preferential. By some measures, he isn’t wrong.In 2010, millionaire polo mogul John Goodman killed a young man while drivingdrunk. He was convicted but was allowed to spend two years under house arrestwhile his appeal was being tried.Like Epstein, Goodman was allowed visitors. But Goodman’s visitor list wasnothing like Jeffrey Epstein’s.Nadia Marcinkova is said to have visited Epstein in jail more than seventytimes.Epstein’s assistant Sarah Kellen also visited Epstein in the Stockade.A Russian mixed martial artist named Igor “Houdini” Zinoviev was anothervisitor, as was a disbarred lawyer and financial fraudster named ArnoldProsperi, whose own prison sentence had been commuted by Bill Clinton on the daybefore Clinton left office.Sheriff Bradshaw wants to be clear: none of these visits was conjugal.But even US attorney Acosta, who negotiated Epstein’s unusual agreement with thegovernment, would say that Epstein’s arrangement was highly irregular.“Epstein appears to have received highly unusual treatment while in jail,”Acosta would say in a letter addressed to the general public. “Although theterms of confinement in a state prison are a matter appropriately left to thestate of Florida and not federal authorities, without doubt, the treatment thathe received while in state custody undermined the purpose of a jail sentence.”And, of course, Epstein’s stay at the Stockade was subsidized by taxpayers."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 55 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter055]R. Alexander Acosta’s letter to the general public, March 20, 2011To whom it may concern:I served as U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida from 2005through 2009. Over the past weeks, I have read much regarding Mr. JeffreyEpstein. Some appears true, some appears distorted. I thought it appropriate toprovide some background, with two caveats: (i) under Justice Departmentguidelines, I cannot discuss privileged internal communications among departmentattorneys and (ii) I no longer have access to the original documents, and as thematter is now nearly 4 years old, the precision of memory is reduced.The Epstein matter was originally presented to the Palm Beach County StateAttorney. Palm Beach Police alleged that Epstein unlawfully hired underagehigh-school females to provide him sexually lewd and erotic massages. Policesought felony charges that would have resulted in a term of imprisonment.According to press reports, however, in 2006 the State Attorney, in part due toconcerns regarding the quality of the evidence, agreed to charge Epstein onlywith one count of aggravated assault with no intent to commit a felony. Thatcharge would have resulted in no jail time, no requirement to register as asexual offender and no restitution for the underage victims.Local police were dissatisfied with the State Attorney’s conclusions, andrequested a federal investigation. Federal authorities received the State’sevidence and engaged in additional investigation. Prosecutors weighed thequality of the evidence and the likelihood for success at trial. With a federalcase, there were two additional considerations. First, a federal criminalprosecution requires that the crime be more than local; it must have aninterstate nexus. Second, as the matter was initially charged by the state, thefederal responsibility is, to some extent, to back-stop state authorities toensure that there is no miscarriage of justice, and not to also prosecutefederally that which has already been charged at the state level.After considering the quality of the evidence and the additional considerations,prosecutors concluded that the state charge was insufficient. In early summer2007, the prosecutors and agents in this case met with Mr. Epstein’s attorney,Roy Black. Mr. Black is perhaps best known for his successful defense of WilliamKennedy Smith. The prosecutors presented Epstein a choice: plead to more seriousstate felony charges (that would result in 2 years’ imprisonment, registrationas a sexual offender, and restitution for the victims) or else prepare for afederal felony trial.What followed was a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors. Iuse the word assault intentionally, as the defense in this case was moreaggressive than any which I, or the prosecutors in my office, had previouslyencountered. Mr. Epstein hired an army of legal superstars: Harvard ProfessorAlan Dershowitz, former Judge and then Pepperdine Law Dean Kenneth Starr, formerDeputy Assistant to the President and then Kirkland & Ellis Partner JayLefkowitz, and several others, including prosecutors who had formerly worked inthe U.S. Attorney’s Office and in the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Sectionof the Justice Department. Defense attorneys next requested a meeting with me tochallenge the prosecution and the terms previously presented by the prosecutorsin their meeting with Mr. Black. The prosecution team and I met with defensecounsel in Fall 2007, and I reaffirmed the office’s position: two years,registration and restitution, or trial.Over the next several months, the defense team presented argument after argumentclaiming that felony criminal proceedings against Epstein were unsupported bythe evidence and lacked a basis in law, and that the office’s insistence onjail-time was motivated by a zeal to overcharge a man merely because he iswealthy. They bolstered their arguments with legal opinions from well-knownlegal experts. One member of the defense team warned me that the office’s excesszeal in forcing a good man to serve time in jail might be the subject of a bookif we continued to proceed with the matter. My office systematically consideredand rejected each argument, and when we did, my office’s decisions were appealedto Washington. As to the warning, I ignored it.The defense strategy was not limited to legal issues. Defense counselinvestigated individual prosecutors and their families, looking for personalpeccadilloes that may provide a basis for disqualification. Disqualifying aprosecutor is an effective (though rarely used) strategy, as eliminating theindividuals most familiar with the facts and thus most qualified to take a caseto trial harms likelihood for success. Defense counsel tried to disqualify atleast two prosecutors. I carefully reviewed, and then rejected, these arguments.Despite the army of attorneys, the office held firm to the terms first presentedto Mr. Black in the original meeting. On June 30, 2008, after yet another lastminute appeal to Washington D.C. was rejected, Epstein pled guilty in statecourt. He was to serve 18 months imprisonment, register as a sexual offender forlife, and provide restitution to the victims.Some may feel that the prosecution should have been tougher. Evidence that hascome to light since 2007 may encourage that view. Many victims have since spokenout, filing detailed statements in civil cases seeking damages. Physicalevidence has since been discovered. Had these additional statements and evidencebeen known, the outcome may have been different. But they were not known to usat the time.A prosecution decision must be based on admissible facts known at the time. Incases of this type, those are unusually difficult because victims are frightenedand often decline to testify or if they do speak, they give contradictorystatements. Our judgment in this case, based on the evidence known at the time,was that it was better to have a billionaire serve time in jail, register as asex offender, and pay his victims restitution than risk a trial with a reducedlikelihood of success. I supported that judgment then, and based on the statelaw as it then stood and the evidence known at the time, I would support thatjudgment again.Epstein’s treatment, while in state custody, likewise may encourage the viewthat the office should have been tougher. Although the terms of confinement in astate prison are a matter appropriately left to the State of Florida, and notfederal authorities, without doubt, the treatment that he received while instate custody undermined the purpose of a jail sentence.Some may also believe that the prosecution should have been tougher inretaliation for the defense’s tactics. The defense, arguably, often failed tonegotiate in good faith. They would obtain concessions as part of a negotiationand agree to proceed, only to change their minds, and appeal the office’sposition to Washington. The investigations into the family lives of individualprosecutors were, in my opinion, uncalled for, as were the accusations of biasand/or misconduct against individual prosecutors. At times, some prosecutorsfelt that we should just go to trial, and at times I felt that frustrationmyself. What was right in the first meeting, however, remained rightirrespective of defense tactics. Individuals have a constitutional right to adefense. The aggressive exercise of that right should not be punished, norshould a defense counsel’s exercise of their right to appeal a U.S Attorney toWashington D.C. Prosecutors must be careful not to allow frustration and angerwith defense counsel to influence their judgment.After the plea, I recall receiving several phone calls. One was from the FBISpecial Agent-In-Charge. He called to offer congratulations. He had been at manyof the meetings regarding this case. He was aware of the tactics of the defense,and he called to praise our prosecutors for holding firm against the likes ofMessrs. Black, Dershowitz, Lefkowitz and Starr. It was a proud moment. I alsoreceived calls or communications from Messrs. Dershowitz, Lefkowitz and Starr. Ihad known all three individuals previously, from my time in law school and atKirkland & Ellis in the mid 90s. They all sought to make peace. I agreed to talkand meet with each of them after Epstein pled guilty, as I think it importantthat prosecutors battle defense attorneys in a case and then move on. I havetried, yet I confess that this has been difficult to do fully in this case.The bottom line is this: Mr. Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire, served time in jailand is now a registered sexual offender. He has been required to pay his victimsrestitution, though restitution clearly cannot compensate for the crime. And weknow much more today about his crimes because victims have come forward to speakout. Some may disagree with prosecutorial judgments made in this case, but thoseindividuals are not the ones who at the time reviewed the evidence available fortrial and assessed the likelihood of success.Respectfully,R.

One of the concessions hislawyers have gotten while working out his plea-deal guarantees is that the medianot be alerted to the time and day of his departure.But from now on, Epstein, who is fifty-six, will carry the mark of a level 3 sexoffender—level 1 being the lowest, and level 3 indicating the highest possiblerisk of a future criminal act of a sexual nature. Wherever he goes, he will beforced to register as such.Every ninety days, Epstein will have to check in with the authorities. Everyyear, the New York City Police Department will take his mug shot. And for a fullyear, Epstein will be under house arrest in Palm Beach.This last prohibition doesn’t stop him from flying, with court approval, on hisown planes to New York and to Little Saint Jeff’s, where the locals have takento referring to Epstein’s 727 as the Lolita Express.There are other restrictions, of course, that Epstein is supposed to abide by.He has to provide the state of Florida with a list of all the motor vehicles,boats, and airplanes he owns. The full list includes two Escalades, sixSuburbans, two Ford F-150s, two Harley-Davidsons, a Land Rover, a Hummer H2, athirty-four-foot JVC boat, and a thirty-five-foot Donzi powerboat.Three of his five planes turn out to be registered to a company called AirGhislaine, Inc.As a registered sex offender, Epstein is legally obliged to undergo psychiatrictreatment. This is a restriction he’ll get around by having his own psychologistsubmit a report to law enforcement officers.Epstein is also prohibited from accessing pornography on the Internet and usingsocial networking for sexual purposes.For Jeffrey Epstein, there will be no Bangbros, Tinder, or Swingles.com.There will be lawsuits.Six weeks before probation ends, he settles with seven women who sue him incivil court. But Epstein can easily afford the settlement payments. He won’t begoing back to jail, and in regard to further prosecution for any criminalactions, his troubles are behind him.Not everyone who’s spent time in his company will be so lucky."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 57 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter057]Alfredo Rodriguez: August 2009Epstein’s houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez, also ends up with a prison sentence.In a sworn statement, Rodriguez talks about Epstein’s maid, Lupita, who hadcomplained to him about having to clean up after Epstein’s “massages.” Lupita,who was a devout Catholic, had cried as she described the stained towel and sextoys.Rodriguez was fired by Epstein, he says, when he called 911 after seeing astrange car—a “beater”—in Epstein’s driveway.As it turned out, the car had belonged to one of Epstein’s masseuses.On his way out of the house on El Brillo Way, he took some of Epstein’s papers,which he failed to produce when questioned by Chief Reiter’s investigators.For years, Rodriguez tried and failed to find work as a house manager. No onewanted to hire someone who’d worked for Jeffrey Epstein. Finally, desperately,he tried to sell the information he’d stolen.The papers named underage girls and the places where Epstein had taken them. Thelist included locations in California, Paris, New Mexico, New York, andMichigan. The papers also included the names, addresses, and phone numbers offamous individuals—Henry Kissinger, Mick Jagger, Dustin Hoffman, Ralph Fiennes,David Koch, Ted Kennedy, Donald Trump, Bill Richardson, Bill Clinton, and formerIsraeli prime minister Ehud Barak among them.This was intriguing, if not at all damning. Epstein made a habit of collectingsuch information for future use. But information pertaining to the girls wouldhave bolstered the state’s case against Jeffrey Epstein, and by withholding itfrom the Palm Beach PD and the FBI, Rodriguez had committed a crime.In his defense, Rodriguez would say that the papers were an “insurance policy.”Without them, he believed, Epstein would have made him “disappear.”But now Rodriguez needed the money. And so a few weeks after Epstein’s releasefrom the Stockade, he approached a lawyer who was representing some of Epstein’smasseuses. He had the “holy grail,” he insisted. A “golden nugget.” The names ofhundreds of girls, he said, who had been abused by Epstein.The lawyer told Rodriguez in no uncertain terms that he was obliged to turnwhatever he had over to the authorities. By demanding money for the information,Rodriguez was committing another crime.According to a sworn statement by Christina Pryor, a special agent with the FBI,Rodriguez “persisted that he would only turn over the information in hispossession in exchange for $50,000.”Two months later, on October 28, the lawyer called Rodriguez, who insisted oncemore on being paid for the information. The lawyer told him that an associatewould be in touch.What the lawyer knew and Rodriguez did not know was that the associate inquestion was an undercover employee (UCE) of the FBI. A few days later, onNovember 2, the UCE calls Rodriguez and sets up a meeting, which takes place thefollowing day.“During the meeting, Rodriguez produced a small bound book and several sheets oflegal pad paper containing handwritten notes,” Special Agent Pryor would say inher statement. She continues:Rodriguez explained that he had taken the bound book from his former employer’sresidence while employed there in 2004 to 2005 and that the book had beencreated by persons working for his former employer. Rodriguez discussed indetail the information within the book and identified important information tothe UCE. In addition, Rodriguez admitted he had previously lied to the FBI.Rodriguez asked the UCE about the $50,000, took possession of the money, andbegan counting it.Rodriguez was then detained for Obstruction of Official Proceedings, Title 18,U.S. Code, Section 1512(c), and questioned. After Miranda warnings wereadministered by agents, Rodriguez waived his rights and signed a written waiverof those rights. Rodriguez admitted that he had the documents and book in hispossession and had never turned them over to local law enforcement or the FBI.In addition, Rodriguez advised he had witnessed nude girls whom he believed wereunderage at the pool area of his former employer’s home, knew that his formeremployer was engaging in sexual contact with underage girls, and had viewedpornographic images of underage girls on computers in his employer’s home.Rodriguez was then released from custody for further investigation.The items that Rodriguez had attempted to sell to the UCE for $50,000.00 werereviewed by an agent familiar with the underlying criminal investigation. AsRodriguez had described, the items contained information material to theunderlying investigation that would have been extremely useful ininvestigati[ng] and prosecuting the case, including the names and contactinformation of material witnesses and additional victims. Had those items beenproduced in response to the inquiries of the state law enforcement officers orthe FBI Special Agents, their contents would have been presented to the federalgrand jury.Following his release, Alfredo Rodriguez was arrested again. He appeared incourt on June 18, 2010, facing charges of corruptly concealing records anddocuments. Dressed in a blue jumpsuit and shackles, he apologized for his crimesand asked the court to be merciful.He received a sentence of eighteen months.It was the same punishment that Jeffrey Epstein had gotten for his crimes. Butunlike Epstein, Alfredo Rodriguez served his time in a federal prison and didnot ask for, or receive, permission to go on work release."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 58 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter058]Prince Andrew: 2011Prince Andrew also fares poorly in the wake of Epstein’s imprisonment.The two men are old friends. They have been ever since Ghislaine Maxwellintroduced the prince to her then-beau, sometime in the 1990s. In 2000, Epsteinhad been invited to Windsor Castle to celebrate the queen’s birthday. Six monthslater, Epstein flew to Sandringham, the queen’s estate in Norfolk, England, fora party Prince Andrew threw for Ghislaine’s thirty-ninth birthday.The prince had also visited Epstein on several occasions, in Palm Beach as wellas in New York. And if allegations Virginia Roberts made in her 2015 declarationare to be believed, Epstein asked her to give the prince whatever he required,then report back with the details.According to the Guardian, Epstein and the prince had partied together atWindsor Castle, in Saint-Tropez, and in Thailand, where “Andrew was pictured ona yacht surrounded by topless women.”According to Roberts’s lawsuit, Epstein had forced her into the prince’s bed onLittle Saint Jeff’s.After Epstein’s conviction, the British press were using another name for LittleSaint Jeff’s: Sex Island. The Guardian reported that the manager of two VirginIslands–based corporations owned by Epstein happened to be the wife of thegovernor of the Virgin Islands. There were allegations involving amillion-dollar donation that Epstein had made to the governor’s reelectioncampaign. And then there was Roberts’s claim that she had been forced to havesex with the prince on the island as well as in New York and in London.Invariably, the photograph of Prince Andrew with his arm around the bare midriffof a very young-looking Virginia Roberts ran with stories that appeared in thetabloids.“It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contactor relationship” with Roberts, Buckingham Palace spokespersons would say. “Theallegations made are false and without any foundation.”The prince’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, while on a skiingtrip with the prince and their daughter Eugenie in Switzerland, told reporters,“He is the greatest man there is. It was the finest moment of my life in 1986when I married him. He is a great man, the best in the world.”“I won’t stand by—because I know what it feels like to have salacious lies madeup about you—and not support him so publicly because they are just shockinglyaccusatory allegations, which I don’t think is right,” she said a few days laterwhen interviewed by Today host Matt Lauer. “It’s a defamation of character, andas a great father and a humongously good man and all the work he does forBritain I won’t stand by and let him have his character defamed to this level.”But at the same time, a certain schadenfreude attended the good man’s fall fromgrace, and former associates kept coming out of the woodwork to dish to thepress.“I’ve seen him treat his staff in a shocking, appalling way,” said a former aideto the prince. “He’s been incredibly rude to his personal protection officers,literally throwing things on the ground and demanding they ‘fucking pick themup.’ No social graces at all. Sure, if you’re a lady with blond hair and bigboobs, then I bet he’s utterly charming.”Despite all this, the prince had stuck by Epstein. There was even a photo,frequently trotted out by the tabloids, of the two of them strolling in CentralPark.Some few months before it was taken, a reporter posing as a businessman hadsecretly taped Sarah Ferguson’s demand for five hundred thousand pounds inreturn for access to the prince.“If you want to meet him in your business,” she’d said then, “look after me, andhe’ll look after you. You’ll get it back tenfold.”“Once again,” she said afterward, “my errors have compounded and rebounded andalso impacted on the man I admire most in the world: the Duke.”Prince Andrew had had his troubles already—with shady real estate deals, stickyromances, highly embarrassing document dumps (courtesy of Julian Assange andWikiLeaks), and questionable ties to Tunisian oligarchs, corrupt presidents offormer Soviet republics, and Mu’ammar Gadhafi, among other entanglements, manyof which were explored in a Vanity Fair article headlined THE TROUBLE WITHANDREW.“The duke has a record of being loyal to his friends,” a “royal source” toldVanity Fair’s Edward Klein. “Take his feelings for Sarah Ferguson. If you are aprince and you bring a woman into the royal life and, for whatever reasons,she’s spit out, you might have feelings of debt toward her. The duke feels thatshe’s been spattered and rejected. His close relationship with the Duchess ofYork is problematic, and there have been many problems over the last 5 to 10years, all of which stem from the duchess. Some of the behavior of the duchessis inconsistent with being married to, or an ex-wife of, the duke. There’s noquestion but that Sarah’s been a financially self-destructive element in theduke’s life.”“The same kind of loyalty manifested itself last December, when the duke visitedEpstein at his home in New York,” said a spokesperson for Buckingham Palace.“Epstein was a friend of the duke’s for the best part of 20 years. It was thefirst time in four years that he’d seen Epstein. He now recognizes that themeeting in December was unwise.”“Don’t expect to see a photo of the two of them together,” another “royalsource” would say.But one more story about the prince’s dealings with Jeffrey Epstein had alreadyemerged.At a dinner party at Epstein’s town house, the prince dished about the weddingof his nephew Prince William to Kate Middleton.“He was amused that his dinner companions were so interested in every detail,” aguest in attendance told a New York Post gossip columnist. “What would Katewear, what would the Queen wear, would his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson be invited?”Other guests in attendance that night included Chelsea Handler, GeorgeStephanopoulos, Charlie Rose, Katie Couric, and Woody Allen.At around the same time, Jeffrey Epstein told the New York Post, “I’m not asexual predator, I’m an ‘offender.’ It’s the difference between a murderer and aperson who steals a bagel.”Was it so remarkable that Prince Andrew would have been seen in Epstein’scompany? Andrew’s philandering had been tabloid fodder for years. Randy Andy,they called him in the UK. And in the circles that Jeffrey Epstein moved in,philandering wasn’t seen as a vice. Epstein came of age just as industrywidederegulation took hold on Wall Street. Junk bonds were king. Call girls werecharging ten thousand dollars a night. And in the shadows, you’d see things thatwould have made Caligula blush. Sights that would make Nero himself reach forthe nearest fire extinguisher. When the urge presented itself, the new superrich didn’t have to swap wives.They could simply swap harems.By the same token, was it so very strange to think that a man like the princewould have grown so detached from reality—insofar as reality is even a word thatapplies to a prince? Was it odd that he thought it was absolutely fine to beseen by photographers strolling through Central Park with a registered sexoffender—when at the time large swaths of the financial, banking, and tradingindustries were characterized by their very detachment from day-to-day concernssuch as morality, ethics, and appearances?As for Jeffrey Epstein, one question that might be worth asking is, if he’s infact a narcissist and megalomaniac, could he actually believe that he’sinnocent? Then again, that might be the wrong question. Epstein did pleadguilty, after all. But what if he simply doesn’t see what he pleaded to as acrime? What if he’s proud of his lifestyle? And if that’s the case, why wouldn’tPrince Andrew be proud to be seen in public with his dear friend JeffreyEpstein?What if, for people like Epstein and the prince, it’s just servants and masters,the way of the world? They’re natural winners—aristocrats, after all—and if lifewere fair, well, how would we know who the real winners are?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 59 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter059]Anna Salter: November 2015Why do powerful men do the things that Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Andrew havebeen accused of doing?Dr. Anna Salter studies child sex offenders professionally. Educated at Harvard,with a graduate degree in clinical psychology, she spoke, with the benefit ofhindsight, about Jeffrey Epstein and others like him from her office in Madison,Wisconsin.“Consider a car,” says Dr. Salter. “There’s a motor, and there are brakes. Weall have sexual impulses we don’t think it would be a good idea to act on. Mostof us have good control over our behavior. We have good brakes.“Sexual offenses and inappropriate sexual behavior are sometimes the result of abad motor—for example, an attraction to prepubescent children oreleven-to-fourteen-year-old pubescent children as opposed to postpubescentindividuals. But they are always the result of bad brakes.“Antisocial psychopaths don’t have brakes at all.”Dr. Salter has never met Epstein, but she’s followed his case closely and findshim a familiar type. She’s especially struck by the singular nature of therelationship between powerful, wealthy men and vulnerable, underage women.“[The men] are more impressive to a fourteen-year-old [girl] than to, say, anadult young woman who is self-supporting and feels more sure of herself,” sheexplains.“They are attracted to what they call freshness—barely budding sexuality andlack of sexual experience. The difference between them and their victims feedstheir ego.“Great wealth and access are generally factors that make men feel they areentitled to whomever and whatever they want. Some have narcissisticpersonalities with inflated self-images. And of course, great wealth and statusmake such men think they can get away with it. Too often, they’re right.”On the other hand, Dr. Salter believes that certain conditions, such as the onesexhibited by Jeffrey Epstein, might be an inborn character trait.Personality can be influenced, sometimes quite heavily, by genetics.“Virtually no one believes anymore that humans are born a totally blank slate,”she explains.“We arrive with temperamental and personality variations that, of course, theenvironment can often, but not always, influence. We arrive with baggage.”Is Epstein a born psychopath, then?“Psychopathy is the umbrella term for individuals who do not have a conscience.Psychopaths are often narcissistic, but narcissists are often not psychopathic.Some individuals who prey on young girls delude themselves into thinking thatthe abuse will not harm the child. They have a conscience, but they havemedicated it with thinking errors. Others are flat-out psychopathic and simplydon’t care if it hurts the young girl or not. I can’t say anything aboutEpstein, as I have not evaluated him, but narcissism and psychopathy areconcepts an evaluator would look at concerning anyone who was sexually attractedto postpubescent individuals but who then began to focus on younger teens.“Psychopaths are often superficially charming, high-stimulus seekers who arebored if not doing something. They lie, con, and manipulate. They do notestablish deep affective ties.“They are callous and remorseless individuals who simply don’t feel bad aboutharming someone.“Rules don’t apply to them because they are exceptional. They are sure theywon’t get caught.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 60 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter060]Jeffrey Epstein: July 2010Jeffrey Epstein was done with jail, but he wasn’t done settling suits brought byhis victims. Under the conditions of his non-prosecution agreement, he’s evenpaid for the victims’ lawyers. Still, Epstein’s NPA seemed to ensure that hewould not be prosecuted again for his crimes. Double jeopardy was working inEpstein’s favor. But in July of 2010, reports began to appear in the press:federal investigators were following other leads—leads that could result inchild-trafficking charges and a twenty-year sentence.The Florida attorney general’s office refused to comment. It was against policyto confirm or deny the existence of an ongoing investigation. One of Epstein’slawyers told the Daily Beast that he had no knowledge of such an investigation.“Jeffrey Epstein has fully complied with all state and federal requirements thatarise from the prior proceedings in Palm Beach,” Jack Goldberger said. “Thereare no pending civil lawsuits. There are not and should not be any pendinginvestigations, given Mr. Epstein’s complete fulfillment of all the terms of hisnon-prosecution agreement with the federal government.”If there was an investigation, nothing had come of it yet. For the moment,Epstein was free—free to turn his attention, again, to intellectual pursuits. Helaunched a website, JeffreyEpsteinScience.com, that featured blog posts such as“Conversations with Jeffrey Epstein,” “The Value of Quantum Computation toJeffrey Epstein,” “Why Evolutionary Biology Intrigues Jeffrey Epstein,” and “AnUnderstanding of Theoretical Physics from Jeffrey Epstein.” The latter postbegan: “This is where Jeffrey Epstein takes you to the very cutting edge of thefrontiers of knowledge to explore and discuss our basic understanding of thesubtle, simple, and hidden [qualities] that lie beneath…our universe.”“Jeffrey doesn’t know shit about science,” says Stuart Pivar, the art collectorwho has known Epstein for more than three decades. “Does he like to act like hedoes? Yes. But he doesn’t. But as far as these academic scientists—withoutpeople like him they wouldn’t have any money.”Other friends of Epstein’s say that he truly did have a brilliant mind forscience. And in any case, Epstein had done more than sponsor individualscientists. He’d also sponsored conferences on Little Saint Jeff’s. On hiswebsite, he announced a conference called Mindshift at which Nobel laureates,such as the theoretical physicist Murray Gell-Mann, would mix with surgeons,engineers, and futurists and where professors would discuss cognitiveneuroscience, artificial intelligence, systems of encryption and decryption, andother topics.Epstein had been hosting get-togethers like this for years. Toward the end ofChief Reiter’s investigation, in March of 2006, Epstein had hosted twenty topphysicists—including three Nobel Prize winners as well as the celebrityphysicist Stephen Hawking—at a Saint Thomas symposium called “ConfrontingGravity,” which was advertised as “a workshop to explore fundamental questionsin physics and cosmology.”“This is a remarkable group,” one of the Nobel Prize winners told a reporter forthe St. Thomas Source.“There is no agenda except fun and physics, and that’s fun with a capital F,”Epstein said.Epstein had been especially interested in Stephen Hawking. Someday, Hawking hadtheorized, the universe would stop expanding and collapse, at which point timewould begin to run backwards. Hawking believed that computer viruses were livingthings. He thought that given the size of the universe, alien life formsexisted. He did not believe in God. But he had a vast appreciation for the innerworkings of the universe, and this is why Epstein gave Hawking a tremendousgift. He paid to have a submarine modified so that it could fit Hawking and hiswheelchair and give the scientist his first glimpse of an actual alien world—theone that lies under the waves of the ocean.It was one of the most romantic, generous gestures that Jeffrey Epstein had evermade."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 61 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter061]Al Seckel: January 2012Epstein’s partner in the Mindshift conference, a man named Al Seckel, was knownfor throwing fabulous parties that were said to have included the actor DudleyMoore, magician James “the Amazing” Randi, and future Tesla and SpaceX founderElon Musk, as well as many of the scientists Jeffrey Epstein would court in thecourse of his own climb up the social ladder.In certain Los Angeles circles, Al Seckel was a very good man to know. But, likeJeffrey Epstein, Seckel was a sort of illusionist. According to MarkOppenheimer, a journalist who knew Seckel and followed his career for fifteenyears, Seckel made his money by selling rare books and papers, often through hissocial and academic connections.“A number of these transactions resulted in accusations and lawsuits,”Oppenheimer would write. “In speaking to former Seckel acquaintances, I kepthearing variations on a scheme Mrs. Pearce Williams believed he perpetratedagainst her late husband, the man Seckel said was his mentor. Seckel took booksand promised money, or he took money and promised a book; but somehow, thepromised party lost money.”“He was charming, erudite, humorous,” one of Seckel’s marks told the reporter.“I lent him $75,000. When the time came to pay it back he didn’t want to do it.”Oppenheimer found several people whom Seckel had stiffed and uncovered dozens oflawsuits he’d been involved in. In 2007, Seckel settled a libel lawsuit againsta man who’d edited his Wikipedia page. Years later, Oppenheimer spoke withSeckel’s lawyer, Nicholas Hornberger.“Hornberger confirmed that he’d reached a settlement for the case, a favorableone,” the journalist wrote. “Hornberger added that Seckel has still not paid himfor his services.”He also interviewed Seckel’s wife, Isabel Maxwell.Al and Isabel met on a blind date and married in Malibu in or “around” 2007 (“Idon’t keep the dates in my head,” Seckel explained). A few years later, theymoved to the South of France, where Seckel continued to trade in rare books andpapers. While living in France, he was sued by a Virgin Islands company thataccused him and Isabel of fraudulently attempting to sell rare books and aseventeenth-century portrait of Isaac Newton.Seckel had also been trying to sell papers belonging to Isabel’s father.Isabel is Ghislaine Maxwell’s sister and the daughter of Robert Maxwell.It was an odd thing, Epstein’s association with this self-professed PhD who, oncloser inspection, turned out to be a bit of a grifter. But the Mindshiftconference that Epstein and Seckel hosted in the Virgin Islands did take place,in 2010. Murray Gell-Mann was there, along with Leonard Mlodinow, a physicistwho coauthored books with Stephen Hawking. Gerald Sussman, an expert onartificial intelligence who taught at MIT and also attended the conference, saidthat he didn’t remember too much about it.“We had scientific discussions, talked about various things,” he said vaguely.When Mark Oppenheimer asked him if he’d given money to Seckel, Sussman “gottesty” with the reporter.“I have had some dealings with him,” Sussman said. “I don’t want to say whatit’s about, because I don’t feel good about it, okay?”Today, Epstein’s websites—JeffreyEpsteinFoundation.com andJeffreyEpsteinScience.com—are down. Their domain names have long since expired.Several recipients of Epstein’s charitable contributions, including New York’sMount Sinai Hospital and Ballet Palm Beach, announced that they would not beaccepting new gifts.“The further I can keep myself from anything like that the better,” said BalletPalm Beach founder Colleen Smith.But in 2012, Epstein held one more conference on Little Saint Jeff’s. Onceagain, three Nobel Prize winners were in attendance. Stephen Hawking was alsothere. All in all, Epstein had gathered twenty-one physicists—from Princeton,Harvard, MIT, and CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research)—to“determine what the consensus is, if any, for defining gravity.”According to a press release issued by Epstein’s foundation, the consensus thatdid emerge was that space is “not quite empty.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 62 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter062]Jeffrey Epstein: February 2, 2011It’s Groundhog Day, and once-reclusive Jeffrey Epstein is hitting the peak ofhis fame in a ripped-from-the-headlines episode of Law & Order: SVU that tracks,eerily well, with his own legal history.The setup for this episode is the rape of a very young French girl. One who’sbeen flown to New York on a very rich man’s private jet, then flown back—coachclass—to Paris.On the plane, she has a freak-out. She thinks the middle-aged guy sitting nextto her is trying to rape her. In Paris, the local police get involved.“It was just a birthday party,” the tearful girl tells the SVU cops viavideoconference from France. “We were his present.”The cops ask: Whose present?“The billionaire. The one who owns the jet.”Does the French girl know his name?“Jordan. He wanted a massage. But I had to take off my clothes. He climbed ontop of me. It hurt. I started to bleed, and it wouldn’t stop. The doctor came.”“Dominique,” the cops say. “We’re going to arrest this man. But we need you toreturn to New York so you can testify.”“Non,” says the girl. “Non! Jamais! Jamais!”For Epstein, there are other embarrassments, many of which have to do with hisroyal friends. The wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton is approaching,and the ongoing troubles of Prince William’s uncle Prince Andrew keepthreatening to derail the festivities. On March 6, a spokesperson for SarahFerguson confirms that Epstein paid off part of the seventy-eight thousandpounds that the duchess borrowed from a man who was once her personal assistant.The next day, headlines appear in the Telegraph and other British papers: DUKEOF YORK “APPEALED TO JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO HELP DUCHESS PAY DEBT.”“I personally, on behalf of myself, deeply regret that Jeffrey Epstein becameinvolved in any way with me,” Prince Andrew’s ex-wife tells journalists. “Iabhor paedophilia and any sexual abuse of children and know that this was agigantic error of judgment on my behalf.“I am just so contrite I cannot say. Whenever I can I will repay the money andwill have nothing ever to do with Jeffrey Epstein ever again.”That week, as part of the ongoing civil lawsuits against Epstein, Sarah Kellenand Nadia Marcinkova are both asked about Prince Andrew’s relations withEpstein.“Would you agree with me that Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein used to shareunderaged girls for sexual relations?” Kellen is asked.“On the instructions of my lawyer,” Kellen replies, “I must invoke my FifthAmendment privilege.”“Have you ever been made to perform sexually on Prince Andrew?” lawyers askMarcinkova.“Fifth” is Nadia’s simple, succinct reply.That same week, the government downgrades Prince Andrew’s role as GreatBritain’s royal trade envoy.

Meanwhile, the FBI’s investigation into whether Epstein traffickedunderage women across state lines seems to be going nowhere. As 2014 draws to aclose, it’s beginning to look as if Epstein is finally free and clear of thecase.But for Epstein’s friend and sometime lawyer Alan Dershowitz, things are aboutto get very unpleasant.At the start of 2008, Bradley Edwards, the Fort Lauderdale lawyer, had filed amotion in a West Palm Beach court on behalf of two unnamed women accusing PrinceAndrew and Alan Dershowitz of participating directly in Epstein’s illegalactivities.Prince Andrew had had no comment to make, and Dershowitz had objected to theaccusations in the strongest possible terms.“There’s absolutely no kernel of truth to this story,” he’d said. “I don’t knowthis woman. I’ve never been in the same place with her. She’s made the wholestory up out of whole cloth.”Bradley Edwards had already become involved in lawsuits against Epstein. In2007, working with a former federal judge and University of Utah law professornamed Paul Cassell, he had filed a lawsuit on behalf of another unnamed woman.Six years later, that case is still pending, and now, Edwards and Cassellpetition to have the two suits combined.All in all, four Jane Does take part in the lawsuit.Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts, the girl who says that Ghislaine Maxwellrecruited her for Epstein at Trump’s resort, Mar-a-Lago.Epstein had “lent” her and other young girls to prominent businessmen, importantpoliticians, world leaders, and other powerful men in order “to ingratiatehimself with them for business, personal, political, and financial gain, as wellas to obtain blackmail information,” Roberts claims.She says that Epstein forced her and other underage girls to take part in anorgy in the Virgin Islands.She names Prince Andrew and Alan Dershowitz as two of the men she’d been forcedto have sex with and claims that Dershowitz had been “an eyewitness to thesexual abuse of many other minors by Epstein and several of Epstein’sco-conspirators.”This time, Prince Andrew does respond to the allegations.“This relates to longstanding and ongoing civil proceedings in the UnitedStates, to which the Duke of York is not a party,” Buckingham Palace says in ashort statement. “As such we would not comment on the detail. However, for theavoidance of doubt, any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors iscategorically untrue.”Alan Dershowitz also goes on the attack. Virginia’s claims are part of a plot toextort him, he claims. The motion that Edwards and Cassell have filed is “thesleaziest legal document” he’s ever seen.“They manipulated a young, suggestible woman who was interested in money,”Dershowitz says. “This is a disbarrable offense, and they will be disbarred.They will rue the day they ever made this false charge against me.” It’s avehement denial. But then, the allegations made by Virginia Roberts, on January15, 2015, in a declaration filed against the government in an attempt tooverturn Jeffrey Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement, are highly disturbing."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 64 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter064]Declaration of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, filed on January 19, 2015 by attorneysrepresenting Jeffrey Epstein’s victims (continued)20. Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz was around Epstein frequently.Dershowitz was so comfortable with the sex [that] was going on that on oneoccasion he observed me in sexual activity with Epstein.21. I had sexual intercourse with Dershowitz at least six times. The first timewas when I was about 16, early on in my servitude to Epstein, and it continueduntil I was 19.22. The first time we had sex took place in New York in Epstein’s home. It wasin Epstein’s room (not the massage room). I was approximately sixteen years oldat the time. I called Dershowitz “Alan.” I knew he was a famous professor.23. The second time that I had sex with Dershowitz was at Epstein’s house inPalm Beach.24. I also had sex with Dershowitz at Epstein’s Zorro Ranch in New Mexico in themassage room off of the indoor pool area, which was still being painted.25. We also had sex at Little Saint James Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.26. Another sexual encounter between me and Dershowitz happened on Epstein’sairplane. Another girl was present on the plane with us.27. I have recently seen Alan Dershowitz on television calling me a “liar.” Heis lying by denying that he had sex with me. The man I’ve seen on television,described as a former law professor, is the same man that I had sex with atleast six times. Dershowitz also knows that Epstein had sex with other underagegirls and lent me out to other people, but he is lying and denying that….28. After years of abuse and being lent out, I began to look for a way toescape. I had first gone into Epstein’s household because I wanted to be amassage therapist. Epstein had taken me into his clutches through promises andtalk and for some time I believed him. But once he had me under his control,regardless of my doubts and fears, I felt trapped.29. I kept asking Epstein for my promised training and education. Epsteinfinally got me a plane ticket to Thailand to go to Chiang Mai to learn Thaimassage. This sounded like my chance to escape. In September 2002, I packed mybags for good. I knew this would be my only opportunity to break away.30. On September 27, 2002, I flew from JFK in New York to Chiang Mai, Thailand.I arrived around September 29 for my training. But Epstein was going to getsomething out of this trip as well. I was supposed to interview a girl and bringher back to the United States for Epstein.31. [Left blank in the original]32. I did the massage training in Chiang Mai. While I was there, I met a greatand special guy and told him honestly what I was being forced to do. He told meI should get out of it. I told him that the people I was working for were verypowerful and that I could not walk away or disobey them without risking seriouspunishment, including my life. He told me he would protect me. I had confidence[in] him and I saw his love and help as my opportunity to escape and to be withsomeone who truly loved me and would protect me. I married him and flew toAustralia.33. I called Epstein and told him I was not coming back. He asked why? I said“I’ve fallen in love.” Epstein basically said “good luck and have a good life.”I could tell he was not happy. I was afraid of what he was going to do to me. Ithought he or one of his powerful friends might send someone to hurt me or haveme killed.34. From that point onward, out of concern for my safety and general well-being,I stayed in Australia with my husband. I was in Australia from late 2002 toOctober 2013. To be clear, I was never in the United States during these years,not even for a short trip to visit my mother. And my absence from the UnitedStates was not voluntary—I was hiding from Epstein out of fear of what he woulddo to me if I returned to the United States.35. In around 2007, after not hearing from anyone for years, out of the blue Iwas contacted by someone who identified himself with a plain sounding name andclaimed he was with the FBI. It seemed very odd for someone doing an officialcriminal investigation to just call up on the phone like that. I hadn’t heardEpstein’s name for years. I didn’t know who this person was and what it wasreally about. I couldn’t tell what was going on.36. This man said he was looking into Jeffrey Epstein. The man asked if I hadbeen involved with Epstein. My first instinct was to say nothing because Iwasn’t sure he was really with the FBI or any authorities. I answered a fewbasic questions, telling him that I knew Jeffrey Epstein and had met him at ayoung age. But the conversation didn’t feel right. This man never offered tocome and meet with me in person. Instead, he asked me right off the bat aboutEpstein’s sexual practices. I thought it would be strange for a true lawenforcement officer to behave that way, so I became increasingly uncomfortableand suspicious about who was actually calling me.37. I told the man nothing more about Epstein. The conversation probably didn’teven last three minutes, but it immediately triggered all of the fears ofEpstein and his powerful friends that had caused me to escape in the firstplace. If the call accomplished anything, it only put me back in a state of fearand told me that I could be found quite easily and had nobody officiallyprotecting me.38. I suspected that the man who called me was working for Epstein or one ofEpstein’s powerful friends. I believed that if this was really an agent who wasinvestigating Epstein, he would have known who I was and how I fit intoEpstein’s sexual crimes in many different places. He would have interviewed mein a way that would have established his credentials and would have shown how hecould provide potential protection from Epstein. That never happened.39. Getting a call from this supposed FBI agent made me scared all over again. Ihad left the old life of sexual slavery behind me and started a new life in anew country in hopes that the powerful people whose illegal activities I knewall about would never find me.40. Shortly after this purported FBI call, I was contacted by telephone bysomeone who appeared clearly to be working for Epstein. The caller told me aboutan investigation into Epstein and said that some of the girls being questionedwere saying that Epstein had had sexual contact with them. After they made theseallegations, the man said they were being discredited as drug addicts andprostitutes, but in my case, if I were to keep quiet, I would “be looked after.”The fact that this call was made shortly after the supposed FBI callreinfor[c]ed my concern that the man I had talked to earlier was not reallyworking for the FBI but for Epstein. I didn’t think that the FBI and Epsteinwould both be working together and would both get my phone number at almostexactly the same time. I played along and told this person that I had gotten acall from the “FBI” but that I didn’t tell him anything. The person on the phonewas pleased to hear [that].41. A short time later, one of Epstein’s lawyers (not Alan Dershowitz) calledme, and then got Epstein on the line at the same time. Epstein and his lawyerbasically asked again if I was going to say anything. The clear implication wasthat I should not. The way they were talking to me, I was afraid of what wouldhappen if I didn’t keep quiet. My thought was that if I didn’t say what theywanted me to say, or not to say, I might get hurt.42. I promised Epstein and his lawyer that I would keep quiet. They seemed happywith that and that seemed to me to [be the] way to keep me and my family safe.And I did what Epstein and his lawyer told me. I kept quiet.This declaration, stricken from the record by the judge in the victims’ lawsuitagainst the government, also set in motion events that led to Dershowitz’s andRoberts’s lawyers becoming involved in spectacular lawsuits, which included acomplaint by Dershowitz that these allegations were false and had defamed him,and a complaint by Edwards that Dershowitz’s accusations against him were falseand defamatory."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 65 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter065]Alan Dershowitz: October 2015About fifteen minutes into the ripped-from-the-headlines episode of Law & Order:SVU that was inspired by the Jeffrey Epstein saga, the plot takes an interestingturn: before officers have a chance to arrest him, Jordan, the character modeledon Epstein, shows up at SVU headquarters.The twelve-year-old French girl raped him, Jordan says.Wearing a monogrammed fleece pullover like the ones favored by Jeffrey Epstein,he describes an evening at home.“The party was in full swing,” he explains. “A friend said she wanted to give mea special present. Told me to wait in my massage room—”An SVU guy interrupts: “Guy has a massage room?”“I suffer from chronic back pain,” Jordan says.“While I was waiting, I fell asleep. Now, at first I thought I must be dreaming.I was aroused. I felt myself being manually manipulated. Then I remembered itwas my present. I started to enjoy myself. But then it got rough, and that’swhen I opened my eyes.”“What did you see?”“A woman. A woman I’d never seen before.”“A woman? Dominique Moreau was twelve!”“It was dark. I just wanted her off of me. I tried to stop her.”“But the twelve-year-old overpowered you?”“No. She threatened me. She said if I didn’t let her…continue, she was going toscream ‘Rape.’”“And there was nothing that you could do? You’ve got forty years and a hundredpounds on the girl.”“The party was going on right outside the door. I knew how this was going tolook. I was naked. She was naked. What could I do?”It was a brilliant plot twist—one that ultimately allowed Jordan to get offscot-free.But the plot twist that Epstein’s own story ended up taking on the day of AlanDershowitz’s deposition at a Broward County, Florida, courthouse was even moresurprising.“There was a criminal extortion plot,” Alan Dershowitz told Brad Edwards andPaul Cassell’s lawyer, Jack Scarola, on October 15, 2015.“Your clients were involved.”Bradley and Cassell had sued Dershowitz in Broward County for defamation—paybackfor extremely negative comments the law professor had made in the media.Dershowitz had countersued. His reputation was on the line, and he had comearmed for battle.“I’m thrilled they sued me,” he’d told reporters. “In the end, someone will bedisbarred. Either it will be me or the two lawyers.”But if Dershowitz was swinging for the fences in his struggle to keep hishard-earned reputation afloat, he still had a bombshell to drop. When deposed byScarola, he proposed his own theory about why Virginia Roberts had named him,along with Prince Andrew, as one of the men who had sexually abused her atEpstein’s New Mexico ranch, in New York City, and in Palm Beach.A theory that implicated the lawyers who were suing him in a much largerconspiracy.According to Dershowitz, Brad Edwards pressured Virginia Roberts intoidentifying Dershowitz as one her assailants.Dershowitz said that Edwards did this so that they could blackmail JeffreyEpstein’s patron Leslie Wexner for one billion dollars.Roberts lied about him, Dershowitz maintained, to give Wexner an idea of whatwould happen to him if Edwards’s demands weren’t met.Furthermore, Dershowitz said, he had proof."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 66 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter066]Excerpts from the Deposition of Alan Dershowitz: October 15, 20159:46 a.m.Q:In an interview with Hala Gorani on January 5 of this year, broadcast on CNNLive, you said, “I have a superb memory.” Do you acknowledge having made thatstatement?A:I have a superb memory, so I must have made that statement. My mother had anextraordinary memory, and when I was in college and I was on the debate team, mymother allowed me to debate on the Sabbath, which was Jewish rest day, only onthe condition that I not take notes or write. And at that point I discoveredthat I have a very good memory and don’t have to—generally didn’t have to takenotes. My memory, obviously, at the age of seventy-seven has slipped a bit; butdo I have a very good memory, yes.10:18 a.m.Q:Which of my clients are you swearing under oath encouraged Virginia Roberts toinclude allegations of an encounter with you at the New Mexico ranch?A:Both of them—both of your clients, both Judge Cassell and Mr. Edwards—wereboth involved in encouraging [their] client to file a perjurious affidavit thatthey knew or should have known was perjurious recently when they sought to fileanother defamatory allegation in the federal proceeding.Q:Was the arrangement such that what you are charging Bradley Edwards andProfessor Paul Cassell with doing was suborning perjury?A:Absolutely.

They would not give metheir names. But they told me [the] story. We had a series of phoneconversations in which I asked them, please, to tell me their names. And after aperiod of time, after they told me the story in great detail, she was willing togive me her name. She asked me to promise that I would not disclose her identitywithout her permission. I have been trying to call her. Called her as recentlyas this morning and last night.I want to recall—I don’t think I called her this morning.

Different last name from hers, but again.Q:Where do they live?A:Palm Beach. Or West Palm Beach, in the Palm Beach area. They have been friendsof Virginia Roberts since she was a young child.Q:Were there any witnesses to any of these phone conversations other thanRebecca, Michael, and you?A:Yes.Q:Who?A:My wife.Q:When did the first conversation occur?A:I can probably get you specific information about that. But it was months ago.When the story was in the newspapers, she called and related the entire story tome and related to me that it was part of a massive extortion plot.10:25 a.m.Q:Did you take contemporaneous notes of those phone conversations?A:No. I took note of names, but not really notes of the substance, no.Q:Have you ever made notes with regard to the substance of any communicationsthat you allegedly had with Rebecca and/or Michael?A:I didn’t “allegedly” have these conversations. I had these conversations. AndI don’t recall taking notes of those conversations.10:44 a.m.Q:How many phone calls did you have with this person Rebecca before she informedyou as to the reason why she was calling you?A:She informed me the first time.Q:The very first conversation.A:Yes.Q:How many phone calls was it before she asked you for money?A:She never asked me for money.Q:How many phone calls was it before her husband asked you for money?A:I was never asked for money, ever.Q:Do you know how it is that these people knew how to contact you?A:They told me they went to my website and got my number and left a message forme to call. Yeah, that’s what happened. Oh, no; they sent me—they went on mywebsite and sent me an e-mail and asked me—and the e-mail had a blank name but away to respond. And so I responded with my phone number and they called, is myrecollection. That’s my best recollection.10:45 a.m.Q:So from the very first conversation that you had with this person, you hadinformation indicating that this person was informing you that Bradley Edwardshad engaged in unethical conduct, correct?A:Let me just be very clear what she said to me. She said to me that she hadbeen told directly by her friend Virginia Roberts, who stayed with her overnightfor a period of time, that she never wanted to mention me in any of thepleadings. And that her two lawyers in the pleadings, or her lawyers who filedthe pleadings, pressured her into including my name and details.Q:Did Rebecca ever suggest to you that the details sworn to by Virginia Robertswere false?A:She certainly suggested that, yes. She mentioned to me that Virginia Robertshad never, ever mentioned [me to her], among any of the people that she had hadany contact with, until she—until she was pressured into doing so by herlawyers, yes.Q:So from the very first conversation, the impression you had was that this wasa witness who could provide information that Bradley Edwards and Paul Cassellhad acted unethically and dishonestly, correct?A:I wasn’t sure she could provide the information because she was very reluctantto come forward. She didn’t want to be involved. But I knew she had provided mewith information, yes, but I didn’t know, and I still don’t know, whether she isprepared to be a witness. I don’t know the answer to that question.11:08 a.m.Q:Was any request made by you for a meeting?A:Yes.Q:Let me back up then, if I could, please. Because what I want you to do, basedupon your superb memory, is to tell us in as much detail as you possibly canrecall everything that was said….A:I’m not sure the request for the meeting came in the first call or the secondcall….The first call was basically, I’d really like to talk to your wife[Rebecca] about this. I’m happy to fly down. I’m happy to talk to you on thephone. And we left it that they would think—that she would—that he would ask herto think about it. And that I could call back in a—in a few days and find outwhat her—what her current feelings were.Q:Where were you when you received this phone call—or when you made this phonecall? Sorry.A:I think I was in New York.Q:Do you know whether that phone call was made on a cell phone or a landline?A:I don’t remember.Q:Have you attempted to gather your telephone records for purposes of respondingto discovery requests in this case?A:I left that to my lawyers. I know that we did produce telephone records duringthe relevant periods of time when Virginia Roberts knew Jeffrey Epstein, andthose telephone records established that I could not have been at the locationsand at the times that Virginia Roberts claimed to have had—falsely claimed tohave [had] sexual contact with me.Q:I promise you we’re going to get to those.A:Good.Q:Promise you. Along with all the flight logs that you claim exonerate you.11:11 a.m.Q:Let’s go to the very second contact that you had with either Michael orRebecca. Who initiated the second contact?A:I think I did. I called and got Michael on the phone.Q:Where did you call from?A:I think New York.Q:Tell me in as much detail as your superb memory allows you to recalleverything that was said during the course of that phone conversation.[Dershowitz’s lawyer]: Let’s object to the form and the continued use of theword superb. He’s described his memory. That’s your characterization. Go ahead.Q:No, I think that that was Mr. Dershowitz’s characterization, which I haveadopted.[Lawyer]: Okay. Go ahead.A:I called, spoke to Michael. I asked Michael if he had spoken to his wife. Shesaid yes, and she was still reluctant to talk to me.Q:I’m sorry—she said yes when you asked Michael if he had spoken to his wife?A:He said yes. And that she was still reluctant to talk to me. I suggested tohim that perhaps she could talk to me briefly just so that she hears what I haveto say. And he could listen and remain on the phone, and she could stop at anytime she wanted. And there came a time during that conversation when she did geton the phone, and here’s what she told me. She said she had grown up withVirginia Roberts. That they were very, very close friends as young people. ThatVirginia Roberts came to stay with her for a number of days, I think it was overHalloween, and they had gone out and had dinner, just the two of them. And thatshe confided in her; Virginia Roberts confided in Rebecca that she had neverwanted to mention me in any of the pleadings, but she was pressured by herlawyer into doing so. Rebecca then said that I was not the object of thiseffort. The object of the effort was a billionaire who lives in Columbus, Ohio,and who owns Victoria’s Secret and Limited Too. Rebecca told me she did not knowthe name of that billionaire, but that Virginia and her lawyers hoped to get onebillion dollars, b-i-l-l-i-o-n, one billion dollars, or half of his net worth,from him by alleging that he had improperly engaged in sexual misconduct withVirginia Roberts. That money would be divided three ways: a third of it toVirginia Roberts, a third of it to a charity that she and her lawyers weresetting up for battered women, and a third of it to the lawyers.She then told me that they were trying to get ABC News to interview VirginiaRoberts so as to give her credibility in order to pressure the billionaire fromColumbus, Ohio, into paying a large sum of money. And that I was named as aneffort to try to show the billionaire what could happen to somebody if they wereaccused of sexual misconduct. And that would encourage him to settle a lawsuitor pay money in exchange for his name not being mentioned or revealed. I had noidea about this. And I didn’t—I didn’t ask about this. She just stated this. AndI then corroborated the fact that she was absolutely correct in everything shehad said to me.Q:You corroborated the fact that she was absolutely correct in everything thatshe had said to you?A:That’s right.Q:How?A:Okay. Let me answer that question. I was very—I wasn’t sure, so I calledLeslie Wexner. I got his wife on the phone, Abigail Wexner. Obviously I knewthat the only billionaire in Columbus, Ohio, who owned Limited Too and who ownedVictoria’s Secret was Leslie Wexner. I had met Leslie Wexner on two occasions, Ithink, and his wife. I called Abigail on the phone and I said, “I think youought to know that there is an extortion plot being directed against yourhusband by unscrupulous lawyers in—in Florida.” And she said, “Oh, we’re awareof that; they’ve already been in contact with us,” which surprised me. But [herstatement] was confirmation of that. I then also—I can’t give you the chronologyof that. I then was in touch with ABC and found out she was absolutely correctabout her efforts to try to get interviewed on ABC television. In fact, Ilearned that your client, Brad Edwards, had sent a communication to people inthe area urging them to watch her interview that was scheduled to be on threetelevision programs. If I’m not mistaken, it was [the] Good Day Show, theevening news, and the show Nightline….I then was in communication with ABC andhelped to persuade them that they would be putting false information on the airif they allowed Virginia Roberts to tell her false story. So I was able tocorroborate that. I then also corroborated the fact that she had never mentionedme when her boyfriend appeared on television and publicly stated that she hadnever mentioned me in any of her description[s] of people who she had sexualcontact with. So I was then completely satisfied that Rebecca was telling me thecomplete truth. And that in my view, there was an extortion plot directedagainst Leslie Wexner, a criminal extortion plot directed against Leslie Wexner,and that your clients were involved in that extortion plot.11:30 a.m.Q:Let’s see if we can make sure that we’re understanding one another, sir. Doyou recognize that there’s a distinction between Virginia Roberts having metyou, having been sexually abused by you on multiple occasions, but not wantingto name you as opposed to Virginia Roberts never having met you and never havingbeen sexually abused by you…? Are those two things different in your mind?A:Not in the context of this case. Because Virginia Roberts said that she wasgoing to seek justice from everybody that had abused her. And if she didn’t wantto name me, I think the inference is inescapable that I was not among thosepeople that she had had any sexual contact with. So that was certainly theinference I drew….11:35 a.m.Q:Who are the people that Rebecca says Virginia had previously told her thatVirginia was abused by?A:I never asked her that question.Q:Did you ask her was Les Wexner one of the people that abused Virginia?A:I told you I never asked her the question.Q:Are you aware that years before December of 2014, when the CVRA pleading wasfiled, that your name had come up repeatedly in connection with JeffreyEpstein’s abuse of minors, correct?A:I am aware that never before 2014, end of December, was it ever, ever allegedthat I had acted in any way inappropriately with regard to Virginia Roberts,that I ever touched her, that I ever met her, that I had ever been with her. Iwas completely aware of that. There had never been any allegation. She claimsunder oath that she told you that secretly in 2011, but you have produced nonotes of any such conversation. You, of course, are a witness to this allegationand will be deposed as a witness to this allegation. I believe it is an entirelyfalse allegation that she told you in 2011 that she had had any sexual contactwith me. I think she’s lying through her teeth when she says that. And I doubtthat your notes will reveal any such information. But if she did tell you that,she would be absolutely, categorically lying. So I am completely aware thatnever—until the lies were put in a legal pleading at the end of December 2014,it was never alleged that I had any sexual contact with Virginia Roberts. I knowthat it was alleged that I was a witness to Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged abuse, andthat was false. I was never a witness to any of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.And I wrote that to you, something that you have falsely denied. And I stand onthe record. The record is clear that I have categorically denied I was ever awitness to any abuse, that I ever saw Jeffrey Epstein abusing anybody. And—andthe very idea that I would stand and talk to Jeffrey Epstein while he wasreceiving oral sex from Virginia Roberts, which she swore to under oath, is sooutrageous, so preposterous, that even David Boies [a prominent lawyerassociated with the firm representing Virginia Roberts] said he couldn’t believeit was true.12:24 p.m.Q:You engaged in a mass-media campaign to convince the world that BradleyEdwards and Professor Paul Cassell were unethical lawyers who had fabricatedfalse charges against you, correct?A:No, that’s not correct. I responded to press inquiries by telling the truth.My goal was to let the world know that Virginia Roberts’s allegations against mewere totally false. These two stories appeared, as far as I can tell, in everysingle newspaper in the world and on every media, which was part of their plotand the plan of your clients, which is why they absurdly mentioned PrinceAndrew, claiming in the most absurd way—that they mentioned him because he wastrying to lobby prosecutors to get a reduced sentence for Jeffrey Epstein; theyobviously put Prince Andrew in there in order to get massive publicity aroundthe world. And every media in the world, practically, called me, from the BBC toCBS to ABC to CNN, and I responded to lies with the truth.Q:And the truth that you attempted to convey was that Bradley Edwards andProfessor Paul Cassell were unethical lawyers who fabricated false chargesagainst you, right?A:The truth that I intended to convey was that the charges against me were falseand fabricated, that I never had any sexual contact—Q:Fabricated by whom, sir?A:Please don’t interrupt me….that I never had any sexual contact with VirginiaRoberts. Because Professor Cassell insisted on conveying to the public that hewas a former judge and that he was a professor and that he was using—improperly,in my view—the stationery and name of his university to add credibility to hisclaims, I felt that it was imperative for me to indicate that he was engaging inimproper and unethical conduct. It would have been improper for me to haveallowed his use of his credibility as a former federal judge, as a professor whouses, misuses, his university imprimatur—it was very important for me to attackthe credibility of the messengers of the false information. And it was importantfor me to also remind the public that Bradley Edwards was a partner of [Scott]Rothstein, a man who is spending fifty years in jail for fraudulently creating aPonzi scheme to sell Jeffrey Epstein cases that didn’t exist."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 67 [part0123.xhtml#toc-chapter067]Scott Rothstein: 2009Scott Rothstein was a flashy Fort Lauderdale ex-lawyer who parked his collectionof cars in an air-conditioned warehouse, kept a copy of the Torah on his desk,and hung a portrait of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone outside his office. One ofhis nicknames was TPOFD, short for “the Prince of Fucking Darkness,” and inprivate, he’d say things like: “Understand that the repercussions of engaging mecould open the gates of hell. Understand that I am capable of evil far beyondanything your imagination could ever conjure up.”Rothstein hosted receptions for prominent politicians—John McCain, Bobby Jindal,Arnold Schwarzenegger—and handed out hundreds of thousands of dollars at a timein campaign contributions. He gave millions more to charitable institutions: theJoe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital; the American Heart Association. By all outwardappearances, he could afford it: seventy lawyers worked in his firm, which hadoffices in Florida, New York, and Venezuela. But Rothstein’s millions actuallycame from a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme he’d been running since 2005.In April of 2009, Bradley Edwards joined Rothstein’s firm. The lawyer broughthis papers along, and Rothstein showed those pertaining to Epstein to potentialinvestors. In exchange for a lump sum up front, Rothstein said, investors wouldreceive a far larger chunk of money later, which Epstein would pay in futuresettlements.Edwards and Rothstein both say that Edwards had no knowledge whatsoever of thePonzi scheme. (Prosecutors, and the Florida Bar, agree.) Edwards left as soon ashe caught wind of the scheme, in November of 2009. But the few months he spentin Rothstein’s company gave Dershowitz the opening he needed to pry openVirginia Roberts’s accusations.It was at Edwards’s insistence, Dershowitz would say, as well as Paul Cassell’s,that Virginia Roberts added Dershowitz’s name to the list of men she claimed hadabused her.According to Dershowitz, he’d been pulled into a billion-dollar extortion plotEdwards had hatched. And for Edwards and Cassell, there had been a secondarybenefit: Dershowitz had helped to work out Epstein’s confidentialnon-prosecution agreement with the government. By implicating him directly inEpstein’s abuse of underage women, Dershowitz claimed, Edwards and Cassell weretrying to “open up” that agreement.It might have been a Hail Mary pass on the part of Alan Dershowitz.But the argument had its own internal logic.The idea that Bradley Edwards and Paul Cassell were trying to blackmail LeslieWexner—blackmail him for one billion dollars, no less—sounds highly improbable.But we do know for a fact that Edwards had worked with Rothstein—a man who’dbeen running his own billion-dollar con.Edwards may not have known that Rothstein was taking his files on JeffreyEpstein and showing them to investors. But Edwards’s proximity to Rothsteindidn’t look good. It may not have been as damaging as Dershowitz’s closefriendship with Epstein, but it was damaging nonetheless. It gave Dershowitz theopening he needed to make his argument. And the genius of Dershowitz’s argumentwas that it wasn’t necessarily predicated on an actual plot to blackmail Wexner.Maybe the thing Edwards was really after was the idea that a lawyer who helpedwork out Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement was also having sex with VirginiaRoberts. That would give Edwards leverage in trying to crack the agreement open.And in that case, was it so hard to imagine him pressuring Virginia Roberts toadd Dershowitz’s name to the list?Perhaps it wasn’t, in this scenario. Virginia would have still felt reluctant tomention Dershowitz. If she was, there was the matter of the three hundredmillion dollars, and then some, that she would stand to gain. And the threehundred million or so that goes to set up a charity for battered women? If thescenario Dershowitz had thrown out was true, that would have been a genius moveon Edwards’s part—the sort of detail that helps the whole psychological picturefall into place. If Virginia felt guilty for lying about Dershowitz, she couldthink of the thousands of battered women she’d end up helping.All these possibilities seemed bizarre. And yet everything connected withEpstein’s story seemed to be bizarre.Bill Clinton got the use of a jet out of Epstein—a trip to Africa. But he andEpstein weren’t bosom buddies.As for Prince Andrew, we already know how he feels about women.But what did Dershowitz get out of Epstein, aside from Epstein’s wise counsel onall the books he’d written?One advantage Dershowitz had, as he laid out his argument, was that when it cameto Jeffrey Epstein, all bets were off. He didn’t have to establish hisinnocence. All he had to do was make sure that the waters stayed muddy. The morecomplicated things seemed to be, the better they were for Dershowitz.Thanks to Jeffrey Epstein’s actions, and the endlessly complicated cycle ofsuits and countersuits those actions inspired, those waters were very muddyindeed."},{"pageContent":"CODA [part0123.xhtml#toc-appendix001]SCOTT ROTHSTEINOn October 27, 2009, Florida’s governor, Charlie Crist, left Scott Rothstein avoice-mail message.“Hey, Scott,” the governor said. “It’s Charlie, your favorite Greek governor.Hope you’re doing well, buddy. Just wanted to touch base and let you know I’mworking Versace for November twenty-fourth, and it is going amazinglywell—unbelievable, brother….Really enjoyed again seeing you and Kimmie andwatch[ing] a little football and best to you guys from Carol and me. We loveyou. Take care. Bye-bye.”That same day, Rothstein took a chartered Gulfstream V to Casablanca, Morocco.For a while, it seemed as if Rothstein was running. But a few days later, thesame Gulfstream returned to Fort Lauderdale. The Ponzi king had decided to turnhimself in.The moment he did, he started to sing like a canary in return for a lenientsentence. Rothstein gave up dozens of associates—the list included people at hislaw firm, law enforcement officers, and his own wife, Kimmie, who was arrestedfor hiding more than one million dollars’ worth of jewelry.All in all, more than thirty people involved in Rothstein’s schemes werearrested and sentenced.Thanks, in part, to his cooperation with the feds, his was the only Ponzi schemein history in which all the victims recovered their money. In return, Rothsteinwas put into a witness protection program and is serving his fifty-year sentenceanonymously, in an undisclosed prison location.ALAN DERSHOWITZOn November 10, 2015, Alan Dershowitz arrived at Shriver Hall, on the campus ofJohns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, to talk about the Arab-Israeli conflict.“The outlines for peace are so obvious,” he said. “There has to be a two-statesolution.”Fifteen minutes into the talk, a group of women—students belonging to a groupcalled Hopkins Feminists—stood up in protest. Dressed all in black, with ducttape over their mouths, they held up a sign and marched out of the hall.YOU ARE RAPE CULTURE, the sign read.Afterward, a reporter for the student paper asked Dershowitz about JeffreyEpstein and Epstein’s victims. Wasn’t it true that Dershowitz had implied thatone of those victims was “asking for it?”“I’m a defense attorney,” Dershowitz replied. “I have an obligation under theConstitution to provide a full and zealous defense to my clients. If I havefailed to do all the things you had just listed, I could be disbarred. I couldbe found incompetent as counsel.”He asked the reporter, “Would any defense lawyer not look on the websites, lookon social networks, find out what the woman who was accusing my client wasdoing? We were able to disprove many of the charges, just like how I was able todisprove the charges against me. Falsely charging somebody with rape is aheinous thing to do. First of all, it creates horrors for the person who hasbeen falsely accused. Second, it so hurts real rape victims because it makes itclear that some women lie for money. Our country, unlike others, requires thateverybody be defended, and I’m going to continue to do that whether my clientsare guilty or innocent. Let me tell you, most of my clients have been guilty.They deserve a zealous defense just as anybody else. I’m very proud of what Idid for Jeffrey Epstein. If people don’t like the fact that I got a ‘good deal,’that’s the job I do.”The suits and countersuits Paul Cassell, Bradley Edwards, and Dershowitz filedagainst each other dragged on into the spring of 2016—reaching a crescendo withDershowitz’s argument about the plot to blackmail Les Wexner. But on April 8,all the parties involved agreed to settle, issuing a joint statement that read:“Edwards and Cassell acknowledge that it was a mistake to have filed sexualmisconduct accusations against Dershowitz; and the sexual misconduct accusationsmade in all public filings (including all exhibits) are hereby withdrawn.Dershowitz also withdraws his accusations that Edwards and Cassell actedunethically. Neither Edwards, Cassell, nor Dershowitz have any intention ofrepeating the allegations against one another.” Dershowitz also hired former FBIdirector Louis J. Freeh to do an independent investigation. Freeh concluded thatthe evidence his team reviewed refuted the accusations of sexual misconductagainst Dershowitz.For Alan Dershowitz, the long nightmare he’d had to endure as a result of hisfriendship with Jeffrey Epstein finally seemed to be over.GHISLAINE MAXWELLTrying to put her troubles with Epstein behind her, Ghislaine Maxwell took up anew calling.“She’s doing something to save the oceans now,” a socialite says over the din ofcocktail-party chatter at a private Palm Beach Club.Maxwell’s nonprofit, the TerraMar Project, describes itself as “a platform forcitizenship and transformation of the high seas.” Its focus is on cleaning upthe eight million metric tons of plastic debris—garbage—that are dumped into theworld’s oceans each year. (Sources say that an earlier enterprise, the SeedMedia Group, was funded by Jeffrey Epstein in 2005 to the tune of two milliondollars.)“Is anybody here staying awake at night because they’re frightened about theocean?” she asks in 2014 at a TEDx talk in Charlottesville, Virginia. “Are youscared about what could happen? Are you trying to think about what could you dothat would help the ocean and all its myriad of troubles?”But although her efforts on behalf of the environment are sincere andarticulate, Ghislaine still appears in the society pages.In 2010, she attends Chelsea Clinton’s wedding in Rhinebeck, New York.In 2014, New York journalist Richard Johnson reports that she’s newly back fromrunning in an Iditarod dogsled race in Alaska. “It’s hard to top GhislaineMaxwell in the globe-trotting department,” he writes.Upon her return, the president of the China Arts Foundation International hostsMaxwell at a dinner cooked by the former chef for Madame Chiang Kai-shek.Sources say that Maxwell still maintains her warm relationship with theClintons. She was never charged with a crime. And Maxwell has repeatedly deniedall allegations made by Virginia Roberts—and continues to do so today. Throughher lawyer, Maxwell says she’s had no connection to any criminal misconductinvolving Virginia Roberts (or any other young woman) and Jeffrey Epstein. Sheclaims that Virginia’s story about her experience as a “sex slave” has changed,significantly, over time—that with each telling, Virginia adds salacious detailsand names new public figures. Nevertheless, legal troubles for Maxwell recentlybegan.In 2015, Virginia Roberts filed a defamation suit against the woman she saysrecruited her to work at Epstein’s house on El Brillo Way. In January of 2016,Roberts filed additional papers, claiming that a defamation suit filed againstBill Cosby, another alleged sexual predator, was directly relevant to her caseagainst Maxwell. In March, Maxwell filed an answer in court denying all ofRoberts’s allegations and accusing Roberts of fabricating them for financialgain.As of this writing, the suit is ongoing.PRINCE ANDREWIn January of 2016, Sunninghill Park—the twelve-bedroom estate that SarahFerguson and Prince Andrew once shared in the English county of Berkshire—wasbulldozed.Prince Andrew had long since sold the home, which he and Sarah had received as agift after their 1986 wedding. He got into hot water when it was revealed thatthe buyer, a Kazakh billionaire named Timur Kulibayev, had paid three millionpounds more than the home’s asking price.For her part, Sarah Ferguson announced that she was moving into athirteen-million-pound ski chalet in Switzerland.It was a fitting end to the long, sometimes sordid story of the prince’smarriage. But it was not the end of the scandals that seemed always to beswirling around the prince.On January 2, 2015, Virginia Roberts’s allegations about her relationship withthe prince—and the photo of him with his arm around Roberts’s waist—appeared inthe press. Prince Andrew was forced to cut short a skiing holiday to confer withhis mother, the queen, and to issue a statement denying Roberts’s allegations—astep that was widely seen as being without precedent for a member of the royalfamily.That same month, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the princewas again forced to “reiterate and to reaffirm” the repeated denials made byBuckingham Palace that he had any sort of sexual relationship with Roberts, whohad announced in papers filed at the start of the year that Prince Andrew has a“sexual interest in feet.”“My focus is on my work,” Prince Andrew said at the time.Asked by a reporter, “Will you be making a statement?” the prince refused toanswer.A few days later, Virginia Roberts signed a sworn statement in which she said,“I did have sexual contact with him as I have described here—under oath. Givenwhat he knows and has seen, I was hoping that he would simply voluntarily tellthe truth about everything. I hope my attorneys can interview Prince Andrewunder oath about the contacts and that he will tell the truth.”According to several reports, Roberts’s lawyers had written to the prince,asking him to respond to her allegations in court. Reportedly, Buckingham Palacerefused delivery of the letter.“I knew he was a member of the British royal family, but I just called him‘Andy,’” Roberts had said in her statement. “I got news from Maxwell that Iwould be meeting a prince. Later that day, Epstein told me I was meeting a‘major prince.’ Epstein told me ‘to exceed’ everything I had been taught. Heemphasized that whatever Prince Andrew wanted, I was to make sure he got.”Signing her name to the document, Roberts wrote, “I declare under penalty ofperjury that the foregoing is true and correct.”That spring, Prince Andrew got a rare break: a federal judge in South Floridaordered that the allegations Roberts made be stricken from civil-court records.“At this juncture in the proceedings, these lurid details are unnecessary,” thejudge concluded. Once again, Buckingham Palace vehemently denied the prince’sinvolvement in any activities, sexual or otherwise, pertaining to Roberts. Butthat same year, reports leaked that the BBC program Panorama was working on anin-depth investigation into the prince’s dealings with Epstein and Roberts.As of this writing, the investigation has yet to air.BARRY KRISCHER“I have no intention of being dragged into that conversation,” Barry Krischersaid in 2016 when contacted via telephone and asked about Jeffrey Epstein.More than a decade had passed since Epstein’s case first landed on the stateattorney’s desk.“The New York Times has called me,” said Krischer. “The British papers. I’m notinterested in being pulled into that conversation. I know that the police chiefdidn’t think the case was handled right, but that’s why he’s a cop and I’m aprosecutor.”Krischer, who left the state attorney’s office in 2009, is still a member of theCriminal Justice Commission in Palm Beach County. Since his retirement, he’svolunteered one morning a week at the office of the state attorney and twomornings a week at the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.He still remains active in child welfare issues, working with the FloridaDepartment of Children and Families.Despite his continued involvement with local law enforcement, he hasn’t spokento Michael Reiter in years.BRADLEY EDWARDSIn December of 2009, Jeffrey Epstein filed suit, under Florida’s RICO act,against Scott Rothstein, the jailed Ponzi king; Bradley Edwards, the lawyerwho’d worked, briefly, in Rothstein’s law firm, RRA, and represented several ofEpstein’s victims; and one of those victims, an individual referred to in thelawsuit as “L.M.”“Upon information and belief,” the suit stated, “EDWARDS knew or should haveknown that ROTHSTEIN was utilizing RRA as a front for the massive Ponzi schemeand/or were selling an alleged interest or investment in the Civil Actions (andother claims) involving Epstein.” The suit also claimed that, “By using CivilActions against EPSTEIN as ‘bait’ and fabricating settlements regarding same,ROTHSTEIN and others were able to lure investors into ROTHSTEIN’S lair andbilked them of millions of dollars which, in turn, was used to fund thelitigation against EPSTEIN for the sole purpose of continuing the massive Ponzischeme.”Moreover, the suit claimed, L.M. had “testified she never had sex with Epstein;worked at numerous strip clubs; is an admitted prostitute and call girl; has ahistory of illegal drug use (pot, painkillers, Xanax, Ecstasy); and continuallyasserted the 5th Amendment during her depositions in order to avoid answeringrelevant but problem questions for her.” (The suit made similar claims about twoother victims.) According to the suit, L.M. had said only good things aboutEpstein when interviewed by the FBI in 2007, while being represented by anotherlawyer. Her story “changed dramatically,” the suit claimed, once she was “in thehands of EDWARDS and RRA.”In a motion for summary judgment filed by Bradley Edwards, Edwards denied all ofthese allegations, calling Epstein’s claims frivolous for two separate reasons:On the one hand, Edwards claimed, Epstein was seeking damages from Edwards whileasserting his own Fifth Amendment privilege to block the discovery of relevantfacts. (And, in fact, Epstein did plead the Fifth, dozens of times, when deposedby the lawyers of his victims.) On the other hand, Epstein’s claims were“directly contradicted by all of the record evidence.“The truth in the record is entirely devoid of any evidence to support Epstein’sclaims and is completely and consistently corroborative of Edwards’s swornassertion of innocence,” the motion stated.Put simply, Epstein has made allegations that have no basis in fact. To thecontrary, his lawsuit was merely a desperate measure by a serial pedophile toprevent being held accountable for repeatedly sexually abusing minor females.Epstein’s ulterior motives in filing and prosecuting this lawsuit are blatantlyobvious. Epstein’s behavior is another clear demonstration that he feels helives above the law and that because of his wealth he can manipulate the systemand pay for lawyers to do his dirty work—even to the extent of having themassert baseless claims against other members of the Florida Bar. Epstein’sComplaint against Edwards and LM is nothing short of a far-fetched fictionalfairy-tale with absolutely no evidence whatsoever to support his preposterousclaims. It was his last ditch effort to escape the public disclosure by Edwardsand his clients of the nature, extent, and sordid details of his life as aserial child molester. Edwards’s Motion for Summary Judgment should be grantedwithout equivocation.Edwards filed a counterclaim for malicious prosecution. “He sued me withknowingly made up, falsified facts,’ Edwards says.And his sole motivation was to extort me into abandoning the legitimate cases Iwas pursuing against him on behalf of the victims, including the CVRA suit. Heultimately had to dismiss that case, literally on the morning our SummaryJudgment was to be heard. I then sued him. We were set for trial. The judgegranted me punitive damages in my claim. And then, in a separate case inFlorida, one of the appellate courts basically abolished the tort of maliciousprosecution in Florida. My case was dismissed. I then appealed that. And ourdistrict ruled that my malicious prosecution claim can stand and the tort is notabolished in Florida. They sent it back to the trial court and Jeffrey Epsteinappealed that to the State Supreme Court, and that’s where that stands.SARAH KELLEN“She said her name was Clara something on the rental application,” says a realestate agent in Palm Beach. “It wasn’t until much later that I realized she wasassociated with Epstein.”In April of 2009, that agent rented Clara a bungalow in Palm Beach. For Clara,that little home was a step down from Jeffrey Epstein’s big house on El BrilloWay and from the life she’d known as Sarah Kellen. But not such a step down.“She signed a lease to pay four thousand dollars a month from April 18 throughJuly 18, 2009,” says a Palm Beach resident familiar with the local housingmarket. “But she stayed a lot longer. And by the way, she went on around-the-world trip for at least a month while she had the lease.”Kellen had been a prime suspect in Chief Reiter’s investigation. Prosecutors hadconsidered charging her, Wendy Dobbs, and Nadia Marcinkova as potentialcoconspirators. They’d avoided those charges as part of the plea deal thatEpstein had struck—a deal in the course of which it was suggested that ifEpstein had to have pleaded to something, he could have pleaded to strikingKellen—or slapping her, once, on his jet. Assault, they’d have called it.Kellen might have gone along with that. But in the end she didn’t need to.Sources say she found another rich man as Epstein whiled away his hours in andout of the Palm Beach Stockade. She reinvented herself, and when herrelationship with the wealthy man fell apart, she played the field until she metand married a race-car driver named Brian Vickers. Along the way she reinventedherself yet again, changing her name to Sarah Kensington.NADIA MARCINKOVANadia Marcinkova changed her surname to Marcinko and, after training at a PalmBeach flight school, became a commercial pilot and certified flight instructor.Calling herself Gulfstream Girl on Facebook, she cultivated her social mediapresence until 2013, when the Gulfstream company filed a trademark infringementlawsuit against her. When the suit was settled out of court, in 2014, Marcinkochanged “Gulfstream” to “Global.”“As a child,” she wrote for the “About Me” page on her website, “Nadia channeledher entrepreneurial spirit by selling invisible pets to neighboring kids. Shecontinued on to manage a successful family marketing business and soon she wasdiscovered by a modeling agency and immersed into the marketing and advertisingworld as a spokesperson and international fashion model.”There is no mention of Jeffrey Epstein. But on her YouTube channel, Marcinkoappears in the cockpit of a Gulfstream II that looks very much like Epstein’sGulfstream, sitting beside a man who looks much like Larry Visoski, a pilot forEpstein.Marcinko’s Manhattan address belongs to a building where Jeffrey Epstein’sbrother, Mark, owns the majority of apartments.Sarah Kensington uses the same address in New York.THE GIRLSOne of the girls who gave Jeffrey Epstein massages moved to Los Angeles andbecame an actress, starring for a time in a soap opera and appearing in severalfilms. She is now pursuing a career in country music.Several girls have been arrested for drugs, prostitution, and other nonviolentcrimes.One girl is dead—murdered by her boyfriend for reasons that had nothing to dowith Epstein.One of the girls who claimed to have been raped by Epstein is now a successfulreal estate broker in South Florida.Mary moved back in with her parents, finished high school, and attended collegefor a while. She had her ups and downs along the way. In 2010, she was arrestedfor shoplifting. But Mary, who was born in 1990, is still in hermidtwenties—still young for a man of Jeffrey Epstein’s age—with many good yearsahead of her.Wendy Dobbs studied nursing in college and became a bartender and waitress. “Iwant to fill a position in which I can [utilize] my communication and customerservice skills to help others,” she wrote on LinkedIn. “I feel I am at my bestwhen I can make a difference in someone’s life. My goal is to inspire andencourage others to make positive changes daily. If you are not reaching for thestars then your dreams are not big enough.”THE COPSMichele Pagan is now a sergeant for the Palm Beach Police Department.In early 2012, at a reception at Mar-a-Lago, Detective Joe Recarey received thefirst Palm Beach Police Foundation Police Officer of the Year award—one ofseveral honors he received in the course of his twenty-three-year career in PalmBeach. Two years later, he left the department and took a job as director ofloss prevention for the Gold Coast Beverage company.“I’ve been [at the Palm Beach Police Department] longer than my children havebeen alive,” he told a reporter for the Palm Beach Daily News when he left. “I’mgoing to miss a majority of the people I’ve worked with, and, obviously, I’mgoing to miss the work. This is my extended family. Like many families, you havedisagreements with some family members. But you overlook that, and you worktogether and you’re a team. I’m going to look back and miss a lot of the peopleI’ve worked with.”Palm Beach police chief Michael Reiter left the department in 2008 aftertwenty-eight years on the job. He now runs his own security company in PalmBeach.JEAN-LUC BRUNELIn January of 2015, Jean-Luc Brunel sued his old friend Jeffrey Epstein,claiming that Epstein’s fall from grace had cost him millions of dollars inbusiness and caused him “severe emotional stress.”The lawsuit claimed, “Plaintiff Brunel is emotionally destroyed as a result ofEpstein’s actions and the resulting effects on his business. He has been onmedications to deal with the effects of this.”It continues: “Defendant Epstein recklessly inflicted emotional distress onPlaintiff Brunel by engaging in illegal conduct with under-aged girls, which wasfalsely linked to Plaintiff….This illegal conduct was extreme and outrageous byany standard.”The suit went on to quote Brunel’s doctor, who said that the modeling scout hadgone into psychotherapy “due to a subjective sense of depression related to whathe believes is a loss of business in his modeling agency as a result of slanderpublished against his business.” Brunel had gone on prescription drugs—Prozac,Rivotril—as a result.The fashion world had frozen him out, he said, after his relationship withJeffrey Epstein had become public. It had become impossible for him to find the“fresh faces” he needed for his agency, MC2.Brunel acknowledged Epstein’s alleged crimes but denied his own involvement.“Epstein’s illegal activities were outrageous and extreme; they involvedreceiving massages from the under-aged girls while the girls were nude or nearlynude; penetration of the girls with a finger or object; or full intercourse.”When the Daily Beast reported the story and reached out to Brunel for a comment,the website’s reporter was told, “Jean-Luc is not in town; he’s in SouthAmerica.”Brunel’s agency, MC2, is still in business.JEFFREY EPSTEINAs of this writing, Jeffrey Epstein continues to entertain young women at hisManhattan town house."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUE [part0123.xhtml#toc-epilouge]When John Connolly, Tim Malloy, and I began work on this book, I had hoped tointerview Jeffrey Epstein myself: to look directly into the eyes of the man we’dbe writing about. Epstein declined to sit for an interview. Many of his friendsand associates did speak with us on the condition that they not be quoted.Several of them still liked Epstein and made a point of telling us what a loyalfriend he was—although, like Icarus, he seemed to have a fatal flaw.If Epstein had agreed to an interview, these are the questions I would haveasked him:•You pleaded guilty to a single felony count of soliciting prostitution from aminor. Do you believe in your heart that you were guilty?•In 2011 you told the New York Post, “I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an‘offender.’ It’s the difference between a murderer and a person who steals abagel.” Do you stand by that statement today?•Do you feel you were treated fairly by the criminal justice system?•What effect did your conviction have on your business?•Do you believe that you’ve done psychological harm to the women—especially theunderage girls—you’ve been involved with?•Are you still in touch with Ghislaine Maxwell?•Are you in touch with Prince Andrew?•You’ve spent time with Bill Clinton as well as Donald Trump. How would youcharacterize the two men?•Several people have described you as a very loyal friend. Is that a faircharacterization?•I’ve heard that Leslie Wexner removed all photographs of you from his home.Given how close you once were, have you reconciled or tried to repair therelationship?•Did the thirteen months you spent in jail change you in any way?•After your stay in prison, have you continued to seek the company of veryunderage women?•You were ordered to undergo psychological treatment as part of your sentence.Are you under treatment today?•Do you regard yourself as having a sex addiction, and, if so, have you beentreated for it?•What is your greatest regret?•What do you look for in a woman?•Last question. How well do you sleep at night?

[../Images/image00215.jpeg]part0123.xhtml#toc-teaser001For an excerpt, turn the page."},{"pageContent":" He changed identity like many warriors do before battle. He called himselfMercury on nights like these.Dressed in black from his visor helmet to his steel-toe boots, Mercury had hismotorcycle backed up into a huge rhododendron bush by the Rock Creek Parkwaysouth of Calvert Street. He sat astride the idling bike and cradled a U.S. Armysurplus light detection and ranging device. He trained the lidar on everyvehicle that went past him, checking its speed.Forty-five miles an hour, on the money. Forty-four. Fifty-two. Routine stuff.Safe numbers. Boring numbers.Mercury was hoping to see a more exotic and inflated figure on the screen. Hehad good reason to believe a bloated number like that would appear before thisnight was over. He was certainly in the right place for it.Built in the 1920s, Rock Creek Parkway had been designed to preserve the naturalscenic beauty of the area. The winding four-lane road ran from the LincolnMemorial north through parks, gardens, and woods. It was 2.9 miles long andsplit in Northwest DC. Beach Drive, the right fork, headed northeast, deeperinto the park. The parkway itself continued on to the left and curled backnorthwest to the intersection with Calvert Street.Forty-three miles an hour, according to the lidar display. Forty-seven.Forty-five.These numbers were not surprising. The parkway was on the National Register ofHistoric Places and was maintained by the National Park Service; it had a setspeed limit of forty-five miles an hour.But the parkway’s meandering route was about as close to a Grand Prix circuit asyou could find in or around the District of Columbia. Elongated S curves,chicanes, a few altitude changes, straightaways that ran down the creekbottom—they were all there, and the road was almost twice the length of thefabled Grand Prix course at Watkins Glen, New York.That alone makes it a target, Mercury thought. That alone says someone will try.If not tonight, then tomorrow, or the night after.He’d read an article in the Washington Post that said that on any given night,the odds were better than one in three that some rich kid or an older pricksucking big-time off the federal teat would bring out the new Porsche or theoverhorsed BMW and take a crack at Rock Creek. So might the suburban kid who’dsnuck out the old man’s Audi, or even a middle-aged mom or two.All sorts of people seemed obsessed by it. One try every three nights, Mercurythought. But tonight, the odds were even better than average.A few days ago, a budget crisis had closed the U.S. government. All funding forpark law enforcement had been frozen. No salaries were being paid. Park rangershad been sent home for liability reasons. There was no one looking but him.Hours went by. Traffic slowed to a trickle, and still Mercury aimed the lidargun and shot, read the verdict, and waited. He was nodding off at a quarter tothree that morning and thinking that he should pack it in when he heard thegrowl of a big-bore engine turning onto the parkway from Beach Drive.On that sound alone, Mercury’s right hand shot out and fired up the bike. Hisleft hand aimed the lidar at the growl, which became a whining, buzzing wail offury coming right at him.The instant he had headlights, he hit the trigger.Seventy-two miles an hour.He tossed the lidar into the rhododendrons. He’d return for it later.The Maserati blew by him.Mercury twisted the accelerator and popped the clutch. He blasted out of therhododendrons, flew off the embankment, and landed with a smoking squeal in theparkway not a hundred yards behind the Italian sports car."},{"pageContent":" The Maserati was brand-new, sleek, black; a Quattroporte, Mercury thought,judging by the glimpse he had gotten of the car as it roared past him, andprobably an S Q5.Mercury studied such exotic vehicles. A Maserati Quattroporte S Q5 had aturbo-injected six-cylinder engine with a top speed of 176 miles per hour, andit boasted brilliant transmission, suspension, and steering systems.Overall, the Maserati was a worthy opponent, suited to the parkway’s challenges.The average man or woman might think a car like that would be impossible to beston such a demanding course, especially by a motorcycle.The average person would be wrong.Mercury’s bike was a flat-out runner of a beast that could hit 190 miles an hourand remain nimble through curves, corkscrews, and every other twist, turn, andterrain change a road might throw at you. Especially if you knew how to drive ahigh-speed motorcycle, and Mercury did. He had been driving fast bikes hisentire life and felt uniquely suited to bring this one up to speed.Eighty miles per hour; ninety. The Maserati’s brake lights flashed in front ofhim as the parkway came out of the big easterly curve. But the driver of theItalian sports car was not set up for the second turn of a lazy and backward S.Mercury pounced on the rookie mistake; he crouched low, gunned the bike, andcame into the second curve on a high line, smoking-fast and smooth. When heexited the second curve, he was right on the Maserati’s back bumper and goingseventy-plus.The parkway ran a fairly true course south for nearly a mile there, and theItalian sports car tried to out-accelerate Mercury on the straight. But theMaserati was no match for Mercury’s custom ride.He drafted right in behind the sports car, let go of the left handlebar, andgrabbed the Remington 1911 pistol Velcroed to the gas tank.Eighty-nine. Ninety.Ahead, the parkway took a hard, long left turn. The Maserati would have tobrake. Mercury decelerated, dropped back, and waited for it.The second the brake lights of the Italian sports car flashed, the motorcyclisthit the gas and made a lightning-quick jagging move that brought him right upnext to the Maserati’s passenger-side window. No passenger.Mercury got no more than a silhouette image of the driver before he fired at himtwice. The window shattered. The bullets hit hard.The Maserati swerved left, smacked the guardrail, and spun back toward theinside lane just as Mercury’s bike shot ahead and out of harm’s way. Hedownshifted and braked, getting ready for the coming left turn.In his side-view mirror, he watched the Maserati vault the rail, hit trees, andexplode into fire.Mercury felt no mercy or pity for the driver.The sonofabitch should have known that speed kills."},{"pageContent":" Leaving the gluten-free aisle at Whole Foods, Tom McGrath was thinking that thelong, lithe woman in the teal-colored leggings and matching warm-up jacket infront of him had the posture of a ballerina.In her early thirties, with high cheekbones, almond-shaped eyes, and jet-blackhair pulled back in a ponytail, she was lovely to look at, exotic even. Sheseemed to sense his interest and glanced back at him.In a light Eastern European accent, she said, “You walk like old fart, Tom.”“I feel like one, Edita,” said McGrath, who was in his mid-forties and built like a wide receiver gone slightly to seed. “I’m stiff andsore where I’ve never even thought of being stiff and sore.”“Too many years with the weights and no stretching,” Edita said, putting twobottles of kombucha tea in the cart McGrath was pushing.“I always stretch. Just not like that. Ever. And not at five in the morning. Ifelt like my head was swelling up like a tick’s in some of those poses.”Edita stopped in front of the organic produce, started grabbing the makings of asalad, said, “What is this? Tick?”“You know, the little bug that gives you Lyme disease?”She snorted. “There was nothing about first yoga class you liked?”“I gotta admit, I loved being at the back of the room doing the cobra when allyou fine yoga ladies were up front doing downward dog,” McGrath said.Edita slapped him good-naturedly on the arm and said, “You did not.”“I got out of rhythm and found I kind of liked being out of sync.”She shook her head. “What is it with the men? After everything, still a mysteryto me.”McGrath sobered. “On that note, any luck finding what I asked you about theother day?”Edita stiffened. “I told you this is not so easy, Tom.”“Just do it, and be done with them.”She didn’t look at him. “School? My car? My apartment?”“I said I’d help you.”Torn, Edita said, “They don’t give a shit, Tom. They—”“Don’t worry. You’ve got the warrior McGrath on your side.”“You are hopeless,” she said, softening and touching his cheek.“Just when it comes to you,” he said.Edita hesitated and then blew him a kiss before leading them to the checkoutline. McGrath helped her unload the cart.“Why do you look like the lonely puppy?” Edita asked him as the checker beganringing them through.“I’m just used to a grocery cart with a little vice in it. Beer, at a minimum.”She gestured to a bottle on the conveyor belt. “This is better for you.”McGrath leaned forward and took it before the checker could.“Cliffton Dry?”“Think champagne made with organic apples, no grapes.”“If you say so,” McGrath said skeptically.As he loaded the food in cloth bags, Edita paid with cash from a little fannypack around her waist. McGrath wondered what his childhood buddies would sayabout his hanging out with a woman who bought Cliffton Dry instead of a six-packof Bud. They’d bust him mercilessly. But if apple bubbly was Edita’s thing, he’dgive it a try.He knew their relationship was a strange one, but he’d decided recently thatEdita was, for the most part, good for him. She made him happy. And she made himfeel young and think young, which was also a good thing.They grabbed the shopping bags. He followed her out into a warm drizzle thatmade the sidewalk glisten. Traffic was already building in the southbound laneof Wisconsin Avenue even at that early-morning hour, but it was still lightgoing north.They turned to head south, Edita a step or two ahead of him.A second later, McGrath caught red fire flashing in his peripheral vision, heardthe boom-boom-boom of rapid pistol fire, and felt bullets hit him, one of themin his chest. It drove him to the ground.Edita started to scream but caught the next two bullets and fell beside McGrath,the organic groceries tumbling across the bloody sidewalk.For McGrath, everything became far away and slow motion. He fought for breath.It felt like he’d been bashed in the ribs with sledgehammers. He went onautopilot, fumbled for his cell phone in his gym-shorts pocket.He punched in 911, watched dumbly as the unbroken bottle of Cliffton Dry rolledaway from him down the sidewalk.A dispatcher said, “District 911, how may I help you?”“Officer down,” McGrath croaked. “Thirty-two hundred block of Wisconsin Avenue.I repeat, officer…”He felt himself swoon and start to fade. He let go of the phone and struggled tolook at Edita. She wasn’t moving, and her face looked blank and empty.McGrath whispered to her before dying.“Sorry, Ed,” he said. “For all of it.”"},{"pageContent":" Light rain had begun to fall when John Sampson and I climbed out of our unmarkedcar on Rock Creek Parkway south of Mass. Avenue. It was only 6:30 a.m. and thehumidity was already approaching steam-room levels.The left lane was closed off for a medical examiner’s van and two DC Metropatrol cars and officers. Morning traffic was going to be horrendous.The younger of the two officers looked surprised to see us. “Homicide? This guykissed a tree going ninety.”“Reports of gunfire before the crash,” I said.Sampson asked, “We have an ID on the victim?”“Car’s registered to Aaron Peters. Bethesda.”“Thanks, Officer,” I said, and we headed to the car.The Maserati was upside down with the passenger side wrapped around the base ofa large Japanese maple tree. The sports car was heavily charred and all thewindows were blown out.The ME, a plump, brassy, extremely competent redhead named Nancy Ann Barton,knelt by the driver’s side of the Maserati and peered in with a Maglite.“What do you think, Nancy?” I asked.Barton looked up and saw me, then stood and said, “Hi to you too, Alex.”“Hi, Nancy,” I said. “Anything?”“No ‘Good morning’? No ‘Top of the day to you’?”I cracked a smile, said, “Top of the morning, Doc.”“That’s better,” Barton said and laughed. “Sorry, Alex, I’m on an old-schoolkick. Trying to bring congeniality back to humankind, or at least the humankindaround me.”“How’s that working for you, Nancy?” Sampson asked.“Pretty well, actually,” she said.“This an accident?” I asked.“Maybe,” she said, and she squatted down again.I knelt next to Barton, and she shone the light into the Maserati, showing methe driver. He was upside down, hanging from a harness, wearing a charred Bellhelmet with a partially melted visor, a neck brace, and a Nomex fire suit, thekind Grand Prix drivers used, right down to the gloves and booties.“The suit worked,” Barton said. “No burn-through that I can see. And the air baggave him a lot of protection. So did the internal roll bar.”“Aaron Peters,” Sampson said, looking at his smartphone. “Former Senate staffer,big-time oil lobbyist. No wonder he could afford a Maserati.”Standing up to dig out my own flashlight, I said, “Enemies?”“I would think by definition a big-time oil lobbyist would have enemies.”“Probably so,” I said, squatting back down. I flipped my light on and probedaround the interior. My beam came to rest on a black metal box mounted on thedashboard.“What is it?” the ME asked.“If I’m right, that’s a camera inside that box, probably a GoPro. I think he mayhave been filming his run.”“Would something like that survive a fire?” Sampson asked.“Maybe we’ll get lucky,” I said, then I trained the beam on the driver’sblackened helmet. I noticed depressions in the upper part of it that didn’t lookright.“You’ve photographed it?” I asked.Barton nodded. I reached up and released the buckle of the chinstrap. Gently butfirmly, I tugged on the helmet, revealing Aaron Peters. His Nomex balaclavalooked untouched by the fire, but it was blood-soaked from twothrough-and-through bullet wounds to Peters’s head.“Not an accident,” I said.“Impossible,” Barton agreed.My phone rang. I was going to ignore it but then saw it was chief of policeBryan Michaels.“Chief,” I said.“Where are you?”“Rock Creek,” I said. “Murder of an oil lobbyist in his car.”“Drop it and get to Georgetown. One of our own is down, part of a doubledrive-by, and I want our best on the scene.”I stood, motioned Sampson back toward the car, and broke into a trot, saying,“Who is it, Chief?”He told me. My stomach turned over hard."},{"pageContent":"* [part0006.xhtml#noteref_Footnote_66067] Mary’s name, some identifying details,and dialogue have been changed.† [part0006.xhtml#noteref_Footnote_66070] Joe’s name, some identifying details,and dialogue have been changed.* [part0008.xhtml#noteref_Footnote_66072] Wendy Dobbs’s name, some identifyingdetails, and dialogue have been changed.* [part0015.xhtml#noteref_Footnote_66074] Noel St. Pierre is a compositecharacter.* [part0017.xhtml#noteref_Footnote_66077] Alison’s name, some identifyingdetails, and dialogue have been changed.* [part0020.xhtml#noteref_Footnote_66079] Jenny’s, Francine’s, and Kristina’snames, some identifying details, and dialogue have been changed.* [part0021.xhtml#noteref_Footnote_66081] Cynthia Selleck’s name, someidentifying details, and dialogue have been changed.* [part0026.xhtml#noteref_Footnote_66084] Beverly Donatelli’s name, someidentifying details, and dialogue have been changed.* [part0042.xhtml#noteref_Footnote_9] Alicia’s name, some identifying details,and dialogue have been changed."},{"pageContent":"THANK YOU FOR BUYING THIS EBOOK, PUBLISHED BY HACHETTE DIGITAL.To receive special offers, bonus content, and news about our latest ebooks andapps, sign up for our newsletters.Sign Up [http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/newsletters]Or visit us at hachettebookgroup.com/newsletters[http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/newsletters]"},{"pageContent":"CONTENTS 1.
