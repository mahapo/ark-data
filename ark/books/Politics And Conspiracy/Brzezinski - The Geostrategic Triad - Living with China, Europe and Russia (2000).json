More than a decade after the abrupt c ollapse of the Soviet Union, and more than a decade after the renunciation of authoritarian political systems and statist economic policies in key developing co untries, a national consensus on how the United States as \"hyp erpower\" should navigate in the world is as elusive as ever. How can we explain the irony that the United Sta tes, at the moment of uncontested geostrategic preponderance, has no comprehensive basis for engag ing the rest of the world? There are a number of reasons. First, much of th e public debate on American international engagemen t is cast in iconic terms that may satisfy embedded political interests but do little for positioning the United States to capitalize on a dynamic global environment. In the post-Cold War period, the critical issues have beco me increasingly complex. New challenges have been supe rimposed on traditional issues. A constellation of global forces is calling long-standing sovereign prerogati ves and capabilities into question. All this defies bumper- sticker articulation. Second, the absence of a broad consensus has pro vided a greater opportunity for special interest gr oups to impose their priorities on the policymaking process . The result is a centrifugal process that cuts int o the capacity of leaders to formulate and carry out bala nced and consistent policies. Third, in the context of today's real-time news culture, political leaders are confronted with maki ng complicated decisions based on a multitude of facto rs in ever shorter time frames. The \"CNN effect\" ma kes crises across the world immediately relevant to lea ders who in the past would not have been affected b y those developments. The pressure for instant policy decla rations and formulation has grown tremendously. As a consequence, leaders have less time to think carefu lly about longer-range trends, confer with knowledg eable individuals, and contemplate approaches that are lo nger term and integrated in nature. Fourth, the organizational \"stovepipe\" phenomeno n of specialized jurisdictions, competencies, and i nterests across the U.S. government (as well as other govern ments) is creating increasingly segmented analyses of developments across the world. It is also generatin g turf battles and gridlock, infighting and paralys is, and lack of constancy of purpose. The constraints created by these organizational rigidities certainly apply to the range of traditional national security and foreign policy issues confronting the United States. But they are most pronounced when it comes to crosscutting global iss ues such as globalization, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, HIV/AIDS and the cross-border movement of other infectious diseases, and other similar fo rces. Fifth and last, the debate in both academia and the public policy community on how to position the United States relative to the rest of the world has been n o more productive. Despite Herculean attempts to id entify paradigms for U.S. engagement within a broader stra tegic framework, no overarching theory has emerged, no comprehensive strategy has succeeded in attracting political consensus, and no approach has enabled th e systematic prioritization of American interests and objectives. Together, these five elements have limited the c apacity of leaders to think in \"strategic\" terms—to assess relations with key states in a comprehensive fashio n, weigh both primary and derivative effects of pro posed policies, cast relations in a long-term time frame, and develop nn integrated approach to how Washingt on can and should define its relations with the world. The challenge is clear: American leaders must weigh al l dimensions of complex relationships, assign priorit ies to highly complex and sometimes competing objec tives, and fashion a strategy through which those prioriti es can be achieved. For these reasons, Zbigniew Brzezinski's unique geopolitical insight is all the more valuable. Over the course of his remarkable career in government and the publ ic policy arena, Dr. Brzezinski has consistently distinguished himself as a truly strategic thinker by grounding his analysis in historical understandi ng, exploring how sets of relations between countries c an and should be calibrated with other sets of rela tionships, advancing conclusions that are global in scope, and focusing on longer-range developments and trends. In addition, he has consistently attacked the question able assumptions and iconic thinking that have char acterized public debate on some of the big issues of our time s."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Dr. Brzezinski's analysis is testament to the fa ct that even in today's real-time decisionmaking en vironment, it is possible to formulate and prosecute a strategy b ased on a forward-looking, interdisciplinary approa ch. This monograph captures such an approach. The co nceptual staging point for the analysis that follow s is that the success of U.S. international engagement in the early twenty-first century will be conditioned lar gely by the United States' relations with Eurasia—the world's c entral arena of world affairs—and in particular wit h China, Japan, Russia, and Europe. In short, Dr. Brzezinski asserts, the United States needs a well-defined transcontinental strategy to maneuver effectively i n the twenty-first century. More specifically, he p oints to two \"Eurasian power triangles\" that Washington must dev elop as an organizing structure for its future enga gement: the first between the United States and the Europea n Union and Russia, and the second between the Unit ed States and Japan and China. This monograph lays out Dr. Brzezinski's thinkin g on the considerations that should underlie each o f these power triangles. For obvious reasons, each of these relationships involves separate and independent considerations. But they also share an important ch aracteristic: Of the two countries other than the U nited States in each triangle, only one recognizes its st ake in international stability. In the United State s-Japan-China triangle, Tokyo clearly is pursuing regional and in ternational policies that reflect an interest in se curity. Beijing, however, continues to favor more or less drastic al ternations in the geopolitical calculus. The same a pplies to Russia in the context of the United States-European Union-Russia triangle. The European Union, convers ely, serves with the United States as the axis of global stability. Also significant, as Dr. Brzezinski not es, is the important contrast between the two \"non-stake\" coun tries in the respective triangles. Beijing's econom ic progress suggests an altogether different set of pr iorities than the dire challenges—ranging from econ omic to health and demographic—facing Moscow. In managing these differing sets of relationship s, the challenge to Washington is to fashion a long er-range vision of its interests and role in Eurasia. That i mplies, of course, an outward-based strategy buildi ng on relations with our allies in Europe and Japan. In t his context, a number of looming policy issues—NATO expansion, European integration, the development of an autonomous European defense capacity, the balan ce between Washington, Tokyo, and Beijing, cross-Strai t relations—are likely over time to test traditiona l security, political, and economic relations. A long er-range vision also implies detailed and different iated strategies for dealing with Russia and China. What makes Dr. Brzezinski's analysis so signific ant is the clear and comprehensive conceptual road map he offers to address these issues. With these essays, he has articulated a strategy for the cornerstone o f U.S. policy—our relations with Eurasia—as we move forwar d into the millennium. In so doing he has made a significant contribution at ë significant time, and CSIS is pleased and proud to be able to publish th is volume. The three chapters that make up this volume were first published in successive issues of the Nation al Interest, and we thank its editor, Owen Harries, who is also a senior associate at CSIS, for permitting us to in corporate those separate articles into a single volume.

LIVING WITH CHINA EURASIAN POLITICS HAVE REPLACED EUROPEAN POLITICS AS THE central arena of world affairs. Onc e European wars became evidently threatening to America, there was no choice for America but to inject itself into Europe an politics in order to prevent new conflicts from erupting or a h ostile European hegemony from emerging. Thus America's engagement i n world affairs was precipitated during the twentieth centu ry by European politics. Today, it is the interplay of several Eur asian powers that is critical to global stability. Accordingly, Ameri ca's policy must be transcontinental in its design, with specific bi lateral Eurasian relationships woven together into a strategically c oherent whole. It is in this larger Eurasian context that U.S.- China relations must be managed and their importance correctly asse ssed. Dealing with China should rank as one of Washington's four most important international relationships, alongside Eu rope, Japan, and Russia. The U.S.-China relationship is both con sequential and catalytic, beyond its intrinsic bilateral importanc e. Unlike some other major bilateral relationships that are either particularly beneficial or threatening only to the parties direc tly involved (America and Mexico, for example), the U.S.-China r elationship impacts significantly on the security and policies of other states, and it can affect the overall balance of power in E urasia. More specifically, peace in Northeast and Southe ast Asia remains dependent to a significant degree on the state of the U.S.-China relationship. That relation ship also has enormous implications for U.S.Japan r elations and Japan's definition—for better or worse—of its p olitical and military role in Asia. Last but not le ast, China's orientation is likely to influence the extent to wh ich Russia eventually concludes that its national i nterests would best be served by a closer connection with an Atlanticist Europe; or whether it is tempted inste ad by some sort of an alliance with an anti-American Chin a. For China, it should be hastily added, the U.S.- China relationship is also of top-rank importance, alongside its relations with Japan, with Russia, and with India. In fact, for China the Beijing-Washington interacti on is indisputably the most important of the four. It is central to China's future development and well-bein g. A breakdown in the relationship would prompt a dramat ic decline in China's access to foreign capital and technology. Chinese leaders must carefully take int o account that centrally decisive reality whenever they are tempted to pursue a more assertive policy on behalf of their national grievances (such as Taiwan) or m ore ambitious global aspirations (such as seeking to re place American \"hegemony\" with \"multipolarity\"). In essence, then, in the complex American-Chines e equation, Beijing should be prudent lest its larg er ambitions collide with its more immediate interests , while Washington must be careful lest its strateg ic Eurasian interests are jeopardized by tactical miss teps in its handling of China. FOR HISTORICAL CLARITY It follows that the United States, in defining its longer-term China policy and in responding to the m ore immediate policy dilemmas, must have a clearly form ulated view of what China is, and is not. There is, unfortunately, enormous confusion in America on tha t very subject. Allegedly informed writings regardi ng China often tend to be quite muddled, occasionally even verging toward the hysterical extremes. As a r esult, the image of a malignant China as the inevitably anti-A merican great power of the 2020s competes in the Am erican public discourse with glimpses of a benign China ge ntly transformed by U.S. investors into an immense Hong Kong. Currently, there is no realistic consensus ei ther among the public or in the Congress regarding China."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" In recent years, inconsistency has also characte rized the attitude of the U.S. government. It is un fortunately the case that the Clinton administration has been g uilty of \"vacillation and about-faces on China, oft en in response to popular and congressional pressure,\" th at the President himself was \"not willing to protec t U.S.- China relations from tampering by Congress,\" and th at \"some in Congress would destroy the relationship if given the opportunity to do so.\"1 The presidential mishandling in late spring 1999 of the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations with the Chinese an d the persisting inclination of Congress to grandst and on the China issue validate that indictment. In addition, public perception of China tends to be defined by spectacular symbols that allegedly e ncapsulate the essence of today's and tomorrow's China. Thus, for many Americans Tiananmen Square and Tibet have come to reflect the central reality of enduring com munist oppression and of intensifying national chau vinism. For others, the Chinese economic \"miracle,\" dramati zed by the skyscrapers of Shanghai, and by China's growing free-market openness to the world through t he Internet, travel, and foreign investment, symbol izes a transforming nation that is progressively shedding its communist veneer. Which China, then, is the rea l China, and with which China will America clash or cohabit in the years to come? Having digested much of the available literature on Chinese political, economic, and military prosp ects, and having dealt with the Chinese for almost a quarter of a century, I believe that the point of departure toward an answer has to be the recognition of an obvious but fundamental reality: China is too big to be ignored , too old to be slighted, too weak to be appeased, and too am bitious to be taken for granted. A major and ancien t civilization—encompassing 20 percent of the world's population organized in a historically unique cont inuity as a single nation-state, and driven simultaneously by a sense of national grievance over perceived (and, in many cases, real) humiliations over the last two centuri es, but also by growing and even arrogant self-conf idence— China is already a major regional player, though no t strong enough to contest at this time either Amer ica's global primacy or even its preponderance in the Far Eastern region. China's military strength, both current and like ly over the next decade or so, will not be capable of posing a serious threat to the United States itself, unless China's leaders were to opt for national suicide.2 The Chinese nuclear force has primarily a deterrent capability. The Chinese military build-up has been steady but neither massive nor rapid, nor technologically very impress ive. It is also true, however, that China is capabl e of imposing on America unacceptable costs in the event that a local conflict in the Far East engages vita l Chinese interests but only peripheral American ones. In thi s sense, China's military power is already regional ly significant, and it is growing. Nonetheless, unlike the former Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China (PRC) is not capable of posing a universal ideological challenge to the United State s, especially as its communist system is increasing ly evolving into oligarchical nationalist statism with inherent ly more limited international appeal. It is notewor thy that China is not involved in any significant internatio nal revolutionary activities, while its controversi al arms exports are driven either by commercial or bilatera l state interests. (As such, they are not very diff erent from those of France or Israel, with the latter actually exporting weapons technology to China.) Moreover, in recent years China's international conduct has been relatively restrained. China did n ot exercise its veto to halt un-sanc-tioned military actions ag ainst Iraq over Kuwait. Nor did it block the Securi ty Council's approval of the international protectorate in Kosov o. It approved the deployment of UN peacekeepers in East Timor, and—unlike India in the case of Goa, or Indo nesia when it seized East Timor—it peacefully re-ac quired Hong Kong and more recently Macau. China also acted responsibly during the Asian finan-ci.il crisis of 1998, for which it was internationally applauded. Last bu l not least, its current efforts to gain membership of the WTO, whatever the merits or demerits of China's neg otiating stance, signal the PRC's growing interest in global multilateral cooperation. Internal Contradictions The picture becomes more mixed when the domestic sc ene in China is scrutinized and when current Chines e views of the United States are taken into account. China is basically unfinished business. Its communi st revolution has run out of steam. Its post-communist reformation has been partially successful, particu larly at the urban-industrial-commercial levels, but this has re quired major doctrinal concessions and compromises. The"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"result is that the Chinese system is a hybrid, with strong residues of communist dogmatism in the indu strial sectors and in the state bureaucracy coexisting une asily with dynamic, capitalist entrepreneurship dri ven by foreign investment. China's future systemic orienta tion is thus yet to be fully defined, but it is alr eady evident that the cohabitation within it of communism and co mmercialism is inherently contradictory. The trajectories of China's economic change and of its political evolution are thus parting. At som e point, the distance between them will become too wide to susta in. Something, then, will have to give. Moreover, t he existing political elite—itself not so young—will s oon be replaced by a generation that came to politi cal maturity neither during the Great Leap Forward nor during the Cultural Revolution, both epiphenomena o f communist doctrinal exuberance. The emerging politi cal elite matured during Deng Xiaoping's pragmatic upheaval in the Chinese economy, and hence may be m ore inclined to correct the political trajectory of China's evolution, bringing it closer to the economic traje ctory. The issue of human rights is thus likely to beco me more acute as the political regime seeks one way or another to close the gap between itself and its evo lving socioeconomic context. The constraints on per sonal political liberty, the denial of religious freedom, and the suppression of minorities—most notably in Tibet— cannot be sustained in a setting of growing social and economic pluralism. The recent efforts to suppr ess the Falun Gong movement testify to the regime's sense o f ideological and political vulnerability. Accordin gly, the issue of freedom is bound to become both more criti cal and more difficult for the existing regime to m anage. Indeed, it is almost safe to predict that in the ne ar future—probably within the coming decade—China w ill experience a serious political crisis. In any case, whatever its political prospects, C hina will not be emerging as a global power in the foreseeable future. If that term is to have any real meaning, i t must imply cutting-edge superiority of a truly gl obal military capability, significant international financial and economic influence, a clear-cut technological lead , and an appealing social lifestyle—all of which must combin e to create worldwide political clout. Even in the most unlikely circumstance of continued rapid economic g rowth, China will not be top-ranked in any of these domains for many decades to come. What is more, its backward and debilitated social infrastructure, co mbined with the per capita poverty of its enormous populat ion, represents a staggering liability. One should note here that some of the current sc are-mongering regarding the alleged inevitability o f China's emergence as a dominant world power is reminiscent of earlier hysteria regarding Japan's supposedly predestined ascendancy to superpower status. That h ysteria was similarly driven by mechanical projecti ons of economic growth rates, without taking into account other complex considerations or unexpected continge ncies. The Japanese purchase of Rockefeller Plaza became a t one point the symbol of the paranoiac, one-dimens ional glimpse into Japan's future. Be that as it may, China's unsettled domestic sc ene is likely to reinforce an inherently ambivalent and occasionally antagonistic attitude toward the Unite d States. Though Chinese leaders recognize that the y need a stable and even cooperative relationship with the U nited States if their country is to continue develo ping, China is no longer America's strategic partner against a threatening Soviet Union. It became so after the Sh anghai breakthrough of 1972 and, even more so, after llie normalization of relations in 1980, which dramatica lly transformed a three decade-long adversarial relatio nship into a decade of strategic cooperation.' Toda y, with the Soviet Union gone, China is neither America's adver sary nor its strategic partner.4 It could become an antagonist, however, if either China so chooses or America so prompts. Accentuating the Negative Currently, Chinese policy toward the United States is a combination of functional cooperation in areas of specific interest and of a generally adverse defini tion of America's world role.5 The latter has promp ted Chinese diplomatic initiatives designed to undercut U.S. global leadership. Chinese policy toward Russ ia is ostentatiously friendly on the rhetorical level, wi th frequent references to \"a strategic partnership. \" Such is also the case (perhaps not surprisingly) with Sino-Frenc h relations, with both sides proclaiming (as, for e xample, during the October 1999 Paris summit between Presid ents Chirac and Jiang) their passionate fidelity to the concept of global \"multipo-larity\"—not a very subtl e slam at the disliked American \"hegemony.\""},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Indeed, the word \"hegemony\" has become the favor ite Chinese term for defining America's current wor ld role. Chinese public pronouncements and professiona l journals that deal with international affairs reg ularly denounce the United States as an overreaching, domi nant, arrogant and interventionist power, increasin gly reliant on the use of force, and potentially tempte d to intervene even in China's internal affairs. The NATO action in Kosovo precipitated especiall y a massive outpouring of Chinese allegations that America has embraced the concept of interventionism at the expense of respect for traditional national sovereignty, with dire implications for China. As o ne alarmed Chinese expert put it: Suppose serious anti-Communist Party or anti-govern ment domestic turbulence erupts in China, which can not be quickly brought under control, and, at the same time, the international community commonly joins th e anti- China stream. In this case, the hegemonists (perhap s jointly with their allied nations) could launch a military invasion of China.6 The above was neither an extreme nor an isolated assertion. Such charges have been accompanied by g rowing concern that the United States is accelerating and intensifying its efforts to construct an anti-Chine se coalilion in the Far East, embracing what is represented as a dangerously rearming Japan, South Korea and also T aiwan, a coalition \"that resembles a small NATO of East As ia.\"7 American, Japanese and South Korean discussio ns of possible collaboration against theater missile atta cks have intensified these Chinese suspicions. Occa sional American and Taiwanese press speculation that Taiwa n might be included in such a collective effort has also further aggravated the Chinese, who see it as addit ional evidence that the United States is increasing ly inclined to make permanent the current separation of Taiwan from China. Perhaps the most striking example of the current Chinese inclination to stress the negative dimensi ons of the U.S.-China relationship is the attempt to provide a deeper intellectual or cultural rationalization fo r the seemingly intensifying antagonism. The Chinese-owne d Hong Kong daily, Ta Kung Pao, published a major editorial entitled \"On the Cultural Roots of Sino-U .S. Conflict\" in September 1999, advancing the thes is that \"the conflict between Chinese and American civiliza tions is at a deeper level one between sacred and s ecular lifestyles.\" Amazingly for a nominally communist re gime, it is China that is said to represent the for mer: \"Chinese civilization has always stressed an integr ation of heaven with man.\" This identity is said to contrast sharply with \"the consumerist and hedonist mode of behavior that grew out of American Civilization,\" m aking Americans \"look down on Oriental Civilization, hold ing that it is backward and ignorant.\" The policy i nference that was drawn from the foregoing was stark: \"in Ch ina-U.S. relations, it will be absolutely impossibl e to permanently resolve conflicts of political views in areas such as human rights, democracy, and freedom .\"8 To be sure, the foregoing views are in part inst rumental, for they are also meant to serve the curr ent Chinese efforts to put America on the ideological defensive . They do not define for Beijing the overall charac ter of the U.S.-China relationship. Since China seeks to reduc e the scope of America's global preponderance (and its resulting leverage on China), it needs some sort of a doctrinal legitimation for controlled antagonism ; yet China also wants to retain for itself, for obvious reason s of domestic self-interest, the vital benefits of collaboration with America. Striking a balance between the two is not easy, especially given the fact that China's c ommunist leaders have not found an effective substitute for their previous Marxist world-view. That central rea lity imposes a severe restraint on Chinese anti-American proclivities. Hence, U.S.-China military links are being prese rved, economic ties enhanced and political relation s kept relatively congenial—even while \"multipolarity\" is hailed and \"hegemony\" condemned in joint declaratio ns with Moscow, Paris and whoever else cares to join. The result is a confused amalgam, involving communi st terminology and Chinese nationalist sentiments. Tha t mishmash reflects the ambivalent position in whic h the Chinese leadership finds itself both at home and at large, given the unresolved ambiguities of Chinese domestic and foreign policy. Doubtless, China's leaders, generally intelligen t and hardheaded, sense that inherent ambiguity. Th ey must realize that Paris, rhetoric aside, will not join i n some fanciful Beijing-Moscow-Paris anti-American coalition. They have to know that Russia does not have much to offer to China, except perhaps some technologicall y not very advanced military equipment. Ultimately, they have to understand— and their conduct reflects that they"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"do—that at this historical juncture the relationshi p with the United States is central to China's futu re. Outright hostility is simply not in China's interest. The foregoing points toward a further observatio n. China today, in relationship to the wider intern ational system, is neither the militarist Japan of the 1930 s nor the ideologically and strategically threateni ng Soviet Union of the 1950s-70s. Though all analogies, by de finition, are partially misleading, there are some important parallels between China's current situation and imp erial Germany's circa 1890. At that time, German po licy was in flux, while Germany itself was a rising power. L ike today's China, Germany's ambitions were driven by a resentment of a perceived lack of recognition and r espect (in the case of Germany, especially on the p art of a haughty British Empire, and in the case of today's China, on the part of an arrogant America), by fear s of encirclement by a confining and increasingly antago nistic coalition, by rising nationalistic ambitions on the part of its predominantly young population, and by the r esulting desire to precipitate a significant rearra ngement in the global pecking order. One will never know with any certainty whether t he European war of 1914, a quarter of a century lat er, could have been avoided by wiser policy in the 1890s. Sim ilarly, one cannot be certain about which direction China will head over the next quarter of a century. Howev er, already at this stage it should be self-evident which prospect is to be avoided. For America, that requir es a strategically clearheaded management of the se nsitive issue of Taiwan and, even more so, of the longer ra nge task of fitting China into a wider and more sta ble Eurasian equilibrium. What China Is and Is Not: A Decalogue 1. China is neither an international adversary nor a strategic partner of the United States, though it is hostile to perceived U.S. \"hege mony.\" 2. China is not going to become a global power, tho ugh it is a regional power capable of asserting its national interests. 3. China is not a direct security threat to the Uni ted States. 4. China does not pose a global ideological challen ge to the United States. 5. China is not regionally destabilizing and is in fact behaving internationally in a relatively respo nsible fashion. 6. China is neither totalitarian nor democratic pol itically but an oli garchic-bureaucratic dictatorsh ip. 7. China is not in compliance with universal standa rds of human rights and of tolerance for minorities in places such as Tibet or Xinjiang. 8. China is evolving economically in a desirable di rection. 9. China is not likely to avoid serious domestic po litical strains because commercial communism is an oxymoron. 10. China does not have a clear vision of its polit ical evolution or of its international role. FOR STRATEGIC PROPORTIONALITY The Taiwan Question For America, Taiwan is a problem; China is the chal lenge. Taiwan complicates U.S.-China relations, but it is U.S.-China relations that will determine in large m easure the degree of stability or instability in th e Far East and, more generally, in Eurasia. Admittedly, how th e Taiwan issue is handled will influence—and in som e"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"circumstances could even determine—the evolution of U.S.-China relations. But, except for its impact o n those relations, the status of Taiwan itself is not a cen tral international concern. Still, it is important to take both history and strategy into account when addressing the sensitive and volatile issue of Taiwan's relationship with the mainland. T hat issue is a direct legacy of China's civil war. It is also an unresolved legacy, for Taiwan's separate existence reminds that neither side involved in the civil war succeeded in totally eliminating the other. Though one side w on by gaining control over the mainland, and thus o ver the vast majority of the Chinese population, the losing side still preserved itself not only as a politica l entity but also as a potential political alternative, even tho ugh entrenched on a relatively small island inhabit ed by only 2 percent of China's people. That Taiwan succeeded in preserving its independ ence from the side that emerged victorious in the C hinese civil war has been due mainly to the United States. America, though indirectly, continued to be involv ed in that war even after its termination on the mainland in 1 949. It both protected and bolstered Taiwan. Episod ic military clashes in the Taiwan Strait occurred unti l the de facto suspension of the civil war in the 1 970s—a suspension attained by direct U.S.-China talks init iated under President Nixon and later formalized th rough the normalization of U.S.-China relations under Preside nt Carter.9 The resulting arrangement was genuinely creative, for it enabled the winning side to acquie sce to the de facto partition of China as the trans itional outcome of the civil war without accepting it as a permanent de jure reality. That sensible accommodation was made possible by the acceptance on both sides of the intricate form ula whereby (1) the United States acknowledged that in the view both of the mainland and of Taiwan there i s only one China; and (2) the United States affirmed that it expects the issue of reunification to be resolve d peacefully (and that U.S. national interest would be engaged i f it should be otherwise); whereas (3) the Chinese reiterated that reunification is an internal Chinese matter, t o be attained by whatever means China deems appropr iate, though their preference is also for a peaceful reso lution. Once that hurdle had been traversed it followed that the officially recognized government of China had to be the one that governs 98 percent of the Chinese peop le. And it also followed that Taiwan could not be recognized as a separate \"sovereign\" state, though the United States could maintain practical and func tional ties with it. Such ties were then formally legislated by the U.S. Congress in the \"Taiwan Relations Act\" of 1980, which regularized U.S. relations with Taiwan withou t defining it as a sovereign state. In effect, the outcome of the great bargain preserved the formal unity of Chi na while practically respecting the current reality of a separate status for Taiwan. That arrangement has proven to be a blessing for Taiwan, while simultaneously permitting the develo pment of extensive U.S.-China ties. Taiwan's resulting pr osperity hardly needs documenting. It has blossomed both as an economic miracle and as a democracy in the more secure setting of abated Sino-American tensions, of continued U.S. arms sales, and of the openly procla imed U.S. stake in a peaceful Taiwan Strait. Taiwan 's success has also provided stunning and encouraging evidence for the proposition that democracy and Chi nese culture are compatible, an example that has signifi cant long-term implications for the future evolutio n of mainland China. Taiwan has not only prospered economically and f lowered politically but has become a respected and active participant in various international organizations. For example, it is a full member of the Asian Deve lopment Bank, APEC and the Central American Bank for Econom ic Integration, and is currently seeking access to the WTO. It maintains regular economic, technological a nd cultural ties with more than 140 states with whi ch it does not have formal diplomatic relations. An even more impressive testimonial to the benef its accruing from the U.S.-China normalization of r elations has been the actual pacification of the Taiwan Stra it. In contrast to the sporadic clashes that used t o occur prior to normalization, there has been a massive flow of capital and people across the hitherto separating w ater.10 These socioeco-nomic ties, in turn, have permitted the emergence of an informal but serious dialogue b etween representatives of the respective authorities. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Lee's Unilateralism That informal accommodation was jeopardized in the second half of 1999 by the unilateral redefinition of Taiwan's relationship to the mainland, abruptly lau nched by the Taiwanese authorities. In a highly pub licized interview, President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan suddenl y abandoned the \"One China\" formula, redefining the Taiwan-mainland relationship as involving \"state-to -state relations.\" The import of the new formulatio n was self-evident: one China was brusquely redefined as two separate states. Moreover, Lee in a subsequent statement insisted that the inhabitants of Taiwan h ave acquired a \"fresh national identity based on th e New Taiwanese consciousness.\"11 Lee's initiative was launched without any prior consultations with the United States. It was immedi ately followed, however, by stepped-up efforts by Taiwane se supporters in the United States, encouraged by a well- financed Taiwan lobby, to induce the U.S. governmen t, through congressional pressure, to take a stand in support of Taiwanese \"sovereignty.\"12 Various suppo rters of Taiwan also launched a public campaign all eging a growing Chinese military threat to Taiwan, urging particularly the Republican presidential candidate s to support the so-called \"Taiwan Security Enhancement Act,\" introduced earlier in the year in the U.S. Co ngress. That proposed act aimed at nothing less than the de facto revival of the 1955 Mutual Defense Treaty wi th the Republic of China (terminated following the U.S. re cognition of the People's Republic of China), with its specific and non-discretionary provisions designed to restore Taiwan as a U.S. military ally against C hina. It should be noted that these alarmist pressure tactics disregarded the fact that the PRC currently lacks, and in the foreseeable future will not have, the airlift a nd sealift capability to effect a successful 120-mi le, cross-strait amphibious invasion. One need only recall the enorm ous difficulty of the Normandy landings in 1944 acr oss the narrower English channel, in spite of overwhelm ing allied air and naval supremacy as well as the r elative weakness of the German forces. In contrast, the Tai wanese ground forces that would be resisting any la nding communist forces are relatively better armed and mo re mobile. Taiwan also has the means to contest PRC efforts to assert air and naval superiority in the Taiwan Strait. It is also noteworthy that the U.S. secretary of defense, in an assessment issued in February 1999, concluded that only \"by 2005, the PLA [People's Liberation Ar my] will possess the capability to attack Taiwan wi th air and missile strikes which would degrade key militar y facilities and damage the island's economic infrastructure.\"13 Even then, the acquisition of su ch a capability would not mean that the PRC could e xecute an effective invasion. One must also take into account Taiwan's capacity to retaliate effectively by stri king or mining China's major ports, thereby cutting China's trade links with the entire world. In any case, whatever may have been Mr. Lee's mo tives in publicly venting the formula of \"state-to- state relations,\" there was no pressing security need for his unilateral initiative. Hence the question: cui bono? Since the Taiwanese leadership had to know that it would complicate U.S.-China relations and generate new te nsions in the Taiwan Strait, one has to assume that the in itiative was taken (at least in part) on the calcul ation that any U.S.-China military confrontation, even if provoked by Taiwan, would work to Taiwan's political advant age. For the United States, acquiescence to the new f ormulation and passage of the proposed \"Taiwan Secu rity Enhancement Act\"14 would mean that Taiwan has been granted nothing short of a carte blanche to redefin e its status as it wishes, with the United States obligat ed to defend the island, come what may. It would am ount to a de facto unconditional guarantee of U.S. protection for whatever provocative step Taiwan might take, i ncluding even a formal secession from China, and thus it wou ld be a repudiation of prior U.S.-China undertaking s. It is also important to note that in any ensuing hostilit ies in the Taiwan Strait, the United States would f ind itself altogether isolated internationally. For China, the proposed U.S. legislation would s ignal America's re-engagement in the Chinese civil war, while Beijing's acquiescence to the new \"state-to-s tate\" formulation would mean the formal acceptance of the permanent partition of China. Neither is a palatabl e choice for Beijing. It would also mean that, in t he eyes of the Chinese, the grand bargain with the United Stat es had been exploited by Washington, first to conso lidate Taiwan, and then to transform a separatist Taiwan i nto a permanent U.S. protectorate. No current Chine se leader could accept such an outcome and normal rela tions between the United States and the PRC would thereby be jeopardized."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" The Clinton administration was, therefore, fully justified in repudiating the new Taiwanese formula and in reassuring Beijing that previous U.S.-China underst andings remained in force. For some time to come, Washington will have no choice but to navigate care fully between the risk inherent in any unconditiona l assurances to Taiwan's security and the obligation to discourage any Chinese attempt at coercive unifi cation. Perhaps an additional bilateral Washington-Beijing clarification regarding Taiwan might be helpful if it were to involve a clear-cut Chinese commitment (expressed, naturally, as a unilateral Chinese decision) never to use force in order to achieve national 'unity, matched by a simultaneous—and similarly \"independent\"—U.S. commitment to terminate all arms sales to Taiwan if it should formally declare itself to have seceded from China. However, even then, the U.S.-China relations hip would still remain vulnerable to disruption bec ause of the unresolved and always sensitive issue of Taiwan 's future. That is why it is unlikely that either s ide would be willing to exchange such mutual assurances. Democracy: The Essential Condition Ultimately, the issue of Taiwan will be determined primarily by what happens in China itself. A China that fails to evolve politically, or that flounders socially—n ot to speak of a China that regresses ideologically —will not attract Taiwan. Nor will it intimidate Taiwan, for the United States will continue to have a tangible national interest in the prevention of warfare in the Taiwan Strait. It follows that Taiwan will, and should, c ontinue to have prudently measured access to the necessary U.S . military wherewithal for self-defense. In contrast, a successfully developing and progr essively democratizing China may eventually be able to reach some practical arrangement with Taiwan. It might do so by enlarging the \"one country, two systems\" for mula (currently applied to Hong Kong) to \"one country, s everal systems.\" The \"one country, two systems\" formula was unvei led, with considerable publicity, by Deng Xiaoping during my meeting with him in Beijing in 1984. It was expl icitly designed to accommodate Taiwan. In 1997, dur ing a visit to Taiwan, I used the phrase \"one country, se veral systems,\" having in mind—in addition to China —Hong Kong, Macau and perhaps eventually Taiwan. In an in terview with the London Times (October 18, 1999), President liang tantalizingly observed, in speaking of \"the main objectives for China by the middle of the next century,\" that, \"We will ultimately resolve the que stion of Taiwan and accomplish the great cause of n ational reunification by adhering to the policy of 'peacefu l reunification and one country, two systems' after the successful return of Hong Kong and Macao.\" (The ita licized passages [my emphasis] clearly hint at hist orical patience.) At this stage, it is not possible to be more pre cise, but Taiwanese spokesmen are generally correct in postulating that China's democratization is the pra ctical precondition for any arrangement that may ap proximate (and eventually become) reunification. It thus foll ows that the real strategic challenge for the Unite d States— more important than the issue of Taiwan—pertains to China's evolution, both in its domestic politics a nd especially with regard to the global mindset of its ruling elite. That evolution can be subtly influenced from the outside, even if a democratic transformation of Ch ina cannot be so imposed. Positive change in China will come, in the main, from socioeconomic pressures, unleashe d (in part, unintentionally) by the ruling elite's otherw ise rational economic reforms. Their cumulative eff ect, especially because of modern mass communications, i s inherently incompatible with enduring political repression. In that context, the cause of human rig hts can be, and should be, deliberately supported f rom the outside, even at the cost of some friction with Chi na's rulers. China, however, is not America's client state. N or does it pose a global ideological challenge like the former Soviet Union, in which case it was useful to put th at country on the defensive by making human rights into a major issue. Indeed, a policy of sustained ideologi cal confrontation with China is more likely to dela y desired changes by stimulating more overt regressive reacti ons from an increasingly insecure political elite. Given the ongoing changes within China, including its evident trend toward more openness to the world, the promo tion of human rights in the country is likely to be more ef fective if pursued with deliberate indirection. For example, extensive programs to assist the Ch inese in embracing the rule of law are bound to hav e a significant democratizing impact. Indeed, as the ne gative experience of post-Soviet Russia shows, loud"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"emphasis on electoral democracy can prove to be sel f-deceptive. In contrast, the institutionalized spr ead of the rule of law can create enduring foundations for gen uine democratization while enhancing the prospects for a functioning market economy. Since the ruling elite finds the latter to be in its interest, the propaga tion of the rule of law is both politically easier and in the l ong run more effective. Similarly, the development of functional assista nce to local officials, who in increasing numbers a re subject to election, should be a major focus of an enlightened but not strident program on behalf of human rights . The stronger and more democratic the local government, the weaker the central controls. Yet here, too, the top political elite is susceptible to seductive co-opta tion since it realizes that an effective local gove rnment is necessary for successful modernization. Human right s can thus be piggy-backed onto China's own domesti c ambitions. The U.S. Congress would be well advised to bear the above strictures in mind, while providi ng more support for various nongovernmental organizations e ngaged in helping the Chinese to develop a genuine civil society. The matter of Tibet is more intractable, especia lly since a strategy of indirection is not responsi ve to the more immediate grievances of the Tibetan people. Hence, on this issue a public stance of disapproval is una voidable. At some point, the Chinese government may conclude that the costs to China's reputation are too high, and that some creative application of the \"one country, seve ral systems\" formula would provide a more construct ive solution to what is clearly a major violation of es tablished international norms for the treatment of ethnic minorities. Direct talks with the Dalai Lama would represent a significant step in the right direction , and continued U.S. support for the Tibetan people is th us in order. The Japan Factor Effective management of these delicate issues is mo re likely if the United States sustains a policy th at progressively enhances the Chinese stake in a peace ful Northeast Asia and in a constructive Chinese ro le in a stable Eurasian power equilibrium. Only in that lar ger context can the salience of the Taiwan issue ev entually be subsumed and the formula of a democratic and pro sperous China as \"one country with several systems\" become reality. Moreover, just as the United States could not have conducted a successful policy towar d the Soviet Union without simultaneously calibrating mos t carefully its relations with liuropc, so American policy toward China must also be, almost by definition, n triangular policy, shaped with Japan very much in m ind. China is especially sensitive to anything pertai ning to Japan and its changing international role. China views Japan both as a historic rival and as an extension of U.S. power. The character and scope of the U.S.J apan alliance is hence a matter of the utmost importance to Beijing. And, not surprisingly, the Japanese ar e similarly preoccupied with China and its relationship with th e United States. Particularly striking was the obse rvation by Democratic Party of Japan President Yukio Hatoyama that, \"We should make more efforts to reinforce Chi na's confidence in Japan because we are not certain what the future holds for U.S.-China relations.\" Hatoya ma added: \"It cannot completely be ruled out that Wash ington and Beijing will not compete with each other over hegemony. Thus, it is potentially somewhat dangerou s to consider it safe to always side with the Unite d States.\" It is no exaggeration to say that whether Japan rem ains primarily allied with America, or instead arms itself and acts largely on its own in Asia, will be predominan tly determined by how well or badly the United Stat es handles its relations with China.15 The consequences of this triangular reality cut two ways. For China, the key implication is that Be ijing would be wise to exercise self-restraint in its anti-Amer ican \"hegemony\" campaign. It could backfire badly f or China. Overheated Chinese rhetoric about an anti-American coalition with Russia (and perhaps also with India) might prompt even stronger pressures in America on behalf of an anti-Chinese, U.S.-led alliance embracing no t only Japan and South Korea but even Taiwan. Some in Amer ica might also advocate a strategic counter toward India, on the grounds that India is wary of China a nd that it shares America's democratic credentials. The Chinese should also be aware that latent but ingrow n anti-Chinese sentiments, once given the opportuni ty, could quickly come to dominate Japanese politics. In fact, anti-Chinese sentiments in Japan, espec ially in its foreign policy establishment, are visi bly on the rise. In the words of Nobuo Miyamato, the Director of the Nomura Research Council, even though a joint declaration by Japan and China talks about a 'frien dly and cooperative partnership', Japan and China w ill not be"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"able to extricate themselves from a relationship of political and strategic competition for the next 5 0-100 years.16 Open Sino-American hostility would most likely spur an intense arms race between Japan and China, to the detriment of both the stability of, and the America n position in, the Far East. Though neither America nor Japan can exclude the possibility that China may, indeed, become a threat—and hence their alliance is also a form of insurance—it is neither in America's nor in Japan's interest to precipitate that threat. Hence an anti -Chinese alliance with a rearmed Japan should be America's l ast, and not first, strategic option. Accordingly, for America the key implication is that the United States has to be very deliberate in balancing the inevitable readjustment in U.S.-Japan defense c ooperation, pointing toward an enhanced internation al security role for Japan, with the imperative of sen sitivity for Chinese concerns. The Chinese are conv inced that Japan is irrevocably committed to significant remil itarization and that its sharp edge is pointed at C hina. The Chinese press very deliberately plays up any Japane se statements that can be construed as anti-Chinese . Thus even the most authoritative Chinese newspaper went into paroxysms of anger when the newly elected gove rnor of Tokyo, Ishihara Shintaro—known also for his atta cks on the United States—referred to Taiwan as Japa n's \"peripheral state.\"17 The United States, therefore, must be especially careful to make certain that a more militarily powerful Japan is fully integrated into a larger cooperative security system in Northeast A sia and is not poised primarily as America's anti-Chinese ally . It follows also that increasing U.S.-Japan secur ity cooperation in the Far East should be designed in a manner that does not mimic NATO's originally overt focus o n the Soviet Union's aggressive intentions. For the present, China does not have the capacity for genuinely seri ous regional aggression. Accordingly, ongoing U.S.- Japan- South Korea defense planning as well as joint exerc ises should avoid an overtly anti-Chinese cast. In addition, China should be included, as much as possible, in t he emerging multilateral dialogue regarding regiona l security. It has taken years, and much American eff ort, to precipitate serious three-way U.S.-Japan-So uth Korea military discussions. Some four-way U.S.-Japan-Chin a-South Korea defense consultations have also been initiated, and these may become gradually more form al. The key point to bear in mind here is that regi onal security in Northeast Asia is not a zero-sum game; how China is treated might well become a self-fulfi lling prophesy. The politically sensitive issue of Theater Missi le Defense (TMD) is very germane to the above comme nts. Handled well, a TMD system could be regionally stab ilizing; handled badly, it could spark intense U.S. -China hostility while setting off in Japan a polarizing a nd destabilizing debate over Japan's relations with the United States and with China. Accordingly, two important p recautions are in order. The first is that no regio nal U.S.- Japan-South Korea TMD should include Taiwan either formally or through direct deployment. Taiwan can b e de facto covered by a TMD located on U.S. naval pla tforms, thereby avoiding the Chinese charge that th e United States is reverting by the back door to a fo rmal defense arrangement with Taiwan. Secondly, consultations with the Chinese regarding any eventu al missile system should be held on the same basis as proposed to Russia. There is no compelling reason t o treat China differently. More generally, it is also important to make the utmost effort to stimulate a comprehensive strateg ic dialogue with China regarding not only the security of North east Asia but of Eurasia more generally. Whenever p ossible, it should be a triangular dialogue, involving also the Japanese. Appropriate subjects should include t he future of Russia (a topic rarely discussed in depth with the Chinese—yet of vital importance to China, given its far larger population, rapidly growing economy, and the emptin ess of the neighboring Russian Far East18), the sta tus of the Central Asian states (with their energy resourc es being of great interest to both China and Japan) , stability in Southeast Asia, and the unstable relationship be tween nuclear-armed India and Pakistan. Developing and institutionalizing such a dialogue, and especially making it truly trilateral, will require a major ef fort and much time, but promoting it should be viewed as a high U .S. strategic priority. Over time, a successful three-way dialogue, as w ell as a cooperative (and not unilateral) approach to the TMD issue, may foster a greater Chinese inclination to resolve peacefully the division of Korea. That divi sion, the last major unresolved territorial-political legacy of the Cold War, is increasingly anomalous. However , its constructive resolution requires not only China's a ssent but its actual participation. That participat ion will"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"become more likely when China begins to view itself as part of a larger security scheme in the Far Eas t in which America and Japan are not perceived as its po tential adversaries. A three-way strategic dialogue could in turn pav e the way for a broader Eurasian security forum, sp anning America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. The west of the Eurasian continent is already highly organiz ed through NATO and the EU, and these integrated struc tures overlap with Eurasia's volatile \"middle zone\" through the fifty-four member Organization for Secu rity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which includ es Russia and the Central Asian states. In the east, i nstitutionalized security cooperation involves only the formal U.S.-Japan and U.S.-South Korea treaties as well as the informal Japan-South Korea consultations. Chin a is not formally engaged, and there is no equivalent to the loosely cooperative OSCE. At the very least, a ser ious five- way strategic dialogue might prompt the redefinitio n of the letter e in OSCE from \"European\" to \"Euras ian\" through the inclusion in an expanded and redefined OSCE of a dozen or so Asian states. Ten Basic Principles and Premises for U.S.-China Re lations 1. The future orientation of China, and not the fut ure of Taiwan, should be America's central strategi c concern. 2. An anti-Chinese defense arrangement with Taiwan should not be indirectly revived, and U.S. arms sal es should be carefully cali brated in relation to the state of U.S.-China relations and PRC capabilities. 3. Peaceful reunification can be promoted only by a democratizing and increasingly prosperous PRC on t he basis of a \"one country, several systems\" formula. 4. Respect for human rights in China should be fost ered by a policy of indirection focused on the bene fits of the rule of law. 5. The U.S.-China-Japan relationship is highly inte ractive, in a manner reminiscent of the U.S.-Europe an- Soviet relationship. 6. The United States should promote a trilateral st rategic dialogue with China and Japan regarding the security of Eurasia. 7. A pre-emptive anti-Chinese defense coalition, ba sed on TMD, could become a self-fulfilling prophecy of a hostile China. 8. The OSCE should be expanded to include Asia, fol lowing five-way security talks involving the United States, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. 9. The G-8 should be enlarged to G-9 by the inclusi on of the PRC. 10. The ultimate U.S. goal should be a China that e volves into a genuinely vested partner in an increa singly cooperative Eurasian system. Dealing China In The task of assimilating China into a wider Eurasia n equilibrium has to be pursued on other fronts as well. In addition to shaping a more sustained triangular rel ationship with China and Japan, China's accession t o the WTO and the regularization of normal trade relation s between the United States and China would be sign ificant steps in the gradual integration of China into the world economy. Much the same applies to the question of China's inclusion in the G-8 (which I have been advocating for more than three years). The G-8 summit has become a hybr id, neither a forum for the democracies nor a concl ave of the most advanced economies. That dual formula was compromised by the politically expedient decision t o include Russia, hardly an advanced economy and ques tionably a democracy. Similar political expediency, therefore, should dictate the inclusion of the econ omically much more dynamic China, with the G-9 ther eby"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"becoming a more genuine global power forum. That wo uld propitiate China's quest for status while also enhancing its stake in the emerging global system. In some respects, China's international behavior is already no worse, and may be even better, than India's. New Delhi over the years backed various forms of So viet aggression, went to war with its neighbors mor e often than China, flaunted its disregard for nuclear non- proliferation, used force to resolve some colonial legacies such as Goa, has been careless of human rights in K ashmir, and has proved no less obstreperous than Ch ina in the WTO negotiations. Yet no leading presidential c andidate in America has labeled India as America's major \"competitor,\" as was the case with China in late 19 99. Obviously, India's democratic credentials give its external ambitions a more benign cast, but the comp arison with India—like China a very poor, developin g, but also politically aspiring power—should help to plac e in perspective the somewhat over-heated fears of China. Still, it is important to reiterate that China i s unlikely to become America's strategic partner ag ain in the manner that it was during the decade starting with the late 1970s. The most that can reasonably be exp ected, barring a serious domestic or international crisis, is that China will gradually become an increasingl y cooperative player in the international \"game,\" in which the major participants play according to shar ed rules even while each keeps his own score. As a major reg ional player, China will occasionally collide with the United States, but it is also likely to find that i ts long-run interests are better served by observin g common standards. China may thus become neither a formal a lly nor a declared enemy of America but an importan t partici-pant in the evolving international system, increasingly meeting and grudgingly accepting more and more of that system's conventions. Such an internationally more cooperative China w ill have an important geostrategic effect on Eurasi a. Given Russia's evident fears of China's larger economy an d population, such a China will be much more likely to push Moscow toward the Atlanticist Europe than a China t hat is antagonistic toward the United States. At th e same time, such a China will reinforce Japan's stake in a stable alliance with America without frightening Tokyo either into rapid rearmament or into divisive tensi ons with the United States. It follows that the central strategic task of U. S. policy toward China should be nothing less than the attainment of a fundamental, truly historic shift i n the mindset of the Chinese elite: to view China n o longer as the self-isolated Middle Kingdom, or as the Celesti al Empire, or as the aggrieved victim, or as the wo rld's revolutionary center—but, more prosaically, as a ve sted partner in Eurasian stability and as a key pla yer in the global system.

LIVING WITH A NEW EUROPE THE TRANSATLANTIC ALLIANCE IS AMERICA's MOST IMPORTANT GLOBAL relationship. It is the springboar d for U.S. global involvement, enabling America to play the de cisive role of arbiter in Eurasia—the world's central arena of pow er—and it creates a coalition that is globally dominant in al l the key dimensions of power and influence. America and Euro pe together serve as the axis of global stability, the locomoti ve of the world's economy, and the nexus of global intellectual capit al as well as technological innovation. Just as important, they a re both home to the world's most successful democracies. How the U. S.-European relationship is managed, therefore, must be Washing ton's highest priority. In the longer run, the appearance of a truly pol itically united Europe would entail a basic shift in the distributi on of global power, with consequences as far-reaching as those g enerated by the collapse of the Soviet empire and by the subsequent emergence of Americans global preponderance. The impact of such a Europe on America's own position in the world and on the Eura sian power balance would be enormous (see the table on the fol lowing page for an indication of how a united Europe would dwar f the United States), inevitably generating severe two-way trans atlantic tensions. Presently, neither side is well equipped to handle such potentially significant change.

It should be noted, however, that the operative wor ds in the preceding paragraph regarding the signifi cance of a truly united Europe are \"would be.\" A European Unio n with genuine political weight and unity is not foreordained. The emergence of such a Europe depend s on the depth of its political integration, on the scope of Europe's external expansion, and on the degree to w hich Europe develops its own military as well as po litical identity. The decisive steps in these regards have yet to be taken. Currently, Europe—despite its economic strength, significant economic and financial integration, an d the enduring authenticity of the transatlantic friendsh ip—is a de facto military protectorate of the Unite d States. This situation necessarily generates tensions and r esentments, especially since the direct threat to E urope that made such dependence somewhat palatable has obvious ly waned. Nonetheless, it is not only a fact that t he alliance between America and Europe is unequal, but it is also true that the existing asymmetry in pow er between the two is likely to widen even further in America's favor. This asymmetry is due both to the unprecedented strength of America's economic expansion and to the technological innovation that America pioneers in s uch complex and diverse fields as biotechnology and information technology. What is more, the American- led technological revolution in military affairs en hances not only the scope of the military reach of the Uni ted States, but also transforms the very nature and uses of military power itself. Regardless of any collective action on the part of the European states, it is h ighly unlikely that Europe will be able to close the military gap with America at any point in the near future."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" As a result, the United States is likely to rema in the only truly global power for at least another generation. And that in turn means that America in all likeliho od will also remain the dominant partner in the tra nsatlantic alliance for the first quarter of the twenty-first century. It follows, therefore, that transatlantic debate will not be about fundamental alterations in the nature of the relationship, but rather about the implications of anticipated trends and the corresponding yet somewhat more marg inal adjustments. That said, it hardly needs to be added that even incremental adaptations can breed conflic ts, which should be avoided if the U.S.-European relationship is to remain constructive and truly co operative. HISTORICAL DIFFERENCES A basic historical mystification both inspires and complicates the ongoing dialogue between America an d Europe. Both sides instinctively think of America w hen they dream of a united Europe. The Europeans cr ave America's continental scale and global standing, an d, in their more effervescent moments, they even en visage a future Europe as a global superpower co-equal to Am erica. The Americans, when welcoming—occasionally somewhat skeptically—Europe's future unity, instinc tively draw on their own historical experience. Tha t vision renders some U.S. foreign policymakers uneasy, for the inescapable presumption is that Europe—when it \"unites\"—will become America's peer, and potentiall y its rival. The American experience is often invoked by Euro pean statesmen in Europe's march to unity (one such figure recently declared to me that the European Union tod ay is somewhere between 1776 and 1789). Yet most European political leaders realize that the Europea n Union lacks both the ideological passion and the civic loyalty that inspired not only the framers of Ameri ca's Constitution but—and this is the crucial test of political commitment—those prepared to make the ultimate sacr ifice for the independence of the American colonies . As of now, and for the foreseeable future, it is simpl y the case that no \"European\" is willing to die for \"Europe.\" It follows that Europe, as it integrates, will b e something altogether novel in the history of poli tical entities, both in form and in substance. It will doubtless be a polity, in addition to being globally a niosl si gnificant single economy. As a polity, however, it will lack the emotional and idealistic commitment that the Un ited States evoked when it look shape. That commitment w as expressed in a transcendental concept of politic al liberty, proclaimed to enjoy universal validity, th at provided both the philosophical foundation and a politically attractive lieacon lor a new nation-state. The comm itment ol those who lonnded that stale, and of thos e who later flocked to it and became assimilated by it, w as almost religious. In short, the American revolut ion created a new kind of nationalism, one that was open to all , a nationalism with a universal face. The Preamble to the U.S. Constitution conveys th e singular character of that American commitment to national unity and liberty: We, the people of the United States, in order to fo rm a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promo te the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establis h ... Nothing quite like it characterizes the drumbeat of the European nations' march toward a common Europe . It is striking that the Treaty of Rome, the historic 1957 pledge of six European nations \"to lay the foundat ions of an ever closer union,\" places emphasis in its very ope ning on ensuring \"economic and social progress,\" on \"constant improvements of the living and working co nditions,\" on \"the removal of existing obstacles\" t o \"balanced trade and competition,\" on \"the progressi ve abolition of restrictions on international trade ,\" and so on. It is an admirably pragmatic, but also pedestri an, document. To emphasize this essential difference between A merica and Europe is not to denigrate the historica l significance of Europe's undertaking. Nor is it to question the good faith of those Europeans engaged in creating a new architecture. It is to note that the defining motivation of the European enterprise has , over time, become one of convenience and practicality. The ini tial impulse for European unity was more idealistic . Europe's \"founding fathers\" of the late 1940s and e arly 1950s were inspired by a transnational politic al conviction and very much motivated by the determina tion to end, once and for all, the nationalistic co nflicts that twice in this century came close to destroying European civilization. They were also fearful that America, disenchanted by European feuds, might simply abando n the European nations to the other great historica l"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"option—also \"unifying\" in its own ugly way—the one east of the Cold War's new dividing line \"from Stet tin to Trieste.\" Today's Europeans are serious about Europe in a more pragmatic way, though some—as noted earlier—do dream of an entity that will match America. French statesmen, at times unable to conceal their hyper-e nvy of America's global standing, see in Europe the recove ry of France's past grandeur. The Germans have soug ht in Europe their own redemption. The British, more skep tical, have finally concluded that there will be a Europe of sorts and that they must be in it if they are to in fuse some genuine significance into their own speci al relationship with America. Other peoples on the Con tinent—including the recently liberated peoples of Central Europe—also wish to be European, because they share the view that to be part of Europe is to be more s ecure, more prosperous and free. None of these motivations are base, all are historically justified, and they deserve America's respect. Nonetheless, pragmatism differs in substance as well as in its effects from patriotism. A polity co nstrued on convenience is bound to be different from a polity derived from conviction. The former can still gener ate loyalty. It can create a shared community. But it i s also likely to be less ambitious, politically les s assertive and, above all, less inclined toward idealism and person al sacrifice. Despite some similarities in scale, t he \"Europe\" that is actually emerging is thus likely to be poli tically quite different from America: a hybrid of a huge transnational corporation, to which it is prudent a nd convenient and even gratifying to belong, and of a confederated state that over time may also gain the genuine loyalty of its hitherto distinctive commun ities. In short, the European polity of convenience will be l ess than a United States of Europe, though more tha n just a European Union Incorporated. Indeed, it is no aspersion on anyone or any stat e to suggest that on I he global scene the emerging Europe is likely to be more similar to a Swit/.erland writ la rge than to the United States. The Swiss constituti on—which ended inter-communal strife—stresses that the ethni cally differentiated Swiss Cantons resolved \"to ren ew [their] alliance,\" ihal they were \"determined to li ve [their] diversity in unity respecting one anothe r,\" and won I on to identify the practical purposes of the Confed eration. Abroad, ihe main emphasis of Switzerland's international engagement has been in the important areas of international finance and trade, while avo iding engagement in this century's global political-philo sophical conflicts. Integration, Not Unification In any case, it seems reasonable to conclude that \" Europe,\" in the foreseeable future, will not be—ind eed, cannot be—\"America.\" Once the implications of that reality are digested on both sides of the Atlantic, the U.S.- European dialogue should become more relaxed, even as the Europeans address the dilemmas connected wit h their simultaneous quest for integration, expansion and some militarization; and even as the Americans adjust to the inevitable emergence of a novel European polity . Unification of several peoples normally occurs a s a result of external necessity, shared ideologica l commitment, domination by the most powerful, or som e combination thereof. In the initial phase of the European quest for unity all three factors were at play, though in varying degrees: the Soviet Union w as a real threat; European idealism was nurtured by the still fresh memories of World War II; and France, exploi ting West Germany's sense of moral vulnerability, was ab le to harness Germany's rising economic potential i n support of its own political ambitions. By the end of the century, these impulses have perceptibly wan ed. As a result, European \"integration\"—largely a process of regulatory standardization—has become the alternat ive definition of unification. Yet while integration is a perfectly sensible way of achieving an operation ally effective merger, a merger still falls quite short of an emotionally meaningful marriage. The plain fact is that bureaucratically spearhea ded integration simply cannot generate the politica l will needed for genuine unity. It can neither stir the imaginat ion (despite the occasional rhetoric about Europe b ecoming America's peer) nor develop the mortal passion that can sustain a nation-state in a time of adversity. The 80,000 page-long acquis communautaire (organized into 31 p olicy sectors)— which a new member of the European Union must ratify—is not likely to)provide the aver age European with the needed nourishment for politi cally energizing loyalty. However, it should be reiterate d that by now, given the absence of the other three more"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"traditional ways of seeking unity, integration is n ot only necessary but is the only way that Europe c an move forward toward \"unity.\" That gap between \"unification\" and \"integration, \" in turn, explains why integration is bound to be slow; and why, were it somehow accelerated too sharply, it co uld even divide Europe once again. Indeed, any atte mpt to accelerate political unification would probably int ensify internal tensions between the leading states within the Union, since each of them still insists on preservi ng its sovereignty in the critical area of foreign policymaking. At this stage, anti-Americanism as the impetus for unity—even when disguised by talk of \"multipo-larit y\"— cannot be a unifying force as anti-Sovietism once w as, because most Europeans do not subscribe to it. Moreover, with Germany reunited, no one in Europe, outside of Paris, still regards France as the putat ive leader of the new Europe—but also no one in Europe desires Germany to become Europe's dominant leader. Integration, however, is not only a slow process , but each successful step increases the very compl exity of the undertaking. Integration inherently means an increm ental and highly balanced progression toward deepen ing interdependence among constituent units, but their growing interdependence is not infused with the uni fying political passion required for the assertion of gen uine global independence. That may happen eventuall y, when Europeans come to view themselves politically as Eu ropeans while remaining, for example, German or Fre nch as a matter of linguistic and cultural peculiarity. Horizontal Expansion In the meantime, because of Europe's slow progressi on, external expansion is likely to become a partia l compensation for the crawling pace of internal inte gration. Europe will grow, but more horizontally ll ian vertically since, as a practical matter, the two ca nnot significantly advance at the same time. This p ainful reality is a sensitive point among Europe's true believers. When Jacques Delors dared to declare llally in ear ly 2000 that \"the pace [of enlargement] is unquestionably b eing forced ... we thus risk diluting the blueprint \" for European integration, with the result that \"we will inevitably move away from a political Europe as de fined by Europe's founding fathers,\" he was almost immediate ly and publicly taken to task by a compatriot EU Commissioner, Michel Barnier. The Commissioners in Brussels hope that bureaucr atic streamlining and institutional renewal will in vigorate the process of integration. Buoyed by the modest su ccess of the euro—despite some apocalyptic predicti ons from its largely American and British detractors—Br ussels has moved forward, in anticipation of signif icant expansion, with the long-standing inter-governmenta l conference on the renewal of the European institu tions. Key institutional decisions are to be made by the e nd of the year. But even the most forceful proponen ts of expansion concede that, at best, politically signif icant integration will have to be confined for a wh ile to the smaller inner core of the EU, thus perhaps creating a so-called \"multi-speed and variable geometry\" Eu rope.1 Yet even if that were to happen, it is doubtful tha t this formula would resolve the basic tension betw een integration and expansion in so far as the developm ent of a common foreign policy is concerned. Such a Europe would mean division into first and second-class mem bers, with the latter objecting to any major foreig n policy decisions taken on their behalf by a directorate of allegedly more truly European states. In any case, enlargement, too, is bound to becom e an increasingly absorbing and complicated task. W ith some two hundred EU teams about to begin the tedious pro cess of negotiating the modalities of accession wit h the dozen or so new aspirant nations, expansion will pr obably slow down, both because of its inherent comp lexity and because of a lack of will on the part of EU mem ber states. In fact, the admission of any Central E uropean state by 2004 is becoming increasingly problematic. In the longer run, however, expansion cannot be av oided. An amputated Europe cannot be a true Europe. A geop olitical void between Europe and Russia would be dangerous. Moreover, an aging Western Europe would begin to stagnate economically and socially.2 No wonder, then, that some leading European planners h ave begun to advocate a Europe of as many as thirty -five to forty members by the year 2020—a Europe that wou ld be geographically and culturally whole, but almo st certainly politically diluted.3 A Decalogue Regarding European Developments and Pro spects"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"1. For most Europeans, \"Europe\" is not an object of personal affection. It is more a convenience than a conviction. 2.

A Question of Muscle Thus, neither integration nor expansion is likely t o create the truly European Europe that some Europe ans crave and some Americans fear. Indeed, an increasing numb er of Europeans do sense that the combination of th e euro and integration with slow expansion can only create economic sovereignty. Political awareness that mor e is needed prompted the three leading European states—F rance, Great Britain and Germany—to join in 1999 in an effort to create a credible European military capab ility, and to do so even before an integrated Europ e with a defining foreign policy of its own emerges. The pro jected European military force is meant to put some muscle behind a common foreign and security policy (ClvSP) , which is to be shaped by the newly created post o f Europe's High Representative for External Relations and Common Security. The proposed joint European rapid reaction force , which is to be operational by 2003, will be the f irst tangible manifestation of a political Europe. In contrast to the already existing, but largely symbolic, \"Euroc orps\"— composed primarily of French, German, Spanish and o ther draftees and possessing neither mobility nor r eal military capability—the planned force would be asse mbled when needed from pre-dedicated combat units, would number up to 60,000 men deployable within 60 days, and would be sustainable in a theater of deployment \"in or around Europe\" for at least a yea r. In effect, according to various European estimat es, such a force would be equivalent to a full corps, supporte d by some 150 to 300 aircraft, 15 large combat vess els, a strategic air transport capability, and the requisi te C3I (command, control, communications and intell igence). European military experts are to conduct an acceler ated audit of the inventory of the available Europe an assets so that the force can engage in peacekeeping or eve n in some (otherwise unspecified) limited combat operations. Its appearance would mark the emergence of a genuine European Security and Defense Identit y (ESDI), capable of military action outside of NATO. However, the European defense initiative—driven by the genuinely felt sense of Europe's military in adequacy revealed by the Kosovo w;ir, fueled by French ambit ions, but tempered by British and German inclinatio ns to reassure the Americans—has yet to pass three basic tests: will the force be rapidly deployable, will i t be militarily capable, and will it be logistically sus tainable? Europe has the means to create such a for ce; the question is whether it has the will. At this stage, skepticism is very much in order. European defense leaders have stated that the forc e can be assembled without additional expenditures through a very deliberate reallocation of existing defense b udget items, a proposition that defies common sense. It i s evident to serious European commentators that the planned"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"force will require improvements in central logistic s control, joint military depots, and presumably so me joint exercises. That would entail additional costs, not to mention the more basic need for adequate reconna issance and intelligence as well as for a more competitive and more consolidated European defense industry. Ye t in recent years the overall percentage of the European budgets allocated to defense as well as to defense -related R&D has actually been declining, with European defe nse expenditures having fallen in real terms by abo ut 22 percent since 1992. The critical fact is that political parsimony un dermines the military seriousness of the venture. A s Daniel Vernet wrote in Le Monde in September 1999, for the European force to come into being, the Europeans \" must know exactly what they want, define defense restruc turing programs (politically sensitive and financia lly costly), and, finally, allocate the budgetary resou rces to match their ambitions.\" In addition, to sus tain a force of 60,000 men in the field for more than a year, a rot ational pool of about 180,000 combat-ready European soldiers must be available. It is not. A further complication, casting additional doubt on the credibility of the proposed enterprise, is that some European states are members of (he HU but not of NA TO (the \"neutrals\"), and others of NATO but not of (he HU (America's \"Trojan horses,\" according to some Hu ropeanisls). Their prospective relationship to ESDI is thus unclear and, in any case, il inevitably compli cates the picture. Finally, but perhaps mosl import ant of all, the meshing of the proposed force with existing NAT O arrangements could become disruptive operationall y and divisive politically. Ultimately, the most probable outcome for ESDI i s that the proposed force will produce neither a ri val to NATO nor the long-missing second European \"pillar\" for a more equal alliance. Although the Europeans w ill probably somewhat enhance their own military planni ng and joint command structures, especially after t he expected absorption of the Western European Union b y the EU itself, more likely is the piecemeal emerg ence over the next five or so years of a somewhat improv ed European capability to provide for non-NATO peacekeeping in some not overly violent European tr ouble spot (most likely in the Balkans). In effect, the so- called European pillar will be made less out of ste el and concrete and more out of papier-mache. As a result, Europe will fall short of becoming a comprehensive global power. Painful as it may be for those who wo uld like to see a politically vital Europe, most Europe ans still remain unwilling not only to die but even to pay for Europe's security. FOR STRATEGIC DIRECTION U.S. policymakers should keep in mind a simple inju nction when shaping American policy toward Europe: do not make the ideal the enemy of the good. The ideal from Washington's point of view would be a politic ally united Europe that is a dedicated member of NATO— o ne spending as much on defense as the United States but committing the funds almost entirely to the upg rading of NATO's capabilities; willing to have NATO act \"out of area\" in order to reduce America's global b urdens; and remaining compliant to American geopoli tical preferences regarding adjacent regions, especially Russia and the Middle East, and accommodating on su ch matters as international trade and finance. The goo d is a Europe that is more of a rival economically, that steadily enlarges the scope of European interdepend ence while lagging in real political-military indep endence, that recognizes its self-interest in keeping Americ a deployed on the European periphery of Eurasia, ev en while it chafes at its relative dependence and half-heart edly seeks gradual emancipation. U.S. policymakers should recognize that \"the goo d\" actually serves vital American interests. They s hould consider that initiatives such as ESDI reflect the European quest for self-respect, and that carping i njunctions— a series of \"do nots\" emanating both from the State and Defense Departments—merely intensify European resentments and have the potential to drive the Ger mans and the British into the arms of the French. M oreover, American opposition to the effort can only serve to convince some Europeans—wrongly—that NATO is more important to U.S. security than it is to Europe's. Last but not least, given the realities of the Euro pean scene, what ESDI poses for NATO are problems of process no t ones of principle, and problems of process are no t likely to be constructively managed by elevating th em into issues of principle. Hence, dramatic warnings of \"decoupling\" are cou nterproductive. They have a theological ring to the m, and as such they threaten to transform differences that can be accommodated into ones involving doctrinal debates."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"They are reminiscent of earlier NATO collisions tha t accomplished nothing good—whether over the aborti ve Multilateral Nuclear Force initiative of the early 1960s, which accelerated the French nuclear program ; or, more recently, the brief spasm in 1999 of American-pushe d efforts to revamp NATO into some sort of a global (\"out of area\") alliance, which quickly came down to eart h with the outbreak of the Kosovo war. Such dispute s detract and distract from a fundamental reality: NA TO, a truly remarkable success, may be far from per fect but it does not require a dramatic overhaul. One should pause here and ask: Even assuming tha t the new European force were to come into being by 2003, where and how could it act on its own? What c redible scenario can one envisage in which it could act decisively, without advance guarantees of NATO supp ort and without some actual dependence on NATO assets? Let us assume è conflict in Estonia, with t he Kremlin stirring up the Russian minority and the n threatening to intervene; Europe would not lift a f inger without direct NATO involvement. Suppose Montenegro secedes and Serbia invades; without U.S. participation, the planned European force would probably be defeated. While social unrest in some E uropean province say, Transylvania, or even Corsica !— might prove more susceptible to ë deployment of Eur opean peacekeepers (much as has been the case in Bosnia), such an intervention is hardly an example of Europe becoming \"an independent actor on the international stage,\" to quote French Defense Minis ter Alain Richard. In a genuinely serious mission, the planned Euro pean force still would have to rely heavily on NATO assets in the key areas of reconnaissance, intelligence an d airlift. These assets are primarily American, tho ugh dedicated to NATO. Thus, NATO would be de facto inv olved, even if initially it had exercised its optio n of first refusal. In brief, if the crisis is serious, the Eu ropean reaction will not be independent; if the rea ction is independent, the crisis will not be serious. To be sure, adjustments within NATO will be unav oidable as Europe slowly evolves into a more define d polity. ESDI will make NATO's decision-making proce sses somewhat more cumbersome, and European contributions to NATO's own military enhancement ma y even marginally suffer as the EU seeks some sort of force of its own. ESDI, especially after the Europe ans organize within the EU some sort of a European defense organism, will also have the effect of stimulating a shared European strategic perspective, which Amer ica will have to take into account. But a shared European se curity posture is more likely to emerge through the gradual consolidation of the European defense industry4 and intensified European military planning than throug h any precipitous leap—especially by 2003— into an autono mous European combat capability. Indeed, of greater consequence to NATO's future than the European under-performance revealed during the Kosovo war is Europe's nonperformance after the Kos ovo war. The staggering fact is that \"Europe\" not o nly cannot protect itself but cannot even police itself . The inability of the European states to engage en tirely on their own in effective peacekeeping in a small and weak region—and their reluctance to provide the nee ded financing for its economic recovery— poses a more s erious long-term challenge to NATO's cohesion than does ESDI. It is likely to breed growing American uneasi ness regarding the proper role for U.S. forces comm itted to Europe's defense. In the nearer term, an even more divisive issue— one of greater strategic import—may be generated by U.S. plans to deploy a missile defense system. The ongoi ng debate in the United States over missile defense has been driven primarily by domestic political conside rations, and a unilateral American decision, made i n the heat of a U.S. presidential race, would doubtless be bad ly received in Europe. Indeed, American unilaterali sm on this matter could have far graver consequences than even the most intense U.S. concerns regarding ESDI 's alleged \"decoupling\" effect on American and Europea n security. If transatlantic security ties are to b e sustained as America's central strategic priority, it is clea rly better at this stage to engage in comprehensive discussions with America's allies regarding the feasibility, th e costs, the defense trade-offs, and the political as well as strategic effects of a missile defense deployment. In any case, it is too early to make a prudent judg ment as to how urgently needed and how practicable such a defe nsive shield may be. That is a decision for the nex t U.S. president to make. In the meantime, a basic strategic priority of t he United States should be the continued expansion of NATO. NATO enlargement offers the best possible guarantee of continued transatlantic security ties. It serve s to create a more secure Europe, with fewer areas of geopoliti cal ambiguity, while increasing the European stake in a vital"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"and credible alliance. Indeed, the case can be made that the 1999 NATO decision to return to the issue of enlargement no earlier than 2002 should be revised, and that a serious effort to decide on new members should be made in 2001, once a new U.S. president is in of fice. Several countries appear to be ready for incl usion, meeting not only the standards set recently for Pol and, the Czech Republic and Hungary, but even previ ously for Spain. An earlier resumption of the process of enlargement would provide a clear signal that not o nly does the transatlantic security link remain vital, but t hat America and Europe are both serious about shapi ng a secure Europe that is truly European in scope. American support for the resumption of NATO enla rgement is consistent with the American stake in expansion of the EU. The larger Europe becomes, the less likely it is that either external or internal threats will pose a serious challenge to international peace. Mo reover, in the longer run the more overlap there is in membership between NATO and the EU, the greater wil l be the cohesion of the transatlantic community an d the more compelling the complementarity of the Atla nticist and Europeanist visions. It is a felicitous fact that some of the candidates currently qualified for eith er NATO or EU membership happen to be the same countries. The United States can argue persuasively that Slovenia, Slovakia and Lithuania already meet , or are close to meeting, the criteria for NATO membership. According to a comparative study prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers, several Central European st ates (including Slovenia and Estonia) are more qualified—in terms of macroeconomic stability, GNP, economic interaction with the EU, and economic infrastructure—for EU membership than was Greece. P oland and the Czech Republic—both already NATO members—were recently listed in the Economist as be ing more qualified than Italy! Which makes it all t he more egregious that \"the present accession requirem ents are more numerous and stringent than those tha t were faced by the South European countries that joined t he EU earlier.\"5 A Decalogue of Basic U.S. Policy Premises and Guide lines 1. Europe remains America's natural and pre-eminent ally. 2. An Atlanticist Europe is essential to a stable E urasian equilibrium. 3. An autonomous European defense capability, in an y case unlikely in the near future, should not be o pposed by the United States. 4. Allied political unity is more important than th e enhancement of NATO's capabilities. 5. The United States should defer any deployment de cision regard ing a ballistic missile defense syste m until consensus is reached with NATO allies. 6. The United States should seek an enlarged NATO i n Europe but not an \"out of area\" NATO. 7. The United States has a bigger stake in Europe's enlargement than in Europe's integration. 8. NATO and the EU should work together on joint pl ans for further expansion. 9. Eventually, Turkey, Cyprus and Israel might be i ncluded in both entities. 10. There should be no a priori limitations or excl usions on NATO and EU memberships. That some countries merit entry into the EU and NATO should facilitate and encourage stronger U.S. support for the enlargement of both. High-level NATO-EU con sultations regarding a staged, progressive and cont inuing expansion therefore would be very much in order. Bu t it is premature at this stage even to speculate a s to what might be the eventual outer boundaries of the two, hopefully overlapping, entities. Much will depend o n the evolution of Russia, for whom the doors to an Atlan ticist Europe should be kept open. An expanded EU overlapping with NATO can encourage Russia's positi ve evolution by dampening old imperial temptations. Russia may then recognize its own interest in accom modating and becoming associated with NATO. If it d oes not, then a larger NATO will provide the needed sec urity for a larger Europe. But in any case, the a p riori exclusion of any qualified European state from eith er NATO or the EU would be unwise."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" Moreover, from a geopolitical as well as economi c point of view, it is not too early to note that o nce both NATO and the EU have expanded to include the Baltic and some southeastern European states, the subsequ ent inclusion not only of Turkey but of Cyprus (followi ng a Turkish-Greek accommodation) and of Israel (following a comprehensive peace with all its neigh bors) may also become desirable. In addition, as Eu rope expands, the transatlantic community at some point will have to respond to signals from countries such as Ukraine, Georgia and even Azerbaijan, that their lo ng-term objective is to qualify for participation i n the great historical undertaking occurring within the EU and under NATO's security umbrella. In promoting this great project, the United Stat es should remain supportive of the EU's quest for d eeper integration, even though that support will be mainl y rhetorical. The United States has wisely avoided identifying itself with the conservative British op position to Europe's political as well as monetary unity, and it should likewise avoid the occasional temptation to display Schadenfreude when Europe stumbles. Precise ly because European integration will be slow and becau se the European polity will not be like America, Am erica need not fear the emergence of a rival. The transat lantic relationship is more like a marriage that bl ends together mutually respected differences—including s ome division of labor—as well as commonalties, and both in fact serve to consolidate the partnership. That has been the case over the last half century, and i t will remain so for some time to come. In fact, the evolving character of the internati onal system should reinforce the transatlantic bond . Europe and the United States account jointly for less than 15 percent of the world's population and are highly vi sible as islands of prosperity and privilege in a seething a nd restless global environment. In this age of inst ant communications, an awareness of inequality can be r apidly translated into political hostility targeted at those who are envied. Hence, both self-interest and a sen se of potential vulnerability should continue to pr ovide the underpinning for a durable U.S.-European alliance. The European polity, situated on the western edg e of Eurasia and in the immediate proximity of Afri ca, is more exposed to the risks inherent in rising global tumult than the politically more cohesive, militar ily more powerful and geographically more isolated America. The Europeans will be more immediately at risk if a chauvinistic imperialism should again motivate Russ ian foreign policy, or if Africa and/or south-centr al Asia suffer worsening social failures. The proliferation ) of nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction a lso will endanger luirope more, given Europe's limited milit ary capabilities and the proximity of potentially t hreatening states. For as far as one can see, Europe will cont inue to need America to be truly secure. At the same time, a close relationship with Euro pe philosophically legitimates and gives focus to A merica's global role. It creates a community of democratic s tates without which the United States would be lone ly in the world. Preserving, enhancing and especially enlargi ng that community—in order to \"secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity\"—must theref ore remain America's historically vital task.

He does not transform it into a probl em of principle, which could divide the two sides o f the Atlantic. Being more than skeptical about the abili ty of the Europeans to accomplish what they have em barked upon, he gives the American administration a piece of sound advice: do not fear the emergence of a riv al. Brzezinski has a good case, underpinned by argument s that are hardly dismissible. Let me stress a few of them: 1. Integration has replaced unification as the u ltimate goal of the Euro pean process. It will be a slow process, as a too speedy one could divide Eu rope r ather than unite it. 2. Europe will grow horizontally rather than ver tically, and widening is not compatible with deepen ing. 3. ESDI—the European Security and Defense Identi ty—does not represent a threat to NATO because, eve n in the most optimistic hypothesis, it will be effectiv e only in unserious crises. 4. NATO and the EU should extend at the same pac e, excluding no country a priori and including clos e association with Russia. Russia should recognize th at this combined NATO-EU enlargement does not contradict its owninterests. If it does not do so, NATO and EU enlargements will be needed to provide security to an expanded Europe. Brzezinski seems to accept the Attali vision of a Europe from the Atlantic to Vladivostok, which is inconsistent with the dream of the founding fathers of the Common Market and the European Community. T hat dream envisaged the new Europe not only as a free-t rade zone but as an international actor, a politica l partner for America—maybe not a global power for this gener ation or the next one, but a regional power, not on ly overcoming the historical conflicts between its mem ber states but exporting security and possibly pros perity to its \"near abroad.\" Brzezinski is right: there is a contradiction be tween this vision—traditionally supported by every French government but not necessarily shared by all its pa rtners in the EU—and the present shape of Europe. H e is also right to point out that this situation will probabl y not change in the next few years. In some matters (the institutions, for example) Europe is more likely to accommodate the existing framework than to make th e profound changes needed by a grand bond en avant. I n other matters (such as defense), it lacks either the will or the means, or both, to have a common policy; in par ticular, it lacks the political will to allocate mo re resources to defense budgets, without which it will be imposs ible for Europe to have a common foreign and securi ty policy."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" All these points are indisputable. However, the future of the European Union does not look quite as bleak as described by Brzezinski. Up to now, Europe has not reached a point of no return, which could make the original vision impossible. Furthermore, every measure taken in the last decade— single market, euro, free circ ulation of people inside Europe (the so-called \"Schengenlan d\"), nomination of a High Representative for Extern al Relations and Common Security, a modest but realist ic step toward a European defense—leaves open the possibility of future improvements, even if they wo uld not be spectacular ones. All options are still on the table. Take the projection forces. Brzezinski rightly n otes that the European reaction will not be indepen dent if the crisis is serious. For the time being, that is cert ainly so. But an independent reaction in a less tha n vital conflict would be a major step forward compared with the ina bility and unwillingness of the Europeans to act in some low-intensity crises of recent years. Let us take t he first step before the second. Europe will not be a military power, but it will not set limits to its ambition and be a soft power , the kind of larger Switzerland Brzezinski refers to. Since the end of World War II the American attit ude regarding European integration has always been ambiguous: unify, but not too much. The end of the Cold War has not altered this ambivalence: poor Eur ope that is incapable of going beyond a limited integra tion; happy America that has such an ally. Christoph Bertram, contributing editor, Foreign Pol icy For all its many good points, Brzezinski's prescrip tion for the future U.S.European relationship is, i n the final analysis, a complacent and hence a flawed one. It c an be summed up in one sentence: Europe, far from t urning into a rival for the United States, will remain a d ependent variable, a useful tool for U.S. strategy to spread stability to as many countries outside Russia as po ssible by incorporating them; it should be humored but not regarded as an equal partner by the United States. On one issue Brzezinski is right: there is no ne ed for Americans to panic as the EU tries to speed up defense integration. The angry fluster in some Washington c orridors caused by plans for modest if urgent impro vements in European capabilities for \"out of area\" military intervention has no justification: whatever comes of the plan, in the event European forces will have to draw on U .S. assets and hence to gain prior U.S. agreement. But to make military power the litmus test of Eu ropean integration is to repeat Stalin's mistake of judging the Catholic Church by the number of its divisions. Eve n Brzezinski, that most European of American realpolitikers, does not understand what this emerg ing Europe is really about. For him, it is \"a polit y construed on convenience,\" not \"conviction,\" a pragmatic devi ce for shared prosperity and stability. But pragmat ism fails to explain the extent to which proud states, steepe d in their respective histories, have sacrificed na tional autonomy for European interdependence. What drove t hem to submit to the authority of common laws and a common supreme court, to create a common currency, to unite the western part of the Continent, to invi te the new democracies of the rest of Europe into their mi dst, and now to try and develop the means for auton omous military action was never merely convenience. It wa s, and is, a certain idea of what Europe should be. The power of this idea should not be underrated. Americans used to recognize this, patiently but pe rsistently encouraging efforts at European integration during all the decades of the Cold War. Now, perhaps out o f irritation over Europe's new-found confidence, coup led with a one-track fascination with their own mil itary and technological prowess and the dizziness of grandeur that has descended upon the world's only and proba bly last superpower, Americans seem to have lost both the pa tience and the vision. Sadly, Brzezinski here provi des a strategic rationale for this loss. It is shortsighted nevertheless, and for the ver y reasons the author himself states so eloquently a t the beginning of his article: \"America and Europe toget her serve as the axis of global stability.\" There i s no other similar partner for an America that cares about int ernational order, prosperity and democratic progres s. And Europe, whatever its shortcomings, is a much strong er partner today than during the Cold War. It will be stronger still in the future."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" Therefore it should be America's prime interest to lay the foundations today for a partnership with the Europe of tomorrow. U.S. supremacy may last for a generati on but it will not last forever. What better use to make of this temporary advantage than to establish now the institutional framework for a partnership in which a Europe that will be stronger than it is today and an Ameri ca that will be weaker can work together for order, prosperity and democracy in tomorrow's world? That, Dr. Brzezi nski, would be imaginative realpolitik! Timothy Carton Ash, fellow of St. Antony's College, Oxford As I would always expect from Zbigniew Brzezinski, this essay is lucid, incisive, far-reaching and sti mulating. I have the problem of agreeing with most of its ana lysis and policy recommendations, especially those on NATO and EU enlargement. Let me nonetheless, as an English European, tease out five points, partly in disagreement, partly in necessary elaboration. First, I am always in favor of saying things tha t are true, even if they are politically unhelpful. The statement that Europe is a \"de facto military protectorate of the United States\" seems to me neither true nor he lpful. If I say \"Xanadu is a French protectorate,\" this is gene rally understood to mean that the French run Xanadu . The Americans do not run Europe. Even in the weaker sen se of \"being dependent for military protection\" thi s statement is scarcely true since, chaotic though Eu rope's defense arrangements are, there are no major current threats to our security against which the major Eur opean powers could not defend themselves and their EU partners. Second, it is, however, true that even the stron gest EU countries are still pathetically reliant on the United States in the case of any actual military action be yond the frontiers of the EU, even in a small patch of our own backyard such as Kosovo. I think one could usefully spell out that one major reason for this is that t he leaders of Western Europe set the wrong priorities at the e nd of the Cold War, putting the creation of a commo n currency before that of a common army. With the pre sent initiatives for improved foreign policy and de fense coordination, the EU is doing in 2000 what it shoul d have done in 1990. (I make the argument in more d etail in my new book, History of the Present.) Third, Brzezinski is absolutely right about the urgent need for the United States to be seen to be supporting, rather than carping at, these belated initiatives, especially in the defense field. The top-level poli tical message from the new administration in Washington should be entirely and emphatically positive: \"We want Europ e to have a stronger defense identity and effective rapi d reaction force.\" The supplementary stick might us efully be: \"and we now expect you to look after Kosovo yoursel ves.\" Justified reservations about NATO compatibili ty can all be explored at lower, more technical levels . Fourth, yes, Europe will never be a country. But (partly by means of introspection) I am not so pes simistic as Br/e/inski is about the possibilities of positive e motional identification with Europe. Indeed, I thin k we have mutual friends in Central Europe who could well ima gine \"dying for Europe.\" Malgre tout, Europe has a soul. There is a struggle going on for this soul. Crudely stated, this is a new version of the old argument between the Atlanticist, liberal, global free-trading orientati on, and the Gaullist, etatist, protectionist one. H istorically, the balance of advantage has been moving from the latte r to the former. Fifth, by what it does and says, the United Stat es will significantly affect this struggle, for bet ter or for worse. Neither expecting a United States of Europe, nor ac cepting a Europe as Greater Swit/.er-land, it shoul d work toward two goals best defined by one George Bush (S r.): \"partners in leadership\" and \"Europe whole and free.\" Brzezinski replies: Actually, in the main I agree with the basic points made by my friendly European critics. I do wish th at America had Europe for a genuine partner, but wishf ul thinking is not a good guide to real policymakin g. Creating a larger and gradually more integrated Eur opean space, closely allied to the United States, i s the only game in town; the alternative to it is stagnation i n the European venture, and a renewal of geopolitic al uncertainties in the area between the Euro-Atlantic zone and Russia."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE LIVING WITH RUSSIA THE PROGRESSIVE INCLUSION OF RUSSIA IN THE EXPANDING TRANSATLANTIC community is the necessary component of any long-te rm U.S. strategy to consolidate stability on the Eurasian m ega- continent. The pursuit of that goal will require pa tience and strategic persistence. There are no shortcuts on th e way. Geostrategic conditions must be created that convin ce the Russians that it is in Russia's own best interest t o become a truly democratic and European post-imperial nation- state—a state closely engaged to the transatlantic communit y. Of the major Eurasian entities (the European Uni on, Russia, China, and Japan), only Europe and Japan can be sai d to recognize fully their fundamental stake in internat ional stability. The case is somewhat more ambiguous with respect to China and Russia, which still favor more or less drastic alterations in the distribution of global power. Bu t both are also cognizant of their limitations and aware of th eir interest in cooperating with the West. China is so inclined largely because it is an ongoing economic success; Russia b ecause it is not. China thrives on foreign investment; Russia fears potential threats from its immediate south and east , and senses the diminished utility of its nuclear forces. China is self- confident; Russia is self-conscious. Hence, both Russia and China may be susceptible to a strategy aimed at their inclusion in cooperati ve international structures. To that end, two Eurasian power triangles must be steadily managed and, over time, more directly connected: one involving the United S tates, the European Union and Russia; and the other involving the United States, Japan and China.1 For that linkage to be effective, the constructive enga gement of Russia is essential. To be sure, neither America nor, even less, Euro pe can by itself seduce or transform Russia. Russia 's epiphany must come from within, much as was the cas e earlier in the twentieth century with the collaps e of the Ottoman Empire and the emergence of the modern Turk ish state. But both America and Europe can help cre ate not only a congenial but a compelling context for d esirable change. And for that reason, despite justi fiable short-term pessimism regarding the outlook of Russi a's current political leadership, there is a reason able basis for longer-term optimism. THE HISTORICAL SETTING The emergence of a democratic, Europe-oriented, pos t-imperial and national Russian state would provide historically relevant and strategically stabilizing answers to the two questions that haunt politicall y-minded Russians today: what is Russia, and where is Russia ? These questions are being posed in an environment bordering on social catastrophe and in a context of geopolitical vulnerability. One cannot underestimate the cumulative damage i nflicted on the Russian people by seventy years of communism. Russia's current condition should not be judged by the superficial glitter of Moscow or St. Petersburg, the primary beneficiaries of Western fi nancial inflows, or by occasional ups and downs in Russian growth rates. The painful reality is that the commu nist experiment has bequeathed to the Russian peopl e a ruined agriculture, a retarded and in many places p rimitive social infrastructure, a backward economy increasingly facing the risk of progressive de-indu strialization, a devastated environment, and a demographically threatened population."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" To measure precisely the cumulative effects of t hat legacy is impossible. They are both massive and enduring. Russia's current crisis coincides with the collapse of the five hundred year-old Russian Empire, which had expanded in the Soviet era into an even larger comm unist empire. The domestic crisis threatens the wel l-being of the Russian people; the imperial collapse, while posing a potential geopolitical challenge, confuse s, tempts and frustrates the country's political elite—an eli te that for decades was not only doctrinally stupef ied, but at times also lethally purged.2 That elite grew accust omed to the privileges and satisfactions of Russia' s global status, a status for which today there is no solid foundation. The last ten years have compounded rather than r esolved these challenges. Russia's relative opennes s has made the Russian people quite aware of the truly en ormous gap separating their condition from that of their West European neighbors. The increasingly widesprea d awareness that a densely populated China next doo r is also doing incomparably better is an additional sou rce of anxiety. Finally, for a state long accustome d to thinking of itself as America's principal rival, it is galling to contemplate the fact that Russia's G DP, measured in terms of purchasing power parity, is only about one-tenth of America's, roughly half of India's, an d somewhat less than Brazil's. It must also be troubling for informed Russians to learn that last year China benefited from more t han $43 billion in direct foreign investment (bringing the 1992-99 total to about $350 billion)—and that the m uch smaller post-communist Poland was the beneficiary i n 1999 alone of $8 billion in such investment—while only $2-$3 billion was directly invested from abroad in Russia during the same period (making for a meager total of $11.7 billion over 1992-99). Flagging foreign inves tment derives in part from Russia's poor internatio nal economic image. In the 1999 Global Competitiveness Report, Russia was ranked last among the 59 countri es surveyed (China was 32, Zimbabwe 57, and Ukraine 58 ). In a comparative assessment of corruption in 99 states, Russia was placed at 82 (behind Armenia). It is telling that there have been no major dome stically funded investments in Russia over the last ten years. By 1997 overall capital investment in the productio n sector had fallen to about 17 percent of the 1990 level, and only lately has risen slightly. Moreover, it has be en estimated that it would take roughly $25 trillio n over the next 25 years to renew Russia's industrial infrastr ucture, which, on average, is three limes older tha n that of ihe OECD countries. Indeed, even with sustained economi c recovery proceeding at an annual rate of 5 percen t, Russia would still account for only about 2 percent of the world's GDP by 2015. By contrast, the Unite d States and the EU together will account for approximately 45-50 percent, and Japan and China combined for pro bably another 25 percent or so. The qualitative gaps in t echnological innovation and economic competitivenes s between Russia and its western neighbors may be wid er still. The social picture is even bleaker. Some 70 mill ion Russians live in urban areas affected by levels of pollution that exceed U.S. maximum contamination le vels by a factor of five or more. About 75 percent of Russia's consumed water supply is polluted by U.S. standards. Russia's health system, long a source of pride, is malfunctioning, with many hospitals (especially in non-urbanized areas) lacking hot water and unable t o meet even minimal hygienic standards. Some 100,000 cases of tuberculosis have been registered, and only abo ut 40 percent of all recent births have resulted in fully healthy babies. According to one study, some 20 pe rcent of Russian first graders have been diagnosed with some form of mental retardation. Male life expectancy h as declined from approximately 64 years in 1990 to abo ut 59 years in 1999 (alternative data suggests the figure might be about 61 years, still very low by Western standards). The World Health Report 2000 on nationa l health systems ranked Russia's at 130, barely ahead of Sudan's. Indeed, Russia's population has dropped from 151 million in 1990 to about 146 million in 1999—with annual deaths in recent years exceeding births by slightly more than 50 percent (about 2 million deaths and 1 .3 million births per annum). While economic recovery and an i mprovement in public health programs could eventual ly slow the steep population decline, some demographic studies anticipate that Russia's population could dip below 135 million by the year 2025. Then, too, many Russians are moving out of the exposed northern an d far eastern extremities of Russia to the more secure ce ntral region west of the Urals, thereby reversing l ong- standing efforts to settle the sparsely populated n orthern and eastern peripheries. Russia, then, is confronted by a menacing combin ation of demography and geography. Its far eastern neighbor, China, not only has a population of some 1.2 billion, but an economy that in GDP terms is al ready"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"four times larger than Russia's. It is also no sour ce of geopolitical reassurance for Russia that Japa n's economy is about five times larger than its own; and that t o the west an expanding European Union is taking sh ape, with an economy already approximately ten times the size of Russia's and a population of some 375 million. Moreover, the much more prosperous Europe is allied to the United States, which has a population twice that of Russia and a GDP more than ten times as large. To the south prospects are, if anything, even mo re ominous. That area is currently organized into n ine states inhabited almost exclusively by Muslims. Their comb ined population totals about 295 million, not count ing the population of the Europe-oriented Turkey, which is about 65 million. An additional 20 million Muslims currently live within Russia's borders. At current birth rates, by the year 2025 the Islamic populatio n living immediately to the south of Russia could number as high as 450 million (not counting the projected 85 million Turks). It is probable that most of the neighboring Musl im countries will be economically weak, enhancing t he likelihood that they will also be politically volat ile. Their populations—composed in the main of the younger generation, which is restless, increasingly nationa lly self-conscious and more intensely Islamic in se lf- definition—could prove quite susceptible to extremi st appeals. Unless handled with great skill and gen uine moderation by their formerly imperial neighbor, the ir political awakening could acquire a fervent anti -Russian cast, of which the Russian mishandling of Chechnya might be only a harbinger. Much, therefore, depends on the performance of t he current Russian political elite—an elite that is strikingly different in composition and outlook from its post- communist counterparts in Central Europe. Russia's current leadership includes no former political dissidents, not even one. Moreover, in Central Europe the anti - Communist opposition—Solidarity in Poland, Sajudis in Lithuania, and Charter 77 in Prague—represented a critical mass that was subsequently capable of unde rtaking democratic reforms. In most Central Europea n states, the Communist parties also quickly converte d themselves into social-democratic ones, generally supportive of reforms and of closer ties wilh bolh NATO and the EU. In contrast, the current Russian political elite is largely an alliance of former apparatchiki, cri minalized oligarchs, and the KGB and military leadership. The ir renunciation of the Soviet past has been perfunc tory: the retention of a mausoleum in the middle of Moscow ho noring the embalmed corpse of the founder of the gu lag neatly encapsulates their mindset. Indeed, Presiden t Vladimir Putin's new team is composed of individu als who, with no exception, could now be serving in the high er echelons of the Soviet government (particularly the KGB) if the Soviet Union still existed. Putin's own political lineage is quite suggestive in that rega rd. He is a third-generation apparatchik: his father was a Part y functionary, while his grandfather even served on Lenin's and then Stalin's personal security detail. The present Kremlin leadership matured in the So viet Union's waning years. By and large, it no long er believed in the crudities of Soviet ideology, but i t relished Soviet power. The fall of the Soviet Uni on was for most of its members not only a historical shock but a calamity that could have been, and should have b een, averted. While many of them dried their tears with profits derived from the kleptocratic dismantling o f the state-owned economy, they nonetheless felt deprived by Russia's loss of international status. Putin ca ptured their pent-up feelings at his inaugural when he spo ke nostalgically of Russia as \"a great, powerful an d mighty state.\" In rebuilding a Russia \"which commands respect i n the world,\" Putin's good tactical sense dictates that outright hostility to the West is to be avoided. In deed, some accommodation with the United States is desirable, particularly in order to draw it into an anti-Islam ic alliance in the event that Russia's problems in the south spin out of control. President Clinton's easy seduction into the anti-Chechen camp, in 1995 and again in 19 99, offers a case in point. Russia's residual nuclear capabili ty also provides the basis for a special dialogue w ith the United States, thereby enhancing Russia's prestige and per haps even creating the impression of a special rela tionship.3 Russia's selective accommodation with the United States can be pursued in parallel with carefully c alibrated efforts to cultivate anti-American sentiments in We stern Europe, in order to dilute Western resolve re garding any further expansion of NATO and to exacerbate exi sting cleavages within the Euro-Atlantic community. Traditional diplomacy in dealings with Berlin and w ith Paris can also be exploited to fuel European ri valries, in"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"order to impede the emergence of a politically more integrated EU, tied to NATO, on Russia's western frontiers. In any case, a detente with the West is the sine qua non of continued Russian access to nee ded Western financial assistance. Above all, a breathing spell in relations with t he West is needed if Russia is to achieve Putin's c entral goal: the restoration of a powerful Russian state. To the present rulers, the appearance of a dozen or so ne wly independent states following the Soviet Union's col lapse is a historical aberration that should be gra dually corrected as Russia recovers its power. Although it would appear that they realize that the end result may not be a single imperial state, they seem determined to at tain the gradual subordination of the post-Soviet s tates within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent St ates in a way that limits their practical sovereign ty in the key areas of security and external economic rel ations. That aspiration is the root cause of Moscow's ve hement opposition to any Western economic presence in the space of the former Soviet Union. The Kremlin's att itude in this regard is still based on the old Leni nist zero- sum approach: it is better for the non-Russian area s not to develop economically if such development e ntails a Western presence. That is why direct access of the newly independent states to the global economy thro ugh multiple pipelines from the Caspian Sea region is v iewed by the current Russian elite with almost as m uch hostility as that shown toward Ukraine's flirtation with NATO. As one Russian Foreign Ministry officia l put it, The significant volume of funds already invested or planned by American companies for investment in Caspian oil business is defining a tendency toward a build-up of a political, and on its heels a milit ary, U.S. presence in the Caucasus. In essence, without prior consent, the incorporation of the Caspian reg ion into the sphere of 'the United States' vital intere sts' is taking place.4 Note particularly the quaint insinuation that Russi a's \"consent\" is required lor Western investment in the newly independent states. Strategically, Russian policy toward what the Kr emlin calls \"the near abroad\" has essentially three prongs. The first is to exercise pressure on both Georgia a nd Azerbaijan, increasing their vulnerability to ev entual destabilization after their current presidents depa rt from the scene. Second, Ukraine's return to some sort of a special \"Slavic\" relationship with Moscow should be encouraged, with the Russo-Belarusian \"union\" prov iding a model of the \"brotherly Slavic solidarity\" to whi ch Ukrainians should aspire. Third, pressure is to be applied to prevent the Baltic states from joining NATO, on the grounds that they were once \"legally\" a part of the Soviet Union.5 In brief, the Kremlin's current occupants believ e that the \"mighty\" Russian state should be much mo re than a national state coexisting with others within the fo rmer Soviet space. Although most members of the cur rent elite realize that economic recovery is a necessary precondition for regaining historical grandeur, so me also place special emphasis on Russia's military power a s the basis for its claim to global status. Not sur prisingly, that view is strongly held within the top Russian m ilitary leadership and was explicitly reflected in the new military doctrine adopted in December 1999. Top mil itary leaders are also particularly strong proponen ts of re- established Russian political power in a new \"Euras ian union.\"6 It would appear, therefore, that the current eli te is more preoccupied with the restoration of a do minant Russian state than with a historic reorientation of Russia. As a result, there is an obvious disconnec t between the leadership's ends and the country's means. Cont emporary Russia is simply too weak to sustain regio nal domination while nostalgically reclaiming superpowe r status. Despite numerous internal shortcomings, t he new post-Soviet states are determined to retain their i ndependence. It would take an enormous effort, far beyond Russia's present means, to subordinate them. Moreov er, it is unlikely that the West, even were it incl ined to accept some of Russia's regional aspirations as leg itimate, would remain entirely passive if the indep endence of, say, Ukraine or Georgia—not to speak of the Baltic states—was threatened. Further, Russian proponents of reliance on milit ary power greatly underestimate the economically dr aining effects of any renewed arms competition with Americ a, and overestimate the political leverage that Rus sia can exercise through its essentially one-dimensional st rategic capability. The fact is that Russia—already spending about 5 percent of its GDP on the military—cannot c ompete with the U.S.-pioneered revolution in milita ry"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"affairs. And while its nuclear weapons can serve as a deterrent, they are not an effective political t ool; their value is gradually being diminished by nuclear prol iferation, especially in Russia's immediate neighbo rhood. A Decalogue on Russia's Geopolitical Condition 1. Russia's economy is about one-tenth the size of America's, and its industrial plant is about three times older than the OECD aver age. 2. About 70 million Russians live in urban areas wi th levels of pollution 5 times higher than U.S. max imums, and about 75 percent of Russia's consumed water is contaminated. 3. Only about 40 percent of all recent births in Ru ssia have resulted in fully healthy babies. 4. Russia's population has dropped from 151 million in 1990 to 146 million in 1999. 5. Russia's immediate neighbor to the east, China, has a total population of 1.2 billion; to the west, the EU has 375 million; and to the south live pproximately 300 million Muslims. 6. China's economy is already four times larger tha n Russia's, while foreign investment in China durin g the last decade has beenthirty times higher than in Russia. The EU's economy is ten times larger than Russia's. 7. Unlike post-communist Central Europe, the curren t Russian political elite is an alliance of the KGB -military leadership with former apparatchiki and criminalize d oligarchs; all the current top Russian leaders co uld be serving in the Soviet government if the Soviet Unio n still existed. 8. The present Russian government has made it clear that its central goal is the restoration of Russia 's power and not democratic re form. 9. Russia desires an accommodation with the West in order to gain a free hand in dealing with the new states in the former Soviet space. 10. Defiance of demography and geography could embr oil Russia in conflicts menacing to its future as a major territorial state. A prolonged delay in providing realistic answers to the two questions that confront post-imperial R ussia— What is Russia? Where is Russia?—could prove calami tous. Social mobilization on the basis of nationali sm can only be a short-term remedy. Russia, underpopulated and socially deprived, could become entangled in f laming collisions with the Muslims in the south and more v ulnerable to Chinese territorial encroachments in t he east, while also antagonizing Europe (and America) to the west. An \"alliance\" with China would only subordin ate Russia to China without solving its problems. As a result, it may be only somewhat hyperbolic to suggest that the ultimate consequence of any pro longed failure to confront the full implications of Russia 's menacing geopolitical context and of the debilit ated state of its society could be the emergence not of \"a Europe to the Urals\" (as once envisaged by General de Gau lle), but eventually of a beleaguered and imploded Russia onl y to the Urals. FOR STRATEGIC DIRECTION In considering Western policy toward Russia, we wou ld do well to reflect briefly on the collapse of th e Ottoman Empire and the subsequent emergence of the Turkish national state. That experience is more per tinent to Russia's dilemmas than either Germany's and Japa n's after 1945, or Great Britain's and France's aft er they ceased to be empires. Unlike Germany and Japan, Russia was neither occ upied and subjected lo political \"re-education\" by the Cold War's victors, nor treated lo large-scale social re construction under their direct supervision. l;or m ost Russians,"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"the outcome was more ambiguous and confusing. Most at first did not feel defeated; many later felt dec eived; few were receptive to Western tutelage. Like the Russian Empire, the Ottoman Empire was territorially contiguous. Both Ottoman and Russian imperial elites drew many members from the subject nationalities. The boundaries of what was specifica lly Russian or Turkish territory were not very precise. In both cases, the empire was not a remote reality overseas but a seamless extension of the homeland itself. He nce, the sudden loss of empire was both more searin g and directly disruptive. In contrast to the efficiently repressive Soviet Russia, however, the long, slow decline of the Ott oman Empire spawned a significant minority of dissident intelle ctuals and young officers determined to model Turke y on the West European nation-states. The Young Turks, first organized in the late nineteenth century, gained i ncreasing political influence, especially in the wake of the military defeats suffered by the Ottoman rulers. So me of them at first sought to re-create a modernized version o f the old empire. But the defeat suffered in World War I prompted the next generation of reformist leaders, notably Kemal Pasha (who later became known as Atat urk), to embrace the concept of a modernized, post-imperi al state, patterned on the European nation-states. In short order, the Swiss civil code, the Italian penal code and the German commercial code were adopted, and—v ery important to note—irredentist claims, derived from the imperial past, were explicitly renounced. Three timely conclusions can be drawn from the e mergence of the modern national Turkish state: firs t, Turkey would not be contending today for membership of the European Union were it not for the fact tha t Ataturk and his bold reformers represented a critic al mass capable of effecting a psychological break with the past; second, this effort would not have endured if the West had continued to spurn Turkey; and, third , the process of historical self-redefinition is necessar ily a prolonged one, to be measured in decades, not years, and is likely to be punctuated by periodic setbacks. These conclusions contain important lessons for Russia. Although Putin displays a picture of Peter the Great in his office, his reliance on ë KGB entourage and his professed admiration for his KGB predecessor, Y uri Andropov, indicate that Putin is no Russian Ataturk . His geopolitical mindset reflects the thinking of the last Soviet generation and not of the first post-Soviet generation. Nonetheless, a new outlook is being nur tured beneath the existing political surface in the much more open conditions of post-Soviet Russia. And if only for actuarial reasons, the next generation of Russian l eaders is unlikely to be the product either of the KGB or of the apparat. That generation will come of age at a time when Russia's past imperial and global status will have become a distant memory rather than an entitlement. This ine vitably will create a different global outlook. The next generation of leaders is much more likely to includ e graduates of Western universities and businessmen with genuine international (but not criminal) exposure, sharing a more widespread desire for Russia not onl y to be like the West but to be a part of the West. Not lea st, the Russian public will increasingly demand tha t its overall lifestyle begin to match at least that of Central E urope, and that Russians not be deprived of free ac cess to the enlarging Europe next door. In short, a critical ma ss supportive of a genuine break with the past is t aking shape. To encourage that process, Western aid to Russia should be continued. But such assistance should no t be directed to the central government. Russia is wealt hy enough to be able to address its basic problems through its own resources, and Western aid has the tendency to perpetuate the worst inclinations in the current el ite. Also, since financial aid is fungible, its diversion to m ilitary programs and operations (such as those in C hechnya) is a likelihood. Instead, Western aid should concentrate on helping Russia's nascent NGOs, which promote th e emergence of a new, younger and more open-minded po litical elite—an elite that understands its own int erest in a society based on the rule of law.7 The United States should also expand its ongoing visitor programs for younger Russian political and economic aspirants. In 1999 the Library of Congress initiated a program to bring to the United States some 2,000 younger Russian local officials for visits de signed to ac-c|uain( them with the complexities of American democracy. This initiative deserves lo be enlarged tenfold, and it should be complemented by ë similar program lor the newly independent states. After World War I I, tens of thousands of young Germans and Japanese were"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"made familiar with American democracy, with an imme nsely beneficial impact. Younger Russians, especial ly from outside Moscow and St. Petersburg, should have the same opportunity. However, the reorientation of Russia's outlook w ill be delayed if Russia's current political leader ship gains the impression that its priorities can be successfully pursued, especially in the space of the former Sovi et Union. That such illusions and nostalgia tend to be self-p erpetuating makes it all the more important that We stern policy both engage Russia and drive home the need f or a basic redefinition of Russia's role in Eurasia . To facilitate Russia's historical transformation, West ern support for the consolidation of the new states —especially Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan—must be sustained. Admittedly, the necessary strategic balance will not be easy to strike. In fact, some Russian sourc es have claimed that Clinton administration officials at ti mes have encouraged Russian efforts to regain a dom inant position in the former Soviet space.\" Even the inte rnationally condemned Russian assault on Chechnya d id not produce a single noticeable U.S. response, on the g rounds that it would be contrary to the policy of \"engagement.\" It may unfortunately be the case that , during the latter phases of the Clinton administr ation, the one-sided U.S. emphasis on the West engaging Russia —but not on Russia engaging the West—could delay by some years the day when Russia comes fully to terms with its current historical condition. To hasten rather than delay that moment, the tra nsatlantic community must patiently keep the grand option of an ever widening and deepening association open to Russia, while persistently re-inforcing an environm ent that discourages any Russian efforts to turn back the ge opolitical clock. Only then may the next generation of Russian leaders—no longer the products of the Sovie t era and more likely to represent a new critical p olitical mass—draw the sole realistic conclusion to the dang ers posed by their country's internal malaise and e xternal vulnerability: namely, that in order to recover Rus sia must opt for the West. What is more, Russia mus t do so unambiguously and unconditionally, as a post-imperi al state. Russia's imperial baggage cannot be dragg ed into Europe. Russia cannot be at once imperial and Europ ean. A Decalogue of Strategic Guidelines 1. The lessons of the collapse of the Ottoman Empir e are highly relevant to Russia's contemporary dile mmas. 2. Turkey's historic self-redefinition was made pos sible by the presence of a reformist critical mass and by the West's eventual responsiveness. 3. The next generation of Russian leaders may provi de the critical mass needed for a decisive, post-im perial choice in favor of the West. 4. To that end, Western financial assistance should concentrate almost exclusively on the advancement of a new democratically-minded elite through the promotion o f grassroots democracy and expanded visitor exchang es. 5. Propitiation of Putin's regime will only delay t he desired evolution of Russia into a democratic, E urope- oriented, national Russian state. 6. Support for the newly independent states will he lp to advance the historical self-redefinition of R ussia. 7. The EU and NATO should formally propose Russia's eventual as sociation, and both the EU and NATO should explore with Russia specific initiatives to that end, including a special EU status for Kalinin grad. 8. In the meantime, both EU and NATO expansion shou ld continue, thereby eliminating any geopolitical ambiguities or temptations in the areas immediately west of Russia. 9. A transcontinental security dialogue on strategi c doctrine, build ing on a closer NATO-Russia conne ction, eventually could link the two key Eurasian security triangles. "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"10. Effective engagement cannot be pursued through one-sided courtship but only by shaping a decisive geopolitical context, in which a choice for the Wes t becomes Russia's only viable option. To prepare the ground lor ih.n hisloi ii choice, it is crucial that the West signal clearly that th e conliiuieil enlargement of the EU and of NATO does not exclude ë priori llie possibility of Russia's eventual part icipation. Although Preside-ill < llinlon gave such a signal i n his \"Charlemagne\" speech in Aachen in liinc 2000, he does not speak for the EU or even for NATO. Ë Ãïãì ť . ťť slalemcnl to that effect should be made, perhaps j ointly by both organisations. Clearly, a truly democratic Rus sia that desires to be pai I of (he West should hav e the option of becoming, in some mutually acceptable fashion, a ssociated closely with both the EU anil NAT(). The precise modalities need not be spelled out now; in fact, gi ven Russia's present condition and orientation, any effort to do so would be counterproductive. But the option sh ould be held out. In the meantime, a strategic selling favorable t o that prospect should be fostered. Steps can be ta ken to enhance gradually the role of the Euro-Atlantic Par tnership ( ëíòñ³³, which sponsors joint security pr ograms between NËÒ() slates and Partnership for Peace memb ers. While the United Slates in particular should b e alert not to fall into the trap of becoming Russia's ally against the Muslims (or the Chinese), the serious possibility of conflicts spreading like grass fire throughout Cent ral Asia might, over time, dilute Russia's hostilit y to greater Western involvement in the region. Moscow might the n view more favorably not only greater economic acc ess to the region, but also a larger role for peacekeep ing by the Organization for Security and Cooperatio n in Europe (OSCE) and eventually perhaps even by NATO. The EU's forthcoming expansion to Central Europe , even if somewhat delayed, is bound to include Pol and and eventually the Baltic states. In that context, discussions with Russia regarding a possible specia l EU status for the Kaliningrad region could prove fruitful, no t only resolving the region's persisting economic p roblems but also initiating closer EU-Russia arrangements. The same is true regarding the EU's ongoing efforts to promote Baltic regional cooperation that embrace bo th the St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad provinces of Russia. In the meantime, President Clinton's initiative in inviting Russia to join both the EU and NATO has given greater urgency to the task of enlarging both. In f act, it is altogether unrealistic to contemplate Ru ssia's inclusion in either structure without Central Europ e's full and prior inclusion. It is equally unreali stic, and even risky, to envisage delaying Central Europe's full m embership until Russia either grants its permission or itself opts for Europe. That would be tantamount to granti ng Russia an indefinite veto, with the likely effec t of stimulating the Kremlin's geopolitical aspirations regarding the Baltic states and Ukraine. The bottom line is that the consequence of any inclination to make NAT O enlargement contingent on Russia's permission is a prescription for the perpetuation of geopolitical a mbiguity on the western fringes of Russia, which wi ll impede Russia's own internal evolution. Indeed, Russia's w illingness to acquiesce to the further eastward exp ansion of NATO, particularly regarding the Baltic states, is a litmus test of the sincerity of any declared choi ce by Moscow in favor of a European and a transatlantic c onnection. Constructive initiatives toward Russia thus will only be credible if they are matched by tangible s teps toward the enlargement of both the EU and NATO. That dual enlargement is desirable in itself, and also becaus e it eliminates the risk of a possible collision between competing notions of \"europeanism\" and \"atlanticis m.\" Moreover, several European countries immediately to the west of Russia—the Baltic states especially—wa nt to be, and have the right to be, part of both the EU a nd of NATO. The next president of the United States should therefore urge our allies to move promptly on the a dmission of any democratic European state that meet s the criteria for NATO membership, even before the year 2002 (the date previously set by NATO for the consideration of further enlargement). The enlargement of NATO, in any case, has alread y proven beneficial for Europe's security, includin g Russia's. Most notably, it has made post-Cold War E urope more stable, anchoring Germany more solidly i n its middle rather than making it a \"border state,\" as s ome German leaders feared might happen after reunif ication. NATO enlargement has consolidated a sense of securi ty among the new members and promoted better relati ons between them and their non-member neighbors. It has encouraged aspirant nations to improve their treat ment of minorities and to settle their territorial disputes . It lias also stimulated closer Polish-Ukrainian c ooperation, reinforcing Ukraine's declared interest in its even tual association with the West. Last but not least, Romania and Bulgaria, because of their desire for membership, a cted decisively during the Kosovo conflict to preve nt the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"unilateral deployment of Russian paratroopers into Pristina—a deployment thai could have precipitated a risky collision between Russia and NATO.'1 The West should not be timid in affirming that R ussia's acquiescence to the expansion of the T',U a nd of NATO will hasten the day when Russia itself will be able to choose ë more comprehensive association. I ts precise form and extent will have to be negotiated, but a constructive Russian response should also pr ompt both NATO and the EU to begin a systematic review as to what kind of a shared security system, spanning \"Vancouver to Vladivostok,\" might be both feasible and desirable. The enhancement of the OSCE, and its transformation from a \"European\" to a \"Eurasian\" fr amework, could likewise become timely; and NATO its elf may eventually become a core element of a transcont inental security system.10 Given a positive Russian attitude, it may not be too early to initiate infor mal explor atory discussions regarding these longer range prospects in the con text of the NATO-Russia Joinl Council, a step that would enhance the Council's significance and also gratify Moscow. Thus, step by step, a linkage of the two critica l global security ti i angles—involving the United States, the European Union and Russia; and the United States, C hina and lapan—maybe constructed. That process may be hastened by the ongoing revolution in military tech nology, which raises the serious possibility that t he more than forty year-old reliance on mutual deterrence m ay have to be fundamentally revised in favor of som e form of strategic defense. Given that such a development bears directly on the immediate security interests of the three nuclear NATO powers, as well as of Russia and China, a comprehensive dialogue among them will become necessary beyond any bilateral U.S.-Russia d iscussions. That need will itself generate pressure s for a standing Eurasian security forum. It is important to reiterate that, while it shou ld be the policy of the UnitedjStates to engage Rus sia in an ever closer relationship with the West, such policy shou ld not be confused with one-sided courtship. Effect ive engagement should strive to create a geostrategic s etting in which the Russian elite itself comes to r ealize that Russia's only option is its best option: to become genuinely \"engaged\" to the West. It takes only a little imagination to conjure ho w beneficial it would be for Russia if one day the Kremlin startled the world by announcing that it welcomed t he enlargement of the EU and NATO to include all th ose who wished to join, and that Russia itself hopes to qualify for membership of both. Such an epiphany w ould liberate Russia from its ominous geopolitical conte xt and create favorable conditions for its acutely needed social rehabilitation. The policy of effective engagement should be del iberately designed to make that choice Russia's onl y choice. Notes 1. See chapter 1, \"Living with China,\" and cha pter 2, \"Living with a New Europe.\" 2. Few in the West fully appreciate the scope of Stalin's purge of the social elite. In one chill ing example from the Soviet archives, the NKVD's Moscow headqua rters set quotas for the number of people to be immediately arrested and shot. That quota for Mosco w in the fall of 1937 was 5,000; for Leningrad 4,00 0; for Vladivostok 2,000; for Sverdlovsk 4,000, etc. Subse quently, some of the NKVD regional offices submitt ed appeals, requesting increases in their quotas! 3. The current Russian leadership seems more s killed than its predeces sors in influencing Wester n policymakers and opinion shapers, apparently relyin g more on the KGB's intelligence apparatus, those t rained by the Soviet Institute on the U.S.A., easy access to Western centers of influence enjoyed by Russian oligarchs holding dual citizenship, and even on hired public relations firms. It stands to reason that the Russi an leaders are not in different to the outcome of U.S. preside ntial elections and may be sensitive to the West's thirst for electoral campaign funds. 4. S. I.
