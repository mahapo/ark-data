Foreward By Walter Bowart Thanks for the Memmemmormee!?1 More than 25 years h ave passed since I began research into what was the n called \"brainwashing,\" a comically euphemistic term invented in the 1950's by CIA propaganda specialis t Edward Hunter. It's been 21 years since my book on the sub ject Operation Mind Control was published internati onally, and five years since it reappeared as the greatly expan ded Limited Researcher's Edition, featuring an acco unt of \"Lois\" that offers a synopsis of the book you hold in your hands. Now it can be told. \"Lois\" is Susan Ford wh ose pseudonym is Brice Taylor. Her book Thanks for the Memories, which, by all reports is greatly anticipa ted by an audience better educated than the one I encountered in the 1970's, is now published for all the world to read. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"I wrote my book Operation Mind Control while living in Arizona, still 'a backward state, dominated by Federal funds and jobs, and the dissociated and extremely p rovincial beliefs that come with it. In the 70's mo st of the people I spoke with about what I called, generically, \"min d control\" thought I was crazy. Those who were not afraid to express their opinions on the subject believed it t o be impossible. They strongly believed they could not be made to do something against their will and without their o wn knowledge. They believed they had indomitable po wers of will, like the CIA funded psychologist, Timothy Lea ry's fellow debater and Watergate burglar, G. Gordo n Liddy. They believed, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the y could not be broken, fragmented, and mentally ens laved by any technology, even if it included hypnosis, drugs , electronic brain stimulation or what came to be c alled biological process control. My interest in this subject was piqued by a young m an, David, I had known all my life. He returned fro m a four- year tour with the United States Air Force in a con fused and deeply tormented state. You could not say that he had a destroyed mind. He suffered from complete amnesia a bout the past years of service in the USAF, but he was making straight \"A's\" in premedical courses at a pr ominent University. I did not recognize him as he sat, slumped in an ov erstuffed chair in my living room in 1973. He had u ndergone a couple of years of treatment with a competent psych iatrist and was finally asked by her, \"Do you want to know what this is and how it was cr eated, or do you just want to be able to function?\" He decided the functioning was good enough, and his treatment accelerated, taking a wide turn away fro m the historical events he remembered, which included being a \"human tape r ecorder\" and witnessing the most secret negotiations with North Vietnam and with \"Royals\" o f the Arabic persuasion who beheaded a prisoner he had just witnessed being interrogated . The image of this decapitation still haunts him i n his dreams. In 1973 the Rockefeller Commission's Report revealed that CIA Director Rich ard Helms had supposedly destroyed 153 separate fil es on a long running, top-secret project called MKULTRA, as his last act in office. In years to come many of t hose files were 1 James Joyce, Finnigan's Wake, 1938 discovere d as \"misplaced\" files. They revealed a long histor y of criminal activities by individuals who hid behind t he National Security Act and ran amok, arrogantly t reating citizens of their own country as just so many lab r ats. \"I can hypnotize a man -- without his knowledge or consent -- into committing treason against the Unit ed States ...\" -- Dr. George Estabrooks , 1943. This Canadian-born Rhodes Scholar was a hypnosis expert and former Professor at Colgate University with long- standing ties to U.S. military and domestic intelli gence, and to Martin Orne, MD, a master \"spy-chiatr ist,\" author of Patty Hearst's \"brainwashing\" defense, and founding Board member of the False Memory \"Spindrome\" Foundation . As I was researching The Rockefeller Commission's R eport, following anecdotal evidence, putting the pi eces together, then writing what turned out to be Operat ion Mind Control, I felt like the villagers in this Sufi tale: An elephant had entered a cave near a town in Morro cco and had bellowed all night, keeping the whole village awake. Nobody in the town had seen an eleph ant, nor did anyone know what an elephant looked like. The villagers held a meeting and four brave p eople among them volunteered to go into the cave to investigate what was making the strange bellowings. The first one felt the elephant's trunk and came running out to report a large python was making the noise they heard. The second one felt afoot and ca me out to report that a palm tree was making the noise . The third one felt the elephant's tail and came o ut to report that a broom, obviously controlled by a witc h, was making the noise. The fourth villager felt t he elephant's ear and came out to report that there wa s nothing to fear because a large leaf from a tropi cal plant was making the noise. Once they understood there wa s nothing to fear, the villagers went to sleep that night and didn't hear the elephant snorting and bellowing as he left the cave. Nor did they mention it again . In those days, shrinks (psychiatrists and psycholog ists) told me that what I was reporting were the re sults of a disease called \"schizophrenia.\" The word meant frag mented personality, but in time, schizophrenia turn ed out to be a familial disease, which could be treated and cont rolled with medication. The stories I was reporting took several years to understand. I eventually discovered that w hat I was reporting was the real cause of the crypt ocracy's trained"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"elephant in the particular cave next to our hometow n. I cannot tell you the experiences Sue Ford repor ts are accurate to the letter, since I was not a witness to all of them. But, as I revealed in Operation Mind Control (1994), I once saw Sue on a Palm Springs golf course in the compan y of her alleged handler, Bob Hope . At that time I was Editor- in-Chief of Palm Springs Life magazine, which had j ust won the \"Maggie\" Award for publishing the best city magazine. It was at the Bob Hope Classic that I saw Sue, but I didn't speak to her, as I was busy cove ring the happenings and celebrities, which have graced the m agazine since the 1950's. Sue was one of the Bob Ho pe Classic hostesses, assisting the public and the press in a variety of functions. My path crossed Sue's again years later when I was interviewing another survivor of mind control, but I'll spare you those details. Just read my book. I can tell you th at Sue Ford believes the story she has written with all her being, and her account as described herein has remained co nsistent. Most of her memories, conveyed in her book, she obt ained outside of the therapy setting on the Island of Kauai, while journaling on the beach, since she could not afford a therapist at that time. The perceived safe ty of the location and the steady sound of the waves in the b ackground provided her with the ability to focus in ward, allowing intense flashbacks to recur, including int ense memory of her physical sensations during those events (called body memories), all of which she was able t o write down in her journals. Sue's journals are am azingly free of mistakes, and that's no small feat since they we re written in indelible ink. One gets the impressio n that Sue simply 'downloaded' this material from her inner 'm ultiple personalities,' who were desperately wantin g to get this information out. Offering up these truths in these post-False Memory \"Spindrome\" Foundation days takes courage. The well-funded \"foundation,\" composed of alleged pedophiles and sp ychiatrists , my term for professionals who worked for the CIA in mind control projects over a period of approxima tely fifty years, has led an effective fight in the courts to establish the fact that a person can easily be made to believe things which are not true. When I asked many of those who would later sit on the FMSF Board, if a person could be made to do something against their will an d without their knowledge, they denied that it was possible i n the mid-seventies. They have not yet turned their earlier stance compl etely around. Nor have they taken the next step to offer proof that a person can be made to do something against their will and without their knowledge, but they have gon e far enough with their argument that \"justice is no longer serv ed by 'eyewitness' accounts.\" Responding to FMSF lawsuits, the State of California, I'm told, has made new laws, w hich would disqualify the testimony of anyone who h as ever confessed to having been hypnotized. Most lawyers and judges don't understand dissociati ve disorders because most \"mental health profession als\" don't understand them, and/or haven't bothered to educate the judicial branch of government. To begin to und erstand the full range of dissociative disorders, from Post-tra umatic Stress Disorder to Bipolar Disorder to the f ormer Multiple Personality Disorder (now called Dissociative Ident ity Disorder), one must confront the National Secur ity State and its military/industrial complex, which created the killers who all too often came home from their serv ice to their country to beat and sexually abuse their wives and children. One gets the impression today that the majority of both \"mental health experts\" and judges believe tha t Multiple Personality Disorder can easily be faked during exp ert examinations. However, most professionals with experience treating DID will tell you that it is almost imposs ible to fake an autonomic response, the kind of res ponse that is used to assess the reality of a dissociated state. Faking an autonomic response would be about as easy as deliberately dilating or contracting your pupils wi thout any change of light stimulus. On one case the Freedom of Thought Foundation sent me to investigate, the case of Robert Joe Moody , an alleged serial killer with a Top Secret security clearance in the USMC , I brought one of the leading experts in the treat ment of DID into the prison conference room. Within minutes this doctor had the killer manifesti ng four different personalities. When he first switched into the kill er personality the room filled with heat . The doctor told me it was not unusual for a whole variety of physical changes to occur when a multiple switched . The room quickly getting hot from the temperature change of Moody's body whe n he switched from one personality to the other is a good example of the sort of autonomic response I'm talki ng about. I'd like to see even the best-trained act or do that on cue! "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"After the interview with Moody, as we were leaving the prison, the doctor said to me, \"Well, what do you want to do? Integrate these pers onalities, or just let the little nine year-old per sonality take the punishment (death by lethal injection) for all the others, just like he has always been doing .\" In the only study of death row inmates in America, roughly 14% tested as being undiagnosed cases of DI D. Only a few prisons were used in this study. It focused onl y on convicted murderers and did not investigate vi olent criminals who were convicted of assault or crimes less than m urder. Other non-capital offenders were omitted. Th is study clearly showed the ignorance, or prejudice, of the American judicial system, one in which the diagnosi s \"malingering\" is given to people suffering from DID . Malingering is a psychiatric term that means the subject is faking an illness. The poorly trained psychologists and psychiatrists working as court appointed \"expe rt witnesses\" don't know how to test nor diagnose Dissociative Di sorders. The most tragic moment of Moody's story, for most, is when they view the police videotape of the accus ed killer being read the Miranda Warnings. Here, clearly, is the nine-year-old personality, \"Bobby,\" picking at a scab on his hand, speaking in a halting voice, not understandin g who he was, due to Amnestic Fugue, nor what the w ords in the Miranda Warnings meant. It was the only time the ac cused was read his rights. And as you might expect, Bobby wasn't the killer, nor was he even \"present\" at the scene of the crime. The killer personality was nam ed XE and was, by all present indications, created during Moody's service in the Marine Corps. \"Mental health professionals\" generally overlook th e possibility of deliberate programming. Or maybe t hat's part of the conspiracy against freedom of thought. Many shr inks are themselves unwitting accomplices in this c onspiracy. Professional expressions of denial about the access and deliberate programming of dissociated children by agents of National Security States is about as comforting as if they'd told you that the conclusions of the Warr en Commission Report were accurate and correct. Even certain memb ers of The International Society for the Study of D issociative Disorders has put DID in a separate legal category, so that, people expressing multiple personalities cannot be found \"not guilty by reason of insanity.\" Dr. Colin Ross, one of the leading experts on Disso ciative Disorders, expressed the opinion that DID m ay be the cause of most of the serious problems of our societ y, such as gangsterism, drive-by shootings, schooly ard assassinations, random acts of terrorism and all th e rest of the trauma America has been experiencing over the past few years--an idea not yet examined by criminologis ts, prison experts, and others who would supposedly protect and serve. To understand dissociation is to understand the par adigm shift in our culture—from an industrial cultu re to an information culture. To understand it is to look in to the heart of the Dissociated States of America a nd the Dissociated States of Europe and the Orient. The se eds of dissociation have been sown throughout histo ry, from our earliest recorded days until the present. You can f ind evidence of it in the first terrors of the cave men, in the shamanic practices of most primitive cultures, to t he present co-option of severely dissociated people found among the ranks of modem military recruits. A cross secti on of our society finds its way into military servi ce, and a representational number of them suffer from Dissoci ative Disorders. These form a fertile pool for recr uitment of programmed personnel. After you've met a few of them, you realize they ha ve one thing is common--they are highly suggestible . Thus it is easy to capitalize on the trauma implanted in their child's mind by daddy, uncle, a neighbor or whomev er. Once dissociation shows up in the military \"entrance tes ts,\" they are sorted out for programming. From thei r ranks are created autonomic assassins, amnestic couriers, and Mata Hari sexpionage agents who've given their inv oluntary all with no consent form requested. Who would do such a thing you ask? Read on. Learn a bout the cryptocracy that has been gradually amassi ng its power over the human mind since the days when the s wastika was forced underground, and its armbands to rn from the sleeves, but its legacy was not removed from the hearts and mind s of those welcomed to America under Project Paperclip, when Nazi war criminals, posing as scien tists, were flown from the front, hidden among thos e who had spilled their blood fighting fascism . The value of programming to the cryptocrats is un derstood when you realize its usefulness in harnessing a slave labor force and co vering up crimes. More than one forensic psychiatri st has told me that our criminal justice systems are not prepared to deal with these cases. And it's been that way fo r quite some"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"time. The litigious actions of the False Memory \"Sp indrome\" Foundation have done further damage to jus tice by successfully obfuscating the realities of Dissociat ive Disorders and by blaming its cause on the treat ments of incompetent \"mental health professionals.\" Whether a victim of DID, trained and conditioned an d honed for govemment use, claims they have been raised in a Satanic Cult, or a Secret Society, or been abducted by aliens matters not at all . For eons of time, throughout the entire history of mankind (as far as we know) war and trauma have created this evil, which is mul ti-generational, passed down the family tree from parent to child in an unbroken chain. The flavor of the torture matters not--it is none the less torture . The style of programming matters not--it is nonethe less programming . Usually the women are tumed into slaves of one kind or another; the men a re turned into killers or handlers . Regardless of the content of their story, the professional can only take it at f ace value, support the client, use it as a metaphor if nothing else, and try one technique after another until they get the results they are seeking, reintegration and eventua l recovery. After spending the past five years studying program med killers, it is refreshing to turn once again to Sue Ford's case. Most of us cannot keep from wincing at her vi vid descriptions in certain parts. Others similarly victimized have experienced tortures so terrible (literally un speakable) that they might think Sue had a \"privile ged\" time of it. Though, Sue was used at a very \"high level\" in such ways that required her physical preservation. Many survivors, it would appear, are generally too incapacitated to write their own story and too destitute or cripple d to achieve sufficient recovery. Sue's story, truly a spy-chiatrist's \"nightmare com e true,\" is like a fascinating, multifaceted gemsto ne washed up on a white, sandy Hawaiian beach after having battled typhoons, rip tides and the treacherous forces of m an and nature. It is the story of a survivor who truly has emerged as a 'Victor' against all odds. We must salute Sue. She has preceded the therapeuti c community's understanding of dissociation and rei ntegration in the context of mind control. She's been a teache r as well as a patient, and has inspired many of th ose who are leading the way toward real healing, not just a dru gging of symptoms as is too commonly found to be th e \"mental health\" cure for MPD/DID. Through her valiant recov ery from trauma-based mind control, Sue has paved t he way for other survivors to follow. Let's join her in shining the light on the path for those survivors who are ready, willing and able to stand and be counted. Their liberation will be ours--all of us! To your own Free Thinking! W.H. Bowart Director Freedom of Thought Foundation Historical Overview: Mind Control in the Modern Con text 'Mind control' is a rather vague and nebulous term used to label methods of extreme coercion that resu lt in an individual's involuntary, robotic compliance. In or der for the reader to fully understand the account presented in this book, it is essential to gain some background knowl edge about the history of mind control. There was a Special Report (article) that appeared in the US. News & World Report (January 24, 1994) e ntitled \"The Cold War Experiments,\" which provides one with an introductory and conventionally accepted perspe ctive on the subject of mind control. The article begins, st ating the widely held view that \"...U.S. government scientists, spurred on by repor ts that American prisoners of war were being brainwashed in North Korea, were proposing an urgen t, top-secret research program on behavior modification. Drugs, hypnosis, electroshock, loboto my -- all were to be studied as part of a vast U.S. effort to close the mind-control gap.\" At the time this article appeared, congressional in quiries were being held to examine new disclosures about government experiments that had intentionally expos ed American citizens to radiation. The article cont inues,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" \"But the radiation experiments are only one facet o f a vast cold war research program that used thousa nds of Americans as guinea pigs .\" And, \"From the end of World War II well into the 1970's, the Atomic Energy Commission, the Defense Department, the military se rvices, the CIA and other agencies used prisoners, drug addicts, mental patients, college students, so ldiers, even bar patrons, in a vast range of govern ment-run experiments to test the effects of everything from radiation, LSD and nerve gas to intense electric sh ocks and prolonged \"sensory deprivation .\" Note the portrayal of this activity as a \"vast\" gov ernmental effort. The article also illustrates the recent congressional concern: \"'It's not just radiation we're talking about,' say s Democratic Sen. John Glenn of Ohio, a former Marine and astronaut who is holding hearings on the subject this week. 'Any place government experimenting caused a problem we should make every effort to notify the p eople and follow up. We ought to set up some sort o f review and compensation for people who were really hurt'.\" Years later, on January 22, 1997, Sen. Glenn introd uced before Congress the Human Research Subject Pro tections Act of 1997. It was referred to the Senate Committee on Labor an d Human Resources, chaired by Sen. Arlen Spector ( author of the Warren Commission's 'single bullet th eory' ), and never made it out. With the many bare- brained pieces of legislation that make it to the S enate floor, you would think that one which attempt s to safeguard human subjects of experimentation would be a 'no-br ainer,' but apparently it is not with this Congress . Parallel with this activity, President Clinton publ ished an Administrative Order known as Memorandum o f March 27, 1997 entitled \" Strengthened Protections for Human Subjects of Clas sified Research \" (see appendix), which attempted to implement the recommendations of the A dvisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, w hich he established in January 1994. To date, these well -intended efforts have had little or no impact. Last year (April 15, 1998), Harlan Girard, on behal f of the International Committee for the Convention Against Offensive Microwave Weapons, brought suit against t he Federal government for its non-compliance in car rying out President Clinton's Administrative Order. This case is still in the process of working its way through the Federal courts. The U.S. News & World Report article conclu des with the following paragraph: \" Another former CIA official, Sidney Gottlieb , who directed the MKULTRA behavior-control program almost from its inception , refused to discuss his work when US. News reporter visited him last week at hi s home. He said the CIA was only trying to encourage basic work in behavior science. But he added that a fter his retirement in 1973, he went back to school, pra cticed for 19 years as a speech pathologist and now works with AIDS and cancer patients at a hospice. He said he has devoted the years since he left the CIA 'trying to get on the side of the angels instead of the devils' .\" Gottlieb's praiseworthy activities since 1973 speak to the seriousness of what he had participated in prior to that date, under Project MKULTRA. He was one individual who at least tried to do something to 'save his sou l,' which is more than one can say for the host of others who we re similarly involved. Gottlieb passed away earlier in 1999, just in time to miss all the 'fireworks.' The following article, \" Project Monarch: Nazi Mind Control \" by Ron Patton , provides an excellent historical overview on mind control in its many different aspe cts and is reprinted here almost in its entirety. T he article appeared in the trend-setting, alternative press ma gazine Paranoia: The Conspiracy Reader in the Fall 1996 issue. This magazine, one of several 'iconoclasts,' has pu blished a number of such informative articles on re lated subjects and, to date, appears to be the leading source for news and information about mind control. Note: The actual name of a classified project known to many as 'Monarch' is yet to be officially confi rmed, therefore, the reader is advised to substitute the phrase \"traumabased mind control\" for the author's usage of the code name \"MONARCH.\" "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"PROJECT MONARCH: NAZI MIND CONTROL by Ron Patton Amidst the subtle cerebral circumvention of the gul lible populace, through a multitude of manipulated mediums, lies one of the most diabolical atrocities perpetra ted upon a segment of the human race: a form of sys tematic mind control which has permeated every aspect of society for almost fifty years. To objectively ascertain the following, one may nee d to re-examine preconceived ideologies relating to the dualistic nature of mankind. Resolving the philosophical ques tion of whether we are inherently good or inherentl y evil is tantamount in shaping our perception of reality; sp ecifically, the spiritual variable within the equat ion of life. This exposition is substantiated by declassified U. S. Government documents, individuals formerly conne cted to the U.S. intelligence communities, historical researche rs knowledgeable in mind control, publications from mental health practitioners, and interviews taken from sur vivors unwittingly subjected to a highly complex fo rm of traumabased mind control known as MONARCH programmi ng. A word of caution for survivors of intensively syst ematic mind control and/or some form of ritualized abuse: There are numerous \"triggers\" in this article. It is ther efore recommended not to read it unless appropriate support systems are in place or if you have a thoroughly reintegrat ed personality. A Brief History of Control The Mystery Religions of ancient Egypt, Greece, Ind ia and Babylon helped lay the foundation for occult ism, meaning \"hidden knowledge .\" One of the earliest writings giving reference to occultism is the Egyptian Book of the Dead, a compilation of rituals explicitly describing met hods of torture and intimidation (to create trauma) , the use of potions (drugs) and the casting of spells (h ypnotism), ultimately resulting in the total enslav ement of the initiate.[1] These have been the main ingredients for a part of occultism known as Satanism, throughout the ages. During the 13th Century, the Roman Catholic Church increased and solidified its dominion throughout Eu rope with the infamous Inquisition. Satanism survived this pe riod of persecution, deeply entrenching itself unde r the veil of various esoteric groups. In 1776, a Bavarian Jesuit by the name of Adam Weishaupt was commissioned by the House of Rothschild to centralize the power base of the Mystery Religio ns into what is commonly known as the Illuminati , meaning \"Enlightened Ones.\" This was an amalgamatio n of powerful occultic bloodlines, elite secret societies and influential Masonic fraternities, wit h the desire to construct the framework for a \" New World Order .\" The outward goal of this Utopia was to bring forth universal happiness to the human race. However, the ir underlying intention was to gradually increase cont rol over the masses, thus becoming masters of the p lanet. The Anglo Alliance By the 19th century, Great Britain and Germany were recognized as the primary geographic areas of Illu minati control. It then should be of little surprise to know the first work in Behavioral Science research was established in England in 1882, while much of the early medical an d psychiatric techniques involved in mind control w ere pioneered at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany . The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations was set up in London in 1921 to study the \"breaking point\" of humans . Kurt Lewin, a German psychologist, became the dir ector of the Tavistock Institute in 1932, about the same time Nazi Germany was increasing its research into neuropsychology, parapsychology and multi-generatio nal occultism. Interestingly, a progressive exchange of scientific ideas was taking place between England and Germany , most notably in the field of eugenics: the movement devo ted to \"improving\" the human species through the co ntrol of hereditary factors in mating. The nefariously enigmatic union between the two cou ntries was bonded, partly through the Order of the Golden Dawn , a secret society, which consisted of many high-ra nking officials in the Nazi party and British aristocracy . Top SS Nazi officer, Heinrich Himmler , was in charge of a scientific project called"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Lebensborn , which included selective breeding and adoption of children, a peculiarly large number of twins among them.[2] The purpose of the program was to create a super-ra ce (Aryans) who would have total allegiance to the cause of the Third Reich (New Order). Much of the preliminary experimentation concerning genetic engineering and behavior modification was conducted by Dr. Josef Mengele at Aushwitz, where he coldly analyzed the effects of trauma-bonding, eye-coloring and \"twinning\" upon his victims. Besides the insidious surgical experimentation perf ormed at the concentration camp, some of the children were subjected to massive amounts of electroshock . Sadly, many of them did not survive the brutality . Concurrently, \" brain-washing\" was carried out on inmates at Dachau , who were placed under hypnosis and given the hallucinogenic drug mescaline . During the war, parallel behavioral research was led by Dr. George Estabrooks of Colgate University . His involvement with the Army, CID, FBI and other agencies remains shrouded in secrecy. However, Estabrooks would occasionally \"slip\" and d iscuss his work involving the creation of hypno-pro grammed couriers and hypnotically-induced split personaliti es.[3] After WWII, the U.S. Department of Defense secretly imported many of the top German Nazi and Italian F ascist scientists and spies into the United States via Sou th America and the Vatican. The code name for this operation was Project PAPERCLIP .[4] One of the more prominent finds for the U.S. was Ge rman General Reinhard Gehlen , Hitler's Chief of Intelligence against Russia . Upon arriving in Washington, DC in 1945, Gehlen m et extensively with President Truman, General William \"Wild Bill\" Donovan, Director of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and Allen Dulles, who would later become the stalwart head of the CIA. The objective of their brainstorming sessions was to reorganize t he nominal American intelligence operation, transforming it in to a highly efficient covert organization. The culmination of their efforts produced the Central Intelligence Group in 1946, renamed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1947 . Reinhard Gehlen also had profound influence in helping to create th e National Security Council , from which the National Security Act of 1947 was derived. This par ticular piece of legislation was implemented to pro tect an unconscionable number of illegal government activit ies, including clandestine mind control programs. Evolution of Project MKULTRA With the CIA and National Security Council firmly e stablished, the first in a series of covert brainwa shing programs was initiated by the Navy in the fall of 1947. Project CHATTER was developed in response to the Soviet's \"successes\" through the use of \"truth drugs. \" This rationale, however, was simply a cover story if the program were to be exposed. The research focused on the identifi cation and testing of such drugs for use in interro gations and the recruitment of agents.[5] The project was officially terminated in 1953 . The CIA decided to expand their efforts in the area of behavior modification, with the advent of Project BLUEBIRD , approved by Director Allen Dulles in 1950 . Its objectives were to: (1) Discover a means of conditioning personnel to prevent unauthorized extraction of information from them by known means, (2) Investigate the possibility of control of an individual by application of special interrogation techniques , (3) Investigate memory enhancement and (4) Establish defensive means for preventing hostil e control of agency personnel. In August 1951 , Project BLUEBIRD was renamed Project ARTICHOKE , which evaluated offensive uses of interrogation techniques, including hypnosis and dr ugs. The program ceased in 1956 . Three years prior to the halt of Project ARTICHOKE, Project MKULTRA came into existence on April 13, 1953 along the lines proposed by Richard Helms, Deputy Director of Central Intellige nce CDCI with the rationale of establishing a \"spec ial funding mechanism of extreme sensitivity.\"[6] The hypothetical etymology of \" MK\" may possibly stand for \"Mind Kontrolle .\" The obvious postwar translation of the German word, \"Kontrolle\" into English is \"contr ol.\"[7] "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"A host of German doctors, procured from the Nazi ta lent pool, were an invaluable asset toward the deve lopment of MKULTRA. The correlation between the concentration camp experiments and the numerous sub-projects of MKULTRA are clearly evident. The various avenues us ed to control human behavior under MKULTRA included radiation, electroshock, psychology, psychiatry, so ciology, anthropology, graphology, harassment subst ances and paramilitary devices and materials (LSD being the m ost widely dispensed \"material\"). A special procedu re, designated MKDELTA , was established to govern the use of MKULTRA abroad . MKULTRA / MKDELTA materials were used for harassment, discrediting or disabling purposes.[8] Of the 149 subprojects under the umbrella of MKULTR A having been identified, Project MONARCH officially began by the U.S. Army in the early 1960's (althoug h unofficially implemented much earlier) appears to be the most prominent and is still classified as TOP SECRET for \"National Security\" reasons.[9] MONARCH may have culminated from MKSEARCH subprojects, such as operation SPELLBINDER , which was set up to create \"sleeper\" assassins (i.e. \"Manchurian Candidates\") who could be activa ted upon receiving a key word or phrase while in a post-hypnotic trance. Operation OFTEN , a study which attempted to harness the power of occ ultic forces , was possibly one of several cover programs to hid e the insidious reality of Project MONARCH. Definition and Description The name MONARCH is not necessarily defined within the context of royal nobility, but rather refers to the Monarch butterfly. When a person is undergoing trau ma induced by electroshock, a feeling of light-head edness is evidenced; as if one is floating or fluttering like a butterfly. There is also a symbolic representati on pertaining to the transformation or metamorphosis of this beautiful i nsect: from a caterpillar to a cocoon (dormancy; in activity), to a butterfly (new creation) which will return to its p oint of origin. Such is the migratory pattern that makes this species unique. Occultic symbolism may give additional insight into the true meaning. Psyche is the word for both \"sou l\" and \"butterfly,\" coming from the belief that human soul s become butterflies while searching for a new reincarnation.[10] Some ancient mystical groups, such as the Gnostics, saw the butterfly as a symbol of corrupt flesh . The \"Angel of Death\" (remember Mengele?) in Gnostic art works was portrayed crushing the butterfly.[11] A marionette is a puppet that is attached to strings and is controlle d by the puppet master, hence MONARCH programming i s also referred to as the \"Marionette Syndrome.\" \"Imperial Conditioning\" is another term used, while some men tal health therapists know it as \"Conditioned Stimulus-Respons e Sequences.\" Project MONARCH could be best described as a form o f trauma-structured dissociation and occultic integ ration in order to compartmentalize the mind into multiple pe rsonalities within a systematic framework. During the process, a Satanic ritual, usually including Cabalistic mystic ism, is performed with the purpose of attaching a p articular demon or group of demons to the corresponding alter(s) . Of course, most [people] would view this as simpl y a means to enhance trauma within the victim negating irrationa l belief that demonic possession actually occurs. Alters and Triggers Another way of examining this convoluted victimizat ion of body and soul is by looking at it as a compl ex computer program: A file (alter) is created through trauma, repetition and reinforcement. In order to activate (trigger) the file, a specific access code or password (cue or command) is required. The victim survivor is called a \"slav e\" by the programmer/handler, who in turn is perceived as \"ma ster\" or \"god.\" About 75% are female, since they possess a higher tolerance for pain and tend to dissociate ea sier than males . Subjects are used mainly for covert operations, prostitution and pornography; involvement in the en tertainment industry is notable . A former military officer connected to the DIA told this writer, \"In the 'big picture' these people [MONARCH victims ] are in all walks of life, from the bum on the str eet to the white-collar guy .\" "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"In corroboration, a retired CIA agent vaguely discu ssed the use of such personnel to be used as \"plant s\" or \"chameleons\" for the purpose of infiltrating a desi gnated group, gathering information and/or injectin g an ulterior agenda. There are an inordinate amount of alters in the vic tim/survivor, with numerous back-up programs, mirro rs and shadows. A division of light-side (good) and dark-s ide (bad) alters are interwoven in the mind and rot ate on an axis. One of the main internal structures, (of which ther e are many) within the system is shaped like a doub le-helix, consisting of seven levels. Each system has an inte rnal programmer who oversees the \"gatekeepers\" (dem ons?) who grant or deny entry into the different rooms. A few of the internal images predominately seen by victi ms/survivors are trees, the Cabalistic \"Tree of Life,\" with adjo ining root systems, infinity loops, ancient symbols and letters, spider webs, mirrors or glass shattering, masks, ca stles, mazes, demons/monsters/aliens, sea shells, b utterflies, snakes, ribbons, bows, flowers, hour glasses, clock s, robots, chain-of-command diagrams and/or schemat ics of computer circuitry boards. Bloodlines and Twinning A majority of the victims/survivors come from multi -generational Satanic families (bloodlines) and are ostensibly programmed \"to fulfill their destiny as the chosen ones or chosen generations \" (a term coined by Mengele at Auschwitz). Some are adopted out to families of sim ilar origin. Others used in this neurological night mare are deemed as the \" expendable ones\" (non-bloodliners), usually coming from orphanages, foster-care homes, or incestuous families with a long history of pedophil ia . There also appears to be a pattern of family memb ers affiliated with government or military intelligence agencies. Many of the abused come from families who use Catho licism, Mormonism, or charismatic Christianity as a \"front\" for their abominable activities (though members of other religious groups are also involved.) Victims/ survivors generally respond more readily to a rigid religious (dogmatic, legalistic) hierarchical structure beca use it parallels their base programming. Authority usually goes unch allenged, as their will has been usurped through su bjective and command-oriented conditioning. Physical identification characteristics on victims/ survivors often include multiple electrical prod sc ars and/or resultant moles on their skin. A few may have had v arious parts of their bodies mutilated by knives, b randing irons, or needles. Butterfly or occult tattoos are also co mmon. Generally , bloodliners are less likely to have the subsequen t markings, as their skin is to \"remain pure and unbl emished.\" The ultimate purpose of the sophisticated manipulat ion of these individuals may sound unrealistic, dep ending upon our interpretive understanding of the physical and spiritual realms. The deepest and darkest alters wi thin bloodliners are purported to be dormant until the \" AntiChrist \" is revealed. These \"New World Order\" alters suppo sedly contain call-back orders and instructions to train and/or i nitiate a large influx of people (possibly clones o r \"soulless ones\") thereby stimulating social control programs into th e new millennium. Non-biological \"twinning\" is yet another bizarre fe ature observed within MONARCH programming . For instance, two young non-related children would be ceremonious ly initiated in a magical \"soul-bonding\" ritual so they might be \"inseparably paired for eternity\" (possibly anot her Mengele connection?). They essentially share tw o halves of the programmed information, making them interdepend ent upon one another. Paranormal phenomenon such as astral projection, te lepathy, ESP, etc. appear to be more pronounced bet ween those who have undergone this process. Levels of MONARCH Programming [12] ALPHA . Regarded as \" general\" or regular programming within the base control personality; characterized by extremely pronounced memory retention , along with substantially increased physical strength and visual acuity. Alpha programming is accomplished through deliberat ely subdividing the victim's personality which, in essence, causes a left brain - right brain division; allowin g for a programmed union of L and R through neuron pathway stimulation."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" BETA. Referred to as \" sexual\" programming . This programming eliminates all learned moral con victions and stimulates the primitive sexual instincts, devoid o f inhibitions. \"Cat\" alters may come out at this le vel. DELTA. This is known as \"killer\" programming , originally developed for training special agents or elite soldiers (i.e. Delta Force, First Earth Battalion, Mossad, e tc.) in covert operations. Optimal adrenal output a nd controlled aggression is evident. Subjects are devoid of fear; very systematic in carrying out their assignment. Self-destruct or suicide instructions are layered in at this level. THETA . Considered to be \" psychic\" programming . Bloodliners (those coming from multigenerational Satanic families) were determined to exhibit a greater prop ensity for having telepathic abilities than did non-bloodliners. Due to its evident limitations, however, various fo rms of electronic mind control systems were develop ed and introduced, namely, biomedical human telemetry devi ces ( brain implants ), directed energy lasers using microwaves and/or electromagnetics. It is reported these are u sed in conjunction with highly-advanced computers a nd sophisticated satellite tracking systems. OMEGA . A \" self-destruct\" form of programming , also known as \"Code Green .\" The corresponding behaviors include suicidal tendencies and/or self-mutilation. This program is generally activated when the victi m/survivor begins therapy or interrogation and too much memory is being recovered. GAMMA . Another form of system protection is through \" deception\" programming , which elicits misinformation and misdirection. This level is intertwined with demonology and tends to regenerate itself at a later time if inappropriately deactivated. Methods and Components The initial process begins with creating dissociati on within the subject, usually occurring from the t ime of birth to about six years. This is primarily achieved through the use of electroshock (ECT) and is at times performed even when the child is in the mother's womb . Due to the severe trauma induced through ECT, sexual abuse and other methods, the mind splits off into alternate personalities from t he core . Formerly referred to as Multiple Personality Disorder, it is presently recognized as Dissociativ e Identity Disorder and is the basis for MONARCH pr ogramming. Further conditioning of the victim's mind is enhanc ed through hypnotism, double-bind coercion, pleasure-pain reversals, food, water, sleep and sensory deprivati on , along with various drugs, which alter certain cerebral functions . The next stage is to embed and compress detailed commands or messages within the specified alter. This is achieved through the use of hi-tech headsets , in conjunction with computer-driven generators, whi ch emit inaudible sound waves, or harmonics that affect the RNA cover ing of neuron pathways to the subconscious and unco nscious mind . \" Virtual Reality\" optical devices are sometimes used simultaneously with the harmoni c generators projecting pulsating colored lights, subliminals and split-scr een visuals . High voltage electroshock is then used for memory dissolution . Programming is updated periodically and reinforced through visual, auditory and written mediums. Some of the first programming themes included the Wizard of Oz and Al ice and Wonderland, both heavily saturated with occ ultic symbolism. Many of the recent Disney movies and cartoons are u sed in a two-fold manner : desensitizing the majority of the population, using subliminals and neuro-linguistic programming , and deliberately constructing specific triggers and keys for base programming of highly impressionable MONARCH children. [Paragraphs omitted in original] Music plays an instrumental role in programming, th rough combinations of variable tones, rhythms and w ords. Frightmeister Stephen King's numerous novels and subsequent movies, are purport ed by credible sources to be used for such villainous purposes.

Mengele's direct involvement at the infamous Aushwi tz concentration camp was suspiciously downplayed d uring the Nuremberg Trials, and consequently no intensifi ed effort by the U.S. and its allies was directed t oward his capture.[13] As a means to confuse serious investigators as to h is whereabouts, U.S. officials would report Mengele being a non- threatening recluse in Paraguay or Brazil, or that he was simply dead (the \"Angel of Death\" miraculous ly must have come back to life at least five different times). H is unprecedented research, at the expense of thousa nds of lives, undoubtedly was a significant bonus to U.S. interes ts. Besides using the pseudonym of Dr. Green, survi vors knew him as Vaterchen (daddy), Schoner Josef (beautiful Joseph), David and Fairchild . A gracefully handsome man of slight stature, Mengele would disarm people with hi s gentle demeanor, while at other times, he would e xplode into violent rages. [14] Other characteristics remembered by survivors were the cadence of his shiny black boots as he paced ba ck and forth and his \"I-love-you/I-love-you-not\" daisy game. Whe n he pulled off the last daisy petal, he would mali ciously torture and kill a small child in front of the othe r child he was programming. Distraught survivors al so recalled being thrown naked into cages with monkeys, who wer e trained to viciously abuse them. Evidently, Menge le enjoyed reducing people to the level of animals. He also would purposely restrain his victims from cry ing, screaming, or showing any excessive emotion. Dr. D. Ewen Cameron , also known as Dr. White , was the former head of the Canadian, American and W orld Psychiatric Associations . Because of Cameron's extensive experience and cre dentials, the CIA's Allen Dulles funneled millions of dollars through front organiza tions like the Society for the Investigation of Hum an Ecology, which Cameron ruthlessly presided over. Experimenta tions were conducted at several locations in Montre al, mostly at McGill University, St. Mary's Hospital and Allan Memorial Institute. Besides the conventional methods of psychiatric tyr anny, such as electroshock, drug injections and lob otomies, Cameron conceived the technique of \"psychic driving ,\" wherein unsuspecting patients were kept in a dru g-induced coma for several weeks and administered a regimen o f electroshocks, while electronic helmets were stra pped to their heads and repetitive auditory messages were t ransmitted at variable speeds.[15] Many of those ex ploited were abused children who had been run through the Roman Catholic orphanage system. Not surprisingly, Dr. Cameron has been conveniently left out of most psychiatric journals. This may ha ve been, in fact, largely due to Project MKULTRA being publicly exposed in 1970, through lawsuits filed by Canadia n survivors and their families. The CIA and Canadian government settled out of court so as not to be req uired to officially admit to any wrongdoing. A former U.S. Army Lt. Col. in the DIA's Psychologi cal Warfare Division, Michael Aquino , is the latest in a line of alleged government-sponsored sadists. Aquino, an eccentric genius, founded the Temple of Set , an offshoot of Anton LaVey's Church of Satan . His obsession with Nazi pagan rituals and his hyp notic manipulation of people"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"made him an ideal candidate for the position of \"Ma ster Programmer.\" Aquino was connected with the Pre sidio Army Base daycare scandal, in which he was accused of child molestation. Much to the dismay of the you ng victims' parents, all charges were dismissed. [Sent ence omitted] Heinrich Mueller was another important programmer who went under th e code names \" Dr. Blue\" or \"Gog .\" He apparently has two sons who have carried on the tra de. The original \"Dr. Black\" was apparently Leo Wheeler , the nephew of deceased General Earle G. Wheeler , who was the commander of the Joint Chiefs of Staf f during the Vietnam War.

In order to keep MKULTRA from being easily detected , the CIA segmented its subprojects into specialize d fields of research and development at universities, prison s, private laboratories and hospitals. Of course, t hey were rewarded generously with government grants and misc ellaneous funding.

Notable Names One of the first documented cases of a MONARCH secr et agent, was that of the voluptuous 1940's model, Candy Jones . The book, The Control of Candy Jones , (Playboy Press) portrays her 12 years of intrigue and suspense as a spy for the CIA. Jones, whose birth name is Jessica Wilcox, apparently fit the physiological profile a s to be one of the initial experiments or human guinea pigs under the government's \"scientific\" project, MKULTRA. The most publicized case of MONARCH monomania has s urfaced through the book TRANCE Formation of America : The True Life Story of a CIA Slave by Cathy O'Brien . On the back cover it emphatically states, \"Cathy O'Brien is the only vocal and recovered surv ivor of the Central Intelligence Agency's Mk-Ultra Project Monarch mind control operation.\" This documented autobiography contains compelling a ccounts of O'Brien's years of unrelenting incest an d eventual introduction into Project MONARCH by her perverted father. Along with co-author Mark Phillips, her res cuer and deprogrammer, Cathy covers an almost unbelievable a rray of conspiratorial crime: forced prostitution ( white slavery) with those in the upper echelons of world politics, covert assignments as a \"drug mule\" and c ourier, and the country-western music industry's relationship with illegal CIA activities.

Hammond alluded to the Nazi connection, military an d CIA mind control research, Greek letter and color programming and specifically mentioned the \"Monarch Project\" in relation to a form of [operant] condit ioning. Shortly after his groundbreaking speech, he receive d death threats. Not wanting to jeopardize the safe ty of his family, Dr. Hammond stopped disseminating any follo w-up information, until recently. [Paragraph omitted in original] New Orleans therapist Valerie Wolf introduced two of her patients before the Presiden t's Committee on Human Radiation Experiments on March 15, 1995 in Washingt on, DC. The astonishing testimony made by these two brave women included accounts of German doctors, torture, drugs, electroshock, hypnosis and rape, besides be ing exposed to an undetermined amount of radiation. Bot h Wolf and her patients stated they recovered the m emories of this abuse, without regression or hypnosis techniqu es. [19] Wolf presently devotes much of her time to counseli ng such survivors. A former labor attorney for Atla ntic Richfield Co., David E. Rosenbaum , conducted a nine-year investigation (1983-1992) concerning allegations of physical torture and coercive conditioning of numer ous employees at an ARCO plant in Monaca, PA.[20] His clients, Jerry L. Dotey and Ann White, were vic tims of apparent radiation exposure; but as Mr. Ros enbaum probed deeper in the subsequent interview sessions, a \"Pandora's Box\" was unveiled. His most astonishing conclusion was that Jerry Dotey and Ann White were likely the offspring of Adolf Hitler, based in part on the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"uncanny resemblance from photos (facial features, bone structure and size were tak en into consideration). Rosenbaum also states, \" They both exhibit feelings and experiences that ind icate they are twins.\" Dotey and White were allegedly subjected to torture of many kinds while under drug-induced hypnosis, w ith each one undergoing at least three training techniques b y plant physicians. Each victim was trained to enter into a hypnotic state upon the occurrence of specific stim uli, usually involving a \"cue\" word or phrase and t rained to \"remember to forget\" what transpired in the hypnoti c state . They were repeatedly subjected to identical stimu lus- response sequences to produce nearly automatic reac tions to the particular status. MKULTRA veterans Dr. Bernard Diamond, Dr. Martin Orne and Dr. Josef Meng ele regularly visited the ARCO plant, according to Rosenbaum . The special conditioning of Dotey and White was i ntended for the artificial creation of dual German personalities. Rosenbaum, who is Jewish, has mainta ined a deep friendship with the two, despite the se emingly precarious circumstances. Other renowned therapists involved in deprogramming are Cynthia Byrtus, Pamela Monday, Steve Ogilvie, Bennett Braun, Jerry Mungadze and Colin Ross. Some Christia n counselors have been able to eliminate parts of t he programming with limited success. Journalists who h ave recently expounded on the subject matter in exe mplary fashion are Walter Bowart : Operation Mind Control, Jon Rappoport: US. Government Mind-Control Experiments on Children, and Alex Constantine: Psychic Dictatorship in the USA [and Virtual Gover nment, plus author/researchers Alan Scheflin & Edward Opton, Jr .: The Mind Manipulators, Harvey Weinstein, M.D.: Psychiatry and the CIA: Victims of Mind Control, an d Jim Keith : Mind Control, World Control and his latest book Mass Control: Engineering Human Consciousness.] Conclusion The most incriminating statement to date made by a government official as to the possible existence of Project MONARCH was extracted by Anton Chaitkin, a writer f or the publication, The New Federalist. When former CIA Director William Colby was asked directly, \"What ab out monarch?\" he replied angrily and ambiguously, \" We stopped that between the late 1960's and the early 1970's.\" Suffice to say that society, in its appare nt state of cognitive dissonance, is generally in denial of the overwhelming evidence of this multifarious conspir acy. Numerous victims/survivors of Project MONARCH are i n desperate need of help. However, the great majori ty of people are too preoccupied with themselves to show any genuine compassion toward these severely wounde d individuals. Apathy has taken over the minds of the masses, who choose to exist within the comforts of this world. Reality has thus become obscured by relativism and selfishness. Although there has been some progress in deprogram ming and reintegrating therapies, a much greater problem nee ds to be rectified. The Holy Bible addresses this p roblem as the fragmentation of the soul (Ezekiel 13:20). A spirit ual restoration is what is truly needed (Psalm 23:3 ) ... [Sentence omitted] [Paragraph omitted in original] Statistically, the road to recovery for these survi vors of unimaginable depravity is a long and tediou s one, but God is the ultimate healer and only within his time, throu gh His strength and by His grace, can the captives be set free (Isaiah 61:1).

Monday, Ph.D. MANUFACTURING THE MIND CONTROLLED SLAVE \"If the child has survived the initial trials, and if they also prove intelligent but malleable, then if the programming goes right , a very, very small infant that has been conditioned from day one is a powerful weapon , because if you get a mind that early, as anyone k nows, you can, 9 times out of 10, I would say, determine the general behaviors of that child and t he adult that they will become.\" -- Gloria \"-- A former patient, and mind control subject My first experience with a patient who had been inv olved in mind control experimentation began when \"G loria\" initially called me, looking for a therapist who ac cepted Medicare insurance. She said she had been se xually abused as a child and had been in therapy periodically for a number of years. I was not a Medicare provider, but agreed to see her temporarily while she looked for someone el se. On the day of our first appointment, I walked i nto the waiting room to greet her and asked for \"Gloria.\" A woman looked up from a corner, and slowly, shyly, with head lowered and eyes looking up, shuffled to ward me. In a child-like voice, she held both of hands toget her tightly, hunched her shoulders and said, with a sweet smile, \"Gloria asked me to come; I'm Sally.\" She then twir led on her toes and pointed to a plant on the table , saying again in a child-like voice, \"That sure is pretty!\" Puzzl ed, I smiled and asked her to follow me to my offic e. During the course of that one hour, 4 different personalities, with different ages and genders, presented themsel ves to me . We would be talking about some topic, and suddenly, a switch would occur, and someone else's voice, manne risms, and way of sitting and speaking would present . It was as though 4 different people were in my ro om, although all were housed in the same body! Although I had heard of Mu ltiple Personality Disorder, or MPD, before, I had never seen it, and had been told in graduate school that it wa s very rare. I remember thinking after Gloria left, that if she were faking it (as patients are often accused of doing b y clinicians who don't understand) she would have t o have the mimicking abilities of a Billy Crystal, and the act ing abilities of a Meryl Streep, to consistently st ay in character for each of these personalities! For, before we were through, I had met 27 'inside p eople' (also referred to as alters) within Gloria, and learned about the names and role s of literally hundreds more! "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Since that introduction to MPD (now known as DID, o r Dissociative Identity Disorder), I have worked wi th dozens of patients with that diagnosis, and have consulted with other clinicians and their patients so often, I have lost count. These patients have taught me so very much about th e human mind, and have challenged me to learn about topics I have never thought to explore. In my efforts to con vince myself, \" surely what these people are saying cannot be true ,\" I have researched and studied both scientific an d popular literature in a variety of fields, and ha ve time and again, come to the conclusion that what they are reporting could, indeed, be true . The historical background, technology, methodology, motivation, funding, and o pportunity are all in place. My task now is to help others understand and believe. I'd like to define some terms that you will hear wh en learning about people with \"multiple personaliti es.\" Dissociation is a key term that refers to the abili ty of the mind to \"cut off\" a part of itself from c onscious awareness. An everyday example of this ability, which we all h ave in varying degrees, is the experience of drivin g down the freeway and missing the exit you take everyday beca use you are thinking about something else. You \"com e to\" an exit or two later and realize you have missed your exit, even noticing that you \"saw\" the exit sign bu t it didn't \"register\" within you to take it! Part of your mind was dissociated, or separated from, the real world around you while you focused on internal thoughts. Another exa mple is reading every word on a page in a book, the n realizing you had not comprehended a single word, because you were thinking of something else. All of us have ha d these experiences. This ability of the mind to detach from itself is a brilliant coping mechanism that the mind uses in s ituations of extreme threat as a way to protect itself from the full awareness of a traumatic situation. You may re call reading about Vietnam veterans, who had amnesia for their w ar experiences, but would have difficulty coping wi th life. They would feel detached or estranged from others; they would have difficulty feeling any kind of feel ings, except for outbursts of anger; they would have difficulty concentrating, would feel anxious and on edge witho ut knowing why, and would have an exaggerated startle response (over-responsive to stimuli). These are all charac teristics of the diagnosis \"Post Traumatic Stress Disorder\" or P TSD. In addition, these veterans would have sudden memories of the horrors of war. These memories would be \"tri ggered\" by something that reminded their unconsciou s mind of the war experience (for example, the sound of a car backfiring, reminding them of gunfire). In these s udden memories, they felt as if they were actually re-liv ing the experience, smelling, tasting, feeling, hea ring and seeing in vivid detail everything they went through during an actual battle. These memories, complete with all t he sensory memories, are called flashbacks. During those flash backs, the veteran would be out of touch with the r eality around them; they would no longer know it was 1985 and the y were in America; they would think it was 1968, an d they were in the jungle, reliving a particular battle. T hey were totally dissociated from reality, and were reliving a past reality that was now only in their minds. Later, in processing these experiences, the soldiers would r eport that during the actual battle, they would feel very deta ched, even numb, from what was happening, even thou gh they may have been wounded themselves. At times, they re ported feeling as though they were standing outside of themselves, observing themselves going through the trauma of the battle, but not feeling anything. The y were dissociated from their reality. But their brain was recording all of the experience, exactly as it occ urred, and those \"mind and body\" memories were being reexperienced d uring a flashback. When someone is exposed to a \"psychologically distr essing event that is outside the range of usual hum an experience ... is usually experienced with intense fear, terror, and helplessness,\" (DSM III) then dis sociation usually occurs as a way for the mind to process the event w ithout overwhelming the person. Parts of the experi ence (either knowledge of what happened; the emotional feelings associated with the event; the sensory experiences of the event, or the behaviors expressed during the event) become separated from one's conscious awareness. The more frequent the trauma, the more dissociation occurs . This phenomenon is why children who have been sev erely sexually abused and tortured, are amnesic for those events. In a landmark university study by Linda Wi lliams hundreds of children brought into a hospital emerge ncy room who received medical confirmation of sexua l abuse, were contacted at intervals throughout a 20-year pe riod. Only one-third of these children, when reachi ng adulthood, retained conscious memories of the sexual abuse -- all others had repressed, or dissociated, those awf ul memories. Such is the power of the mind to block out painful experiences. During times of torture and extreme physical and em otional pain, the mind is in an altered state, as i t dissociates itself from reality . But there are other ways to alter the mind stat, for ex ample, by sensory deprivation, or meditation , whereby one focuses internally, with sensory stim ulation from the outside minimized or eliminated. You may recall in the 1980's that \"float tanks\" wer e popular. In a float tank you are floating on very heavily salted"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"water; you are enclosed in a totally darkened metal tank, and you float for an hour without any sensor y stimulation. Many people felt claustrophobic, and couldn't take it. But if you could stand it, you would eventually rep ort having an euphoric experience . If you had been hooked up to a brain wave machine (EEG), your brain would no longer be producing beta waves (the brain state associated wi th usual waking activity). Instead you would be in a theta state, the state associated with deep relaxation, as when you are just about ready to fall asleep (the twilig ht state). In this state, the brain produces lots of endorphin s, the body's natural \"feel good\" chemicals that gi ve you a profound sense of well-being. It is important to no te that this twilight state is associated with the ability to ra pidly absorb and learn information . Without the \"filtering\" mechanism of the conscious waking mind, information seen or heard \"pours\" into the subconscious mind . Biofeedback expert Thomas Budzynski of the University of Colorado Medical Center reports, \"We take advantage of the fact that the twilight state, between waking and sleep, has these properties of uncritical acceptance of verbal material , or almost any material it can process; it is in such \"altered\" states of consciousness that a lot of work gets done very quickly.\" (For much more information about brain research and technology associated with producing altered state s, read the fascinating book Mega Brain , by Michael Hutchison .) Other methods used to alter brainwave states inc lude, but are not limited to, rapidly flashing lights, drugs, phased sound waves, negative ions (electromagnetic energy fields), electroshock, alterations in gravity in the cerebel lum (spinning), microwave emitters, and lasers. It is vitally important to understand about dissoci ation, because in learning about how someone's mind can actually be controlled by someone else, you must understand how it is possible to program the human mind as you would a computer. \"Programming\" is a fairly recent term in the history of mind control (and is of course assoc iated with computer technology). Perhaps you'd recognize it be tter as \"brainwashing.\" In the POW camps, captors w ould refer to \"freezing,\" a term used to destroy the person's identity. Using food and sleep deprivation, isolati on, torture, and chronic assault on a person's values, and instillin g total dependence on the captor's for survival, a person's whole sense of self would be destroyed. They would be totally helpless, broken, with no wil l of their own left . They would then be ready for the \"brainwashing,\" or \"refreezin g\" whereby a new value system and a new identity wo uld be put in through reward and punishment, conditioning or \" programming\" that person to believe or do only what the captors wanted them to believe or do. (For more inf ormation on brainwashing, including USA and Canadia n government experimentation, read: Brain Control by Eliot Vallenstein ; Deep Self by John C. Lilly ; Inside the Black Room by Jack Vernon ; In Search of the Manchurian Candidate by John Marks ; Journey Into Madness by Gordon Thomas ; I Swear by Apollo – author unknown -- published by Canadian publishe r.) Just as it is possible to break down a person in or der to create someone you can control (by getting t hem to do anything you want them to do), so it is possible to program a part of a person's mind (a dissociated p art that is split off, by trauma or other means, from connection with reality). You can \"teach\" that part of the mind to do what you want it to do without the part of the mind that is conscious and aware knowing what's going on. Hence, people with multiple personalities report that they \"lose time, \" whereby they don't remember where they have been or what they have been doing. Here is how a patient, repeatedly sadistically sexually abused as a child, explains i t: \" Dissociation is a way of escaping the intolerable. I'm sure it happened first during the trauma itself , and was a sanity-saving way of dealing with overwhelmin g physical pain as well as the psychological pain o f betrayal. For me it took the form of physical numbn ess and cold, and to this day, when I dissociate, I most often go numb. First my hands and feet go; I can't feel them, and if my eyes are closed, I have no sense of where the y are in space. Then the numbness in my face starts. I can't feel my lips or cheeks. When I dissociate badly, t he whole body goes and I feel and move like a block of wood... Worse than the physical dissociation is wh at happens mentally while the physical numbness is in place. I guess the only thing I can say in comparis on is that it's the mental equivalent of white noise, or radio static, that can leave me blank-faced and sta ring into space. The thoughts that are there whip through at the speed of light with no coherence, organization or form. I get very confused. It can range from being a little vague and spacey to full white out where I don't see or hear much. This is really dangerous if I am driving. There hav e been some episodes where I don't"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"remember getting someplace . I also sometimes just \"clock out\" and lose time. When I come back to myself I may not be immediately conscious that I've lost h ours.\" – Penny During that \"dissociated\" time, when she \"clocks ou t,\" what is going on? Another part of the mind has taken over; in Penny's case, another personality is \"in charge of\" the body. This personality (or alter) interacts wi th others and carries out certain tasks, but when Penny \"comes to \" she has no knowledge of this other part of the se lf. As her therapist, I have talked to this other \"person\" ins ide (the person is really only a part of her mind) and I know the personality characteristics of this person. I know that this part of Penny responds to the name \"Diane ,\" she is outspoken and can get angry if challenged (as oppos ed to Penny, who is meek and allows others to tell her what to do). Diane also has a peculiar way of tilting her h ead, almost in a flirty, cocky manner, something I have never seen Penny do, as she is much more rigid and controlled, both in posture and feelings. How do these dissociated parts get created? And how did \"Diane\" come to be? And why? To answer these questions, I will let a programmer herself tell you . This person was used from infancy in the United S tates Government mind control experiments, and her job as a youth and adult was to \"split off\" parts of othe rs' minds in order to program those parts to do what the experim enters wanted them to do. By programming, I mean th at the human, in a dissociated or altered mind state, has been systematically and deliberately taught lessons , attitudes, beliefs, behaviors and responses to specific cues ( \"triggers\") so as to respond on command in ways tha t benefit the person/groups doing the programming. Just as Ivan Pavlov's dogs were taught to salivate to the sound of a bell, in anticipation of the meat that was delivered soon after, so human beings can be taught to respond in infinite ways to cues in their envir onment that \"trigger\" responses. Assume that first, the child h as been exposed to torture and hideous psychologica l and physical abuse to the extent that the child has learned to d issociate into altered states of mind. (Remember as well that current electronic technology -- as mentioned in Me ga Brain -- makes torturing children obsolete, in t hat trauma is no longer necessary to access altered brain states -- thus, programming people is much \"cleaner\" and e asier to do.) Here's how they do the programming: Techniques on 'Creating' New Children \"Daub fingertip size glob of vaseline or K-Y jelly on pressure points -- wrists, inner elbows, behind knees, under ears. Take ends of 2 wires (black and red are easie st, negative/positive easier identified) with metal attachments (round, copper, holes in center) and tape with surg ical tape on top of vaseline. Calibration - watch for muscular reactions, eye glazing, sweat ing, involuntary loss of bladder control, bowel control. Want to give enough of a current w/o being too much. Want child to remain alert. Words, codes given. Assignments given. 'Yes, one finger; No, raise two; Confused -- raise right hand.' Clarify instructions . If still confusion, time to stop, take a break. D o not allow any contact between patient and others until cycle is completed. Do not, under any circumstances, offer juices, snac ks, etc. which could be construed as a 'reward' until the cycle is completed . Check carotid pulse for significant elevation in blood pressure. Do not wish to affect a heart attack. Heart attacks can oc cur in children. (Children are outfitted with diape rs before the sessions begin, are also taken to the bathroom befo rehand. Keeps down unnecessary interruptions). Keep voice on same level at ALL times. Not hurried, not raised or lowered. Same pace at all times. Droning, hypnotic effect . Helps to stabilize heart rate. \"When instructions given to child, and received, th en and only then give reward of name for identifica tion purposes. Code phrases -- 'well done,' 'very good,' or 'you did real good .' Avoid hugs, touch, any other forms of physical contact . Eye contact necessary, stabilizing. Allow alter-s tate to form place of safety within, encourage alte r to describe internal surroundings. (All is taped, voic e-activated, recorded later in the computer records for others to refer to). \"One response is 'I want my mommy.' Necessary to remind child that ,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"1) 'Mommy is dead,' 2) 'Mommy brought you here' (only use if true), 3) 'Mommy is right outside – you can see her as soo n as you've finished,' or 4) 'Mommy told me to tell you to be a good boy/girl .' Room is kept low lighted for maximum effect. They p refer only one person (interventionist) to be with the child. Less distractions. They also prefer it to be a pers on the child will not be able to ID on a day-to-day basis in 'outside' regular activities. \"Sessions can vary greatly, dep ending on the time allowance, expense allowance, ur gency, etc. Occasionally exceptions are made for disciplinary m easures. May (in that case) be an all-nighter. Keep ing the room dark also helps simulate nighttime, which is conduc ive to their 'rehabilitation.' \" The children are taught responses according to Pavlov's theories -- inpracticum. This basically involves uses of 'triggers' usually found in the subject's natural, normal home-based environment. \"Audiological : Grandfather clocks, church chimes set for certain hours of the day/night are the most preferred. Long-running TV programs are effective on short-tim e bases (due to the fact that they may change times , etc.). Dogs that bark at certain times of night are also e ffective; revving of an engine; car door opening an d shutting; footsteps outside bedroom window. Preferable to use natural sights and sounds due to need not to arous e suspicions of any household members not actively involved. \" Visual: Phases of the moon, clock-faces (preferably digita l for younger children), lights in most neighbors' houses turning off, moon rays coming through window in dar kness of night (full moon), and fireflies can be ve ry effective and seemingly harmless trigger. \" Other: nursery rhymes, flags, date on a calendar, religio us holidays, hand signals, words, phrases, eye wink s; virtually anything can be used as a trigger. \"Step #1 is invasion , step #2 is intervention . Once the first plateau of the cyclic invasionary process is completed, the child will be 'tested' -- again in-o ffice, using a number of visual/audiological sight/ sound external invasion techniques to record the level of response of the subject (nicknamed 'knee-jerk' res ponse). This can be a valuable tool in assessing the cost-a nd-time-effectiveness of this particular technique on this particular subject. Those children who respond more spontaneously are c onsidered to be higher value prospects for future experimentation .\" Janus (the programming alter's name) Are you beginning to understand how scientific prin ciples and techniques are used to program people? H ere's more from \"Janus \": \"I personally was assigned 12 babies as an older ch ild . I was about 7 or 8 when I was first introduced to them all in a room. They were all children of families . So they were long-term projects . I programmed other children, too. I was found to have a knack for trou ble-shooting -- figuring how what went 'haywire' an d 'reprogramming' them. I didn't try to memorize the systems. That wasn't my job. My job was to CREATE alter personalities . There were other people who were more trained in the specific skills of teaching the alters specific jobs. Once an alter was created, an d trained to come out in response to a trigger, the n they had to learn their jobs. Sometimes I would visit di fferent locations and help train others how to trai n the children.\" Recall how I told you that technology is available that allows massive amount of learning in an altere d state to occur? Patients have drawn pictures of and describe d in detail very sophisticated electronic equipment used in programming. When I first discovered the book Mega Brain , I was astonished to see some of the very machines that my patients had described, years before the bo ok was published . Similarly, patients had described virtual reality machines used in training alters (dissociated parts) long be fore that technology was presented to the public . And even before machines were used in programming, enough was known through secret experimentation on human beings, that experimenters knew humans were c apable of memorizing enormous amounts of informatio n when in an altered state. In that theta brainwave s tate, we have access to an \"inner encyclopedia\" of all that we have ever learned or experienced. Thus when patients tel l us of their \"photographic memories\" and are able to recite"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"verbatim seemingly endless scripts, it is a phenome non that is very real and very understandable, if y ou can know how the brain works. This knowledge will also help you understand how programmers use audio and videotapes and movies to confuse people as to what is reality and what is not . In an altered state, people are forced to watch m ovies and listen to tapes that form what are called \"screen memories\" that hi de or distort the memories of what actually happene d to the person. If a person does begin to recall memories o f abuse, or memories of information that is suppose d to be buried so deeply in the unconscious that it never reaches conscious awareness (such as knowledge of abusers, the particulars of how people are programmed and abused , or top secret information ferried to others), the n the screen memories (also known as \"scramble programs\") pop up . When someone begins to tell tales that others rec ognize as the plot of a movie or television show (I heard the \"plots\" of the X-files from patients long before t he television show existed!), they can be discredited and not bel ieved as others say \"oh, she's just seen the movie and is remembering that .\" If any of the readers are still doubtful about whet her mind control really exists , I invite you to read the public transcripts of the hearing by the Senate Committee on Radiation Experiments that was held on April 15, 1997 . On that date, Valerie Wolfe (a therapist from New Orleans) and her patient testified before the Senate committ ee about the mind control experiments that are still being c onducted in our country . They were allowed to testify because, even though they were reporting mind control, rathe r than radiation experimentation, the high-level pe ople named as conducting the experiments were many of the same names that had been exposed as doing the radiation experiments. When they finished testifying, Valerie reports, \"yo u could hear a pin drop.\" It was not in the mandate of that committee to investigate the mind control experimen tation; but the Committee did formally issue a requ est to the President that a thorough investigation be conducte d. The transcript of this hearing is riveting; no o ne can tell the story more convincingly that those who have been th rough it. As you read Sue Ford's story, keep in min d these things that I have written. Know that thousands of people have come forth with information about these abuses. \"If people truly want to combat this phenomenon, it must be brought out into the public; it must be br ought out into the light of day, and it must be done so very publi cly so as to protect the people coming forth. It ca nnot be combated just on a national level, because it is internation al in nature. Governments work in collusion with ot her governments throughout the world; people who want power work in collusion with others; they use each other to gain social, economic and political power.\" -- Dr. Green (a prog ramming alter) Pamela J. Monday, Ph.D. Insights by Mary Lewis, LCSW AWAKENING TO THE REALITIES OF MIND CONTROL I was born in the Land of Lincoln, following the wa r to end all wars, in 1947. It was a time of new ho pe, and as a baby boomer born to a family of educators, I was ta ught to believe in God, motherhood, apple-pie and t he red, white, and blue: America was beautiful. I was raise d in a conservative, traditional home, the second o ldest child in a family of seven children. We practiced the Catholic Faith by tradition, and we children attended the l ocal parochial school when one was available. There was no physical or sexual abuse in my childho od , so of course I was unaware of its existence. Because the media had not yet beg un to play out the truth of such things, I actually reached late adolescence secure in the knowledge that the world was a very safe place in which to be. I met the man of my dreams as a senior in college, and we married after graduation. I look back over t hose years and I marvel at the simplicity of our life then. Th ere was nothing to fear, except of course the threa t of some awful communist country again trying to mess with the Uni ted States. I truly lived my life believing in our government . In 1985 I began to realize that a new career might be in the making, as I saw my children growing into th eir own and myself responding more and more to requests for hel p by various troubled people. I decided to go back to school"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"and get a Masters in Social Work. During my undergr aduate work, a professor discussed incest briefly, and then with some disdain, assured us that we would probabl y never see such a thing, since it only occurred in the \"Hills of Kentucky.\" I believed him. The idea of such a horri ble thing happening to another human being never cr ossed my mind again for many years. During my masters progra m, I again received no information about sexual abu se, or for that matter, any other abuse. I did not learn about addictions. I learned about research, and how to d o it. That is an over-simplification of my experience, but suffice i t to say, it did not prepare me for what I was to l earn in the field of social work as I came to know it. I was assigned an internship as a unit social worke r in a freestanding psychiatric hospital. Thus bega n my real education. In October of that year, I experienced a poignant moment, branded in my mind. One of the nu rses on the unit was commenting on the unusually high number of sexual abuse cases we had on the unit, when anothe r nurse commented, \"Oh, didn't you know this is borderline season?\" I was shocked to hear such a statement, bu t it was a long time before I understood the full implications of that remark. Following my internship, I was then employed as the unit social worker at this hospital. It was here that I began to hear bizarre stories of satanic ritual abuse from s everal of the patients . We also saw several cases of self-mutilation, something I sincerely did not know ever happened, m uch less in such massive numbers. Cutting, burning, using acid to burn the skin, even one patient who purposely pu t a screw in her leg and let it get infected. This was all new to me. I didn't know what to make of the ritual abuse stories; they were extremely serious in nature, and beyond my ability to believe. I had never heard of such a thi ng, and yet, hearing the same type of thing over an d over from so many different patients, confused me. Something was most certainly not right, but I still had no idea what was really going on. As I began my private practice, I began to hear mor e and more stories related to horrible, ritualistic , disgusting abuse . One particular case was most disturbing. This per son was most articulate about what had happened to her. Her childhood saga would be food for Stephen King . I was still confused and concerned about how I coul d be hearing so many similar things from such a diverse population of people . My belief system did not include even the possibili ty of such trauma, and yet the possibility that it might be true started to seep into my mind. Over a period of a ye ar and a half, I had three different clients draw pictures for me, talk to me, and cry to me about the horrors of what happened to them while visiting Disney World . They all three drew pictures, explained details and were horrified at what they had endured at the most wonderful of rides \"It's a Small World.\" This was my family's favorite ride, i n fact we so enjoyed Disney World, we had taken our children two years in a row when they were younger. So, inde ed I was shocked, and scared when I began to hear s uch things that were so similar, from people that did not know each other. Better yet, I was still extremely skep tical. I did not want to believe that it was possible. I did not wan t to give up my dream world. I did not want to chan ge my way of thinking . I acquired Brice Taylor's first book, STARSHINE : One Woman's Valiant Escape From Mind Control, at a conference where she was speaking. As I began to re ad her story, I actually felt sick, because so much of what she was describing in the book was so similar to what I was hearing from others . A client I had could have written the book, and yet, I knew this client had told me her s tory several years before the publishing of STARSHI NE. Still, none of this made any sense to me, as the idea of m ind control was still a very farfetched concept in my mind. I contacted Brice, who told me her real name was Sue Ford, and she and this client made contact, only to discover that they knew a lot of the same people, experience d a lot of the same programming, and endured their own private holocaust. My skepticism was eroded by this time, a s I personally witnessed the sharing of this misery . Although I had to completely alter my life concepts , my belief system, and my purpose in doing my work , I knew I had no choice but to stand beside these courageous people who had lived such lives of horror, and to h elp them to have hope. The mind control concept made more sense to me than just the ritual abuse alone. I now know that the ritual abuse was just a means to an end. As I continue to honor these survivors with my beli ef, I learn more and more about the evil that surro unds us, and the determination of that evil to succeed. It is wi th the same fervor that my husband and I persevere. No one can change my mind. I know too much now, I have seen to o much now, and my only hope is that others of you that read this book will believe her truth and help stop this living nightmare."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" I have concluded that the success of the programmin g depends on the triumph of the assault on the five senses. The programmers use sight, hearing, touch, smell, and t aste to alter a child's perceptions . The method used works on the principle of operant conditioning. For example, ton es paired with electroshock, in turn wires the comm ands about these things into the hard drive of the child's min d, in order to control them. Programmers very cleve rly use common things and ideas to guarantee that a child w ill be sure to encounter these things throughout th eir lifetime, thus assuring control. The telephone is an example of such programming. A programmed person under mind control is extremely tuned into the telephone. The tones are important , as well as the number of times a phone rings. It is extremely hard for a recovering person to let a pho ne ring, and often just the ring alone can trigger a panic-attack. The tones played in the act of dialing the telephon e can serve as a trigger to mind controlled victims and can be extremely troubling to programmed people. Things th at other people take for granted as just a helpful tool, play a frighteningly scary role in the lives of those who were tortured with mind-control. Certain themes have surfaced throughout the years, which to this day continue to amaze me as I hear th em over and over. The Disney Parks, MGM Studios, Disney Movies, Disne y characters, and Disney songs have been used in conjunction with the programming . My understanding of this is that using such a fam iliar and popular theme assures that the program will be triggered easily. To anyon e who is a Disney fan (and who is not), this is pro bably one of the hardest things to believe. However, sitting where I sit, hearing what I hear, and seein g what I see, I cannot refute this truth anymore. Certain animals are used in the programming. Dolphi ns are a common program. Birds are also used to ens ure the silence of the programmed person. The child is told that birds can hear what they do, and if they tell , the bird will fly back and tell on them. There is a constant fear of going to jail, as well. One of the ways this is instilled, is the child is forced into participating in some diabolic al, criminal act, and then the child is told they a re an accomplice . Thus, if they ever tell, they too will go to jail. Monarch butterflies are also used for programming. There is what is known as the \"Monarch Project.\" Again, I don't purp ort to understand all of this, I just know that bei ng obsessed with Monarch butterflies is one thing in one client , but to have it reported over and over again becom es suspect. The programmed people I have worked with seem to ha ve an obsession with their own birthdays. Once in r ecovery, unless the suicide programs are disconnected, the d esire to kill themselves as they remember their pas t is overwhelming, especially around the time of their b irthday, and this has proven true with each individ ual I see. Sleep is also an issue with programmed people. They rarely sleep for more than a few hours at a time, or they have bouts where all they want to do is sleep. There are sleep programs, designed to shut down the mind if it starts to remember. This is a serious problem for recovering people, and one that is often written off as mere d epression. This is another ploy of the programming; almost any one of the symptoms taken out of context could be attributed to another cause. All this is very cleverly orchest rated. There is programming associated with childho od games such as the game of LIFE. Played over and over again it is a way of instilling the idea of how their life i s to be played out. Grow up, get a job, make babies, make money, l ive happily ever after, so simple, clean, and coy. Another game reported to me, over and over again is the game \" No Place to Run, No Place to Hide .\" This game was actually physically acted out during the programming. The ch ild was made to run and hide, and then was tracked down and punished. The result being, the child learns they c an never get away from this horror. Certain television programs and actors have also be en a source of programming for the mind-controlled person . Over and over again I hear the same programs being mentioned, that they were forced to watch as childr en, and often feel compelled to watch in rerun form. Certai nly I know that we all have our childhood favorites , but the obsession that I have witnessed over certain theme songs, shows, and even entertainers goes well beyon d the norm. Using music as a form of mind control is insidious . Our minds are like steel traps for words of songs we hear as children and thus will trigger us immediately. For the purpose of mind control, hearing a certain song can send a recovering mind controlled victim into sheer panic. Two particular shows seem to be universally known to the recovering people I have seen: THE WIZARD OF OZ and IT'S A GOOD LIFE. The phrase \"follow the yellow brick road\" is a program used to trigger someone in to doing whatever he or she is told to do. Food is reported to me constantly as a trigger for many of the mind-contro l survivors. Oreo cookies are a big trigger, as well as M&M candies . My experience has been that if a mind-controlled person is asked how they eat M&M's, they will answe r with clarity as to the exact way they do so. It mig ht be by color, it might be by color sequence, it m ight be not eating a certain color; but there will be a pattern that m ust not be altered. If asked to do so, they will of ten be visibly"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"shaken by the request. Ask a non-programmed person how they eat them, and they might say \"by the handf ul,\" \"I don't like them,\" or just say that it's a silly que stion. Probably the most disturbing food I find universall y reported to be programming is McDonald's french fries . I know there is always some kind of taste war going o n among the fast food giants as to who has the best fries, but it is not O.K. if a person feels compelled to eat McDo nald's fries daily. The urge to do so is so strong, that several people have reported that this is their little secr et. It embarrasses them, because they don't underst and the overwhelming urge to eat them. I also know about fo od addictions, but that doesn't fit for so many of these people. The one program that has been a universal theme in all of the people that I have worked with over the past 10 years is their abject fear of going to hell for lying. Th is is a particularly clever ploy on the part of the programmers, because if indeed a person actually has the courage to begin to heal from this horror, and start revea ling to someone, they are instantly paralyzed with fear. The ultimat e insult to their truth is that they have been told that if they believe anything really happened to them, and tell, it will be a lie. It is a \"Catch 22\" designed to keep the silence. Thank God a few brave souls have reached beyond tha t fear and into the light of truth. This truth has set them free. For many of the people I know who were programmed a s children, this truth is now their reality. Like S ue Ford, they no longer have repressed the horror, but inste ad can recall it. Not unlike the survivors of the H olocaust, these courageous people have overcome their own private w ar, to conquer Evil in it's finest hour. To those w ho don't or won't believe what I know to be true, I pray for yo u to see the truth, to help those in need, and to s top the evil from spreading any further. Healing is possible, and is happening. Once the healing begins, the people can reach out to others that need healing. We need to light the \"can dle of hope\" for these precious people, and pass on the \"light of truth.\" Mary Lewis , LCSW AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION Who with conscience could read the following autobi ographical account and, in the name of freedom, jus tice and love, brush aside the misuse of power, human slaver y and mind control described in this book? For it i s true that we have still not rid the world of slavery and in this generation it is slavery born of a most malevolent and menacing type. In a society where competition for wealth, po wer, and control of others is foremost, we as a peo ple are doomed to self-destruction, unless we change. Our v alues need to change. We need to help our children grow to believe in equality and justice, and they need to b e taught the spiritual values that we as a society have come to disregard over the decades. Our country is a young 200 years old. At the conclu sion of the adoption of our Constitution. Benjamin Franklin was asked, \"What have you wrought?\" In his own words he answered, \"A Republic, if you can keep it.\" It has been through my life experience that I see t he need to take a serious look at how we have so da ngerously strayed not only from the ideals set forth in our C onstitution, but also from our fundamental God-give n spiritual values. I know that for my sons, daughter, myself, my ex-husband, and countless other men, women, and children, who at this time are unable to speak for themselves , the following amendment to the Constitution has b een violated. It reads: Section 1 . Neither slavery, nor involuntary servitude, excep t as a punishment for Crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist Within the Un ited States, or any place subject to their jurisdic tion. My children and I have never consciously committed a crime. WE HAVE NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO LIVE OUR LIVES IN FREEDOM. Instead we have been put into a hidden bondage by a heinous form of slavery -- o ne far more evil than has been in existence in our soc iety before. The magnitude of horror and the level of secrecy that shrouds it has allowed a level of atrocities agains t mankind to exist that surpasses even those in Naz i Germany under the leadership of Adolph Hitler; and those me n who worked in his concentration camps have carrie d his legacy to our country. Whatever term one wants to p ut to this hideous activity, it is one of total and complete"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"disregard for humanity, for human freedom, civil ri ghts and the right to live safely on this planet. F or, when we as a people allow certain individuals in our society to experiment with and enslave other individuals for t he so-called 'advancement of technology' or the 'race toward wor ld domination,' we are doomed. What most of you have not been allowed to know is t hat years ago, at the outset of the Cold War (if no t before), permission was given to a hidden group of so-called \"professionals and leaders\" to experiment on the u nsuspecting American populace in an effort to further a variety of advanced technology . The technology gleaned by the American leaders, medical professionals, and scient ists was and still is in the form of genetic engine ering, mind control, brain research, near death experimentation , paranormal/psychic experimentation, remote viewin g, time and space travel, bio electromagnetic frequency medicin e, and other advanced research that make our curren t level of technological understanding and application antiqua ted. I am not suggesting that the technology was no t, in certain projects, valuable; however, I am stating that it w as often attained by the American government at the expense of American lives, as many of its citizens were experi mented on without their knowledge or consent. Many books have been written describing innocent pe oples' firsthand accounts of various forms of ritua l abuse, unauthorized and non-consensual medical experimenta tion, genetic experimentation, radiation experiment ation, drug experimentation and mind control. And yet, the se numerous first-hand accounts of extremely violat ed human rights have been cast aside and denied, even by our own FBI, CIA and government. Why, you ask? I belie ve the following information, gathered by my personal invo lvement as Henry Kissinger's personal 'mind file,' will help you understand the situation we face and what has occur red. Morally I feel it is my responsibility to shar e with you what I witnessed as I walked among those participating i n these projects. After I have shared with you what I experienced, it will be your responsibility to choo se what you do with this information. And I will finally be able to rest, knowing I have done my duty, first to God and then to you, my fell ow citizens, by sharing the truth of my experiences so that you can be informed as to what has occurred, to your detri ment and at your expense, but without your knowledge or permiss ion. People often ask me if I'm afraid that my cont rollers might kill me. Honestly, I have had so many near-death experiences that I am familiar with dying . Death is not at all frightening to me. My life has been restored throug h Divine intervention countless times and I trust t hat when God is ready for me to leave this world, I will go, and I won't go until that Divine timing is completed . What is frightening is living without doing something to al ert people to the invisible danger and loss of righ ts and freedoms that are before us. Some things are so precious and sacred that to viol ate them is worse than death. Specifically, I am re ferring to the sacred nature of our minds and spirits and the Divi ne core bond that goes between a mother and a child . The pain and suffering that results from the destruction of this bond, due to a life of torture and mind contro l intended to intentionally shatter this bond and other family re lationships, in order to establish control, is so e xcruciatingly painful that I will do anything necessary in the se rvice of stopping it from happening in future gener ations. A few years ago, after I spoke at a Surveillance Ex po in Washington, D.C., an intelligence officer app roached me and asked me how I managed to stay alive. I explain ed to him that I sent documentation of my recollect ed experiences out to professionals who were vocal in regard to these issues, with a letter stating that if anything happened to me, my children, or my ex-husband, I ga ve them permission to more widely distribute my inf ormation. This officer laughed and said, \"Little lady, I beli eve you have the CIA by the balls! They are probabl y having to protect you.\" Although I am still alive, the harass ment that I will share with you later hasn't stoppe d. I submit this information to you as respectfully as I can. I apologize for the apparent lewdness of so me of the material, and yet this is how it happened, this is what occurred. Please forgive the nature of the wri ting, or how I need to present it, often in it's original context, the way it was experienced by the many parts of me . What you read is a glimpse into the events as experienced through the eyes of the programmed personalities who endur ed this abuse. You may notice the different perceptions of different personalities at varying ages, and some o f the values, or lack of them that they were taught. Much of the fol lowing information has been copied, often verbatim, from my private journals. Over the years, daily, I painstak ingly documented my memories, in an attempt to deal with and sort out the often vivid, though confusing, memory flash backs I had. What I remembered was so far from the reality I thought I had lived, that it was deeply disturbing. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"What you are about to read is a composite of years of memory work describing the details and informati on as I worked to untangle the knot. Having been programmed to have a perfect photographic memory greatly aide d me toward this enhanced, often meticulously detailed a ccount. The training my controllers gave me backfir ed on them. Once my secret life began leaking into my conscious mind, I experienced so many intrusive flashbacks n ot only in my mind but also in my body, that it forced me to r ecall these experiences in extensive detail to the point that it disrupted my everyday functioning ... so much so, t hat I was forced to leave my master's degree progra m in graduate school and enroll in daily therapy. In an attempt to understand and contain all the informati on that came flooding back to my mind, I was compelled for years to write out each and every memory the way I saw i t in my mind's eye, and heard, smelled, and felt it in my b ody, so I could attempt to maintain some semblance of my own personal reality. This information, chronicled in m y journals over the last 14 years, beginning in 198 5, created a way for me to report to you what happened to me. Desperately, I struggled and worked diligently over the years to pull myself together in an attempt to help my children, my husband, and myself. Looking back, I f elt like a person with no arms or legs attempting t o run an Olympic marathon. My body was able but I didn't hav e the use of my mind, which was shattered into a th ousand pieces and further locked away from me in a program med bondage. Although I couldn't think about it, de ep within my soul my heart ached and the wounds festered. People often ask me, \"How did you get out?\" I answe r, \"By the grace of God,\" and I explain that as I g rew older, although I could not think about what was causing m e so much pain, I had moments when I could feel tha t something was very wrong. When those deeply, emotio nally troubling and painful moments came, I asked G od to please help me. Through daily prayer and the leadin g of the Holy Spirit, I was led out of bondage, one step at a time, until my programming was broken and I was int egrated and free. It was then, and continues to be, horrifying to me when my experiences are validated because it makes them more real, and then I am less able to di ssociate from the excruciatingly painful emotional component of my past. During the initial stages of my recove ry I had to learn to reconnect to my body and emotions, to lear n even to cry in personalities that had never been allowed to express emotion. Then I had to learn to think logic ally and contain my tender, innate female emotions so that people could begin to hear what I was saying and not write me off as a hysterical woman -- although I had eve ry right to be, given the traumatic life my family and I manage d to live through. This manuscript is not a dramatization, as was my f irst book, STARSHINE: One Woman's Valiant Escape fr om Mind Control. Instead it is a documentation of even ts as they happened from the best of my recollectio n. It is not written to entertain. In fact, I hope you don't fin d it entertaining, for if you do, you've missed the point. The pornography that has proliferated in this world has destroyed countless lives of children, women, and men who were used in it and has taught those who view it to obje ctify people. The telling of the following informat ion is not done with the intent to further pornography and lewd sex ual behavior, but in an attempt to stop what has go ne on and to insure freedom of mind, body and spirit. I am now fully integrated and deprogrammed. I feel very fortunate to have survived and to have healed to the point where I can now be a spokesperson for the many who have been abused in similar ways and are not yet re covered enough to speak on their own behalf. And, there are many. Over the years, I have painfully witnessed t hose who reside in mental institutions, diagnosed as psychot ic, schizophrenic, borderline, or delusional; or ot hers locked up as political prisoners; or worse yet, those who couldn 't overcome their programming and committed suicide . Many others walk the earth dehumanized and enslaved in p rogramming, living a life of internal and external hell and terror, separated from themselves and their Divine Creator. It is for all of them that I divulge these very personal and painful parts of my life. Over the years, the CIA and other groups have strat egically and very effectively orchestrated campaign s to discredit victims and the professionals who attempt to help t he victims to bring the reality of what is actually occurring to light. Up until recently, the dark hierarchy that s hrouds and protects the secrecy of this hidden cont rol of many has been very effective in keeping this reality a secre t. The victims have not been heard. They continuall y suffer discrediting tactics in the courtroom through the i gnorance of uninformed -- possibly mind-controlled (or compromised) -- judges and lawyers; in therapy sess ions, often with uninformed -- possibly programmed -- mental health professionals and therapists. The church cle rgy, through innocence, disbelief, ignorance, fear, or possibly programming, often turn their backs on victims who need aid and protection.

If spiritually awakened individuals can't do it, then who can? The Holy Spirit has shown me it will take the most spi ritually erudite to stand in the face of this evil deception . Only by enacting the practice of spiritual discer nment and carefully listening to Divine spiritual direction, can this horror be eradicated forever. It is our la st and only hope. It is time the public is made aware so they can beg in to abolish the dark, controlling system that eve n began to target pre-school's in the 70's, torturing and programming children who didn't even come from an intergenerat ional satanic background, in order to ever widen their circles of an unpaid, slave labor force. I am continually amazed that the public is still swayed by the CIA-connected, False Memory Syndrome Foundation's propaganda , which explains that therapists instill these memories of horror in to their desperate clients and that children with l arge imaginations are making up these stories. Ask yourself how a child three or four years old co uld make up these vile stories that are beyond their age-appropriate understanding ... and what a coincidence that the accounts match othe r children's testimony across the nation . Have the children been secretly uniting, sharing their \"large imaginative experiences\" across the nation in order for them to all come up with similar accounts? The facts of many preschool court cases, the testimony of the children, and the bungling and misrepresentation from lawyers and judges in case after case has allowed the truth to be squelched. Those within the American Psychiatric Association who still cling to the false notion that Multiple Perso nality Disorder (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV now calls it Dissociative Identity Disorder ) is rare , rob the many suffering victims of the opportunity to recover. We need to begin to more fully understand that a chil d's, and especially an infant's, psyche is vulnerable and ca n be shattered into other personalities due to earl y childhood abuse. When we understand this we will be able to r aise more stable children who can then grow into he althy, creative adults. Many adults, like myself, find the mselves spending the rest of their lives trying to recover from their childhood. Early abuse wreaks havoc physically, men tally, and spiritually on the most vulnerable and m ost valuable resource we have, our children. Once again I apologize for the pornographic nature of some of this material. In light of my current Ch ristian values, it is difficult and often embarrassing to mention t he sexual perversions that I was exposed to, and ye t to alter the information that was brought back to my conscious a wareness through the eyes and perception of those personalities who were forced to experience it, see ms to compromise the reality of what actually happe ned. I have attempted to report my history in the best way I kn ow how, yet I have found it impossible to report my experience to you with the wholesome morality that now rules m y life. If you are faint of heart or have difficult y dealing with horrific or lewd material, please ask God to streng then you to face the truth set forth in this book. In the words of Edmond Burke , \" The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing.\" We have reached a point in time where it is imperat ive for good people to act. It is time for those wh o have any moral judgment to react, and then to pursue their r eaction with action. It will take all of us, standi ng for what we believe in, questioning old beliefs and old value s ystems until they are aligned with the Mind of Chri st. Do we really still believe in \"One Nation Under God,\" or have we lost our way in the hundreds of mindless du ties and realities presented by the mass media? When will we slow down? God is not a God of confusion, nor is H e a God of hurry, or suffering. He is our Almighty God, in Him whom we can trust. For generations humanity has be en deceived and those who are willing to put their tru st and faith in God, shall rise to His Glory, as He shows the way to victory. Our God, whom we once put in charge of our nation, is still waiting. He is still there, wa nting to be of assistance, and never in the history of mankind hav e we been in such desperate need of His help, of Hi s guiding hand.

Kissinger Then Secretary of State p. 51 Chapter One The Creation of Human Robot My name is Susan Lynne Eckhart Ford and I am a 48 y ear old, native Californian. Until 1995, I suffered from a debilitating condition known as Multiple Personalit y Disorder.2 In 1985 I embarked on the long and ted ious, painful road to recovery. Through years of therapy and depr ogramming I completely reintegrated my multiple per sonalities back into my uniform core self, and through the gra ce of God, I am alive today to convey to you my tru e-life experiences. This account of my remembrances will b e so shocking and amazing that you may feel that yo u've entered the 'twilight zone.' Many waking up today, call this making a 'paradigm shift' in reality; I c all it knowing the truth. But, do keep your faith in God and humanity, for, as my father reminded me day after day, \"The truth will set you free.\" My multiple personality condition resulted from wha t I had first thought in 1986 was solely sexual and ritual abuse. But, as I began to heal and remember more of my hid den past, I realized that ritual abuse was merely t he mind control trauma base my ritually abused, programmed, pedophile father, Calvin Charles Eckhart, and othe rs used to condition me for participation in the still active top secret Project Monarch, the Central Intelligenc e Agency's white slavery operation that is related to MKULTRA and it 's numerous sub-projects. I was raised in the affluent area of Woodland Hills , California, but was abused my entire life in many locations in and out of California, including hospitals, univers ities, and United States military and NASA bases, w here I was subjected to 'high-level' programming. The result o f many years of trauma, intentionally inflicted on me by my father and others to CREATE within me multiple pers onalities, was that I was transformed into a progra mmed, totally robotical slave that could not remember to think or tell what happened to me, due to the mind control and sophisticated programming I was under. I was used f requently in child and adolescent prostitution and pornography. By my preteen years, I had many personalities specially programmed to be the perfect sex slave --a \"presidential"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"model\" with government mind files and a photographi c memory equipped to deliver (most often through se xual encounters) messages, some cryptic, to top governme nt officials, entertainers, and other world figures .

But, i n April of 1991 I was forced to leave my home and family in Ca lifornia, due to a clever plot and threat to my lif e if I continued to pursue remembrance of my past 2 Multiple Persona lity Disorder (MPD): Current American Psychiatric Association listing in the Diagnostic and Statistic al Manual IV is Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID ). in therapy and try to become healed. One of my therapists, Margaret Paul , Ph.D., who is also a popular author, suggested th at for my safety I should leave Los Angeles for awhile . Upon her recommendation, I fled to the island of Kauai, Hawaii, where unbeknownst to me I was still part of the project and still not free. After I fled from California and was no longer living in the midst of my programmed abuse base, nor was I in therapy, I began having vi vid, detailed memories of being used both as a sex slave and huma n mind file computer to some of our nation's highes t level governmental officials in and out of the White Hous e. Among them: John F. Kennedy (sex and delivered messages). Lyndon Baines Johnson (sex and delivered messages), Henry Kissinger (masterminded my U.S. Government and international mind file use), Nelson Rockefeller (mind file use coordinated in conjunction with Henry Kissinger), Gerald Ford (sex and delivered messages), Jimmy Carter (delivered messages), Ronald Reagan (sex and delivered messages), George Bush (mind file use; he is a known pedophile and had se x with my programmed daughter Kelly), and top entertainment p rofessionals, such as my \"owner\" Bob Hope (sex and message courier). The media surrounding the exposes of Bob Hope's secret life and the books written by Arthur Marx (Groucho's son), The Secret Life of Bob Hope , and Lawrence J. Quirk's recent book, Bob Hope: The Road Well-Traveled , begin to portray some examples of the flaws to Bob' s seemingly All-American, patriotic, and family lov ing public image. My controllers and abusers were not low-leve l criminals, but instead were some of the so called \"adored\" leaders and entertainers of our country. I felt alone and terrified as I began to break free from the control I was under. Catherine Gould , Ph.D., an internationally known therapist with years of exper ience treating ritual abuse victims explained that she couldn't be my therapist, for fear of losing her license or bei ng sued since she sensed I was a 'high-level' survi vor. At that time, although I had begun to have memories of being with Ronald Reagan during the time he was Governor of C alifornia and other government officials, due to the fact tha t I was still under mind control, I had no way of u nderstanding what 'high-level' meant. At that time, many therapi sts, including my own - Margie Paul , were beginning to have their licenses pulled and often suffered profession al consequences for treating ritual abuse survivors , especially those who were \"high-level.\" In April of 1991, when I fled to the island of Kaua i, Catherine agreed to consult with me by phone, and advised me to write a book, which resulted in STARSHINE: One Woman's Valiant Escape From Mind Con trol . She further advised me to continue documenting the names, dates and places of my abuse in an effort to one day go public in order to free my husband, my children, and myself. Over the next year on the island, I recovered more of my memory, but was devastated to be separated from my children and tried to adjust to a radically changed lifestyle, including the fact that I was now living without my family, friends, and loved ones, and had very limi ted finances. I was overwhelmed with grief, carrying a burden that few wanted to seriously look at. Several people ste pped forward to help me in whatever ways they could, offering em otional support and friendship, some even financial support when I ran out of money, but no one could really ke ep me safe, until I was fully deprogrammed from ins ide of myself so I could not be accessed. To reiterate a v itally important fact -- until I was fully deprogra mmed, I was not safe. In 1991, there was no one who knew what I was talking about who could help me. I had to find hel p within myself. And I did. Throughout my healing process, Angels guided me when I was too afraid to connect with Christ, due to the satanic ritual abuse I had endured in th e church as a child. The Angels continually led me to books and incredible people , thereby fulfilling God's plan for my eventual freed om. Since multi-generationally abused and traumatized v ictims are selected for the mind control projects, my three children, Kevin, Kelly, and Danny were naturally tr ained to follow in my footsteps as assets of my con trollers. Except for Kelly, they are still locked into their abuse base. Despite my efforts to get help for them .

My parents named me Susan Lynne Eckhar t. The selection of inauguration day for my birth was espe cially meaningful given the position I would be gro omed to one day fill. My parents told the story for years that my first words were, \"I like Ike.\" Even at the earl y age of one, they were training me to be politically-minded and had m e cheering in a campaign effort for the President-e lect. Once my mother and I were released from the hospita l after my birth, my father began the rigorous training and intentional torture required to shatter my base per sonality with the goal of creating many separate and indivi dual personalities for training and use by others as I g rew older. When my mother left my father to babysit me, he withheld all food until I was starving. Then he held my bottle in front of me, but instead of allowing me to have the bottle, he would slip his penis into my mouth for m e to suck. I felt I was dying through suffocation, as my airway was blocked and I gagged for breath. There were man y such traumas to follow, most often on a daily bas is. For you to understand how I came to trust the things I bega n remembering at age 35 about my earliest childhood , I will share the following experiences. In meditation, I began r emembering small, inconsequential things at first, like the time my mother left my father to care for me when I was four months old. He laid me on top of the dining ro om table and watched as I fell off! I clearly remembered the panicked feeling of terror as I was falling and remembered the overwhelming sharp pain that resulted in my body as I hit the floor . I also remembered the color of the carpeting, the design on the wallpaper and other details about the room. We moved from th is house in Santa Monica when I was 6 months old, and I never saw it again. Unable to fathom what these earliest of childhood m emories could mean, I began reading about the exper iences of Vietnam veterans and how they suddenly relived flas hbacks of traumas they witnessed in war. I thought this might be the same type of memory phenomenon. In order to test my recall of this particular incident, I share d the details of this memory with my mother. Her reaction was one of amazement although she seemed terribly confused ab out my father's actions. She said I had described our first house and was surprised I could remember so accurately d etails from an event that happened when I was only an infa nt. Being the third child to a very busy mother, th ere were no pictures taken of me in that house that I could hav e seen. The validation she gave me made me feel mor e trusting of the other memories that soon began flooding back in to my awareness. Trauma to Create Multiple Personality Disorder Memories of trauma too overwhelming to bear as a ch ild unfolded for me to deal with as an adult. Bit b y bit, piece by piece, I began to remember and understand just w hat had actually happened to me as a child, but in no way did the memories come neatly packaged in chronological order . It took the test of time, as each memory fit into ones before and after them and, like a puzzle, with all the pieces laid in proper place, I began creating a more complete yet horrifically devastating picture. Armed with th at first validation from my mother and the support of two therapists, I began daily therapy remembering heino us tortures, terrifying abuses, and strange details that were painfully yet neatly compartmentalized into the rea lity of separate child and adult personalities prog rammed within me. Many had separate names. This was in 1987, two years after my initial \"awakening\" first began. And I was, now, for the first time, accurately remembering my earliest childhood. I was referred to Stuart Perlman, Ph.D ., a Westwood clinical psychotherapist, and began s eeing him a few sessions a week until the self-harm and suicidal cr ises I was attempting to live through, triggered by remembering things I was programmed forget, quickly required my sessions with him to escalate to seven or more per week. I was also having weekly sessions with Margaret Paul, Ph.D . At the time I began therapy, neither of my therapists was familiar with dissociation, Multiple Personalit y Disorder, or ritual abuse . The vivid, painful and often terrifying flashbacks and abreactions of the traumatic memory I retrieved in and out of their offices left all of us in a"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"quandary, trying to make sense of what was happenin g to me. Dr. Perlman wrote an article on MPD/ritual abuse for a psychoanalytical journal, where he shared that as time went on he came to understand that Multiple P ersonality Disorder was not as rare as he had been taught it w as in school. Although his quiet, aloof, non-intera ctive, psychoanalytical stance often made me uncomfortable during therapy sessions, I was later grateful that he had not interjected his own reality into my memory retrieva l process and kept to himself his initial belief th at I was delusional . My first session with Dr. Perlman was deeply touching as tears fell from his cheeks w hen I recounted instance after instance of childhood abuse . His wise words to me that day were, \"Everything you need to heal is within, you have all the answers inside of yourself .\" My other therapist, Dr. Paul, and I were continu ally perplexed as to what all the memories meant and didn't have an answer un til a year later when I attended a Victims of Inces t Emerge as Survivors (VOICES) conference in New Jersey by myse lf, where I heard a female minister speak about sat anic ritual abuse. At the end of the lecture, I felt num bed, as the speaker recounted many tortures similar to those I had remembered from my childhood. The \"big, beautiful, perfect fairy tale life\" I thought I was living beg an to crumble, one memory at a time. The following is a carefully compiled documentation of my past. When I was six months old, my father and mother dec ided to move to a more rural setting to raise their young family. My brother Jim was eight, my brother Rick w as four, and I was six months old. My father borrow ed money from my mother's mother to purchase a three-bedroom ranch home located in the midst of a walnut grove in Woodland Hills, California. This home was to be the base for hidden and extreme torture and trauma for me over the next 19 years. Those years of trauma should hav e been enough to kill ten children, but somehow it didn't kill me. My father told me each time he hurt me that he was doing it to toughen me, to strengthen me for the fu ture. In response, I was split into many personalities to co pe with the overpowering physical and psychological pain and betrayal. My father worked for others as a welder until 1957 when he decided to be his own boss, prompting the o pening of his own welding shop. This business, Eckhart's Welding Shop (located on Pico Boulevard in West Los Angeles), initially was our only source of income, since my m other stayed at home as a full-time housewife and m other. We lived simply and frugally, getting by on the amount of money my father earned. Sliced in between and e xisting parallel to the everyday conscious reality we share d as a family, was a very dark, secret and painful reality shared in sub-consciousness and in pain. I will share many of these slices of darkness with you so that you the reader can understand how this all came about. When I was a year old, my father placed me in a bla nket that was suspended by a rope from the high cei ling in our living room and spun me around and around and aroun d until I was completely dizzy and disoriented . He then introduced a trauma, like putting something sharp u p my vagina and my young psyche shattered, splitting off another personality to withstand the pain . He began sexually abusing me in my early months, by inserting objects into my vagina, gradually stretching it so that I w ould be able to accept a full grown man's penis by the time I was two. I was being groomed for early child prostitution, p ornography, and a position in the \"inner circle\" at church . When I was just months old, my mother recounts that she tearfully handed me over into the arms of her brother John who took me for a week to Santa Barbara. When she told me of this incident she always sounded lik e she had no choice, no free will from where she could command that no one could tak e her new born baby away from her. The memory of what happened in Santa Barbara with m y Uncle John remains inaccessible to me at this tim e, yet I know it must be significant. Unfortunately as you can well understand, my poor m ind-controlled mother never had a chance and was to tally manipulated by my father who I believe suffered fro m Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD/DID), had been ritually abused himself, and was most likely also under mind control. Much of the time my mother was a loving, caring, gentlewoman, but she was controlled . She spent her daytime hours obsessively cleaning house, ironing everything that she perfectly washed, scrubbing floors, washin g windows, cooking, and attending to our needs. Aft er dinner, while my mother did the dishes, my father sat down to watch television and read the paper. While he wa s relaxing, my mother began her next job doing the bookkeeping for my father's business; she didn't stop her dutie s or sit down until she collapsed into bed at 11:00 o'clock at ni ght. When I began recovering in the 80's, I asked my mot her why all she did was scrub and clean the house and didn't pay attention to me as a child. Her response was, \" Sue, looking back, I felt like there was something really dirty"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"about our home .\" My mother was able to feel what she wasn't allow ed to think about, and she was right; there was something dirty. She subconsciously tried to take care of the proble m in the only way she knew how; by cleaning it away . She slept through, was programmed, drugged, or wa s in a dissociative daze when I was being abused or when she was being beaten by my father or abused by othe rs. She obsessively listened to music , which helped her to tune out and mellow. Knowing what I know now, most likel y she was listening to music she was told to listen to in order to keep her memory of our actual life locked deeply within her subconscious mind, while the programmed reality of herself and our \"perfect happy family\" was kept ali ve through programmed phrases in the music. My fath er made medicine for my mother. She followed my father's or ders and programming to a tee. Dutiful to her progr amming, she delivered me to and from places where I was to be prepared, trained, programmed, and used, without ever being consciously aware of what she was doing. To this da y, if asked about it, my mother cries and says that , while she believes and feels the allegations of what happened to me are true, she just can't remember. Church Ritual Trauma Around this time, my mother joined the First Baptis t Church of Woodland Hills, and began taking me wit h her to church. Later, in therapy, I remembered and drew pictures of tunnels that I re membered running under the church that connected with neighboring homes of inner circ le church perpetrators . On Sunday mornings, my mother left me in the nursery while she went to the sermon. Members of the church staff, some of them neighbor women and the minister, ritualistically abused me in that church. The elder minister who abused me was Rev. Grant B. Yeatman . By age two, I was out of the church nursery and att ending a small Sunday school class with other child ren. One Sunday, when I was a bit older, Rev. Yeatman walked into my Sunday school class and watched as we played a game and drew pictures. He pointed to me and said t hat I was \"God's chosen\" and told me to follow him. Once we were outside in a protected area, he forced my head down under his robe to perform oral sex on him lik e my father had prepared me from birth to do. After I was finis hed, he wiped my mouth with a handkerchief and told me that I was going to hell for what I had just done, but tha t I would be forgiven if I never told anyone about it . He further offered to pray for my soul and then sent me back t o my Sunday school class. Another Sunday, after bei ng sodomized in a back room by Rev. Yeatman , he took me by the hand back to my Sunday school c lass, bent down and pointed to a picture of Jesus sitting with the little children around him and whispered, \" Jesus will never love a little girl who is as bad and evil as you.\" From then on I believed there was something terribl y wrong with me and that I would never fit in with other people. I figured Jesus couldn't love me because I was so b ad. Parts of me died inside. But deep within my soul, in my innermost hidden and protected self, angelic beings continually reminded me of God's love for me and o f their support . When I was tortured to the extent of being projecte d out of body due to the extreme pain, Jesus' Angel s spoke lovingly to me and explained that I needed to go back into my body, that some day when I was old er I would understand . But subconsciously, in my limited child understan ding, I believed I was unlovable and hideous in the eyes of God. Other Sundays, different children were \"God's chosen\" and had to leave the room with the minister. Many of the people who worked at the church, the ch urch secretary and the Sunday school teachers, were neighbors of ours and, I now understand were most likely ritu ally abused as children and were carrying out their violent actions via their own unconscious childhood program ming. Mrs. Winkler , the church secretary, lived across the street. In addition to Christianity, she also practiced sor cery and witchcraft in her darkened home , isolated and protected from outside intrusion by drape-covered windows. As a toddler, my father would wake me, early on Saturday or Sunday mornings and take me across the street a long with a carrot, to \"feed the horsies.\" We always did feed t he horses but the actual purpose of these outings w as to get me out of the house to go see Mrs. Winkler for what they c alled \"my training and preparation.\" Mrs. Winkler lit candles and laid my tiny body down on her table, performing chants over me , while she was sticking sharp needles in my feet, burning me with the hot candle flames, or scaring me with spiders . She would say, \"Hold real still, Susie, so this potion can get in . You will be powerful and very special one day . Your father is paying for this, for you to be made special beca use he loves you. You will be known.\" She told me at other times that I was chosen by God to fulfill some mission. Instead of organized Sata nism, she practiced her own perverted form of Christianity wi th the purpose of \"purifying me\" to rid me of all e vil. She never"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"directly addressed Satan , but instead spoke of hell and damnation; it was a fire and brimstone style of fundamental Christianity, mixed with witchcraft . Mrs. Winkler cut pieces of my hair and saved them for rituals that were held with other \"inside\" church members and my father in outdoor rural places, in the middle of the darkene d night. Trauma Programming For years, my father performed a variety of brutal, ritual-type physical and psychological abuses, amo ng them: confinement in closets, cages, and a coffin, while I was told I was being left to die; near drowning; isolation; needles inserted in sensitive body areas; food and sleep deprivation; electroshock via electric wires, welding equipment, cattle prods , etc.; drugging; sophisticated hypnotic and electron ic programming; tying me upside down to walnut trees out in the isolated walnut groves and other places ; forcing me to participate in torturous rituals and orgies; and sexually abusing me, each time in more perverted ways . At that time, Woodland Hills was still in its own i nfancy. At first, there were only two or three othe r houses built on our street, insuring my father and others plenty of wide open spaces to conduct their crimes. In 1952, what is now known as the \"101 Freeway\" had not yet been built. The area was still largely undeveloped and rural, a llowing for these crimes to easily go undetected. While I was s till very small, my father had an affair with anoth er church secretary named Selma McGrew who lived in the house behind ours. She participated in my \"preparation\" by allowing my father to include me in the sex they we re having . Being so young and small I often felt I would be killed during these encounters, and so I split off more personalities to endure it. Nighttime was never intended for sleeping at our ho use but instead was a time of training. My mother w as the only one allowed and/or commanded to sleep. My two older brothers, Jim and Rick, and my father came into my room night after night, creating an endless array of dif ferent forms of sexual abuse, all under my father's direction. My brother Rick , who is four years older than I, was selected to participate more often and my f ather used him to help \"prepare\" me for use as a child prostitute and for my approaching debut in pornography. The two of us were sexually abused together and were both electro shoc ked with bare electric wires to our genitals . I painfully remembered my brother sitting robotically while my father attached a bare wire to his penis and then i nserted the opposite end in the electrical outlet, sending his little body into uncontrollable spasms. Tears flood ed my brother's eyes and ran down his cheeks as he then was forced to watch as I was electro-shocked. For years my mother told the story of how she conti nually found my brother hiding behind the couch sho cking himself by inserting bare wires into the electrical outlet. She laughed a kind of confused, questionin g laugh as she spoke this. She probably couldn't think to question where the bare-wired cord came from or why her you ng son was continually seeking to electroshock himself. I stuc k a table knife in an electrical socket so often th at there was a knife in the kitchen drawer that was notched from b eing repeatedly inserted into the outlet. This unco nscious act reinforced our programming. I was often awakened and drugged in the middle of t he night by my parents in order to attend rituals that were performed in the empty lot behind the church and at other locations around Wo odland Hills . Many of the gullies and outdoor places that were us ed for rituals when I was a young child have since been developed into homes or large cement drainage areas , but in the 50's these areas provided seclusion fo r this group. The whole congregation did not participate in these nightly horrors, only a select inner circle was al lowed in . At two, I was initiated into the inner circle with a celebration dedicating me as the bride of Christ . I was drugged, dressed in a long white lace gown, and passed aroun d the circle of drugged members as they sat around a bonfire in a vacant lot, during the middle of the night. Each member fondled me sexually, then I was lain on an a ltar to be raped and dedicated to Christ and the group. The inner circle members wore black robes and parti cipated in sexual orgies and the killing and ingesting of animal and human flesh . Their belief was that these cannibalistic and sexua l acts would transfer the energy or life force from the victim to them in order to make them more powerful. I was involve d in endless rituals that included being burned wit h candles, having crucifix's jammed up my vagina as I lay on an alter or hung upside down on a cross, ha ving pins inserted into every area of my body including my va gina and the roof of my mouth, and having animals and babies killed in front of me and being forced to eat their raw flesh and drink their blood or urine . Other children were involved in the rituals, and when we reached a cert ain age we were forced to participate in killing an imals and"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"babies. In order to psychologically survive these e xperiences, many additional personalities within me were created. Nothing was ever as painful as being forced to infl ict pain on another or watch as others were torture d or killed. My Doll Collection I had a doll cabinet that my father had specially m ade for me. It was filled with dolls from all over the world, that were given to me to love. My father used my dolls t o program different personalities within me, as he abused me night after night. Often when my father tortured me he would hand a di fferent doll for me to hold in order to create different parts of me with different identities tha t in my young mind I could relate to the doll I was holding. He told me the doll in my hand was part of me but separate and then he would call it by name. There was the li ttle doll with the red hair and freckles, the baby doll, Cyndy the bride doll, Rebecca, Sally, Thumbelina, Barbie and Madame Alexander, to name a few. There were dolls everywhe re around me, especially in that doll case that my father had made for me with the sliding glass window front so the dolls could be seen. Each doll was \"displayed\" which my father said meant they couldn't play until he said it was time for them to come out of the case. At ni ght when he woke me for abuse, he took out the doll whose perso nality was to be the front, or presenting, personal ity of my inner system of created personalities. As he pulled a doll out of the doll case he'd say, \"she's no lo nger on display, she can come out and play now,\" and at that tender age, I would switch into the personality my father called forth. Then he would say, \" You Susie, will step aside as Doll fully enters you r body . Whenever I snap my fingers three times, Doll will enter the body and Susie will step aside, like this now ,\" and he would snap his fingers three times and I wou ld follow my father's command, totally and complete ly. Holidays Holidays always signaled times of trauma . One Christmas I awoke excited to see what Santa h ad brought for me. My two worlds and the personalities that lived in t hem were continually subjected to different realiti es, and this day was to be no different. Susie in her red velveteen robe got special treatment while other personalitie s had \"Xmas,\" a very different painful and evil reality. While Susi e got a Christmas stocking full of goodies, Sharon got razor blades and coal and parts of dead animals. \"Sharon\" was an other one of my inner personalities my father creat ed, which he developed as my \"inner twin\" to Susie, my conscious everyday personality. One Christmas ritual trauma I vividly remembered was when my father laid me down on the r ug in front of the fireplace and placed his finger inside my vagina while he readied a hot poker in the fire. So mehow putting me in a trance-state, he began, \"You won't feel this. You will only continue to feel the pleasure, just like I am rubbing now. Does it feel good?\" \"Ye s Daddy,\" I robotically answered. \"Good, then when I do this it will only increase th e pleasure,\" he kept his finger in place until he g ot the hot poker out of the fire and as he put it inside me, he took his finger out and as hypnotically commanded, I felt only the pleasure of the hot inside me . Very lovingly he said, \"Very good, honey. You're doing very well. Now take a deep breath and count to three and feel like you have to pee. Then when I take this out, you will feel even more pleasure. Okay?\" \"Yes, Daddy,\" I said putting my little hand up in f ront of my face while I counted off, \"One,\" as I he ld up one finger, then \"two,\" putting up two fingers, then, \" three,\" and when he had taken the poker out, I felt really happ y. It didn't even hurt. I couldn't feel the pain of the r ed-hot thing. In months that followed, I reached ou t and touched a piece of red-hot angle iron when my father was weld ing, and when it burned my hand badly, I was surpri sed. I didn't understand that it would bum me. My father w as an expert at those \"games.\" At other times he pu t something scary in front of my face to startle me before he d id something traumatic to me. Then he would tell me to feel numb while he put a silver metal band around my wrist an d forehead and would shock me with the black box th at was attached to the bands with wires. He'd say \"you're doing very well,\" but my face would be sweating and it stung when he gave me what he called \"a jolt.\" At odd ti mes, even when other people were around, my father would say, \"Do you want a jolt?\" I'd say, \"No,\" while I giggle d nervously, acting like it was a game but it wasn' t. Often after one of these jolting experiences, I felt so sleepy and my mom would say, \"What's wrong with you? Are y ou sick?\" \"I dunno,\" I'd say, because I didn't know anything. To know was to 'know,' and to 'know' was very bad a nd you got"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"very hurt. So certain personalities within me took the pain and torture after which I would be switche d back to Susie who had no knowledge of any of it . There were nights my father would wake me out of sl eep and devise ways to spin me until I was totally disoriented, after which he took me to look at myself in front o f a mirror and called me by another name other than my own, \"Sandy, that is you in the mirror, and Sandy is my friend. She is going to help us. She is a friend of Susie's, but Susie doesn't know Sandy exists. Susie doesn't even need to think about you, Sandy.\" And these were so me of the tactics used to shatter and then create alternate i dentities within me from a very early age. In hypno tic trance I was told, \"The balloons will take you away, take you to the rooms with the many personalities, but as you look at each one, you know that they are you. They are all you. But only one at a time. One room and one person at a time.\" Other nights, I was awakened from sleep and sexuall y abused to create the dissociative barrier and to create more personalities or attitudes. I was told, \"Now look i nto the first room. There's Darla. Isn't she cute a nd pretty, and she is always happy. Darla's dedicated to the stars. Sh e always knows just what to say and do to make othe rs feel good, to make them happy. Now look into the second room. There's Sandy. She's the dancer. She can dance very well and she is able to bend in all different directions ... to everyone's amazement. She's not at all embarras sed to take off her clothes in front of people. She likes that, it make s her feel good. But she can only do that when the time is right.\" My father also placed stars on my ceiling that lit up at night to remind me of the programming. Over the years my controllers created programming f or every single thing they could dream up . And they programmed in angel personalities intended to handl e the pain when I could not . But their spiritual short-sidedness left them in the dark when I transcended their crea ted angelic personalities, and left my body escorte d by real Angels . I owe my life to God and those beautiful loving B eings who kept my soul and my love intact as they continually interceded for the little girl they wit nessed tortured unceasingly. Military Base Programming Dick Hof was a marine in the reserves. He and his family mo ved in next door when I was around three years old. He told me he didn't, know exactly how to treat lit tle girls because he only had boys. On certain week ends he wore his uniform and took me to military bases where the men wore tan uniforms. They saluted him when he wa s around and he acted very normal until we were out of the o ther men's sight. He took me into top-secret places where he showed some sort of pass to gain entrance . Once we were in the secret place he put me into an empty, cold, cement room and restrained me to a metal examination table . There were bright lights overhead and the men tha t joined him put bands around my wrists, ankles, and forehead, t hen turned out the lights and left while they shocked me real bad . They had a screen I had to watch and messages I lis tened to immediately after I got shocked . Sometimes Dick carried a briefcase that had some of my favorite do lls and toys inside, like my dolly with the red hai r and freckles and my sock monkey. When they hurt me they often pretended to hurt my d olls and toys, too, and told me that my dolly friends would keep reminding me every day abo ut what happens, \"if you don't obey and follow the rules -- then you get zapped,\" and they would shock me again . Dick also threatened me with his gun and said tha t all the men had them, and if I \"stepped out of line\" it wou ld be over for me, so I'd better listen up and obey the rules. The doctors played tricks on me while I was drugged. Th ey played day and time tricks trying to mess me up. They told me over and over that someone other than the person who really brought me there did. Most of the time I knew it was Dick Hof. They told me this astronaut brought m e and a man in an astronaut suit would walk in and say, \"I am the adult who brought you here.\" I'd say, \" No you're not, my neighbor did .\" So they would inject me with more drugs and keep hammering verbally at me over and ov er until I'd break and agree wholeheartedly with th em . But inside I had to remember to keep the truth hidden i n a part of me, so I'd not lose control of reality and believe their lies. Sometimes I felt like I shattered and went ov er the edge and couldn't really tell what was happe ning. At those moments I'd pray to God that another part of me was remembering what was really happening because I co uldn't maintain myself any longer. After they were through with me I was so messed up that I needed their hel p getting off the table and then to walk, and the next week I'd h ave to stay home from school because I was throwing up and very sick. My mom said I just had \"the flu.\" All this to rture and mind manipulation kept my inner and outer worlds far apart. "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"There was a cabinet way up high in our kitchen and Dick Hof told me that I could be like a monkey and climb up there to get the little white candy pills that woul d make me feel better, but I couldn't tell my mommy because he said she wasn't really my mommy because she was bor n of lower class and he said I was upper class, lik e my father. He said my mom didn't know enough to help me, so if I hurt I could climb up and get the pills and eat them and feel better. There was another military base I was taken to when I was about five. A doctor in a white lab coat exa mined me there. He questioned me a lot in order to check all my \"systems.\" As you can see, this abuse was very intentional and very premeditated, with long-range plans and go als. The Network of Abuse Widens The trauma was ubiquitous and involved all the peop le who were close to me, and others who were strang ers. Threats of consequences if I remembered or told, ma de during times of extreme trauma, were buried deep in my subconscious mind and dictated my actions daily. Hu ge amounts of my own subconscious vital energies we re used to keep my personalities in control and to keep sec ret the activities in which I was involved. By the age of four, I was taken to my father's frie nd, Andy the policeman , where I was instructed to perform oral sex on Andy, in exchange for a courtesy card my fat her proudly carried in his wallet that pardoned him from any violation he might acquire, should he ever be stopp ed by a police officer. At a very young age, I was subconsciously aware that everyone was in on these activities and that policemen wouldn't even protect me, but that k nowledge was kept from my conscious awareness because I believed the reality, as my programming commanded, that I h ad a perfect life. When I was less than five years old, my father took me to Long Beach for what my mother was told was a visit to my father's Aunt Maude. We did go to visit Aunt Mau de, but really we were there to meet with Uncle Cha rlie. Uncle Charlie was very distinguished looking and wo re very formal clothes, even though this was just a family gathering. At this young age, although I sensed thi s was a very important event, I had no way of knowi ng how pivotal this meeting would factor into the design o f my life. In a complete nightmarish horror, I watched as my grown father looked retarded and became very childl ike when this relative , Charles Lilley Horn , spoke to him . And when the talk turned to subjects I could not fa thom, and Uncle Charlie held out a paper for my fat her to sign, I pulled on my father's hand and begged him, \"Daddy, stay big, this is really important, please Daddy.\" But due to my father's own early childhood abuse, he could not ma intain his adult mental state because he, too, had Multiple Personality Disorder, with many wounded, fragmented , hurt children inside of him whose consciousness had also been programmed for use by others. And so, when Uncle Charlie asked him to sign the paper, he reached out robotically, and without thought, signed it . Somehow I knew that this event was a very importa nt moment when I needed my father to pull himself together to protec t me. But he was not able to, due to his own dysfun ctional state of mind. Uncle Charlie further directed my father where to take me for th e early programming that involved machines and told him about the arrangement with Bob Hope and the connection to the government . My father continued to look retarded and just kept robotically shaking his head , nodding in agreement, while Charlie told him what to do. Slave Auctions Elitists in the market for mind control slaves atte nd auctions that appear at first like children's fa shion shows and then progress to striptease acts . I made \"appearances\" in many shows before I was a ctually sponsored or sold. My father took me to a slave \"model\" auction where I w ore a fancy white taffeta and black velvet polka-do t dress, a hat and matching purse that my mother had bought for me at the expensive Stardusters clothing store. Bob Hope At this particular show where Bob Hope bought me, t here were lots and lots of little girls and boys co mpeting. They said these children were what they called \"sponsore d\" if they were chosen . And they said it was better to be chosen"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"early because then the sponsors (owners) could mold you the way they wanted. There was a modeling ramp where all of us children were displayed. I modeled casual clothes, then sophisticated evenin g clothes, and then sensual/sexual attire and, finally, appeared totall y naked . First I performed Swan Lake Ballet in pink feathe rs for my casual and wore black velvet for my formal and my n aked performance was called \"the tiger dance.\" I won first place at this show and was sold to Bob Hope on the open market . They put a white cape around my naked body and Bob came up and stood with me while everyone in the audience cheered. Somehow it seemed like a sport for some of these people to attend auctions . Then I was seated again next to my father. When t he whole show was over, an older man dressed in a tuxedo came and escorted me to Bob Hope who shook my hand and said, \"Hi ya, Honey. Do you know who I am?\" \"Yes, Mr. Hope.\" I answered like I had been instruc ted. \"I'm going to be your man, but we'll have to talk m ore about this later ... when you're a little older .\" He laughed. I smiled at him and said, \"Thank you, Mr. Hope. My father will be very proud.\" But my father never cam e over to meet Bob. He stayed in his chair until the man in t he tux ushered me back to him. Throughout my formative years, I was molded to be e xtremely sexual through the sexual abuse with my fa ther and others. The personalities that were created from th at abuse didn't always experience the encounters as abusive, because that is all they knew. Bob later told my fa ther through an instilled message delivered through me during an incestual encounter with my father, \"Daddy, Bob say s he wants me to really love sex and have a lot of it. Okay?\" \"Sure honey, whatever you want. You're the boss,\" m y father answered from his own split consciousness. Bob was Catholic and so was the part of me that per formed. She was my \"inner twin sister\" for programm ing purposes, to keep that part of me separate from my created \"normal\" reality and her name was Sharon. Bob said he liked Catholic girls because they were easy and he liked \"em like that. \" Bob was always racy until he got to acting old around 1987. I had a lifetime of Bob Hope and h is antics, and over the years, he lost his funny and happy persona and became just a mean and nasty old man . And then, he became cruel to me, there wasn't anything fun left in him. He was just real old and mean. Uncle Charlie Consciously unbeknownst to my parents, I was in con tact when necessary with my \"Uncle Charlie.\" He esc orted me to many affairs when I was a child, even in Europe. Often they were arenas where the mind control elitists ga thered to share their latest creations . At these gatherings, I walked out on a ramp on Un cle Charlie's arm. I was the \"latest in human technology,\" and all the \"uncles\" were the re to display their \"wares .\" It was a fashion show of sorts for what they called \"children attendants.\" Men in the audience held little placards and they held up cert ain numbers for different things. I think they were like judges. I don't think they wanted to buy me because someone e lse already had. While I was presenting, a man announced I had alrea dy been sold to, \"...a very funny man they say, cal led Bob Hope . Do you know him?\" And everyone in the audience la ughed . When I asked Uncle Charlie why those people were there and what we were doing there, he said, \"This is a show for Cadillacs and you my dear,\" he took a hold of m y chin, \"are my Cadillac.\" \"I am? What is that?\" I asked very enthusiastically, straightening my blue satin dress and pushing on the skirt that kept popping up on t he other side due to the hoop around the bottom. \"A car,\" he answ ered. When I kept asking questions he said that big word others also used to describe me, \"My, you are preco cious, aren't you? Well it's time for you to run along now,\" at w hich point another man in a suit took my hand and l ed me away. Later that day when we were alone, Uncle Charlie very secretly and with great import informed me tha t he was my real father and that my dad wasn't my real father, but had ado pted me for some very specific purposes. He said it was my destiny, but I didn't know what that word me ant either, and didn't ask because I was still pretty upset about my dad not really being my dad . Uncle Charlie said he had the money to take care of me in the ways I deserved and that my father never would have the money to do wha t he was going to be able to do for me. I didn't un derstand what this all meant then but he made it sound good. (Forty some years later through my constant search to piece together the actualities of my life, I would discov er that Charles L. Horn was the owner of Federal Cartridge Company , which later funded Olin Foundation , where he sat as President ) "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"When I asked Uncle Charlie who my mother was he just nodded quickly and said, \" You don't have one, it doesn't matter .\" He seemed busy like I was bothering him by inter rupting his thoughts or something. I guess he didn' t understand the needs of a child my age. So I went ahead and made up my own imaginary mother . I created her to be sort of plump and happy and she made great apple pi es and cookies and all sorts of candies that we ate anytime we wanted. She was 'the perfect mother' for \"Sharon.\" So as I understood it from the other side of my per sonality structure, Charles L. Horn was Sharon's -- my inner twin sister's -- father. Uncle Charlie said he wanted me to call him Uncle Charlie instead of dad because he had \".. . some very important business contacts that just w ouldn't understand if you called me father, so call me Uncl e Charlie .\" Often he introduced me to people as his niece , Sharon Weatherby . Sharon, the wild personality, is who Bob Hope purchased from Uncle Charlie and it was Sharon who was trained to be stunning, smart, sexual, comforta ble with wealth and elite family members. Uncle Charlie, who lived in Minneapolis in the summers and Scottsdale in the winters, said he loved me but couldn't spend a lot of time with me because of business, though he woul d be a powerful part of my life. Uncle Charlie physically introduced me to Henry Kissinger one day in an open grassy park-like area when I was very little . I shook Henry's hand and Uncle Charlie explained that Henry was my \" Uncle Henry .\" So I, as Sharon Weatherby, began to have a whole new family and it just kept growing and growing, adding \"uncles\" here and there and everywhere. Henry Kissinger When I was little, with a short pixie haircut, Henry Kissinger would call me on the phone at home. In those days, those personalities who were created by and for him thought he was funny. He set up times of connectio n by telling me beforehand, \"meet me on the comer at 7:00 p.m.\" and that meant to be standing at the direct corner of the kitchen cabinet desk at home at 7:00 p.m. to answer the phone. So I'd stand there when it was 7:00 p.m . and when he called I'd pick up the phone real fast like he h ad instructed me to do. Henry, who communicated to me as \"Susan\" rather than \"Sharon,\" then said, \"Hello Sus an, how are you this evening? I am just testing.\" \" Oh, hi,\" I said as I smiled and twisted my short hair. \"You can han g up now, I was just testing.\" So, I hung up and we nt off to play in my room. Henry was in contact with me often. I think he had studied lots of psychology so he kne w how to best control me . He used positive psychological means because he sai d he felt it would work better . My mom said, \"Who were you talking to?\" She had on her red Christmas dress and her slippers. Her hair was still brown. I shrugged and said, \"No one,\" because due t o the programming I was already under, my normal ev eryday conscious personality didn't house the phone experi ence with Henry Kissinger. I wasn't lying, the even t was registered under a different personality than the o ne that interfaced with my mother. Henry could call anytime and 'get me.' When I saw him in person he always said r ight off, in a silly teasing voice as he reached ou t and tickled me, \"I'm gonna get you.\" Which switched me to the p ersonality he wanted and in that way he accessed, o r \"got me.\" Henry set up a group of personalities to be my neig hbor's, \"Joe's and Mary's child.\" He told people it was an experiment he was performing to see if one person c ould be brought up in two ways from two different p erspectives to see how the physical/genetic influences really d id work since both personalities' mindsets shared t he same physical body and genetic structure. It was a controlled experiment about the role envir onment and behavior versus genetics played in IQ . They wanted to see how strong the mind could be - if it was the overriding factor. They were trying to see if thinking you were elite and being brought up elite would increase IQ or if a common c hild would have the same IQ if not stimulated as much . Susan was the common experience part of the exper iment, the control; and Sharon, the inner twin personality counterpart, was the elite. More on this twin programming in th e next chapter I was instructed by Henry Kissinger to eat alphabet cereal on certain mornings and do mental exercises that he gave me. For instance, I had to get the alphabet sorted from the box and all lined up on the kitchen table. Then I had to put a piece of cereal that was shaped into an 'a' o n my tongue and then hold up a mirror and look at i t in the mirror. I had to do 20 of the alphabet backwards and 20 of th e alphabet forward while I was looking in the mirro r. It was usually only 20 because often some letters were mis sing from the cereal box, so Henry said to just do 20. I don't know why I had to put them on my tongue and then st ick my tongue out with the letter on it and look in the mirror, but I did it just like Henry said. My mother got ma d at me because she said I should eat my food not p lay with it, but she didn't understand my need for training. Hen ry said she was uneducated and ignorant, and that h e was making me into a genius. I didn't know what that me ant. Other times, I had to focus my eyes on a pin t hat was stuck"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"into the top of a pencil eraser and follow it back and forth and up and down. And I learned to cross o ne eye. leaving my left eye looking straight ahead. All this was done in preparation for my later use a s Henry's 'mind file' . Further Condition Following instructions, my mother took me to \"meeti ngs\" at a church lady's home who lived behind our c hurch. The purpose of these meetings was to instruct my mother how to \"train me.\" She was given instructions on f orms of punishments and abuses to give me at home if I didn 't do what was \"prescribed.\" Those punishments incl uded being locked in a dark closet for long periods of time, h aving food withheld sometimes for a day or two, bei ng slapped across the face or burned by a cigarette if I resis ted any of the rules. Often I was abused in these w ays, as my mother carried out her own programmed instructions, in spi te of my \"good behavior.\" I was taught to write backwards at the age of four because my programmers felt that I would be more in telligent if I was forced to use both sides of my brain . In addition, I was given special eye exercises to perform several times a day. I began ballet at five and endured years of ba llet training from a perverted ballet teacher named Madame Olga . Episodes of sex rituals and traumas were laced into our dance classes . At times the entire ballet class was abused out behind her little dance school that was located just off Topanga Canyon Boulevard in Woodland Hills. My dentists, the Phillips brothers , had a dental office also located on Topanga Canyo n Boulevard, around the corner from my ballet school. Acting independently of the church, but being friends of my father, they participated in my \"preparation\" by torturing me with sharp dent al instruments by drilling my teeth and poking expo sed nerves without the use of Novocain . Who could have known then that, when I grew up an d married, my \"chosen\" husband would be first \"in line\" to purchase these successf ul dental practices, which is just what happened. After I started kindergarten, my mother informed me that a group of people from the First Baptist Church were going to leave the church and form a new church cal led the First Presbyterian Church of Woodland Hills. In the beginning days, the church met at my elementary sch ool, while we waited for our new church to be built on Platt Avenue. Our new minister's name was Rev. Alden McKelvey , and nothing seemed to change much, except the minister had a different name, we had a bigger buil ding, and now more people were involved. School was somewhat of a respite, but even there I was not always free from abuse. Starting in first g rade, I was taken out of my class at Woodlake Avenue Elementary School (located a mile from the church), to attend 'choir practice' at the children's choir director's home a block from school. Her name was Mrs. Rebecca Muir . At her home, in conjunction with practicing church songs f or performances at Sunday church services, I was tr ained to perform and participate in rituals and was forced to participate in child pornography films wh en a group of men entered her house and took ove r. Snuff pornography where little children or babies w ere killed was also filmed at her house . Like the other women involved, Mrs. Muir, publicl y, a meek, gentle woman, dutifully complied with th e direction of these men. One day just after returning to school from Mrs. Mu ir's house, I went straight to the principal's offi ce. Her name was Mrs. Stella Greer . For some unknown reason, the threats of death if I told were not consciously available to keep me silenced and switched out of the personality who had just witnessed the pornography, and I told her everything I had been forced to do at choir practice . I had seen Mrs. Greer talk sternly to us kids at assemblies and just knew that she was a person of great power who would be able t o stop the bad people from hurting all of us childr en. But, her response was enough to reinforce everything my abus ers had threatened over my young years . I will never forget it. Mrs. Greer's face turned red with anger as she wrat hfully shook her finger at me, sternly warning in n o uncertain terms, \" Young lady, I don't ever want to hear such filth ou t of your mouth again. You stop making up these hor ror stories and get back into your classroom where you belong !\" At that moment, I realized that what my abusers sai d was true. No one would help me. People would thin k I was crazy if I did tell, and I had \" no where to run, and no where to hide .\" I couldn't survive without them and there was no one to help, just like they said. I was trapped. Why this adult woman, my school principal, was unable to logically question how a child of my young age coul d be privy to or know such adult and pornographic l anguage , never seemed to cross her mind. "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Our pediatrician, Dr. Cusack , located on Ventura Boulevard in Woodland Hills, p articipated by suturing up my vagina when it was torn from abuse, and cared for me in other ways when the abuse became to o physically obvious . When I requested my childhood medical records sever al years ago, I was told that Dr. Cusack had moved out of the state and that all of his records had been destroyed . At home in the evenings, while my mother was pick ing up my grandmother from work at Lockheed in Santa Monica, and in the middle of the night, my father continued his own form of tortures ; raping me, sodomizing me, filming me pornographic ally with my brother, submerging me in the bathtub or swimming pool until I was nearly dead, t orturing me extensively at his welding shop with th e use of electroshock delivered through hot welding equipmen t inserted into my vagina, and leaving me outside a ll night alone during rain storms. He also kept dead bodies under our home for his sic k perversions . He tortured and \"trained\" me under the house lots of nights before dinner, and would lock me into boxes and leave me t here for long periods of time, often with body parts from cadaver s he kept. One night he took me to a graveyard and forced me to watch as he dug up a coffin, opened it, forced me i nside and reburied it. I split off more personaliti es. One personality split wasn't enough to handle this trau ma. One Saturday my father took me and one of my dolls out to the old refrigerator that was in the corner of our garage. Quickly, he shoved me inside and clutching my blond baby doll, I begged, frantically clinging to my fa ther's shirt, \"No Daddy! Please don't.\" Slapping my hands away, m y father scolded, \"Now, show Daddy what a big girl you can be. If you try to get out,\" he knelt down beside me , \"Daddy will have to beat you.\" He slammed the doo r shut and I could hear him taping it closed with the black elec trical tape he used on endless mechanical things. W hen I cried out from inside the cold refrigerator, my father angril y pounded on the door, yelling for me to shut up. P etrified in the dark, cramped cubicle, I listened for any sound tha t might indicate that my father was opening the doo r to set me free. Ominous silence prevailed. Feeling unbearably cold and unable to take another breath, I experienced the intervention of three ethereal beings, transparent yet sparkly , misty-blue colored angels who suddenly materialized outside the refrigerator and appeared to reach thro ugh the insulated metal to infuse me with life-sust aining energy . In a transcendent state, it was as if I was held in suspended animation as these angels lent their lif e energy to me. Some time later, when my father came to release me, probably thinking that, like all the other times h e had taken me near death, I would emerge fragmented yet grateful to him for saving me, he checked the pulse on my neck, and finding none, he panicked . He carried my limp body across the garage and lai d me on his workbench. \"Now I've done it, damn it,\" I heard my father say to himself from my out-of-bod y vantage point . \" I've gone too far and killed her, now what am I going to do ?\" Quickly he slid my lifeless body into a black pl astic trash bag, tied it off, carried me out the side door, and placed me in the crawl sp ace beneath the house. The rescuing angels reappeared and one telepathically communicated that it wasn't time for me to leave my family , that I needed to get back into my body and go on up for dinner . Unbeknownst to my father, I still had a spark of life left in me, and God, knowing His plan for my life was not yet complete, fanned that spark until I came back to life. When I reunited with my body, it ached and I felt nightmarishly sick but crawled out of th e bag , wobbled out of the crawl space and walked in a di ssociated state, back into the house where my family sat eati ng dinner. My father looked up at me as if he had seen a ghost and my mother, unaware of any of the \"incidences\" o f the day, smiled and told me to sit down to eat. The trauma and torture was endless, occurring nearl y every day and night of my childhood. The tortures were so numerous that it would require a separate volume to chronicle all those I have remembered so far. Leaving my body in order to 'dissociate' from the pain and continuing to create separate personalities, o ften alongside personalities my abusers intentionally created for their own use, was my mind's way of keeping me alive to function i n the day-to- day world. I had two worlds: one secret world that I lived and knew only when I was triggered into it; and a seco nd, 'normal' conscious world of day to day experiences. These wo rlds were kept separate by the use of trauma and pr ogramming. I was my father's and other people's project for th e future . An investment that provided him access to high-te ch hypnotic information, financial security, and most probably immunity from prosecution for charges invo lving pedophilia, child prostitution, and child pornograp hy. \"He shall give His Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in t heir hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.\" -- Psalms 91:11-12 "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" Chapter Three We’re Off to See the Wizard Common Mind Control Themes Hand signals are a common mode of control for victi ms of ritual abuse and mind control. There was a ha nd signal program I was taught when I was very little, that w as sung to the song Frere Jacques, with the nursery rhyme, Where Is Pointer? The common song/game is played by singing; \"Where is Pointer? Where is pointer?\" And then you put up your pointer finger and say, \"Here I am, Here I am. How are you, today sir? Very well, I th ank you ...run away, run away...\" Then you put your hands behind y our back. I was taught the version: \"Where is silencer?\" With a finger held up to the l ips commanding silence. \"Where is kingpin?\" With large pin inside the middl e finger, that I was poked with just before singing , \"run away, run away.\" \"Where is little man?\" Holding up a pinky finger wh ile singing, \"Little man can't run away.\" \"Where is thumbkin?\" Holding up a thumb and being t humped on the head while singing, \"You can't run aw ay.\" Wizard of Oz In conjunction with the traumas at church and schoo l, my father reinforced my programming with the use of fairy tales, among them Disney themes and The Wizard of O z. I watched the Wizard of Oz every year and at oth er times my programmers laced in other programs and hypnotic commands in a creative way that allowed the movie themes to keep me under control. Although I could not cons ciously remember what I was programmed to forget, t his use of fantasy, used in an effort to keep amnestic and to scramble what I had actually participated in, was v ery effective ...almost foolproof. Sometimes in the middle of the night, after having watched the Wizard of Oz, my f ather would traumatize me in order to cause me to dissociate, w hich created the perfect trance state for programmi ng. In this altered state, he would tell me that \"over the rain bow\" was a bridge to the \"other\" world, and that I could walk over the rainbow bridge into the other world and it woul d remain separate from my everyday world. He told m e that what happened over the rainbow would feel unreal, like a dream. After encounters that I was supposed to forget, I w as conditioned to the word \"home.\" It began with \" There's no place like home \" being associated with being back in my bed , sleeping, after a night of being used in child pornography or prostitution. Later my mother, fathe r, or others would say these words after my use in Washington, D.C. in the White House or other places I was sent under program. For years these words functioned as a way to reorient me back into my everyday world, without ca rrying back with me the reality of what had happene d. I was instructed to, \"sleep and wake up at home in my bed with the Land of Oz so very far away. That place t hat felt like a fairy tale ...that I must have made up ...was only a dream ...was now very far away.\" I was now on the other side of the rainbow and was conditioned to believe that tho se experiences never really happened, that they wer e only a dream. Later in my teen years all it took was for m y mother or father to say, \"Honey, you can sleep al l the way home,\" and I was conditioned like Pavlov's dogs to respond to the word \"home\" with total and complete amnesia of what had just happened to me. If my subconscious mind threatened to divulge the s ecrets, my father programmed me to \"wake and eat ch ocolate chip cookies to remember to forget.\" And for years, the next 40 years, as this powerful programming co mmanded, I awoke out of a sound sleep if memory of this secret world seeped up as I entered first theta and then delta brain wave sleep patterns. Following program, I robotical ly walked into the kitchen to eat chocolate chip co okies in order to \"re-mind\" myself. Another Oz theme that was used to program me was th e song, \" If I Only Had A Brain .\" During a programming session, a man whispered in my ear, telling me, "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"\"It's safer not to have a brain, it's easier not to have a brain ; all you have to do to stay on track is to follow the yellow brick road. Then you won't be scared lik e the cowardly lion and you can keep your heart whi ch you will need to get you down the yellow brick road to the land of glitter and gold, glitter and gold, glitter and gold. Follow the yellow brick road to somewhere over the rainbow way up high.\" In my trance state, this verse went deeply into my subconscious mind and was an evervigilant internal reference to remind me to forget, and could be enforced by any o f my controllers when the need arose to keep me fro m unlocking repressed memory. Alice in Wonderland was used as a theme to program in 'time awareness.' My programmers said, \"See the rabbit who says, 'watch the watch, watch the watch,' and feel your eyes gro w sleepy and tired so you can no longer watch the watch but you know it is always there ticking away, keeping perfe ct time. It knows what time it is so you won't ever have to wor ry about what time it is for the watch will keep pe rfect time. And now at the count of three I want you to wake up ...1, 2, 3...\" he snapped his fingers, \"and awake. Good girl!\" There were other programs based on fairy tales and Disney themes. Other survivors around the world hav e also reported many of these same common themes. Disneyland When I was five years old my mother and father took me to the newly-opened Disneyland in Anaheim, Cali fornia. As we walked down Main Street, we ran into Walt Dis ney and my father stood aside as Walt Disney, large r than life to me, bent down and shook my hand. He told me that if I would write to him he would write back to me. I didn't consciously remember anything else after that. What happened next, though, as I later recalled, was th at Walt Disney looked at my father with eyes that said important t hings I couldn't understand . My father then led my mother in the other direction and I was left alone with Walt Disney . My parents never said goodbye or anything, they j ust left me and walked away. I was terrified and confus ed at realizing that my parents just disappeared. Walt took me to an office, lifted me up on a big desk that had a glass piece on top and told me that he was my real father. He said the Mickey Mouse Club was my real family—where I re ally belonged. Everyone was always telling me I bel onged to a different family than my parents and I didn't understand, it was all very confusing. Walt Disney seemed nice but I wasn't with him very long. He called another man in and that man took me by th e hand and led me away . This man was a very bad man and he really scared me. He took me into another room and gave me those view master box glasses to look into. He showed me pictures in them that were so scary th at other parts of me had to come to see them . It was too much for a little girl to see. Dead th ings--cut up bodies, dead cats skinned with big eye balls and their tails cut off, people cut up, etc. We had tha t toy at home but mine had cartoon pictures in it. This event involved several of my personalities. Next, the man took me to scary rides and poked me w ith needles in my waist and legs while he said thin gs during the Alice in Wonderland ride, like, \"This is not re ally happening. I am not really sticking this needl e in your leg. You are just like Alice . You also ate the large mushroom and feel funny -- this is not real.\" He kept laughing and acting like all this was fun and games and really a musing, but it was terrifying and confusing to me, and I couldn't understand why he was hurting me. Parts of me split off as they withstood the abuse and I pushed the e xperiences deep into my subconscious mind as my programming di ctated. Then the man took me to Mr. Toad's Wild Ride and sexually abused me by taking off my panties an d pushing me up and down on top of his penis while we were going through the dark, enclosed ride. During many years that followed, I got hurt on Mr. Toad's ride. I was inst ructed to be extra sexy and wild and crazy in order to be \"good\" and not get hurt. If I did it right and performed o n cue, then I didn't get hurt when it was over. Whe n we came out into the light from the darkened ride, it was over and if I did it right I could stop and go back to m y Mommy. If I did it wrong, I had to do it all over again until I did it right. They always hurt me real bad if I made a mistake. I tried my best. It seemed like I had to stay at Disneyland fo r a long time, but at the end of the long day, I go t to have a pretty balloon that I looked at as I laid in the back seat of the car all the way home. I was devastated, exh austed and out of it during the ride back to Woodland Hills, but look ed up at the pretty Mickey Mouse ears balloon or th e Mickey Mouse balloon within a balloon, before I finally fe ll into a long deep sleep. We went to Disneyland yearly, often for birthday ce lebrations. On another visit, a suited man escorted me to the front of the Snow White ride . As he guided me on board the boat, he flashed a badge to the attendant and explained"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"that he had special permission to take this special guest on the ride . We entered a boat and rode through the canals while he refrained the fairy tale themes. As we pas sed them by, he stuck needles in my thighs at diffe rent times after he finished a line about a story. All the classic f airy tales drifted in front of us--the Three Pigs a nd the Big Bad Wolf. He told me that the big bad wolf could always find me and get me, even if I was in the well-buil t brick house, and that the wolf could huff and puff and blow my h ouse down. He told me my parents couldn't protect m e from the wolf either because he was big and bad and wild. I can still hear the Big Bad Wolf song playing. The m an kept poking me with the needle and it hurt. I kept watch ing his hand with the needle trying to anticipate t he pain and he kept telling me the scary stories. I didn't know what to do and couldn't get away beca use we were in a boat and I couldn't get off. Then he almost choked me to death in the front of the boat but kep t talking and telling me the fairy tales, as if not hing had ever happened. I was terrified. Later on, in the dark of the night a man in a suit took me on the Matterhor n and stopped the rollercoaster ride at the waterfall where he to ld me everything that happened was washed away and gone forever. He made me get off the ride and stand on t he rocks high up inside the Matterhorn all alone in the dark that night. I was really tired. He said they were leavin g me there alone because I didn't do it right and I didn't listen well. I was terrified in the dark, wet, rocky area that w as whooshing with the sound of the wind and cars fr om the ride speeding by. But it got even scarier when the area fell silent. Cold and tired, I was left totally alo ne for what seemed to my child self like forever. When the man finally came to get me, he asked if I was ready to be good . Then he said a lot of words while he carried me to my parents. H anding me, all limp and wet, over to my mother, he said, \"She's asleep.\" My mother was crying, my father was smilin g and the man in the suit said, \" It's been done, she's now ready for the next level.\" My father carried me out of Disneyland but stopped to buy me a Mickey Mouse balloon to look at, to, as he said, \"remember the good time you had.\" Disneyland was ne ver really fun; there was always pain and torture. Another night at Disneyland I climbed the steps to the Swis s Family Robinson Tree House. Once inside one of th e rooms a man grabbed me, slapped my face really hard and fla shed a bright light in my eyes. He said, \"Your moth er is not your real mother, your father is not your real fath er. You are made of much greater things, so great i n fact that Walt Disney would claim you for his own. So remember wha t I've said about who your real parents are.\" When he was finished with me I climbed down from the treehouse, sobbing hysterically with each and every step. My mother was waiting for me at the bottom and took me over to th e Fritos snack stand to try to get me calmed down. It's A Small World ride was purposefully used to cr eate the reality in my mind that I was really just on a ride at Disneyland when later I was taken to foreign countr ies for use. The programming that blossomed up into my conscious mind after such travel was that I was mer ely at Disneyland. One day my father accompanied me into the international phone display. I picked up many of th e colored phones and listened to the different lang uages and my mom stood close by while my father appeared to walk away. But my father really hid behind the phone di splay and talked like he was sending a message through the ph one. Initially, I thought it was someone else talki ng to me through the phone, someone who mysteriously knew my name. When I caught on that it was my father, I kn ew better than to let on and continued with the charad e. Soon a man in a Disney uniform came and linked arm in arm with me like the characters do in the Wizard of Oz , and escorted me over to the main headquarters near the dog kennels . On another trip, I was taken on the Jungle boat rid e at Disneyland at night. It was very dark and I no ticed that no one was in line as my parents guided me through the area where people normally waited to enter the rid e. We were all alone and I was terrified, anticipating what wa s to occur next. I had learned early on, and knew a t a very deep subconscious level that my parents were of no prote ction to me; instead they were often the very ones that delivered me to very terrifying people, experiences and place s. This night was no different. I was taken to the very back of the boat and a man in a dark suit emerged, and said, \"I will take it from here,\" at which point my father took my mother by the elbow and escorted her robotically away. I w as afraid. \"Laura,\" the man called out. Laura was m y school personality who was programmed to be cooperative an d helpful. He said, \"Laura, I need your help so tha t things run very smoothly tonight.\" \"Yes, sir.\" I replied, now switched to Laura. \"I wa nt you to turn around 7 times and I will be tying a rope around your waist so we don't lose you here tonight.\" I co uldn't imagine how I was about to get lost on this big boat, but I complied as he tied the rope around my waist and as commanded, I began turning as he counted, \" One, two, buckle"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"my shoe, no, three, four, shut the door. The door t o your mind, that is, five, six, pick up sticks, an d ...seven will do the trick .\" I didn't know what the trick was but I was soon to find out. \"Here, now you just sit down right here,\" as he pointed to a place at the back of the boat, while he held o nto me with the rope like I was a dog on a leash. B efore I knew exactly what was happening he lifted me up and plun ged me into that cold, dark water. As I hit the wat er, I was sure that the alligators that I'd seen earlier that day on the Jungle Cruise were going to get me and eat m e alive in the dark. The boat was going and I was being dragged be hind it. I held onto the rope so that I could stay facing forward. Reminding me of the Wizard of Oz programming theme, the man yelled, \"Lions and tigers and bears, oh my .\" Then pointing into the dark water near me, he tapped int o the Peter Pan theme I was also programmed with as he anxiously warned, \"I believe there's an alligator t here on your left, no I mean on your right, right t here behind you, he's swimming right up behind you on your other lef t.\" I was frantically panicked; and in an attempt t o make it all go away I squeezed my eyes as tightly shut as I cou ld, and held onto the rope for dear life. \"You're a very strong little girl,\" he called out, \"just like your father told me you were. You know, the survival of the fittest.\" Then he began to reel me back in and lifted me up by the rope as I climbed over the rail ing to get back on the boat. \"You passed that test with flying colo rs! Your father said that this test would be easy f or you.\" I felt numb and my teeth were chattering from the cold. My dress was all wet and so were my shoes and socks a nd panties. I was freezing. My father always did talk to me about the 'survival of the fittest' and how I would be strong. \"You could fly like Tinkerbell does, across the sky at night attached to this rope like you are. Shoul d I leave it on so that you can fly with Tinkerbell tonight, high up i n the sky?\" \"No, sir,\" I replied looking down at the rope and s hivering. He laughed real loudly. \"You know that you fly with her every time you see her fly; you fly high, high away from all the things you think you remember here, but non e of those things really happen; they are all just figments of your imagination. Do you know what figments are?\" I shoo k my head no. \"Figments are fruit that you eat. And you have enjo yed all the rides here tonight and had a lot of fun and now it is almost time for you to go home. You know, like Mick ey says in the song, \"Now it's time to say good-bye to all our company, M. 1. C. K. E. Y. M. O. U. S.E.; you know the song on TV, the one that you hear when you watc h the Mickey Mouse Club? \"Yes,\" I said, now in total hypn otic, robotical program. \"When you see Tinkerbell and all the beautiful fire works here tonight, you will remember the good and only the good things that happened here today and tonight. A ll the good will float up into your conscious mind just like Tinkerbell flies high in the sky, so will all the g ood things [that happened] fly high up into your co nscious mind. You have had the best day here at Disneyland and wa nt to return as soon as you can for more fun.\" In a complete hysterical panic, my mother rushed up and threw her arms around me as if she was rescuing me. She thre w some sort of dark cloth over me, and she and my father t ook me off the boat. She took me into a bathroom to change clothes near the Jungleboat ride. My mother ushered me into a stall and began changing my clothes with out closing the door behind us. I was embarrassed. A lady came into the restroom and my mom said to her, \"My daugh ter fell into the water and we are changing her clothes.\" No wonder it has been difficult, at times, for me to trust my own awareness, even as an adult. One night, my programmers decided I was to actually replace the real Tinkerbell in flight over the par k at night in the dark. The men in park uniforms walked up behind the real Tinkerbell who was actually an older lady and this night she was in costume, ready to fly. The men tol d her to step aside, that I was going to fly that n ight. I didn't know where my mom and dad went and I was cold and s cared. The woman was very angry. She wanted to do h er job and yelled at the men but they told her just to relax, that she would still get paid and that no o ne would have to know she didn't fly and she could go home early and still collect her paycheck. Still angry she left a nd the men dressed me in a white Tinkerbell costume and strapp ed me into the flight harness. After I was secured, a man asked me if I was ready. He showed me where to hold onto the front straps so I wouldn't get my hands or arms ripped off while I was flying high above the Magic Kingdom. Th e whole experience was terrifying. They must have g iven me a drug because everything appeared to be in lots of pictures like a camera with a whole circle of lens es of the same picture, like a kaleidoscope. As I flew, I felt afr aid that I would fall out and splat below on everyo ne, but after a little while I became numb. I could no longer think or feel. I must have fainted because when I got to the other end"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"of the sky ride, a few men removed the harness and tried to get me to come to. One man slapped me but that didn't even wake me up, then someone else put smelling sal ts under my nose and I woke up. I don't remember mu ch else except I couldn't walk very well and had to be carr ied out of Disneyland. That night there were no sto ps on Main Street to get toys or a balloon or candy. I felt si ck and laid in the back of our old Buick until we g ot home. My brothers didn't go with us, it was just my mom and dad and me. My father said I was the 'star' of the family. I didn't like being the star if that's how it was, but he se emed very excited about it. Twin Sister Programming My neighbors, my \"second mother\" Mary and her daugh ter Peggy, took me to a Hollywood theatre to watch The Parent Trap, a 1961 Disney Movie starring Hayley Mi lls. The theme of this movie helped to shape the re ality of my inner \"twin sister,\" Sharon. I was Susan and my twi n sister was Sharon. This Sharon personality was cr eated in an attempt to further split my mind and was anchored w ithin my personality structure in order to house a vast reservoir of experiences with the elite. Sharon was to identi fy herself with \"high society.\" Now of course, my inner twin sister Sharon also had to have programming experiences at Disneyland . To accomplish that our neighbor Mary took me to Disneyland with her daughter Peggy , who was my age . At one point we visited the beautiful Magic Castle that is located in the middle of the Magic Kingdom. As I w alked through the Castle, exploring the area, I rounded a corner and as I stepped into a darkened area, a man in a b lack cape that had been hiding in a dark corner of the castle step ped forward and grabbed me. He put his hand over my mouth so I wouldn't scream and he elbowed me in the stomach be fore he raped me. Then he took me in the direction of the dog kennels in the front of Disneyland where other bad things happened. Every year, Sharon had to watch th e \"President Show with Lincoln\" that played in a theatre on Main Street and in order to keep her secret experiences hidden from her conscious mind, this twin sister part of me als o had to be exposed to many of the same kinds of tr auma. Sharon was created to be Catholic, and Mary and Peg gy often took me with them to Catholic mass. (They didn't know about my connection to Henry Kissinger.) I was taught about Holy Water and genuflecting and the S tations of the Cross and Confession and Hail Marys and saying the Rosary. Peggy let me borrow her rosary beads th at had a little blue enamel picture of the Blessed Mary on i t. I learned to say, \"Hail Mary full of grace the L ord is with thee,\" over and over again for each bead. We always had to wear a hat or a scarf. They had a lot of rules you had to follow. Had to get that Holy Water and dab it on yourself a t your Stations of the Cross; forehead, heart then each shoulder, before you genuflected upon entering the pews. Then we knelt down and said the Rosary for a very long time. With my childlike consciousness, I thought it was a dumb thing to do and kept asking everyone why we had to say that and what it would do, but all everyone ever said wa s that I asked too many questions. During the many times I attended mass with Mary and Peggy, I silently praye d to the statue of the Blessed Virgin and asked her to help me, although I was unable to \"think\" about why I needed help. Sharon was a \"child of the elite\" and later on, serviced t he elite, such as the Rockefellers . She was often the sexually-oriented personality when I was used for s ex and mind file work. \"Sharon\" was my highly sexua l counterpart and \"Sue\" contained the messages in min d files. To further my split conditioning, there wa s a small stone building in a cemetery where the men in suits locked me in for the whole night. They took my clo thes away from me, pushed me into the dark room and closed th e door. It was cold on the concrete floor and I cou ld feel spider webs in the corners. It was scary, so I just sat do wn on my feet in the corner, hugged my legs to my b ody and closed my eyes. After awhile, an angel appeared . She said her name was Maria and that I was being prepared for the future. She said that she and other angels would help me and I would be \"sustained.\" I didn't know what that word meant but felt like it was okay because I felt so much love f rom her . While my spirit self was sitting next to her on a b ench , my physical body was still in that concrete room . She told me she would be very close to me later whe n I was older and could understand more . She explained that these people were unkind because they didn't understand, but that my angel friends loved me very much and would be th ere whenever I needed them . All of a sudden, before I was ready to leave her, I was back in the cold concrete cubicle, still sitting squatted on my feet and she was gone. I felt like I had traveled somewhere and I wanted to go ba ck there because it didn't hurt and wasn't cold the re, but I couldn't figure out how to get there. I had to wait for the angel to escort me. Everyone was always es corting me"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"everywhere--on earth and in heaven. When the men ca me to let me out, it was still dark and they droppe d me off at home. Entering the breezeway, I went through the ba ck door, into my room and went to sleep. The Golden Arches Now of course, in order to insure that Sharon's mem ory was kept separate from my conscious mind, traum a had to be induced to create the dissociative barrier. Amon g other traumas, I was taken to St. Mel's Catholic Church in Woodland Hills and was molested by a short fat \"Father ,\" at the back of the church in a side room. This p riest who spoke with an Irish accent and smelled like alcohol , pulled my hair while he sexually satisfied himsel f in my mouth. When he was finished with me, two men in suits escorted me to an awaiting limousi ne . I had short hair and wore a felt poodle skirt, flats, white socks and a white b louse. It wasn't unusual to see limousines lined up in front of this large Catholic church for use at funerals or weddin gs. It was nearing dark and once out of sight of th e public, these men were very rough with me. They threw me into the back seat and once inside the limo I laid on the s eat in a fetal position, rocking myself, terrified out of my mind. Arriving at the new McDonald's , one man told me, \"Look at the Golden Arches, they are your Highway to Heaven. Whenever you enter to cross over, you won't remembe r having been here.\" I went in as Sue and after I w as drugged I came out as Sharon. I had no awareness that Sharo n was me. In my internal, subconsciously created re ality, I believed Sharon to be my physically separate, twin sister, but consciously I had no knowledge of any o ther part of me except Sue. All I knew was there were lots of ti mes when I was told that I would be allowed to see my twin sister, my secret twin sister. I felt sad. I missed her desperately and I felt that she was always in danger and needed me. The man who was present to create this part of my p rogramming was a very affluent and locally well-kno wn and respected Catholic OB/GYN doctor, named Dr. McGinnis . He told me that I could find my twin sister in th e bathroom, so I ran there to find Sharon. The doctor and another man followed me as I ran into the smal l one room bathroom that I entered from outside McDonald's, in tears desperate to find my twin sister. Once insid e, as directed, I looked around and came out and told the doctor th at he could come inside, that there was no one else there. I felt very robotic. Entering the small bathroom with me, he locked the door behind us and told me to sit on the floor in the corner of the stall. I did as he instructed. He took my arm and put it up on the toilet lid, slipp ed a rubber cuff around my arm and got a big needle out. As he injected the drug into my arm he commanded, \"cou nt backwards from three .\" \"One...\" I started. \"NO!\" The doctor yelled angr ily. \"I said backwards, starting from three.\" \"Thre e, two,\" I slumped over and passed out. He began slapp ing my face and I couldn't wake up but he called ou t, \"Sharon, Sharon, Sharon.\" Finally after lots of slapping, Sh aron said, \"Yes.\" \"Get up and walk out to the car.\" The doctor commanded. Sharon obeyed. He carried his black doct or's bag and we took off as soon as he got into the limo. I overheard him say to the driver that if he ever got caught he would just take his black bag and say he was on an emergency, that way no one would ever question him. We drove down Ventura Boulevard to a jewelry store . The doctor and I went in, myself still switched to my t win sister Sharon. He told the store owner I was lo oking for a present for my mother, but I wasn't really. These people always told lies . He put a diamond bracelet on my arm and said, \"You're used to jewels, remember?\" \"Yes,\" I said, smiling. It was true that Sharon was used to riches. \"That is all you need to remember, that you're used to jewels.\" As we turned to leave, he called out to the owner at the other end of the store to say tha t we were finished shopping. Next, I was dropped off at a big house somewhere and taken downstairs to be filmed in child pornography. There were men in leathers and chains with guns. A man ripped my clothes off and sodomize d me while another guy watched as it was filmed. Then I was chained up, whipped and filmed more. The y liked it when I cried out . They said I had to, in order to make a good film, but I really wanted to be quiet and keep all to my self so it would ruin the film. They put a baby on a wooden table and killed her wh ile I was being raped and they said her lifeblood w as filling me and that I liked taking the baby's life into me . I didn't really. I didn't want them to hurt the b aby, ever. But I had to smile and laugh while they filmed it or they said I would be killed, also. They made these snuff films often with babies or little girls. \" The younger, the purer,\" the men said . They believed fetuses were the best to get the pu rest untouched lifeblood. They often ingested the flesh afterwards, and somet imes the heart, while it was still beating. It was terrifying, vile and disgusting . And they fed it to me for the filming. I was alwa ys forced to smile. After it was all over I was taken by limo back to McDonald's, in to the same bathroom where some man snapped his fin gers in front of my face and said, \"Susie, you've fainted,\" which, by calling out that name, switched me back into my"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"conscious personality. Once revived, these men drov e me to my street, dropped me off and told me to wa lk the highway to heaven into sleep. In program trance, I walked the short block home, went through the breez eway into the back door, and climbed into my bed. It was dark outside but the yellow porch light was on and I kn ew my way through the house with my eyes closed. That night, alone in my bed, I said the prayer I us ually said with my mother or my grandmother each an d every night, \"Angel of God, my guardian dear, to whom His Love commits me here. Ever this day be at my side. To light and guard, to rule and guide.\" I beg of you, dear r eader, to be open to the possibility that these sor ts of atrocities did happen, and that they are still happening to other children today, even right now at this very moment. Please open your heart and know that this could be true so toge ther we can all put a stop to the abuse that terrif ies and threatens to destroy the children. McDonald's was often a par t of my abuse whether I was in California or later away from home when after use in different states or countrie s, they took me to \"The Golden Arches\" and gave me coke (later aspartame-infused diet coke with a twist of lemon) and French fries. McDonald's was a very powerful program for repressing events of national and international usa ge. The Foundation is Built By the tender age of five, 1 was conditioned throug h torture and high tech hypnotic tect and electrosh ock, to hurt myself in many ways should I begin to remember the secret activities, was a part of. Per programmed su ggestion, if I began to remember I would stub my big toe c burn myself on the stove, thereby removing my focus from the remembered secret experience and re-routing my atte ntion to my wound. I was instructed where to cut my wrist in order to take my own life, should I begin to rememb er or tell. There were also accident programs insti lled t insure my death if I began to remember. Endless programs w ere installed into in my life that were available f or later use in suppressing my hidden activities. Over the years, I was told the following while I was being tortured, in an~ you remember, you will kill yourself; if you tell, people will think you are crazy and will lock you up in a mental institution; if you don't obey us, we will kill you r family or your dog and cat if you tell, we will k ill you.\" I had witnessed killings for years and knew these were no t id threats. My programmers also created within me, reporting pe rsonalities that were instructed to tell on me in r egard to anything I did that was stepping out of line. This common feature of mind control is reported by many survivors. \"He called a little child and had him stand among t hem. And he said: \"I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter t he kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven .\" -- Matthew 18:2-4 \"See that you do not look down on one of these litt le ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.\" -- Matthew 18:10-11 Chapter Four Uncle Charlie, Kissinger, Hope and their Little Pup pet. My Inner Twin Sister, Sharon Weatherby I was paraded in many circles as a child, as Sharon Weatherby, and sitting on the fringes watching me was my Uncle Charlie. He told me that he would always be t here, rain or shine."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" Uncle Charlie was always at my father's Aunt Maude's when we wen t to visit her, just dad and me. He would be waiting for us on her little couch with the lace co verlets, the sheer curtain behind holding a green c hameleon lizard that I thought was real until I got older. All deck ed out in a tan suit, his Dapper Dan shoes and a ca rnation in his lapel, Uncle Charlie smiled, shook my hand and wink ed at me. If he had on glasses, he would take them off to mak e sure I caught the wink and that was my cue to keep the secret . He told me before that it would hurt my father's feelings if he knew he wasn't really my father so I shouldn't ever mention it. \"Otherwise,\" he said, \" it would likely break his heart.\" I sure didn't want to hurt my Dad dy anymore than he already was with his neck injury , slipped disk and parents who abused and didn't love him. And he loved me so much, unless he had to hurt me. Uncle Charlie said, \" Unfortunately he has to do that to make you powerfu l one day .\" So when I met Uncle Charlie with my father the first time, I never let on that I knew him. Lat er Charlie said, \"Young lady, that was the finest a cting job I've ever seen. You're hired!\" Well I was \"hired\" at a very young age, but was nev er paid a cent. And Uncle Charlie was my representa tive, come to take me to meet first, Bob and, soon after, Henr y. Sharon was indeed programmed to be precocious an d one day reported the following joke repertoire to Henry and later to audiences Bob and Henry sent me to: \"I to ld my owners, it's enough that you clowns expect me to work for f ree. You know it was bad enough that they broke the child labor laws and I told them about that when I learned it i n school. They just laughed. But on top of that was SLAVE LABOR, and I recited the Constitutional Amendment t hat was causing a problem in my internal mind file legal systems. I told Henry it kept getting thrown out an d I pretended it was repeatedly escaping and leapin g out of my right ear. He thought I was funny and told me to re file it anyway - then I was sent off for more recon ditioning. I never thought they would stop with that stuff and I was right. Zap, zap, zap.\" These were the type of jokes that Bob Hope programm ed into me for shows when I was demonstrated to oth ers that had similar mind control \"interests.\" The first tim e I recited it to Henry for his approval, he raised his eyebrows and looked at me over his glasses; he usually seemed ei ther pretty amazed or leery at the jokes Bob instal led into me. I was too young and too fragmented to have come up wi th this type of material on my own. In later years when people would ask Bob where I came from, Bob jokingl y told them I was picked off a conveyor belt. He al ways teased about where I came from. Bob told me once th at he chose me because there was that little someth ing special that he saw in my eyes. Henry created my personality system and Bob handled the dialogue, jokes, songs, dances, and entertainm ent, and supplied Henry with famous friends and connections from all over the world, including Hollywood celebr ities and business and political connections. Henry said cont acts were everything, and that he and Bob worked we ll together because, despite their differences, together they m ore than doubled their influence and efficiency. Th ey did wield influence over a large group of people. Henry had t he mind and Bob had the means and the connections. Creating My Inner Universe Henry worked with me more in the beginning to set u p all my systems. He even marked my forehead all over with little x's delineating what he called a \"stellar ma p\" of my system . Then he had me look into the mirror and what I saw, in addition to my little five or six year old face, framed by short hair, was black x's all over me. He said those were planets within my inner universe of knowledge and that they were laying in wait for the day they would be occupied. Later he attached the foreign countries, using It's a Small World for the different planets. This kept the information totally separated since the planets had no way of communicating with each other. So all th e information remained self-contained but held in orbit in the bi g blue vastness by stars. All the stars were used a s mind files for different movie \"stars\" or politicians I was used w ith. The larger stars held larger files of personal ities I was used with more regularly and the smaller stars were rese rved for people I only saw on occasion. The largest stars were reserved for Presidents, Kings, Queens, etc . The Council , that all-powerful group of men secretly orchestrati ng this whole drama, had very specialized, highly advanced satellite systems that traveled all over inside my mind , constantly monitoring my internal \"worlds .\" They could also access interstellularly or interpla netarily and gain access to any information they wanted about any are a or person in the system . Council members were the only ones who didn't have any security blo cks throughout the system anywhere . They had full and total access like Henry .

Henry just didn't inform Bob ab out planets or stars he didn't want him to know abo ut. And Henry told me that he and Uncle Bob rode on little space cycles all around inner space in my head in order t o police everything and make sure everything was always in p erfect order, with no file on any planet or star ev er getting out of order or loose. That way Henry kept my mind file s in perfect order. Henry told me the mind files are limitless because the universe is limitless and contains an i nfinite vastness, always new areas to chart. Henry said it could never be full . Kissinger And Ever More Sophisticated Programming Kissinger was the mastermind behind my personality structure , and used others to further his creation. He was usually inside the top security places my father an d others took me. There they did all the \"prep work ,\" they called it, before I was taken to Henry for his expertise . Prepping, to me, meant torture in machines, chair s, all sorts of horrors and then, when I couldn't function any long er, didn't know my own name, or if I was even real, they would take me to Henry. Henry had a notebook of diagrams he worked from. A \"distilled\" diagram meant that th e original idea and intent had been identified and worked out, and the succeeding diagrams were a further refinem ent until the end result was total perfection. That's how Henry c reated my personality structure. Mind control was a secret weapon that he perfected over the years. Henry had other \"robots,\" as he called them , but I was the one with whom he spent the most tim e perfecting. He said I was the perfect subject and that my father h ad done such a great preliminary job that his work was guaranteed a success, where other robots fell short because they \"bled through\" and so couldn't be relied upon . I knew Henry had other robots because he said he had them for va rious and sundry things but said that I was the cre am of the crop. Henry said we had a \"roving headquarters,\" and that was always his black briefcase. When I saw his bri efcase I was programmed to feel familiar, and my surroundings di dn't matter. I could now do my work knowing that ev erything was okay. At least that is what was suggested for m e to think and feel. As I grew older, I was taken to military bases for more sophisticated programming . Helplessly hooked up to high tech machines that d id things to my brain, I had no way of understanding what these people were doin g to me or why. I was placed in large metal chamber s and left in isolation, sometimes spun, with colored lights, always with only one color at a time. I was restrai ned in sophisticated chairs with electrodes attached to my head, then electro-shocked in a variety of ways. S ophisticated audio equipment also was used on me. Often loud, pi ercing sounds were relayed through earphones, usual ly with different sounds being fed into each ear. I didn't know what exactly they were accomplishing with all of this technology, but I felt tortured by it. Mind File System I also continued to be taken to Disneyland for base programming for my government mind file system. At around 8 years old, Henry made up some clever programs to cr eate a place and organization in my head for my int ernational mind files . He created within my personality system one or tw o children for each nationality; as is similarly portrayed in It's a Small World ride at Disneyland. Henry said the international themes were to anchor in different mind file systems that he said were \"culturally ori ented.\" Around The World In 80 Days was a song I sa ng over and over again when either my mother or my brother play ed it on the organ or my brother would play it on h is accordion. The words I was programmed to respond to were, \"Around the world in 80 days, I traveled on when Hope was gone to make my rendezvous...\" Henry Kissi nger and Bob Hope continued to be cohorts over the years and played around the world with people and governm ents, as much as that song played repeatedly in my head. Henry linked a whole array of different programs to the It's a Small World ride and said, \"When you wa lk up to the clock you will hear it tick-tock and then you will dock; ticktock, ticktock. Keep all information sepa rate. Keep all information clean and neatly in its space with litt le walls in between.\" I walked up to the ride, and saw the huge clock tower going tick-tock, then I was told to fil e through the turnstile until I got to the ride. He nry meant for me to think my actual trips abroad were really just memor ies about this ride. Due to this programming I had trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy. Disney fantasy was really meant to hide my international experienc es from my conscious mind . Once I got off the ride Henry said something hypnotic to me to lock in the program. He spent a good part of the day with me at Disneyland. He was really funny to the personalitie s he was programming. I almost laughed when I first saw him. I knew it wasn't allowed, but he did look really funny in the disguise . He had on a beard, wig and hat . He looked"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"okay, but I knew it was really Henry, and so I said , \"Henry, why are you wearing those silly things?\" I couldn't comprehend why he needed to pretend he wasn't himse lf. In his thick-accented, deep, monotonic voice, h e told me to be quiet and with irritation in his voice said, \"You, my child, are too precocious.\" Henry put me o n ride after ride, and after I got off the rides, dizzy, nauseated, li ghtheaded, disoriented, frightened, or whatever, he told me to \"listen intently,\" while he programmed all sorts of things into my mind file system. \" My Name Is Henry Sims \" Henry bought me popcorn and a balloon, too, just li ke my parents did in order to lock in the program. If people had known that Henry Kissinger was there at Disneyland that day, they would have been very surprised. And if I were the cause of him being recognized, I would surely h ave been terminated. I was never to allude to being associated with Henry Kissinger. Henry gave me a lot of mixing up on that agenda by having me read \"Henry books a nd cartoons,\" in his attempt to keep his identity anon ymous to my conscious mind. He attempted to scrambl e my association to him by having me read a variety of b ooks; one was about Henry and the donut machine. He was always whispering, \"My name is Henry Sims,\" in my e ar, so no one else could hear him. He also had me e at \"Oh Henry\" candy bars and read \"Oh Henry\" cartoons , after he'd given me a hypnotic command to wipe aw ay all memory of him while I was reading or eating the abo ve. Sometimes Henry would drive us to a parking lot , where we got out and walked some distance to a shopping c enter or a waterway. Each time we were together, he usually wore a different type hat (sometimes a Dick Tracy o ne) and a stick-on mustache and/or beard. He used t o have a square mustache and a square goatee to match. He wo re those off and on. Henry was a master of disguise and could keep his roles straight . He seemed very smart to me as a child. In the early days, Henry would tell people, \"She's a smart cookie, isn't she?\" That was when I was abo ut 10, just before my big political White House sexual liaisons were to begin. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Carousel Program Henry also programmed me in front of a carousel rid e. He had me stand in front of the carousel but he wouldn't let me sit down on a horse or a bench on the ride. I wa s only 8 years old or so and I wanted to get on the ride and have fun, but Henry said I had to stand up outside of th e ride. That day, the carousel in my mind had to be created with me standing up and the files in my mind were to gli de smoothly and as easily as the carousel turning. Then it would come to a stop, like the wheel of fortune, at the c ountry in the mind file that Henry would ask for. H e told me, \"There's a whole other world in your mind files, th e whole world.\" Then he told me, \"The carousel make s the files in your head turn easily and effortlessly.\" My prog rammers also linked memory of times I was spun unti l I was dizzy and disoriented in their attempt to keep thes e mind files under the cloak of national security. As I deprogrammed I often mentally bumped into spin, sle ep, suicide, migraine, and drug programs that I had to fight through in order to get to the original experiences . I was often physically sick, as my program dictat ed, and suffered massive migraine headaches and pain in different pa rts of my body while retrieving this information I' m sharing with you. Henry told me, \" You are a computer and like magnets repel , if you try to work on a computer, your mind will re pel . It will go away and you won't be able to think to o perate it . That is of course unless it's \"apple blossom time ,\" which was a cryptic reference to New York. Later he progr ammed in \"cherry blossom time,\" as a code for JFK. In 1991, some 30 years later, as I attempted to document my memories on computer from the island of Kauai, I wa s continually frustrated, as I would become disorient ed upon starting to write my remembered experience. Often after I tenaciously battled my way through the journalizi ng of my memories, I would smile having won, only t o become immediately disoriented, and look again the next mo ment to find that the information I had just spent one to two hours documenting had been erased by another part o f my personality structure who was still following the ordered command of my controllers. It was extremely frustra ting, but I was stubborn and refused to give up! Inner Clock Program Henry programmed in reporting personalities so he c ould use them to debrief me in order to access the data he carefully requested I acquire on certain targeted i nformation or individuals. He created a very sophis ticated system that allowed me to have an inner clock that not onl y kept perfect time but, when asked, I delivered th e time audibly, and also knew the times around the world and could even record and playback the time that events occur red for me each day. Henry would ask me, \"What did you do betw een the hours of 8 and 5 on June 5th?\" I would reci te, \"At 8"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"a.m. I woke up, at 9 a.m. I took a shower, at 10 a. m. I saw so and so...\" At anytime Henry could check the inner record to find out where I'd been, who I was with, and what I was saying or doing. He instructed the s et-up to house, \"who, where and what,\" and be able to enter \"the sc hedule recording file\" into the framework of the ba se program. My most important job was to drop the message to pe ople he sent me to, at the right time . Henry said timing was everything . So he taught me to drop messages at the perfect tim e and to look into the person's eyes and notice oth er facial mannerisms and how he or she was breathing . He said I would get it like \"perfect clockwork.\" That was the actual name of a mind file category, to list and re cite all the different world times so Henry would k now exactly what time it was in each and every country in the w orld anytime he would ask me - and all this time an d place orientation looped back into the It's a Small World ride and the Clock Tower programming. Henry could remember file names and numbers better than anyone could. He always remembered the major ones all in his head. He had a small notebook where he kept track of othe r mind files ; large lists for intricate blueprints, classified documents, and detailed listings under s ubheadings. The system of files he created was multi-leveled an d multi-tiered, like a wedding cake . Henry told my respective personalities how it loo ked overall and created a picture in our head so we could see how it worked from insi de. We also had an inside \"teacher\" that we could h ear inside the head to teach, remind, command and organize. This teacher was important and worked inside subcon sciously and separately with Henry, until I was thirty-six o r so , when a chiropractor inadvertently connected my cons cious mind up to my inner teacher, who later ultimately h elped lead me to freedom . The result was that Henry's inner teacher program was made conscious and I was taught to my conscious mind what was previously subconsci ous, thus, my conscious and subconscious minds were link ed together making the program even stronger and ac cessible to learning information from others. So, I was then consciously able to realize I was assigned my \"inn er teacher\" and \"inner guides,\" who really were just code names for projects or areas I was involved in. Then, I b egan to hear the codes consciously and it was activating subcons cious personalities or material in my mind files. B ut once again I am getting ahead of myself. Chess Anyone? Henry played games with me; chess, checkers, tic-ta e-toe, and concentration; all mind games \"to create other files and nooks and crannies to store files,\" Henry said. He set up a system with a chess game that was inte nded to house cryptic messages between Henry and others. The Council contacted Henry and built a very strong relationshi p with him through lengthy discussions and information the y sent to him through messages encoded in my mind f ile system . Over time, Henry wooed them by creating very sophis ticated (yet simple for the intelligent) ways of co mmunicating through the coded chess game where each piece had a very specific meaning that he taught me to memoriz e in order to relay the code. Over time the secret players kne w what the moves meant by heart. They were time wor n. \"You see the chess board like a clock and all the pieces are recognized in a clockwise motion,\" Henry instr ucted me under his hypnotic command. When the chess board was set up, all Henry (or the Council) had to do was to mak e a move on the chess board and I would memorize and carry t he move, containing the cryptic message, back and i t would be understood what was meant by the communication. Uni lateral wars were directed; the players in the game of war were clearly demarcated. There were no mistakes bec ause everything was programmed and cross-checked li ke a computer. My mind was programmed and catalogued lik e a machine, so there could be only absolute precis ion. The chessboard was a bridge to the \"other world\" wh ere my controllers all existed, \"like when Dorothy went to Oz,\" I was told. Henry and Bob and Governor (later Presi dent) Reagan and the others were to be seen like Do rothy's friends and family--they existed over the rainbow w hile my mom and dad and friends were where Auntie E m lived, in the real world. \"So just like in the mirror, eve rything is just the opposite of what you see. Like Sleeping Beauty looking into a pool of clear water and seeing her b eautiful reflection, you will go over the rainbow, melt into it.\" \"Over the Rainbow\" was always going toward the worl d that was like Oz, that pretend world of Henry Sim s and Bob. Everyone was on the other side, all I had to d o was \"walk through the liquid mirror to face the o ther side and that will immediately switch you and turn you aroun d to face a new situation, calm, refreshed and invi gorated. Every move, smooth and efficient,\" Henry instructed me. The Older Look"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" Henry created many personalities inside of me who w ere programmed to be older and wiser than my young years, for his use with others. These personalities were f ormed and created by watching different selected mo vies as a child, like My Fair Lady. This was necessary, I ove rheard Henry tell others, in order to use me at 10 years old, passed off to others as a 16-18 year old. Since I w as physically developed by 10 years old, they could pull it off, especially by creating very mature personalities to handle some of their very important clients. By th at time I began having my hair done professionally once a week. My hairstyle was short and \"chic,\" was the word Henry used. He needed to provide me with an older look and, in tho se days, everyone needed me to be older looking, ol der acting, older everything. My hair was professionally styled every week, in order to more smoothly portray the very mature, polished personalities that he and others helped cr eate for their use. One obstacle was during the tim e I had my braces on. At that time, there were occasions when I would be taken to my orthodontist, James Mulick , DDS., a UCLA graduate, and late at night, he would remove my front braces and then a day or t wo later after my use was over, he would replace them . Like everyone else, he was probably also under prog ramming. In those days, Henry accessed information from my m ind files with needles that he stuck in between my knuckles, though never in public. When we were at a meeting o r in a public place he just touched my hand to put me into a mind file mode, then he would cue me with key/code numbers to access the specific files he wanted. Lat er, he used a \"time clock theme\" and fortunately for me he aban doned the use of needles. Over time, many personali ties were specifically created and enhanced for future use wi th targeted people, such as presidents, entertainer s or foreign leaders. There were \"president mind files\" that wer e created strictly for the President's use in whate ver way they needed or wanted. I was instructed to wear pearls f or times I was to be used strictly as a mind file, and diamonds when I was to be used primarily sexually with presi dents, heads of state or world leaders. I can still hear Henry's voice giving me the comman ds, with his thick heavy accent he said, \"Your eyes are getting so sleepy a train wouldn't rattle you. Now when you are deep asleep you will be able to retain vast re servoirs of information for safekeeping and retrieval by me and only me. This information is safe, very safe, beca use it can only be accessed by me. Do you understand? Nod if y ou understand.\" I nodded my head. \"Good,\" he said, \" now we can begin with the taping of the message , 'Mr. President, I was aghast at your stance in Iran . Change directions and face east . The success of this operation depends on it .' \" Other memory compartments he created for other usag e were seen to me, inside, as blocks of memory bank s that housed information. They all had combination locks that Henry knew the codes to. Many had number and l etter codes like, \"16R, 17L, and 12 up straight.\" With the access code, the door to the memory bank i n my head would swing open wide and I could go in and read the info rmation Henry wanted . He told me the file to go into and I'd read through the alphabetical mind file system to g et to the subject he wanted. Then, I read him the d ata or accessed messages directed to him from others. Later on when I was older, I had numerical codes for laundering money to and from places he told me to go. UCLA Henry spent time at UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute in Westwood, California, in the area where they te sted me and worked on my brain with all of their high tech equipment; bright lights, goggles, drugs, electrosh ock, cat scan tubes, etc. Henry walked with the big, heavy Caucas ian doctor dressed in a white lab coat down the hal ls and I walked behind them until we got to the double swing ing doors, and then the doctor held one door open f or Henry and I to enter. We all went inside and Henry told m e to hop up on the table. The doctor examined my re flexes and looked into my eyes with different lights and gave me tastes and smells and all sorts of things that t hey said would powerfully effect my brain. Henry told me the docto r was my imaginary friend. He told me that was what I was to think, anyway. In an attempt to further scramble my brain the big doctor crossed his arms over his che st with his hands pointing in opposite directions and said, \"Is it east or is it west? I don't know, I just get co nfused.\" NASA Another time doctors in white coats played perceptu al mind games with me at a NASA installation. First they took me \"through the course,\" they called it, and I was taken from chairs that performed different operatio ns, like one that spun, then next to an isolation chamber. They put huge eye machines up to my face and had me clos e one eye"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"and then the other in order to program each side of the brain separately. Some things were then revers ed and programmed into another area of my brain through th e opposite eye. They called this \"cross-programming .\" For other functions, both sides of my brain had to be o perating syncronistically. Information for mind fil e use was stored only on one side of my brain. Then, they all owed me to rest a moment before they injected me wi th some drug after which they put me through the course aga in (first by a woman, then by a man). They led me f rom each piece of equipment by the hand because at this poin t I was a total zombie. When I finished the third g o-around of the course of equipment; they put me in a totally s oundless isolation chamber. I don't know how long I was in isolation, but doctors in white lab coats released me and asked me questions. I was still spinning; I felt like I couldn't even prevent my head and eyes from continu ally spinning as I attempted to answer their questi ons. Focusing my eyes was very difficult. I can still fe el and experience, to the point of abreaction, how awful and disorienting it felt. The doctors always acted very superior, but even as a child under mind control, somehow I was able to wonder, \"who couldn't win with mind games, under these circ umstances.\" I was only a child who had been put thr ough torture and drugged, and now they wanted to ask me questions as if they were somehow better than I was . After one doctor finished questioning me, he would leave and another doctor would question and test me further. At the time I was unable to consciously fathom the fact that that there was never any normal life for me. Only \"acti ng\" normal outwardly and for the public. Normal was what most people deemed acceptable behavior and I was told to emulate the normal people. So I copied behavior and was onl y allowed to be around certain people. All other re lationships were not allowed. Both my mother and father watched me \"like a hawk;\" they said I wasn't allowed to go to social events that were not part of my programmed reality. Henry Got Me into the Pentagon Lots of Times In order to ready me for this assignment , Henry played \"a bingo game\" with me inside my head and directed me to the files in the Pentagon by a map he also created ins ide my head. In the Pentagon file room a code identified each fi ling cabinet in the room by giving it a letter code for the row and a number code for the number of the cabinet, starti ng with # 1 at the left. There were 12 rows of 12 c abinets in the area. The floor beneath the cabinets was smooth con crete or marble-like. The files inside the cabinets were labeled with letter and number codes. You had to look up th e document you wanted from a listing, to get to the code number in order to look it up in the files. These w ere kept on the opposite side of the building for s ecurity purposes so a person would have to break through two securit y systems to get to the document they wanted. None were just filed alphabetically, but had a different system al together for security. The building's windows had t hose small wavy, wiry lines in them. But the file room didn't have any windows. There were different types of sec urity systems. Some systems set and unlocked with cards, others wi th keys, and still others were heat, light, voice o r pressure activated . In some areas there were red laser beams that shone through the area that housed the filing cabinets. There were many times that he dressed me in different disguise s; dressed me as a man, complete with beard and mus tache, or a woman with padding to make me appear heavyset . These disguises were also successful in making me appear different ages. He often had hats that completed my disguise for a job. Henry disguised me and took me in one night. He only did the night entrance on one occasion, whe n there was an emergency that was worth the risk of abandoning me inside with instructions to self-dest ruct if apprehended . Henry did something to get an armed guard to agree to take me through the long, gray halls an d lines of desks to the area where they had rows of file cabinets full of classified documents. Henry needed some information on a document , so he said something to the guard and the guard took me all through the building unlockin g systems as we went. He took me up to the file roo m and just like in the game Henry and I had played, I went str aight for the file cabinet, coded in the row and nu mber on the map in my head. Like a rat in a maze, I knew my way exactly to the desired destination and I used a sm all flashlight that Henry had given me for this purpose. The file area had cameras that filmed the area, like in bank s. Those had to somehow be shut down. Henry told me to pull the file, photographically memorize its entire contents within a prearranged mind file and minutes to completely \"ph otograph\" a multi-page document with my mind . There was no, enough time to read it, but I photographed it quick ly, and then I returned to the guard . I think the agreement was that I could only have 2 minutes in an open drawer once I located the document I think Henry challenged guy s that thought I couldn't do such things that fast or othe r things than seemed humanly impossible, so that he could get me into different highly secured buildings Henry also palmed guards and at other times got special cleara nces, or would work a deal out with a guard or the guard's boss. I t was tricky because guards had to log their Henry would help provide them with an alibi for the time they were h elping him. "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"During regular business hours, Henry would prostitute me to top Pentad, guards, whoever he needed to manipulate or access in order to gain the information he wante d There were certain Pentagon officials who were more cooperative than others. In later years he took me to meetings with men at the Pentagon in order to \"d ebrief' me in front of them. At the Pentagon there was also an au dio-visual room, as they called it back in the late 60's and early 70's, where persons with top clearances could go to see a movie (later videos), of top secret projects and other classified information. Henry got me in to see lots of those over the years. There used to be a large movie screen, but later a large monitor for video showings Henry and The CIA Henry sent man,: at the airport in a limo. Once in the office, Henry sat me in the large wooden chair that turned, r, order to give me the message while he spun me. Late r, I was driven with him while he sorted through my mind files, listened to messages from people, and inputted info rmation on new projects until we reached Washington , D.C. Then he sent me into buildings and I gave the infor mation to whomever I was told to and in whatever wa y Henry said. Most of the time se, was just an avenue to de liver messages or maybe just used as a payoff to of ficials who were willing to overlook their security command in order to allow me access to certain classifies area s. Henry was well greased into the inner network of the FBI and CIA . He and his groin made sure they had control over these agencies. The director was always \"one of theirs, \" but Henry had a lot of important information to g ive these agencies in order for things to groove, like well-o iled cogs. They sent me to \"give a message to the m an on the second floor in the hall who has a rep handkerchief in his left pocket and bumps into your left should er and leans over to say, 'Sorry little girl.' Then you tell him this message.\" Henry had a lot of business with the CIA and the FB I and it was all a big secret. He sent m, in even a t eight and nine years old to deliver some of his most sensitive inf ormation to the most sensitive of connections. It a ll began with him spinning me in the wooden chair and inputting t he message. Then he would have someone deliver me t o the destination where I passed off information, often to older, very dign ified, wealthy looking gentlemen . Sometimes I \"ran into\". cute little old man with white hair who bumped me on the shoulder and dropped somethin g on the floor like a rose, handkerchief, or key ring and as we bo th bent to get it, I'd deliver information. Sometimes it was a long string of numbers and sometimes just a word like \"A jax, or \"coma,\" or \"barley him \"or \"make him into a ham on rye,\" or \"tonight, 3 a.m. Federal Building job .\" Chain Of Command My chain of command was Henry first and then Bob. H enry Kissinger created Sue and Bob Hope created Sha ron, and initially they were to only work with their res pective sides of my personality structure. Messages could be sent through the inner personality system. Bob was never to access Sue and Henry wasn't to access Sharon, b ut Henry taught many personalities how to send messages back and forth through the system in order to get infor mation about Sharon without accessing directly through her and t hereby keeping it secret from Bob that he was break ing their agreement . Henry created \"inner runners\" that took messages from Sue to Sharon and then replied back without ev er having to have Sharon present . It worked well, but Bob didn't access Sue. Since Bob didn't create my personality infrastructure, he lacked the sophistication to kno w how to access information without being caught an d he knew Kissinger would find out because Henry programmed m e to always tell the truth. I couldn't do otherwise and I would tell on Bob because Henry told me, \"You watch him and tell me everything he does.\" After lots of contact with Henry, he said, \"Like in a good marriage, after awhile there is unconscious communication going all the time.\" He meant that it was like knowing each other so well that you know each other's thoughts, and that's how he trained me to be attune d to him. In the early years lots of my instruction s came by way of the telephone. My controllers would call out a s pecific personality's name and I would switch to he r, listen for instructions and when they said, \"Bye Sue,\" I'd swi tch back to my regular personality, with no conscio us awareness of the event. Bob took me to more places as a child to gain experience, but Henry just sat me in the c hair a lot and read instructions or stuck that big pin in my thigh or hand, and gave me things to look at to \"take a picture with my inner camera.\" Who Would Suspect a Kid? "},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Henry had his driver take us to different parks in New York and they would let me out. I was eight or nine years old one time when Henry told me to, \"walk toward the ma n in the blue suit,\" and when he dropped his handke rchief I was to give him a message. When I walked back to th e car, Henry said, \"You're some kind of homing pige on.\" He called me that often when I was little and doing \"e rrands\" for him. He wanted me to have short hair so he could disguise me to look like a boy or a girl, whatever the job required. He had me be everything including \"invisible\"-- that is, hidden inside of a box that was transporte d into a large warehouse. Of course I was instructe d that once inside, to wait two hours, get out of the box and c ome and unlock the warehouse, and if necessary I wa s instructed in how to break the security code to get out. Like Henry said, \"Who would suspect a kid?\" \"Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us...\" --The Lord's Prayer Chapter Five Initiation into the Political Arena as a Sex Slave My father sold me as a prostitute to neighbors and business contacts . He programmed me to ride my bike to the gas station at the corner of Ventura Boulevard and Fall brook Avenue in Woodland Hills. Mr. Teesdale and Mr . Roberts owned the station. Frank, the auto mechanic and gas station attendant who worked there, traded my fath er free gas and auto servicing in exchange for having sex with me in the bathroom at the station. That went on for several years. The gas station has since been demolished an d in its place stands a large office building, but the memories of what happened to me remain. He also took me to the next door neighbor, Mr. Faciano, to perform sexual favors, always in exchange for twenty dollar bills. My fath er also sold me for sex to groups of men who met at the welding shop he owned. These men took me by the hand, behin d Smitty's Wood Lot, and sexually abused me (I perf ormed oral sex, or they would rape or sodomize me) in exc hange for cash paid to my father. My father, and later my brother Rick , who through a series of events ended up owning th e family welding business, sold child pornography out of the shop . These pornographic materials were kept behind a c orrugated metal wall and sold to interested customers when they came in. (My brother may not be consciously aware of his criminal activities.) Ove r the years, I was well trained, through trauma and sexual abuse , in line with the technology that was shared with my father so he could condition me for a higher level of future use. One night at the dinner table my father announced that the actor , Robert Taylor , had been in to visit him again . I never knew why a famous actor like Robert Taylor wo uld want to visit my father at his welding shop, bu t even though I couldn't yet piece the separate parts of m y mind together enough to understand, I was impress ed nevertheless. During this time when I was around 8-10 years old , my father told me that Robert Taylor watched a ballet performance where I danced the Swan Lake ballet on toe shoes . I wore a pink sequined leotard with pink sequined straps and the outfit had pink feathers attached to it. I had a pink-feathered headband that made it l ook like I had pink feathers all around my face, like a swan. Late r on I found out that Robert Taylor liked child pornography ; my father sold it to him from his welding shop, and he also liked sex with 7-10 year old girls. This was an important time of deciding just how far I would \"go.\" Dad wanted me to go all the way to t he top. He said he was so proud of me and together we'd make h is father Ivan, a proud grandfather. My father had a group of pedophile friends with daughters my age. They trade d us sexually and each independently participated i n filming us pornographically, sometimes including bestiality. I had many personalities who were trained both in po rn and prostitution. Corbin Bowl "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"At age seven, I was further trained by older women prostitutes in a back room at the Corbin Bowl, located on Ventura Boulevard in Tarzana, California. I was taught the \"tricks of the trade ,\" most of which I already knew from years of sexual abuse. The prostitution and pornogr aphy I was a part of was a highly organized activit y. There were times a personality within me was progra mmed and used to entice and kidnap other children o ff the street and into a big black car . The kidnapped children were initially kept in cages in back rooms and then used in pornography and usually killed, often in snuff film s . We were all shocked with cattle prods or other el ectrical devices for lots of different offenses. Pornography was filmed at the Corbin Bowl, with other children , women, men, and animals. Perhaps this is where many of the missing children, whose faces we see so often on p ostal cards or billboards are disappearing to and why they are never found. At this young age, I was also locked in a small, da rkened room with a bed and sold as a prostitute to large numbers of men in a day. The people in charge left ropes, w hips, and sex toys for use by the men who paid for sex with me. One of my father's pedophile friends and partners i n the child porn and prostitution business was Dean Hartshorn . Although Dean was nearly 20 years younger than my f ather, their shared sexual perversions kept them cl ose friends. Dean and his family lived in the Encino Hills area and he operated a pesticide business. Dean had a beautiful daughter, named Donna , who had the blondest hair and bluest eyes I'd eve r seen. She was traded to my father for sex and I was traded to Dean and some of his friends and relatives. The Hartshorn family joined my family on vacation several times a year and Donna and I were filmed a s we performed sexual acts with numerous different people. Other Locations Over the years I was taken to many different locati ons and filmed and/or programmed. Some of these wer e: Turlock Lake, Mount Shasta, Clear Lake, Lake Arrowhead, Bas s Lake, Lake Cachuma, Lake Isabella, Millerton Lake , Pine Flats, Lake Elsinore, Big Bear Lake, La Jolla, Miss ion Bay, Salton Sea, Coronado, San Juan Capistrano, the Colorado River, Lake Mead, Lake Mohave, Lake Havasu , Death Valley, Las Vegas, and other places we went for so-called \"water-skiing vacations.\" Cliff Spear was also a pedophile friend of my fathers . His daughter Debbie (also known as DeeDee) was my age and was in my brownie troop and class at school. I was traded to Cliff by my father, and was moleste d by him every time I spent the night at Debbie's house . In the middle of the night, Debbie and I, and som etimes her younger sister Jana, were awakened and taken to Cliff's carpeting business to be filmed pornographically. Guy Cooper was a man who filmed me in porn at his home in Hidden Hills, with his younger daughter , Buffy . In this porn I was also forced to have sex with animals, some of them large farm a nimals. You can imagine how shameful and degrading these experiences are to a child. To my knowledge, my father's affiliation was not li mited to any single group, nor did he subscribe to membership in any group for any length of time. Instead, his memb ership was temporary, as he moved from one group to another, suiting my programmer's needs for the time. The groups I am aware of that he attended for diffe rent periods of time were the Lions Club , Ku Klux Klan , and Neo-Nazi groups. Publicly and consciously my father adamant ly professed that he was not prejudiced against any ra ce or religion and taught me not to be racially pre judiced. In private, secret gatherings with likeminded men, he witnessed and participated in ceremonies where they humiliated, tortured, dismembered and killed Black people and J ewish people. I know, because as a child I was pres ent at some of those \"meetings.\" I was taken often to rituals that were performed late at night. One incident th at stands out in my mind was a night near my 10th birthday when a group of men sacrifice d a Black man, saying it was done in my \"honor,\" to give me power. As I watched in sheer panic, devastation, and horro r, they tortured and then threw this man alive into the bonfire . To withstand this extremely traumatic event, I sp lit off another personality to deal with it. On ano ther occasion, as a Fourth of July event, a small child was delivered by a black sedan to my father at the gully at the end of our street. I watched in horror as my father str apped a homemade bomb he had made to this little bo y's body and told me he was so powerful he could make the child live or die. The next thing I knew the bomb went off and the child was nowhere to be found . The tactics used to keep me dissociated and split were endless. "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The Shriners I remembered my father and our Shriner neighbor, Jack Rice , taking me to a meeting where a group of men, all wearing red Shriner hats, sat at tables. My father was given a Shriner hat and acted like he felt unco mfortable wearing it. I was patriotically wearing a navy blue v-neck dress with a large white sailor collar. Mr. Rice sat on one side of me and my father on the other. They ate din ner but I just sat at my place in a daze and didn't eat anything. One of the Shriner's stood at his table and clinkin g his glass to get everyone's attention, he announc ed, \" We have a little member here tonight to entertain and delight you . Please welcome her with a round of applause.\" I walked up onto the stage and began dancing to The National Anthem. \"Oh say can you see, by the dawn' s early light,\" the words played as I danced and slowly beg an taking off first my dress, then my shoes, pantal oons, nylons, bra, and panties until I stood dressed only in a ti ny tasseled white satin g-string. Why I didn't stri p all the way I don't know. All the men cheered and after I was through Mr. Rice stood at the bottom of the stage stairs to take me backstage to dress. He held out his arm and I took it. I felt like I was blind and couldn't see to fin d my way so he led me as he recited the program he had continually tau ght me to memorize, \"There was a man who had no eyes and he went out to view the skies, he saw a tree with apples on it, h e picked no apples off but left no apples on it.\" It was a \"blind\" program and I was told I couldn't see while I was there . Mr. Rice led me to a back room. It wasn't like a dressing room, just a side room. He gave me some kind of red robe to wear, \"They'll bring your clothes on into us in awhile, we'll just wait.\" Other nights at different Shriner places, there wer e satanic rituals where I was raped on an altar in front of the group of robed me n . There were many other Shriner meetings; lots of t hem disguised \"under the big top,\" at Shriner circuses. Circuses were a place of trauma over the years and I usually ended up getting hurt . My neighbor Peggy and I performed Alice in Wonderla nd in what seemingly appeared to be an innocent bac kyard neighborhood play for these elderly neighbors, Mr. & Mrs. Rice. They sat on their patio, having cockta ils like they always did at happy hour and watched while we perfo rmed. In the middle of the play, Mr. Rice wiggled h is finger and calling me over to him, he said, \"Come here, Su sie, I want to tell you a secret.\" I stood by this elderly man's chair on the patio and he motioned for me to bend o ver so he could whisper a secret to me. His pungent alcohol breath permeated the air as he said, \"I have a litt le surprise that will help you act out the play bet ter,\" and he put a small role of lifesavers into my hand and told me, \"open your mouth for the next surprise.\" Naively an d with complete trust, I opened my mouth as he said, \"Clos e your eyes for the hidden surprise, and remember t he real surprise is in your hand.\" Then he reminded me, \"op en your mouth for the hidden surprise.\" In childlike innocence, I kept my eyes closed, wait ing in anticipation for the surprise. Mr. Rice plac ed something in my mouth that was round as he said, \"This is a heav enly wafer, my dear, a hidden heavenly wafer, in wh ich you will appear.\" I didn't know what he meant but I began fe eling very weak and funny inside, just like Alice i n Wonderland did. Then he said, \"Go finish your play now and act your part. Your part is about to start, so don't b e late for a very important date or you will end up in trouble over a nd over and over again. Always obey the white rabbi t, follow him inside for he has the time of day in which you will play. So go now and play your play. Which is it, p lay? The play or the play?\" In a confused stupor, I walked back over to my frie nd Peggy and entered the play again, saying my part , which was, \"I'm late, I'm late for a very important date.\" Mr. Rice was my date at other evening affairs with the Shriners, some where I was even the \"altar girl\" but it wasn't lik e a sacred ceremony at the Catholic Church, instead , I was taken to satanic rituals. They were really bad rituals where I was raped on a n altar in front of lots of Shriners late at night, in dark outside places and they hurt and tortured me i n the name of what they called, \"the holy one. \" Peggy and I also performed The Parent Trap for the Rice's. This was a way of cementing and concretizin g the Susan and Sharon twin sister programming. I played Sharon in the backyard play and Peggy played Susan. We ev en cut my dress just like in the movie. As I remembered wh at had actually happened, in full detail, instead o f merely recalling the small slice of conscious reality of t his past event, I could smell the Rice's home, Mr. Rice's alcohol"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"breath, and his daughter Joanie's perfume, which wa s strong and also had an alcohol base to it. Hidden behind all the fairy tales and seemingly good things were pain ful memories of the places I was taken to for progr amming. The Onset of Puberty I began puberty around this time and my father snuc k into my room like he always did at night. He explained to me while I was in a haze of sleep, that I was of the s uperior race , that I was of Aryan descent and that he was proud of my blond hair, green eyes, and fair skin . At the time, I had no idea what he was talking ab out and ignored it, pretending I didn't hear him. I started menstruating at ten . This heralded abuse in rituals which involved bei ng raped and impregnated, sometimes twice a year. When the fetuses were two to three months old , they were aborted at rituals and ingested by member s of the group in order to fulfill the beliefs of the group ; that it made those participating \"more powerful .\" These were devastating, deeply traumatizing, and soulfully pai nful experiences, the memory of which was repressed along with all the other traumas. These traumatic events serve d as mind control reinforcement, to insure amnesia of my use in pornography, prostitution, and later projects I was to serve in. By the end of the 5\" grade, when I was almost eleve n, I had gone through puberty, was fully developed and had already had my menstrual cycle for a year. Despite the abuse, I was programmed to be an average studen t, with many \"school\" personalities who helped me act like a \"normal kid.\" Often I displayed behavior problems in school, as I acted out, due to what was secretly going on a t home and at other dark, hidden places. My teacher s merely passed off my joking and constant disruption as typ ical mischievous behavior and I won an award for cl ass clown. I also had personalities who were totally amnesiac of any of my abuse who were able to function normally at school. As I entered junior high school, I did the things t hat normal kids do; I was a cheerleader, performed in the chorus, sang solos at school performances, won awards for t he most beautiful smile and for being the class clo wn, and obtained other awards for service. And my mother ha d the cleanest house in the neighborhood. To all outward appearances, all of these families I 've mentioned, seemed to be normal, upstanding citi zens of the community . NO one would have ever suspected that, in secret, all of this abuse was occurring. The mothers kept clean children and clean houses, smiled and were po lite and caring in public, and the fathers acted ch arming and were considered responsible businessmen in the comm unity. What went on behind closed doors--that no one wante d to believe or hear about, not even my school princi pal--was the spiritual, physical, and emotional dev astation of many, many children . In my desperation to obtain help or understanding, I started very early trying to figure out what was wrong. I kept bumping into mind control programming that re-route d my thoughts, and exasperated with my statements a nd questions, my mother constantly \"re-minded\" me from her own programming, \"You just think too much!\" When I turned eleven, my father announced he was fl ying me to his small hometown of Correctionville, I owa, to meet my grandparents. I was surprised by this invit ation, as family problems had estranged my father f rom his parents for years ...in fact, from even before my b irth. My father never had anything pleasant to say about his parents. But I was excited to fly on an airplane (w hich I mistakenly thought was my first time) and cu rious about meeting my grandparents for the first time. The tel ltale fact that my father hated them, and had stole n their car and run away from home at fifteen never entered my thou ght processes. Nor was I able to wonder why my moth er and brothers were not invited to go along. Unfortunatel y, due to the mind control I was under, I did not h ave the ability to question or to wonder about anything along certa in lines. I merely went along with what I was told to do I was impregnated several months before we were to go to Iowa. My mother took me shopping to a clothes store called Stardusters. It was like Hollywood there. The sales lady picked out dresses and took me into the dressi ng room and, in spite of my embarrassment, dressed me in outfits complete with accessories. My mother bought me sev eral expensive outfits, complete with hats, belts, purse s and fancy, frilly undergarments, although she wor e old, ragged clothes and at home the word was that we were broke . On the way home from our shopping spree, my mother took note of my maternally pooching tummy, and over the next few months, yelled at me constantly saying, \"H old in your stomach.\" Neither of us consciously kne w that I was pregnant and I tried my best to hold in my tummy. D uring my teen years, I was usually anorexic, very t hin, and"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"didn't eat much, so the fact that I was pregnant fo r a month or two was not easy to detect, especially to those who wouldn't have ever expected it. My paternal grandfather , Ivan Charles Eckhart , was a Jersey Ice Cream manufacturer , a multimillionaire and mayor of the town of Correct ionville, Iowa, where he lived with my grandmother . Later on he won a landslide election to become th e supervisor of the Third District and for years wa s involved in both local and state politics. My pater nal grandmother, Leah Eckhart , was a small but angry-tempered woman . Now I understand why Instead of sleeping upstairs i n the plush bedroom with my grandfather, she slept in the bare cement floored basement on a small cot . At the time I could not question or wonder about that either. My grandparents are now both deceased, left with never having the opportunity of understanding or healing the intergenerational abuse that created this problem to begin with. I had many traumatic experiences on my visits to Io wa. I suppose, back then, my father's return visit to his parents appeared just to be a family reunion, but nothing c ould have been further from the truth. While in Iow a, I had the first of several forced abortions, which was perfor med in a torturous fashion by a local doctor. Although I was actually raped and made pregnant at a ritual, I was humiliated and shamed for becoming pregnant . As in all trauma- based mind control, everything was a double-bind. I was blamed and shamed for everything that happened , none of which I ever had any control over. My baby, which w as not yet old enough to be born alive, was neverth eless a perfectly formed fetus. My grandparents and my father performed a ritual be hind their house in which they convinced me that I had killed my own baby (it was obviously born dead), and they ate it and forced me to participate . Since I was suffering from Multiple Personality D isorder, this traumatic experience, along with many others, was stored neatly away from my conscious mi nd, hidden in alternate personalities, and sealed a way from my conscious awareness by programming that covered and hid the truth of my life. One night after returning to my grandfather's house , somehow the experiences that terrified me were no t so neatly hidden from my consciousness and in an act of panic and desperation, I frantically tried to phone my m other to ask her to help me. Overhearing me, my grandfather grab bed the phone out of my hand and proceeded to rip t he phone out of the wall and in retaliation, tied me to the post of his iron bed frame for two days, while they went out of town. My grandfather was very brutal . But my father was very proud of the human technol ogy I possessed. He was pleased to be able to show his father all of my \"tr ained\" abilities. During the remainder of the time we were in Iowa, I was forced to entertain my grandfather's business and political friends. I danced naked on the table at meetings and performed sexual favors for many of my grandfather' s associates . To demonstrate my abilities, my father prompted the men to use their cigars or cigarettes to burn m y vaginal area as I kneeled before them. My father wanted to demonstrate that I would smile and show no signs of the pain due to mind control. After these meetings , I was connected to a higher level of politicians. From th en on, when my father took me on our yearly trips t o Iowa, I was slowly connected to more and more political figures . In the meantime, he used me wherever he could to get cash, or more often, courtesies for favors. We started havin g enough money to go out to dinner, which was a tre at we could not previously afford. It's likely that some of the money came from my father's payoffs from my use in porn and prostitution. Training Farms There were child and adolescent training centers ca lled \"farms ,\" that I believe were located in Montreal, a city in the French Canadian Province of Quebec. I was taken to one for \"grace training,\" and to step up the etique tte and formal training I would need to be used a notch higher. Other teenage girls were also there in training. It felt like a prison . I think I was there for a week - it was difficult to determine the actual span of time. It had to be win ter because it was chilly and windy outside, and the trees were barren and there were leaves on the ground. This place wa s located out in the countryside. It wasn't on the way to anythin g so if anyone came near they could easily be ident ified as intruders. We were seen to public eyes as unwed mothers . We even had to stuff a pillow in our pants and go i nto town every once in awhile . I slept with other girls in a white farm building that had cement floors and cots with mattresses that lined the room. We all compliantly took the medicine they gave us every morning. The p eople that worked at \"the farm\" changed daily, men and women b oth, but never the same ones two days in a row. We ate dinner and we all got into bed, then someone told u s a story. They treated us like a herd of cows and we all tota lly obeyed instructions; there was no fuss and no fight , just total obedience . I was taught how to walk elegantly with a book on m y head and had to be able to squat down without dro pping the book, and then stand up again. I was assigned to wo rk with language input tapes in a small sound room equipped"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"with headphones. I was given a mirror to look into to practice making certain sounds. All the instruct ions were given to me auditorily, even down to, \"hold your mo uth like you are saying A or O,\" and then I heard t he sound I was to mimic. Once I learned the physical impressions of how to m ake the sounds they could easily attach language sk ills. I don't know how it all works, but later they had me lay do wn with headphones on while they played sounds so f ast that I couldn't hear the words. Later they said that it ha d \"worked,\" and that I had received French language enhancement. The lady explained that in most foreign countries i t was proper to ask for a translator, but it was to be common background for the upper class to at least speak fl uent French and Italian, and preferably German and Russian also. Since I was going to be used with foreign people an d in foreign countries, I had to know their languag es and customs. I was also shown movies from a film projector onto a screen. I saw films on different foreign countries in order to obtain the necessary culture . They instructed me, \"Put this in your China file, \" and then I would watch a movie intently recording all of it, the places, the names , dates, historical facts, everything. Then later o n when Henry and I arrived in these foreign lands, I was familiar with their cultural background so I wouldn't make a fau x pas. All we did at the training farm was eat lightly, sleep and learn; input was ingested in large quantities for later use. Henry didn't visit me there. He said he might stop in to check on me, but he never did. Beforehand, he tied my Wizard of Oz programming to this event when he told me to bel ieve, \"I left my bed in Kansas, and went on the win gs of a tornado to the farm.\" When I came back \"to Kansas\" I woke up in my own bed in California and was very, very sick. My mom took care of me and told me that I had the flu. I had a high fever and was a little delir ious. I couldn't even manage to keep my eyes focused. I felt exhaust ed and so sick that I couldn't sleep, so I lay in m y bed and prayed to die. During summer vacation one year, Mr. Rice , our Shriner neighbor, re-introduced me to his daugh ter , Joanie Rice , who was visiting for the summer from her home in Wh ite Plains, New York. She was much older than I and was very attractive. She wore lots of makeup and jewelr y, and wore a heavy perfume called Royal Secret. Du ring that time, my maternal grandmother who lived with us had to be put in a rest home and my mother visited her every day, so Joanie, stayed to babysit me and played with me by our pool in my mother's absence. It all looked l ike a nice arrangement from the outside, but her presence was planned to further my programming. She taught me to be \"dignified .\" I heard that word over and over and over. She ta ught me social etiquette--to act polished, to have good manners, and she was there to voice-program me when the men came with the equipment. At these times, s he and a group of men held me down on the couch, drugged me, placed a band around my head, which they retrieved from a black briefcase full of special equipment including bright lights and machines which delivered differe nt sounds and instructions. I was given names of politicians and programmed wit h instructions that, when I saw them on TV or heard them on radio, I was to become completely amn estic of who and what I was involved in . She also programmed me from lists of numbers and codes. Othe r years, I was flown to her glamorous apartment in New York. She escorted me to Washington, DC at first, s o I wouldn't feel afraid or alone and could work at my maximum capacity. My mother and I also began to wea r Royal Secret perfume, like Joanie. Twenty-nine Palms My family bought property in Twenty-nine Palms, Cal ifornia and built a small cabin on the desert land. One weekend my father explained that my mom needed a li ttle time to herself since her mother had just pass ed away. I, too, was sad that my grandmother had died. My contr ollers told me she went to the streets of hell as e videnced by the blood coming out of her face. She died of high blood pressure, which caused the bleeding. But they said she went to hell and I hoped she would come back alive so we could re-route her. But after awhile that did n't scare me because I knew my \"Gram\" didn't go to hell. Althoug h in a programmed state, my grandmother participate d at times in my abuse, I knew she was really a nice quiet, ge ntle woman, who like my mother, never would have in tentionally hurt anyone. So, my father took my brothers and I to our Twenty- nine Palms cabin and one day they involved me in a sex ritual. They got me drunk, then stripped and tied me by my wrists and ankles face up in the sand in the intens e desert sun. They seemed so excited as they did this to me. My father painted a satanic pentagram and green swa stikas on my body . Later on, as it began to get dark he poured gas i n a wide circle around me and once it was really da rk he lit a match which started a fire burning all around me . I thought they were going to cook me. They put a half-dead,"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"sandy, horned toad in my mouth and told me to hold it there . My brother Rick was running all around in an excite d frenzy and my brother Jim was there also. At this ritual, in addition to traumatizing me, they were being ta ught how to be in charge. I was raped by all of them and their friends . My Future Marriage Was Arranged In 7th Grade During this time, I attended Hale Junior High Schoo l, which was located directly across the street fro m our church, the First Presbyterian Church of Woodland Hills. It was at Hale, in the 7'\" grade (we were thirteen), that I met Craig Ford (Robert Craig Ford). One afternoon, my mother picked me up from school and I introduced Craig to her. After Craig left and I got into the car, my mother announ ced, \"That is the boy you will marry.\" I laughed an d asked her how she knew. She said she just knew. I never quest ioned further. Craig asked me to go steady soon aft erward. Over the next several years, Craig and I were \"bond ed\" to each other through cross-programming and sha red trauma to insure that Craig was under sufficient mind cont rol to later serve as my \"handler.\" A ritual at the First Presbyterian Church served to seal our bond, and so on other more sophisticated means of programming we re utilized. White Programming Vans Large white vans with men in suits in the back pick ed us up at differing locations in Ventura and Oxnard, California, and directed us into the back of the va n. Specialized equipment in briefcases and other la rger equipment in the van awaited us. They routinely beat Craig in front of me to demonstrate what a weakling he real ly was and how powerful and in control of me they were. They w ould slap me around in front of him, as well, to sh ow him how powerless he was to help me and how much in control they were. Electroshock was used on both of us, fi rst by inserting and activating an electric prod in my vag ina and then delivering the same to Craig on his pe nis. We were forced to watch in a dissociative, trance state as the other was tortured and traumatized as they readied us for programming. The bond that was formed by shared trauma was profo und. It created subconscious feelings of being in this w hole mess together and enforced the feelings that we wou ld never be able to get out . After they had sufficiently worn us down, they strapped us into sophisticated chairs an d hooked us up to electrodes. Tones were combined w ith electroshock in order to create access cues that ga ve them quick and easy access to us both later on. Hypnotic suggestions and love songs were presented to us, in order to facilitate our \"falling madly in love.\" I n fact my controllers created an entire system of songs inten ded to invoke selected, preordained feelings toward Craig and others. The list of songs was added to and cultivat ed over the years depending on what attitudes and e motions they wanted to create within me. These songs were some o f the strongest measures of control and literally c reated what I thought were my own feelings about Craig, but which really were contrived feelings created to support the interests of my controllers. Combined with scenarios such as this, my brothers and their muscle-bound friends wo uld intercept us when we were parked after a date to ki ss. They pulled Craig out of the car and beat him u p as they instructed him not to touch me sexually. Then one o f them would rape me in front of him as they restra ined him nearby, rendering him once again powerless to help. All these conditioning experiences served to \"prepa re\" Craig to robotically deliver and hand me over to other men , then step aside while I passed messages or servic ed them sexually. It was always his job to make sure I was delivered to the right place, at the right time, to the right person, and for many years, that is exactly what he did. I didn't have sex with Bob Hope until later. Bob sa id the wait would do him good, \"give him something to look forward to,\" and then he would lean down and poke m e and do that ole' softshoe dance. He did that ofte n. He said, \"I like my fruit ripened, not plucked before its ti me.\" At other times he would say to his friends whe n I was around, \"See, I know how to pick my fruit, huh?\" Then he'd say, \"Hey kid, get me some grapes,\" and I'd go get them and he would show off how cute and efficient I was. He was always showing off my new acts. He would say, \"Do your Coca Roca dance.\" So I'd do a dance. Then he would say, \"No, the other Coca Roca,\" and I'd take off my clothes while dancing. Or he would have me sing I Enjoy Bei ng A Girl, which was a song I sang for a junior hig h school performance and later for him and others. The Theat er in the Round was built and opened in Woodland Hi lls and drew large crowds to watch the live action plays th at were performed in the round theater. I attended the plays often and it was there that I was prostituted to Bob's friend , Sammy Davis, Jr. It was a brutal event that I \"forgot\" about as soon as he was through with me."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" \"Love suffereth long, and is kind...\" -- 1 Corinthians 13:4 Chapter Six JFK and the Sex Shuttle During a demonstration of the high level of technol ogy available to those willing to join the ranks, Henry masterfully delivered a slide presentation of the m ind control technology . I sat in the darkened room in \"park mode,\" with my conscious mind seemingly blocked fro m the information, yet carrying out the command of my master to perfectly record all that went on around me. First Henry flashed a slide of me in my normal California life . He said, \"Who in their right mind would believe that this ki d was having sexual relations with the President of the United States ?\" The men agreed. Then he followed by a series of sli des of me artfully made up, dressed formally and in different disguises. The men were amazed at the difference. Many men were brought into the cause simply because they wanted to own a piece of the rock and have their ow n robots to do their work or create their pleasures : At first they were given just bits of information at a time, to d etermine if they would be cooperative . Then they were given a little more information to test the waters to see i f they were ready for the final blow . Usually dozens of meetings occurred on superficial levels before any real info rmation was given out and that was only released wh en the men were \"deeply committed,\" which meant that they woul d be compromising themselves or their family if the y backed out at a certain point . In the beginning when Henry was cultivating my rela tionship with JFK and insuring him of my security g uarantees, Henry didn't fill me with much of an agenda except to give JFK the \"royal treatment,\" which meant the same as Bob's (Hope's) full smorgasbord of sexual positions and favors. Henry told me to carefully note everything JFK said and did for debriefing afterwards . Henry had a challenge with JFK because as he said , \"he's so damn self- initiating,\" and so Henry couldn't have me take the lead, thereby slipping in comments intended for He nry's covert purposes. So for awhile in the beginning, he just let me be with JFK so that he would get used to me , and Henry said, \" Then a plan will inevitably open up .\" Kissinger didn't spend a lot of time with JFK. T hey spoke but it was like they were \"... polar opposites and constantly repelled each other ,\" Henry said. But Henry, and especially Bob as the front man, got to JFK and paved the way for his acc eptance of me. Once we were in, then Henry started strategizing heavily. That is what happened after I began having sex with JFK. Henry said, \" Mind files were created to delight the young president .\" As Kissinger counted on , JFK was a romantic and seemed to get caught up in many of the messages I delivered to him . The messages made him feel good and Henry wanted him to feel good and powerful with me. I was delivering high level Council messages created by Bob and Henry , that Henry instilled in me to deliver to \" John-Feeee ,\" that's what I called him. They got a war underway through JFK , a big war that was to influence not only America but also the international climate . It was as common for foreign dignitaries, heads o f state, senators, congressmen, governors, and other leaders, to ride the Lincoln Memorial (Oral Sex) Tour , as it was for them to get their shoes shined in the local hotels. In fact, that was one o f the jokes I was instructed to deliver to get a ma n loosened up. I was programmed to say, \"Want your shoe shined?\" The n I would unzip him and begin. There were lots of m en who wanted further servicing later on, but I was instru cted to refer them to my boss. I serviced many men on this so-called shuttle servi ce over the years of my life that should have been filled with junior high, high school and college extracurricula r activities of my own choosing. The elitists I worked for had an endless supply of slaves that kept the tour shuttle running regularly . I wasn't really giving tours, just sex in the limo . The men felt safe and protected from public exposur e by their placement in the back of the limo becaus e they couldn't be seen due to the security windows. They had privacy when they exited the limo so they would n't be exposed. Security employees would always await the arrival of the shuttle limo to open the door and co ach them out when the \"coast was clear,\" then transfer them imme diately into their own personal limo so no one woul d ever"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"detect. There were times when Henry would have a dr iver take us from DC to his office in New York. He would work with me in the back seat after he told the dri ver, \"I'll be busy working and I don't want to be i nterrupted.\" So the driver shut the window between the seats and He nry would debrief me and take sketchy notes, draw d iagrams and plans while I was talking or he would touch his finger to my forehead and start uploading me for f uture assignments. Much of our work took place like this on drives between places usually just before or aft er I had been used at the White House or other places. It was con venient, as well as a security measure, because he could account for his time spent with me by saying, \"I was en rou te to NY or DC,\" or wherever he was going, and sinc e I was on the same time track as Henry it was all very time e fficient, and concealed his activity and connection to me. To Henry the efficient use of his time was everything . He told me, \" When people can master their use of time, they have the secret to success .\" He often talked on and on to me about his ideas, events and people, using me as a sounding board, completely assured that I couldn't ever break the security programming necessary to re member his conversations. Henry said I was much more than his efficient secre tary, I was a \"diplomat extraordinare.\" I wore a br ownish tan wool suit, tailor-made by my mother, to my first me eting in the Soviet Union. Henry taught me then tha t the Soviet Union, USSR and Russia basically all meant the same thing. He also told me that my mother was always w ith me giving me strength and maturity, and that I could f eel connected to her by wearing the suit she made f or me. I guess I was emotionally needing to be older than 10, my a ctual age at the time. So he bolstered me maturatio nally by mentally tying me to my mother. It was funny becaus e if I wore wool pants or a wool jacket, I would sc ratch myself and I couldn't stop it. And no matter how many time s Henry gave me the hypnotic suggestion, \"it's not scratching you, the material is soft and smooth on your skin,\" it still itched. So my mom had to line everything she made for me that was wool. JFK rode the L.M. sex tour regularly and while I was down on my knees he would pat me o n the back and say, \" You are really going to move up the ranks .\" Or, \" You're really going to amount to something when you grow up, kid .\" He loved lunch-time oral sex and the secret serv ice agents rode in the front with the limo driver a nd chewed him out royally for, as they said, \"... breaking stride that is nullifying National Securit y, Sir .\" To calm the disgruntled Secret Service agents, Jack would laughingly explai n, \" Relax, I deserve a relaxing lunch break, that's all .\" I can still remember his accent so clearly. JFK was really gutsy. He would even sneak me into the White House for \"nooners.\" Sometimes there was anot her sex slave with me and when we'd get up to the bedro om he would say , \" We're just furthering your training so you'll be top-notch when you grow up .\" He taught me, \"A man likes a woman who's aggress ive sexually. My wife doesn't satisfy me. She just lays back and waits. But a man likes a woman who takes charge.\" Then he would lay back and wait for the two of us to stimulate him, at which p oint he turned into an animal . Jack said he was training me for the future. I didn't know what that meant. He said I wa s serving my country by meeting the needs of their leader. He said, \"By easing my stresses you help me make bette r decisions.\" Touching the tip of my nose he contin ued, \"So young lady, you are very important to our nation.\" I was just out of braces. JFK had a lean muscular b ody and a hairy chest. He worked out on the rowing machine. O n one occasion as we were lying in bed together, he said to me, \"You know, we both have the same kind of teeth. \" I reached out and put my hand into his mouth to f eel his teeth and he was right, we both had big teeth--only his were more squared off. JFK also liked anal sex , like his brother Ted. After he found out I was with Ted he a sked me what his brother was really like. When I explained that he hurt me, he just shook his head and said, \"I never could understand what happened to my broth er. We both had the same parents, but we did go to different boarding schools and had different friend s.\" He further explained that they didn't see their par ents often and that their family had so much money that they chose the school that was the most fitting for their sons and sent them there. So as he explained, there wer en't many family interactions. He said he felt lonely a lot when he was growing up, that he was closer to the maids and nannies than to his parents. He said, \"The Kennedy Clan publicly appears to be a close kn it family , but I never saw my parents except on holidays when they would meet in Hyannisport and us kids wo uld be flown from our respective schools to meet them. It was more like getting reacquainted wi th strangers than meeting my family. Everyone was awkward and we really had nothing to talk about. I went out in a boat we had there and spent hours alo ne,"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"playing all by myself. I was estranged from my brot hers also because none of us lived together so when we came together we didn't know each other. Usually by the end of the holiday, we were friends again -- l ike real brothers -- but then it would be time to go ba ck to our respective schools and it would start all over.\" Then he added, \" I don't know why I'm telling you this, you're just a kid yourself and wouldn't really understand .\" He looked shy and vulnerable as he said, \"I'm so rry for telling you all this.\" I smiled and said, \"It's okay.\" It seemed to be the fact that I listened and couldn't think to talk, t hat made these men feel good. All they really wanted was someone to really listen . JFK never caused physical injury to me . He wasn't violent, just aggressive sexually but never brutal like his brother Ted . JFK liked all kinds of sex. He liked things varied, nothing routine. He got bored easily and as ked for new things all the time. We had sex in many places. He got high on taking risks ...the riskier the better. We even had sex in a public bathroom somewhere in DC. On those occasions, the Secret Service Agents were doubly ma d at him. They would totally freak out and say to h im, \"We could loose our jobs when you pull one of your litt le disappearing stunts.\" And they would be really u pset, sweating and nervous because as they explained, they'd been running all over the city looking for where he had ducked them. Jack just told them to relax, that he was fine and that they still had their jobs. I went on late night walks with JFK in DC. Sometime s the cherry blossoms would be in bloom and it smel led so sweet. The Secret Service agents followed close beh ind us. They seemed irritated to be on duty for JFK because he was so uncooperative and unpredictable. We walked b y a river or waterway. He really enjoyed seeing it at night and said the exercise did him good. The Secret Service agents complained of being tired and hated having t o get up at 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. to go outside with him. But when the President left, they had to go with him. I don't know where Jackie was, but she wasn't always at the White House the n ights I was brought in . Jack would sneak me to his room and supposedly no one knew I was there. Like I expl ained, he loved taking risks. Sometimes I had diffi culty understanding exactly what Jack was saying because of his accent and at other times, I wouldn't be abl e to hear for awhile from the noise of the helicopter or plane I had been flown in on. My hearing would feel muffled , like I had earmuffs on. I felt so much older than my young years, but then I was totally physically developed by the 5th grade (ten years of age). The personalities that were created to be wit h JFK were created to be older and more mature than my actual years. During my years at Hale Jr. High School ther e were times Henry Kissinger preprogrammed and sent me in with a message to deliver while I was prostituted t o JFK. I was a cheerleader and was prostituted to t he boy's coach along the way. I had a group of girl friends that w ere part of my Girl Scout Troop and one of my frien ds was named Beth. I wasn't ever allowed to go to boy-girl parti es, but I went to a lot of sleepovers. Many times I didn't end up staying overnight, but was instead shuffled off for a quick rendezvous to the White House or to Massac husetts or wherever the higher ups wanted me to go to be with JFK. I called him \" John-Feeee\" (pronounced \"John F.E.\") . Craig was \"president\" of the Student Body and it may have been a cover for my White House presidential use. B eth's mother was an attractive petite blonde woman and she was hardly ever home. I think Beth's father was a p ilot and maybe her mom was a stewardess, but she wa s gone most of the time. Beth had older sisters though and so they counted as adults in my protective mother' s eyes, so I was allowed to spend the night when Beth's mother w as not at home. One day I walked home from school w ith Beth, as she lived very close to Hale. We messed ar ound and listened to records, and then, suddenly, I became upset and told her I wanted to go home. She said her mom wasn't there to drive me and she didn't want me to go home, but I called a number from her kitchen phone and a yellow checkered taxi came to the house and picked me up. Beth followed me out the door crying and said, \"Do you want me to call your mom?\" \"No, I'll be home in a minute anyway.\" I handed the driver a note I had in my ove rnight bag and he took it from there. I was driven to LAX . The airport was much smaller in those days, but still b usy on Friday's and weekends with lots of traffic. The driver dropped me off in front of TWA and asked if I neede d any help. I said no, I was fine. I walked up to t he desk and told the woman my name, \" Sharon Weatherby ,\" and she had a ticket waiting for me . She asked if I knew where to go and pointed me in the direction of the gate. I usually flew TWA, United, or Continental on natio nal flights - not international - and I even had a little pin with wings, that a pilot who knew me gave me because he said I was an honorary stewardess. He had sex with me on the way back from assignments but no one had sex with m e before JFK. There were usually pilots on commercial airlines that were \"regulars, \" which meant they knew me and were instructed to kee p me under their wing . Sometimes I helped the pilot on flights, but usuall y I slept up in first class. I think one of these p ilots could have"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"even been my friend's father, and he was told to ke ep an eye on me. I usually curled up in first class and slept for the long flight. When I arrived at the airport in DC, I was met by different people. This time it was a blonde lady in a uniform and she walked me out to a waiting black li mo and opened the back door for me to get in . I did and she put my bag in next to me. This was before I met Craig s o I was eleven or twelve years old , going on twenty-five. I wasn't taken directly to JFK but was taken to the area where they operated the \" Lincoln Memorial Shuttle \" (oral sex ride) . A limo pulled up and I was whisked into the back of it. Once inside I saw that \"JohnFeee\" was there and he said hello and began tickling me. He played with me and teased me a lot. Then he pulled me over clo se to him and said, \"Now it's time to be more serious.\" And h e started kissing me and slipped his hand inside my shirt and felt my breasts. Then he unfastened my bra and pulled my shirt up and began sucking on my nipples. He said that really got him hard to see young, firm breasts and he circ led my nipples with his fingers. I didn't like it w hen I saw his wedding band on his hand while he was doing that to me because even under mind control, I knew who his wife was. Henry had told me to emulate her and so I felt bad... like here was this innocent, beautiful woma n and I was having sex with her husband and there was a feeling of guilt--even under mind contr ol . That day, JFK took sexual initiative and liked bein g in charge. Before he closed the window and left u s alone, the driver had said to him, \"Jack, don't you think we s hould connect back up to your security?\" meaning th e Secret Service. JFK said, \"No. Hell no. I deserve to have a life.\" And so we toured around the city while \"Jo hn-Feee\" got himself warmed up--sucking and licking me all over and I gave him a \"preview\" of the coming event by w ay of oral sex, backing off just before he orgasmed. He loved to run his tongue over my belly because he said, \"I love young, firm, tummies,\" and he loved mine especially becaus e he said it was so tan. He said I had a \"golden ta n.\" After awhile, JFK tapped on the inner window in the limo to get the driver's attention and said, \"Stop here. \" The driver said, \"Here, Sir?\" JFK commanded, \"Yes,\" and opened the door and grabbed my arm and took me into this small motel. He already had the key to a room and went right to it and opened the door. It wasn't a very nice place but he said we wouldn't be looked for there, that \" certainly no one would come looking for the Preside nt in a place like this ,\" and then he laughed, lit up a cigarette and sat down at the small table and chairs. Taking a puff o ff his cigarette he said he wanted to take a break to \"enjoy the view\" and indicated I was to take off my clothes in front of him. Slowly, I began removing my blouse and then my skir t, bra and then my nylons attached to my lacy garte r belt and then my panties. I had on those plain white ones an d for some reason he liked them, so Henry had me we ar them with him. Then I stuck my finger into my vagina whi le I had one leg propped up on the bed and the othe r holding me up. Then I put my fingers to my mouth and that's when he jumped up and came over to me and said, \"Y ou're a big tease.\" I smiled seductively and he put his arms around me and held me for a long moment and then when he move d back I began unbuttoning his shirt. It was a bit stiff lik e it was heavily starched and then I rubbed his che st and belly and talked to him about how his hairy chest and hard be lly turned me on. I put my fingers in my mouth agai n. He said, \"I'd like to be where those came from.\" I can remem ber his accent so well. He laid me back on the bed after he pulled the sheets back and he began oral sex. I tol d him how hot I was for him and began wiggling and moving all over, while I moaned. He said I was making him dizz y and he came up and began kissing me passionately, hard, almost roughly. Then he went inside me and satisfie d himself. After he came he pulled back and said, \" Sorry it couldn't have been longer, but I've got to get back .\" So he dressed and stepped outside the door and w histled. The driver came right up to the door. He went out and o pened the door for me, and we got into the limo and left. The driver dropped him off at another limo to a bunch o f Secret Service agents all in a tizzy over where h e had gone. He shut the door and walked into the center of them wi thout saying goodbye or acknowledging me. These agents were really angry with him. I could se e him using his hands and speaking to calm them dow n. JFK escaped from his Secret Service agents often. I hea rd one of them say one time, \" I don't know how he does it, one slip and he's gone .\" The driver put the window back up and drove me d irectly to the airport. I picked up my bag and he let me out and said, \"Will you be needin' anythi ng, ma'am?\" I smiled and said, \"No thanks, I have e verything I'll need.\" And I went to the ticket counter and said, \" You're holding a ticket for me? Sharon Weatherby?\" Handing me my ticket the man smiled and said, \"Your gate's in that direction.\" Henry had me think of the gate numbers as the numbe rs on billiard balls and all I had to do was follow the line of numbers until I got to the one that matched my tick et. Sometimes I got lost but someone always helped me, often"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"saying, \"Excuse me, miss, but are you lost?\" I'd sa y, \"I'm looking for gate eight,\" and they would poi nt me in that direction. Once I got onto the airplane it seemed like there w as always someone there to watch over me and I would go back to sleep. The return synchronization betwee n my mother and me had to be perfect and this time I was driven back to Beth's house to wait by the curb for my mother. The driver said, \" Just sit here and wait, your mother will be here any minute .\" He pulled away from the curb and went and parked nearby. I saw him watch until my mom picked me up. She, too, always waited for me to get picked up when she dropped me off at places. Everyone always waited to make sure the exchange had taken p lace and I was in the correct hands . JFK was my first presidential assignment. After hav ing sex with Bob Hope in his 50's, a younger Presid ent wasn't as bad. Sharon was the personality programmed to be wi th JFK and due to the reality that was created for her, she had a lot in common with him, like being Catholic and f rom an elite family. One time Bob arranged for him to have some time out with me in Key Biscayne. Bob flew me there to take care of him, keep him happy and enter tained. The Secret Service agents stood outside. JFK starte d by shaving and I sat on the counter and watched h im. I giggled and hugged him while he stood in front of the mirro r with a small white towel around his waist. I lick ed the shaving cream off his ear and then put my fingers into the remaining shave creme and licked it. Gently, he too k my hands away and laughed softly as he explained that you we ren't supposed to eat shaving cream. I thought it w as whipped cream, like I had tasted in the pornography I was f ilmed in, and mistakenly was triggered into recitin g my program, \"Lick it and suck it, 'til it's all gone, yum, yum don't miss a drop, or you will stop; your heart tha t is.\" This must have been a program glitch because I wasn't suppose to recite this program out loud; it was supposed t o just drive me from inside. Maybe JFK knew how to handle me nicely because of his sister who seemed like she was retarded . They didn't let her out much, and later I was glad when they didn't have her at their reunions, becaus e I didn't understand what was wrong with her. During this time, I wasn't allowed to eat as much s ugar as I had been previously used to. I was told t o be repelled by it and that, even as my hand reached for it, the su gar would move away and I couldn't ever get it so I should quit trying. Before this programming I was used to eatin g tons of sugar, so it was a major adjustment. Also , my mother used to get so angry with me for not eating enough at mealtimes, but I couldn't, as my programming dic tated. She said I didn't eat enough to keep a bird alive. But when I tried to eat I usually felt sick. Catholic g irls had to act proper and Jack never had any cause to be embarrass ed by my actions. He was spunky and aggressive and tickled me a lot, often until tears were falling down my ch eeks. Then he would lay me on the bed, kiss my tear s away and start having sex with me. He said he liked my short hair - that it was stylish - and he would play wit h my hair and mess it up. I'd just get it done again; in those da ys I didn't even know how to do my own hair. I neve r had to, my own personal hairdresser, a family friend, came to the house and washed it, cut it, curled and styled it. Afterwards, JFK and I ran around naked, playing like school kid s, and when it got dark we walked on the beach and the Secret Service agents always walked close behind. Boy did they get an eyeful. They would wink at me sometimes if I turned around to see if they were still there, when I was getting ready to make a move on John-Feee. O ne night, Henry let me off at the White House to target JFK. I didn't go up to his bedroom, we had sex in a room near the kitchen that had two beds in it. I had on a short w hite crop top and low hip hugger jeans. My belly bu tton showed and he said it turned him on. He would stoop down a nd lick my \"bare spot,\" he called it. His pronuncia tion sounded funny to the personality dedicated to him because o f his accent. I was tan and slim, and he said he li ked that my tummy was flat. He said he hadn't had such a flat o ne in awhile and it turned him on. After we had a q uick sexual encounter, I had to hurry to get my clothes on and exit real fast. He would open the door and look dow n the hall to see if the coast was clear. Then he would say, \"Oka y, now.\" And, I would run down the hall, out the do or and down the steps to Henry waiting for me in the limo smoking his cigar . He would usually say something derogatory about JFK and tell me to button my clothes correctly. My bel l bottoms had buttons on the front and if I was rus hed I had trouble getting them buttoned right. I was always s kipping a button. Henry would look down at my butto ns and tell me to straighten up. Then I would button them corre ctly. I couldn't help that JFK had rushed me - I th ink he enjoyed that part as much as the sex. He seemed to like the adrenaline rush. There was a very close call on another night. Jackie was down the hall calling out, \"Jack, Jack, Jack!\" Looking surprised, he grabbed me and put me in the closet, fixed the bed and answered her quickly before she o pened the door . You could hear the sound of her shoes when she ve ered off the hallway runner and onto the wood floor . I was in the closet when she came in the room and asked, \"Jack, what are you doing?' I heard him laugh and say he was looking for John-J ohn's shoe. He said one was missing. Jackie asked h im to come upstairs and he told her he would just look for a w hile longer and then he would be up. This guy actua lly let his wife"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"out of the room, pulled me out of the closet and st arted having sex with me again, this time with more passion than ever before. He seemed to thrive on the risk factor . When I left, the Secret Service agents usually wa lked me from the White House down the block to a waiting limo, u nless Henry was waiting for me outside. Henry was cultured . There were little blue vases with flowers in the back of his shiny black car. They had a little light next to them and you could see the flowers in the dark. If after one of these escapades I began talking silly and sexual, Henry would give me the sign to hush up by simply buttoning or zipping his lips and then I kne w to be silent and obedient. I could be turned off or on, volume up or down . I ran very mechanically like a Rolls Royce. Henry didn't like noise or children so he created me to b e quiet and dignified . As I grew older it wasn't as hard because I was more fully trained and didn't get my personalit y switching messed up. I got used to being silent w ith Henry. But it was a difficult transition after I was in the pr esence of JFK because he was wild and noisy, and hi s playfulness put me in the same frame of mind, until Henry toned me down. Why JFK and His Brother Really Got Shot JFK had ties to Frank Sinatra and his group . I was shared around all these type groups because of Bob's and Henry's influence. The Kennedy’s were highly mob connected, especially Bobby , as surprising as that might seem for the family man image he projected. JFK took a mob dispute with him clear to the White Hou se and attempted to use his political power as President to shut down h is enemies. He publicly appeared to go after the Mob , but he was interested in shutting down only one enemy faction . But he had to publicly say he was going after all underworld crime in order to be able to legally do what he tri ed to do: dismantle the Mob that opposed the Kennedy family clan . I overheard Joe Kennedy yelling at JFK at a family reunion when he was President . He told him to stop messing with the Mob , to leave it alone , that he didn't know what he was doing. It was sho rtly after that that Joe Kennedy had a stroke or brain seizure, and Rose blamed Jack for causing it . Joe Kennedy was very happy with the marriage of Jackie to Jack because Jackie brought with her a faction o f mob that would help build up Jack and the future Kenned y dynasty. At least that's what I heard him say. Joe Kennedy was big on mob connections, like his friend J.P. Morgan , who was an important mob buddy and supporter . They supported each other. As Joe Kennedy got weaker, th e tight rein of coexistence he held with the Mob be gan to loosen and his sons became sloppy and careless, and didn't take seriously the rules of the Mob. Like U ncle Frank (Sinatra) said, \" You don't ever try to go against the Mob or you'll wind up in the morgue or worse yet, sleeping with the fishes .\" I was born into Uncle Charlie's mob connection a nd he heavily influenced my life because of his arms, munitions and drug connections all over the g lobe. These were some serious connections that made him sought after by members of the Council. In those da ys, the Mob made the money and powerful connections . Different mobs supported each other like allies fro m foreign countries do. They were the power behind the Council, initially - the connections that allowed the Council to get such a toehold, as the mobs worked cliqueishly for or against one another. The Mob provided important funding in the early yea rs , but later the Council took away much of their power over monopolies when the Council outstripped them of their power through intelligen ce and outsmarting them with technology . The Mob couldn't begin to compete. In the beginni ng the Council knew how to work the different factions of the Mob for the Coun cil's benefit and gain. Once the Council a ttained the strength they needed to get over the hump and into the big m oney, they outsmarted the Mob with their mind contr ol technology and were then able to control the Mob . It was a game of intellect and the Council won-ch eckmate! Joe Kennedy, William Randolph Hearst, J.P. Morgan and others were part of a powerful underground grou p . They created their own revenue and their own justic e, and they knew how to play by the rules to stay a live and in the game, but the rules suddenly changed with the p ower created by the Council as they utilized the Mo b's success and made it their own . People like Jack (JFK) didn't play by the new rules so they got snuffed . Often when I was sent in to target JFK, I would be loaded with messa ges from the different mobsters like Uncle Frank (S inatra). I gave instructions for JFK to do some favor for the Mob or else, he was told, \"the small, sweet favors will dry up.\" JFK scared me because he always laughed and acted l ike he didn't take the messages with the seriousnes s I believed they carried. I had seen Uncle Frankie in operation and he had friends, lots of them, who killed people for nothing much at all , and I was afraid that if JFK didn't listen and do as they said that they would kill him, too. But he didn't seem the least bit concerned about them ...ever. I took them even more seriously after JFK was killed. Then I knew they weren't joking but were very serious and meant what they said about doing everything they said or be killed. "},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"I heard Uncle Frank talk often about people's posit ions in the Mob. He talked to lots of Mob buddies i n front of me. I was used for dangerous connections and, as far as Frank and Dean Martin were concerned, I knew far too much, so they wanted me to \"sleep with the fishes .\" But Henry wouldn't hear of losing his \"personal computer\" and threatened serious retaliation if they harmed me . Henry had a new kind of power that the Mob didn't unders tand at first, until they got burned a few times . Then they understood. But some serious action had to be taken to prove this power, like, as I overheard, \"the assassination of a President and his big mouth brother who just woul dn't listen ,\" in order for the Mob – a strong political faction of i t - to see where the new power lie, so they would k now to back off. By then the banks and newspapers were taken over an d reorganized by the Council and their constituents , and HIGH LEVEL TECHNOLOGY took over - something the Mob knew nothing about. It took the wind out of their sails. This was happening during the 60's and early 70's, when I was only a teenager approaching early adulthood, and listening and recording everything I heard per instructions from my boss, Henry Kissinger. One day in his office, Henry said, \"You won't be servicing him (JFK) much longer . The higher ups have some alternate plans for him .\" At the time I felt he meant death. Henry said, \" This will lock you in for life.\" Later, they used J FK's death on me heavily. When JFK was killed I was in junior hig h school and my controllers told me , \" If we can take out the President without anyone knowing, who would miss th e likes of you ?\" They told me I was dispensable, easily replaceable, and that no one would ever miss me if I were gone. To give me a clear example the suited man reminded me, \"Does your mother even have a clue whe re you are right now? NO. So who would miss you? No t even your own mother.\" In order to insure that I was under program and the ir total control they continued the ritual torture and trauma. Then they tied the ritual trauma that occurred at home o r at the church across the street from my junior hi gh school to songs or hypnotic commands, like \"If you try to beg in to recall this area of your mind, you will immed iately recall this horror scene,\" which they reminded me of in co mplete detail, in order to keep me terrified and pr ogrammed. Most people are now familiar with Marilyn Monroe's connection to the Kennedy family and her use with the President. It has been said by insiders that Marilyn was one of the first programmed Presidential models , created under mind control for sex with the President and u se in Hollywood connections. While I did not posses s the physical beauty that Marilyn Monroe did, I had the mind files and all the right connections to further my controller's interests. For my assignments, when I wasn't flown out of LAX, I left from Van Nuys Airport John Wayne Airport, or local helicopter pads that were atop buildings i n Los Angeles. My mother took me and picked me up a nd nursed me back to life if I was hurt or really messed up m entally or psychologically. She would try to make m e eat if I couldn't and she put me to bed. I was usually so ou t of it from the food and sleep deprivation and ele ctroshock done for \"National Security purposes\" to keep memory of the events safely away from my conscious awareness, that I often couldn't think to bathe, eat or get into bed to sleep. My mom would tell me what to do and the p arts of me that participated in these escapades always felt so reli eved to be back in my clean bed at home. In my atte mpt to create some semblance of safety and security I slept again st the wall to remind myself I was in my own bed an d safe. That was, until my father came into my room at night-the n the nightmare started all over again. More than a nything in the world I wanted my mother, or someone, to help m e--to protect me--to stop the nightmarish experienc es. But she never could. I will do everything in my power to st op these atrocities from happening, so that my daug hter, my sons, and any future children born into our family will not have to suffer any longer. I am sure the M ob with their huge capacity for family love and loyalty will unde rstand and pardon this need I have. And to Dr. Kiss inger, Bob Hope, UCLA, CIA, NASA, U.S. Department of Defense a nd all those who participated in my family's high-t ech programming, I ask that you honor this request for my family's freedom and safety. I will hold you in prayer, asking God to show you the ramifications of your actions. \"Be ye kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgivin g one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.\" -- Ephesians 4:3 p.132 Chapter Seven All the way with LBJ "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" Lyndon Johnson was a very tall and large man. He had a pocket wat ch on a chain that he wore in a high pocket in his vest or coat, not in his pants. He wore glasses to read. I remember him sitting at his desk readin g on into the night. The rest of the room was dark except for the light on the desk that he was reading by. He liked to wear his hat even when he was inside. He just loved his hat. He told me his hat was a Stetson and that back where h e came from it was the best... \"Like a Cadillac,\" he explained. His clothes smelled of cologne and his suits were often gray or brown and he often wore boots. He wore big white ba ggy boxer shorts and they didn't ever look new, as one would think a person in his position would wear. He had a bridge with a few false teeth on it, smoked a ciga r at times and other times he puffed on a pipe. On this occasion, he kept me in the bed in the dark ened hotel room while he sat at the desk to finish up reading his papers. Then he turned off the light and came over to the bed where I was tucked in, wearing a skimpy teddy. It was cold in the room. All Lyndon had on was his boxers and brown socks. He laid his clothes by the table a nd chairs, and when he walked to the bed he pulled his penis o ut of the hole in his boxers and pulled my head ove r to him. He commanded, \"Suck,\" while he pulled my hair to bring me closer to him. He stood, moaning with pleasure and then complained that he was needing to bend over too far so I got up on my knees and finished. He gratified himself in my mouth and liked to watch me swallow. Then LBJ cl imbed into bed and held me like I was a teddy bear and asked me to rub his back. One time he had me get out of bed to get him a ciga r. He wanted me to light it but I wasn't very good at it because I was just a kid. I coughed a lot and nearly choked t o death, but I got it to him in bed all lit. I hand ed him the cigar and he said, \"Thank you, little lady.\" He usually c alled me that. He didn't want to go to sleep right away and had me turn the TV on for him. He never took his socks off the whole time. One time when I was with LBJ he as ked me questions about school and seemed to like to hear m e talk about it. He also liked for me to wear my bl ack and white saddle shoes. I had very shiny patent leather ones. This was during the time I was still attending Hale Junior High School . Lyndon liked that I was very young. At this time I was around 12 or 13 years old . I was with him quite a few times. Another time my father took me to Texas on the flight back from Iowa. That's when LBJ showe d me his Cadillac convertible. He kept it parked in a separa te garage away from the ranch so it wouldn't get so dirty. \"Hell, everything gets coated with dirt on the Ranch,\" he said. He had on his dress-up cowboy clothes and sai d that \"Lady B\" was off at some china convention. He drank beer in the car when we went on a \"joy ride,\" he called it. I sat next to him and gave him a \"super-duper,\" which was comp lete oral sex gratification. He said, \"Be careful, I don't want to get any on the seat.\" I laughed and teasingly sa id to assure him, \"I know. I'm an expert in this ar ea. Remember?\" \"Well you sure do have spunk, I'll say that for you ,\" he replied. LBJ smelled but not like body odor; it was just a strong male smell. He had his arm up over the back of the seat and we only rode for as long as it took to satisfy his sexual urge. Then he took the car back and had me k eep my head down so no one could see me. I didn't g o inside the ranch and when we got back he said, \"This is as far as you go, little lady.\" I let myself out of t he car and slammed the door. \"You could have waited for my ass istance,\" he said. I laughed and said, \"I can do it myself.\" A suited man escorted me into the back of a black sed an that was waiting under a tree at the front of th e ranch and I was taken away. Another evening as I waited for Lyndon, dressed sca ntily in a black lacy bra, garter belt, black nylon s and red high heels, he declared I was making smoke come out of h is ears and that, \"it shore wasn't from his cigar.\" He wanted me to keep turning around and around and around while he looked at me. \"My, my...\" he said, licking his l ips and as he put his hand to his mouth he continued, \"My Lord, w hat do we have here?\" The heavy stench of his colog ne and smoke saturated clothes followed him over to me as he told me to bend over the bed with just those gar ter belts on and he stuck his penis in my bottom and then into m y vagina but I had to give him oral sex in between, \"to clean it off,\" he explained. It was disgusting and vile, even under mind control . Then we had intercourse and he liked it when I made noises. He had a cattle prod or some sort of electrical dev ice nearby but didn't use it much . When he pushed the lever it made a crackling sound and what emerged looked like a jolt of yellow fiery-type el ectricity. He said he didn't have to use it with me much because I was so good. He asked me if I liked what I did. I shrugged my shoulders and said, \"Yes,\" but due to the mind cont rol I was under I was unable to really think about his question. He told me he loved the young ones, \"...beautiful l ittle lady.\" He liked to kiss open mouth but he tas ted yucky like cigars. His private parts smelled, too. But then th ere was the cologne to cover up the smell. He was p retty fat from my perception, but big and tall. Lyndon had a mediu m to small penis for his big body, but he said he u sed it well. He wasn't really hairy and the hair on his head was thinning. He used something like Vitalis on what w as left of his"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"hair when he combed it. I think maybe that is why h e kept his cowboy hat on all the time, even in bed. I usually slept all night with him because he wanted me to. H e slept really close and held on to me. I spent the night and then in the morning I was taken home. When I was in the 10'\" grade, I spent the night with him more often - even sometimes on school nights. I didn't go to school u ntil 11:30 a.m. anyway and no one could ever seem t o tell I had been gone. Sometimes I missed a full day of school and no one at Hale or Taft High ever said anything to me . Another form of trauma was added when one day after school, I was forced to watch as the men in suits roughed u p my junior high school principa l . I was taken to the White House to be with Lyndon. One night he told me all about this lady named Agnes who he loved before Lady B. T hat's what he called his wife, \"Lady B,\" instead of Lady Bird. He said he never got over Agnes, just couldn't forg et her. He said Lady B fit into his future plans and worked out better but that he just really loved Agnes . When he talked about Agnes he had a goofy faraway look on his face. Lyndon told me his wife had grown to act old early on in their marriage when something of a maternal n ature happened to upset her. He said from then on she was n't much for sex, so he took care of his needs else where. He told me so much personal stuff that I think he must have forgotten how young I was. A lot of what he t old me I didn't really understand. But I listened, apparentl y to his satisfaction, because one day he complimen ted me by saying, \"You are a very good listener, young lady.\" Lyndon also liked for me to cuddle on his lap while he fondled me in an armchair as he watched TV. He usually covered me with a blanket. It made it more secretiv e and he pretended people were present in the room with us watching but they didn't know what we were doing. T hen he would ask me if I liked it. I would smile an d was programmed to say, \"of course,\" or, \"do more,\" or, \"you're so big.\" He loved it all. I wore Unforgetta ble perfume with him. It was pungent and strong but he liked it . He especially liked sex when I was menstruating - he said it turned him on. He liked to do all sorts of perverted things to me during that time , which I don't feel comfortable sharing here. He also suggested that I do whatever I usually did for the cameras and take charge of ou r sexual activity. \"You're in charge of the whoring, little lady,\" he would say as he smiled and tipped his hat . That hat was such an important thing to him. He talked to me a lot and told me all kinds of stor ies over the time he was President. He liked for me to call him \"Prez.\" He said when I called him Lyndon it made hi m feel guilty about Lady B so he said to call him P rez and I did as he commanded. Sometimes he wore those dumb elast ic things to hold his socks up like Bob (Hope) did. He looked so ridiculous wearing those dumb socks, his boxers and his hat, while he sat and smoked. He mus t not have cared what he looked like. The room was always kept pretty dark. He said he was most comfortable like that, but my eyes would adjust to the dark and I could still see how silly he looked. The teen personality progr ammed to be with him during those times was respectful and perf ormed as her programming dictated, but through her teenage eyes, felt he was just a dork. I did things that ma de him laugh. They were really dumb things but he s eemed to like them. Like once I pulled my hair over and around an d onto my upper lip and scrunched my lip up, pinchi ng the hair under my nose to make it look like a mustache. Sill y things made him laugh. He tested my programmed capabilities . He burned me with a cigar one time , because he said he was told to try it to see what happened . He looked pretty amazed when I took off my clothe s, sat down, got into position and told him to go ahead and stick it in, that it wouldn't burn me. So he pressed his cigar to my vagina and it didn't burn me. The pain didn't even register - \"it didn't even hurt,\" is what I told him. That made him turned on and he said, \"Little lady, you give me a big boner.\" He told me there was an e ndless stream of young ladies who liked his \"big bo ner.\" He liked the song that goes, \"I'm a long tall Texan , and wear a 10 gallon hat.\" He also liked Born Fre e and Burt Bacharach's Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head and B lue, Blue, My World is Blue. He also liked hot dogs and hamburgers, but hot dogs best. And he told me he li ked dachshunds, those little wiener dogs. I often f elt like a dog with him because he was always patting my head. I j oked with him about it and started barking when he patted me. I could really get off-the-wall with him and he see med to love it. He laughed and laughed like Nixon a nd Reagan did at the silly things I was programmed to say and do. I don't know if he was aware that I had been p rogrammed with most of the jokes. The men in suits usually to ok me to him at a hotel. They put me in the room to wait for him. I'd say the suits were the Mob, but Secret Service agents waited outside the door once the Prez got th ere. Once we were alone I was programmed to say, \"Hey Pr ez, got a big boner for my little pussy today?\" He would get all excited and start kissing and licking me. Yuck, it was gross. But it was the saddle shoes that rea lly got him every time. He liked me to wear my school-type clothes an d so I did. I was helicoptered from somewhere near Woodland"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Hills. Usually I was not flown in on a big commerci al airline to see Lyndon. I don't know why but it w as usually private planes. Then I would sleep with him all nig ht and be flown back to California. There were time s when, after I was used, the men in suits would let me out of th e car near school and I would have my school clothe s on from the day before, and I would just walk to school and go in like nothing had ever happened. One time when I was sent to Lyndon, somehow I ended up wearing the St. Christop her metal that my programmed boyfriend Craig had gi ven me for going steady. The men in suits would have norma lly taken away any personal item of this nature, bu t for some reason they missed my necklace this time. Johnson e xamined it and asked me what it was. Unable to thin k to lie, I told him it was a necklace my boyfriend gave me. Im mediately he looked depressed. So I climbed into hi s lap and told him not to worry that my boyfriend couldn't ho ld a candle to him and that I was forced to be with my boyfriend, but that I choose to be with him. He smiled, pulled his hat down over his face, and leaned back in his chair ordering, \"a blow job a-la-carte.\" So I performed as commande d. He said most women didn't love it the way I did. Lyndon thought Texans were the best and most powerf ul type of men. I was taken to Texas to be used sex ually by the Prez at a cabin or ranch out in the middle of n owhere. It had fences and horses and a woodcabin ty pe house, but there were hardly any trees or greenery, like in Ca lifornia. The cabin was wood inside and he had a la mp that was made out of a bootleg. He loved it and I teased him about it, \"Who's leg ya' got there holding up that light?\" On a table there was a picture of Lady B that had been t aken at the Ranch. We had sex there on occasion, be cause, as he explained, it was a place he could go and not be se en or bothered by anyone. The Secret Service could guard him well there since there was nothing else around and no one had any business going there unless they kne w LBJ and had been invited. Despite the security there, LBJ o ften wore a small gun strapped to his leg by his bo ot. He said he enjoyed carrying it. He waltzed me back to his room , to the bed he shared with his wife. He said, \"By sleeping here with you, when I'm f- -king the little lady, you ca n bet I'll be thinkin' of you.\" There were white limos with Johnson. He liked oral sex when we rode in the back. He made the Secret Se rvice agents ride up with the driver instead of in the ba ck with him and he would have them close the tinted window behind the driver. He told them he didn't want to b e disturbed because he and the \"pretty little lady were going to have a nice quiet chat,\" which in actuality was a s exual encounter. Usually he was being driven to som e location and upon reaching his final destination would debar k the limo, leaving me in the back, or I would be k ept waiting in the back for more when he returned. He could handle up to three oral sex encounters a day without any problem. He had his pocket watch on a chain in his vest pocket and would check the time to inform me if we were ru shed or not. Usually he would say we were rushed which meant I h ad to work quickly and get him aroused and satisfie d rapidly. Later, he wanted me to dance cowboy style with him and I tried but wasn't very good. He said, \"Don't w orry, you know how to do the most important things - you've g ot what counts.\" One day he gave me an iris from an arrangement on a hotel table. He bowed and did a li ttle dance as he held it out to me. It was really o ut of character for him. At the end of \"the Prez's\" administration, I was also filled with more mind file information. I was taken to different offices in DC to be imprinted with more t op secret, classified data by a female administrato r. LBJ also told me that the White House was a very lo nely place to live and that he really wasn't very h appy there. He said he was most at home in Texas at his ranch. Occ asionally he had meetings there and other men were present. I had to give oral sex to many of them. I was usually there for one overnight and then driven back to to wn by limo, then flown home. Before I was put on the plane to C alifornia, the men in suits always took me for a co ke and french fries at McDonald's. This was part of my programmin g to believe I was at McDonald's in California, so I wouldn't remember where I really was. The fries and coke wer e delicious since my programming required that I wa s food deprived before and during the time of my use. Then the men put me on the plane with the suggestion to sleep and forget. Because of our programming my mom never not iced I was gone and neither did I ... not until 199 1 ... over twenty-five years later. \"This, too, is apart of \"The Truth that will set yo u free. \" -- John 8:32 Chapter Eight Brain Surgery at UCLA took away my Father’s Free Wi ll"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" Bethesda, Maryland In my early teens, one of the places I was taken to was a hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. Two men in s uits met me at the airport, drove me there and waited while a n urse helped me out of the car and took me into the emergency room. I was doubled over in pain, having trouble wa lking because the men in suits had just slugged me in the stomach. They told the old grey haired nurse in the pink uniform with the little white apron, that I h ad appendicitis and to take me immediately into the emergency room. I don't know why but the men put a blond curly wig on me. I had on blue jeans, tennis shoes and a T-shirt. I was terrified and couldn't help myself. The nurse took me in and waved me through all the paper work . Two doctors, clad in full surgical garb met me at a doo r to emergency surgery. They told the nurse they'd take over from there and laid me directly on an operating table an d put a mask over my face and a needle in my arm. I had needles put in my arms all the time so that wasn't anything new, but it hurt. They told me they weren't who th ey appeared to be and then they put me to sleep with some sort of anesthetic, but parts of me from inside watched and knew exactly what was happening. There was great fear that they would really cut me open and take out my appendix w hen I didn't need it taken out. But instead, they put electrodes on my forehead, te mples and head, and headphones on my ears that delivered one sound to one ear and anothe r sound to the other . Then they varied the sound volume, quickly bringing the volume up so loud that it was excrucia tingly painful. I felt like I would go crazy. They kept delivering electroshock to my head. Then they inserted somethi ng into my vagina and shocked me vaginally, then sh ocked my head, and they kept that routine up for what seemed like eternity. I could smell the alcohol and could feel when they put a cold scissors-like thing up my nose. It tickl ed and itched. Then a doctor said, \"It's in place.\" Everything inside of me felt psychedelic from the d rugs they gave me. There were lots of colors and fl ashes of light that caused a very unreal feeling. I don't know how long I laid there. Eventually, they called for a n urse and told her to help me back out to the car. They said that I ch ecked out fine, that I must have just eaten somethi ng that made me sick. The nurse put my arm around her neck and help ed me outside. I had trouble walking but managed an d she delivered me back to the two men in suits. They, in turn, brought me to a darkened room all alone for awhile and then hooked me up to some of their own equipment. I sat in a chair while they put a band around my hea d and wrists, and shocked me while I listened to somethin g they played through headphones on my ears. I coul dn't understand the words I heard, as they were all mixe d up and it made me nuts to try to understand. Then they unhooked me and said it was time to go home. I was put onto a military helicopter with two rotors, one at the front and one at the back and transferred to another plan e that didn't have regular seats like a commercial airplane. There were just a few seats on either side and all sorts of straps and equipment on the floor. I laid on the floor during the whole flight. My mother picked me up at the airport and I slept in the back seat of our Cadillac all t he way home. She put me to bed and I could hardly move. I was in lots of pain and was nauseated, sick, and exhauste d for the next two days. I couldn't eat or get out of bed. I just slept it all off in a hazy, drugged sleep. Mom just thought I had the flu again. There were lots of times I was taken to places for programming. They had all sorts of schemes to get m e to the programming sites - even getting me to pull my car over to the side of the road, after I learned to dr ive. I remember how one man told me to get out of the car, while an other man pulled my hood up before taking me away i n an ambulance to Westlake Hospital. Then they flew me f rom there to wherever they wanted me to go. I remem bered an incident where I was on an operating table and I saw a whole roomful of women like me who were also laying on gurneys with white sheets over them, and we were all linked up together through a single wir e . There were mirrors all around and while I was deprogramming I realized that these other women were all parts of me ; they all looked like me but had different lives and different jobs. That's what my programmers told me in order to cre ate and enforce my multiple personalities. Sometimes there were groups of doctors or scientist s watching from chairs in a circular arena that ext ended upward. In this setting the doctors made presentations on t heir findings in order to display the research and show their progress so they could get additional funding or pe rmission to do more mind research into areas they w anted to explore. The stage where I was being tested and dis played to the doctors in long white lab coats was l ow and as I looked up there were rows of ascending circular cha irs in the arena from where they watched. Sometimes while I laid on the gurney, they would shine lights into my eyes and tape them open so I couldn't avoid the li ghts. They"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"blinded me with one color for a long time, like whi te, and then added in another color like red or gre en. It was painful, so I escaped like I had been trained from birth to do, into mental dissociation so I couldn't feel the pain. Often they paired electroshock with the bright ligh ts and music or word phrases. At appropriate times, they displayed a picture of Craig onto a holder in front of me while I sat in a chair that spun around and around. They played love songs while they spun me and when I cam e to a stop, I would see the picture of Craig and f eel relieved. They told me Craig was my lifeline and to sever a c onnection with him was equal to death. Later on in my life, they did that sort of programming with my children's pic tures. My Father Has Brain Surgery UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute 1967 The summer of my 16th year, our family physician, Dr. Stoddard referred my father for brain surgery to UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute. Dr. Robert Rand was the Neurosurgeon who performed the operation . My father never had a chance. Suited men came to visit and monitor us at crucial times. They were always watching and they gave him shots in his thighs and then asked him question s over and over, and told him what to do with me. Very scary and frightening events happened there to keep me fu rther under control . I can only imagine what they did to my father's brain. The day before his scheduled surger y, a nurse came into his room while the whole famil y was visiting before surgery. He held out a box and explained ver y matter-of-factly that the hair in the box was my father's, just shaved from his head, and in the event that he didn 't make it through the surgery they were keeping hi s hair to put back on his head in his casket. These insinuations, coupled with the ritual abuse I had previously end ured, were enough to further dissociate me. There were other h orrifying events performed to frighten me into furt her dissociation, creating even more control. My mother and I were told to wait in the hospital l obby until they came to tell us the surgery was ove r. They called a code name for me over the loudspeaker and respond ing to the call, I walked up to my father's hospita l room. A doctor in a white coat met me in the room and said he wanted me to enter the surgery room and watch. A s I entered, I saw my father with his head cut open, with tubes in him everywhere; in his head, in his nose, in his arm, and they told me that my father would no longer hold authori ty over me. Now he was totally under their control and, now they would be in total control of me. Then they str apped me into the bed next to him and gave me some sort of gas through a mask they put over my nose and mouth. They told me to turn my head so I could watch every thing they did to him that day - they took my real father away from me and the do ctor said that they would be in charge of everything that happened to me and all my progeny f rom then on. I didn't know what that meant, but I k new it was bad. They performed some sort of surgery on me, too . They inserted something under my nail bed and lat er they told me they moved it somewhere else and I would fi nd places on my body with skin flaps where I figure d they had put them in. They tested and experimented with implant after imp lant on me . With some implants they were trying to see if they could totally control me from a dist ance . Later when my mother came to look for me, she found me sitting in my father's room bent over with my h ead down to my knees, while a nurse standing by me explained , \"She fainted, that's all. She'll be all right.\" M y father made it through surgery and was placed in intensive care. S oon after, my controllers told me my father had die d in the surgery, that all I had to do was remember how he l ooked with his eyes closed to realize he was dead. They told me that my 'real' family would take over now and that I needed to understand that it was really best that way. And, although everything outwardly appeared to remain th e same, nothing ever was again . The life essence of my father was totally gone ; he was not in control of himself any longer . My brother Rick took over the family business and I began traveling more, internationally. Months after my father's release from the hospital, he came into my room and sat down on the floor nex t to my bed while I was studying. Upset and very emotional, whi ch was very unusual for my father, he said, \"Honey, big things are happening and I've lost control of you.\" Tears were streaming down my strong father's face. I didn 't know how to react. My macho father never cried. I couldn't t hink to question him or to wonder just what it was he was trying to tell me. So I let it go, along with hundreds of other questions and thoughts that any normal, unpro grammed daughter would have thought to ask. Institute Of Higher Learning "},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Sometime later, I was taken to a hospital in Montre al . My controllers called it an \" Institute of Higher Learning ,\" but instead of higher learning, I was put in a hosp ital gown and kept drugged and in restraints. A ver y important French personality inside of me was created and enh anced there. If I didn't cooperate they put me into a padded cubicle in the dark until I \"came to my senses\" and began behaving properly. I'd seen over the years j ust what they had done to my father and I couldn't take anymore. I had nothing to lose by not cooperating. From one of his personalities that was 'in the know' and before bra in surgery took his free will away, my father told me , \" You don't have to do anything they say honey, they want to ta ke your mind .\" Years later as I retrieved pieces of my memory that allowed me to see the bigger picture, I remembered numerous occasions when my father laid in programs to help me exit my abuse . He even gave me suggestions to heal and bring my pe rsonalities together . I've often wondered if this was a more significant contributio n to my successful healing than I could ever imagin e. \"All that is now hidden will someday come to light! \" -- The Living Bible Chapter Nine They didn’t see me as Human Sweet Sixteen Bob Hope was one of the first high-powered men Crai g 'delivered' me to. This, of course, was by no mea ns my first meeting with Bob, but it was a test for Craig and t he first time my young 'handler' would use the prog rammed skills he learned to take me to my assignment. For my 16t' birthday present in 1967, Craig surprised me with a trip, by train, to the San Diego Zoo for the day. Consciousl y we were programmed to be committed to a non-sexua l relationship, waiting for our projected wedding dat e to consummate our marriage. At least that is why we thought we were only spending the day, and not the night in San Diego. Due to our programming, neither of us h ad any conscious awareness that anything other than that w as occurring. We boarded the train, and after a whi le Craig delivered me to a private car where Bob Hope, Senator Alan Cranston , and a couple of other men were waiting. Craig left me with them and then robotically left t he room. I had sex with each of them as the others watched . They were all old men, even in those days. Later, Bob said he had a little job for me to do an d the next thing I knew I was in a big office with wooden floors and a desk with an American flag beside it. When Bo b introduced me, I shook hands with the man behind the desk. He impressed me then as an important man, like the President, but he wasn't. Bob left me alone with hi m. The man asked me all kinds of questions and I told him that I had been insurance company bonded as a requireme nt of my Christmas employment in a jewelry store. He seemed to like that. He also wanted to check out my body. Following his instructions, I removed my clothes and he 'chec ked' me all over by feeling. He put his hand behind my neck and pulled me over to him and began kissing me. This dark-haired executive was much younger than Bo b. He turned me around facing away from him and I c ould hear the noise of the zipper as he unzipped his pan ts. He pushed me over at the waist and began having sex with me from behind. He explained that he was checking the fit. I didn't know what that meant but was very emb arrassed, as evidenced by my red cheeks. He commented on how he liked it when I blushed. He said it meant that I wa s naive and innocent, and explained he liked them that way. When he was through 'questioning' me, he opened th e door and went and got Bob. He told Bob that I'd be fine, tha t he was very pleased, and went to his drawer, took out a folder, and wrote out a check. He carefully put the folder away, handed Bob the check and said, \" Here's a check for the cause .\" I didn't know what that meant either but they sh ook hands and both seemed pleased. When we left in the limo, I couldn't see where we w ere going, because Bob pushed my head down on a man 's lap for me to perform oral sex. The rest of the day was a blur. I didn't know where my boyfriend Craig wen t or if I would ever see him again. I was exhausted when we f inally got 'home' and that night I 'slept away' all memories of this experience just like I had been programmed to do.

At the time, that was all I consciously re membered. But, when I woke up to reality years late r and began recalling what fully happened, I remembered Craig h olding a small brown bottle with a dropper in it. H e put some of the clear liquid from the bottle onto a piece of celery and peanut butter and gave it to me to eat. After I did, everything kept moving, like a movie, except each f rame was moving in a fractured, uneven, hazed way. It was hard for me to even walk to the pool. I bent over, my st omach cramping and everything was spinning. I wasn' t suppose to notice that he had given it to me, but I did, and l ater I remembered other tunes. Happy Daze By the ti me I entered William Taft High School in Woodland Hills, my life began to change even more dramatically. Due to the mind control I was under, I constantly had a smile plast ered on my face whether I was happy or not. The rit ual abuse became minimal during this time, done only on occas ions that were required to maintain my mind control . Through a vast array of the latest in human programming tec hnologies, I was well on my way to becoming a total and completely compliant, efficient and multi-tasked ro bot. Looking back now, high school felt like one big blu r to me. I remember having only one close friend at a time, and knowing that I was \"popular\" but never feeling that way. Instead I felt ugly, stupid, awkward, shy and set apart from the other kids at school that were my age. I was ma de part of the Student Council so that I would have a public school image. Often my picture was posted on walls to announce upcoming events, or to announce contest s I was entered into. My presence leading and organizing ce rtain school functions served to allow many of the students to know who I was; yet very few students really knew m e or were close to me. A whole strategy was devised to keep me popular in the eyes of my schoolmates and most o f the faculty by making me a continual face or body by plastering pictures of me all over the school; yet, I was not in attendance on a very regular basis. Henry said it was for my protection, so others would feel below me an d many wouldn't even approach me as if I was a cele brity, and I was instructed to \"act\" that way also . I was known in school, without ever really \"knowi ng\" anybody because of the projected image that was publicly created for me. I felt isolated and alone, in a daze, like I really didn't exist. I was programmed to act snooty and too good for peo ple, to remain very aloof. Yet I was deeply locked into my own inner world, constantly mentally working to kee p all data filed correctly in all the areas Henry c reated. I was so inwardly focused that I had a very hard time in the physical world, hence the reason my mother did eve rything for me at home. Henry told me to spend all my time tend ing to the mental files. And while my mother did al l the domestic chores, I did as Henry commanded, often fl oating on a raft in our backyard swimming pool, sor ting mind files all the while in a trance state. I had many m ental exercises Henry assigned for me to perform at home. The system he created and used during my 16th to 22nd y ears was extensive and required mental work to keep organized, cleaned and neat. Henry said it took men tal muscle to keep the files in complete order. I w as elected Vice President and then President of the Girl's League A ssociation at school, and was part of the Student G overnment. I was voted 'Princess' at the prom, was paraded in a convertible at a football game and had my picture p asted all over the school for fashion shows and contests I was in. But, I never felt like I belonged; I just felt lik e a robot, living in a complete fog, and looking back that is exactly what I was. As Girl's League President, I was in charge of a fa shion show that was called \"Tivoli Gardens,\" a fore ign affair that was so named in order to scramble a lot of the inte rnational work I was doing with Henry abroad. They even used times I was supposedly buying flowers in downtown L os Angeles at the flower mart as a scramble. My mot her reluctantly accompanied me on the stage at the fash ion show to introduce the models. She was so shy an d embarrassed but she did it for me because I asked h er to. Henry had already taught me to see the audie nce in totality as one person I was comfortable speaking with and t o begin my speech as if the two of us were alone. A nd I was instructed to wear my speaking dress to give me con fidence and poise. Armored with these inner crutche s, I could speak with no hesitancy, no shyness, and no apparen t problem at all. I also spoke publicly for Henry at other occasions where he would load me up and book me a time slot o n stage. Sometimes it was a debate between fellow robots on political issues but I wasn't trained like they wer e - I was trained only to deliver. Many others were adroit at debating, but I wasn't. So I'd go up on stage, del iver my pre- programmed speech, everyone would clap and later He nry would say I did a great job. But I had to have on my speaking dress, and no matter what I was really wea ring, it became \"my speaking dress.\" If he was pres ent, Henry commented before I went on, \"My, you look lovely in your speaking dress,\" and then my speech would be internally engaged and I'd be ready to deliver. I p erformed in these ways for many \"show your latest t echnology in robots\" shows. After I passed those, I got to move on to more diplomatic matters. "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Henry used me to warm up groups that his constituen cy was going to speak to and I often wore several d ifferent disguises and always looked different. Henry was th e puppeteer and I was his puppet and at anytime he wished, he could pull my strings and make me change into a dif ferent puppet, with a different face with which to meet the public. And like Mr. Potatohead, he could order wha t kind of face he wanted me to put on. \"Squint your eyes a bit, curl up the ends of your mouth, flair your nostrils , pull your jaw forward\"...all sorts of different f acial mannerisms and contortions that I was programmed to perform, c ombined with wigs, glasses, body padding, hats, etc . It was all quite effective as I played my role creating differ ent faces to present to the public. Not many people know about this technology yet and Henry said we had a definite edg e on the others. He said that it was always importa nt for us to strive to reach greater and greater knowledge and a wareness, to stay ahead of the pack in being the fi rst, the best, and the brightest in our latest endeavors. He was c onstantly experimenting with me and adding things l ike archival information and classified documents, in order to h ave the latest information to draw from. Henry said, \"You're the leader of the pack in this diplomatic endeavor and as such we will continue to update your system in order to insure that you stay \"the leader of the pack.\" In a hypnotic session, he said to me , \"Each and every time you hear the song, \"Leader of the Pack,\" on the radio, you will think of the motorcycle bik ers only and will remain in the dark otherwise.\" The word \"dark\" was internally linked in my system to all sorts of ritual horrors and terrors, thereby plunging this information that was subliminally linked to it deeply into the rece sses of my subconscious mind. I could not consciously retrieve it; yet it ruled my actions. In this way the ritua l tortures that I had endured as a child and as a young adult at my c hurch were linked to these other memories. They tie d the ritual trauma to these memories by saying, \"If you begin t o recall such and such, you will immediately recall the ritual, and they would go into great detail to remind me of the tortures that happened at those rituals. They used the ritual tortures on and off at strategic, necessary times t o either bring to the forefront an old group of per sonalities, or to create a new group. A traumatic ritual could effect ively create a whole new group of alternate persona lities, since it was such an extensive trauma. Henry often spoke to his colleagues on this subject, advi sing them when and where to use trauma . Henry consulted with other men who needed guidanc e as to how to create and maintain a robot or group of them, as in Bob Hope's case. Bob had a whole group within me, eight personalitie s at one time, but Henry advised him to cut it down to four because he said he couldn't effectively maintain th at many until the level of technology rose, allowin g for more of the programming and maintenance to be performed by machine rather than by man. Henry said my prototype was not new but was highly expanded and more technical and he was building on an older model of a sex robo t and mind computer prototype, combining them within me i n hopes of expanding technologies and coming up wit h a more versatile workable model. He actually viewed m e as a machine. Dr. Olmstead , our principal, gave me orders in his office . When he did I would go into robotic receiving mode and record all the data he gave me. I transferred what was appropriate to my blue inne r calendar and filed the rest of the information into the suggested files for use at the correct time. My Student Government (Student Counc il) teacher, Saul Rowen , would drive me, to catch a plane or, more often, to a helicopter port where I was then transported to a government approved shuttle plane to Washington, DC or New York. Usually I was taken to Nixon for sex and to straighten out his often dour attitude and then to Henry and the research team for further instruction . Back home Dr. Stoddard prescribed a continuous supp ly of the antibiotic Tetracycline. He said I had to take the medication so I would not have pimples. I never was able to question this at the time, could not think to, but realized later on, as I healed and integrated, that I never suffered from any type of acne and must have been g iven this antibiotic to insure I did not infect the governmen t leaders with any \"social diseases.\" He also presc ribed mood elevators and mild tranquilizers for me during time s when I was extremely depressed as a teenager. The se helped to keep me \"happy.\" During the times I was being used by others, they utilized personalities that were ch eerful and energetic, so my moods were never a problem. Dr. Stoddard also gave my father shots of testosterone to boost his sexual desire. Looking back, my high school years had a very unrea l feeling to them. I didn't eat much in those days, in obeisance with programming, and was very thin like the popula r model of the time, Twiggy. I had programs in plac e that guaranteed that my physical body would maintain a p erfect size 6, or less, and usually in those days I wore a size 2 or 4. If I ate very much I became nauseated and cou ld eat no more. When I went for a few days without eating while I was on assignment, my stomach shrank and so it wa s difficult to eat much, plus I would often be very sick and shaking from the high voltage I was subjected to. M y mother often got into my twin bed next to me and held and"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"rubbed me to get my body to calm down. She also kep t saying, \"You're home honey, you're home.\" My body often convulsed and I had dry heaves but after I slept I was usually better. Rocketdyne/Rockwell International Ken Golliher was a nuclear physicist and a Mason who was respected as 'the brains' behind a lot of scientific plans or inventions while employed at Rocketdyne in the W oodland Hills area. He worked with Ellsworth Ford, Craig's father, who was plant engineer, and Mary, the women I've previously mentioned, our neighbor who for ma ny years was my 'second mother.' Ken's daughter Shelly was a member of the young women's Masonic organizat ion , Job's Daughters, and attended the same school as Craig. T hrough their friendship I came to know her. But it wasn't until some twenty-five years later that I began rememberi ng Ken Golliher, adorned with a white lab coat, whi te hard hat and goggles, waving me through the security guard a t the front guard gate at Rocketdyne . From his lab coat pocket hung a plastic badge with his picture and other inf ormation on it. I don't know what he told them to g ain entrance for me, maybe that I was his daughter or something. Anyway, they let me through the security gate driv ing my family's old '57 Chevy. I must have been around sixteen years old . Once inside the building, Ken showed me the monkeys in a cage and one monkey was sitting in a chair with its little head screwed into a metal framework that wra pped around his skull. Ken told me it didn't hurt t he monkey at all. Before I knew it, I was strapped into a chair , with electrodes positioned on my head . They told me that I was strapped in so I wouldn't move around. Ken was an e xcellent photographer and before me was a slide scr een. At first I was shown slides of nature scenes like flow ers with bees on them and then they began flashing technical slides with pictures of moon landings, instrumentat ion information, satellite diagrams, craft designs, mathematical equations and all sorts of technical information . There were slides of page after page of numbers, formulas and diagrams of assembly information for certain projec ts. One picture was of a mechanical chair that a ro bot--I mean astronaut--could maneuver around on the moon. It's possible that some of the astronauts are human robots, because I saw the formulas for programming them so they cou ld be controlled from earth and scientists would never have to rely on the astronauts human emotions' or human err ors in thinking. I saw a whole set of plans for tra ining and conditioning an astronaut. The United States actually sent many more people an d animals onto the moon and to other planets than t hey let be known to the American public. They were experimenting with all types of life forc es on the moon and didn't announce many of their experiments, or findings . The ones that were made public were strictly to c ontrol the feelings and beliefs of the American people. Unscrupulous scientists sent \"indigents\" as they called them, to the moon and other planets, and they usually didn't return ...or if they did they tested them to see what killed them . So great was the desire to explore other planets to be at the Russians, or to quench the curiosity of some totally left brain scientists, that they didn't care who they killed or hurt to get the desired results . They were doing initial research and used mind-controlled slaves to explore the possibility that humans could live in outer sp ace - on space stations and other planets. This was done in prepar ation for the elite families to have a place to go should the need arise. Even back in the late 60's they had tracking stations on the moon that were highly sophisticate d, and used to measure many things. Somehow they were even able to monitor the 'feeling s' of a population . They monitored the earth from the moon much more than they monitored t he other planets. This monitoring system was set in place to control a society--to control their feelings and th ought patterns. They rationalized these actions exp laining that in this way they would be able to create a society fre e of crime and violence, but that is because people won't be able to think for themselves. Their plans are for a society of mind controlled ro bots . I saw them perform studies on hamsters and rats whe re they totally controlled them by these means. Now they can do it with human beings and create any situation on the globe they want to peace, chaos, violence, wha tever they want and then they can go in with their invisible f requency warfare and publicly visible police force and take control. In this way people could lose all the free dom they once had. It is already happening. Without knowing it, people are loosing freedom over their own thoughts and emotions and will become controlled instead by technologies that they could never even have imagin ed, let alone thought possible. It is a sick, twist ed, and sinister scheme of global mind control. (See Nick Begich's book, Angels Don't Play This HAARP ) Back then, Rocketdyne had a test site in the Santa Suzanna Mountains, a missile range firing plant whe re the scientists had the privilege of quickly testing the ir inventions on the spot without having to wait fo r them to be sent"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"to other firing locations. The scientists liked tha t instant gratification. They could see how their b lueprints worked right away. So they had a total loop from blueprint s, to manufacturing and then to launch - and it was more than mere missiles they were firing off. Ken got me into the facility over and over in my teens, to hook me up to equipment that bypassed my conscious mind to record in my \"top secret mind files\" information about th eir ideas which needed to be passed on to alternate sites or the Department of Defense. They were all secretly i nter-connected with a huge web of criminals on the inside and at t he top who operated without the knowledge of the pu blic. 147 Army Base Programming More programming took place on an army base where I was escorted past some men in army uniform to an underground facility that we arrived at by walking down a steep flight of stairs to a large cement and grey metal- walled warehouse. I was taken past a room with desk s and computers to a room behind where the programm ing equipment was kept. They put me inside large cylind rical machines where I either laid or sat while the y did all sorts of things to me. One time they put me in a decompre ssion chamber where I felt like I was getting squee zed to death and then they put in some gas that made me laugh an d feel weightless. They hooked wires and electrodes to my head and limbs and they used loud sounds intermitte ntly with soft sounds, then blasted the loud sounds again during which time an army officer in a brown uniform deliv ered word phrases to me that were inaudible to my c onscious mind because of the other loud sounds I was being s ubjected to. They put me through a series of machin es ...ones that spun me, rolling me tumbling head over heals, for long periods of time. Then they laid me on a ta ble and shined bright lights in my eyes and loud sounds again in m y ears. At the same time, the officer yelled at me. I was so confused and out of it that another officer tried t o calm me down on the table so I could dress and le ave. I was escorted out into an awaiting limo. I did notice th at we were in an area that looked like the Californ ia desert. I watched and recorded in my mind files, much like a court reporter, while the American doctors in coa ts mapped my forehead and face and hooked me up to electrodes . There were other people in the room sitting like zombies all with their heads mapped out. We all have numbers th at follow us no matter what research projects we we re assigned to. They were studying our brains in a variety of diffe rent contexts , in all different environments , with different stimulation . They were also studying genetic effects, cultural e ffects, nutritional effects, every effect of enviro nment and genes on a person's brain function , their life function , their longevity, their functionality and productivi ty . They monitored (by the electrodes) and registered and ma pped lots of data that was imputed on brain functio n. This also furthered their understanding of how humans would d o on other planets and space stations. The movie Coma (1978 ) was later used as a screen memory (to scramble th is abuse), but the experiments were reality . Some data was taken much later on at Pepperdine University in Malibu, where I attended as a college student i n 1985-87, and some at international locations; one, a big huge ro om with dark marble floors in England. Back At Winnetka Tech Jokingly, people referred to my high school as \"Win netka Tech,\" and in essence that was an amazingly a ppropriate title for a high school that had an inner group of teachers and faculty whose agenda it was to create \"enhanced minds.\" The high school was a factory of \"young adu lts,\" as Henry Kissinger called us. In junior high Henry began creating my friend Candy's mind files, but said she was too robotic. Henry said I was a natural and ra n smoothly with no rough edges. Then there was Helen, the stud ent who was Girl's President before I was and there was also a male student, whose name I can't remember. Henry wo rked on them all but I was chosen above all of them because I appeared so natural and All-American, while the o thers he viewed as too ethnic or too robotical. Hen ry said he could still use them all at different tasks, but I was the most versatile and would fit into most situ ations. One of the women astronauts also graduated from Taft High School . At other times in high school I was driven on tho se small 'special' Los Angeles School District buses - the k ind they used for kids with special needs - to the Van Nuys Airport, or to LAX, or to different heliports on to p of buildings in Los Angeles. During the late 60's I was taken out of school ofte n and bused to different places for all sorts of di fferent things; sexually servicing important businessmen or politic ians, or meeting Nixon at some place on the beach i n California, or meeting Reagan at the Motion Picture Country Hos pital, or meeting Bob and his friends somewhere. Th ere were lots of important businessmen in Southern Californi a, Northern California, Sacramento, Santa Barbara, Ojai, San Francisco, San Luis Obispo, Santa Cruz, Carmel, etc ., that I was delivered to for sex and to deliver C ouncil messages. Suits, suits, and more suits! I never kne w where I was going and the driver of the bus was u sually a"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"different person each time. One time the driver was a lady who said she came all the way from the inne r city to drive me. She said, \"You don't look handicapped to me.\" I didn't respond, couldn't think to, instead I just walked off the bus and into the courthouse where I was to sexu ally service and pass a message to some circuit jud ge . Often I would get out of the special bus and later another special bus would pick me up and I would be taken b ack to Taft High School. I didn't spend a lot of time in class, but my teach ers didn't say anything when I didn't turn in my homework . I don't know why, but they didn't. There were tim es in high school that I was dismissed from classes for an entire week and spent the time traveling interna tionally with Nixon and Kissinger. While I traveled at times with Nixon, I was programmed to carry Henry's strategic plan for Nixon to tap into , whenever he needed to refresh himself with Henry's plan. I often stayed in hotel rooms, or waited in nearby rooms or the lobby, appe aring to be a regular person. Nixon would access me, before, duri ng, or after a meeting, always leaving the sex for much later on. But I was at Nixon's fingertips, armed and loaded w ith all the possible input and data any one man cou ld ever want. That's how Henry described this when I accompanied Nixon to China, USSR, the Far East, Vietnam talks, etc., always disguised as someone else in order to serve Henry's interests. So, in addition to my secret life during my so-call ed studies at Taft High School, I was flown all ove r the country and internationally, serving those individuals Kiss inger set me up with. I was having routine sex with the health and government teacher, Mr. Saul Rowen , who later became the owner of Cali Camp , an exclusive children's camp in Southern California . Some days when I was at school, during lunchtime, I was filmed pornographically by my brother and others in the photo lab at Taft. And I was having sex, all the while unknown to my conscio us personality, with members of the business community , and earned myself the D.A.R. award for service, f rom the Woodland Hills Rotary Club, upon graduation. Rockefeller and Kissinger Confer on My Future Uncle Rocky was my corporate sponsor and was in Henry's office one day when Henry turned to me and said, \" My dear, don't you have something to say to Mr. Rockefeller , here?\" \"Yes, Sir!\" I exclaimed all bubbly and excited. I took his hand and said exactly as Henry had preprog rammed me, \" Mr. Rockefeller , I would like to ask you if you would sponsor my further education ?\" \"Of course,\" he said, \"I would be most delighted to be a part of your future growth and contribution to mankind.\" Standing, he w ent on, \" For me to finance your education means that you are now part of my family and any young lady as bright as you are should call me Uncle Rocky ,\" and he shook my hand. Now I knew that he was part of my real family that Uncle Charlie (Charles Lilley Horn) had spoke n of. My reliability had been tested for several years an d I seemed to \"graduate\" to a higher level of use. What could be higher level than the President of the United State s? In my experience, the Council , and certain international individuals like the Rockefellers , was a higher level, standing head and shoulders a bove the government and United States politicians . With this 'honor' bestowed upon me, it took just three days for this highest level of programming to be accomplished. I'm not sure where I was taken but the walls in the room I was taken into were whi te like in a hospital. There was a flat silver metal band that w as fitted to the top of my head with adjoining circ ular outer bars that haloed around it. They coupled that with finge r connectors joined to wires that delivered electro shock to my fingers and toes. They sent electroshock first to b oth of my smallest appendages; my little fingers an d toes. Then they simultaneously sent electroshock to my next fi nger and toe, and continued in succession until all paired appendages had been included. At the same time they delivered the electroshock, they shined different colors of the red spectrum, which went through blue to purple, wh ile they were flashing the light. Next they did the yellow spectrum paired with a different set of fingers and toes. They completed the whole 'rainbow spectrum' using each finger/toe paired in sequence. I overheard them mention something about creating a perfect coordin ation between not only left and right brain motor symmetry but ac tual motor functioning, paired with brain wave patt erning so that, \" the android robot appears perfectly normal and huma n .\" I had to sit in this electric chair for what see med like hours while they did all this to me. It was also du ring this time period that I was introduced to Ronald Reagan . \"Faith comes from hearing the message, and the mess age is heard through the word of Christ.\" -- Romans 10: 17 "},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Chapter Ten Introduced to Governor Ronald Reagan I was slowly introduced to Ronald Reagan when I was a teenager. Private meetings were set u p by Bob Hope, for me to meet with Reagan at the small theater that is part of the Motion Picture Country Hospital (MPCH) located in Calabasas, California, just 10 minutes from my chil dhood home in Woodland Hills. The hospital is owned and operated by the Screen Actor's Guild (SAG). After m y father suffered a heart attack my mother took a j ob and worked there for 10 years, in the late 60's and ear ly 70's, as secretary/bookkeeper to the Assistant E xecutive Director. I was programmed to walk or ride my bike to the hospital to watch some of the movies that pl ayed in the small theater on the hospital grounds. I was instru cted to watch many movies that were used for 'progr amming purposes' to instill certain preferred attitudes or moods within me. Among them: My Fair Lady, Gone Wi th the Wind, The Unsinkable Molly Brown, Disney movies, an d the Wizard of Oz. Often during the showing, a man would come up behind me and zap me with an electron ic piece of equipment. At other times, seeing a movie was just a cover for privately meeting with Ronald Reagan . I was also instructed to read the book, Flowers f or Algernon, which was intended to scramble, cloud and cover the memory of experiences that happened at t he MPCH and elsewhere. It was there, in private, at the MPCH, that Ronald Reagan began to get acquainted with me, and with ma ny of my created personalities. I was instructed beforehand that I would have \"an important guest\" and that I w as to \"make a good impression on him, to give him the full treatm ent.\" The Council had big plans for Ronald Reagan and he fit the requirements for what they were looking for - s omeone who was pliable and could be directed. He pr oved that by following their directions from the beginning, e ven before he was elected Governor. He was a person who was patriotic, personable and was seen as wholesome, go od and genuine in the public eye . He was a \"good actor \" and was willing to jump through their hoops without que stion. They always told him he was working for the \"good of his country\" and he never seemed to question anythi ng. But I am getting ahead of myself. That first meeting, Reagan and I were alone in the small theater. When the lights were lowered in the audience section, that was my cue to begin my routine. The \" full treatment\" consisted of singing and dancing on the small stage for him, ending with a striptease dance. Afte r my seductive act, I walked out to where he was si tting all alone and climbed, naked, into his lap to recite my progr am. Following my programmed instructions, I told him that I could satisfy every desire or whim he could imagine , that I came complete with instructions and top se curity, and was referred by his friend Bob Hope . He seemed embarrassed, a reaction that would foll ow him over the years in relation to me, and a bit overwhelmed, but his response was , \" I'm sold ...tell Bob I'm sold !\" Having carefully recorded his exact response within my photographic memory as instructed, I clambered out of his lap, collected my clothes from the stage floor and got dressed. I had several personalities that were specially created to please Ronald Reagan sexually. One was created f or total devotion to him over the years. I was used extensively on and around 1968, at age 17, by then Governor Rea gan and soon after with United States President Ric hard Nixon. These top politicians were guaranteed that m y training insured the highest level of security. T he high level of mind control I possessed guaranteed that I could be used with these leaders who were involved in so me of the highest levels of national security, without my own awareness, therefore creating the most sophisticat ed level of security our nation had to offer. The spy doesn't even know she's spying ! Rendezvous with Reagan occurred often at the MPCH b ut the way it was set up was very secretive. On Sun day afternoons, or in the evenings, I accompanied my fa mily to the small movie theatre on the grounds. Whi le we were waiting outside in line I was instructed to say tha t I had to go to the bathroom and instead I would s lip into the backside entrance to the little theatre and wait fo r him to show up. Often he was waiting in the back of the theatre and I'd quickly deliver the message and return to m y family . Other times, I waited for him in the back of the darkened theatre. He would arrive looking secretive like he was trying to travel \"incognito.\" After we connected I would get up and go to the front of the theatre to join my family and he would sit down in my vacated seat. During the movie I would announce to my family that I was going to the restroom and I would slip into the row of seats in front of Reagan. As soon as I was in position in fr ont of him I rattled off a bunch of information mea nt to guide him. If he passed these tests by doing what he was told, then he could enter a higher level of the politica l arena . He was slowly informed that I was a robot who was merely r eporting to him from the higher ups . In the beginning they told him not to underestimate my abilities just because I was young, that I had years of powerful training to make me the"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"way I was and that he was to utilize me to the full est. Once he was elected Governor, they had me work ing between Nixon (as President) and Reagan (as Governor). They worked them together and were able to effect power ful change and legislation between the two. That was es calated when Reagan got into office as President an d later they utilized Pete Wilson in the same way. Lots of legislation was pushed through and by the t ime Wilson hit the office of Governor and Reagan hit President, they had the channels cleared to ge t through laws, bills and whatever else the Council needed for their own advancement . There was an older gray-haired, feeble looking ma n with a diamond pinky ring to whom I frequently reported at the MPC H. He often brought my mom a paper to sign. At time s he coordinated and delivered me to different rooms or cottages to meet with different people. He told me to go inside and wait. Often Reagan was the person I was to wait for. Other times he would say, \"Wait in here,\" and I sat in a lobby or room where a Secret Service agent came to deliver me to then-Governor Reagan. They took me of ten to a little housekeeping cottage to have sex and deliver messages to Reagan. Later the older man with the d iamond pinky ring would come and take me back to my mother's off ice. He didn't even see who I was delivered to meet . The Secret Service said they liked it better that way b ecause they said it was \"once removed,\" so it wasn' t as risky. There were instances where my mother would pull open a fi le drawer in her office, remove a file and lay it o n her desk for me to read and record. Displayed before me were log s of upcoming dates and times I was to meet Reagan or others at the MPCH. At other times I viewed papers full of instructions of things to say, including specific phrases, to certain people, or lists of columns of four figure numbers that I was instructed to encode and deciphe r. At some meetings Reagan would practice a speech in front of me in the thea tre. I'd take it all back to the Council and they would correct a line or two, give the exac t wording to be used, and I'd deliver the message t o Reagan again and he would modify his speech and deliver it as they dictated . Other times I was instructed to ride my bike to the MPCH or I accompanied my mom to work when she h ad extra work to do and I'd say I was going outside . She never questioned me. After I started driving at 16, I was instructed to report to my mom's office and ask for money or permission to do something, be ore I went to the theatre so she wouldn't suspect anything if later someone told her they saw me. The man in the theatre who let me in during off-hours 'appeared' to be a janitor, but I guess he was a part of it. Sometimes a group of men at a round t able met as I sat off to the side in \"park mode,\" w hile they discussed what needed to be done with me next or th ey'd argue about what I was being 'exposed' to. One man ended the argument explaining, \"that's what the boss orde red.\" The boss was Bob Hope. These men seemed to kn ow all about me. But Bob didn't like to meet or have sex w ith me at the MPCH because he said, \"Frankly, the p eople there are too old.\" It seemed to depress him to think abo ut old age. Million Dollar Babies I overheard conversations where the President of th e United States and other top politicians were offe red the services of \"escorts,\"--the CIA's latest human robo t technology--programmed sex and espionage slaves. They were encouraged to use these escorts to satisfy their se xual and emotional needs, instead of exposing thems elves to outside individuals, because these escorts were gua ranteed safe - had passed many tests to insure secu rity, were able to provide guaranteed secrecy and were safe from ve nereal disease. The presidents and others were high ly discouraged by the CIA from other avenues of sexual indiscretions for fear of public exposure. This fe ar of the consequences of seeking \"outside\" sexual gratificat ion, fear of adverse publicity or disease, and othe r security risks, created a heavy demand for the use of this latest h uman technology. As I later learned, Project Monarch beta trained sex slaves were called \" million dollar babies \" referring to the large amount of money each slave would bring in from a very early age . In the 60's the use of a Project Monarch presiden tial model sex slave cost around $1200 for an evening. Henry called me his \"million dollar machine .\" My father and his controllers had done their homewo rk, insuring I was Multiple Personality Disordered, certifiably under total and complete mind control and ready for use by certain individuals in top political and en tertainment positions, by the time I was a preteen. But what many of the CIA officials may or may not have been aware of was that a powerful group of men, whom I refer to as \" The Council,\" secretly ran the government . They were also able to access the \"mind controlled escorts\" and program them to subversively influence top government offi cials in ways that benefited the Council. The CIA's latest h uman technology was now being used against our own government. "},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"\"Each of us will one day be judged by our standard of life ... Not by our standard of living ; by our measure of giving ... Not by our measure of wealth; by our simple goodnes s ... Not by our seeming greatness . \" -- William Arthur Ward Chapter Eleven Mind Control in the Prisons Wearing white sandles, a red shirt and skirt, I was flown by helicopter up near Sacramento, California to the Vacaville Prison. It was another mind control exper iment only this time not on me. Mind control programs were tried out on the inmate s – programs they wanted to implement with criminal s, soldiers, etc., if they worked. Governor Reagan , who was busy touring the facility, wasn't around wh en they tortured and programmed the prisoners . He went off with a prison official while I was ta ken to deliver the verbal portion of the program to the men. On one side of the walkway the inmates were le ft alone and on the other side they were hooked up to electrodes, with a band around their head and wrist s, and were shocked . Then a guard took me to say programming phrases to them like, \"I will not commit a crime. I will behave in society like a good citizen. I will no longer offend. I will not rape. I will be calm. I will be peaceful . I will not fight. I will not swear. I will be an asset to society. I will follow orders. I will obey commands. I will serve m y country to the best of my ability.\" They even hoo ked up their penises to electroshock as a trauma-programming tac tic. When they were tortured, the men broke out in a sweat and some even cried, and after the trauma, they had me deliver the program phrases. Whenever I was alone with them, a renegade personality within me that could relate an d sympathize with their plight, slipped in the sugg estion , \" I will fight for my own freedom.\" One man was sitting holding his head in his hands a nd crying. His toe was being shocked through a cuff that went around his toe. These men were writhing in pain and were emotionally broken by the time they brought t hem to me to deliver the program suggestions. I was told to d eliver the messages slowly, distinctly and quietly so their subconscious mind would have to reach for it. Their conscious mind was way out of the way by then. Som e men urinated in their cots while they were being electr o-shocked. Their bodies jerked, they sweated profus ely and cried. A man who could still talk afterwards begged me , \" Why are they doing this to me? Help me. Please help me get out of here .\" It was awful. They helicoptered Reagan and I in and out. It was a top-secret project . By the time they finished with these poor men, they didn't even need to lock the jail cells. They looked and acted coma tose. At one time they said it was cheaper to keep criminals in prison than to sentence them to death. That was pro bably so they could further their experiments on the mind. Ottawa Prison System In the early 1970's there was a penal colony in Ott awa, Canada that Reagan corresponded and collaborat ed with to compare their rate of success with ours. I was flow n there with Reagan in order to completely and effi ciently retain all the statistical data on their inmate projects. In the early 70's the inmates were heavily targeted like the preschools were in the later 70's . Once we got to the prison location, he had to sho w a special clearance badge to the man at the door. It was a door inside, not the door anyone cou ld pass through upon arriving. The area we were escorted to was maximum security , which sounded like it was labeled that because of dangerous felons, but it actually held a top security status due to the sensitive nature of the experiments that were held there . Reagan said to the guards when we passed by, \"It's okay, she's with me.\" They usually just waved me th rough on his word alone. One time in one of the prisons we were in, a black guard said, \"What the hell...?\" when Re agan showed his badge and then tried to get me waved through. I t made Reagan so mad that he looked at the guy and said, \"Do you have a clearance?\" The guy said, \"No.\" \"Well th at's why you're behind that desk and I'm cleared to go through.\" Reagan responded angrily. The black guard just said , \"Suit yourself, Sir.\" And, we passed by. After th at they got a phony clearance for me so there wouldn't be any mor e problems or questions asked when we went through together. My job once we were in the secured area was to reco rd with my photographic memory all the \"stats\" on t he projects. Later in New York, I filled Henry in on the latest data. Henry took brief notes, maybe to follow up on certain statistical data, I don't know."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" Reagan and I went into secured NASA areas the same way. I was waved through in order to photographically record the data into my mind files in those areas, also. Sometimes we wore white hard hats and sometimes safety glasses or goggles were required in different areas . I liked when I had to wear them because then I di dn't stand out so much. It was generally not as acceptable or unde rstandable why I was there since I was a girl (late r a young woman) ...that's why they created my son Danny with the mind files. It was awkward to have so many que stions asked where, if I'd been a man, people would not ha ve wondered so much. The Canadian prison officials were very cooperative in the effort to share data o n mind control of criminals . They saw mind control as a means of benevolent restraint of a population that was destined to fail. They saw the experiments and research as helpful to these crimin als as it would eventually allow them the means to mov e more freely within society without endangering that soci ety. These statistics laid the groundwork for a muc h higher level of technology to proliferate than had been previous ly possible. They began working on pre-school children who would have the basic programming structure set in s o that in later years they would have the foundatio n already in place for future use, with a solid structure upon w hich anything could be built. Kissinger was totally in alliance with the pre-school targets because he was sure that the system was foolproof and self-contained, whereby he constantly saw the priso n system as an area of vulnerability since the subj ects were older and didn't have the basic programs locked in and at tached to much of anything except drug barriers and torture. Lots of these men were put into padded solitary cells an d were drugged, electro-shocked, and experimented o n. They experimented on the effect of drugs, music, implant s, and hypnotic suggestions in conjunction with the se other stimuli. Many countries were interested in the mind control technology . In some places it was traded for favors or different deals made with a country, but we kept th e leading edge technology. NASA In later years, Reagan brought some of the prisoners to a certain location to demo them to the officials at NASA . He showed them the progress he was having artificia lly \"lobotomizing\" these criminals (who Reagan ofte n referred to as \"indigents\"). It wasn't actual surgery, but i nstead, implants that were somehow controlling neuro-respon ses to the brain, making the prisoners incapable of doing anything they weren't told to do . He demonstrated how when angered they wouldn't respond violently. He even ha d other people throw things (like a bucket full of some liquid) at them - something that would have normally made a nyone angry. He described how he could justify layi ng off some of the prison staff, thus eliminating some of the costly prison system overhead in order to reduc e the state budget. I carried the state budget in my mind files that were used extensively during the time Reagan was Governor. Mind Control Demonstrations During one demonstration Reagan said, \"Strip for th e surprise effect, drive those scientists wild like you did me the first time.\" They were demoing all the uses for min d control application - like for behavior (violence ) control, or for intelligence operatives like me, a mind file or sex slave for the government, so the men in high offic es could have their needs met without security risk. These men fe lt they were that important. The elite, in fact. Reagan said, \"Our jobs are so vital to meeting the needs of the majority that having a little help like this reall y makes a difference in how we can perform in our chosen fiel d of employment. You will see that this is the technology of the future .\" At another of these demos, there was a military man in a green uniform with a bunch of those colored b ars on his pocket and an admiral in a white hat and uniform ad orned with all kinds of metals. They were there for the demonstration of mind control slaves and to see wha t could be done to help them get the most out of th eir \"boys.\" They carefully took notes while Governor Reagan spo ke and they watched as he demoed me. When demonstrating me after 1976, Reagan explained to the audience, \"Now this one has had a child and you might think t hat as a sex slave that puts her out of commission. Not true. What occurs is they become as maternal towards help ing the government grow as they do helping their"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"child grow and as I am sure you all well know, noth ing gets up a mother's dander more than having someone mess with their young. And that gentlemen i s precisely what we do. To the extent that this mother loves her child is the extent to which she will go to protect that child . All we have to do is alter her perception a bit in order to make her fear injury will come to her young and you've just tapped into the highest source of dedication and intense emotion th at can be regulated to fit the occasion.\" He went on with the following 'pep talk:' \" Many of the top minds in our nation are supporting this endeavor , both through scientific research all the way to financial banking and these men are among those who will insure that we in this country are not overrun by Communism. That will be our demise shoul d we fail to continue this valuable research, for t he Communists are already in the lead in the area of b ehavior control. They've already sent a monkey to t he moon and we understand that they are making major a dvances in the field of the control over the minds of their victims. So we should not fall prey to their evil intent - we strive to stay steps ahead of them . We owe it to the people of our country to have the best te chnology man has to offer. We cannot wait. We must do it now in order to preserve our freedom.\" [WHOSE FREEDOM RONY? – MC] Somehow, Reagan actually believed he was championin g prisoners' rights and furthering the safety of th e public. He talked about finally putting to ease the trouble d minds that these criminals were born with - by al tering their brain function. \"Lobotomies without a lobotomy,\" th ose who spoke of this technology all said. Kissinger thought the prisoner stuff was \"a waste of precious time wh en more productive technologies could be applied to 'brighter subjects ,' instead of wasting the technology on the prison population.\" Henry said he thought Reagan was an absolute imbecile, who didn't have license to opera te . I didn't know exactly what he meant by that. Reagan did horrific things to demonstrate his progress wit h the prison population , even to the extent of sticking one of the prisoners with a long needle to show he coul dn't any longer feel pain, inside or out, and would no longer be a problem to himself or to society. Reagan talked abo ut how they were able to lay in a new framework for life for these people. He was talking about the mind control projects done to \"normalize\" prisoners that were t o be put back on the streets. That way they felt they would be ab le to empty the prisons and reduce a large percenta ge of the state budget, and it would help with federal funding as w ell. His vision was that one day all criminals could be \"cured\" in this way and go on to live a life free from crime w ithin society, not locked behind bars . There were actual programs instilled into the minds of the prisoners with the use of audio and other equipment, located in variou s areas around the country. Some of it looked like electric chairs but they were modified to deliver regulated doses of electricity to simply slow or alter the mind in certain areas. He said these men were simply \"routinized,\" which meant the y awoke the same time each morning, ate breakfast, went to work, came home, watched television, ate dinner, we nt to bed. Reagan laughed when he said, \"We even go so far as to suggest they keep their lawns and yards well man icured in order to keep the neighborhoods up.\" He said, \"This spills over into all areas of society. These peopl e will become productive and the cost to all of us taxpayers will be greatly reduced and, eventually, as we become b etter at this, we may not even have further need for our prison sy stem. We will have a crime-free society--just imagi ne that!!\" Henry cringed when he heard Reagan's ideas and ofte n berated him in front of me for acting irresponsib ly by putting out a product that was not time-tested. Henry said an experiment on the public (although criminal ) sector was risky , as there were no controls in place to insure the person's memory would remain locked up. Nor, Henry reasoned, \"do we have the test of time to know how the experi ments work. You're sending these people back into society without any exterior controls and no means of monitoring them. It spells disaster, Ron.\" Of course I never mimicked Henry's accent when deli vering messages, but this is how I heard them. But Reagan had the power to do what he wanted and so he did, a nd Henry just constantly shook his head and said, \"It's people like him who will ruin this whole area for the rest of us.\" "},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Henry worked behind the scenes trying to align othe r powerful California politicians, like Alan Cranston , against Reagan in areas that wouldn't be detected but would be felt by Reagan. He wanted to get him out of the way before he, \"ruined the prospects of the future.\" Perhaps R onald Reagan's recent demise is more than Alzheimer 's disease. Kissinger and Reagan often had heated arguments where Henry gave him a piece of his mind, but Reag an just rationalized it all away by saying Henry was \" an unbalanced egghead ,\" or an \" unbalanced intellectual ,\" depending on who he was talking to. But publicly he acted like he got along well with Kissinger . He never did, although Henry prepared me for a lot of seeming \"favors\" wit h Reagan, like using special mind files and sexual pleasures. He didn't let his disdain for Reagan get in the way of using him for his own benefit. While Reagan was ca rrying on and on about his great contribution to society, Kissinger was slipping in all sorts of information for me to drop on Reagan . I was meant to get him to change certain laws or to veto certain bills or to get friendly with some po litician or foreign leader - the list was endless and Henry Kissinger \"worked \" Reagan for years. Since I was so intimately linked with Reagan over the years, Henry \"seized th e golden opportunity\" to influence Reagan in the Wh ite House. Henry felt it was important to see beyond Reagan's apparent weakness and capitalize on it for his own benefit. Henry Kissinger and the New Age Craze Henry Kissinger also manipulated the New Age craze . Henry said people who would believe that guides and masters were leading them should be guided by maste rs, and he considered himself one . Henry said I could trust anyone who wore a crystal as part of my 'family of man'...that's what he called our mind controlled gr oup because it was a family experiment in dynamics, breeding, rear ing, etc. These experiments encompassed how everyth ing effected a person, and they felt they might as well learn on the slaves what would be the best for the ir future progeny. A whole business was made of the New Age t o the slave community. As books and items were created for those searching for truth , the self-appointed 'enlightened ones' who were 'in the know' manipulated the spiritual ideologies in order to hide many of their mind cont rol realities . What was behind much of it was really a group of men, controlling mind-controlled robots and herding them in the direction they wanted them . I was programmed to deliver to a famous Los Angeles channeler , the words to say just before a Whole Life Expo event where he channeled the message to a very larg e group of people in an auditorium who were in an a ltered meditative state. Henry gave me the exact words to say . They were targeting high-level slaves and it encomp assed those programmed with whales and dolphins, angels, ascended masters, east ern religions, energy, quantum physics, UFO's, aliens, channeling , and listening to your guides and angels . They felt if Los Angeles failed then the rest would because most were patterned after Lo s Angeles. I have met persons suffering from Multiple Personal ity Disorder that felt they were channeling entities, when in fact they were channeling parts of their own personality structure . One day a woman 'channeler' named Shirley graciously offered to channel privately for me . Earlier, other people had paid her $50 to channel for them, but I was not among them. I told her I would be glad to ask a ny questions she had of herself while she was in a channeling state of mind. She agreed. The answer to the questi on when posed about \"if Shirley had been involved i n any of this ritual abuse stuff,\" was, \"Shirley is not ready to face that reality yet.\" Channeling can be a very cl ever way to cover the reality of Multiple Personality Disorder and of fers a way of covering up when personality systems break into conscious awareness, explaining it away as 'an enti ty.' When a slave is told \"it is destiny that your guide s and masters brought you here ,\" or \"feeling drawn to a place\" or being told, \"Yo u know it's no accident that you are here,\" it can really flip them out because unconsci ously they know it's not an accident that they are there, and they know they are not supposed to tell and so it does a double whammy on their mind-controlled system. When I arrived on Kauai, people I had never met bef ore warmly and lovingly came up to me, hugged me an d dropped the message, \"Welcome Home.\" I was consciou s and recovered enough to know that they were unawa re that they had just delivered a very powerful Oz pro gramming word phrase intended to lock down my progr amming, insuring I couldn't access the deeper levels of my mind that were being used for \"national security\" a nd were not supposed to be my own. The New Age was used to help usher in the New World Order . It was part of a mini-experiment on total and complete mind control . Henry created lots of concepts to use. It was imp lemented in Los Angeles as the pilot experiment using a new form of philosophy to direct the people into mindlessness until the higher tech nologies"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"could take over creating by the year 2000 'the perf ect utopia.' The New Age was the formula for comple te takeover - a way to lead many in the ways they needed in order to be in total control of Los Angeles by the year 2000. While I still lived in California, I was given instructions for New Age things to read, watch, and places to g o, etc. They were beginning to get people to identify with 'globalism ' as associated with love, peace, and good feelings . Many songs also readied people for this one-world, global real ity with powerful love harmonics . I, too, believe that the earth and the people living on it in harmony is a beautiful i dea, but we need to insure that we don't loose the freedoms that we all hold so near and dear to our hearts, especially the freedom of our own minds and to know where our thoughts come from. Many slaves were also being used in projects for re mote viewing , one of the CIA's secret weaponry, and in experiments in regard to parapsychology. Many of us were taught to telepathically communicate, as a means of reading the enemies' minds. While the media cast a negative image on psychic ab ility, our own government was dabbling heavily in it, using mind control operativ es to participate in their projects . NASA Future Technology as Seen from the Past Lyle Curran , a NASA employee and Craig's uncle, often tapped i nto my NASA mind files when we went to their home in Los Alimitos or when we met up with them on our numerous trips to Mexico, mostly Mazatlan. Fro m the information Uncle Lyle accessed from my mind files way back in the 60's, 70's, 80's, rockets and missiles were a thing of the past , and directed energy in the form of weaponry systems was what they were planning on using as the new weapons of the future . No one can see it coming, nor defend against it . They could take out the lights in entire cities and blame it on UFO's . The Department of Defense experimented for a long time, until they mastered this technology. It puts nuclear weapons right out of business . I am not saying that I don't believe extraterrest rials exist, because I think that would be extremely igno rant. All I am saying is that there are real live h uman beings that need to be taken into account for the evil deeds th at were done. They can do surgery with energy, making no incisions . They can insure a body doesn't disease by monitor ing the electromagnetic field variations. I witness ed awesome medical feats, but even as they are funding these projects, the public is still not benefiting from the use of this technology. This information is held in top secret clearances . \"But I will restore health to you and heal your wou nds,\" declares the Lord. -- Jer. 30:17 Chapter Twelve Nixon, Kissinger, and International Business All roads lead to Hope ...Bob Hope that is. Preside nt Richard Nixon was connected to Bob Hope also - i t seemed like everyone was. President Nixon used me sexually from approximately 1969 until he resigned in 1974. I was with him in many different places and sometimes Hen ry Kissinger was with us also. Henry Kissinger never used me for sex; it was always strictly mind file use . At times, Nixon participated with Henry in utiliz ing and accessing my computerized \"government mind files,\" but both f unctions (sex and mind files) could not be used at the exact same time, there had to be time in between uses. The Council The Council accessed me many times without the knowledge of the politicians who were enjoying my services . In this way, the Council was having direct access to i nformation channels with and about influential peop le, like presidents, governors, senators, foreign leaders, a nd celebrities. Looking back, I was likened to a sa tellite orbiting around the globe, used by then Governor Reagan (for sex and messages), President Nixon (for sex and me ssages) and Henry Kissinger (for mind files). Later, the Co uncil would access me and send me back to the polit icians with different messages and motives than the ones origin ally intended by the Government. The Council had me delivering messages between President Nixon and Gov ernor Reagan. The Council worked them together and was able to effect powerful change and legislation to s uit their own needs, by manipulating the two of the m . Sometimes"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"there was a problem if I was programmed by two diff erent factions for the same event and was instructe d to target two different people--or worse yet, the same person . In this situation, I would carry programmed messa ges from two different groups, with one group's message contradi cting the other group's message. This type of situa tion created terror and confusion in my inner system of personal ities, and I was usually punished by one or the oth er faction for not delivering the information correctly. This happ ened at a Gubernatorial Ball during this same time frame. The Mob/CIA had one set of instructions I was to delive r to President Nixon, and the Council had a whole d ifferent set of messages for Nixon. The Council programmed me wa y in advance for this Gubernatorial Ball, but the Mob's/CIA's programmed instructions came to me last and closest to the event. Like a jammed computer, I sat in a chair in the corner, afraid to move, until a Secret Service agent came over and hand signaled me as he rubbed his finger under his nose a few times, cleared his thro at and said, \"Are you lost, little lady?\" The Secret Service agent's prompting got me \"back o n track\" and I was triggered into action. I deliver ed the message from the Mob/CIA instead of the Council's m essage. This particular occasion was around a time when the Mob/CIA wanted to control a drug line going through Nicaragua and Paraguay to the United States (Chica go). They were trying to ignite terror in that area , via civil unrest , in order to create a situation where the United Sta tes would be persuaded to go into the foreign country to supp osedly \"protect them .\" [SOUNDS FAMILIAR? – Iraqi Freedom Mantra? –MC] What would really be happening is they would just be opening up a \"legal\" but hidden drug pathway into the country so they could have free access to their drug sourc es. In light of this set of covert 'goals,' the Mob /CIA programmed me to approach President Nixon after thi s gala event and after sex, report how admirable I would find him and our government if he would authorize our tr oops to go in and help the Nicaraguans-- to give th em the aid that they so desperately needed. Per program, I rel ayed innocently and sincerely that I felt it was ou r duty as a free nation, concerned with maintaining freedom for all people, to aid those less fortunate, since we held so much power. I continued persuading Nixon that all Americans would be proud to have a preside nt who was so conscientious, reminding him that other presidents before him had gone down in history as heroic defenders of democra cy and freedom. It was a very \"patriotic speech,\" a slick story, in tended to appeal to his well-known sentiments. He s eemed to fall for it; at least he seemed inflated and inspired by it. Although I did not have the ability to comprehend or make decisions on my own behalf due to the mind control I was under, the delivery of the Mob/CIA message wa s a fortunate choice for my personal safety. The Council was more forgiving but to get caught not delivering a message from the Mob/CIA was like stealing the drugs or mon ey at a drug deal . There were severe consequences, and often I was violently punished . When they debriefed me in order to get the inform ation about what I had or had not delivered, and what the reaction was of the person receiving the message, I operated like a machine, w ith no defenses of self-preservation and no ability to lie . So I reported exactly what happened and ended up getting beaten up or tortured in some way if I made a mistake. They were very brutal. I was in yearly attendance at the Celebration or Bi rthday Party of the Elephant, the Republican Party - the GOP. The large room was decorated with red, white, and blue banners; the decorated tables set for dinner and ce lebration. There was also a large stage, decorated for the pol itical speakers. It was crowded, noisy, and people were taking pictures with camera flashes going off all over the place. I was sent in to be a sex/espionage agent. It was strange to see people there I knew like Governor, and then lat er, President Ronald Reagan or Senator Pete Wilson, only I was programmed to not consciously recognize them. In fa ct, I was programmed not to be able to even see the m at all. \"Just ignore them,\" were the rules ...unless they a pproached me. Although I obeyed my orders at the ti me, the fact that I was Multiple Personality Disordered allowed other parts of me to not only \"see\" them but regist er these occasions into photographic memory as I had been tr ained. Sometimes at these conventions, I never made it out of the back of a limousine or was restricted to a separate room away from everyone. Men, usually politicians, were brought to me for qu ick sex . They called this activity by names that are not appropriate to print here. This partic ular evening, I was programmed to target President Nixon. I wore a blue, off-the-shoulder dress with a diamond necklac e. I probably looked like just some other young gir l, partying at the convention. There were other slaves there also, to perform quick sex for other politicians. I don' t know if the Council was also accessing them. "},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Pat Nixon accompanied President Nixon, so he had to break away from her to have a \"quickie\" with me in a back room. Nixon did things like that before he got depr essed with the Watergate scandal . After that he started acting old and beaten down. It was like the life just went out of him . President Nixon accepted me with smiles because he was grateful for the times I had been able to help him quickly recover from depression or negative emo tional states. I could perk him up so he felt better and could mor e efficiently function in his important job. At lea st that is what they always told me. The Council made sure I had th e road paved to President Nixon, free and clear, an d over time he listened to me despite the fact that I was only 18, 19, 20, 21, or 22 years old. I helped him with what they called \"his difficult times,\" until the end when he had to resign the Presidency. Henry Kissinger Took Up Residence in My Brain ...and Never Paid Re nt In the late 60's and early 70's the mind control programming technology was advanced, but ce rtainly not as advanced as it was in later years. I nstead of being hooked up electronically to a machine that co uld automatically program information into my mind files, like is available today, my programmers used the less ef ficient, but only tried and true method available a t the time. They used my programmed ability to have personaliti es who were equipped with photographic memory, read or scan documents to memorize them . To accomplish this a personality was put into a r eceptive mode and told to look at a document as a whole, like I was taking a pictu re of it in its entirety. That way, later on, I cou ld look inside my mind files, see in my mind's eye the picture of the document and read it to Henry or report whatever i nformation he requested. For Henry, it was like having his own in visible laptop computer (within my mind files) avai lable whenever he needed information. In the beginning when I was first being programmed with mind files, Henry took me to different places with filing cabinets, and instructed me to go through certain f ile drawers to digest information. He put me in the mode to store data in coded mind files and then left me to absorb information. The \"government mind files\" that I po ssessed were created from being put into rooms in Washington, DC at the National Archives, Pentagon, State Departme nt, the Federal Reserve building, Rocketdyne/Rockwell in Ca lifornia and other places. I was also instilled wit h information at military bases around the United States regardin g top secret project's. So, I had the latest inform ation regarding top secret experiments and defense and space inform ation if Henry needed it for reporting to others at meetings. Kissinger arranged a special clearance to get me in to these top security places. He also took me into some private offices at night in the dark. We had to be very qui et while I digested huge amounts of private party i nformation. Some of the files I have been able to identify are information regarding: history; foreign countries; travel information; federal and state documents; visual or ientations to certain locations; maps of foreign co untries, including information on climate, terrain, ocean ac cess, mountain access, etc.; individual person's pr ofiles listing preferences, perversions, place of residence, frien ds and connections; a postal file where those invol ved all over the globe could log on to send or receive messages from each other; peace talks files; foreign leader file s; research findings and experimentation files; strategic logis tics files; banking systems files; etc. It was a wi de and vast assortment of information to be accessed easily by Henry. There were hundreds of files and many new files wer e added over the years from different agendas between the Council and Henry . Kissinger was more familiar with how to access the information than anyone else because he created my internal system. He knew how to access me for different func tions, in addition to keeping the plan of the globa l elitists organized. This form of communication allowed them to secretly communicate around the globe at times w hen they didn't want anyone to be able to publicly associate their connections. I not only kept rooms full of i nformation, neatly tucked away in my brain for easy access, but it gave Kissinger and others an advantage as it ap peared they were less prepared and had less data at their finge rtips than they actually did. No need to carry armf uls of books and brochures. He just brought me along and utilized me when it was time to recite information he wanted o n any subject he had programmed into me. Plus, he and oth ers who knew my programming could instill and retri eve arcane 'e-mail messages' from around the globe, oft en with the latest top secret knowledge gleaned fro m classified experiments and projects or messages in regard to t he New World Order agenda. I was a REAL robot. At one time, Henry had a dark wooden desk with a gl ass piece covering the top of it and his big chair squeaked when he sat down. There were lots of wooden floors where Henry took me initially - \"old culture\" place s. Nothing was ever really new looking in those days but that changed over the years. Henry brought me into his o ffice, sat me down at a chair across from his desk while he pulle d file after file out of his filing cabinets, and l aid them open on the desk in front of me. Then he said, \"Quickly mem orize this data, we're going to a meeting.\" He woul d also categorize the data by saying, \"File this under A-3 ,\" or whatever name or code number he labeled it. H e"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"meticulously named each file and when he would loan me out to people he would tell them the file ident ifier so they could access the information they needed. He usuall y would leave me alone with the files to memorize. When he returned, we went to the meeting.. Henry rationaliz ed this, saying this way he didn't have to hold tri vial details in his mind but could save it for more important matters, such as strategizing. That's how I heard him explai n it to others who knew about the mind control technology. At times he would hand me top-secret documents and say, \"Record document #1-12,\" and then he would lea ve me alone to photograph them in my memory. Later when h e needed specific wording from one of them he would call me over and, if he wasn't talking to someone or in the middle of something, he would have me read the information from my mind aloud to him. If he was in a meeting o r was busy he instructed me to write the informatio n on a note pad and then later when he needed it he would pick up the pad and read the information from it or refe r to it and people present would just think I was his secretary or aide . This happened for years. At night, Henry snuck me into lots of top secret pl aces where documents were stored and gave me a flas hlight and instructions to go through and memorize documents. He let me into these places and then would leave me alone, recording documents into mind files, often for hour s at a time. Later he came back to get me. There were times he was sweating when he returned and was in a real hur ry to leave, even if I was right in the middle of a document. Then, when we got into the car he would sigh like h e was relieved. He would become very nervous, thoug h. Henry always readied me for the Rockefeller Christmas parties , but so would a group of other men who were sometime s with him and knew how I worked . It depended on who was to attend the party. When they obtained that information, they went about strategizing and deciding what I sh ould say to whom . The Rockefellers have been in a position of power for a long time. Kissinger seemed to work hand-in-hand with them often, in or der to \"satisfy their goals in the most efficient manner .\" There were times Henry loaded me up with informatio n specifically for someone and then I would be the secret liaison between the two. This occurred between Henr y and Pete Wilson . Pete was often Henry's California arm. This way Pete could carry out his wishes without it being known where the instructions were coming fro m. The White House When important meetings were held at the White Hous e, sometimes Henry took me along if he felt there m ight be information that was \"crucial\" to have at the \"ripe \" time. He told people I was in training or some ot her excuse. One time he even had me write information on a napkin u nder the table so as not to be noticed. This specif ic napkin event occurred around 1971, because I remember that I had my hair done up with a hairpiece full of cur ls on top. I was 20. Henry had my clothes ready for me; usually very tailored, conservative, dark clothes, most oft en a navy blue jacket, skirt and low navy heels, or a disguis e. He laid my clothes on the bed in a room with two twin beds with white bedspreads - the bumpy kind. He told me to ge t dressed and left the room, closing the door behin d him. Later he returned to get me. At other White House dinners, I wasn't present at t he table with the other guests, but Henry was. When I didn't fit into the plan of the evening in order to sit at the table, Henry still \"prepped\" me and kept me in the kitchen or another room in the White House, close to the dinin g room so he could come and access me if necessary, without anyone knowing. So I sat there in 'park mode' and w atched the White House kitchen staff cook and serve . At those times I was dressed like a kitchen staff member wit h a black skirt and white blouse, so I didn't look out of place. Henry explained that if I didn't stand out no one w ould notice or pay attention. My \"attire,\" as he ca lled it, was never meant to call attention to my presence but instead was to make me fit in and look like I belonged. Ove r the years Henry parked me in some pretty strange places. When he would arrive to access information, I would scr ibble it on a piece of paper he would take with him, or if it w as brief he would access me verbally and would simp ly remember what information he extracted. Henry often said, I was his \"left brain,\" so he could use his mind for more important matters. At times while I was sitting with he and others in the dining room, Henry would often leave the table to go make important phone calls. He would either leave me at the table to smile and be pleasant, but instructed me to avoid conversation, or he would take me with him to obtai n further input via the telephone. Sometimes he wou ld carry his linen napkin from the dining table and looked prett y dumb but no one seemed to notice."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" The White House was a place I was taken to in order to \"do a job\" on certain leaders - some foreign, s ome domestic. I was given very clear suggestions and instructions on who to target and how to go about it. I was briefed on their likes, dislikes and preferences and was told certai n phrases or key words to use throughout the conver sations I was programmed to have with them. Henry was often invit ed to the White House when the President was entert aining foreign guests, even after Nixon wasn't President a ny longer. They felt, and rightly so, that Kissinge r was well versed and knew many of the cultural customs of for eign dignitaries so the risk of making a faux pas c ould be avoided. Henry was confident and seemed to know eve rything about foreign policy. When he was invited t o a dinner with a foreign dignitary that the Council wa nted to have me privately entertain later on in the evening, he wouldn't use my mind files at the end of the evenin g so I could be used for sex. Henry secretly knew that messages conveyed to targe ted individuals during the 'behind-the-scenes' sex stuff meant more to people because then they psychologically in terpreted and categorized personal experiences such as sex in with their memories of personal or family experienc es. Thus the message became stored as more valuable since it wasn't strictly business. Henry said combining his messages with sex would store it in a different part of the brain , with the personal experiences being filed with more importance emotionally and so it would carry more weight or influence. Usually arrangements for a sexual encoun ter with me were made secretly between Henry and th e foreign guest. Then the guest and I would be limoed away so mewhere to a hotel or taken to another place. But m ost of the people at the White House gathering were unaware th is took place as we would all leave separately, and rendezvous at another location later on. Or, Henry would have a limo waiting and I would enter and wait. Usually I was put in the limo first and waited for the dignitary. Then w e would spend a few hours or the whole night togeth er, while I dropped a preprogrammed message at the perfect time to the leader. Then I was flown home. One day I was in the White House delivering a messa ge to Nixon from Kissinger. Nixon and I were standi ng in a large room where there were some tables lining the walls and couches and large rugs covered the wooden floor. Old pictures dotted the walls, fresh flowers were in be autiful vases and heavy drapes covered the windows. I guess Nixon thought we were alone as we stood facing an o il painting on the wall by a long table. Dick had h is arm around me as he was inputting a reply back to Henry through me. A hand on my right shoulder was standa rd procedure to encode incoming messages and Nixon was doing it all properly, however, halfway though the message, his daughter Trisha came into the room . She looked very pretty in her nice dress, but she didn't know I was there and when she called out, \"Dad,\" it startl ed her father and I, and, in turn, she was surprised and shocked . It was one of those very awkward situations where it a ppeared she instantly summed up the whole situation and thought her father was being romantic with me. Nixo n acted extremely guilty and stammered uncomfortabl y until he finally introduced me as someone from the State Department. She didn't seem to buy his explanation and left the room annoyed and upset. Nixon said to me, \"Don't worry about her, I'll take care of this.\" But he said it with his hand still on my right shoulder, so instead of it just being a casual stat ement meant for me, it actually became part of the his message to Henry. After that Henry began to devise a way for m essages to be encoded without having to touch my sh oulder in order to avoid these types of situations. International Assignments There were times I was flown to foreign countries s o Henry Kissinger or President Nixon could utilize my computerized \"mind files\" at meetings they were att ending publicly or later privately. On the flight t o these countries, it was my job to make the President comf ortable. I took off his shoes, rubbed his feet, pam pered him and brought him anything he wanted. Secret Service agen ts surrounded him. When I flew with Kissinger and Nixon was not there, I was told to sit or sleep quietly next to him. He nry often slept on the airplane. Nixon did not. I believe that the Secret Service agents at times knew what I was real ly doing sexually with Nixon because occasionally they witne ssed when I came on to him. Like one time when I le aned over and put my head on his shoulder and reached down to unzip his pants, a Secret Service agent who was ju st walking up from behind, laughed and said, \"Excuse me, Sir.\" At this point Nixon took my hand away and quietly said to me, \"Later, dear.\" "},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Beijing China There were dirty waterways in some parts of China a nd the streets in some areas where I was taken were dirty. One square was full of flags in the courtyard. I was th ere on foreign assignment with Henry Kissinger. I f lew independently and was taken to a hotel by a Secret Service agent. The Secret Service registered me in the hotel under a phony name with a phony passport. Henry met me there. Usually I flew privately on a chartered jet with Henry, but this time it was last minute notice so w e flew commercially but separately. We were there t o swing a deal with the leader of China. Henry told them I wa s a foreign correspondent and we sat at a long tabl e with lots of Chinese men and I sat next to Henry. I always sat t o Henry's left for his convenience in tapping me wi th this left hand leaving his right hand free to write or smoke his cigar. He told me to smile, look pretty and \"ta ke it all in,\" which meant record data into my mind files. He noti fied me who to zero in on and \"listen intently\" to. He also used access codes to refer to my mind files. No one knew that I was a high tech programmed computer that wa s carefully and precisely recording details and spewing informa tion when my mind files were accessed and called up on. President Nixon's Loyal Friend Bebe Rebozo BeBe Rebozo was President Nixon's good friend. He was present on many occasions when Nixon used me for sex. One such time was in Miami, Florida. I was flown in to Miami and taken by limo to the beach where I was to meet Nixon. As usual, I was put into isolation before my use with VIP's and this time was no different. BeB e Rebozo and his men took an active role in my \"preparation\" for Nixon. Rebozo was violent and cruel to me, slapping and hurting me . He took me to a totally dark, windowless, cement room and left me there, naked and alone in the dark . Before he left, men injected drugs into my lower ar m and left me for hours without food, water, or clo thes. This was before I had children, so they could not yet use th at powerful maternal bond to keep these programmed secret events amnesiac, like they did later on. Because of this, the physical torture to me during this time was acc elerated, but was never as painful as the things they later did to my children in order to \"keep me in line.\" Rebozo dre ssed in fancy expensive suits and wore gold jewelry. Subconscious ly I hated him. On this occasion, Rebozo came and released me from isolation and took me to a restroom to clean up. I showered and put on the bikini they left for me and soon was readied for action with Nixon. I don't know exactl y where we were because I was programmed never to look or noti ce our location, but I was taken to President Nixon at a private beach house. My instructions were to \"tease him, pl ease him, ease him and help him relax in the sun.\" It was on this private beach, watched from every angle by the Secr et Service, that I seduced Nixon. I was laughing an d joking with him as I undressed him from his suit, tie, and dress shoes. Then we slipped into the water while I further seduced him. After he was satisfied, I was removed and taken somewhere to get \"prepared\" for an evenin g event with the President. Nixon had dinner in his room an d I accompanied him while he ate, then satisfied hi m sexually and was taken away. Nixon was not as passive sexual ly as Reagan was. He made an effort and took initia tive. He preferred the missionary position. I suggested we k eep the light on, but he always wanted to turn the lights out, so he did. I never slept in the bed with Nixon after s ex - it was his rule. I never did spend the whole n ight with him, like I did with some of the others. I was instructe d to wait until he was asleep and then to very quie tly notify the Secret Service agent at the door to the suite. The agent took me out of the room and I was flown direc tly back to California with all details of the event carefully tucked and hidden away within the personalities pro grammed for Nixon. Per program, I slept the whole flight home. In the beginning years with Nixon, I was programmed to make him happy and to satisfy him in the ways I had been trained and programmed to. Just as the Council anti cipated, over time, Nixon's trust built in relation to me, paving a way for me to be used in ever more influential circ umstances with him. There were times I was taken to Key Biscayne, Florida, to service Nixon. He was with Be Be Rebozo there and it seemed that BeBe was in char ge of the events that occurred while we were on his turf. Eac h time, Rebozo put me into isolation in a small cem ent room and slapped me around before he left me alone in the ro om naked, cold, and hungry, in his words, \"to get r eady for 'the boss,\"' as he called Nixon. Rebozo would tell me ho w \"the boss\" deserved respect and whatever it took to make him comfortable. He spoke in broken Mob language. He ac ted like a really tough guy and was very loyal to h is friend Nixon. When he came to release me from isolation, B eBe instructed me, \"make yourself presentable,\" and I was cleaned up and dressed. Then, I was taken by limo t o a beach that had palm trees on it. We arrived at sunset. Since I was programmed not to notice where I was geographic ally, I had no way of knowing where I was, but at t imes I overheard others speak of our location and that inf ormation was stored along with memory of the event. We pulled"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"up to a very secluded house where there weren't a l ot of other people around. The house was on the bea ch and a lawn surrounded by a short fence led out to the oce an. Miami meant more serious business, but Key Bisc ayne laced pleasure with business. Deals between the Mob, Council, Rebozo and government officials or other interconnected mob factions took place in Miami or Key Biscayne . At times, the \"big guys,\" very important or influen tial people, would join in the business and pleasur e at Key Biscayne. Connections were big business with the Mo b. I was instructed to sit with the guys and make t hem happy by giving them whatever they wanted. Men with guns stood in windows in the back of the house to guard Nixon. The Secret Service let the Mob protect Nixon up clo se and they kept guard further away. I think Rebozo arranged this protective situation but I do not know why it was set up like that. Rebozo was very protective of Nixon ; he even rode in the back of the limo with Nixon while I was with him. BeBe was only nice to me when Nixon was around and he made it very clear that he didn't tru st \"dames\" and that I was only there because Nixon wanted me to be. BeBe watched protectively when Dick and I went for a swim together. Rebozo did not go in the wate r. I guess he didn't want to get his guns wet! He never was wi thout them. During these times, I was instructed to come on to Nixon, and thoroughly and enthusiastically excite h im. He liked it and said I was \"good for him,\" and that I helped him a lot when he was upset. Nixon said I could pic k him up when he was down and refresh him. I was programmed to be funny and silly, without a care in the world. Nixon said I made him laugh. Rebozo was most often present when I downloaded Council messages to Nixon . BeBe seemed to understand \"the language\" and so Nixon wanted him to be present when I relayed memos beca use he always had to make the decision and give me an answer before I could go ba ck . That was the rule. I gave the message to Dick and BeBe; then the three of us stayed together until they wer e able to come to an agreement. Usually it was a yes or no question. But no one could leave until I was upload ed with the return message . When it was time for me to leave Key Biscayne, an agent whose job it was to prepare me to go home, took me out for a walk on the beach. He bent down and holding up a shell he picked up in the san d, 're-minded' me that all events that happened the re were now out of my head and forever locked in the shell. To finalize this compartmentalization of my experience , he threw the shell out into the surf, in an effort to keep the m emories hidden from my conscious mind. From there, I was helicoptered to an airport and flown home. This all happened before I was married at age 20 . Watergate Created a Depressed President During Watergate, Nixon had a very hard time . He looked gray and dismal, and it was very diffic ult to cheer him up. But after a drink I could lighten him up a litt le. I teased President Nixon in his down months, te lling him how cute I thought he was when I saw him on television, even when he was in deep trouble and was being pub licly challenged over the scandal. Due to my programming, I was not really able to ever \"see\" him when I wat ched television, but was programmed to say that. The thi ngs I would say to him were so opposite the truth t hat, as he said, he found my statements \"refreshing and funny. \" These statements seemed to be just an added bit o f entertainment to cheer up old Tricky Dick. In those days, it wasn't much else with Nixon; just deliver ing sex and messages. BeBe Rebozo loved Nixon dearly. He was ve ry protective of him and had tender, emotional mome nts with Nixon that I was present to witness. BeBe cried when Nixon told him he had to step down from the Presidency . I can still hear BeBe now as he said, \"Oh no, Boss, not after everything you've worked so hard for.\" He touched Nixon on the shoulder and wa s genuinely concerned as if it was happening to him. That always confused me about Mafia guys - they wou ld torture or kill someone one moment and then turn around and show deep, caring concern for one of their own the next. To them loyalty was everything. Henry Kissinger was not involved with BeBe Rebozo . Henry was \"too intellectual\" for BeBe. Kissinger said he did not like to mingle with the Mob . When Kissinger was present it was strictly business, concentration, work and strategizing. Pat Nixon was never around at these times either. Richard Nixon was manipulated by the Mob and by the Council . He was part of their intricate network and when Watergate came down, he was the most dispensable. T hey viewed Kissinger as more important, someone the y vitally needed to protect and so their strategy dic tated that Nixon would take the public fall. I was not sent to sexually service Nixon after he resigned the Presid ency. International Mind File Postal System Henry c reated a mental postal exchange system inside my head. He cr eated it first visually by telling me that there wa s a large box in my head with separate boxes inside of it and the y each had a different key. He explained that there were rows of"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"numbered boxes positioned layer upon layer. Program s were attached to numbers or people, places, or do cuments, etc., which were attached to numbered boxes. George Bush wanted always to be #1 in everything so Henry had to change someone else's number to give George the #1 box . This system worked like a post office so that peo ple had a box and they could receive or send information at their box. This system was the way the higher ups kept their communication clear and anonymous when access was n ecessary. It kept the Council's messages clear for me to deliver accurately or to receive a message to take back to them. It kept messages clear and straight t o be delivered between people who were involved and who didn't wan t to be identified as knowing, or communicating wit h, each other. I met with and delivered messages to the Cou ncil, at times, on huge ships out in the middle of the ocean. I was most often helicoptered to ships, hotels, isl ands, or wherever I was to deliver this anonymous i nformation. Once the information had been exchanged, I was heli coptered back. Henry created the programmed system for these communications. He was the mastermind of lots of th eir plan, and used me to further it. Kissinger, Bush, Reagan, Carter, Thatcher, Mitterrand, Trudeau, Gorbachev, S alinger, Ford, Nixon , etc. all participated . Sex Paves the Way for Diplomatic Relations I was briefed, in adva nce, about the customs of the countries we visited, in an effort to further diplomatic relations. At many foreign me etings I was told, \"be invisible, and smile when sm iled at.\" I was also instructed to hang back, be quiet and just lis ten, unless I was cued to report information. I was further briefed in detail if I was to be sent in on a foreign leader o r diplomat. In addition to all the sex training I h ad acquired over the years, Henry added his 'two cents.' He said in many foreign countries lovemaking is an art form . Henry expounded, \"To the degree you can match that slow deliberatene ss, is the degree that you can sexually gratify you r partner.\" Henry spoke of sex like the art of eating . He didn't show any emotion, or embarrassment; it was something he instructed me about very openly and plainly. He explained that the slower and more deliberately a person performed sex, demonstrated their level of self-esteem, self assuredness and that, as a woman, I had to balance that with a fair amount of shyness, in order not to appear bold. Shy ness was what Henry said would soften what otherwis e would appear as being too forward. With one leader (a kin g) I was sent to, Henry had me say, \"May I have the honor, Your Highness, of pleasuring you in the American way? We have many means of pleasure.\" Henry said this was to deeply seal an attitude that Ameri ca equaled pleasure , so diplomatic relations would go smoother . He often called it, \"paving the way to diplomatic relations,\" and he used sex as a means to accompli sh that. The statement quoted above also allowed me to ask for permission, so as not to break cultural ru les without having set up a framework for taking the King into a different experience. I was told to strictly avoid oral sex until close to the end and then feel out if it was approp riate or would be accepted . Henry said, \" I wish I could give you precise instructions, but t he research team is only able to get certain data . Some is not available so I will have to trust your judgment along the way in some of these areas.\" And oral sex was one of those areas. In front of me , Henry explained to his research team that to get in close enough to someone who would have knowledge of that level o f intimate detail about a target would be a risk he would not want to take. I overheard him say, \"She will have to be briefed on the cultural mores and then her own expert skill and timing will have to take over in limited areas such as, if or not to offer o ral gratification.\" The research team was present often when I was prep ared or briefed for an assignment because each woul d often have their area of expertise to instill into me, es pecially in the area of foreign relations and cultu ral differences. The research team even had foreign members who Henry he avily relied upon for certain \"key\" countries he wa s targeting. These men often had been born in the for eign country and so could easily and accurately rel ay all customs. Henry explained, \" Every country of the world has different customs an d our job is to ensure that you are fully aware of those customs before you are sent in .\" The members of the team changed at times as we move d on to different countries. Henry had many ethnic traits, yet was polished to an almost non-cultural bias on the surface, so as not to be encumbered by his ethnicit y. He treated"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"each person as a challenge to face and beat, even i f they were from a culture he couldn't understand u ntil he studied it. The more exotic and different the culture, the better. Then, he would go to extremes to study it , in order to emerge the victor because he would understand them totally , often understanding them more than they did themselves. Henry usually won, and most people, totally unaware that there was a game of wits going on, would have sex with me for the night and not even know to take the message bait when I threw the line out . They were what Henry called \"simpletons.\" And he said he desp aired of them. At other times he was grateful for \" simpletons\" if they were in strategic positions and he could us e them in the power and control game. Then he did w hat he knew best researching until he devised the ideal strateg y, and finding the best person to pull it off. When he knew, he put the strategy through whomever would deliver it with the most favorable outcome. Within me he had two d istinctly different agents - one being Susan, the serious, co nscientious, motherly, intellectual, organized, lov ing and understanding type, and, Sharon, the clever and oft en humorous and entertaining sex slave and friend o f the elite. The World Health Organization The World Health Organization (WHO) was a cover for bringing together an inside group o f people whose purpose and intent was much different than what was generally thought and publicly portrayed . Lots of illegal activity went on without detection and across borde rs internationally as this inside group hid its covert operations under masked projects , purportedly for world advancement. Among other th ings, it was also a cover for drug deals, child prostitution, heinous experiments on human be ings, illegal sales of babies, etc . Some of the players I saw participating were a select group of politicians, c elebrities and leaders worldwide . I sat in on many meetings. I heard Ted Kennedy speak, as well as Henry Kissinger , and there was a group of women who worked for the WHO that did not seem to h ave a clue about what was actually going on behind the scenes. Many were naive, honest, pliable people and actuall y played into the hands of the corrupt inner group without being aware that they were being used . Masked behind the publicized \"do good\" activities were illegal ventures intended to fund this corrupt group, with their secret, hidden motives and agendas. So while the United States appeared to be having benevolent beliefs and actions, these activities were put into motion. They sent a group to \"aid\" children in foreign countries, but behind the scenes what was actually taking place was a mas ked drug connection or some other illegal enterprise that brought top dollar to this group of self-sele cted men who seek to eventually control the world. Some meetings of the WHO were televised, but the agenda the public saw a nd heard was not the complete agenda that was secretly carri ed out. I heard and recorded into my mind files, th e words that a man spoke. He was standing at a microphone in a lar ge room filled with row upon row of stationary, red upholstered wooden chairs, arranged in a semi-circu lar shape. I was there for Henry's usage of stored data in my \"government mind file system.\" I suppose an individ ual at these meetings who was not aware of this typ e of technology; using human beings for storing and hidi ng information known only to the National Security Agency and others, would have just assumed I was an aid or secretary to the UN, or an assistant to Kissinger. One day I heard a man state, \"Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak to the issue of free trade, internati onally, between countries.\" Most of the free trade these men were REALLY alludi ng to was in illegal drugs (cocaine, heroine), pornography, prostitution, and weaponry . They used anything that would cull large sums of money to fund their causes and their desires with no thought of the hum an or financial cost to others - like the violation of basic human rights - and had no regard to others' pain and suffering . These men had no scruples, no compassion or ability to empathize with the feelings of others; instead they were self-seeking and ruthless - without conscienc e . The following is an example of the kinds of flashes and memory retrieval that continued to flood into my m ind. One day, Bobby Baker , House Appropriations Committee was at a meeting. He was wearing a light tannish-brown suit and he argued with everyone about everything , and Henry felt he disrupted their meetings so that nothing ever got accomplished. Henry didn't like him at all. At another meeting, I heard, \"Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the subject of the arms control rac e,\" Baker said. Then he spoke of his concerns about Russia escalati ng the arms race, that they were gaining speed and technology at such a pace that we the United States would be i n serious jeopardy and at a disadvantage if we didn 't set up immediate appropriations for arms research and arms production. Baker appealed to the United States' f ear of being \"taken over,\" in order to get money appropriated fo r arms; when in fact, much of the funding was not u sed for what it was designated for, but instead was used in hidd en, covert activities for the benefit of the Counci l and those politicians that were supported by the Council."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" At the time, the World Health Organization was ofte n an excuse to bring together people from all over the world. This created an opportunity for the \"inside group\" to secretly meet and intertwine their agenda with t he public agenda of the WHO. Those in attendance who were una ware of the New World Order agenda, were also unawa re that there was a small cadre of people dominating t he group and making sure they had enough key player s on the panel or board so they could win when votes were ca st or decisions made. In those years, I was not abl e to understand these people or political issues in the general historic way that the public remembers or u nderstands. My perspective was solely from my personal experiences . I was generally programmed to not listen to polit ical information I heard or saw. Consciously, as my prog ramming dictated, I was not interested or involved in politics or public news in any way. So this information comes t o you, the reader, from my personal experience at t hese or other meetings. After I downloaded this data from my mind , I actually had to ask others, or research to find out what the common public historical belief was, as portrayed b y the news media back in those years. I believe most California Governors that I worked w ith were a part of the WHO and other such groups. I t seems to me that these men and their functionaries, who seek control, hook into every individual and key organi zation that they can use in order to maintain control of their interests. They were strategically placed, often un der the direction of Henry Kissinger and others, in order to insure t hey got what they wanted, when they wanted it. It was like a game to them, and they were all on the same team, in the same way a crime syndicate operates . Nuclear testing sites, Energy Commission, NATO, Council on Foreign Relatio ns, House Appropriations Committee on Foreign Trade , and the Trilateral Commission, were just some of th e organizations whose meetings Kissinger took me to , both in the U.S. and abroad. Henry used my mind files at me etings of the Trilateral Commission. We sat at a ta ble with a group of men. There were microphones sitting on the table. What went on behind the scenes at these mee tings often had nothing to do with what was outwardly portrayed . There were meetings within meetings and secret meetings were held behind the scenes of other credible publi c meetings. Often, the Council (not to be confused with the CFR) was involved in directing the way things went although no one knew they had any part in the outco me . They all spoke their lies publicly, often directed by Ki ssinger the strategist, Hope the entertainer, and t he Council from behind the scenes. Kissinger as Global Mastermind I was in Henry's office often in my final years of High School, while he worked heavily with Nixon on foreign relations. I would meet him in New York or in Washi ngton, DC. Sometimes the team would brief me a mont h in advance for different assignments, but Henry always said, \"It works best and is most ideal when she is prepared directly before the assignment and then goes from h ere.\" There was very little I knew to do on my own because the team had usually filled the agenda in order for me to deliver culturally specific or personally specif ic words and physical acts to entice the target. The team heavil y researched every detail and it sounded, from thei r conversations, like they used separate espionage agents to collect some data they didn't want to ever be connected to or associated with, as it would have completely blown their cover . Henry used every means available, even down to manipulating a person through his or her own religi ous beliefs . Henry's strength was that he was able to remain detached and able to pull from a wide variety of cu ltural differences in order to create the end produ ct. Whereas, he explained, most Americans just went in to grab for the product and failed, due to their lack of cultur al understanding. Henry said to me, \" The closer you can align yourself with the subject in every way, the more successful you will be . Therefore you have to know him or her as well as possible bef ore you are sent in and that is our job. You will o nly need to be the actress, the point person carrying o ut our plan. You will think only in this area we ar e working in. All else will fall away as you are focused only on this one particular area . You are beautiful, young, and have expanded sexual capabilities and we will supply the rest. All you have to do is receiv e the instructions.\" Henry Kissinger groomed me to be culturally adept w ith each foreign dignitary he sent me in to be with . He said, \"This is where the success rate lies - firmly in cu ltural understanding first, then complying with the ir culture's mores second, and third, is equally your physical attractiveness and your sexual expertise .\" "},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Henry told Nixon in my presence that this was the r eason for my success and he told Nixon that sometim es it took him hours to have his researchers gather the data n ecessary on a foreign target in order to begin to p repare me for the assignment. At one particular meeting, we sat a t a large table with a group of men and I was seate d next to Henry. President Nixon sat on the other side of Hen ry. Henry did not smoke his cigar at this meeting. Nixon told him it was much too sensitive a meeting and for som e reason Henry complied and didn't smoke. He usuall y smoked regardless of who objected. At key junctures in the meetings, Henry would reach over and push his fing er into the top of my hand. In response, I began reciting my pr ogrammed information or message. The message I deli vered at this particular meeting was in Chinese or Japanese and, since I did not consciously speak these langua ges, I had no way of knowing what the content of the message I wa s delivering was. At this specific meeting, the for eign leaders listened to my message, and spoke back directly to me. Although I did not understand, I smiled and loo ked at them as if I was very interested, like I had been instru cted to do. An interpreter would then translate the foreign leaders' response and then Nixon or Kissinger would speak. A t other meetings, sometimes the interpreters were w omen but mostly in that country they were men. Whatever messages I delivered seemed to be a soften ing agent in the talks because the foreign leaders always smiled or laughed . Sometimes, they were touched so deeply by whatever it was I was pre-programmed to say that they took my hand with tears in their eyes . Due to my lack of conscious knowledge of the diff erent foreign languages, I do not know what it all meant. If anyo ne ever questioned where Henry got me and how I was so advanced for my young age, Henry told them I was a child prodigy and that I had completed my universit y training abroad at a very early age and was good at my job, but socially shy. That explanation served to keep t hem from asking me questions later that I could not answer. Henry usually took me out of the meetings when they were over, in order to avoid situations where I would appear i gnorant, should anyone ask me questions with any su bstance to them. For the truth was that I attended public high school and later junior college and was of average intelligence. I just had the advantage of programmed capabilities t hat served the interests of my controllers. After w e broke for lunch, Henry took me to a pay phone and dialed a nu mber, and the person at that location began giving me additional data in the foreign language. I was inst ructed to remember what was said, verbatim. Each su bject was given a marker number for identification. Henry too k the phone, talked a bit, and jotted notes in a sm all black book, before he hung up. These foreign talks really chall enged Henry Kissinger and the Council, but they had done their homework. Kissinger did the same sort of diplomatic work with Reagan when he became President. At many of these talks those representing our count ry said we were creating peace, but what they were really doing was opening up trade with these foreign countries b ecause we needed resources they had. Our leaders tu rned it around to make it sound like the United States was doing them a big favor and we were being gracious t o them. Expensive gifts were often sent ahead to foreign le aders, to arrive just before the President did, but I think that is as far as the real favors went. There were times at ni ght in foreign countries, when I was programmed to have sex with Nixon. Then I was returned to sleep in Kissinger's room. Even though I was being used like a machine, I still had very sensitive olfactory senses and Henry Kissinger was at times nearly intolerable to share a room wit h because he smelled so bad from cigar smoke or gaseous explo sions that erupted from his body . I was taken in and out of Russia during the Nixon years with Kissinger to att end NATO meetings, SALT talks, peace talks, and the secret hidden meetings of the Council. Henry brought me to the meetings to recite any pert inent information I had stored in my \"mind files.\" It was easier to justify my presence to people like Nixon's wife after I started working with Henry. They would expl ain I was at a meeting because of my work with Henry or in prepara tion for an international trip. It worked the same way with Reagan, justifying my presence for business reasons , but I was mostly there to pass messages or keep t he President happy ...whatever it took. There were times when I was limoed to the airport and when Nixon stepped of f the plane after a foreign trip I would be in the back of the limo waiting for him. I was told to crouch down so there wouldn't be any way of spotting me and then Nixon would get in and give me a message for Henry or I'd give him a message and often we would have sex later. He would go to t he White House and shower and freshen up and I'd be held in a \"state of suspended animation\" unless there was ano ther job for me to do. I'd sit blankly for hours in the same place until I was directed that it was, \"time to move int o action.\" Henry Plays Chess with Real People "},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"During those years my work with Henry Kissinger and others continued, although Henry had to begin taki ng more of a back seat position in the public eye for awhil e after the Watergate scandal. His position within the outskirts of the Council did not change . He was an important man for them and they utilized him because he was an expert strategist . I do not know exactly what that meant but I heard many men say that about him over the years. I gues s it means Henry knows how to get people to move around and do things he says without them ever knowing the y are being manipulated or controlled ...like a puppet ma ster or chess master. Henry knew how to think ahead in regard to key moves with key players. I watched him. It was a kin to watching him play chess with real people. He knew how to get the desired outcome by motivating certain ke y players. He used researched information gathered on targeted individuals to manipulate them however he wanted, t hrough their own weaknesses, addictions and/or obse ssions. Targeted people did not even know that they were be ing influenced because he sent in people like me wh o looked naive and innocent, like they were just being kind or nice or sexy and cute or whatever was called for , but it was not really what was happening because there was always an ulterior motive beneath the seduction act or pla n. Henry and the men in suits always sent in the perfect mat ch. They hired whatever kind of girl or woman would turn their target on. Obviously, I was not \"hired\" or paid, I was just slave labor. I saw lists of \"programmed sl aves,\" with numbers by their physical descriptions, programmed expertise and usage capabilities, so they could be matched perfectly for certain situations. Unfortunately, th eir identities were in code. Henry said if you really wanted someone to believe you about something that was not true, you convey i t the first time as a Freudian slip . Then you attempt to conceal the fact you made the s lip , but you make another Freudian slip. Then you try to say what it was you were orig inally going to say and they believe the first stat ement regardless of your attempt to simply state the truth. Then Hen ry said the last line saves your neck legally. One day, I sat next to Henry Kissinger as we were seated before President Ford. Henry always said that he had to work harder than with any previous president to \"guide\" Ford where they w anted him to go. He said Ford kept going off in his own direction . Henry said he was glad Ford was not in office long . He said Nixon was easier for him to work with and guide. Henry thought Reagan was a \"bimbo\" and \"stupid ignoramus .\" Those were the words I overheard him use to describe Ronald Reagan to a group of men. But, when we met with the Presidents he never let on his tru e feelings. Instead, he always \"acted\" the role of diplomat all the way around so that the plans of the Council co uld be carried through as easily as possible. Henry Kissinger was known for looking at documents with a \"magnifyi ng glass .\" He was able to find loopholes and incorrect wordings that would not be to their a dvantage in agreements, treaties, etc., before the United States signed. He was very thorough. Often, I sat by him t he whole time he was reviewing a document so he cou ld reach over and tap me to gain access to some needed infor mation stored in my mind files. Henry was very slow, deliberate and methodical . He thought that way, talked that way and moved that way . He ate European-style with his fork upside down, like I was taught was bad manners. And , he was obsessed with business. He was usually ver y serious; I do not believe I ever truly saw him have any fun. He avoided social occasions whenever possible, atte nding when necessary to further political agendas or the cause of the New World Order . In the beginning Henry had to install huge amounts of data into me, but as time went on he didn't have to place in as much because the database was already in place. I h eard him explain this to people who were \"in the kn ow.\" I also overheard him say that a man might have served the purpose better because there were certain times he said my presence as a woman was questioned when the subject s were sensitive. I am sure they remedied this situation by programming more males for the job . Henry was less interested in how I looked and mor e interested in how I worked. For mind file use he programmed me to dress very tailored and conservative. They dressed me in attire to fit specific assignments. There must have been othe r girls and women being used for the same thing, in the same ways, because I heard Henry compare me, saying I wa s more reliable than the others--more able to captu re the details and never make mistakes. He used to say he was saving me for the important a ssignments because of my reliability . I now believe the fact that I was poly-fragmented contributed to my success. I could only be used on a limited basis because he was afraid there might be questions asked. To others, I just looked like I wa s smart. They did not know I wasn't operating in a conscious stat e, but instead had been programmed, drugged, and electroshocked to maintain THETA brainwave patterns used to retain the vast amounts of data and keep i t hidden from my conscious mind. He was proud of himself for the way he had loaded me up with data and could ac cess my mind files in public without others knowing what he was doing. He used different techniques over the y ears but one he was most proud of was what he called \"time progr ams.\" "},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Some mind files were organized by a numerical syste m and Henry could access them by calling out a cert ain number. He combined this concept with the time of d ay in order to remain less conspicuous. He would po int to his watch and say, \"It's 1:30,\" and that would correspo nd to file number 130 in my system of mind files an d gave him automatic access to that particular file. Henry tho ught the time reference to accessing my files was b rilliant. Using this method, no one could tell that he was doing an ything other than simply stating the time of day fo r that particular day or some other hypothetically scheduled date. Th is way his uninformed peers would not be able to fi nd out what he was doing and what type of secret technology he possessed. Henry had to be very cautious with whom he shared i nformation about me. Most people did not carry the clearance to be allowed to know about the top secret governme nt projects that created such technology as program med, robotical slaves. People saw me working with him at meetings and other places, but very few knew how I worked or that I was a government programmed robot. The only ones who I knew were aware of this technology were certain top politicians, Bob Hope, some of his 'cronies,' a nd the Council. Henry kept the technology very, ver y secret and if there were any problems with me while we were in pu blic, he would escort me out of the room and go abo ut resorting and/or refiling my mind files to get them straightened out. Henry gave me instructions at times from a closed c ircuit television before I was flown to DC, and at other times he waited and instructed me while I sat next to him at a round table with other men present. These four o r five other men in suits knew exactly what was going on and why I was being briefed. At times, each of them would have different input to instill into my head. After each had put in their information, I was told, \"And whe n the time is right, it will all come out just like clockwork.\" T hese were the words they used to program the correc t delivery of the material they had just instilled. They said I w as doing a good job in getting information from peo ple as well as delivering information. There were times when I was let out of the limo and escorted into the White Ho use by a Secret Service agent. This agent knew he was just \" acting\" as my escort for the evening, and would con veniently disappear when I was targeting some man (or woman) I was told to give a message to, and then the agent would reappear to take me home after I was finished. I wa s often dressed in very sexy evening gowns, gloves, and high heels. Sometimes the dresses were totally backless and I would be dressed in sexy nylons, undergarment s, just in case my assignment required later evening sexual at tention. I was taken to a beauty salon and had my h air, nails and make up done before being dressed. Sometimes the Se cret Service agents took me to get ready. There were times Henry gave me little pills and ins tructed me to slip them into my glove to use if the person I was targeting was not cooperating in giving up informat ion. I rarely found the pills necessary. After sex the men seemed to listen intently to the words I was saying to the m and would open up and give me the information I was instructed to get. Henry explained to the men in suits that I could say things after sex that \"influenced the men deeply.\" It was at the White House that I did my best work a nd met the people whom I was to influence or as the y called it...\"seed.\" Over time I learned that seeding meant to drop an idea that would start an individual thi nking in a certain direction that would support my controller's positi on. For example, information that would influence a person's thinking about upcoming legislation, or information (false or true) in regard to key individuals (poli ticians, leaders, wives, husbands, etc.). The White House was an easy place to work because t here were so many side rooms we could secretly slip into. Sometimes I would get some \"target\" into a room, li ke an office and lock the door behind us and seduce him right there. The men usually got very excited, especially if it was their first escapade . I would assure them that this little secret was safe with me because Senator so and so ( my escort) wouldn't like it if I was fooling around either. This assured them that 1, too, had a good reason to keep the secret to protect myself, which usually made t hem feel more willing to take the risk . Sometimes I had to take the targeted person outsi de the building to another location and have sex with them. That was a little trickier, but I could do it. As far as I know, the \"targets\" never did know that in having sex with me, they were really being taken ad vantage of, or politically raped and coerced by the Council itself - five men in suits who cleverly installed their own agenda . In this way, the Council controlled money and/or coerced many people in key places, often wit hout the person ever being aware of it. Henry usual ly seemed very proud of me after I delivered messages or extr acted information successfully from people. He acte d like a greedy old man when he debriefed me. Often, he insi sted on debriefing me himself because he said the w ords that came out of me were \"fresh\" in the first debriefing and were key to issues at hand. The debriefings co uld take up to an hour for just one evening spent with a targeted individual. Henry said I helped him do his best wor k. "},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" Accompanying Henry to Foreign Countries Sometimes when Henry and I traveled internationally the time difference worked in his favor. For insta nce, we could leave after I got out of school on Friday, re ach our foreign destination the next morning and it would still be Friday when we arrived. Henry worked it so I wouldn 't miss more school than necessary, and he made sur e I slept on the 8-12 hour flight. We always flew first class when we flew as private citizens. At other times w e flew on military or government aircraft during times he was in public office. There were occasions when I woul d leave school and fly with Henry, or my mom would put me o n a plane and I would meet Henry somewhere like New York and then we would fly the rest of the way toge ther. Once seated on the flight, he would press the top o f my hand and I would go to sleep as commanded . When he pressed my hand in surroundings where I h ad been commanded many times for the same thing, he didn't have to give commands - like sleep. I automatically knew, so over time, things became pretty routine. I didn't e at while we were out of the States, when we only we nt for one meeting and were gone 24-48 hours. He would simply tell the stewardess I was sleeping and my sleep was more important than food. So she would bring him food an d I would sleep. And although I was asleep, I was a ware of what happened around me; I was recording, as comman ded. There were occasions that we didn't fly back in tim e for me to go home and I was taken by limo directl y to Taft High and dropped off a block away from the school t o walk the rest of the way, just before school bega n on Monday morning. Henry took me to France, at times to Marse illes in the South of France, to meetings of the el ite. We often met with bankers, as well as other leaders and key businessmen . They met at round tables and each pulled papers from their briefcases to share . Henry sat his briefcase by his side on the floor because he had me and had little need for papers unless they were presented merely for th e effect that it would have to help influence someo ne. If papers were needed, he always had the best, the neatest, c leanest, most professional paperwork money could bu y. Everything was planned for effect . He gave varying reasons for my presence, explaini ng when asked who the young lady was, that I was his personal secretary a nd that I was advanced far beyond my years and was quite a help to him. When he began the meeting, if none of the m en objected to my presence; as instructed, I sat ne xt to Henry and took notes. While I appeared to simply be takin g sketchy notes in shorthand at the meeting, when h e debriefed me later on, he had me recite, verbatim, what each and every man said at the meeting. Henry liked for me to be present at meetings when he felt that sort of infor mation could later be important for his use. Henry loved to come out of meetings and go immediately back to his room to debrief me. He would sit at a table writing dia grams as I recited what I had heard. Then he would have more d ata to use to strategize with. If there was to be a second follow- up meeting, he would be on top, ready to drop his c arefully planned ideas and solutions into the meeti ngs with foreign leaders or businessmen. Henry called this \"International Business .\" At times when I was sent alone, he said the informa tion he got was better than if he had gone himself, \"because it is distilled,\" he explained. So he sent me to many loc ations as a \"presidential model\" to Presidents, and to many leaders at parties at the Rockefeller's and Bob's, and also sent me abroad. I knew whom I was to target, because Henry had shown me a picture before . I was sent to foreign embassies to entertain foreig n ambassadors that were working for Henry . Often they worked for the United Nations in order to have some peace-loving humanitarian effort that justified the U.S. presence in a foreig n country , and then Henry and the others would go about doin g their real business. There were other times we traveled b y trains in different countries like Russia and Hen ry would debrief me in his private compartment. We slept on the train and traveled to meetings during the dayti me. Henry said the food was bad, so he would often bring some of his own food in a brown paper bag that he kept in his briefcase. At the meetings he didn't need papers be cause I was with him. People thought he was really smart and had an excellent memory because of that. It got to the point where I could literally \"read his mind,\" as he termed it, and give him a simple answer on paper that others w ouldn't see and then he would take off on the data or idea. We also traveled to China (both sides), Japan, Engl and, France, Italy, Israel, Germany, and wherever e lse he needed to go to do his \"International Business.\" Often whe n Henry was extended an invitation to attend a soci al event in a foreign country, he declined saying he was tired an d suggested they take me instead. Then he got what he really wanted anyway - the information from them without h aving to expend social energy to get it. Then, befo re I went he loaded me up with questions to ask the leader and i nstructions about the stance I was to take sexually with him or her. Dressed in appropriate clothing, I was off. Th ere were bullfights with leaders in Spain, polo gam es to watch Prince Charles, and golf with others. The events I attended were indigenous to the individuals and the ir countries."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" At the end of trips abroad, if there wasn't a McDon ald's to help me remember that I was really in Cali fornia (wink), then there had to be some type of trauma to seal th e experience off from my conscious awareness. Henry had others perform the trauma; he wouldn't do it . He said it was out of his league. So the men that accompanied him \"took care of me\" when the need arose. When we finally arrived at McDonald's, I was usually starving. There, I wa s told I was in Woodland Hills in order to “re-mind” me to forge t. McDonald's spelled safety and the end of my assignment . Because I was a robot, and so, \"security proven,\" I was allowed to function as the go between for Henry and the Council . They even gave me things to bring back to Henry t hat couldn't be safely delivered any other way. I was flown to remote places to meet with them and then f lown back for debriefing by Henry . He always seemed so pleased with the information, like he was getting j ust what he wanted. The Council often sent messages to people directly, bypassing Kissinger . When I would deliver the message I would tell them it was from \"the group .\" That was how the Council often identified themselves to insiders who knew how the group functioned, but did n't know their actual identities. Over the years they changed their 'nickname' so as not to be conspicuous . From my perspective, no one in government office knew as much about mind control as Henry Kissinger . They might have been told \"the basics\" but it didn't seem like most of them were aware of the extent to which a person could be enhanced with programming and used especially that an individual could possess the capability of organ izing and recording the conversations of a whole group of peo ple at a meeting. Kissinger: The Council's Top Dog One time at a Gubernatorial Ball, Henry got very ma d at Ted Kennedy because Ted tried to take me off to another room to have sex with him. Henry got very angry with Ted who was a Senator at that time and threatened him w ith exposure if he did not back off . As a result, Kennedy left me alone, at least for that evening. At other times Ted Kennedy forced me into very violent and sadisticall y torturous sex. It was often scary for me when Hen ry wasn't around to make sure certain people didn't rough me up. Bob Hope didn't seem to care or at least he didn't watch me as closely as Henry did when I was with him, but H enry did not seem to know this. Bob lied to him sometime s about who I was seeing, and sometimes Bob used me with people Henry wasn't supposed to know about . Bob had his own separate interests in using me wi th people who would benefit him but Henry told Bob what to do as far as government issues went. Bob was just a useful servant who had a lot to offer ...connections, money, fame, and slaves . Bob suited Henry's needs to a tee, handling the s ocial scene and celebrities. Bob's social elite contacts greatly added fuel to Kissinger's long range plans as he found places to use different people of influence in stra tegic positions. He just waited for the right oppor tunity to arise. Henry didn't view the President as anyone necessarily hav ing any power . He knew how they were manipulated and he liked to be the one who was pulling the strings . He told me once that ambassadors to foreign countri es have more power and control than the President of the United States . I didn't understand then what he was talking abou t, but just listened and nodded. Henry was the top dog as far as the Council was concerned . He had the mind they needed that could so carefully strategize plans far in advance and so he usually g ot the desired results . In the Council's eyes, Rockefeller was more dispensable because he had money and power but didn't have the mastermind that they saw in Henry . So Henry was given everything he needed in order to fu lfill their plan. If he wasn't in office it didn't much matter - he always had access to the person sitting at the reig ns of political power. Behind the scenes, Henry con trolled decisions and actions taken by the State Department in matters of foreign relations, always attempting to bring about a situation where the Council was in total co ntrol globally . They saw it as a game, a lifelong plan, with the outcome hopefully being that, finally, this generat ion of the global elite would succeed in the game t hat their forefathers had not been able to pull off . It created ambition and drive among them. All I saw these men do was manipulate and control p eople by covert means . It seemed that most people they targeted had no idea they were even being manipulat ed or set up . When a country needed some shoring up, messages, or coercion to further the implementation of their plan, then they would send Henry or me or both of us, depending on the importance of the situation. I was merely an extension of Henry, delivering \"strategi c influence\" in ways he said he never could. He felt that he wou ld have more influence with many of the men he want ed to"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"coerce or manipulate to see or do things his way by sending in a soft, cuddly, human sexual toy. He of ten joked with insiders that his sphere of influence was limited b ut he could use me to get in those \"hard to get places .\" Henry said I could make those men twist into a pret zel and so he used me in many foreign countries to tap into vast resources, the human resources he needed to puppet . He felt that those human resources would lead to natural resources and that's where the money would be. Henr y was often referred to among the insiders as a \" genius of his time .\" So the presidents came and went but Henry was there be hind the scenes molding me, with Bob's help, for the Council benefit. Mind control was the secret weapon that Henry perfected over the years. Usually the i ndividual would be so busy focused on what was planned that h e would miss the hidden agenda that was taking plac e. Henry loved this tactic. Sometimes these guys would be ta ken into Henry's confidence (the oldest trick in th e world to get people to be on your side, and feel important so th ey will cooperate) and told I was an espionage oper ative, but he didn't tell them my capabilities so they wouldn't b e able to imagine what I was really doing or what I was capable of. Henry and Bob often did deals together, sometim es involving \"influencing\" our troops overseas, or influencing a Senator, Governor, celebrity, a President, or a wor ld leader. Sometimes Henry Kissinger told Bob Hope to make certain connections for me in regard to people I wa s to be placed with in and out of California. \"I am the light of the world. He that follows Me sh all not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\" -- John 8:12 Chapter Thirteen Bob Hope “Let me entertain you.” Bob Hope involved me with many celebrities. His par ties were star-studded, filled with the glamorous, the famous, the rich. If people did not have a title or talent they could buy themselves into his circle of \"exclu sive people.\" ZaZa Gabor was often in attendance. Lucille Ball was his friend also. She was often drunk. Also pre sent were Peter Finch, Alan Arkin, Dezi Arnez, Bernadette Peters, S uzanne Sommers -to name a few. Bob rarely drank at his own parties. Perhaps he wanted to stay in control. One night at a party, the trees outside began movin g from a helicopter downdraft. Lights from the grou nd illuminated the helicopter and the extravaganza tha t followed. It was an extraordinary show. Guests we re gasping, \"Oooh, ahhh,\" as they watched beautiful women dropp ed by tether down into the party, wearing very skim py, elaborate, glittery costumes that were set aglow by the lights. Bob liked fanfare. Some of the women w ore only body glitter in scant places. The \"elite,\" as they were often called, were encour aged to choose a girl, any girl they wished for their 'personal party favor' and enjoy h er as they wished . Girls in skimpy aprons, but otherwise naked, served champagne and chocolates on silver platters. If a man wanted her in addition to the candy or dr ink, she complied. Every desire, every whim was satisfied. These girls were totally compliant . At times, children were there . After I had children, sometimes even my daughter Ke lly was there to be used. The children were held in reserve in a back room for men with 'alternate' sexual preferenc es. From a very early age my daughter was well-trai ned sexually, just like the other children. It was all very bad, but Bob's contacts were paid—in favors or connections. Bob didn't need money, but connections always came in handy. At many of Bob's parties there were no ru les, no restrictions, no boundaries. Sex was allowed anywhe re and everywhere. To partake only required an oath of secrecy. And many partook. Bob was in charge of me at these times, but I also had an alternate agenda as dictated by the Council . I was often preprogrammed to target certain key individuals at these parties that they wanted to influence . Some people spent the night at Bob's house if they were too tired to go home. U.S. Senators like Alan Cranston , governors, congressmen, celebrities, even foreign ambassadors and dignitaries, were in attendance at different ti mes. Military people, also. People were invited if they had something to offer to Bob or \"the cause\"... the New World Order . Reagan attended Hope's parties at times. So did Nancy . When the parties were over, Bob liked for me to sit on his lap and feed him his favorite piece of See' s candy, followed by what he called, \"his favorite piece of ass.\" He always laughed when he said, \"You feed me and I'll feed you.\" But I never got to eat the candy, only him."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" Bob liked for me to take off his watch (per program ) while I was sitting on his lap and carefully put it on the table by the chair. He loved it when I was silly and gigg ly and teased him, but he did not like me to carry that attitude to bed. Bob always asked me to do things nicely the fi rst time. He said, \"There won't be a second time .. .that you'll remember,\" and he held up the zapper (stun gun). So me nights he teased me and said it was really just a bug zapper, but then it would bite me, and it hurt. In bed I wa s supposed to be serious and passionate, not silly. He would say, \"Show me your tail feathers,\" and I would take off my panties and turn around. Then he would hold me o n either side of my hips to \"examine the merchandise,\" and g ive it a \"stamp of approval,\" which was a spankie. Bob loved to give me spankings, not real hard ones, just enough to activate my sex program. Bob liked for me to put on the pretty lacy nighties or teddies he left out for me. So I did. He had a butler who would bring him drinks or whatever he wanted before bed – he often liked a \"hot toddy.\" If he wanted a regul ar drink, he would have me pour it for him from crystal decanter s that he had in his room. Bob snored at times whil e he slept. I was usually taken away early the next morning, some times even before Bob woke up. The butler or some o ther man in a suit would come to get me and deliver me to th e waiting limo. Sometimes I would fly home by plane , but was often helicoptered. Endless songs that commanded my mind played inside my head at appropriate times to 're-mind' me. When I was taken to the Palm Springs area the s ong lyrics, \"In the desert you can't remember your name... \" helped me forget - until I remembered. Pornography, Hollywood Style Late at night, I was programmed to walk out of our Woodland Hills home and down a block or so to Royar Street where a black sedan picked me up and whisked me to Universal Studios or other locations, to work for B ob filming porn. The sedan took me through a chain link fence and past a security booth where the driver had to s top and check in with the guard to gain clearance to the lot. The n he dropped me off in front of a very plain-lookin g building, with just a door to it. There were wooden step platforms up to the door. Bob often watched while pornography was filmed . They usually filmed at night so they would have, \"more freedom,\" as Bob would say. Men at the studios, wea ring t-shirts and jeans, dressed me in all kinds of sexy garments and made my body up with all kinds of make -up. One night a man handed me a beautiful, thick w ooden and gold hanger from which hung a small teddy made of nothing but a series of vertical strips of ribbo n that created a see-through effect. Bob followed me into the dres sing room while I slipped on black stockings, garte r belt, heels and then the teddy. The black-ribboned teddy was be lted at the waist but I was naked underneath and yo u could see through and between all the ribbons. I was instruct ed to lay out and get a suntan before filming, and I wasn't allowed to have tan lines on my back or shoulders. They put makeup on my breasts so I would appear tan all over. The make up they put on my body was really put on h eavy and was very itchy and uncomfortable. The oily kind was less itchy but didn't stay on as well as the dr ier type. There was another man who did my hair, often in cur ls or in a side ponytail. They used curling irons a nd designed all sorts of hair creations. I just sat there while they chose how I would appear; my hair, nails, toe nails, make-up, and costumes. And then, I did whatever they told me to do. Finally, they draped me with whatever jewel ry they decided on. At times body jewels were glued onto my body. Once they glued little sparkly rhinestones a ll over my skin and filmed me in a skimpy white bikini-type ou tfit. The costumes were always different, unique an d original. Bob wanted me to be like Dorothy Lamour , but I didn't know who she was. He talked about lo ts of old actresses that I'd never heard of. There were lights and came ras all over the place in the halls, and backstage was full of all sorts of costumes on racks. Bob liked pornography w ith feathers so he had a man work with me on the ac t, including songs and dances. Bob said it was, \"porn for the sophisticates, not just for low-lifers.\" Bo b saw pornography as an art form and went into a very dee ply loving, emotional mode while it was filmed. Whe n they finished filming that's when he wanted me the most. Another man was assigned to \"work me up,\" training me for the act. This porn was filmed Hollywood-styl e all the way, with glitter, diamonds, flair, special props a nd stage lighting. I usually sang beforehand and Bo b made sure that I had a pre-recorded voice tape so I could sin g but not have to be concerned with putting power b ehind my voice while I was doing the sexual acts. The whole show was directed by another man who told the male porn actor and I what to do. The prop man listened to the dire ctor and moved props all around, while the camera a nd lights"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"men fell in line. There were many different themes and many nights when pornography was filmed. One ni ght Bob showed Hugh Hefner some of his porn in the back room at one of Bob's p arties . I was in the room, but Bob acted like I wasn't real or really there. I was. USO Tours In my late teens and early 20's I was taken aboard U.S. Navy aircraft carriers when Bob was doing a sh ow on his USO tours, to \"entertain the troops.\" I had several personalities who were specially trained to sing a nd dance, and many personalities who were expertly trained to dan ce and strip. Usually Bob and I were flown into a b ase and then helicoptered the rest of the way to the ship. On tour with Bob there were large bands, with lots of music and lights. Red, white, and blue banners d ecorated the stage where we performed. Sailors stood packed toge ther to watch the show. If the media was there Bob totally controlled what they captured on camera, what segme nts could be filmed, and when they had to leave. On e time when I came out on stage, they began shooting my pa rt, and after the show Bob had a huge fit (he could be very temperamental) and threatened to break their equipm ent on the spot if they didn't give him the film. T hey gave him the film. This way Bob controlled what was shown to the general public. The shows usually took place o n the outside decks. Professional make-up artists made up my whole body. For one show, I was dressed in a wh ite 'navy' dress, only it wasn't like the regular standard uni forms the women in the navy wore. It was a speciall y sewn costume, short and extra feminine with lace top and scoop neckline. I had special white lace panties w ith little anchors on them. For one show I sang Anchors Away a fter which Bob would \"joke them!\" What the \"boys\" d idn't know was that Bob knew how to control their emotion s with certain specific words and phrases and songs . He knew how to \"lighten them up,\" get them really \"emotiona l\" and worked up, and then he would slip in suggest ions, keyed to programs, that \"helped them with certain unwante d attitudes.\" I overheard the Council making jokes about the \"herds\" (the troops) and how stupid and easily led they were . At the shows where I was present, singing usually c ame first, then Bob's jokes, and then another song and dance. Once I did a semi-strip dance, never \"took it all o ff\" for \"the boys.\" In order to project a semblance of 'wholesomeness,' I just stripped down to skimpy bra s and panties, and also took off my heels, dress, n ylons and garter belt. I was instructed to wear those for \"th e effect\" of taking them all off. After shows, some times I was taken to the Admiral's and/or Captain's quarters to furth er \"entertain\" him in the privacy of his room. These officers displayed attitudes created by years and years of b eing honored with medals and ribbons for \"service t o the country.\" The Council often slipped messages to Naval officers, through m e, possibly without the officers' knowledge . I never knew my exact location; I was not allowed to know. We entertained the Air Force and Army, also, but I was used more often with the Navy. Bob took me to a specific recording studio in Southern California to pre-record the songs I was to sing before doing a s how for \"the troops.\" In the recording studio, I wo re headphones that played back into my ears the music I was singi ng so that I could stay in tune. I enjoyed singing and the studios could make anyone's voice sound good, but Bob liked me to sing soft, breathy, high and sexy. Sometimes , in the beginning, he would sit just outside the recording room where he could hear the music and would cue me so we could get it just right. Once I was programmed to s ing The Star Spangled Banner, in a really sexy mann er for the troops. When it was time to sing it live, they play ed the tape and I sang along, because it was hard t o sing and dance at the same time and maintain good voice quality. I n this way, I could put my all into dancing, splits and all, without being concerned with the song. (You can imagine my amazement when I began healing and integrating pers onalities and discovered I could do the splits! I never consc iously knew that I could do that.) I found the lights that shone on us while performin g to be blinding. Bob taught me to not look into th em but to look past them so they would not bother me so much. Anot her time when I went with Bob to entertain the troo ps, they wrapped me in an American flag. I had on a tiny spa rkling, red, white, and blue lacey bikini and spark ling red high heels. Two soldiers, in green army uniforms and boo ts held me up, one holding onto my feet and the oth er holding me up around my shoulders. As they turned me, the f lag unfolded off of me and slowly I was unfurled to bright lights and lots of soldiers yelling, whistling and cheering. In addition to the entertainment, this wa s part of my 'spin programming.' Bob had the microphone and had been t elling jokes, but stopped as they unrolled me. He p ointed to me while the drums rolled. When I was unfurled, the y played The Stripper and I danced around while all of the guys cheered. "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"For other shows, I had a feather plume on my bottom that went up my back. The costumes were always dif ferent. I rolled around on the floor, did the splits and \"spr ead 'em,\" as instructed, for the boys. Sometimes I sang, sometimes I just danced, and sometimes for smaller private au diences, I stripped all the way. And there were tim es I was just there to dance seductively for Bob's personal and p rivate pleasure later on in the evening. After the show, some man would put a prod or stun gun to my forehead. I tota lly collapsed into his arms and he carried me over and laid me down until it was time to leave. The physical sensa tion I experienced was a jolt of white-hot electric ity, and then I felt very, very cold. This was the reaction to the electroshock. The man delivering the electricity al so delivered programming to me. Before and after he zapped me, h e said, \"You are fat and ugly and no man could ever be attracted to you.\" As commanded, I carried the beli ef that I was fat and ugly and I never would have b elieved I was attractive enough to perform on stage, had I begun to remember. They would zap me with electroshock ei ther on the forehead, the base of my skull, or on my back or th ighs. For some reason on this occasion, Bob laughed just before they zapped me. He had some goon do it - he rarely did. I was often in very poor condition when we were hel icoptered away and Bob laughed and made excuses for my listlessness, saying things like, \"Ah, don't worry about her, the kid's just had too much to drink.\" T ruth was I wasn't even allowed to drink, not even water. My physical reactions were all from the aftereffects of the ele ctroshock intended to erase my memory. Another show I was tak en to was for the boys in the Army. Bob wore an Arm y uniform, just like the soldiers, and made jokes abo ut being just like \"one of the fellas\" in his unifo rm. They loved it and cheered. Bob could get away with saying just ab out anything to them and they would laugh. When he introduced me, he said, \"Watch this little one shak e her tail feather!\" I came out with a glittery bra and a g-string with tail feathers attached to the back. I danced c arrying matching purple feathers in my hands and pl aced them over my breasts and then turned around and held them ove r my bottom. When I was winding down my act, I was instructed to distribute all but the last of the fe athers to soldiers in the audience and then turn my back to them, spread my legs far apart, turn my head and say, \"So rry boys, I need to leave something to keep me warm !\" I felt like I was on lots of naval bases in the Uni ted States at some time or another. Sometimes for e ntertaining \"the boys\" with Bob, but more often for programming. The programming at these bases was torturous. I was hung upside down in tanks filled with water or gases . There also were chairs with straight backs and arm rests, with bands that fit tightly around my forehead, wrists and ankles . They also used electroshock and light and sound equ ipment, combined with food and sleep deprivation . I was subjected to lots of high tech equipment and machines . I didn't have a clue what these machines actually did or why my controllers were torturing me with them. Bonded To Bob Bob took me with him to lots of places when I was 1 6 to 21 (1967-1972). Wherever we were, or whomever I was to be with, I usually came with the silver limo. I wou ld be held in the back and no one from the outside could tell I was there. I was accustomed to performing oral sex to w homever I was instructed, and in limos and public p laces it meant swallowing. As a result I would become sick s ome days when there were a lot of men \"to do.\" Some times the limo would be full of Bob's friends and I would be told to wait in the back after a premier, gala or s how openings, etc. Bob would bring his friends \"along for the rid e\" and they got to \"sample his goodies\" is what he would say to his friends. One evening at a Hollywood event that took place in front of Gromin's Chinese Theatre , Elizabeth Taylor looked curiously past Bob as he stood in front of the entrance to the limo I was \"parked\" in. She ask ed him who I was. Then she made fun of him, saying, \" Couldn't you at least get one that doesn't look lik e a child? She doesn't even have any breasts !\" They didn't seem to get along too well . My programming made me feel bonded to Bob Hope. Alm ost like being married or comfortable being with hi m, like it was second nature to be with him. I was pro grammed to know what he liked so I could easily ple ase him. He liked to find me in his bathtub, full of bubbles, g iggling and happy and ready for him. He liked for m e to take off his shoes, rub his (smelly) feet, inch up his legs, unz ip his pants, and perform oral sex, but stop just b efore he orgasmed and wait a while before continuing. Following progr am command, I sat on his lap, kissed him, and told him how handsome he was, as he sat in his favorite winged b ack chair in his room. He had a footstool that I sa t on to rub his feet. Bob did not always want sex actually, but alw ays liked to be reminded of it by talking about sex ual things or how young I was. He loved young women and I was jus t that, and always was young to him because he was older than the hills! He was older than my father. He cou ld have been my grandfather, with nearly a 50 year age difference between us. I had been trained all my li fe to please older men. I knew just how to treat th em, flatter them,"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"and make them feel good, psychologically and, of co urse, physically. Bob sexually desired me from ages 16-20 or so, after that he just had sex with me, almost as a convenience to him. When I married, his sexual des ire seemed to change. During my teen years he'd take me around to friends, parties, clubs, and he bragged to whomeve r he was with, that he still got the 'young stuff.' I do not remember ever being involved in satanic trauma with Bob . But he must have known and liked what it created from my c hildhood years. He was above the trappings of satanism, like most of the higher ups . They looked at people who practiced satanism as low level , but the job had to be done (trauma base for mind control) and they rationalize d it by saying, \"look how beautifully she turned ou t.\" [This confirms my belief that the Pharisees who con trol all secret societies, has entrapped the GOYIM into satanic worship. Henry Kissinger is one of the hierarchy of manipulator’s “Council of 9 unknown men” [comprised of 9 Jewish families] (ref: G S Lawrence’s Dissipation of Darkness) – MC] Bob's Parties I had lots of party girl personalities programmed for Bob. Bob spent a greater amount of time with me when I was a teenager, until I was married. The personalities dedicated and devoted to Bob were clever and programmed with silly jokes for Bob's company. Bob liked me to start the parties out right, so guests were served mixed drinks, champagne, hors d'oeuvres, etc. Then Bob had me entertain in skimpy little outfits he provided, such as a red leotard, with netting around my wrist, red fishnet stockings and red sparkly high heels. I'd sing and dance and would strip if it was an appropriate time. One of the first times Bob had me start the party, he said, \"You took control of the room!\" He seemed surprised. When I stripped in front of couples, I did a lot of the same 'couple bonding' techniques that I did with couples in the intimacy of their own bedrooms. I was programmed to say something about the husband to the wife like, \"God you have good taste in men! I wish I could find one like this.\" And while I said it, I would lasso him with a silk scarf or feathers and pull him close, usually to my bare navel or chest. Or I'd say to the husband, \"You have won the charms of one of the most beautiful women in the world! You must be quite a man.\" And I would go on and on whispering, as if just to them, yet still having everyone in the room watch. Usually, unless Bob said it wasn't appropriate, I'd eventually strip and it seemed to loosen everyone up and very often I invited them if they cared to, to join me. It was usually like watching a group of little kids doing something naughty. Everyone would stand up and start getting naked, pulling off their clothes and throwing them all over the floor. Then they would go skinny-dipping or off to a side room for sex. People later told Bob the experience really stimulated their sexuality and they had not had such great sex in 20 years of marriage. Different nights brought different types of people together, usually carefully matched and pre-selected so they would congeal. Most of the couples were usually older and the men were businessmen, politicians, bankers, stock brokers, movie and music artists, and other people that were important to Bob's interests. The parties' guest lists were planned and coordinated to match up and networ k people who they needed to get together, or groups with similar sexual preferences like gays, lesbians, het erosexuals, or pedophiles, so they could feel free to let their hair down . Unfortunately, after it happened Bob owned them. Often, people did drugs at Bob's if they wanted to. At some parties, drugs and alcohol were in large suppl y, usually in labeled dishes or on little platters. Everything had little ribbon identifier tags or small signs, \"so p eople knew what they were getting into,\" Bob would say. For some private parties, Bob had me act like I was his dummy and he would load me up with most of the lines so he wouldn't have to think so much or memorize the j okes. He often had me say the key lines so he could easily bounce off of them and deliver a one liner. He dres sed me in skimpy clothes and he put his hand up my back like he was making me move like a dummy. He did that dummy gig often or had me mime with him or mime alone. Wh en people got high they really liked the mime act, esp ecially if there were strobe lights flashing on and off. Bob usually had some real maids who were older and who really cleaned and served. I only had to do tha t if it was the way they (Henry, Bob, and the Council) had plan ned for me to go in on a target. For example, I wou ld serve the target champagne with two strawberries in it, and t hen I'd say to him, \"Could I eat your...(pause).... uh...strawberry?\" I'd wiggle all over and smile or giggle. Sometimes the men would blush, but usually they would smile a nd say,"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"\"Why yes!\" As programmed, I would take the man's dr ink and take him by the hand to a side bedroom and say, \"Can I suck your '----' now?\" Then I'd perform as p rogrammed. To cover himself, Bob had me say, \"Please don't tell Mr. Hope about this .\" But other times Bob told me to say, \" Bob wanted to share with you the pleasure he gets o n a regular basis .\" It all depended on the angle they were using acc ording to the information that had been gathered on the man prior to the evening. Before I left the roo m I was instructed to show the man to the adjoining bathroom and shower, and offer him towels, combs, deodorant, dry ers, etc., anything he might need to freshen up, an d I'd explain he was free to rest, sleep or shower. If it was a serious target for the Council , I would stay with the man longer, sometimes all night and at times I was instructed to take him away fro m the party, somewhere quiet, where it was just the two of us. I would take him wherever I was instructed - to a hotel, park, beach, restaurant, disco, etc. If it was a serious target they got the red carpet treatm ent , if not they still got sex. Prince Charles was the red carpet sort, where minor politicians or businessmen were l ess catered to . At other parties I carried a silver tray with a gla ss of champagne on it and I'd have a cherry stem wi th a cherry dangling out of my mouth. Seductively I would say, \"Would you like a cherry, sir?\" and then I'd take h im to another room for sex. Or I'd put a very expensive gourmet c hocolate truffle in my mouth and say to a target, \" Would you like one of these?\" as I slowly and sensually took it in and out of my mouth, sucking and licking it, and if he said yes, I would put it on the edge of my lips and say, \"Oops, this is the last one, do you share?\" If he indicted he did, I would lean over and share it with him. Then I'd ask him if he wanted seconds and if he said yes, I wou ld take him off for sex. Other occasions, with a slice of peach in my mouth, I was programmed to ask, \"Would you l ike a California peach?\" and then I'd give it to him, in the bedroom. Henry told Bob the strategies and they often worked together to c reate a script for me to deliver , especially if jokes were needed. If it was intricate or complicated, th en Henry did the uploading. Sometimes though, for B ob's parties, Bob would load me up with statements for different people before the party began. He had a list of par ty guests and he often had his writers come up with something cle ver and funny along the subject lines Bob chose. I remember hearing him call different writers to chew them out if they were late delivering the scripts or if he was unhappy with the material they came up with. The Council used Bob and Henry together and was able to achiev e enormous strides because people oftentimes didn't realize they were connected, or that Bob and Henry were strategizing or manipulating them, let alone that they were connected to the Council. Bob's Political Connections Bob was involved in local, state, national and inte rnational politics and had a network of \"cronies\" a ll around the world. He would 'scratch their backs' for the same in return. Since he wielded so much political power , because of his wealth and connections, people listened to him and often did what he asked. Most people were bough t. He had a network of people (politicians, judges, police, etc .) in his back pocket and in this way he remained p rotected and often operated above the law. He seemed to know eve ryone everywhere we went and people seemed anxious to get near him. He had the money to buy anything he liked , including programmed sex slaves. Once he told me, \"everyone has his or her price,\" and he usually fou nd it. It was not always money that people were aft er; sometimes it was connections, fame or sex. By the time I was 18, I was in operation heavily wi th Bob Hope, California Governor Ronald Reagan, Pre sident Richard Nixon, and Henry Kissinger. They all knew I had what they called \"expanded faculties.\" I was o ften used as an intermediary between Sacramento and the White Ho use - keeping information flowing per instruction f rom the Council. They were the top controllers. So, for exa mple, during the time Reagan was Governor of Califo rnia, I was flown to Reagan's ranch to have sex with him and de liver him messages. Then I was flown to the White H ouse to have sex with Nixon and deliver messages from the C ouncil. The Council was overseeing all this. They d ebriefed me after each assignment and reprogrammed me in lig ht of the information I reported. I don't know if Reagan or Nixon really ever knew to whom I was really reporting .. .whose interests I was really addressing . The Council always made it look like I was attending to Reagan or Nixon's sexual interests and then subtly slipped in messages or suggestions from the Council. My programming 're -minded' me, \"Mine is not to question why, mine is but to do or die\". "},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"I was only 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 years old when I was performing many of these earlier sex/espionage miss ions. It was the perfect cover. Who would have suspected me, a v ery average, innocent looking, silly, young blonde to have been involved in U.S. Government and Shadow Governm ent activities? Ronald Reagan and Bob Hope were connected through t he entertainment field and were doubly connected th rough their political and military friends when Reagan wa s Governor of California and later on when he becam e President of the United States. Bob was also friends with high-powered men like Walter Annenberg , who had a sweeping estate in Palm Springs, or more specifically Rancho Mirage . When Bob took me there for meetings or parties I was told, \"This is a mirage, this just a mirage.\" Walter Annenberg was at one time an Ambassador to Britain and was also connected to the Reagan's and the British Roya l Family. Bob was politically connected and knew how to lure people in and insure they would work for him. He invited them to his parties and dangled various kinds of illegal or immoral perversions in their faces . Once their perversions were uncovered, he could blackmail or control them . That is how Bob worked. Bob was very good at this . I watched him do it to people over and over. He lured them in, de tected their weaknesses, then used that knowledge i n his favor, for his connections, and ultimately for his persona l gain. He was like a black widow spider, luring pe ople into his web and then moving in for the kill. Except instead of killing his prey he simply put them to good use in his life. He used them \"in the scheme of things,\" he would say, \"to make life a little easier .\" Once lured into Bob's snare, there was no getting o ut without dire consequence . Bob especially liked to do this to politicians because as he would explain to me after a party, he liked \"to have a few key politicians i n his back pocket.\" Bob demonstrated my \"abilities\" to people he wanted to gift me to. He gave me as a sexual gif t to a lot of people he wanted to \"have in his back pocket.\" Late r, he talked about how incredibly stupid these peop le were, to take the drugs or alcohol and then make a public sp ectacle of themselves. J. Edgar Hoover J. Edgar Hoover was at Bob's parties . One night he ended up dressed in a blue sequined dress. Henry and Bob had put together a list of other politicians who were l ike J. Edgar so they would feel comfortable togethe r. J. Edgar Hoover, \"Jerry\" to his friends, must have thought B ob was safe and that he was out of his political ar ena so he could \"let his hair down.\" But it was really a clever set up between Bob and Henry , as they set a trap for Hoover . At the party onset, I was brought in to dance naked and ge t them going. They all dressed up in \"costumes\" lef t out for their \"party enjoyment.\" I presented it that way so they wouldn't feel uncomfortable or inhibited. Then they were given booze, cocaine, anything they wanted . There were party poppers and dishes full of diffe rent recreational drugs with little tags attached explaining the type of ride th ey would go on if they took a certain pill or powde r - everything short of injectables was offered. This group of men got really high and silly and changed into the cos tumes. Once they were high, I worked them for information as pr e-directed by Henry Kissinger. J. Edgar must not ha ve known that Bob Hope was connected to Kissinger. So, the i nformation gathered that evening - not only Hoover and his friends' direct answers to questions, but their attitudes, and sexual preferences, etc. - wer e all recorded directly into my mind files . From then on the Council had \" Hoover by the balls or was it the pussy?\" my controllers joked . From then on the FBI was under Council control and they even got Hoover to put blocks and differe nt rules, regulations, and codes directly into the FBI operations. That began to set up a controlling mechanism for the future so that when the next FBI director took office, things inside the Bureau would be in place so the Council could continue to manipulate them toward their Ultimate year 2000 goal. Alan Cranston Senator Alan Cranston was Bob's right-hand political man in California. He also attended Bob's parties. Alan carried out things Bob wanted done in the governmen t sector. Bob's business dealings ran deep into world governments . He used government agencies as a tool for his ben efit and he \"bought\" people already working in the government so that he could control them and \"get t hings in order,\" he would say. Which meant bend or change laws to his benefit. Cranston was the center of the political wheel, the inside corrupt wheel, in Cali fornia. If anyone"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"wanted anything done, all they had to do was contac t Bob and he would go through his political cronies to get it done-no matter what it was. Senator Cranston was tied into Bob Hope and from wh at I saw, Bob was tied to the outskirts of the Coun cil, but Cranston was not. Politicians were never allowed to be that close or to be directly affiliated with the Council , but were given information, as they needed it from unid entified sources. That is what I was, an unidentifi ed source. Cranston was one of Bob's favorite connections. Cranston li ked \"spankies\" over his lap. He would make me lie over his lap and he would spank me, \"to turn me on, \" he would say. The more turned on he got the more brutal he became. He was into beatings , sometimes with a belt, and tying me down. He was very aggressive, very scary and unpredictable . Alan Cranston was a bony old, evil man. Cranston was not allowed to leave marks on me. Henr y Kissinger saw to that. Henry kept tabs on me duri ng the Nixon and Reagan administrations because he had his interest in using the information that he had care fully instilled in my mind files and did not want me damaged. Cranston and Bob seemed to be close friends. Bob an d others ran a lot of California politics from Palm Springs and made sure they had the people they needed in their \"back pockets\" in order to \"enact change,\" which me ant bending things for their own financial gain. It usually alw ays boiled down to money, but occasionally Bob did things out of vindication for certain people. He always made peop le \"sorry\" if they were not nice to him. He usually got his way ...his power went high. One night on the Queen Mary , in the mid-1970's Cranston tied me tightly to a h eadboard and then got so drunk or drugged up that he could not u ntie me. So he had sex with me standing up, with me still tied and then he passed out on the bed. I had to stay ti ed up like that until the wee hours of the morning when Bob came and found me. My hands and feet were purple/blue fr om the lack of circulation and I was exhausted but quickly \"snapped out of it,\" when Bob told me to. I switche d to being happy, refreshed and bubbly, while Bob a ttempted to get Cranston sobered up. Sometimes at parties, Cranston stayed the next day to pull himself together around Bob's pool. If Dolo res was there, Bob would tell her I was hired as the maid for the day, but when I would sit on his lap, Dolores would just roll her eyes and walk away disgusted. Theirs was not a marr iage made in heaven. The Chief of Police is Compromised There was a small Italian restaurant located on Lau rel Canyon Boulevard in Los Angeles, called Cafe Ga lleria. My brother Rick introduced Craig and I to the unique l ittle restaurant in the early 70's. I remember one evening, as we pulled away from the restaurant after we'd had dinn er, Craig looked back in a quiet, dissociated manne r and said, \"Bad things happen in the back room there.\" When I questioned him further, he didn't answer, so I imme diately tucked it away in the back of my mind and went on t o another subject. But he was absolutely right and years later I had the memory which pieced together the answers to the questions I would have liked to have asked him back then. With the detailed flashback of the event, I had a f uller picture of what really took place that night. I don't know who specifically was behind the blackm ailed event, but I remembered being taken into the back area of the restaurant into a smoke-filled room full of men . I was told to strip and dance, and ended up sitting on Police Chief Darryl Gate's lap in the nude . Cameras flashed pictures of me on his lap after which I was ushered out with my clothes to meet my husband. With only fragments of this memory, I am left with an incomplete pictur e of what my controllers' actual agenda was. You can come to your own conclusions. Pete Wilson California Senator, and then Governor, Pete Wilson was also tied to Bob Hope. Bob manipulated Pete th rough Pete's desire for fame and recognition and through his desire for political gain and for s ex. Bob originally invited Pete Wilson to his parties and used me to lure him into his web so he could gain further control over politics in California, or at least protect some of his interes ts. As Pete discovered, Bob was a direct link to in suring success politically because he had connections to so many p eople and was connected with the Council and the U. S. Defense Department."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" In the beginning I was used with then-California Se nator Pete Wilson on Catalina Island. Pete Wilson was in line to be used by the Council in a big way . Back then they felt he was one of the most promisin g candidates they had for the U.S. Presidency . The last information I had overheard in conversat ion concerning this was that they were not sure he would be ready by the election in 1996, but they had him in a holding pattern for later use wh en the time was right. As Pete went along with what the Council wanted, do ors were to immediately open for him . I was programmed to deliver \"news\" to Pete from the \"higher ups,\" the Council. Over time, he became co nditioned to associating me with. news about his future succe ss. But, who from the outside would have ever suspe cted that 1, initially a young woman and later, a seemingly ordi nary housewife and mother, would be carrying secret information to him from this very elite group that secretly rules the world from the shadows? At that time, the Council sent a message to Pete through me, asking him if he \"wanted to step upstairs ?\" Pete's answer was, \"Yes!\" Lots of the information between Pete and the Counci l was filtered through me. That way, no one knew of his connection, just like they didn't know of Nixon's o r Reagan's direction by the Council. I delivered messages to Pete from the Council on ma ny occasions. He seemed fully conscious of their co nnection to him and their support of him, although I don't know if he was aware of their actual identities. At that time my instructions from the Council were given to me by phone or over closed circuit te levision , where their voices and bodies were scrambled . No one was allowed to know who they were . Pete either didn't know or didn't care how they were able to accomplish what they did in regard to world affairs. Or, maybe he also was programmed and operated with me from a programmed alter state. One night, while 'vacationing' with my family on Ca talina Island, men in suits came and took me from t hem in order to ready me for use with Wilson. It was the same routine as usual trauma, isolation, food and s leep deprivation that occurred before I was used to insure I would later be amnesiac of the entire event. After the traumati c preparation took place, I was escorted by men in suits past the yachtsmen's club out to a dinghy and was taken to Pete on a plush yacht moored in the Avalon Harbor. My control lers dressed me for the occasion in all white - whi te blouse, slacks, gold belt and shoes. It was late at night w hen I was placed on board with Pete. After we were left alone, he wanted to slip over the side of the boat naked and swim in the dark with me. I obeyed. Pete was in good shape physically and had a little more than average share of penile endowment. After our swim, we got into bed and had sex. He pinched my buttocks and told me what a \"great one\" I had. Sometimes he got very aggressive and it traumatized me. On this occasion he nibbled me all over my body, from head to toe-we were both laughing hysterically, I because I was programmed t o be \"congenial.\" He liked to have sex in many diff erent positions and was an active participant, unlike Ron ald Reagan. He seemed to enjoy showing me how physi cally strong he was. When I first met him, he would have two of us (two women) at the same time, but later o n just me, as he said I responded better to him just \"one on one. \" He had massage oils that we used sometimes during sex also. He loved oral sex and liked for me to bring him jus t to the edge of orgasm and then back off so he cou ld last longer. I was programmed to have a lot of \"passion\" with Pe te Wilson. It was normal after sex for us to talk. Usually this was when I delivered the messages I was carrying to him from the Council . We talked a lot in bed as I delivered information to help him climb the political ladder. This particular evening on the yacht, I stayed the night on board with him. He often had very bad breath upon awakeni ng. The next morning, I was taken off the yacht and reunited with my family at our spot on the beach, programmed to think I had never been gone, never missed any t ime with them. As usual, they didn't notice my absence or my return. Pete Wilson knew how to utilize me in the same ways Henry Kissinger did by accessing my mind files . I was used in Sacramento, the State Capital, with him in this way, even before he was Governor of California. But Pete often had trouble remembering the mind file names and wou ld say, \"Now what was that file name again?\" He'd s nap his fingers and go to his desk to get the listing of fi les located in the \"Peter Wilson Library.\" When thi s personalized filing system was gifted to him through me, Henry s aid to tell him, \"Pete, you had a whole library don ated and built just for you.\" It was complete with every volume, e very book housed just precisely where he could gain access to it inside my mind files, all by a simple command. For Pete I was a total sexual robot as well as a comput er robot. But I was never set up to serve both functions at the sam e time. I was flown to meet him in different locati ons, as far back as the early 1980's and met him in Sacramento when he was there on business. Pete had trouble getting my mind files open to access information because he couldn' t wait two hours in between for sex! I overheard He nry ask him,"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"\"Well, did you wait the two hours in between usages ?\" But Pete lied and Henry knew he lied when later he accessed me and asked, \"What time did Peter enter the Wilson Library?\" And I would tell him the exact time and he would catch Pete in a lie every time. Pete didn't seem to know or understand the level of sophistication tha t allowed me to report exactly when Pete initiated sex or mind file use. The Council operated in these very cunning and mani pulative ways with Pete Wilson and others. Slowly t hey introduced people, knowing that over time, trust bu ilt and later when an important event or issue need ed to be dealt with, the connections had been made, a bond was for med and it was easy for them to use people. They ha d plans for Wilson to be Governor of California long before he was elected--so far ahead, in fact, that they start ed putting me with him for the Council to begin \"grooming\" him fo r the job of Governor. Since I had also been used w ith other California Governors, my programmed years of experi ence in regard to the ways the Council worked with politicians was helpful to Pete in his early days. The programmed information I carried included famil iarity with people and agencies, and could help him get acquain ted and adjusted. I was programmed to work with Pete Wilson in regard to the new educational plan for children , that was first implemented in California. That is a whole separate , but very important subject, which I will address in a later chapter. I don't know if Pete was aware of where my information was coming from but he seemed to enjoy large amounts of sex with me in between \"business engagem ents.\" Pete Wilson also had sex with my daughter at one of Bob's parties when she was older. Obviously, my personal experience with Bob Hope is contrary to the \"All- American good citizen\" image that he and the media have managed to fool the majority of the American p eople with all these years . In truth and sorrow, all I have left to say to hi m is, \" Bob , thanks for the memories .\" For now armed with the truth of what has happened, I can be gin to work to stop this once secret, human atrocit y called 'mind control.' \"They struck me,\" you will say, \"but I was not hurt ; they beat me, but I did not feel it. When shall I awake?\" Be not envious of evil men, nor desire to be with them; fo r their minds devise violence, and their lips talk of mischief. “By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding i t is established; by knowledge the rooms are filled up with all precious and pleasant riches. A wise man i s mightier than a strong man, and a man of knowledg e than he who has strength. He who plans to do evil w ill be called a mischief-maker. The devising of fol ly is sin, and the scoffer is an abomination to men.\" -- Proverbs 23-24 Chapter Fourteen Parties at the Rockefellers ...Or, what do the Rockefellers, Kissinger, Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve all have in common ? ...Me as a mind file to organize their plan. Parties were given in New York at the Rockefeller mansion around Christmas time each year. I was flown to Ne w York by commercial airline and was met at the airpo rt and limoed to their home. I was taken by a woman to get my hair and nails done, then brought back and dressed to be used to entertain top people from all over th e world, usually ending in a sexual encounter with individua ls they were targeting . At the parties, I was dressed formally in expensive evening gowns and was often provided a di amond broach or huge diamond necklace to wear for t he evening. There was a whole room, a vault, that had a bank of thin but wide drawers that housed necklaces, broac hes, tiaras, all mounted on special stands shaped to fit them . There were tiered drawers for bracelets, diamond watches and rings. I was taken into the vault at times in o rder for someone to select jewelry that was appropr iate for my outfit. Usually it was a blonde, blue-eyed, soft-sp oken woman who wore her hair up. She was pretty and knew just how to dress me. If I was to target an important of ficial, foreign leader, or king, they put an especi ally alluring piece on me. Then she'd escort me out of the vaulted room down a hall and into the house. It was like a secret hallway that led to \"the collection.\" "},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"One evening she dressed me in a long red strapless formal. It was form-fitting and the bodice was low cut. I had to wear a push up bra to look bustier but she said she loved my small waist. She fastened a diamond neckl ace around my neck and said she liked how it dipped down to ac cent the bodice of my dress. My hair had been done up and she had me wear large diamond drop earrings displaying lots of diamonds that dangled together. After I was finished being dressed with accessories, the lady took me ou t into one of the main rooms - this one was forest green and Prince Philip was there. She reminded me beforehand to curtsy an d bow deeply to him and to stay down and bow my head for awhile - which I did, before this man d ressed in a black tux, complete with cummerbund and shiny black shoes. Rocky came into the room and put his c igar down in an ashtray, bowed to Philip and said, \"I wanted you two to have some time to get acquainted before the other guests arrived.\" Then he went on to expla in to Prince Philip, \"She has been dedicated solely to you for t he evening. Your wants are her desires.\" Philip smi led. Rocky shook Philip's hand with both hands and expla ined, \"It's an honor to have you here this evening and to express our sincerity, this young lady has been ded icated to you for your Highnesses pleasure for the night.\" \"Thank you,\" Philip replied. \"You're most kind.\" They cont inued speaking in formalities. That's how everyone spoke around Philip. Rocky handed him a drink that the butler/bartender had made and excusing himself, said, \"I'll leave yo u two alone for awhile and I'll be back to check on you to see if there's anything you want or need.\" As he walked out of the room, the butler who was on his heels closed the do ors. I was just a teenager, but my inner twin siste r, Sharon, was the personality that was groomed for these assignme nts with the elite. Philip and I sat on the couch a nd I smiled at him and was shy, as programmed. He reached out and took my hand and sipped his drink. He was nervous l ike he wasn't sure how to act or just what to say to me. B ut he began, \"You're very young and very beautiful. \" \"Thank you, your Highness,\" I replied shyly. Prince Philip reac hed out and put his arm around me and I leaned up a nd kissed him. He was younger and more squarely handsome in a homely kind of way than the old men I was used to. \"This is just the beginning of a very wonderful evening,\" I said as I kissed him on the cheek. I knelt down in front of him, placing my carefully manicured hands on his knees a nd looked into his eyes as I started inching my han ds near his crotch. Quickly he said, \"I'd like to enjoy looking at you this evening at the party, knowing you will be my dessert.\" I smiled up at him and nodded yes, then got up and sat back down by his side. He stood and ushered me out to the other room witho ut waiting for Rocky to come back to get us. I thou ght, \"He didn't follow the rules,\" but it didn't seem to mat ter. The beautifully dressed people at the party bo wed to him all night, even the men. I sat off on a couch in a corn er alone for some time and he just kept looking ove r at me and smiling. Since I was under mind control I couldn't think to accurately identify the Royal family struc ture and mistakenly thought to myself, \"I wonder where the p rincess is, or if there is one?\" In addition, I cou ldn't think to question or to know what I was actually involved in . This wasn't a large party and I didn't know or re cognize the others. Philip spoke very formally but didn't act h ow I thought a prince or a king was supposed to act . I had no way of understanding his position in the Royal family, but assumed that since everyone was bowing to him, he must be a king. He just kept looking at me like he was remind ing himself of what was to come. Later, people bega n to leave, and they all took forever saying goodbye. Then some men in suits took us by limo to a hotel there in N ew York - a penthouse suite - and escorted us up to the room. I didn't know who the men were, if they were guards or his own security, but they acted like the Secret Service ag ents did. I had been given a white, full-length coa t to wear. I felt like 'a princess' since I usually wasn't dressed qu ite that formally. Once inside the room, he started to undress out of his formal clothes. \"Please your Highness,\" I offer ed, \"allow me.\" He sat on the bed while I took off my coat and knee led down to take off his shoes, socks (with the ela stic straps), and then I undid his cummerbund and unbuttoned his shirt very slowly and seductively while I kissed hi m gently all over his face. I rubbed his neck and shoulders for awhile and then took off his pants. He wore boxer s horts, the baggy kind. Once he was undressed, he slowly took o ff my clothes, and then pulled back the sheets and laid me in the bed and began kissing me. He was passionate and didn't hurt me. I was sent to sexually service him at other times. As usual, I was always kept in extreme isolation be fore and after I was taken to these parties and was deprived of food and water most of the time until I was deliver ed back to the airplane. I was told things to say t o key people during the parties and continued delivering their i mportant messages after the party, when I had sex w ith an individual they had pre-designated. When my job was finished, I was debriefed and put into isolation a gain before being flown back to my home in California. Nelson R ockefeller continually accessed me by closed circui t television"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"in California, especially before an upcoming event. I was programmed to drive to a local Holiday Inn, go to the front desk for a key, and then directly to room 222 . It was there by closed circuit television that I was instructed what to do and what to say to certain individuals t hat I was soon to be connected to in Los Angeles, s uch as Barbra Streisand and other celebrities or individuals I would be se eing later at his parties. One year Gerald and Betty Ford were there and another year Ronald and Nancy Reagan . There were always lots of celebrities, royalty from England, and leaders f rom countries all over the world. Henry Kissinger took me to a Rockefeller party one year and kept coming back to me during t he evening with instructions about whom to approach and what to say to them. He instructed me to approach Jackie Kennedy Onassis . He told me to tell her how much I respected her and the late president, an d how I admired the way she picked up and went on a fter his assassination. Jackie smiled and displayed shy mann erisms when I first approached her. She said she wa s very happily remarried and her life was running as smoot hly as could be expected. Later she told me she wis hed she could spend more time with Ari but that she underst ood he had lots of business dealings all over the w orld and was a busy man. Aristotle Onassis was not among the guests at the party . Another man escorted Jackie. He was very tall, dark and handsome . Noticing I was talking with her, this man returned by her side and escorted her to another room . He seemed to be very protective of her. Henry tol d me things to tell lots of people so I would be fa miliar to them and more trusted if they ever needed to send m e in on them at a later date. One of the rooms in the Rockefeller house was decor ated in deep forest green with a rich green plaid t hat went half way up the wall. It was a beautiful house, full of beautiful wood and glass. It was decorated, of cour se, to the hilt. The front doors were massive wood and glass, and th e entire estate was monitored by remote access televi sions so someone inside the house could always see what was going on inside and outside on the grounds. Happy Rockefeller wasn't called Happy for nothing. She drank a lot at their parties and later at the end of the evening they usually had to take her away because s he was sloppy drunk. Henry got mad at Nelson about it but Nelson stuck up for her. Henry told Rocky that it l ooked very unprofessional and undignified, and that she should be kept away from the public eye, but Rocky wanted her there anyway. Famous people who attended the Rockefeller parties had their identities protected . They arrived in limousines with tinted windows and in this way were protected from public exposure. The highly sophisticated alarm and monitoring systems that constantly scanned the grou nds provided the security necessary for the VIP's w ho visited. No one was ever to disclose who attended the partie s. On the surface the parties looked like mere soci al gatherings of friends, but they were much more, as secret and sensitive information was passed around a select gr oup. A small group of men always met in a back room after the pa rty to discuss world strategies and business . It was not unusual for guests to spend the night, but only a select fe w were invited to the meeting. At these private meetings, I watched the men who literally ran the world . Men who decided when it was profitable and/or strategically important and timely to start a war . They even had it planned who would begin the fighti ng and where . It always added up to big money, power, and contr ol. At times, I was allowed into the room because they were aware that I was under mind control and my services were utilized in whatever way they needed to use me. People in America think they elect their Presidents , but from what I witnessed , they do not as the process of putting them into office is a highly controlled and corrupt one . The media is so controlled that the American people never get the full and accurate story . The Presidents are selected long before they are 'v oted' into office . It is no accident that Ronald Reagan and Pete Wilson won the governorship of California. It was rigged through financial, business, and political connections from this contr olling group, headed by the Council, right down int o various business and political factions, and then on down i nto the public arena. They own the press . They own key television stations and famous anchorm en . They have key people who own the newspaper companies . They buy magazine companies and own many large corporations that allow them to have leading edge media exposure, thus allowing them to control the information peopl e see on the television news, read in newspapers and magazines, or hear on the radio . They are funded by the richest men and corporatio ns in the world who get what they want, when they want it, by whatever means it takes to do so. They operate above the law, above the federal government . I witnessed and recorded in my photographic memor y many of these encounters as I was bounced around the globe in the company of vari ed and influential \"people in the know.\" "},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Rockefeller Connections Nelson Rockefeller was connected to Bob Hope and many people in positions of power Nixon, Ford, Reagan , and Bush - even before these men were Presidents . At the Rockefeller mansion , there was a direct phone line to the White House that no one was supposed to know about. It was kep t in a side closet behind a mirrored liquor cabinet . Nelson didn't even have to dial; he just picked it up and began talking . I couldn't understand what he was saying, but he often spoke about the Chase Manhattan Bank . There was a clear plastic box on the mouthpiece of this phone . I don't know the purpose for this device. When I was at the mansion, Nelson called Reagan at times. He never told Reagan I was there. My instruc tions were to keep quiet. John D. Rockefeller operated independently from the rest of the Rockefe llers . There was animosity between John D. and the rest . They didn't like or trust him , so they kept secret their operations from him . They also didn't trust his political connections. There was a very ornate, ver y 'old wealth' hotel in New York where I was set up to meet different people. This time they sent me in to \"visit\" John D. Rockefeller . The Council wanted to see if they could \"win him over,\" so they could use him . I was preprogrammed in room 222 at the Holiday Inn in California and then sent to t arget him at that New York hotel. They dressed me i n a small short black dress with black nylons, black heels and I ca rried a small black purse. I knocked at his door an d he answered. He was about 5' 11\" and on the stocky side with gre ying hair, nice face and skin. He had on a grey sui t and white shirt and his tie was undone. He looked like he had been resting. He asked me why I was there, and in a very upset voice, I screamed, \"Someone's been shot!\" He said, \"What!?\" I told him again. Then he pulled me into the room and questioned me more. I said eve rything just like I was programmed to, but he didn't fall for an y of it. He said, \"I don't know who sent you but I'm not interested ,\" and he showed me the door. When I arrived back d ownstairs my contact said, \"You're back so soon?\" We left quickly through the large brass revolving d oor out into the cold, to an awaiting limousine. Supreme Court Justices Nelson Rockefeller was also the connection to some Supreme Court Justi ces who were old friends of his . They called him, \"Old Rocky.\" I was sent in on different Supreme Court Justices and I was instructed to mak e sure neither judge talked about or knew that I was being intimate with the other. The Council knew just the perfect phrases to have me deliver in these situations that would shut the door to these judges ever mentionin g our private, intimate experience to anyone, especially their col leagues. All these judges knew each other well. It was like an inside men's club and so the Council would tell me something no one would have known abo ut judge so-and-so, and I would tell the judge I was with about it and that his colleague, judge so-and-so, was extremely sensitive about this subject . This would cause him to not want to have anything to do with the other judge and so it would be in t hat judge's favor to not ever mention our little affair . For example, they had me say, \"I overheard judge so-and-so talking at a party and he was saying how distastefu l he found it when men his age were dabbling with y ounger women. So to protect your relationship with him, it would probably be better for you if you never ment ioned this evening with us together. Now I can understand perf ectly well, how a man like yourself would desire an d benefit from an evening with a young woman like myself. To be perfectly frank, it's very normal and healthy, b ut certain other old 'stick in the mud' judges just don't see things the same way. I'm sure you understand.\" And if the judge was convinced, then I had him locked into the secret an d if not I would report back and my controllers wou ld give me another tactic to slip in later, after this one had passed. I was trained to read their body and facia l language early on. I was taught not to trust their words as much as th eir body language. There were two very old Superior Court judges who I was sent in to seduce and probe for information. T hese very old men actually believed all the lines I told them about how attractive I found older men, how wise I knew they were and how I really appreciated maturity and expe rience over the younger men of the day. And I got t hem tipsy and then asked them questions very innocently, like I was just curious about a certain subject. They u sually answered me in strictest confidences to help me und erstand how things worked. Sometimes their egos wou ld get so inflated from all the flattering I delivered, that they would be flustered and say more than they prob ably normally"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"should or would have. Even under mind control, it really made me lose my respect for old men - especially Supreme Court Justices , because they had no morals and totally believed and ate up all the lies . The Council sent me into many different areas within the government to \"feel things out.\" I knew that meant to have sex and ask the questions I was directed to ask. They didn't say, \"feel thing s out,\" if I was only to ask questions or give info rmation. Alan Greenspan and The Federal Reserve I was assigned to be with Alan Greenspan . He is currently Chairman of the Federal Reserve B oard and controls the nation's economy by intentionally manipulating the Federal Reserve Banks and the Stock Exchange. Through this manipulation Alan is able to skim off monies for us e within the shadow government . It is similar to money laundering only this is done at the highest levels, channeling huge amounts of monies into, among othe r things, classified, hidden government projects. This agenda is tied into Henry Kissinger and Bob Hope. And is largely directed by the Rockefellers . David in particular was connected to the banking system and financial a spects of the New World Order . George Bush was also connected up very high in this plan . The Stock Exchange was often nothing but a charade , publicly displaying one façade while privately ca rrying on a very separate, private agenda. This agenda is aimed at funding many branches of wh at is to be the new inner structure and workings of the New World Order -- the One World Government. The financial infrast ructure was put in place and further honed beginning in the 60' s and by now it is well-greased and operating at fu ll capacity with the target takeover by the year 2000. By the year 2000 all parties are to be in place, al l subsidiaries are to be up and running optimally with direct funding coming from t he large New World Order funded and controlled corporations of which there are many and which are multi-layered . There is a whole network of men who manipulate a lot of international business around the world, including the World Banking System. Chase Manhattan Bank was just the tip of a whole network of banks all over the world that were set with a framework to control the world economy and hide illegal funds . These illegal funds are never detected if they ar e distributed into the internal workings of this banking system. In the early years, I was programmed to make large deposits into banks all over the world . Many mind-controlled slaves were doing that work. There are programmed people involved in global impl ementation all the way to the top in order to insur e that by this time, through this generation, their plan will not fail. Mind control was and still is their failsafe mechanism intended to alleviate any human weakness or human interferen ce. If the world's computer systems were to shut do wn, their systems, carefully created within the mind file sys tems of mind control victims, would continue to ope rate. Cryptic information passes to people in the know with the \" eyes to see and the ears to hear,\" as I overheard t hem during Stock Exchange dealings cryptically refer to those involved with New World Order agenda. Those program med are able to glean plans and agendas as well as command instruction while watching the stock trades on tele vision or by their actual physical presence while there. When I was sixteen, my future mother-in-law, Sara Ford , got me a job at a stock brokerage firm in Pasaden a, called Independent Securities . Most people my age wouldn't have even been hired but I was \"lucky\" and unlike other new employees, didn't have to start in the ma ilroom. Instead I started work in the securities ex change room. There were cocktail parties attended by men and wom en in expensive clothes. There were more men than w omen and there were times when Mr. Hecht , Sara's boss and president of the company , briefed me on a certain \"fellow \" who I was to be especially nice to and was to \"cate r to,\" in an attempt to sway him to do business with Independent Securities. I was told to act naive, innocent and s weet because some of the \"older gentlemen\" preferre d it that way. So that's what I did. I served drinks at the partie s in order to have a substantial reason to interact with these wealthy gentlemen (potential investors). Parts of me were filled with lots of information on stocks, bonds, annuities, the Federal Reserve and these parts knew exactly how the Federal Reserve manipulated bu siness, corporations, and large investments for the ir own gain. Funds were amassed through the Federal Reserv e for use in anything but what the funds were publi cly portrayed as being used in. By the way, nobody audits the Fed, not even the IRS . I was heavily used for both mind files and sex, but my mind file use during my teens and on into adulthood, always took priority as the Council, Henry, and others sent messages and information bac k and forth to each other without the risk of being publicly linked. For example , Henry would say when an international crisis would/could be created and what countries were to be involved . Then those players involved would get their monie s or exchanges, step up to be in the right position"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"to gain monetarily and then step out. There were lots of corporate men who backed these e ndeavors with money from their corporations . They fronted the money in exchange for favors fro m the Federal Reserve or politicians. Their needs were always researched by the Council t o determine (before they went to the negotiating ta ble) what would entice them most. The corporate owners were o ften targeted from many different positions like se nding in other successful players who had profited considera bly in the past, in order to further influence them to participate. Often at the final time I was sent in (if the corpo rate head was open to sex with a young woman), I wa s preprogrammed with line after line that was designe d to hit them deep to get them to \"our side\" or to cooperate with the business venture. Henry and Alan Greenspan worked hand-in-hand sending endless messages through me to coordinate many of these so-called \"business ventures.\" They uploaded me with information in New York when I was there, u sually for other Kissinger or Rockefeller business, or I was i nstructed via closed circuit television from Califo rnia. I believe this was around 1967-68. 1 wheeled patients and old people to a closed circuit viewing of a church ser vice on Sundays, at the Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital , where I went with my Sunday school teen class - t he same church where there were rituals occasionally. Anywa y, my class wheeled people from their rooms to watc h a church service, via closed circuit television in the hospi tal. When the service was over, my friends went to take these patients for a snack and back to their rooms. I sat alone, my attention glued to the front of the clos e circuit television that sat on top of a metal stand on wheels. I knew from instructions to flip through the channels to 2 2, then pulled up the antenna and watched and listened carefully to i nstructions given. There were times when the man on the screen talked while he pointed with a pointer to figures o n a chalkboard that I was to retain. Percentages, actuaries and places to go, people to meet, and things to say. I photographed with my min d the names, figures, etc., and listened carefully for dialogue I was to repeat to certain individuals like Reagan or Hope, and later Nixon or corporate heads. When it was over, it just cut off and the television went all fuzzy again bu t I was always instructed to change it back to a normal numbered s tation - preferably the one that had been on, so no one would detect. Church activities were used often as a fron t to get me to places where I was supposed to acqui re further information for upcoming events. Then the occasional rituals or traumas at church we re performed to keep all this information hidden . Reagan was governor during this time and I was gi ven information over the closed circuit television to deliver to him. Later on, I delivered the information to him at places like the Motion P icture Hospital, where my mom worked. The Rockefellers, especially Rocky, used me often d uring this time, but not without going to Henry fir st. Henry was still always in charge of me, but let Rockefeller u se me to further his own interests. Henry would ask for \"updates\" on all of these other people's uses of me so he kne w what was going on in lots of different circles at once. And, he would use any confidential information he found to further his own interests in business or government dealings. He found out the 'dirt' on others by debriefing me fro m my use with the Rockefellers or different corpora te heads, then he or Bob would take advantage of the information t o further their interests . He already had free access to the Federal Reserve information through Alan Greenspan and others, but he could tap into mind file data an ytime he wanted or needed. After high school I took bookkeep ing classes at the local junior college, alongside my psychology major. At the base of some of my banking mind files was my bookkeeping coursework at Pierce College to which Henry then attached a framework fo r his use adding lots of data from classified docum ents, videos, etc. It was a very sophisticated system tha t worked on the inside of my mind while I was doing another job and then the completed reports were ready when Henr y needed them. Henry sometimes gave those internal systems a day or week to come up with the final data. He of ten said this was the \"brain of the future,\" making the need for computers obsolete. Henry said that, in the future, man would explore \"inner space.\" The Council was the glue that held the major corporations toget her at the very top , the large international corporations. The Council was above Henry Kissinger , their international political mastermind and Alan Greenspan who used the Fed to gain the money to fund and furt her their plan - to cement and make uniform the wor ld economy for more efficient organization and ease of control ling. Alan Greenspan had a lot of big business backing, t hus furthering their banking deals. They laundered huge sums of money through subsidiary treasury banks so the acti on would be taking place off to the side in unnamed , unmonitored banks . That way the main Federal Reserve Banks, were kep t freer to operate without detection. The plan covered the overall banking system so nothing could be traced. So if there were large sums of mon ey that needed to be washed, they were put through the smal ler, subsidiary banks that weren't being monitored, so no one"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"would know. Sometimes these subsidiary banks ended up actually handling much larger sums of money and transactions than the larger Federal Reserve Bank i n the same geographic area in order to hide the mon ey laundering schemes. The way the system is set up, a ll monies from an area are supposed to funnel throu gh the Federal Reserve Bank in that area in order to monit or many different things, so they can keep control of the money in specific geographic areas. With the large, washe d funds filtering through the subsidiary banks, the laundering system did well and was never detected through the main Fed, which is highly monitored by Congress. Ot herwise the Reserve would come up out of balance every step of the way, since so much money was laundered in c ertain areas and there was no way to begin to explain the large percentage of imbalance there would have been between even neighboring cities' or state's holdings. The F ederal Reserve had areas like political districts. In some areas, it was essential to have the subsidiary banks 'in plac e' in order to funnel the funds from covert operati ons. San Diego was one. Los Angeles was another and Holl ywood was also. Wherever clusters of worker bees (m ind control operatives) were located, money went into a subsidiary bank of the Federal Reserve to keep the funds continually channeling back to them. This was true in areas of immense illegal profit, like in Vegas, where the whole town was built on graft and everyone inside k new who got paid first so no one got hurt or steppe d on. I was constantly traveling to meet with members who were tied into the subsidiary Federal Reserve Banks. Pet e Wilson, who at that time was a San Diego based Senator from California, was one. These individuals tapped into my mind files for the Federal Reserve information and input banking info rmation - everything from profit/loss standpoints to new acco unt numbers in subsidiary banks that worker bees co uld be given to use to launder covert monies. Then, I reported i t all back to Henry and I even had internal compute r analyzers, bookkeepers, data compilers, statisticians, etc., t hat Henry created inside my mind file system so all the data/input that was delivered to me could be instantly filed, computed and readied for delivery to Henry. I also had a system to maintain the original information from individuals, so Henry could double-check my figures. He ran cro ss-checks, periodically setting me down and accessing informat ion while he ran tabs on his calculator. This wasn' t his job, it was Greenspan's, but Henry always double-checked and cross-checked everything to keep everyone honest and to make sure my systems were properly gathering and co mpiling, then computing, the information . It was as if I had a whole set of financial workers inside my head that were specially trained to handle all of this, like a computer program. I believe lots of the corporate heads that reported their earnings to me were not aware I was a robot. I even had to write down numbers for some of them, just fo r show, when they got overly concerned that I would n't be able to remember all they had reported to me. So, that o bservation leads me to believe that they weren't al l aware of the mind control enhancements I had in place, guarantee ing I would perform to perfection. Kissinger and Nelson Rockefeller's Plan One day, Nelson Rockefeller was leaning over me in the back of the limo talkin g to Henry as if I didn't exist. They were talking about the advanced research projects o n brain studies and they spoke as if they were the only intellectual elite capable of understanding the adv anced technology , as compared to the \"peons\" as they called the uninitiated . They spoke of their elite dream of ridding the worl d of the non-thinking, the genetically inferior, the deficient people of the world , so they could have sole heir and control over the e arth for advanced purposes . They spoke over me, leaning on me and using me as a table or having me hold their drinks, or Henry's cigar, while they conversed about erudite and diver se scientific topics. There were times when Henry and Rocky planned lots of strategies between the ride in the car from New York to Washington, DC. Henry had a different type of smell – a European aroma and his suits always smelled of him and his cigars. He smoked cigars the whole entire way, at times they were Cuban. Often he blew the smoke r ight in my face and it was hard to breathe. Sometimes I couldn 't tell what world I was in, the real world or the one \"over the rainbow.\" It got extremely confusing at times but H enry told me to rely on those around me to help me know where I was. I was told, \"like a pretty ballerina led thr ough the dance steps by the perfect lead man, your partner is always a reliable mirror for you to see yourself in.\" New York and Washington, DC were my home away from home , but Henry made me keep my eyes closed often while we we re in transit and frequently asked me, \"Where do yo u think you are?\" I would try to answer, guessing our locat ion and he would intentionally attempt to scramble my reality by telling me, \"No, you're now in San Francisco,\" or s ome other place we weren't really. In front of me, Henry would tell Rockefeller that we were in Pennsylvania, when we were actually on Pennsylvania Avenue at the Whi te House. "},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Henry and Rocky often placed me between them in the back seat. The glass partition was closed, shuttin g out the driver, creating the privacy they needed for their strategic planning. There was a television and a ba r inside but they didn't drink alcohol, as they were very intent on w hat they were planning. Rocky often got all excited in regard to an agenda and he would tell Henry , \" Put this message in for her to deliver to Nixon ,\" or whomever the plan was for . Henry placed the needle in between my knuckles and if I bled, he pulled out one of his fancy handkerch iefs to wipe it off. One time he joked to Rocky, \"My wife wonder s where all the kerchiefs she buys me are.\" He laug hed and said he had to throw a lot of them away because he couldn't explain the blood spots. It was better for both of us when he was able to replace the needle with touch p rograms. Rocky always agreed with Henry but Henry didn't always agree with Rocky . So in his coarse, froggy voice Rocky would say, \" Okay, advise me.\" Then Henry would tell him how to correct the plan. Henry was always right with the people he was with. One day they tal ked about Happy , and Rocky said he was worried about her drinking. He told Henry he didn't know what to do. Henry said, \"You need to get her into a program.\" Henry's Love for His Friend Rocky Henry and Rocky got along extremely well. Henry genuinely laughed when he was with Rockefeller . He seemed to love to be with him. Henry really wanted him to be president and said that then they could have really been a team. Henry said it was fruitless, that Rockefeller would only lose anyway and it wasn't worth risking the w hole party's success by running someone who couldn't win. Henry said Rockefeller didn't have enough popular followi ng, despite his name, and that people would hold his we alth against him, since he was already publicly kno wn to be rich. Henry thought it was really smart of Bob to c loak his wealth for as long as he was able to. He explained that most people didn't like their leaders to be rich , he said, \"well off would pass, but not rich.\" Henry's first thought usually was \" How will the masses react to this ?\" What will their attitudes and impressions be ?\" He decided what they needed to think and then he went about structuring his eventual desired outcom e. \"May take awhile, but we've got time. We'll just wo rk on them until we get them the way that we want them. Then they will be happy and we will be happy because we made them that way.\" San Francisco I was only a teenager, and was in San Francisco wit h my mom and dad and Craig. I was taken from my fam ily and men in suits escorted me through metal gates, almos t like a prison, into a big building with cement fl oors. They took me into a noisy room where a machine was printing s heets of money. There was lots of money! A man who worked there said, \"The boss says to inflate it. There's a munitions deal comin' down and we don't want the F ed (reserve) to show a surplus in this area.\" One of the men holdin g my arm said, \"Okay,\" and stepped aside. I deliver ed the message, \"The dock at 5,\" and was immediately escor ted back out. They took me down a hall and out past a turnstile into a black sedan and put me in the back seat, pushed my head down and we drove away. There were lots of arms and drug shipments in San F rancisco and they raised and lowered the amount of money in the Federal Reserve to hide the activity in the are a. They had to inflate it when there was no drug or munitions activity, so when there was, it would be even and s teady and won't show the influx of the money into t he area. I was taken to many large buildings, with high fences and guards. On another one of our so-called trips to Frisco, I was taken from the St. Francis Hotel where I was si tting in the restaurant with my parents and Craig. When the men in suits arrived to get me, I had on a yellow dress and went into the bathroom and removed from my large leather purse, a carefully folded, white form-fitting slee veless shift that my mom had made for me. I had never worn it be fore. After I changed and put on a small white-veil ed pill box hat and fixed my hair, which had been professionall y teased and ratted into a flip, I went out from th e bathroom where a suited man took my arm and led me out a bac k entrance of the hotel. It was cold and foggy, and I had short sleeves and no jacket. I didn't know where Craig or my parents had gone. The man in the suit took me o ut to a black car and put me inside and told the driver, \"Deliver the young lady downtown, like we discussed.\" I jus t sat in the back seat and the driver rolled up the window betwe en the seats. Another man stopped the car on the do cks and came around, got me out, and replaced my little whi te hat with a wide brimmed one and told me to go do wn to a"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"ship, and pointed his finger in its direction. I wa lked down there and it was still very cold. I stood by a big ship until a man brought me aboard. Then I waited in a room, i n \"park mode\" until a man came up to me and said, \" I'm Fred.\" I replied, \"Pier 69,\" and he pushed me away. I walk ed back to the dock where the driver was waiting an d he waved me back into the car and took me back to the hotel. I changed back into my yellow dress and went back to meet my mom and dad and Craig in the restaurant. I never go t to eat what I ordered. I returned to San Francisco many times over the yea rs, for different assignments, some including the U nited States Mint. Henry said there were some jobs that just had to be taken care of from the inside, so he sent me there, often in conjunction with an agenda from Alan Greenspan. One time, I was heavily disguised as a male and armed with false security badges. At other times, another slave acco mpanied me and we were both disguised as males. In the early years of the late 60's before Craig and I were marr ied and then in the early 70's after we were marrie d, we often drove up the California coast to Lake Naciamento wi th friends or family to waterski during the summer. Craig and I often took side trips where he would take me to San Francisco for the day or to other places in the Ca lifornia Redwoods, where there would be private meetings hel d and Henry needed me there for mind file usage. Lee Iacocca I delivered many names of banks and available subsi diary bank account numbers to many corporate owners , including Lee Iacocca . They continually changed the accounts so they could n't be traced and sent me all over to sleep with and/or deliver account numbers to corpor ate heads all over the nation. I was even flown fro m place to place on corporate Lear jets in order to deliver ac count numbers comfortably and in an entertaining ma nner, with security features included, to corporate heads. Lee had monopolies with other big corporations, int ernational ones, and he also owned parts of major u tility companies. I heard him talk on his personal phone o ften. It was a big deal back in those days for a man to h ave a portable phone , and he had one he wore under his jacket. I travel ed the skies with Lee Iacocca , doing whatever he needed in his private jet. There was lots of room i nside, but it wasn't a fancy one at first. I polish ed his shoes, gave him oral sex, whatever he wanted. I performed oral sex on Lee Iacocca on his Learjet before giving him the number for the new accounts he needed to use, plus some ot her information from Henry. I was instructed to off er, \"Can I take your glasses, Mr. Iacocca?\" And after he was s atisfied, I was to smile and say, \"I hope you were pleased.\" Lee insisted on these information transfers happeni ng in the private confines of his jet for security and I had to wear disguises to board and deboard the jet. I just look ed like a maid or at other times a secretary. Never the same disguises, and for Mr. Iacocca I had to even wear s ome of the tooth disguises while getting on and off the plane. He always had me remove them once we were airborne and then I removed my clothing disguises in exchange f or something more comfortable and appropriate for trav eling. Lee Iacocca wore a tie block with a gold cha in on it. I sat next to him, put my head on his shoulder and pl ayed with his chain before I unzipped his pants and performed oral sex. He was kind enough to hand me a handkerch ief to wipe my face afterwards and then he took a q uick nap. He said it always cleared his mind to take a quick nap but not a long one because that type made him f eel thick- headed. I usually accompanied him on a business tri p he already had planned. There were other stops af ter him and I seldom flew back with him, but instead connected with another flight or different people that Henry wanted me to see. If I began to remember the Lee Iacocca information, I was programmed to jump off tall bui ldings . \"You will have the compulsion to jump,\" they said to me at UC LA, after I'd been drugged and was lying on an exam table listening to my instructions via earphones. Drug Operations New York City was a major area of operation and I was taken there often to make drug connections for Nelson Rockefeller and the CIA . I think Rockefeller was manipulated by the CIA. I think they may have blackmailed him for things that they knew about him. I don't know f or sure. In New York, the Times Square Clock Tower was the site of many drug deals with Rockefeller and the CI A working together. On one deal my programming and information was as follows: \"Meet me in Times Squar e. You will be known by your fruits. Go to the frui t stand and buy (always different combinations of fruit) an app le, two pears, a banana and two oranges, then walk over and sit on the bench and set your fruit out next to you on the bench so it can be seen. Give the man who sits down and eats the apple the message. Only give the message if he eats the apple. Give no one else the message.\" Once the man"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"arrived and ate the apple, the message was to tell the man where to pick up the dr ugs . It was dangerous business and they stationed three men on rooftops who were armed with high-powered rifles to protect and watch over the drug deal. They said that I was too important an asset t o risk losing. Years before, I had been programmed to say to anyone who attempted to access me without permissio n, \"Hi, stupid. Men who don't value their life mess wi th me when my owner is not around. But it's the las t time they ever do.\" Opium, heroin, and cocaine sales went down. All I h ad to do was to tell them where it was located. The re were also drug deals locally in California. These took place over the years at Disneyland, Busch Gardens, Knott' s Berry Farm, World Fairs and other public places. These transact ions occurred when I was with other people, like my family or friends, who took me to the location under the guis e of 'a day of entertainment.' I was instructed to deliver information to a man who made himself known to me. My controllers told me what type of clothing the ma n would be wearing and what color hat. When I saw the targe t that matched the physical description that I was preprogrammed to look for, I excused myself from my friends and family, telling them I had to go to th e bathroom. When the target made contact with me, I would ask h im a question, like, if he wanted a 'Twinkie.' If h e said yes, then I'd deliver the message to him. There was alwa ys a precise word combination he would have to say back to me in response to my question. Then and only then woul d or could I robotically deliver the message. There were numerous drug and/or munitions transacti ons that I was used to facilitate that took place a ll over the world in conjunction with other outings I was taken on. Reagan was in New York often. It was called a \"Double Whammy\" when I would sleep with and deliver a messa ge to Reagan, and then deliver the message back to the Council. I usually had sex with Reagan after the dr ug deals. I don't think he knew about them. It was a separate deal. But, they combined the two jobs for me into one tim e frame, for efficiency. Mondavi Winery Robert Mondavi had a Lear jet. Craig took me to the Mondavi Celle rs in Napa Valley, California in the wine country. There was a man to whom I was programmed t o give numbers of accounts that Alan Greenspan had set up for him to launder certain monies through. I never spent the night with Craig during that trip through the wine country, though it was supposed to be our time away together, for just the two of us. All I consciousl y remembered until later was stopping at winery after winery, ye t I usually didn't taste the wine. I slept with Mr. Mondavi; he always wore a suit or very nice casual clothes. He was \"dapper,\" as Bob would say. Big Sur, California When Craig and I went to Big Sur for weekends away, we often went to a beautiful restaurant called Nap enthe. It was located on a crag overlooking the ocean and at night it took on a magical glow, cast by the many t iny candles lit all over the restaurant. Craig got us a nice table and we sat down and then a switch would occur. When he got up to go to the bathroom, another man came and sat down n ext to me in Craig's place. I ended up having sex a nd delivering a message to this man. There were many s uch occasions where Craig \"moved over\" and changed places with governors, or presidents, or entertainers - wh omever my controllers needed me to be with. \"For there is nothing covered up, that will not be revealed; or hidden that shall not be known. Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness sha ll be heard in the light; and that which ye have whispered in private rooms s hall be proclaimed upon the housetops.\" -- Luke 12: 2-3 Chapter Fifteen Hope and Kissinger Utilize the Kennedy Family "},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"I remember being taken to a place where a huge gree n lawn defined by a white fence traveled as far as the eye could see. From what I understood, this was the home of the Kennedy family for generat ions . Joseph and Rose, the older Kennedys lived there. There was a big two-story whi te house that had a porch on the outside and a big circular driveway in front. This is where the Kennedy family met for family gatherings and annual reunions. Joe and Rose invited the entire family. I was there, dressed as a maid for the day, in a black dress and little whi te apron. It was my job to deliver the \"goodies\" on a silver platter. B ut there were lots of maids on hand for these types of occasions so when I slipped off with one of the Kennedy men, I w asn't missed. I usually started off serving hors d' oeuvres, but when a Kennedy man approached me and gave me the ey e, I was instructed to continue holding my tray, so it still looked like I was working as we walked into the hou se. Then we would go to a back bathroom or bedroom for sex. Later, I would reappear, carrying my tray of food. Then I would mingle and usually would be approached again, so the whole routine started all over again and I woul d sexually service another of the Kennedy men. I got started \"maidtressing,\" as Bob jokingly calle d it, at their parties when I was a young preteen, \"going on twenty- five,\" when I went there the first time. The younger men in the family selected me but it di dn't take long for the word to get around and the older men wanted a try . I looked older than twelve. The programmed personality for these parties felt t hat JFK taught me a lot. He played with me in a tea sing, fun- loving way, so different than Ted who was so violen t. After dinner JFK often went into the family tele vision room. He sat on the couch, put his feet up on the coffee table and leaned back to watch television. He liked to have a short after dinner drink. He didn't care if he was watching alone, he laughed and laughed at the shows he watched. He was an unusually cheerful man most of the time . When JFK was assassinated, they told me before they did it , and after they had killed him they said to me, \"He is the President and we can make him live or ma ke him die and no one would ever miss you should yo u step out of line. Then we would have to take care o f you, like your little boyfriend JFK.\" It was sad the year JFK died. Everyone wore black a nd Rose, sitting in her wheelchair, kept crying. It was a very sad affair. I think the sex was down that year beca use evidently some of the men were genuinely grievi ng. Jackie cried a lot at family parties after he died . She had a hard time adjusting at first but the Ke nnedy family stood by her and helped her. She sat with the ladies and cried, and they listened and supported her. Ted Kennedy was brutal . He was one of the most violent and meanest men I wa s with . He liked to have sex with me anywhere and everywhere he could, but he especia lly liked to have sex in cold climates in rooms wit h a fireplace. One place had a big rock fireplace and h e made a big fire and then wanted to have sex all n ight. When he neared orgasm he would slap and beat me . He hit me so hard it felt like my head would expl ode. Then in his proper Kennedy accent, he would call me a \"c--t.\" He liked to tie my arms over my head to the headboard or if there wasn't anything to attach my hands and wrists to, he would tie them tightly together. Lots of times he made m e stay tied up for a long time. He liked to hand cuff me also. He was really into bondage and if I ever nea red any sexual pleasure he would start hitting and slapping me, and once that began it was like he couldn't stop himsel f and quickly escalated into extreme violence . He seemed to require that in order to orgasm. I was flown to him in the New England States. At du sk, we walked outside together in a forest. There w as a real chill in the air. He told me to strip and I was forced to take my clothes off outside in the cold . He ordered me to dance around the forest like I was a fairy. Then he laughed like he was drunk or out of his mind. He h ad a rifle with him and he shot it into the air and it really scare d me. He said he shot the gun just so my nipples wo uld stand up. There were other times after he finished violently satisfying himself with me that he would break down and cry. He was very disturbed . But the hurting he delivered never stopped . He used me often until I was just over twenty-fiv e. Bob offered my services to the Kennedys any time th ey wished. He said they could count on my yearly se rvice at their family get-togethers. Bob told them, \"It's so nice to get good help and it's so wonderful when t hey are versatile!\" Then he laughed and pointed to me. So I was sent in year after year. Over time, I had to have sex with all of the Kennedy men, including little John . He wasn't very old when they first brought him to me. Probably about twelve . They believe in training their males at an early ag e by expert women so that they will continue the Ken nedy power that they felt was derived from sex. In their eyes to have sex was to be powerful . "},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Rose seemed to be a matriarch . From what I saw, she ran the family . She seemed to influence Joseph's decisions in business and would make it known when the family sa t down to eat, usually at very long tables. She gav e an update on their lives and then went on to give information on family business investments, trade, etc. Some r elatives took notes and must have gone right home and followed th rough on Rose's suggestions. After she finished she would smile and look around at her family with such love. Then she sat down. Rose had a very commanding pres ence about her. She had more dignity than I witnessed in the Royal family in England . She just demanded respect and she got it. They seemed to treat her very carefully, not ever w anting to offend her . They had very formal, picture perfect dining tables and dinners, complete with a huge sta ff of waiters and waitresses. I hardly ever had to work as a waitress because usually one of the men would get a 'headache' or have to 'go to the bathroom' before, during, or after dinner. Instead, I was more often in a side b edroom wearing a skimpy french maid's uniform and s exually satisfying one the of the Kennedy men. I was never instructed to do two at once, though - they politel y took turns. As far as I know, Rose never discovered their secre t game. Bob continually offered the Kennedy family clan my services, for free, and kept sending me there. So t he Kennedys and Bob always had a good thing going, always scrat ching each other's back. Bob played golf with one o r more of them and took me along to caddy, when they visited him in the Springs. There were times when three oth er sex slaves and I would have sex with one of them. The K ennedy men can't have too many women. I don't think all of the Kennedys golfed. Ted came along even if he didn 't golf. He would get a room on the golf course and perform violent sex on me. Afterwards he would drag me back to Bob, who would be in the middle of his game and Bob would absentmindedly tell him to leave me with him. Bob was so focused on his game he didn't notice if I had blood on my face or body, or if I was a wreck, and I would have to follow Bob on the green and do what ever he asked until we left the golf course. Then he would want me to get down on my knees and give him oral s ex in the back of the limo. The Kennedys usually had their ow n means of transportation and drove separately. It seemed like it must have been in the family will that they had to drive in their own limos, with their own drivers . But Bob took advantage of us being alone in his limo; he never m issed the chance for sex. My daughter Kelly was prostituted to the younger Ke nnedy men . They had a lot of boys. The Kennedy boys were taught early how to 'handle' their women . And I was there to teach them about sex and they were learning how to handle a slave . They knew they could have anything they wished fr om me, and that I was totally subservient. They weren't old enough to be trusted with the full mind -control information. They had to be initiated firs t into the family secrets. Kelly and I sometimes worked together at t he Kennedy's. Sometimes Ted liked to have the \"moth er daughter sex team\" that our controllers programmed us to be. Ted always violently hurt us both. He had a son, who liked to pick Kelly for sex. He took her off by the hand when she was still a little girl, and he was much older. All the Kennedy brothers - JFK, Ted, and Robert - h ad sons, and there were a lot of other elite famili es who carried the same sexual beliefs in regard to their men. And Bob gave me to lots of them, as he arranged for th em to have me inconspicuously at their parties as a \"maidtress.\" I overheard Rose talk about the fact that some of the Kennedy money was tied directly into NASA \"subprojects\" they funded and somehow there was a huge profit fro m it . That's why there's the Kennedy Space Center . NASA is much more than it seems. Research has included \"inn er space stations,\" which was the term I heard used at times in relation to the mind. The Kennedys always wanted to be on the leading edge of technology. \"First is be st,\" they said. Rose was a shrewd businesswoman. She delivere d the facts while Joe sat beside her. It definitely looked like she wore the pants in the family. I never did have sex with Joe. He was elderly and mostly sat around and talked. I think he knew about me , though. I could tell by the look in his eyes that he someho w understood , but I believe that his sons kept the truth from him about my being und er total mind control. I overheard Ted say to one o f his brothers that, \"he wouldn't be able to understand the techno logy.\" This leads me to believe that Joe was unawar e of the mind control technology. The wives and women in the Kennedy clan seemed obli vious of what was going on. Once they got together and began talking they didn't seem to notice where thei r husbands, sons, boyfriends, etc. were. The men se nt me in to serve them tea when they were all together so the w omen would see me being busy. But I usually had sex with many of their husbands, sometimes more than once, b efore the party was over. I served the women tea an inordinate amount of times so they wouldn't suspect that I was doing anything else. They even brought in other pe ople's sons who were not relatives, but they were somehow conne cted to the family - maybe through distant marriage or something. They switched me, gave me instructions a nd then gave me their son. They wanted all these yo ung men"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"to carry on in the Kennedy tradition. If they were not actually close family relatives they would say they wanted them to lend their support always to the Kennedy fa mily. It seemed like a one for all and all for one type situation. Rose approved of Jackie. She thought Jackie was the greatest and spoke to her often at family gatherin gs. Joan Kennedy was always jealous of everyone , especially her sisters-in-law. She often drank un til she got drunk and obnoxious. \"An embarrassment to the family,\" is wha t they always said. And Ted treated her awfully. As Joe got older, he was confined to a wheel chair. The last t ime I saw him he was tied into his wheelchair and h ad some sort of IV or oxygen unit with him. Then he died and was n't there the next time I went. I knew because I wa s updated, by closed circuit television (room 222), what the f amily news was so I could have appropriate conversa tions with the Kennedys. They are connected to the Council and represent them heavily . Joseph Kennedy was big in business and had holdings that were well connected . What I overheard was that when their money was connected, it was protected and the reby guaranteed a place in the power structure. But the money, the big money, had to come before a person was acce pted. The theory was that if a person could amass money t hen it proved they were smart enough, and if they knew how to get it 'connected' then they were pliable en ough, and if they followed through on what was asked of them the y could become RICH and FAMOUS . Then all that was left to do was to create a media public identity to portray whatever image they wanted projected by the media industries they funded. It was all a big cycle where one fed i nto another and they all ended up on top. Bob knew the protocol with the Kennedy family . He was always kind and gracious and giving, and h is nasty jokes about the elite were watered down whenever it came to any of the Kennedys because he didn't ever want to be in disfavor with them . Bob also sent me to different vacation spots arou nd the world, to entertain certain members of the Kennedy family. He never minded paying what he called, \"Big bucks,\" to fly me to someone who could make a difference. Then he would say, \"Ah, yes!\" and get t hat little sly smile on his face. He knew that the connections into powerful leaders and influential people would pay o ff very handsomely. So he didn't mind paying to fly me, and later, me and \"my little filly,\" as he called Kelly , all over the world, sometimes on the Concorde. \"So I declare to you, brothers, that flesh and bloo d cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does their perishable inherit the imperishable. Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed - in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the las t trumpet.\" -- 1 Corinthians 16 Chapter Sixteen Viva Las Vegas The Council targeted and used areas like Las Vegas and Tahoe that drew large crowds. They also were aware that when people were drinking alcohol and watching a sh ow , their subconscious minds were even more open to tak ing in deeply what they were viewing . They knew all about harmonics and they used people who were big stars to deliver their messages . There were times when they didn't have their prog rammed entertainers in place at shows, so they didn't have an inside connection to the show t alent in order to direct them to deliver their mess ages to the crowd. If this occurred they would send someone to attend the show. Preferably before the show or at i ntermission, this person would request of the master of ceremoni es to ask this entertainer to say some specific wor ds in a certain order, explaining that it would mean so much to a c ertain special person in the audience, and then the y would slip the M.C. a large sum of money. Later on, the celebr ity performing the show would deliver the preplanne d words that were meant to have an \"intended programmed eff ect\" on certain programmed mind-controlled slaves i n the audience. If the performer was under mind control h e or she would have been preprogrammed to deliver t he activating messages during the performance. Metro Goldwyn Meyer (MGM) Grand was synonymous with the Mob and the Hollywood celeb rity connection in Vegas . The hotels were small complex microcosms of an othe rwise corrupt group of mobsters owning their share of 'the strip .' The hotels were a way of sorting their interests ."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" Bob Hope had ties to the MGM Grand and directly to the Mob that owned and ran it . I was used there with many mobsters; wealthy men who were sometimes ruthless b ut many times seemed to have large emotions and loy alties to certain causes. Vegas held a lot of memories for me in the late 60's and early 70's, during the pea k of my use with Hope, Nixon, Reagan, Kissinger and others. To insur e their secrecy, I was taken to Vegas for \"recondit ioning\" every so often. These times included trauma to keep the e xperiences sequestered from my conscious mind. Afte r my children were born, they tied the memory of the tra uma to threats used to remind me of the safety or l ack of it for my children in order to keep their secrets really s afe. These mob guys (Sicilian mostly) had lots of m oney and power in their own respective territory. That was a s far as their power went, so they created a networ k amongst each other to insure their power in many places. They fo rmed links to government 'political' figures in an effort to insure that they didn't lose their precious 'holdings' in areas that counted. Drugs, porn, baby sales, prostitution--they made their money wherever they could in order to keep th eir holdings . After I sexually serviced Bob Hope in Vegas, I woul d often be visited by one of his mob buddies who wo uld \"give me the treatment.\" That meant drug me, isolate me, and rape me whatever trauma it took to keep my prog ramming intact for use with Bob, the \"Prez\" and others. The y were brutal, and knew just how to terrorize me bu t not physically damage me too much just inflict a lot of pain. The Mob was very connected to Bob and variou s government operations, and had their own pecking or der that needed to be followed to insure that a per son stayed alive. The Council was above the Mob, above the gov ernment, and literally coordinated how things went down with the Mob; and ultimately was instrumental in taking away much of their power and then redistributing it as needed. During the trauma the mobsters sometimes called me \"deafling,\" and told me the walls in Vegas had eyes and ears and could watch and hear me at all times, and that there were powerful men there who could see me all the time. Frank Sinatra Bob gave me to \"Uncle Frankie\" one night after Fran k Sinatra did a show in Vegas. Frank liked to use whips and chains and those very scary leather straps with me . He liked to orgasm while I was lying there on my back with him on top, while he continually tightened the leather strap around my neck until I was nearly dead - at t hat point he could orgasm. I had sex with him often and did the things he told me to do. One time he told me to go over to the man wearing the diamond stickpin and give him a mes sage, \"I love you...\" I wasn't able to retrieve all of this memory because it turned into carousel rides, whirl ing, spinning, like a top, so I couldn't think to r emember. This programming is called spin programming and is intended to disorient and confuse. The whir ling feeling I felt in my brain was often combined with hearing a popular song playing in my head, as the lyrics reminded me, \"I'm so dizzy my head is spinning.\" The whole Las Vegas scene was always an extremely p ainful nightmare for me. I was subjected to lots of violence there from Frank Sinatra , \"to keep all the little secrets quiet,\" he said. He was brutal to me. He tied me up, down, tied my wrists together, slapped me over and over, used bright lights, raped me and strapped me with a leather belt. Vegas was never fun. Porn was also filmed there and I was prostituted to high government officials and friends of Bob. Uncle Frank took care of the \"security\" so I d idn't ever step out of line. The consequences were disastrous every time I stepped out of line. There was a numbe r system that measured things I did wrong - if I di sobeyed in any way, I was marked down a certain number of poin ts. Only I didn't ever know what the number system was or how it worked. So I never knew if I'd reached the p oint where I had to be \"taken care of.\" It was very scary and I was always confused and couldn't think because I di dn't know, couldn't remember, what it was that was bad to do. So I was afraid everything I was doing could cause some point to be added or taken away. They kept sco re for years and the stakes went up after I had the kids. Then t hey threatened to hurt them or when the kids were o lder they put me in front of all three of my children, and got ve ry close to killing me, in order to traumatize all of us, so we wouldn't remember. In later years my little daughte r, Kelly was often prostituted to many famous and s exually perverted men, including pedophiles like George Bus h, Mickey Rooney and others. Uncle Frank was younger than Bob, and Bob said Fran k could run faster to catch me if the need ever aro se. Uncle Frank was the single worst heavy with me - except for Ted Kennedy, Francois Mitterand , and my own father . Frank was very scary and I reported to him directly in Vegas. I met with him upstairs and listened and followed his every direction. I went into a hypnotic trance and listened carefully, and then he would snap his fing ers to switch me"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"into another personality, and later on I would do e verything as he commanded. \"Uncle Frank\" told me wh o to sit by at the baccarat, black jack or crap tables. He told me what to say to certain men, where and how to ha ve sex with them and gave me a key to the rooms to take them to . These men had two hours of sheer luxury and sex, an d sometimes it ended with me soaping them down and re dressing them . Sex, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, whatever they wanted for added pleasure. Whips and chains and leather straps, that Uncle Frank often u sed to nearly strangle me, were provided to these men. Frank was very private about his private life - to the point of violence if anyone ever asked him anyt hing. Bob had to remind Frank that I was of small stature and tol d him he didn't want him to \"break anything\" on me. Frank could get very carried away. Once, he grabbed my hair and kept pushing my head into a full tub of water unti l I couldn't breathe and was gagging, choking and grasping for a ir. Uncle Frank was the one who made me really sick in Vegas. He nearly killed me and knew all kinds of ways to t orture a person . I saw him break a guy's arm on the corner of a desk, very easily, like it was a pretzel . The guy fainted. He loved to do stuff like that t o people. But I did the men Uncle Frank told me to, and did the best job I poss ibly could, or there would be retaliation. If I did n't perform to their standards I got hurt very badly. Uncle Frank would throw me up against walls and when my body hit, I felt like I was broken. \"Body slams,\" he called them, an d I got a lot of those. He nearly killed me after I was with some dark skinned, foreign leader dressed in a white rob e with a white turban on. This man was brutal also . Frank shaved my pubic hair for this man . That was also scary. Frank told Bob he wanted to do it himself, so he took me into the bathroom in the hotel and took one of those big ele ctric shavers and made me lie down on the floor and spread my legs so he could shave me. He pinched and nicked me with that razor, and just laughed when I jumped fr om the pain. Tears were running uncontrollably down my fac e, I wasn't allowed to cry but somehow, sometimes I just couldn't help it. One of the personalities that dealt with Uncle Fran k was tied directly into a system of reporting pers onalities, led by 'Sandy,' my main reporting personality. These perso nalities reported everything that happened, out of trauma- conditioning, training and terror, with no ability to lie or protect themselves. Often I was given instruction by a group of men in a darkened, smoke-filled room in Vegas . The man in charge of the security area I entered, knew me, and always wa ved me through. These men seemed to operate above t he law, above the rules, and had connections inside lots of casinos. The messages I delivered were gambling tips, information about drug and guns deals, and other il legal and hidden agendas . \"Number 9 on the line,\" was a code I was given and was sent in on many different men wit h a preprogrammed agenda. I was told a man's physic al description and where he would be at a precise time . I met him and delivered the messages I was told t o relay. If the man wanted more, I was instructed to \"follow throug h,\" if they wanted sex. At times, though, I was tol d to \"give them the slip,\" if my controllers didn't want me to have sex with them. These top men all knew to watc h out for me and someone was always \"keeping an eye\" on what I w as doing. My father or mother just disappeared, as usual; I don't know where they went or what they were doing while I was working for my controllers in Vegas. My father had connections to these men, but they tr ied not to be seen together. They exhibited secret hand signals to each other from a distance. I watched as my father performed these signals, and in Vegas he always wor e his diamond pinky ring. He raised his hands, crossed his arms and displayed his first two fingers. Then he shook his arms down once . A man watching him mirrored the same motion back to him then scratched his nose, after which they immediately turned away from each other. My fa ther took me up to our hotel room where he escorted me around the room and \"cued\" me to certain things in the room. I was given suggestions that whenever I t ouched the gold fixtures in the bathroom I would forever forge t what I'd been involved in. While holding my right shoulder with his hand, my father gave me the suggestion, \"y ou will open the door, normally, and naturally, wid e awake and ready for work, whenever I knock twice.\" He knocked twice on the door to demonstrate. He cued me to th e telephone, either instructing me to answer it or la ter on when I was married to let Craig answer. At times my father would bring clothing, jewelry, o r props for assignments. In a total trance state, I listened intently while he filled my head with instructions - times t o report to different room numbers, who to look for and the message to deliver. My father would \"snap me out of it,\" by snapping his fingers. There were times he slapped me to access different personalities. Sometimes they h ad me so booked with men for sex that they had to p rogram me to go to the bathroom in between men; I was so robotic al I wouldn't remember to go to the bathroom or eve n be able to feel that I had to. I was just one big act, as I we nt from room to room with sometimes as many as four men a night. Each man had to have at least two hours. Bob said t hat was minimum time to have to wind up and then ha ve to wind"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"down (he pretended he was screwing something tightl y and then he changed directions and started humpin g). I looped all around the hotels, from room to room, ha ving sex with men. I was instructed to start at 8 p.m. and then did another man at 10, and one at 12, and the last at 2. At 4 a.m. I was finished . It was a nightmarish swirl of endless men . I performed the sex acts, was electro shocked in between and then switched personalities and went on . They were Bob's friends, Uncle Frank's friends, mob connections, entertainers and politicians. They ha d lots of friends between the two of them. They nearly owned Congress . Uncle Frank reminded me I'd be meeting St. Peter if I didn't cooperate and toe the line. He told me abo ut St. Peter at the Pearly Gates and explained why I would be there - which was because he needed to kill me beca use I stepped out of line. This was in the late 60' s and early 70's, before my kids were born. Once they were born these men used threats related to my kids to terrorize m e. Bob would throw his arm around Uncle Frank's neck, wink at him and say, \"Take care of her Frank.\" That's w hen I knew I had gotten out of line again and was terrified, w aiting in anxious anticipation for my punishment. F rank slapped me over and over, sometimes until my cheeks were st inging and burning like they were on fire. Then he would throw his head back and laugh. He was obviously ver y sadistic. Sometimes Bob would fly in just to have a quick meeting with Frank. Sometimes I flew with him for a quickie. Brutal pornography was filmed at the Landmark Hotel in Vegas during my late teens and early 20's (1968 -74). They used costumes and sex toys, and had themes for the porn that was often violent. At times people were killed in the porn . They didn't kill me because I was a programmed as set and they had far-reaching plans for me. Uncle Frank could have had me killed if he wanted to. He had f riends who killed people quickly and neatly. He showed me what his friends could do and I was forced to watch as they tortured and killed p eople . Then I knew I could be snuffed at any moment and that everyone, i ncluding Bob, knew what I was doing. I couldn't com prehend that there wasn't any mysterious, miraculous reason why they knew exactly where I was; in essence, the y knew because they had sent me there! In my programmed re ality I believed that my controllers magically knew everything I did. Uncle Frank played the following song for me to listen to, the words of which I will write as well as my memory serves me: \"Anybody here seen my ole' friend John? Can you tel l me where he's gone? You meet a lot of people but it seems the good they die young, you just look around and they're gone. Anybody here seen my ole' friend Martin? Can you te ll me where he's gone? You meet a lot of people but it seems the good they die young, you just look around and they're gone. Anybody here seen my ole 'friend Bobby? Can you tel l me where he's gone? You meet a lot of people but it seems the good they die young, you just look around and they're gone.\" While I listened, strapped to a chair, Uncle Frank sat and tapped his foot and when the song was finis hed he asked me, \"You got that?\" Then he slapped me over and ove r. He said the Kennedy brothers got what they deserved for being stupid and stepping out of line . He said, \"At anytime you could be next if you get stupid on me.\" I still feel like crying when I hear that song. Tahoe was connected to the Mob also and many entertainers performing in Vegas and Tahoe/Reno were used by the Mob. I believe Helen Reddy and Karen Carpenter may have been manipulated also . I was programmed to some of Karen Carpenter's songs and felt very sad w hen she died, like I knew her. I believe she was also under mind control . Bob supplied the Mob with illegal business and ac cess to his political connections, and they supplie d him with protection and connections all over the world. They were networked up, and inter-linked all over the place. There were certain favorites in Vegas that Bob shar ed me with. Jimmy the Greek was a very scary mobster to me . He would threaten to kill me if I even looked the wrong way. He constantly changed his mind about what he wanted and it was hard to please him or to get what he in structed right. He would tell me to do something and then he would change his mind, but forget to tell me. He s lapped me to the ground for not doing what I was told. He set up connections in Las Vegas and was in charge of send ing me out to targeted individuals, but he always \"wanted a li ttle,\" before he sent me to have sex with someone e lse. I remember his visual image in my mind as a dark comp lexioned mobster, and he spoke in that 'kind of mob accent' -"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"broken and slangish English. He spoke in different sing-songy \"lines\" and I didn't always know what th ey meant. He gave me a message for Bob and included some phra se about a \"donkey's tail\" or \"elephant's ears\" and , at that time, I didn't know what the message meant. Now tha t I am free of mind control, of course I can tell w hat the nature of the messages were that were being sent through m e, and this one obviously was referring to the poli tical parties. He wore a diamond pinky ring on his left hand. I th ink wearing diamond pinky rings on their left had m eant something, because my father also wore his diamond pinky ring whenever he took me to Vegas. Jimmy the Greek directed me often in Vegas and set me up with peopl e I was to be prostituted to . Of course, the Council had previously pre-programmed me for use wi th the people Jimmy the Greek put me with. I don't know how they all knew whom I was going to be with, but Bob Hope, Henry Kissinger and the Council always decided ahead of time . Maybe Jimmy was working for them in Vegas. During the late 60's and 70's, lots of big names were in Vegas and I was prostitut ed to them at night . Elvis, Sammy Davis, Jr., Ed McMahon, Johnny Carson, Jimmy Dean , and others. My father took me to Vegas until I wa s over twenty-one years old, after that, my husband and I went without my parents. Craig would take me up to the room after a dinner show and tell me he would be back la ter, that he was going down to gamble. I often begged my husband not to leave me, but he acted like I was ov erreacting and would leave me anyway . Soon after he left, the men in suits would come and get me, and I would be taken to perform for our controllers. More About Elvis ...He Was Also A Robot The Mob and others had hold of Elvis Presley . Uncle Frank sent me in on Elvis to perform \"favors .\" I was instructed to have sex with him and tell him things that they wanted him to know or say in a show or a song , or to do . If he didn't do as they said, they threatened or to rtured him or \"his ole lady,\" as he called her . I didn't know who she was, couldn't think to. They ruled Elvis and se nt me in before his shows to instruct him what to s ay or do during his next performance. He was usually so out of it o n drugs that he couldn't \"do the sex thing,\" he'd s ay, so I would tell him what to say or whatever the message was to deliver to the audience. After that, Elvis would p ass out on the bed, perspiring. He was handsome, even when he was like that, until he started gaining all the weight. Then he looked very pathetic. I was used with Elvis until he died. The last time they sent me in to be with him he was nearly unconscious . I don't know what they did to him but they used him up and then felt afraid he would \"crack\" and spill what he knew so they kept him drugged until they couldn't safely us e him anymore and then he \"died .\" Of course it wasn't an accident or a natural death, he had a lot of help f rom his controllers. Elvis was targeted heavily by these men. When I was given messages to deliver to Elvis or others, they would inject my arm with some drug and then unless I had been pr eprogrammed, they quickly whispered the message int o my mind files and sent me off to deliver them to Elvis . Then Elvis would use the phrases he was told as he introduced his songs or in the early days they might have beco me a part of new song lyrics . Just a single key phrase was enough to keep the programmed individuals, who late r heard the introduction or song, under control. Th en, many slaves were \"drawn to him,\" or they did things as a result of the effects of the harmonics in his voic e, in his music, and in the orchestration. But at concerts the messages were often delivered d irectly through words he would use to introduce his songs . He was no different than Michael Jackson , who replaced him in many ways. In my opinion, both were controlled. My controllers often gave me the key to his suite a nd sent me there late at night with a message to de liver after sex with 'The King.' In the beginning, when I was 18, 1 9, and 20, he was more receptive and we had sex, us ually with me on top most of the time and then I would whisper the message in his ear. Sometimes the messages to him were in the form of words from his own songs, but all th e words weren't there and it would take on a differ ent meaning. Like, \"Wise men say, only fools rush in,\" and then there would be words, numbers, or codes that I deli vered that I didn't even understand. He was told certain 'lines' to say in between certain songs and I feel he may have been keeping many women 'in line' and programmed by thes e phrases. When he slipped the messages in between songs, as pre-instructed, the messages went deeply into th e subconscious minds of the audience , especially to those individuals who were programmed to react to univers al words that are common to virtually all high-leve l,"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"programmed individuals. They are simple words that when put into a certain sequence have a great impac t on people who have been pre-conditioned with programmi ng. In his later years , when I was in my early twenties, Elvis became mor e and more 'out of it' when I went into his suite. He was always alone when I got there, which surpris ed me . He was usually already in bed asleep and I'd be given the key to go in and he wouldn't even sit up or act surprised that I was there. He was totally o ut of it from his addictions to drugs and alcohol . Elvis had tons of pill bottles on the nightstand , and groggily said he needed them all. Sometimes he was even listless and couldn't ha ve an erection; any attempt at sex was futile. So I couldn't always do my job as instructed, but would give him the ver bal messages and then slipped out, always \"leaving the key behind with the memories,\" as my programming dictat ed. From my experience I believe Elvis was a puppet, a pawn, and in the end, totally dire cted and, finally, used up by these men in control of him . It was my experience that the images he portrayed on stage were nothing like how he was in private. To demonstrate this, I'll share wha t I remembered; but, before I do, I will tell you t hat retrieving these memories was very sensorially uncomfortable, due to the completeness of the olfactory portion of the memory. You'll understand as you read further. It was late at night when I entered Elvis's room. H e was lying in bed, still adorned with the gold jew elry and white suit he wore in concert. I watched as he finished h is room service dinner and then I waited while he t hrew up in the bathroom. He was very mad at himself because he was so fat and he said he had to lose weight for the shows. I guess he made himself throw up. All I really know i s that I overheard him throwing up in the bathroom and when he came back to the bed, he smelled like vomit. It was n't long before he jumped up again and I followed h im as he went back into the bathroom. He cried as he stood in front of the mirror, and hi tting the counter with both hands he screamed, \" I hate my life! Everything's out of control and now you want me to f--k you and I can't! I'm ruined! I 'm a failure!\" I put my hand on his back in support and then on th e back of his neck. As he felt my touch, his head h ung down even further over the sink and he cried, \" God, I'm a mess. I don't know what happened, just a ll of a sudden, I'm destroyed .\" Then he screamed, \" What is wrong? What is wrong with me !\" and he started pulling his hair. I pulled him up. When he turned around I hugged him and he j ust kept crying and crying and almost collapsed in my arms. I guided him back to bed and helped him lay down. He was sideways on the bed but I couldn't get him stra ightened out so as programmed, I lay next to him and rubbed his chest. His shirt was opened and his very hairy chest turned me on, but he was passed out. His mouth was open an d he was breathing but he was totally out of it. I covered him with the bedspread and tiptoed out of the room. My father was standing outside, just down the hallw ay. He was wearing a beige suit and when he snapped his fingers, with the hand wearing the diamond pinky ri ng, I listened intently to all the directions he co mmanded and he told me to follow him. He guided me downstairs to m y room with Craig, unlocked and opened the door and waited for me to get inside before he hit me high in my ba ck with a stun gun. I collapsed to the floor and he pulled the door shut. He almost slammed me in the door. I just lay there awhile and then when, \"I came around\" (that's what they called it), I crawled to the bathroom and managed t o get into the bathtub. The soothing water revived me but I felt very sick, drugged and out of it. I had trouble kee ping my eyes open but managed to get out of the tub , dry and put on a white nightie to wear to bed. Slowly and wobbl y, I shakily made my way to the bed and got in next to Craig. I felt very sick for the next two days and had troubl e eating. I felt exhausted and very nauseated, but had no way to access my own brain in order to know why. After awhile Elvis couldn't function any longer. Henry and his buddies laughed and said that Elvis was like the tin man, all rusted up and ready for the junkyard . They waited for him to become seriously dysfunction al from the increasing amount of drugs prescribed by his doctor s . Then they \"stopped his ticker for him so he didn' t have to suffer no more.\" I think Frank and his friends were in on the \"do in.\" Playing Goldilocks and The Three Bears "},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Bob called it \"Playing Goldilocks and the Three Bea rs.\" And he had me play that game with him and his friends in Vegas and other places. Some nights in Vegas, I'd p lay Goldilocks looking for a good bed with Dean Martin, Gene Kelly, Mickey Rooney (until Kelly was born). Mickey Rooney is, among other things a pedophile and was afraid of publicly being caught with a child but he felt s afe having a slave child . He thought he wouldn't be caught. Gene Kelly liked to do the ole' soft-shoe for me. He always s melled of a different sort of weird cologne like Au de Bamboo. It was spicy and he'd wear a silk robe and dance around like he was in some musical play, befo re he sat down on the edge of the bed for me to attend to him . I took off his robe, kneeled down and gave him or al sex while he was sitting up. Half way through I gently pushed him back on the bed with the instructions to, \"lay back so you can totally relax and enjoy. That's what my command is for you.\" And as he came in my mouth, I ate it like it was frosting, as my programming dictated, \"good to the last drop,\" and finally I looked deeply in his eyes and said, \"You were delicious.\" Nearly asleep he said, \"Thank you, please let yourself out.\" So I did. But I didn't k now where to go so I just sat down on the top of the large staircas e leading downstairs. My mom came to get me. She wa lked up the stairs dressed in a light brown fur jacket and a be ige brown knit dress with sandled high heels and to ok me by the hand and led me downstairs. When I was really out o f it she led me almost like I was blind. I can reme mber hearing her charm bracelet jingling. She often put my left arm under hers and \"walked me places.\" One night Fr ank Sinatra intercepted her in an elevator while she was walkin g me back to the room, and roughed her up in front of me, to show us both who was in charge. Due to mind control , my mother still doesn't remember this or any othe r of the traumatic experiences that were done to her in orde r to keep us all under control. More About the Mob Some of the same factions of the Mob that were conn ected to the Kennedy’s were also connected to Presi dent Nixon, Reagan and other presidents. Obviously this faction had become connected to national politics l ong before I came onto the scene and was already in tight, runni ng a lot of business through the government and tak ing full advantage of political knowledge, insight, and posi tion. I know because I ran messages from the Mob to U. S. presidents and back again for years . Key Biscayne was another location where I was con nected to the Mob and was told that there was no getting out - or so they sai d. There was some guy they called \"Freddie\" and oth er mobsters who were politically connected. BeBe Rebozo was con nected to the Mob and to Nixon and he was public bu t not as mob-connected as the inner Mob. It was almost like BeBe was an ambassador to the Mob . The mob guys scared me because for the most part th ey got what they wanted, any way they wanted and, o ften, that meant hurting me for information. One time they pin ched my fingers to the point of almost smashing the m. I didn't nor couldn't respond and so they kept increasing th e torture. There were times when they nearly killed me trying to gain information I carried. Usually they lacked the technical knowledge of my codes, keys and triggers and didn't possess the technological sophistication to underst and my programming. So, they couldn't get as much o ut of me as others who knew that I was a robot and could access me in that way. One time when the Mob was interrog ating me they tied me to a chair and one guy slapped me whil e another guy in a leather jacket asked me question s. I overheard him say, \" These bastards are selling their own women. How low can you stoop ?\" It was incidents like these which told me that at least someone, even if it was the Mob, had some sort of humanity left with in its membership. One time, mob guys put a needle into my eye to try to get me to talk, but it didn't help. The needle m ust have hit a nerve and my whole body jolted back. They couldn't understand how a woman could endure s o much torture and they began to 'respect' me . They just didn't understand that I wasn't really brave, I just couldn't respond due to years of conditioning and sophisticated programming that rendered me completely dissociative and not in cont rol of myself. By the time they figured this out they had already tortured me half to death. I was a total ro bot, programmed not to respond to pain or torture, and there were m any mob-connected meetings in which I was involved in Vegas, Tahoe, Reno, Key Biscayne and other places. By the time they understood more about how to get i nformation from me, my access routes or codes ended up getting pass ed around . My husband just stepped aside and let them have me, as he was programmed to do. There was never any one to protect me. The Mob involvement began in my early teens and continued for years. Sometimes when they would get me into a room in Veg as they would accuse me of \"carrying a wire \" but I wasn't. They would strip me to check and some goon would en d up raping me. They didn't understand yet the level of"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"sophisticated programming that allowed me to record everything I was hearing, via mind files and photo graphic memory . Later, my programmers would instill messages that were to \"kick in\" when I was accessed by the Mob. Then, upon my return, I was activated to deliver a message to them and they acted shocked when I would deliver the message. The Mob often thought I was trying to get to some of the rich tycoons that sat at the Bac carat tables. I was usually sent to target someone there but they d idn't know who or why. They never seemed to know th at I wasn't ever operating from my own agenda. What they had to offer the group I was working for was minimal. The Council was going for higher stakes and most of the time, t hey saw these mobsters as worker-bees . But they all had their places in the pecking order. Over the years I was known in Vegas by the Mob there. Some mobsters were connected to Bob Hope in Palm Springs and others to Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra. I used to be afraid that they would kill my childre n or me, but it will never stop me from doing what I know is right, now that I'm no longer under mind control. Somehow or other they knew everybody and controlled faction s of business, politics, and people. Mickey Levinson, sa id I was \"family\" now, after my brother Rick and hi s first wife Leslie (Mickey's niece) were married. \"To be afraid is to have more faith in evil than in God.\" -- Emmet Fox Chapter Seventeen The Rat Pack \"Birds of a feather, flock together...\" I was programmed to stay thin, tan, and silly, and to act like a stereotypical dumb blonde. One warm a nd beautiful Southern California summer day, I brushed the Malib u Beach sand from my bikini and feet, and jumped in to my car to head down Pacific Coast Highway to my next assig nment. Clad only in my bikini, a short white lace c over-up and sandals, I headed into the Malibu Courthouse. T he woman at the desk waved me through to the judge' s private quarters. Without hesitation, I entered the judge's office an d climbed into Judge Merrick's lap - sand, suntan lotion, and all. He laughed, sat back, and enjoyed the atte ntion as I precociously performed my sexual acts on him. I satisfied him sexually and left as quickly as I had arrived. Bob had a joke for me to say to judges as a means for variety of orgasmic experiences. When a judge was o rgasming he pre-programmed me to say, \"Here come th e judge, here come the judge,\" like they said on Laug h-In, the popular television show of the time. Bob also had me instilled with top tunes, like a ju kebox. I had a personality system that delivered im promptu verses from songs at the perfect time so that they would c leverly fit into a social situation. I had personal ities that could sing the songs very closely to the way the original artists sang them. I knew the words perfectly and sang with similar inflections and tones as the singers. Lots of people thought I was very adroit when I cleverly popped a song into a conversation, but I was really programmed to do that. Bob sent me to have sex with Casey Kasem , the KRLA Disc Jockey. Then the next day, I had to listen to his station all day long because he gave histories and stories about the singers of the current popular so ngs just before he played their records. Bob said I had to listen the whole day because it was important to \"keep my lid on tight.\" Bob told me to think of myself as a tras h can and that no matter what, he would always be there to hold th e lid on. He used this trash can memory-stuffer and scrambler idea on me for a long time. My oldest brother, Jim, undoubtedly under his own programming, was used to help keep me in line by having me watch Sesame Street. I was told to sit down in front of the television and wat ch with his children and if my eyes moved away from the screen my brother would rap my knuckles. Watching the Cook ie Monster trash can character in the show 're-minded' me to 'keep the lid on.' During this time in my life, I was finishing up hig h school, and although my parents and school counse lors reminded me that I wasn't college material, I was l ooking forward to attending junior college at Pierc e College in Woodland Hills. Craig and I had been going steady s ince we were thirteen years old and except for a br ief break-up in high school, I did not date any other boys. Crai g prepared to go to the University of Colorado. I w as completely unaware that secretly laced into my life was a whol e array of discreetly hidden sexual rendezvous with men in"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"powerful, yet diversified, positions. I was filmed pornographically in many locations, including Woodl and Hills, Hollywood, Malibu, Bel Aire, Studio City, other are as in the San Fernando Valley, and varied locations all over California. I also worked for a short time for Harold Anderson Construction Company in Bel Aire , but don't remember exactly what I did to work for him. I do r emember lots of pornography being filmed at this st age of my life and the level of pornographic filming was more professional. There were themes, costumes, music, professional make-up, special props and lighting. Personalities inside of me were taught how to work with the light ing to catch the best poses, and to move my body so the filming crew could get the best shots. Upon completion of t he filming, I went home to my mother and father in Woodland Hills and later might even go on a date with Craig, full y believing that I was an innocent, loyal and loving girlfriend . Due to the mind control I was under, I had no way of knowing that I was leading anything other than a normal lif e, as a normal teenager, in a normal family, in Woo dland Hills. The extensive contact I had with Bob Hope as a teenager and during my early 20's showed me t hat Bob was much more than an entertainer. Entertainment was actuall y just a clever hobby of his. I witnessed his participation as a strategically placed, influential, and integral par t of an underworld group that secretly sought to co ntrol the world. He had direct ties to the White House, but not dire ct phone lines like Nelson Rockefeller had. Through my affiliation with Bob Hope, I was to meet and interact with many powerful businessmen, polit icians, and celebrities. I was flown into a small airport i n Palm Springs to be with Bob and his cronies. I wa s picked up by a silver limo and taken to his house. The men in su its met me and took me to Bob, wherever he was - at home, on the golf course, or in town. Before I was delivered to Bob, they gave me clothes, shoes, and jewelry t o adorn myself. If Bob was in a meeting or at the club with 'the guys,' he would motion me over towards him an d say, \"Let me have a look at you honey.\" He often raised his e yebrows as if to say I met with his approval and/or was sexy enough for him, and then he would pull me to him an d sit me on his lap. He wanted to show his buddies that he had what he called \"a sweet young thing.\" Depending on which crowd we were with, he would introduce me as his niece, his budding starlet prodigy, or his \"sweet y oung thing.\" Bob very often introduced me as his \"f avorite niece, Sharon Weatherby.\" I guess he left people to their own conclusions. But he never did refer to me by my own name - NEVER! I often accompanied Bob to the golf course in Palm Springs. One day he was dressed casually, in light blue slacks, pastel yellow shirt, white belt and white golf shoe s. There were several other men golfing with him. I was there just to serve Bob. I was seventeen or eighteen, thin, ta n, blonde and dressed in a tiny white dress with sp aghetti straps. I wore white sandals that came up from my toe and met at a strap around my ankle, with a gold heart ankl et on my left ankle. Bob or the men in suits always gave me everything to wear. I was not invited to play the g olf game, but was instructed to watch and SMILE! This particular day Bob sang to me, as he did at other times when h e was feeling jovial in spirit, \"Button up your overcoat, take good care of yourself you belong to me.\" He s ang and joked with me often like I was able to really react and r espond to him. As a programmed slave, I was merely compliant and smiled all the time. After the golf game, we al l went to the clubhouse and had dinner. A lady appr oached with a camera, attempting to photograph Bob. The men in su its denied her access. People often tried to take p ictures but he directed someone to get the camera and remove the f ilm. He commented on how rude people were to interr upt or to invade his privacy like that. There usually were no t many (if any) people in places we frequented, unl ess it was for a show and then he had bodyguards to protect him. At this dinner, when his male group hit upon a \"sen sitive\" subject, Bob asked me to go powder my nose for awhile and handed me some money. I knew that meant to be g one for a long while. After what seemed like \"a lon g while\" had passed, I kept checking back to see if it was t ime for him to motion me back, as was his custom. F inally, he waved me over to join them and pulled me onto his l ap. Sometimes Bob met with men I recognized as Secr et Service agents from seeing them previously with Ric hard Nixon or Ronald Reagan. After these \"meetings\" we would often go by limo to a hotel or to his home wh en no one was there. Most of the time his wife, Dol ores, was not at home. Bob and Dolores On other occasions when we were with people and he wanted me to leave, Bob would pat my bottom and say good- bye with a smile. Then the men in suits would step in and get me. Usually I was taken back to his hous e to get ready for an evening event. Bob enjoyed having people aro und. He had parties attended by lots of famous peop le."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Sometimes I was given as a gift to one or more of h is friends for the night, but was programmed to ret urn to his room to sleep. Unless Dolores was home. Dolores was not there often, but when she was, I was usually f lown home early. It was strange the few times I did see Dolor es at a party, knowing that I was having sex with B ob and had accompanied him to different places with his friend s and business associates. I couldn't think to ques tion what Dolores thought her husband did! Bob introduced me to many of his \"famous\" friends. At gatherings, wit h one arm around me he would elbow the guys and say, \" Why would I want to be with an ole' bag like Dolores , when I can have this ?\" And his friends would laugh and nod in agreement . Although my programming kept these activities hidden from my conscious mind, later I would wake u p late in the mornings in my own bed in Woodland Hi lls, with burning, red eyes, feeling totally exhausted, after what I thought was a full night's sleep. I was not able to understand that the exhaustion was actually caused by food, water, and sleep deprivation, coupled with drugs and electroshock for programming purposes. Bob had lots of security at his home in Palm Spring s. The lights on the outside of his house came on a t night automatically when a car approached. He also had nu merous security alarms and systems in the house eve n a television monitor like Reagan had at his ranch. Wh en I arrived, he would sit me on the bed and he wou ld sit in the chair and say, \"Okay, let me hear it.\" And I'd ratt le off what Henry Kissinger told me to tell him. Bo b didn't have all the sophisticated numerical codes to my mind files that Henry did. Henry wanted it that way. I overhea rd Henry speak out loud to himself in front of me, saying, \" I want you to be security safe.\" Henry put into my system of reporting personalities instructions to tell him if Bob tried anything out of line. I was instructed t o report to Henry if Bob tried to access information he wasn't involved in and wasn't suppose to be privy to. Henry said, \" It's none of his business.\" Dolores Hope was elderly when Bob was fooling aroun d with me; so was he, since he was nearly fifty yea rs my senior. She did not like it when I was around and, unfortunately, Bob didn't have much of an excuse fo r my presence, unlike Reagan. Reagan could say I was his secretary or aide, but Bob told his wife he was sp ending lots of time with me to \"groom me\" for the shows for the bo ys. I can remember hearing Dolores nagging at him w hile I was still there one morning after a party in Palm S prings. He lied and told her I was there with some other man at the party. Not that I did not have sex frequently w ith many of his friends and business associates, bu t this time I had not. When Dolores confronted him on these issues, B ob would stand behind her, and like a child, made f aces insinuating she was going on and on and on and he w as bored to tears. He heard her out, mimicking her behind her back, and then we would leave for the golf course t ogether. But, to her face, he always played it cool , acted lovey, and sent her off shopping or vacationing. Bob calle d Dolores \"dear\" a lot. He would tell her he had to introduce me to some of his business associates so I would get t o know the ropes. It was all a front, just a cover to use me for sex. Although I did meet a lot of businessmen and friend s of Bob's and I did go with him, at times, to rehe arse for the shows and do the voice-over tapes for some of the t ours, most of it was for his sexual pleasure and to show his old friends that he could still get \"the young stuff.\" I certainly was never there by choice. I was a comp lete slave, under total mind control, with no abili ty to choose consciously for myself what or where I wanted to be , or even to know who I really was! I did not consc iously know that I was being used in these ways. I simply thoug ht that I was a normal student and I continued to c arry the belief to my marriage bed that I was a virgin. At times, t he entertainer, Phyllis Diller , was at Bob's parties. She was really loud. She did not particularly care for me and just brushed me aside. She was always joking. Phyllis a nd Bob came up with one joke after another. Once when I was smi ling adoringly at Bob, she yelled at me, \"Wipe that smile off your face.\" Then she laughed that real loud laugh, and it frightened me. Bob told me not to pay attent ion to \"that ole' bag,\" so I tried not to, but she was so loud it was hard to ignore her. I tried to avoid Phyllis Dille r's disapproval at all costs. At one time, Bob's bedroom was decorated in a large floral print with creme-colored background. He had a wooden bed frame and nightstands and a large closet. Somet imes there were fresh flowers placed in the room or one on the pillow. Bob usually had a new nightie waiting on th e bed for me to wear and sometimes there were satin sheets on the bed. A drawer in his room was filled with all s orts of sexy panties, bras, nighties, and so on, an d he said they were there just for me. He always went to the drawe r and selected what I was to wear. He also had clot hes in the back of his closet that were just my size. I don't know who bought them, but they always fit me. I was usually programmed to maintain a \"perfect size six,\" althou gh there were times I fell below that and wore a si ze two or four. My weight was within 99-102 Ibs. in those days and I was 5' 5\" tall. \"Young and lovely,\" he would say. "},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Since deprogramming and speaking out publicly, I've met other programmed sex slaves who were also with Bob. Most likely we were all programmed to be the same s ize, and Bob just said the clothes were for me, but they were available for a number of his girls. Bob preferred 18-20 year olds. Bob had an average size penis. Sometimes Bob fright ened me during sex, when he got aggressive, but he never physically hurt me. He \"let\" me do everything sexua lly I was trained and programmed to do, but he like d to orgasm in his own way. Then he would go to sleep. As he got older, he got meaner and stranger and sub consciously I hated him . There was a small metal high voltage cattle prod that Bob would insert in my vagina at times. He use d that on me after sex late at night when we were in bed. Aft er that it was \"lights out\" and I didn't remember a nything else. Bob slapped me at times, if I got out of line, whic h was also part of a program to stay in line. When I got slapped, I would switch into a different personality and then I would be happier, more \"congenial\" he would say, and he would lift my chin and kiss me. Once when he was mad at m e for some infraction of the rules, Bob yelled, \"Yo u're just a wind up doll - a toy for my pleasure, and don't for get it!\" Hugh Hefner's Bob referred to me in my earlier teenage years as h is \"little bunny.\" He was friends with Hugh Hefner and Hugh came to Bob's parties sometimes. He always brought at least two women with him, usua lly blondes . Starlite was my personality that Bob named to become his \"starlet.\" He told Starlite, and other people when I was on h is \"arm,\" that he was giving me a \"leg up\" into the industry. My i nstructions were that Starlite was to wear her hair parted on the side with it combed down over one eye for a sexy lo ok. She was to act very sexy. When Bob took me to p arties he would tell everyone he was showing me the ropes, th at I had endless talent and potential in the indust ry. Bob took me to several of Hugh Hefner's penthouse p arties in Los Angeles. On one of these occasions, B ob went all out on his outfit. He wore a grey suit and ascot wi th a white tux shirt and a grey top hat and white g loves. He looked 'dapper' but old to me, though his clothes were per fect - not one wrinkle. There was a door panel, wit h small silver buttons on it that you had to push in a certain seq uence to gain access to Hefner's penthouse. Bob kne w the numerical code. I watched the perfectly manicured h and that stretched out of his clean, neat, white st arched shirt sleeve go out from his black jacket as he punched i n the sequence. The elevator up to Hefner's had mirrors and Bob sai d, \"You look nice tonight, honey.\" \"Thanks, Bob.\" I replied as he took my elbow from behind and said as he turned me around, \"Look into the mirror. You can see yours elf over and over and over again without end. Like a file, w e will slip one out of a slot or like in the jukebo x when one record is selected. This evening I want to select a sexy prom girl who is beautiful, intelligent, and submissive. Sexy is always the most important quality. Do you unders tand?\" After I slowly nodded my head yes, he contin ued, \"You are to stay close by my side this evening. There wi ll be no intermissions so don't ask for any. You wi ll simply stay close to my side. Is everything understood?\" I smil ed and said yes. Next he turned me away from the 'i nfinity mirror' used for 'reminding' me in order to select from one of my many personalities, and we went thro ugh the elevator door as it opened moments later. My dress made crackling noises as I walked and I ha d a matching black cape. When we arrived I handed m y wrap to the doorman, a tall handsome man in a tux. And h e, in turn, handed it to another man and replied, \" This is for the lady with Bob.\" Holding my cape, the older doorman looked me in the eye, and bowing his head said, \"Ma 'am,\" before leaving with my cape and Bob's show cane. Bo b took my arm and guided me over to the fireplace w here a zebra painted girl walked through the fire without being burned. Her naked voluptuous body was painted all over with thick black and white paint stripes. The paint gave an appearance of dress but you could clearly see that she was naked. She smiled at Bob and continued dancing in very seductive poses within a very small area. S he had a very haunting faraway look in her eyes. There were windows all around and at night you could see a bre athtaking panoramic view of all the pretty twinkling lights o f the city below. They looked like jewels on a blac k velvet background. Bob told me that when I was \"on his arm \" for the evening that he was mine, but at other ti mes he was someone else's. The stars liked their parties because no one gawked at them like fans did in public places. Everyone w as more equal and they could enjoy being normal like other people when they were at ease with peers. Hefner's partie s were a"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"place where many stars gathered and shared, a playg round for the stars and their playmates. It seemed people floated in and out of Hefner's parties and there we re times when there were not very many people. From what I saw people didn't necessarily come there to group toget her for the party. It was more like a place people got stimulated, wowed, and entertained in order to have their own p rivate experiences and fun . Hefner's place was very modern, full of sharp lines and angles with lots of glass, and w as some kind of meeting place for the stars and the wealthy upper class. Bob got ideas from Hefner's parties that he used at his own parties in \"the Springs.\" Bob's par ties were pure class, in the most exquisite Hollywood style. He ha d wild parties and some night's there were orgies. Noticing Bob had arrived, Hugh Hefner came over and shook Bob's hand. Bob said, \"Hal, this is my main tease ...I me an main squeeze.\" They both laughed and Bob leaned over and whispered something I couldn't hear to Hefner. Hef ner never stayed around long to talk with Bob at the parties. \"Bob, it's good to see you.\" They shook hands again and Hefner placed his other hand on Bob's elbow an d said, \"I'll be back, don't go away, I just have to catch her be fore she gets away.\" He seemed to acknowledge his g uests and then quickly excused himself. In a moment he return ed and said, \"Step into my kitchen.\" Bob sneered an d said to him, \"I'll follow you anywhere the girls are!\" So w e followed Hefner into the kitchen where lots of pl ayboy bunnies dressed in traditional black bunny outfits with bla ck and white bow ties, fish net stockings, and blac k high heels were busy preparing food trays. Bob's eyebrows rais ed and with obvious sexual emphasis, he called out, \"WHAT'S TO EAT!\" All the girls turned around and laughed an d looking seductively at him sang out, almost in un ison, \"Hi, Mr. Hope!\" One bunny said, \"I'm available!\" and she laughed as she arranged the butter squares that we re stamped with the playboy insignia. Bob said, \"Well, maybe y ou can be course number five, honey. How's about yo u and I meeting at that course.\" \"Yes,\" she teased. Bob loo ked around the room, \"Any other's?\" No one took him up on it but they smiled cordially. Bob ushered me back out to the room where the zebra girl was still dancing. \"She's still at it,\" he announced and I smiled up adoringly at him, just like I was programmed to do. Bob took a drink off a tray that a bunny offered hi m and when she offered me a choice of the different drinks, per program, I smiled and recited, \"No thank you, I've had my quota for the evening.\" Although I'd really not eaten or drank anything for hours. Bob was good at taking a drink and then setting it down somewhere out of the way like he didn't want anyone to know he wasn't really drinkin g. Later on he'd take another drink or two, but I r arely saw him drink much of it before he set it down, abandoned i t and moved on. Hugh Hefner had bizarre, exotic entertainment at his parties ... naked women painted like animals ...or tamed wild animals, like lions that were 'whipped into shape' by a playboy bunny. One time he even had a man dres sed like Tarzan whipping a playgirl dressed like Jane. They said the girl was not really being hurt, that it wa s just an illusion. I don't know if that was true. There were often scenes like that - magic sex shows . Bob instructed me to pay attention, to watch the pl ayboy bunnies so I could acquire 'bunny skills' and know some of the moves for our shows with the troops or get my e dges polished so I'd be poised and ready for the Ro ckefellers. Bob was very impressed with the Rockefellers. He to ok me to Hefner's because he wanted me to be \"bunny trained.\" Bob placed playboy collars on me and at o ther times put a diamond necklace round my neck for certain Hope occasions. It was a single row of diamonds tha t fit tightly around my neck. Bob liked me to wear them in private. He said I was \"in training\" and that these were \"training diamonds.\" He said that I had bette r get used to wearing diamonds because I would be treated right m y whole life, and sometimes he called me his prince ss. Food, drink, whatever anyone, except me, wanted, was alwa ys available at Hefner's parties. Champagne fountai ns were popular in those days. If someone delivered a drink - champagne, wine, etc., to me, sometimes Bob woul d let me take it and then he would quickly whisk it away. Bo b told me to hold my champagne glass and look prett y and smile but not to sip it, \"Not one little sip,\" he said. S o I didn't. He told me, \"One itty bitty little sip is all it would take for your coach to turn into a pumpkin and your beautifu l dress into rags. We don't want that now do we?\" T his reference made to the Disney classic, tied my subco nscious mind back into the Cinderella programming t hat was installed within me for the purpose of his and othe rs control. I smiled sweetly and said, \"No, Bob.\" I was not all owed to eat or drink. Bob told me to say that I had just eaten and was not hungry. Hefner was pretty unavailable at hi s own parties. I never knew why. One night, he had the current centerfold do a little show for a small group of gu ests. She had on a red sequined body suit, red heel s and a feather in her hair. She danced around and stripped for the guests. The men loved it and clapped and said, \"en core, encore...\" but she left and didn't return. "},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"There were rooms people could go into to have sex i f they wanted. One bedroom had a huge four poster b ed with black satin sheets and comforter. Bob parked me in the corner of the room while he had sex with the pl ayboy bunny he'd propositioned earlier. He did those kinds of t hings often. Having sex with an available girl at a party and then sex with me later or I'd just give him oral sex, wa s not uncommon, depending on his whim for the eveni ng. Bob got this girl into bed and kissed and mauled her and th en got on top and finished her. They seemed to forg et that I was in the room. She had real big firm breasts, and Bob always really liked those who were as he called it , \"fully endowed.\" After they finished they got out of bed a nd Bob kissed her hand and she got dressed and left , closing the big wooden double doors behind her. Bob motioned fo r me to come over to him and I picked his clothes u p off the floor and began redressing him. He always loved tha t game. I held his boxers as he put first one leg i n and then the other. While I helped him he said, \"I don't know wh at I'd do without ya kid.\" I smiled lovingly as pro grammed and retrieved his shirt and helped him on with it. The buttons were difficult and he said, \"Whew, it took a lot less to 'get it on' than it seemed to getting it off!\" And then he'd laugh at his own sexual joke. Bob said, \"Sex i s a state of mind. A state of mine I'd like to live in!\" I knelt down and put his socks and shoes back on, combed his hai r and we reemerged together and joined the party. I didn't k now most of the people. Bob said to a heavyset man in a tux who I also didn't recognize, \"This one's mine.\" \"It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.\" I said smiling. Quickl y, Bob quipped, \"She was trained at the Gloria Swanson School of Ma nners.\" And everyone around including the man laughed. The man took my hand politely but he was also laughing. I always thought people were laughing at me because I was st upid, I wasn't able to be aware that they were laug hing at Bob's jokes. I never could \"get\" the jokes, because I was programmed not to be able to think about them. If nothing was available to him sexually Bob would take me to a ho tel or we went home and had sex. He always scored, either way. At another Hefner party, when we arrived, Bob said to Hefner, \"Look who followed me home.\" Hefner said, \"Not bad Bob, not bad. Hey, tell me, where were you walking? Are there any more like her?\" Bob said, \" No they broke the mold after they made this one.\" Hefner la ughed and they shook hands again. He used both of h is hands in his handshake with Bob. He reached out in a regular handshake and then put his other hand on top. In k eeping with his usual routine, Hugh Hefner said, \"Excuse me Bob , I have some important matters to attend to. You a nd your lady enjoy. That's what it's all about here.\" And h e winked and walked away. Tarzan and Jane and a lion were at this party. The Tarzan guy had heavy make-up that made him look tan and he had blonde hair and a beautiful body. So did Jane. The lion was very small. I was allowed to touch him and the tan fur on its back was so neat it looked like it had b een evenly shaved. Suddenly, the lion turned around and opened his mouth and it really scared me! He had big teeth. Bo b laughed at my reaction and said, \"Honey, maybe yo u'd like to have one of these at home. Lions and tigers and bea rs, oh my!\" And as he cleverly weaved in a line to 'remind' me of my Wizard of Oz programming, he laughed again an d so did the people who were standing around. Littl e did they know that Bob Hope had just masterfully delive red one of the program phrases intended to keep me from remembering the life I was living, serving him as a total mind-controlled sex slave. Later at the party there was a huge square-tiled sh ower with clear glass sides and several nozzles. Lo ts of men and women all got in it at the same time and rubbed soa p all over themselves and then rubbed up against ea ch other and it ended in a huge orgy. Personally, Bob liked more of the one-on-one stuff, but liked to watch me be involved with groups, or to watch individual couples have sex. So metimes someone from the Council pre-programmed me to deliver a message to some entertainer or celebrity at a party they knew I was going to attend. I don't think Bob even knew some of the messages I was delivering. I was i nstructed to hold the message until I had gotten \"i n\" on the targeted person and then after I had made eye conta ct and had their full attention, I was to carefully \"drop the message\" always maintaining eye contact. I was usually very quiet, and when I would deliver these Council messages, Bob was not always aware I was going to speak. He was often caught off guard and would j oke about loving to be with me because he never kne w what would come out of my mouth from one minute to the n ext. He told people that I had natural wit, but I w as really programmed by others to deliver clever messages, ta ilor-made for certain select individuals. At one of Hefner's parties, Bob had me wear a black, form-fitting, lon g slinky, strapless and low-cut evening gown. A whi te flower was pinned over my left breast. I carried a black c lutch and wore black high heels. We arrived at the party in one of Bob's limos. The limo drivers always waited for us in case Bob wanted to leave at any time. Sometimes Bob would take me to the car for sex during the party or for a \"little talk\" about my behavior or about what to watch for or remember. He liked to do spankings when I was naugh ty and he would make me pull up my dress and lay na ked over his lap to be spanked. I was trained for that to be a \"turn on\" and when this happened, he got re al turned on and"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"the sex was better for him. At the parties we atten ded at Hefner's, the men did not usually show up wi th their wives. The nights I was there, it seemed like there was an unspoken rule that wives were not allowed, as if i t was their exclusive 'men's club' where repeat women were occa sional, but no wives allowed. The rooms were often smoky and loud and the people, especially the women, were so made up they looked plastic. At one party, Bob took me into a back bedroom where a playboy bunny was supposed to \"teach me some thi ngs.\" She lay naked on a white fur rug and touched hersel f all over in front of Bob and me. Bob stooped down and told me to quietly and gently step into her world. The t wo of us were touching each other while Bob said, \" What a thing of beauty you both are, like a piece of beautiful a rtwork.\" The playboy bunny took off my dress and be gan performing oral sex on me while Bob watched. I am n ot sure exactly what I \"learned,\" but from then on, I had lots of playboy bunny costumes - bunny collars, feathers to wear on my bottom, and high heel shoes to match . I ended up \"treating\" many men at Bob's parties to things I had \"learned.\" Sometimes I danced, too. I think lo ts of things may have been filmed without my knowledge. They use d dancing often in pornography. Bob would snap his finger when it was all over and I was to \"snap out of it,\" get up and go home with him or do something else. Some parts of me wanted my mom to help me, or get me out of there , but she never could. Bob would put a playboy collar around my neck and s ay, \"Is this your necklace or your collar?\" I was p rogrammed to respond to wearing those collars. When the bunny collar was on, out came Starlite the sexy show gir l personality. Sometimes Bob would put the collar on me at his hom e, \"just for the fun of it,\" he would say. The diam ond collars or necklaces were reserved for use with the Preside nts and other higher-ups. When it was time to leave , Bob got our coats from the butler and we left. Two younger hand some men, in suits, who were buff and looked sort o f like Secret Service agents, followed directly behind us and stayed with us until we entered the black limo that picked us up out front. It seemed like they were guarding Bob until we got to the safety of the limo. Somehow th e limo drivers were always there or close by and immediately broug ht the car around when Bob appeared. Once in the li mo Bob would ask me for a foot or neck rub or oral sex and , as programmed, I complied. This night he asked fo r a foot massage. \"Golden foot award,\" Bob said. \"Maybe I co uld manage to win the golden foot award since I can 't ever seem to manage a whole Oscar,\" he said, laughing at his own joke. Dean Martin I was usually one of the youngest girls at the part ies and most of the men were pretty old. Dean Martin was at a party one night and he was drunk. He wanted me to s it on his lap. Looking over at Bob slyly, Dean said , \"Come on Bob, share some of your pretty young stuff.\" I look ed to Bob for direction and he answered, \"Okay,\" sm iling broadly at his friend. Shyly, I went over and sat o n Dean Martin's lap. All eyes in the room were now on Dean. He took one of the straps from my dress down as everyo ne cheered him on. I looked over at Bob, feeling sh y and scared but smiling, as my programming dictated. The n Dean took the other strap down, pulled my dress d own, and grabbed my breast. With each move he made he slowly turned to Bob, asking for permission, \"Bob, can I take her bra off?\" \"Yes,\" Bob said with a sly smile on his f ace as everyone continued to cheer. \"Bob, can I put one of her breasts in my mouth?\" And as Bob gave his permissio n, Dean put his drink and cigarette down and leaned over to suck on my breast. He stunk like hard liquor. His e yes were all bloodshot and he spoke slowly and slur red. He scared me because I didn't know if he would hurt me . Then he asked Bob if he could remove my dress to which Bob replied, \"Yes,\" while the group hailed him again. A fter removing my dress, Dean asked, \"Bob, can I rem ove her panties?\" Bob said it was all right with him and so Dean took off my panties and laid me over a table and began sticking his finger in me. I was moving all around and making sexual noises, like I had been trained t o do. All the people watching were getting turned on and it start ed group sex. When Dean was finished, Bob came over to \"rescue me ,\" took me to the bathroom, slipped me into the sho wer and told me to get dressed, that we were going home to our own private party, now that Dean had warmed me up. Later that evening a man I didn't know approached us and said, \"Bob, you must tell me your secret. You must have something you're not telling about if you can attra ct the attentions of a pretty young girl like this. So tell me... what's your secret?\" Bob looked snidely at him and said, \" Geritol.\" And then he laughed and said, \"You don't think I'd tell you my secret do you? Then it wouldn't be a secret any longer and you'd be getting the pretty young st uff instead of me.\" And then they both laughed but the man still s eemed very curious, like he wondered how Bob did it . "},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"\"Is he paying you large sums of money?\" the man ask ed me. \"No, sir, it's a pleasure just to be with Bo b,\" I smiled, looking adoringly up to Bob like I was programmed t o do. The man shook his head and said, \"Well it's b een a pleasure to see you again Bob and to meet you Miss ...what did you say her name was?\" \"Weatherby . . . Sharon Weatherby.\" And the man smiled and said, \"A pleasur e,\" and walked away. The more that I attracted the attention of other men, the more Bob wanted me sexually that night. Frank Sinatra Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra played golf together. Wh en I was with them on the course, Bob told me to ca ll Frank Sinatra, \"Uncle Frank\" or \" Uncle Frankie.\" Over the years, \"Uncle Frankie,\" would show up as Bob's representative, 'the heavy,' to get me 'back in lin e.' He seemed to just appear at a place I was taken to and would let me see him and then quickly leave. Just the sight of him was terrifying because of the violent experiences I had with him from the time I was a teenager on. Frank Sinatra was connected high up in the Mob - very high up . Uncle Frankie displayed some Catholic behaviors and used Catholic jargon and seemed sincere as when he talked about his love for his family and country, but his actions were never supportive of what he espoused t o believe. He arranged, easily and with no remorse, many peoples' deaths , sometimes explaining to the hit men exactly how he wanted it done - at times while he was having sex with me. He once told this guy to dismember this man and thr ow his arm to the sharks . \" Let the man stay alive to watch the shark eat his a rm and then do likewise with his leg , but make sure he is still alive and watching so you guys will have to do it quickly. Use a chain saw for all I care and tell the bastard his whole body will be next and that his ar m and leg were just appetizers for the sharks.\" I was horrified but knew better than to even acknow ledge I heard anything, so I smiled and acted like I wasn't even listening and went to sexually satisfy him to insur e my safety. Frank said, \"Wait a minute doll, I hav e to attend to business first.\" So I lay there and waited, runnin g my hands in short little nervous motions all over his chest. After the hit man left, Frank started biting me all over and acted like he was in a good mood and was playin g with me. But I will tell you he thought nothing of having so meone killed and there were times I overheard him ask for a personal item of the persons returned to him for as surance that the job had been done . One time he threw a ring from a man he'd had killed into a waterway. The wat er was flowing fast and he told me the ring would b e swept far away from where he had originally dumped it. I just smiled and took his hand. I was always trying to p lease him in order to stay alive. Bing Crosby One Christmas, Bob gave me as a surprise sexual pre sent to his good friend and peer, Bing Crosby . Bing had just finished the taping of his Christmas show. Bob had me installed and waiting in a closet in Bing's dres sing room and I was instructed to, \"Stand there like a mannequin, without moving until Bing opens the door.\" Bob put me into a 'stay stiff like a mannequin' instruction mode and wrapped me with a huge red ribbon and bow. Otherwis e I was totally naked. A card was attached to the ribbon. B ob instructed me to \"stay put,\" until Bing opened t he closet. As he closed the closet door on me, Bob said, \"You'll be okay.\" When Bing opened the closet to get a change of clot hes, there I was, totally naked, clad in a red ribb on and holding a greeting card. Bing started laughing and read a p ortion of the card out loud, \"a f--k me doll??!\" An d he laughed and laughed. He laughed so hard he bent over and he ld his stomach. Bing took off his tux and put his j acket over the back of the chair, laid the rest of his clothes on the seat and stood there wearing only his black top hat, shoes and socks. He had on the kind of socks that had black e lastic holding them up. He kept watching me, never taking his eyes off me while he was changing his clothes. He s eemed excited about this gift, but he also seemed a pprehensive. There were instructions on the card; I know, becaus e he laid it down and I read and retained it in my photographic memory. It said, \"This lovely young lady is yours f or the evening. You can't wear her down. She will p lease you in every way imaginable. You have only to reach out, take her left hand, squ eeze it and say, 'Come on honey, we're going home .' Oh, by the way, put a raincoat on her while you' re in transport, she didn't come with clothes.\" "},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"So Bing took my hand and led me out of the closet. He acted like I would break or wake up or something . He treated me like I wasn't real. He was very cautious at first. Bing and I got into a waiting limo and w ent to a penthouse apartment, \"to unwind,\" Bing said. It was his home away from home, a safe place, he said, li ke in the song \"up on the roof.\" He sang and danced a little and I sat on the bed and watched him. He sang some old song that I had never heard of and he looked ancient but alwa ys had a smile on his face. It seemed like he dance d out of nervousness, of not knowing quite what to do. He ne ver looked away from me for a minute. Then he came over, undid the tie on my raincoat and slowly undid the b uttons. I was barefoot and my feet were purple and cold. He pulled down the bed covers and I climbed in, and he began touching me, still with his own clothes on, when the phone rang. He put the receiver aside while the per son was talking on the other end. He laughed kind o f awkwardly and whispered to me, \"Just last minute instructions from Bob!\" Bing hung up and said, as if I could not hear or co mprehend, \"Bob said to rub here in circular motions to turn you on to HOT!\" He began rubbing circular motions aroun d my belly button, activating my sexual passion tou ch programs, and I began to do the programmed \"ohhhhhh \" moans and he got an erection after hearing that a nd pulled off his pants while he was still rubbing. It was as if he perceived me as a robot and was afraid of no t knowing how to work me ...afraid something might go wrong. I we nt into my dancing mode on the bed and took off the rest of his clothes. I did like Bob had instructed me, \"Tell hi m you're dreaming of a White Christmas and then win k.\" Once I had delivered that, I performed oral sex and rubbed him all over. Then I climbed on top of him and sat isfied him sexually. He'd had a drink in the limo that mixed w ith his cologne, and he smelled like alcohol. After we were through, he went right to sleep. I curled up beside him and fell asleep, too. Maybe all this was to ma ke sure he had that White Christmas he was dreaming of. Sometime l ater, the phone rang and woke us up. He got dressed , put me back into the raincoat and escorted me down the ele vator to a waiting limo. He stayed and I left in th e limo and was not taken back to Bob's but instead was taken to th e airport and flown home. The limo driver gave me c lothes to put on, and when I got on the airplane I slept the whol e flight home, like I was always programmed to do. You Can Sleep All the Way Home My programmed mother picked me up at LAX Airport and handed me a brown paper bag wit h my own clothes in it. I robotically went into the airport bathroom, c hanged into my own clothes, and went out to my moth er, who simply said, \"We're going home, honey. You can slee p all the way home.\" I slept all the way home in th e car. When we arrived at the house, I crawled into my own bed and buried all memory of this occasion, like all ot hers before it, deep into my subconscious mind, as my programming c ommanded. If it was nighttime when I returned, I was instruct ed to wash away all remembrances of the evening wit h a nighttime bath. The hypnotic command embedded in my programme d mind was, \"All that happened will go down the dra in with the water and will be forgotten and gone forev er.\" Then, I could go to sleep. If for some reason I didn't have time for a bath before I left Bob's to return to Wo odland Hills, I was instructed to take one at home before I went to bed and it had the same amnesiac effect. In those d ays, I felt very tired most of the time. Some days I had to go to high school the next day or, later on, to college, and woke up with my eyes burning and my make-up sti ll on from the night before. My mother always had trouble waki ng me in the mornings. There were times she or my f ather would pour water over my head in an attempt to wake me. On weekends, I was allowed to sleep until 11 o r 12 o'clock if I wanted. I could never figure out why I was always so exhausted. Now I know why. During my high school years, Bob said he was traini ng me to be a starlet, but he was really training m e to privately entertain his rich political and celebrity friends, or the troops. It was during these early years tha t I began being heavily accessed and programmed by the Council , for use with many influential men and women in po sitions of power. My use within government circles was guarant eed to be security proof due to the mind control I was under. They felt my programming kept the information I car ried from my own awareness and from access by other s who did not know the keys and codes to my system. But w hat those in government did not seem to know was th at the Council also had the ability to access me. They wer e secretly slipping in their own psychologically te sted and carefully researched messages for me to deliver to presidents, governors, senators, foreign leaders, e ntertainers, and many other people who were in positions of power or public influence. The Council studied people's profiles and knew exactly what the ir likes and dislikes were , their sexual preferences , and any other information that could be used to inf luence people in ways the person was never even awa re of. The"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Council pre-programmed me with instructions, all ba sed on careful prior research of the targeted perso n... what to wear, how to act, what type of sexual stance to tak e, specific words or phrases to say, and the best t ime to deliver them . The Council always worked up a complete strategy and never sent me to a targeted person unprepared . In these ways, they influenced government leaders t o act in their own favor, to pass or veto laws or b ills that benefited their corporate holdings , to bring into office those people who could be used as pawns , to influence judges and government agencies , to enlist large sums of monies, and to control peop le in all walks of life . My experience was that the Council was publicly nameless and unknown , and this anonymity is what made it possible for them to wield power over the masses . From my perspective, these individuals acting in the shadows actually dictated in a subversive and inconspicuous manner the direction our government took at the ti me . They were connected to powerful people like Bob Hope, th rough me as their secret liaison, though I was prog rammed not to be aware of it. They felt they had their identit ies and security locked up tight. \"Command those who are rich in this present world n ot to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God , who richly provides us with everything for our enjo yment.\" -- I Timothy 6:17 Chapter Eighteen Gerald Ford I called Ford, \"Henry,\" trying to joke with him so he wouldn't be so brutal but he usually was anyway, despite my attempts at humor. Ford began with me early, as he liked young girls . He was into fantasies and often liked for me to wear an eye mask. We had sex often, especially d uring the time Reagan was Governor of California. He liked violent sex tying me up, handcuffs, spankings, slap ping, and all that kind of S&M stuff . He enjoyed the whips and chains routine , and liked to tie me up with thick black leather s traps. He slapped me frequently. Often after he satisfied himself sexually with me, blood would dri p down my legs. It was so painful that I felt like I was not only splitting in my rectum or vagina, but the excruciat ing pain exploded up into my head and out my arms a nd fingertips. Gerald Ford required violent sex in order to orgasm . He joked about needing, \"the chain gig in order t o get off.\" His jokes were very crude . He was in politics a long time and often traveled in political circles. He was \"one of the good old boys\" and had major Mob connections . He wore his own gun in a shoulder holster and was afraid for me to remove it. \"I don't trust you with the gun,\" he said and he laughed. He was a short P resident and pretty hairy. While he was violent sexually he still was not as brutal as Ted Kennedy . Ford wore nice clothes, silk shorts and good quality su its, and he was very proud of them. For some reason, these mob guys were into expensive, quality clothes . I don't know why that was, but image was very important to them . There was lots of mob involvement when Nixon was Pr esident and Ford was Vice President, and it didn't stop when Nixon stepped down. Same mob involvement, just a fe w different players who were close friends of Jerry . Ford had more mob organizations behind him than Nixon did, so he had lots of people to give favors to when he was in the White House. He was very corrupt. He had to be in a wheelchair briefly for something. I don't know what happened but they managed to keep it hushed up . He had a bandage like he'd been shot or wounded o r operated on. I don't know exactly what happened, but I felt a little saf er when he was in the wheelchair. Unfortunately, he wasn't in it long enough to suit my needs. Ford didn't treat me like I was real . He often hurt me and was convinced that I was just a machine built for his pleasure. It was true that I was a no n-thinking slave that obeyed every command, but it did register within me when I was abused and treate d cruelly. During the time he was Vice President, I remember h im attending a ribbon-cutting ceremony. There was a beautiful white gazebo on a large lawn and he was there to cu t the yellow ribbon. Gerald Ford participated in ma ny of these grand openings. He was booked into these types of p ublic appearances in order to enhance his image as a 'good citizen.' But, in my opinion, he was not. Anyway, h e cut the ribbon with a large pair of scissors and then the crowd"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"clapped and cheered and reporters took his picture. Soon he got into a black limo, where I was waiting in the back, and was driven away. I was placed there to deliver a message to him from the Council. Then, I had to g et down on my knees in the back of the limo, unzip his pants a nd give him oral sex. He held onto a stun gun in hi s left hand the whole time. Just before he orgasmed I climbed on to p of him and moved around until he came, after whic h he activated the stun gun near my tailbone. He made a bunch of jokes about my name being the sa me as his daughter's. Like, \"You're not supposed to f--k kin,\" or \"That was great Susan Ford.\" Correcting him, a S ecret Service agent said, \"You're not suppose to ev er use her name, Sir.\" Ford smiled maliciously and said, \"It's my name, too, and I'll use it whenever I please.\" He never liked to be corrected or told what to do. Henry Kissinger got angry with him about that, also. Bob Hope played golf all over the world with his fr iend, \"Jerry Ford.\" That's what Bob called him. For d was a much better golfer than Bob, but Bob always shrugged it off and said, \"I just had a bad day today.\" He said that often. The Secret Service stayed close, but let them have thei r space and they usually played when there weren't other people on the course. When Ford was Vice President and Bob would talk about Nixon or other political agendas, when the talk got heavy Bob would look over to me, point to the cart, and say, \"Hey honey, take five,\" and I'd wait to be called back. Bob said they got very important work done on the course, sometimes more so than what wen t on during regular work routines. One time, \"Jerry,\" as Bob always called him, had on a Nixon watch. The round watch had a red, white, a nd blue band and a picture of Nixon in the middle . It was a caricature; not his real picture and For d said he looked \"kinda stupid.\" Calling Bob over, Jerry lifted his sleeve to show him the watch and I overheard him say, \" This asshole doesn't know the time of day ,\" and he took the watch off, threw in on the green an d stomped it with his foot . With a subtle nervous sort of laugh, Bob said, \"You're ver y serious about this I can see.\" Bob liked to play it cool with all the politicians, especially presidents. He had a rule about not making negative comments to one politician putting down another . He said, \"It is only diplomacy, which is essentia l in this business.\" I was required to have sex with Ford as Nixon's Vic e President and as President, but not ever as much as I did with Nixon or Reagan. I had sex with Ford as VP when he and Nixon were in different locations. Bush and Rea gan appeared at places together occasionally, but Nixon and Ford never did that I was aware of. Henry Kiss inger stayed connected to Ford, but at more of a distance after Nixon stepped down. Ford had connections all over t he place. When Nixon stepped down Ford was right there—grinni ng like a shark waiting for the spoils-- he and his mob buddies loved the opportunity to run the country fr om their perspective . I heard one of them say that at a private meeting. I was present at that meeting with directi ons to have sex with Ford and give him a Council me ssage after sex. I went along with Bob on golfing trips to cadd y for him at times when he golfed with different pr esidents. He jokingly called me, \"Katie the Caddy.\" Bob used me as a caddy so that no one could hear the sensitive nature of the conversations he had with prominent people. He ofte n assured his guest at the club that I was unable t o think, that I was retarded and that most anything. could be said in front of me and I wouldn't understand. He played me for a retarded person, at times, but o ther people knew I was really just a robot. Anyway, I had to hand Bob the correct golf club and I was instructed to a nticipate his every need. I knew which club he pref erred at each hole. I never was allowed to make a mistake and he would always wink at me just before he would swing. He whispered in my ear that it was just for luck. He s aid I was his good luck charm. He said that often t o me in Vegas, too. In Las Vegas he would want me to hold onto his arm while he shot the dice or played Baccarat. Bob 's attitude was much different after the game, if he lost. When he won he was in a great mood and would be happy a nd acted like he was real hot. I handed Jerry's clubs to him also, but when I did, I'd smile and say, \"Mr. Pres ident, Sir, how about this one?\" He occasionally smoked a small whi te tipped cigar on the green and had me hold it for him while he swung. Once while I was holding Jerry's cigar, B ob said to me, \"Hey be careful with those magic han ds of yours.\" Sex was always on his mind. When I handed the club to Bob he would say, \"I like that choice honey, let's give her a try.\" And if h e'd miss a shot or screw up he'd blame it on a bad choice of the cl ub or iron I selected. To cover himself, he'd say, \"Let's use a seven iron on that next shot, I think it'll be a be tter choice for the condition of this green.\" I als o got down, put the tees in the ground and set the ball up for Bob and his friends if they wanted or needed it, unless the y had their own caddy. The golf course in Palm Springs had a lot of sand on the course. Bob provided a visor for me to wear on the green and often slapped my bottom and said things l ike, \"I just like to remind myself what's up for la ter.\" Other"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"times he'd have me dressed in those little pleated short skirts with the little panties attached. Duri ng the course of the afternoon when Bob would stick his head under m y skirt, I'd just smile brainlessly and do a 'Tommy Smothers act' and everyone would always laugh. Or, he'd pull my skirt up and mess around with it, showing every one what he was finding, like the fact that the panties were se wn to the skirt and everyone thought it was so funn y. He used me like a sideshow act and told people, \"she's the but t of my jokes!\" Often after they finished the cours e, I had to give Ford oral sex or he'd have sex with me usually stan ding up backwards. This was extremely painful becau se of the thickness of his erection, and I could hardly walk later and I often bled afterwards; but he liked bes t to sit down and receive oral sex. It was always quite a mouthful wi th him and he'd ram it down my throat by pushing my head down real hard on him. Ford once said, \"This is the best part of the game.\" When he was finished with me my mouth often cracked and bled. Sometimes I did it in the back of a limo or in a side room at the golf course. Other times Bob would take Ford back to his house and tell him, \"En joy her.\" And, he'd leave me alone by the pool with Ford or in a bedroom. When Ford was finished, he'd just leave me abruptly. Then I'd just sit and stare straight ahe ad waiting for Bob to tell me what to do next. After I had children, Ford teased me that he may ha ve been the father of my child and he would ask me, \"How's junior?\" He was responsible for a lot of the mob vi olence that happened to me during the mid to late 7 0's. He always wanted to insure that I was 'contained,' so he even had his mob buddies come to my home to rough up my children and me. I was required to have sex with Gerald Ford on Thanksgiving Holidays at Big Bear and Big Sur. One holiday he jokingly said to Bob, \"This is one of th e things I am most thankful for,\" and they both lau ghed. Most of what I \"thought\" were our family vacations were act ually times I spent servicing men from all over. \"When you did it to the least of my brethren, you d id it to me.\" -- Matt. 25:40 Chapter Nineteen My Programmed Marriage – We’ve Only Just Begun In my \"conscious and public life\" I entered junior college at Pierce College in Woodland Hills, just a fter my High School graduation in February of 1969. 1 worked tow ard a degree in psychology. Craig's family felt it would be good for him to go away for college so he left for the University of Colorado at Boulder and lasted th ere for a year. His grades were poor and we ended up spending all o f our money on postage and plane fares to visit eac h other. After Craig's return to California, he began attend ing Valley State College, which is now California S tate University at Northridge, with his eye on an eventual degree i n dentistry. I worked a four-day week as a dental a ssistant for a Woodland Hills orthodontist named Michel N. Jacoby, D.D.S. Craig proposed marriage in August of 1970, offering me a ring he worked a couple of years to pay for. Our plans were to be married one year later on August 21, 197 1. Due to the mind control and cross-programming we were both under, we had no way of knowing that our marri age plans were not really our own. Following the se cret plan, my father offered two options. Option one was to ha ve a big wedding. Option two was to forgo the large wedding and, instead, take the money and use it on a lavish honeymoon in Hawaii. Being a romantic and somewhat traditional with my Christian upbringing, I chose t he large church wedding and reception. Craig and I were both surprised when my father informed us that he decide d to give us the Hawaiian honeymoon, as well. He ar ranged an appointment for us to meet with his travel agent an d the agent booked us a special package deal that w ould take us to several of the Hawaiian Islands. On August 21, 1971, Reverend McKelvey , who at that time had quit being a minister and wa s selling real estate, married us at the First Presbyterian Church of Encino . Two hundred and fifty people were in attendance. After I walked up the isle on my father's arm, the organist played the song, You'll Never Walk Alone, which wa s a subconscious message to me that I would always be c ontrolled. I cried during the entire ceremony but w hen asked, could offer little explanation as to why. My parent s went all out on a sit down dinner reception that was held poolside in our newly re-landscaped backyard in Woo dland Hills."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":" In order to keep our secret life concealed, Craig and I were also forced to participate in a separat e 'black wedding' that took place before our white wedding. I had to wear a long black dress and a black veil and Craig wore all black including a black shirt with his black suit. It too k place outdoors in a park late at night. Reverend McKelvey wore a black robe and married us in this ceremony, also. But my secret hidden life would not and did not go away. In fact, it continued to exist even on our honeymoon. Of cou rse, the reality of these secret events was kept ca refully away from my husband's and my conscious awareness by ver y powerful programming. One of the first nights we were in Hawaii, my newly wed husband took me to see Don Ho . Craig and I dressed for the evening and arrived in time for the dinner show . Don Ho appeared on stage, took the microphone in hand, and in his smooth modulated voice, sang Tiny Bubbles. When he was through he asked if there were any newlywed s in the audience. My handsome new husband proudly waved his hand in the air as he put his other arm around me and gave me a big hug. Don Ho congratulated us and requested the waiter bring a special bottle of champagne to our table. The bottle of champagne was a trigger for me to swi tch into another personality and Craig touched his watch as if adjusting it and that was to trigger and cue me. Fr om then on, I acted from a totally unconscious prog rammed state. The next thing I knew Craig took me backstage to Don Ho's dressing room where, initially, there was some kind of drug transaction. Next Don Ho took my hand and said to Craig, \"Don't run away so fast. You don't think I am going to let a pretty California thing like this slip thr ough my fingers.\" He looked directly at Craig. Crai g stepped back and Don Ho took me by the hand to another room. Craig f ollowed us. Don Ho ushered me inside, stuck his hea d back out the door and said to my husband, \" You don't mind sharing your beautiful young bride w ith me do you?\" My bridegroom looked to the ground and said, \"No, Sir. \" Craig looked nervous and agitated, but smiled. \"T hat's the way I like it - real easy.\" Don Ho said as he shut the door behind us. He told me he wanted me to struggle , so it would be like a rape. \"You would really like me to rape you though wouldn't you. You really enjoy being f----d. Or are you a virgin ...come for me to initiate?\" As directed, I ran around the room, escaping his advances until he grabbed me and unzipped the back of my dress. He slipped it of f, took off my sandals and said he would go real sl owly taking off the rest and that he had a particular liking fo r pretty bras and panties. Don Ho laid me on a large couch and began kissing m e and then he slapped me and kissed me again. He wa s really strange. First he was gentle and then the next minute violen t . He had been drinking and after he took my bra and panties off he said he needed to \"powder his face,\" and he snorted a line of cocaine . He came over and kneeled on one knee and started having sex with me. He said he loved tight women and he satisfied himself with me fairly quickly but never did take off his pants, just his shirt. When he was finished with me, I went back ou t to Craig and Do Ho stayed in the room. Craig took me back to our hotel room. The rest of our honeymoon we went to several other Hawaiian Islands including Maui. I was used sexually by other political people on other islands. When we returned from our \"honeymoon\" we moved into an apartment on Parthenia Avenue in Canoga Park, California. I continued working four days a week fo r Dr. Jacoby and Craig continued his studies as a pre-med major to become a dentist. Sliced into my 'expanded ' duties as dental assistant, were 'special assignm ents' that began when a suited man, posing as a drug company salesma n, delivered tiny implants that I was programmed to cement into the braces of certain 'select' young patients. Most often, they were beautiful young girls. One d ay, as another dental assistant and I were busily cementing a band on a particularly be autiful 10 year old girl , whose father was an affluent, prominent USC dental professional in the community , I was repulsed when I ran my dental instrument around her tooth and came up with a pubic hair . My assistant and I looked at each other in horror and, although I was under mind control, the obvious connections wer e made. In 1973, Craig and I moved to Agoura Hills and my p arents gave us a down payment to buy a condominium on Oakpath Drive. It wasn't long until my parents sold their home in Woodland Hills and moved down the st reet from us. They were always close by. I was still accessed and used with Nixon, Reagan, Kissinger, Bob Hope a nd others, as well as in various experimental projects (includ ing dental implant experimentation) and filmed in p orn in many locations in California, especially Studio City and Bel Aire. During his junior year at Cal State Nort hridge, Craig applied to 20 dental schools around the nation and was rejected at every one of them because his grade s weren't high enough to qualify him for entrance. But my fat her saved the day by calling his rich Uncle Charlie , whom he supposedly hadn't seen or spoken to in over 25 year s, to ask him humbly for the favor of helping his s on-in-law into USC Dental School . Soon after, my father's \"Uncle\" arranged for Crai g's acceptance to USC Dental School. "},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Charles Lilley Horn , wasn't really my father's uncle but instead a cousi n . He was owner of Federal Cartridge Corporation (munitions manufacturer), which later became a major subsidiary of the Olin Foundation, Inc . During the 1960's, as President of the Olin Foundat ion (a charitable trust established by F. W. Olin, founder of the Olin Corporation), Uncle Charlie contributed sizeable donations to USC and had connections to the school . More on all of this in a later chapter. Upon acceptance to dental school, Craig quit Cal State Northridge, before obtaining his BS degree, and worked full time until he entere d USC School of Dentistry. \"But everything exposed by the light becomes visibl e, for it is light that makes everything visible.\" -- Ephesians 5:13-14 \"Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger ...be ki nd and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.\" -- Ephesians 4:31-32 Chapter Twenty Jimmy Carter Evidently Jimmy Carter was too directed by his Christian belief system an d too connected to his wife to ever stray. It was my experience that if he was guilty of any s exual indiscretions, he did only lust in his heart. I never had sex with Jimmy Carter . He did, however, listen and respond to messages del ivered through me from the Council . He had a very hungry ear and listened carefully and re sponded helpfully to all but a few requests from th em. He even bit on a bunch of Henry's messages, delivered throu gh me. By then Carter thought I was only Council, he didn't know I was connected to Henry Kissinger and Henry loved that he was \"puppeting a democrat \" and \" one that didn't believe in adultery but would take top secre t information from a whore and run the country from it .\" Henry thought it was the best laugh ever. But he always r an parallel and complementary with the Council. The y were his boss and he took many orders from them politically, but he could also place in his own input. \"But now the Lord who created you ...says: Don't be afraid, for I have ransomed you; I have ca lled you by name; you are mine. When you go through deep waters and great trouble, I will be with you. When you go through rivers of difficulty, you will not drown! When you walk though the fire of oppression, you wi ll not be burned up - the flames will not consume y ou. For I am the Lord your God, your Savior...\" -- Isaiah 43:1-3 Chapter Twenty-one The Hollywood Connection Michael Jackson Michael Jackson was just a little boy of four or five when I accomp anied Bob Hope to a place where they were filming up-and-coming talent for television . Bob told me he supported and sponsored the Jacksons , getting them a professional foot in the door. Their father brought the boys in and I remembered seeing them taken int o a side room where bright lights were on. They all had to drop their pants and before their p erformance a big man raped each one of them in a lineup . Then they were taken to a different room and dresse d in little suits and sent onto the stage to"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"perform . Due to the mind control I was under, I'm not sure exactly where we were, but feel that it was the early days of the Ed Sullivan Show . I watched as Bob, dressed in a grey pinstripe sui t and bow tie, with white shoes, shook hands with Ed; and then the Jackson boys went on. They were made into a sensation and famous, on purp ose , so that they could be used in the future to influence large audiences . Bob and his connections knew that all they needed was some talent, make-up, costumes, lights, glitter and lots of publicity . He said publicity was the most important ingredient. I was just a teenager and Bob said that he wanted m e to be present so I could learn the ropes to being a \"starlet.\" He wanted me to see how it was done and feel comfortab le around the stage. I think he just said that as a cover to other people to hide the real reason I was with him - for his and others sexual pleasure. Bob explained to m e how important clothes are to one with a public image to uphold. I had on a short, small, tight-fitting, lo w-cut, yellow, sheath dress. I did as I was told and wore it along with the gold high heels I was provided. Bob was o ften the connection for new entertainment. The Council used his connections for their own interest and got 'key' entertainers in place for future use . Many were robots like me . I saw many of them get hurt. I never saw Bob get hurt though. The Jacksons were hurt; I was witness to their abuse . That first time when they performed, Bob got them onto the show and then we left in the limo and watched from the television inside. He told the driver to drive around until the show was over. Then Bob told me , \" See how easy it is to be a star?\" And he laughed and pushed my head into his lap for oral sex. I think most would agree that the inherent love that is part of Michael Jackson's so ul essence shines through for the world to see. In spite of the programming themes in some of the s ongs he sings , as I was recovering I often held onto the words he sang, the lyrics rem inding me, \"You are not alone,\" when I felt so very alone. To Michael, I extend a hand and say you also are not a lone. Now there is a way out of this insanity. Neil Diamond and Others Publicly, Neil Diamond and Bob golfed together in the Springs. That's how I got connected to him. As a teenager, I was programmed to serve Neil Diamond in different c apacities for many years. He was not violent like some of the others, but he didn't have any morals . One day when I was a young teenager, Neil walked though the breezeway into our backyard to the pool where I was tanning i n my bikini. My father got very angry and told him, \"Get the hell out of here!\" Neil replied, \"Take it easy, Pops. No one knows I'm here. Just Relax.\" But he did leave after he kissed me on the cheek and ran his hands though my hair. H e said he just needed to see me for \"inspiration\" a nd then he left. Neil always said I was his inspiration and af ter we'd have sex I'd whisper programmed phrases in his ear to incorporate into his songs or phrases for program l ock-in or, as our controllers said , \" to move the targeted generation up another notch .\" When I was with Neil I felt merged with him. I didn 't know who I was, where I ended and he began. I wa s programmed to magnify his essence so he could feel and see more of who he was. I was used often to con tain Neil, to bring him back to himself and bring his \"self\" b ack to him when he felt he gave it all away to crow ds and audiences. Over time I witnessed this being a probl em for a lot of programmed stars. I was sent to do this service for other celeb's, both male and female, who needed to bounce off another person in order to maintain thei r programmed \"selves.\" They got lost at times and I w as programmed to help them. I suntanned with him in the nude and like a protect ive Jewish mother, he always made sure I had lots o f suntan lotion on, especially in crucial spots so I wouldn' t burn. He didn't have neighbors and his home was l ocated up on a hill in Malibu or the Santa Monica Mountains, so it was very secluded. They could have tricked me in r egard to the location of his house, but I know I had to drive th rough the canyon to get there. He was building a ne w home and when the deck was stable enough to hold us we had s ex outside. As we looked upward toward the night sk y, he named all the stars on my list \"to do.\" The list wa s lettered not numbered, such as, \"(A) Barbra: Tues day and Thursday 3:30 p.m. (B) Carlo Sangucci: 7:00 p.m.... \" and he continued inputting my schedule for the we ek. He gave me instructions to keep my schedule organized. If h e ever missed me for the week, I couldn't function because I hadn't received my local assignments. For this reas on, Neil and I were very regular with each other. I n my late teens, I visited with him nearly every week. And, when I was with him I delivered lyrical words or ph rases for songs to him after sex . When we were in our programmed \"cozy\" state, he'd say, \"give me sugar,\" and I'd unload all I had been given into him and later it would show u p over and over in his songs. Privately, he would a ttribute it only"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"to my being his undying inspiration. I was used wit h Neil like I was with Elvis, which leads me to bel ieve that Neil is also programmed. Neil played the piano and sang to practice while we aring sweatpants and no shirt. He also had a room w here the whole entire wall was mirrored. He stood and looked into the mirror and sang to himself to rehearse. I n some ways he reminded me of Elvis. I was never allowed to int errupt while he was playing. But when he was throug h, he had me do everything for him, including a massage or se x, manicure and pedicure - even if he'd just had on e somewhere else. He could never get enough touching and attent ion. I had a whole grouping of personalities locate d beneath 'tiger sex programming,' seven in all, devoted to h im and he would say, \"I have seven so I can get to heaven and you darlin' take me to heaven.\" Neil programmed in, \"Wi ne will take you to the place of love.\" He had a ro om with fountains, Buddhas, and ferns where he meditated. H is place of \"perfect peace,\" he called it. He creat ed devotion in the personalities within me by programming into me the love and goodness of Jesus, His pure love, all into my heart chakra so that the feelings of devotion would be di rected toward him. Pornography was often filmed at his estate . Bob sent people from his parties that were sexual ly wild to Neil's for filming in pornography. It didn't matter if they we re only children. Neil's porn business was so large that it kept a large number of Malibu, Pacific Palisades, Ventura, Calabasas, and Agoura Hills slaves very busy. Whole programmed families were used . 'Sex with families' videos were popular in the 80 's among a certain group and Neil seemed totally fascinated, watching families togeth er. He loved bodies. He said he was a connoisseur o f the human body as an art form. That's why he said he liked to film the most beautiful act on earth, the love act , when people were as intimate as they could get. He said that children should be allowed to openly e njoy the pleasures of sex . He asked, \"Why should they have to wait to enjoy these natural pleasures?\" I couldn't think to answer. He liked to see their physical characteristics and he liked to watc h them, as he called it, \"make love, family-style .\" Other times when he was in a different sort of mood, he would r efer to the pornography as, \"getting it on, family- style.\" Unfortunately and sorrowfully, I remembered being p rogrammed to drive children to Neil's. Once we arri ved I walked into the house like I owned it. I knew where the hidden key was and ushered everyone in and got them settled. The rule at Neil's house in the hills was that you had to check your clothes and shoes at the door. None were allowed, or else you couldn't enter, \"the Sanctuary ,\" as he called it. Neil often came out in his blac k silk robe and black slippers to meet his, \"guests,\" he called the m. He looked them over and if they were particularl y appealing to him, he would want to have sex with one or more aft er the filming. Neil was what Henry Kissinger calle d \"versatile,\" which meant he liked sex with everythi ng. I will spare you the details but he relieved hi mself sexually, often, as he felt it made him powerful and continua lly virile. That was very important to him. Neil sa id he loved the beauty and amount of innocence that was present whe n a group of blonde neighborhood children were toge ther. They were filmed often. Neil also filmed bestiality porn . He gave the kids cocaine and filmed it in the house or somewhere on the grounds. Sometimes the 4-H kids br ought their animals, and they filmed the kids havin g sex with each other and the animals. We were all just viewed as worker bees and mindless ly did whatever we were told. When we left to go home, I once again entered a pro grammed mind state, by traveling \"The Highway to He aven,\" which I was told was Kanan Road. I was given the hy pnotic command to \"remember to forget,\" whenever I saw many signs and signals along the canyon roads, in t heir attempt to keep memory of these events hidden from my conscious mind. At other times, if I arrived before Neil, I was tol d to wait and so I sat down on his white sofa. Obed iently, I waited, looking straight ahead or out the window to the dis tant view. Then I heard the chopper and on one occa sion he came walking into the house wearing a tan suit and sungl asses. One time he even wore those guru sandals wit h his suit. Then I helped him relax and he would say programmed phrases to me like, \"Honey, you're ageless, timele ss, and all mine baby, all mine. You are my pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. All mine, devoted only to me.\" I got him anything he wanted or needed no matter what it was, and I was programmed to love doing it. Some nights I was assigned to go to parties with hi m where we'd, \"hob knob with the rich and famous,\" he'd say, as he held out his arm for me to hold onto. We didn't stay too long at parties because he would want to h ave a private party for two at home. Some evenings we were helico ptered to his home in the hills. He wanted and dema nded my full attention. He never wanted to enter the realit y that I had my own boyfriend or husband. He wanted me to think of him as my man, my only man. But, he had sex with lots of people in front of me. He always wanted me to stay right in the room during the filming of porn as wel l as later when he had sex with whoever was filmed. He would"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"flip out and act like an emotionally temperamental boy at times. Regardless of his actions, I was prog rammed to be totally devoted and I catered to his demands exclus ively. Neil Diamond was a Council \"treasure \" and they kept him well taken care of . I attended concerts of his to shore him up when he said he wanted and needed me to be t here. I got up from my ticketed seat next to my you ng husband and told him I was going to the restroom du ring the intermission. Instead I slid backstage wit h Neil, who was all sweaty, shaking and needing to share the po werful high he was on. He said that all the energy people focused onto him was totally overwhelming him and h e said he needed me to ground him out so he could g o back on stage. That meant sex and then, as programmed, I told him I loved him and that he was the very best and to go out and give them all that he had. I told him if he gave all of himself to the audience who loved him, that they would shower it all back to him. He was always afraid tha t when he gave so much at performances that he woul d become depleted but I helped him reframe that belief, so h e went back out empowered, not consumed. Then he wo uld snort a couple of lines of cocaine and go back out to the screaming fans, and I returned to my seat next to Craig. Craig and I attended another of his concerts at the Universal Amphitheater. Neil told me to drink a ch ampagne cocktail, which at times was against the rules, but for the night he was my master. He said he wanted me to catch up to him (he was on a drug high), but even after I'd had a drink I always came into focus for Neil and w as instructed to mirror back to him what my controllers wanted him t o be, do, say and feel. Lots of the words to his so ngs were program lock-ins for me ...like Starlight, Starflig ht, and Turn on Your Heartlight (ET). I was program med to listen to his music to keep my programming and memories lo cked away from my conscious mind. Neil used to say he was singing to me while he was on stage. That was pretty powerful for me to contai n, while I sat next to my husband during the concert. In my consci ous awareness I had no idea I was doing anything ot her than attending Neil's concert; but even as I sat in a co nscious state of unawareness, the underlying feelin gs were powerful as I held my connection to Neil. We had an agreement that he would sing it all to me, send ev erything he had to me, and I would say, \"And I will be here col lecting all of you and I will bring it back to you filled with more love and more caring than you could ever imagine!\" That made him smile. Then at intermission or after the concert, I'd go and give it all back to him to fill him back up. He pretended like he was taking it and then he dressed and went out with other people. Neil was hustled into a limo and was gone, and so were those parts of me t hat were programmed to go to sleep inside of me until they s aw Neil again. Then Craig would come and take me ho me. I also attended his Hot August Nights concert at th e Greek Theatre in 1972. Neil said he liked to be s howered with love, and in response I was always soft and nurturi ng and loving with him. I catered to him exclusivel y while I was with him. He loved to trace his finger around my be lly button to bring out \"Jeanie.\" I was still having sex and caring for Neil, even while I was in therapy in 1988 . I went to therapy in Westwood and then swung home , down Pacific Coast Highway to meet Neil somewhere or at his home , have sex, and then I'd drive back to Agoura to my home, with \"fresh fish\" I bought for my family at the Mal ibu Fish Store. Bob laughed when he said it would b e a good cover. Bob saw the world through a completely sexua l orientation. Stars had trouble getting \"secured\" sex with people. They couldn't trust that people weren't com ing on to them to manipulate or hurt them, and sinc e they were famous they couldn't risk losing their public reput ation. So, slaves were provided to them. And Bob pr ovided me to everyone he could, knowing the value of connections to powerful people. He laughed and said, \"It's all right, she's broadening herself.\" Word seemed to spread like wildfire to stars about the sex slave service. They loved it just like the politicians did, since they thought they could let their hair down a nd not have to worry because many were told I was a robot that couldn't ever divulge their secrets. With individua ls not privy to the top-secret mind control informa tion, Bob explained, \"She's beautiful and highly sexual, but she's mentally slow and can't think. She doesn't ha ve the ability to remember. She's been like this since birth, but..., \" Bob elucidated, \"...what she lacks upstairs she g reatly makes up for downstairs,\" and he'd smile slyly, \"if you know what I mean.\" Many people never knew that I was a robot, under to tal mind control. They just thought I was slow or d eaf and dumb. That was another tactic Bob used. He had diff erent explanations for different people, but for Ne il Diamond, personalities were created within me who talked, li stened, loved and cared for Neil. Bob often called other men, \"Son.\" I overheard him say, \"Listen son, she'll ple ase you and ease you and not spill the beans. She c an't think to! But that won't hurt, it will only enhance your plea sure. Try it and see. I think you'll like it!\" Bob maximized my usage by sending me to many, many stars and politic ians over the years. He sent me to Quincy Jones, Bu rt"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Reynolds, Eddie Murphy, and others. Many of them di dn't want to risk too much exposure with strangers for various and sundry reasons; they didn't want to bec ome too attached emotionally, didn't want to risk t he security of knowing someone too long where a person could find out too much and hurt them in different ways, or th ere were other reasons unique to individual celebrities. Mickey Rooney In yesteryears, I was taken to show openings or gal as in Hollywood, because Mickey would want me to be there, usually disguised. Later on after I had children, m y daughter Kelly would be waiting inside the limo t o give him oral sex. Mickey wanted me there to watch. Mickey always liked to have tons of women, as many as he c ould amass, flanked by his side . I overheard him say to Bob that it was good for h is image. Bob replied, \"Anytime it can be arranged for you to use any of my girls, I'd be delighted.\" And that was arranged, over and over again. Bob mad e sure Kelly was trained in many of the same ways h e trained me. We went to the Playboy Club for Kelly to have b unny lessons. I was dressed in a long black velvet gown with diamonds and Kelly had on a long red velvet gown wi th her hair done up and make-up. She was around 10 years old. All this to insure Bob's 'little filly' was prepare d for use with whomever he decided to share her wit h. There were times Mickey Rooney would rendezvous with my f amily at a small exclusive restaurant in Agoura Hil ls. When the cues were given, Kelly would get up to go to the restroom and Mickey Rooney took over, later sexually pleasuring himself with our beautiful little daught er. He had a house near the area. I am not sure whe re exactly, but his house had a solarium with an indoor pool and he liked to have a lot of naked women around the pool . He was absolutely disgusting , but he really liked Kelly a lot. Jane Fonda I believe Jane Fonda was under programming , also. She was part of the experiment on how to achieve \"e ternal youth ,\" while participating to further the cause in behi nd-the scenes political arenas. I occasionally passed Council messages to her at her Beverly Hills Fitness Center . They had a control group within the project to se e if women would stay youthful and cease to age with just mind programming, or if exercise needed to be combined with the programming. They had a control group participating like Jane with the same eternal youth program, yet not exercising extensively to see which method prolonge d longevity. In case you are interested, they found exercise to be a necessary component for successful anti-aging . James Taylor My husband took me to James' concerts; we went ofte n when he was in town. During one concert I had two glasses of wine. My instructions were that after I drank th em I was to go to the restroom and then go to the b ackstage door, and knock two times. When the door opened, I said, \"Bob Hope sent me. Anybody interested? Anybody want any body?\" \"Hell yes!\" a man in a casual shirt said, pu lling me in the door. \"James will need a little at the break. A little pick-me-upper for his pecker. You just sit down her e little lady and get yourself HOT. No,\" he laughed , \"cool your wheels or is that heels? Just relax your c--t until it's time for the hunt. James is almost finished w ith the set.\" He pretended he was yelling to James in a high voice, \"James, she's here, the one you hold near and dear, the c--t from Bob the Boss man.\" Then he looked over to me and sa id, \"Just a few moments and you'll be on the Highwa y to Heaven with James ...little Jimmy.\" James stumbled off stage all sweaty and took my han d. I was feeling shy and he said, \"Follow me on the Highway to Heaven. You are in for the ride of the night, as you ride my jewel to heaven. It will be out of thi s world, otherworldly, outta' sight!\" He took me into a room and laid me on a couch chair and said, \"Look into the air, don't beware, your chicken is cookin,' you're good lookin ,' but aren't aware.\" He pushed my head over to the side real hard and continued, \"Show me your wares.\" So I took off my clothes and dropped them to the floor. He t old me to sit and spread 'em so I did and he dropped his loos e fitting off white cotton trousers on the floor. W hile he held tightly to the back of my head, he relieved himself in my mouth. \"Oh, oh,\" he screamed, \"that was gooo oood. Swallow that please and then you can be excused.\" H e swished on by, kind of dancy like and said, \"That oughtta' propel me into the second half with gusto!\" "},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"He walked out, closed the door and I sat there like a robot until another guy came in and raped me on the couch. He said, \"James saved your c--t for me this time.\" He stood over me and when he orgasmed he screamed, \"I feel like a cock-a-doodle-do!\" he said crowing like a rooster. When he was through with me he said, \"Okay, its clo thes time!\" then he delivered a hypnotic hand command. I got up and pulled my clothes on and he led me out to the side door where Craig was standing at the door waiting for me . Craig took me by the hand, and I felt like a litt le girl going back to my seat where I sat robotically until the c oncert was finished. Over the years I was programmed to listen repeatedl y to James Taylor's songs while some of the word phrases \"re- minded\" me to, \"...leave your mind behind, Mexico.. .\" and \"...you can run but you cannot hide, this is widely known ....\" Barbra Streisand Barbra Streisand was used in the same way as other Hollywood celebri ties before and after her . Through my personal experience with Barbra Streisand, I believe she is under the control of many of the s ame persons I was . She was pre-programmed to deliver messages she couldn't even have known she was passing on to millions of people. She sang her songs and was given carefully selected , pre-chosen words that would serve to lock in or o pen up certain programming in other mind control victims. My own programming was laced with many of her songs . Victims of mind control hear the lyrics of a song a nd take the phrases that match their programming li terally. The words they hear tie into subconscious memory of pas t traumatic experiences intended to keep them helpl essly and hopelessly under mind control. Barbra sang a song entitled My Pa which I was told represented my feelings toward my father and the wo rds were powerfully connected to my emotional state, creatin g a feeling of love and safety with my father, when in fact he was torturing me endlessly, nearly every day. The l yrics stated, \"My pa can light my room at night wit h just his being there, and make a fearful dream all right by grinning ear to ear...\" etc. Her song, \"I'm in a Ne w York State of mind, \" was tied to programming to orient me to eve nts and people I was used with in New York in order to keep that reality separate from my conscious mind. Many of the lyrics from her song Memories, served as a h ypnotic command to my subconscious mind, in order to 're-mi nd' me that, \"Memories may be beautiful and yet wha t's too painful to remember, we simply choose to forget.\" A nother of her songs, Send in the Clowns, reminded m e and can remind other survivors of the abuse they endured as children in circus or amusement park settings wher e clowns were used as perpetrators. And, then there's her re ndition of Over the Rainbow, which taps into Wizard of Oz programming themes. As a teenager my cassette tapes and, as I grew olde r, my CD's of Barbra's songs, were well worn from e ndless listening, as the lyrics to her songs, coupled with my already intact program commands, continued to c reate my reality, whatever my controllers wanted it to be. Up until recently, my mother repeatedly listened to Barbra Steisand's songs . As a child I often had trouble getting my mother' s attention because when she listened to the songs she became so fixated on the music that she w as very far off somewhere in a programmed reality c reated by our controllers. She seemed very happy, almost euph oric. I've witnessed other survivors cling desperat ely to their Walkman delivering their programmed commands, while I'm trying to talk with them, due to their attempt to, as they've experienced, keep themselves \"safe\" by rein forcing their program \"to forget.\" When Barbra performed, which was rare, she was delivering a pe rfectly planned and orchestrated set of cryptic instructions to many of the people in attendance . She reached a wider audience, as mind-controlled victims bought the cassette tape or video of the performance and l istened to it over and over and over again. Certain groups of mind controlled people, like my mother and myself, were targeted for listening to her. Per program, we list ened to her songs addictively and compulsively while following the command to reprogram ourselves by locking down the security of our own programming. Of course, Barbra herself is a victim and, from my observation, I am sure has no awareness that she is doing anything other than per forming. Barbra Streisand has extremely large breasts for he r small body size. I've seen her naked at Bob Hope's parties and at other places . I was even involved in group sexual orgies where sh e was participating . And at other times, I was targeted to have sex with her one-on-one in order t o deliver messages to her to keep her programming g oing or to instruct her on what to say at certain times. She is a mind-controlled robot . She did lots of cocaine at parties . She"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"liked sex with women, and usually requested it. I w as sent to her often. My husband frequently took me out for dinner in Malibu when there was an alternate agenda to be accomplished. One night after such a dinner he drove me up a canyon road in his Datsun 280Z. He stopped alo ng the road and we sat in the dark without saying a nything until a black sedan pulled up next to the car. I go t out and climbed into the back seat of the sedan. Two men in the front seat were dressed in dark expensive suits and the man in the passenger side had a gold pinky rin g. They continued up a winding road to a house in the canyo n and when we arrived they opened the door of the h ouse with a key and went in. Barbra Streisand was robotically sitting on the couch and I was told to sit down next to her and link up by holding her hands . So I took her hands and then the man said, \"Deliver the words .\" So I did. After I delivered the message, they used the stun gun on us both . Barbra laid face down on the couch, really out of it, with her hand hanging down over the side. Her face was v ery pale and she looked asleep. The man took me by the arm and pushed me toward the door and we left. Craig, s till waiting in the Z, flashed his headlights and t hey stopped the sedan, transferred me back to my husband and we wen t home. In September of 1986, Barbra sent out invitations t o a special fundraising concert to be given at her home 'under the stars,' in Malibu. My husband received our invitati on at his dental office and said we should go, but I remember saying to him, \"It's $5,000 a ticket, what are you thinking of?\" I was in school as well as therapy by this time, and spending $10,000 was a huge chunk out of the resour ces that I needed to spend on my healing and educat ion . I was more interested in my recovery than one night of Barbra Streisand in concert . My husband replied, \"Well, it would be a great memory.\" Prior to this episode, Craig ha d never displayed any special attraction to Barbra Streisand or her music. Later when she and I were both switched into a \"programmed state of mind,\" she told me she was upset that I didn't buy a ticket to come to see her in co ncert at her home. Ironically, I ended up being at her concert in Mali bu anyway to have sex with and target some military guy with a bunch of stars on his uniform and later after the c oncert, Barbra. I was incognito and wore my lace of f-the-shoulder dress that I had previously worn for our family por traits. It was a $400 dress my husband bought me. I had to be at different places afterwards to help her relax and u nwind, which usually ended up in sex. I had been in structed to say specific words to relax her. A therapist was there at other times to help. When they could sell a cert ain number of very expensive tickets to her concert in the area o f her home, they proved the results of a mind contr ol project experiment to see if that targeted area was suffici ently under mind control. Checkmate! When it sold out they felt they had won because they sent the invitations to p eople that would be the hardest to control (the mos t challenging) and when it sold out they knew they had \"cracked th e code .\" Their victory was only temporary. As I now know, th ey were mistaken, for, I believe The City of Angels (Los Angeles) is spiritually destined to wake up to clai m its name to fame! No one could tell there had eve n been a mind control experiment that concluded with Barbara's Ma libu performance. This was one way the controllers made large sums of money, all carefully concealed in such \"cha rity fundraisers,\" which were then meticulously fun neled into covert accounts. And, they further locked victims i n, not only with the concert but with the video tha t was made of the concert. During her Malibu, One Voice performan ce, Barbra delivered one program-laced song lyric a fter another. First she sang “Send In the Clowns.” Then she announced that in her research she came across one of the finest songs ever written, and the lyrics felt so r elevant she decided to sing it and dedicated it to the woman who first sang it. That song was Over the Rainbow, and encompasses these lyrics: \"When all the world is a hopeless jumble and the ra indrops tumble all around, heaven opens a magic lan e. When all the clouds darken up the skyway, there's a rainbow highway to be found, leading from your windowpane to a place behind the sun, just a step b eyond the rain. Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high, there's a land that I've heard of once in a l ullaby. Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue. And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true. Someday I'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are far behind me. Where troubles melt like lemon drops way above the chimney-tops, that's wher e you'll find me. Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebir ds fly. Birds fly over the rainbow, why then, oh, w hy can't I. If all those little bluebirds fly beyond t he rainbow, why oh why, can't I?\" To further explain the significance of these word p hrases for mind control victims: \"...heaven opens a magic lane,\" was for me a hypnotic induction for mind control. \" ...there's a rainbow highway to be found, leading f rom your windowpane to a place behind the sun, just a step b eyond...\" for me was a program command to switch to the Highway to Heaven, which was a dissociative state i n which I went over the rainbow to a subconscious p lace in my mind where I was commanded not to associate what ha ppened there with my everyday, conscious reality."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" In Barbra's duet with Andy Gibb , they sang the song Guilty and the words that powe rfully affected me and could effect other ritual abuse/mind control survivors ar e: Gibb quickly enters the stage from behind singin g, \"there's danger in the dark,\" which for me was a subconsciou s reminder of trauma that occurs in the dark. Over the years, the word 'dark' was linked in my subconscious mind to ritual terrors and horrors, a reminder that comm anded me to remember to forget, or else. Further lyrics were: \"...Shadows fallin' baby, we stand alone...\" - vict ims are often told they will be left to stand all a lone, that no one outside 'the network' will believe or help them, or even want to be around them. \"...Nothing to be guilty for...\" - a release for th e endless ways many are forced to participate in th e evil deeds, puppeted and dictated by our controllers. \"...Eyes can see, that we got a highway to the sky. ..\" - victims are told they are always watched, by the 'eye in the sky' and in other ways by their controllers. Eyes a re often a common theme in the art/journal work of victims in recovery. These three small words, \"eyes can see... \" have powerful meaning, sneaking through a subcons cious doorway into the mind of a victim of mind control i n order to remind them to watch carefully that they stay in line. \"...that we got a highway to the sky...\" - can be a hypnotic induction to dissociate in order to recei ve program. \"...how can I win? Where will The tomorrow?\" -words of despair, defeat. The powerful ending to the due t is: \"and we got nothing ...and we got nothing, and we got no thing...\" Let me tell you Barry and Barbra, and all of the other beautiful people locked under the bondage of mind c ontrol: that is a lie, a lie our controllers told a ll of us. The truth is that we have everything. We are rich, starting with our spiritual heritage. The One that created us is powerfully working within to set you free from thos e who for years have benefited, by allowing you to soar, sharing your talents with others as they controlled and man ipulated you for their own benefit, through mind co ntrol - through the control of your mind and mine. I wasn't famous, so when I broke free I wasn't as large a t hreat as you are and will be. I was small potatoes to my control lers. But to God I was important, as all His childr en are, and He has commissioned me to dedicate my life to seeing t o it that you, some of the most talented human bein gs on this planet, are freed. This is His wish because He has assured me that you have at the center of your bein g, love, and that when you can know the magnitude of issues we f ace at this time, that you will stand and reach you r hand down to your fellow brothers and sisters, to help them. At this time I am lending my hand, via Him, to you in hopes that some of you may be freed in order to reach your hands out to the masses. It is our last hope and we are running out of time. God has placed a great ma gnitude of love in my heart for you and my children, and I love all of you more than life itself, because indeed in sh aring this information it would seem that I am putting my life at risk. But the Master Himself has assured me saf e passage, as I go for help for all of you. And this manuscript i s my attempt to \"go for help,\" for you. I also am a ware that those of you who are programmed will not be able, like oi l reacting to water, to read or comprehend what I h ave written. But I hope others will intercede for you in order t hat you can be delivered from the bondage you have been held captive by. I love you, as individuals and for the beautiful he avenly creative talents you possess, but not as imm ensely as God does . He wants your freedom, He wants your release and He won't rest until you are all free of this evil for ce , one that at this time you are unable to be aware of. As the concert proceeded, Barbra said, \"I am going to light this candle in memory of all those wise and good men who se lives were senselessly and violently snuffed out before their time: Lincoln, Ghandi, Martin Luther King, John Kennedy, Anwar Sadat, Olaf Palmer , men of peace and vision, voices the world so desperately needs n ow – father figures. I think we've all lost someone whose guidance and wisdom we miss in times of fear and co nfusion, and this is for them.\" After which she san g: \"May the light of this flickering candle, illuminate the nig ht the way your spirit illuminates my soul.\" Sounds to me like bits and pieces of reminders of people I watched killed over the years. "},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Next in her backyard concert, Barbra sang Pa Pa, wh ere the lyrics say, \"Pa Pa can you hear me? ...Look ing at the skies I seem to see a million eyes which ones are y ours?\" Again, there is the \"eyes watching you\" them e. Next was, of course, Memories, with the lyrics reminding our subconscious minds: \"Memories like the corners of m y mind, misty water-colored memories like the way we were. Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind, sm iles we gave to one another for the way we were. Can it be that it was all so simple then or has time rewritten eve ry line, if we had the chance to do it all again, tell me would we , could we? Memories may be beautiful and yet, what 's too painful to remember we simply choose to forget. For it's the laughter we remember, whenever we remembe r the way we were.\" At the end of her concert, in a patriotic quest, Ba rbra sang America the Beautiful and invited the aud ience to join with her in song. During those years, (although at the time I was consciously unaware of my involvemen t) her therapist and I were often in charge of keeping Bar bra stable and balanced. The therapist worked with her psychological state and I worked on her body, doing massage therapy, accupressure, polarity therapy, e tc. All this was done to keep Barbra in shape and in line. She w as fragile and needed a lot to keep her going. I was called in often to shore Barbra up, especiall y in between times when she was out of relationship or having problems with her male friends. Later in her career , she had trouble even having sex with men. When sh e was alone, she would get scared at night and need someone. As programmed, I'd go over after my children were take n care of or when our maid was there, at which time I was fre e to go at anytime. I held Barbra and did whatever she seemed to need to get her stabilized. We walked on the bea ch a lot, especially after she bought the home away from the Colony nest (the grouping of homes she owned) and p eople that knew her. She bought a place just a few blocks down the street. It was very clever because if peop le thought they saw her on the beach, they could as sume she was at home, but then she'd disappear into the anonymou s home that was purchased in another name to give h er the privacy she needed. Then her therapist and I could go to her there unnoticed. She wanted privacy even from her maids, and would arrange for her therapist and I to be with her. If she didn't call on the car phone a nd tell me, she would walk to the new house and call me from her be droom. I was instructed to go to the front gate and from a call box tell the maid a coded message to give to her. B arbra usually gave the maid the rest of the day off , explaining she was going to be with friends. Then after the therap ist and myself arrived, we would take her to \"the h ouse-house,\" as she called it. One night we were called out for a 'Barbra emergenc y' and when her therapist and I arrived we found Ba rbra in the closet upstairs at the 'house-house,' even before i t was carpeted. She couldn't wait. She was all hudd led into a little ball and crying with her hair all stringy and hangi ng in her face. She looked like a little frightened child. She was breaking down often and her controllers couldn't af ford for her to break up yet . She was a real mess . She just survived to do what they needed her to do. She sat in my lap and I nurtured her and she showed me her dolls and things. I massaged her and did reflexology, accupre ssure, polarity, whatever I could do to help her. I did body treatments on her often, usually more th an once a week - up to five times a week - and it u sually ended up in sex as she initiated it. Barbra had to be kep t together because she had been used to make the co nnections to some very important people, and especially to the m asses. Because she had been so heavily invested in, as a mind control asset, they now had to keep her \"maintained \" 24 hours a day at times and had to use other slav es to shore her up. Unlike a \"normal\" person, she could never talk about what she saw and remembered in private (durin g sleep or upon awakening) without being monitored. Whatever i t took or cost was worth it to her controllers beca use they built her up to a certain targeted audience so comp letely that her controllers paid exorbitant amounts of money to keep her together, and her fans would pay any amoun t to see her. Many may themselves be under mind con trol. They carefully prepared Barbra to harmonically cont rol crowds . She did, not only with the natural talent she has and the trained harmonics in her voice, but also with t he hand signals and word combinations she sang. She is a total robot and is breaking down, but they will spend a fortune to keep her together (lik e poor Elvis) until she just can't function anymore . So no expense was spared for her. We organized li ttle tea parties for Barbra based on different themes given to us by my professor in the Master's program. We'd buy items that were just made for Bar bra. I would stop at Michael's Party Shop and give them th e list of items and the sales people would gather i t all up for me. Then I'd go to Barbra, switched to the personal ity inside of me who was created to be older than m e and older than Barbra, the one who was designed to care for t he \"Big B,\" the \"Queen B,\" when she needed it. She was our friend. We hated to see her crumble. Sometimes the Council gave me different drugs for Barbra . She always got to choose one, but I think they all must have done the same thing, just packaged in different wrappers or capsules. As"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"soon as she would pass out, and that is what she al ways did, a group of men would come into the house with equipment to work on her. Sometimes it looked like her body came off the couch from the electroshock. It was awful to watch. Then when they took the equipment o ff of her body, it would be cold and clammy, yet sh e would have a band of sweat on her face. It was my job, or her therapist's, to get her back on her feet again . Sometimes she would sleep for days afterward. Then I heard them say they had to adjust her, that is, g ive her more \"sessions.\" When she came around we would be soft and kind and gentle to her and eventually she would come out of it. A friend of her therapist helped Barbra, too, on nigh ts she couldn't. It became increasingly difficult t o manage getting her put back together. It was a team effort. I gave her injections, also. I was taught to pinch the sk in on the top fatty portion of her arm, then stick the needle in it so I couldn't hurt anything. I was given a syringe to deliver drugs to arms or thighs when and if the need arose, which la ter became quite often. I had to give Barbra the in jections whenever they told me to; otherwise they would have killed us both. I'd seen them do it to others. Barbra liked for me to sing with her and harmonize. She said it made her feel happy like the good ole' days when she was young. She had on pink bell bottoms and a w hite tank top. She was really out there, stoned, dr unk, or drugged out of her mind. The massage idea helped ke ep a slave enslaved and contained because the accup ressure points often matched up correctly with programmed t ouch spots. It worked well. Bodywork eased the stre ss of the body while locking the mind in program - a great le isurely and heavenly containment idea to further im prison mind control slaves. With rich and famous slaves they said it was easy b ecause they could send them off on endless journeys, trips, workshops, special spas, expos, et c ., because these slaves had the money to pursue dif ferent avenues that often led them directly back into containment. The Colony is not far from Point Mugu Naval Base (a mind control programming center) and seems to have been in conveniently close proxim ity for reconditioning purposes . More on Point Mugu later. They also programmed us to \"psychically\" deliver me ssages or directions for slaves to follow, since we all had the belief in psychic gifts, etc. and were so suggestib le. To some celebrities (most of them women), while giving them a massage, I would touch certain 'points' on their bo dy while dropping a psychic prediction and they wou ld think I was really gifted when in a few days, my prediction would come true. The higher the level of the slave, the more the controllers were willing to invest financially to m ake the predicted experience \"come to pass .\" Someone of Streisand's stature and programmed investment was w orth a \"prediction come true episode\" that had clas s and dignity. This is not to say that I don't believe in psychic reality, because I do, but these psychic r ealities were created and controlled, by those who sought to create circu mstances that were making them lots of money. I was used with Streisand most often in 1985-1987, during the time I attended Pepperdine University in Malibu. Before 1985, I was sent to her when she needed me i n the evenings in Malibu. Craig often drove me out to dinner to accomplish these rendezvous, but after I started at Pepperdine, I would tell him that I had to go back to the campus to study. I often parked in the Pepperdine Library parking lot where I was picked up by the men in sui ts and dropped off at Barbra's house. This way they had di fferent cars going in and out. Lots of times I was told to go to her during daytime hours. I had a high level of fea r that was present with me most all the time, only I was so scared and programmed that I was unable to think about it with my mind. But my pain-filled, often weary and e xhausted body told the truth of my experiences. Barbra switched personalities a lot . I think that might be why she was afraid to perfo rm on stage. Those with 'the eyes to see and the ears to hear' might have greate r insight in regard to an article written about her in the July 1994 issue of Ladies Home Journal. In it, when asked abo ut her string of unhappy relationships and her inab ility to have long-lasting relationships, in her own words Barbra states, \"I live with a lot of angst,\" and \"I'm a m ass of contradictions. I change and I grow. I change my mi nd all the time. So tell (whatever) man I'm looking for that if he likes to have affairs with lots of women, then I'm perfect for him!\" Could she be referring to first-h and experience with Multiple Personality Disorder? When she did perform, such as the concert she gave at her home in Malibu, she had to have someone like me to focus on internally, someone who was part of her pr ogrammed reality so she could feel stronger. To acc omplish this she was programmed to pretend that myself or someon e else was standing next to her on stage so it woul d shore her up to do the performance. Then she performed, just like she was programmed to do, delivering her contr oller's strategy to the unsuspecting and perhaps partially programmed crowd. I once overheard Henry say that h e would"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"give the public what they wanted and demanded celeb rities and fanfare - since that was all they were c apable of understanding anyway. He said most of the private s ector were totally ignorant of governmental matters and that, since they didn't avail themselves to knowledge of the way their country was run, it was evident that they really wanted and needed for \"those in the know\" to take c harge and run things. He said that since he and oth er leaders were interested and capable, they would do the job, making the decisions and seeing to it that things ran smoothly. Hollywood celebrities are constantly tied back into the White House to add flair and drama , and to bring in covert funds, but most importantly to add diversion to keep the American public focuse d in whatever direction the controllers want, instead of having the public focu sed on what is really going on behind the scenes . One time when I was shoring up Barbra at her home, I found her huddled down, crouching, wringing her h ands, terrified. She looked up at me in a childlike manne r and said, \"I don't have to sing tonight, do I?\" I said, \"No, honey, not tonight.\" She replied in a childlike voice, \"Ph ew...\" I felt frightened to see her acting like a c hild when she switched to very young parts of herself, and didn't know what to expect when she said, \"Let's play wit h the clay again.\" She had a table where we sat to play with c lay. It looked like a child's table for adult size people. She switched personalities often then, so we would have tea parties and play games to entertain her child personalities. Her son also played different games with her. One t ime she dressed like a clown and was acting and kic king like doing karate and she yelled out, \"Hey Jason!\" and h e came running and jumped into bed with her and sta rted cuddling. Then they both went to sleep and, as inst ructed, I could then leave. Sometimes she wanted he r therapist to join them and would say, \"Come and see how fun Jas is.\" And, one of us would. We were all unable, inca pable, and not of our own mind to choose anything else. Usuall y we cleaned up the mess she had made playing and t hen afterwards, would cover her up, tiptoe out of her r oom and leave. I flew from Kauai, after I had these memories about Barbra, in order to meet with one of my therapists . She met me at a restaurant in Los Angeles and as I told her ab out the memories I had about Barbra Streisand the c olor drained from her face. Later, I understood her intense reac tion, as I became aware that Barbra was her client. That day we both sat in shock and silence. I knew then that, al though my therapist and I did not understand what e verything meant, the love that we both believed in and the Ho ly Spirit that led us was ever-present. And not kno wing what else to do, all I know is that the love and compass ion I have for Barbra Streisand and all victims of mind control demands that I now share this information. I told B arbra's therapist everything I knew at that time, s o she could attempt to help Barbra. Since I was no longer in Ca lifornia and easily accessible, I stopped being the one used to keep Barbra Streisand under program. I am glad for that. Elton John Elton John's, \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, \" with it s obvious potential to trigger those with Oz progra mming, called my attention. Elton wrote Candle in the Wind , in regard to Marilyn Monroe , and he later produced a version in honor of Princess Di . He sings, \"...you crawled out of the woodwork and they whispered into your brain, they set you on the treadmill and they made you cha nge your name.\" He continues, \"...Hollywood created a superstar and pain was the price you paid. Even whe n you died, oh the press still hounded you, all the papers had to say was Marilyn was found in the nude...\" and, \"... the candle burned out long before your legend ever did.\" In Someone Saved My Life Tonight Elton sings \"...sitting like a princess perched in her e lectric chair.\" \"...You nearly had me roped and tied, alter-bound, hypnotiz ed, Sweet Freedom whispered in my ear, \"You're a bu tterfly, and butterflies are free to fly, fly away, high awa y, bye, bye.\" Perhaps Elton knows personally about these Project Monarch, mind control issues and in his own way, th rough his songs, has attempted to help others to fr eedom. I know that his songs personally affected me deeply a nd I felt that he might have 'understood.' So much so, that I attended one of his 1996 concerts at the St. Louis Riverport Amphitheatre and sent one of my books , STARSHINE: One Woman's Valiant Escape From Mind Con trol , backstage to him . However, I suspect that the stagehand that took the sparkling package from me n ever delivered it to Elton, since I never received his response . We Are the World "},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Writing this chapter also brings to mind the video done in the 80's by a group of famous actors, actre sses, and singers, who met in Hollywood with the special purp ose of recording WE ARE THE WORLD. An urgent common concern brought these entertainers, normally compet itive with one other, together and they set aside t heir differences to serve a higher purpose; bringing in funds for starving children in Africa. The line the y sang, \"We're saving our own lives,\" may be truer for some of the se individuals than they can 'think' about due to t he mind control some of them may be under. This information I have provided to you may change the way you look at many of Hollywood's finest celebrities, many of whom myself and others have witnessed being victimized at the hands of the ruthless people who control others for reasons of power, money and domination, with the end result serving their agenda - the New World Order. I beg for you t o question and look into these issues I bring befor e you, because the lives of many that are as yet in bondage rely o n it. If we truly serve others as we have been spirituall y called to do, and understand that what we do for others we do for ourselves and ultimately for God, then we must join together to stop this control of the minds of some of our most talented and creative people. Together, we can help create a world that is safe and free, where c reative and talented children are safe to grow up without the f ear of being owned or manipulated by the hidden gro up of individuals who now are in power on our planet - a group who does not believe in freedom, but instead is invested in totalitarianism, torture, mind control and human slavery. Please help me expose and stop this insan e form of abuse and hidden slavery and set the captives free! \"The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me to bring good tidings to the afflicted; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the openin g of the prison to those who are bound.\" – Isaiah 61:1 Chapter Twenty-two Prince Phillip, Prince Charles, and Princess Di \"I Know You, l Walked With You Once Upon A Dream\" For mind control purposes, a song from Disney's Sle eping Beauty was instilled into my programming to k eep all memory of hidden events separate from my conscious mind. The lyrics as I remembered them reminded me, \"I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream. I kn ow you, with you in my arms you're so familiar agai n... \" I was programmed to feel familiar with kings, princes , and presidents and this song served to reorient m e into my dream reality, the one that existed Over the Rainbo w. I was prostituted to Prince Phillip and also Prince Charles. On one occasion, Prince Charles explained to me that royalty are given the right and reserve to have aff airs outside of the royal family . He said it was in the interest of their country for the royals to remain balanced and happy, and that was done by whatever means needed in order to accomplish that. The requirement was that they were discreet and didn't get caught. I was prostituted to both Phillip and Charles in Lo s Angeles on different occasions and was set up wit h them at other times in Washington, DC, London, and New York . Prince Phillip thought he was God's gift to the world, and was arrogant and egotistical . Charles was much different. He was quieter, more somber, an d more controlled . The Council told me it was important for me to form a sexual b ond with him. Charles liked to talk a lot in bed . He would lay on his side with his head cradled in his hand and talk and talk to me. He said that he was very lonely, that Di never talked to him about anything of substance and that they just didn't seem to be matched that way. He told me that they had good sex but that was it , and that he had trouble getting her to act like a member of the royal family was suppose to act so they could lead their country in the way it needed to be run. He said that she didn't"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"have much depth and was more interested in how she looked than anything else and he said, \"Frankly, that bores me.\" While I listened to him, his sharp nose, dark hair on his chest and the litt le crop of dark hair right at the small of his back grooved indelible memory in my mind fil es . After the first time we were together, he liked t o be on top when we had sex. I don't think he knew I was a programmed slave . He just treated me like a trusted confidant, a friend, a lover, but sex was never paramount to him . Charles explained to me that it was important for the royal family to have a good public image in order to wield the power they have, to lead the masses. He said that i f the royal family was seen as weak and unstable, i t could lead to a level of chaos within the English society. He said if a royal family could maintain stability, through whatever means necessary, then it was for the good of the wh ole country . So said Charles. The Rockefeller family set me up with Charles and I was instructed to just be a good listener wit h him and to report back to them what he said. They wanted to know what his dreams, desires, likes and dislikes were so that they could use that information in the future to co ntrol him, and ultimately, his country. They wanted to know his \"Achilles heel\" so that they could use his weakness to their advantage in regard to political and busi ness dealings between our countries. They arranged a trip for the royal couple to come t o the United States and they took great care to set everything up just right for their enjo yment . I was used as a guide, a person they could turn t o for anything they needed or wanted. I was directed to a nticipate whatever needs they might have and fulfil l them. I was assigned to purchase Disney toys for the boys that were left in their room upon arrival. Food, clothes , rest, massages, shopping, entertainment, anything they wa nted, I arranged it for them. They paid for Diana to get the full treatment at a beauty salon during the time set up for me to target Charles . They put me with Charles while the rest of the roya l family was being entertained and I was told to te nd to him. As always, they told me that he was shy and, because o f his position, could not ever make a sexual advanc e to a public individual. So, they explained to him that I was a trusted and safe person, and in turn instructed me that all I had to do was to come on to him; he knew the door was open and safe, all I had to do was lead the way. While Di was off getting coiffeured and someone tended the children, I was told to lunch with Charles in the room and t hen to come on to him. When it was time, I reached out and touc hed the white dress shirt that covered his chest an d when I saw that this created a favorable reaction, I reached o ut and took hold of his hand. I was trained that a man must feel sure that you care about him and will not humiliate or m ake fun of him in any way . He was to feel 100% safe with me. So during lunch, I listened very carefully to everything he said and kept building him up, complimenting him and showing him that I re ally understood what he was telling me completely. He seemed to need and like that a lot. Towards the end of lunch, he picked up my hand and kissed the insi de of my palm and told me how wonderful it was to have someone he cou ld talk to, someone who really understood . He explained that there were not many people he could talk to like this in his country, because it could leak to other people and then it could cause him and his country many problems. Prince Charles said that it had been explained how trusted I had been to the Rockefellers over the years and how he could also trust me, that I would keep private \"our meeting,\" he called it . He was very sincere and acted like he meant every word he said. Evidently, Charles really trusted the Rockefellers . I don't know why . After he kissed my hand, I reached over and put my hand on his face and reiterated that he was safe wi th me and that I was thoroughly briefed on what his needs wou ld be while he was visiting, and that he could tota lly relax knowing that anything that was said or done would r emain private and protected. With sincere gratitude he said, \"That means the world to me. It is not often that I am allowed this privilege.\" The royal family was on a schedule and I only had a couple of hours to do the job I was assigned to do on Charles. After listening and a sexual rendezvous, I took him into the shower and soaped him down and rinsed him off, then helped him out, dried him off, and brought him some clothes. He seemed comfortable with all of the att ention and I acted like I loved nothing more than doing everythi ng for him. While he combed his hair he explained t o me while he was looking into the mirror, that he was not use d to the luxury of being alone in this way, that at home he always had servants attending to him and so he really like d the time we had together. Taking his hand, I delivered the message that I was pre-programmed to deliver, layin g the groundwork my controllers dictated for future encounters . I explaining that I deeply enjoyed the time we ha d spent together and looked forward to many other such joyous occasions! He smiled and said yes, and I let myself out of the room. There were security m en in the hallway by their suite and I smiled at them, neatly redressed now in my navy suit and heels, as I walk ed to the"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"elevator. My instructions after I left Charles were to go to a room down on another floor and let myse lf in with a key I would find in my pocket. Once in the room, I picked up the phone and dialed a number and began telling all the details of our conversation and time together . For all I know, I may have been talking to a tape r ecorder on the other end . Without making any other conversation, I finished my debrief and hung up. Then I went down to the lobby. The hotel was very elegant, with waterfalls, wood, glass, and brass decorating the lobby. I do not know the name or where I actually was. Charles' repeated disclosure of the vital importanc e of his relationship with Di remaining stable for the good of his country was the information Kissinger and the Rocke fellers needed to form their strategy. I believe th at now armed with this information, they had the perfect way to destabilize England , through destabilizing the royal couple's relationship. So they did just that and began devising a plan to destroy Di and Charles' relationship from the inside out. Over time, little seeds of doubt were planted , originating from Kissinger's and the Rockefeller's strategic plan , at times delivered through me, about the royal coup le's relationship and about Di to Charles and about Charles to Di, and they may have worked them both from other a ngles. I know that they had me give certain message s that were meant to be a wedge between the two. They were always subtle, never aimed directly at them, but t he inferences were there. For example, I was sent in to talk to Di . They had me befriend her by giving me information about her that I could 'drop' at a time when we were alone. I did and she opened up and began crying, which is just exactly w hat they wanted her to do. Then I talked to her and helped h er feel better. They wanted a bond to be set in pla ce for later use so they could get inside information about England. Even more they wanted to know how they could \"get to Charles\" in order to influence him without him know ing. I was with them several times and each time sp ent time alone with Di talking about her difficulties. She seemed starved to talk to someone who understoo d and I had been armed with enough information to be that understand ing person . Our controllers wanted the familiarity to 'breed' in each succeeding visit so they could have more and m ore of a doorway in to influence the royals. I overheard our controllers arguing about using me with her again . They said, \"We can't risk having her become a famil iar face .\" To which another man reported, \"She's a long way from home and so is Di and they will never meet again by accident in a million years. You worry too much. These thing s always have a way of working themselves out .\" So, the other man said, \"Okay, okay, we'll use her, but just one more time.\" I could relate to Di. We were both married, had chi ldren and shared some common ground, including havi ng husbands that were not sexually passionate and seem ed disinterested in that way. They were hoping to b e able to keep Di involved because she was so easy to access - as they termed it, \"loose-lipped.\" But that isn't how it worked out. After Di was comfortable with me, I was programmed to discl ose that I wished I had a husband who liked to be very sexual with me . All the while my programmers knew from my report of Charles' sexual encounter that he was not a sexually motivated man. Then they could go ab out directing their media arms to capture and detai l any problems that came between the royal couple, even a t times creating problems that were not there in th e first place - creating suspicions on both sides . It was an ugly strategy, but looking back, it wor ked. The monarchy was destabilized by this plan. \"We cannot live only for ourselves. A thousand fibers connect us with our fellow men; and along these fibers, as sympathetic threads, our actions run as causes, and they come back to us as effects . \" -- Herman Melville Chapter Twenty-three They Stole My Baby London, England was cold in the winters and was ver y cold and dreary. Many of the buildings I was taken into were made out of grey stone, and everything took on a gr ayish cast . Maybe that was due to the ominous experiences I h ad while in England. There were a lot of ornate black wrought iron fences around estates; even the parkwa ys and parks"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"often had fences surrounding them. I accompanied Re agan to London many times. I overheard that these w ere important assignments in facilitating diplomatic re lations. This time Ronald Reagan had on a black ove rcoat and we were walking across the street to visit an older la dy with dark grey hair. She wore a hat and very stu rdy shoes and a suit. I think she was the Queen of England , or at least someone of importance. It was not Mar garet Thatcher, though. She explained that she could walk around in her country without Secret Service agents but chos e wisely the time she went on \"outings,\" she called them. She ha d a medium size dog that she took when she went on walks. She was very opinionated and very dominating . For some personal reason she didn't like Nancy at all and said that Ron and I made such a handsome twosome that it was a sh ame that Ron and I weren't a couple. She told him t hat Nancy made him look older than his years, and that a baby born of Reagan and I would make her happy. She said she felt there was some special chemistry and she wanted it badly . She was convinced that I was Sharon Weatherby and that I had excellent lineage . All this bloodline stuff really meant a lot to her and for whatever reason, I was the target. Maybe the Council influenced her and told h er I was someone I wasn't. I don't know. We gathered to talk in a sitting room with all whit e wicker furniture. There was a bird in a large orn ate metal cage and there were lots of beautiful plants around. I r emember how she and everyone around her spoke in En glish accents. They talked about the PLO and other news o f the day, but I couldn't retrieve all the words in order to more completely remember their conversations. She had seen my capabilities; the mind files , the profound statements delivered in public (pre-programmed though they wer e by the Council), the wit (pre-programmed by the C ouncil) and she felt I had some extraordinary genetic structure and she wanted some of it . She viewed this breeding thing like people think about horse and dog breeding. She was really into it and she had her mind set on having an offspring of mine coupled with Reagan, whom she tho ught was the perfect father. There were many meetin gs where this subject was discussed and eventually she got her wish . The child I bore for her was the result of many m eetings of negotiations over the years. The talks started out slowly as she and Reagan took small safe steps toward defining their otherwise preposterous scheme . The child that was born for the Queen was to be bro ught up in a strict environment and groomed for later marriage into the royal family . It was a baby that was delivered into the arms of some of her people. They said this baby was a gift of diplomacy between our countries. Reagan called the baby a peace offe ring to show the United Kingdom our willingness to extend a hand toward future relations with their country. When t he doctors were ready to deliver my not yet full-term baby, I was taken aboard an airplane . They laid me on a cot-like gurney made of white canvas on a metal frame. There was an IV bottle hanging over my head and I was afraid it was going to swing off its stand as the plane was entering tu rbulent weather. I couldn't say anything, because I had a mask over my face. My baby was born in the air , delivered by doctors dressed in surgical gowns an d masks. They had utensils and long- shaped stainless steel bowls with alcohol or some t ype of sterile solution for their utensils. There w ere no nurses. Just two doctors. The baby was also to be part of some experiment. As I flashbacked, abreacted, and retrieved this memory I felt the uterine contractions and pain, my tailbone hurt and stung because they gave me a spi nal injection. I didn't have the baby naturally; I heard the docto rs say the word \"epidural,\" but at the time didn't know what that word meant. After the baby was born and the plane l anded, one doctor wrapped him all up in a thin whit e blanket and soon headed out the door of the plane with him. I screamed with everything I was: \"NO! NO! NO!\" Bu t I don't know if I was able to scream the words out loud or if I was just screaming inside. Tears were streamin g from my face. I looked out the airplane window and saw a dark-hai red man and a woman with medium-length blonde hair standing together on the tarmac . The doctor who took my tiny newborn son from me handed him first to the dark- haired man who, in turn, handed him into the arms o f the woman . The doctor then pointed for them to go on and I thought I would die when this couple took my baby a nd walked away. When the doctor reboarded the airplane he and the other man said I made a wise choice and made a great contribution to society. I didn't know what they me ant . I hadn't made any choice . As they spoke of matters of national security, I was becoming increasingly more hysterical . The doctor injected a drug into the IV bottle tha t instantly put me asleep. The next thing I knew I wa s dressed in a grey sweat suit and groggily walked out of the airplane to my mom who was dressed in a red sweat s hirt, white blouse and red pants. She took my face in her hands and said, \"How's my sweetie?\" and she helped me to the car. I overheard the doctor say the baby was of good siz e despite the fact that he had been taken so early. All I could see was the top of his beautiful little head because he was wrapped so tightly in the blanket, but my love for him was"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"and still is intense and powerful. He was part of m e, but they took him away. I never saw my baby agai n. I was grateful when they drugged me out of my misery beca use the feelings and experience were overwhelming a nd I couldn't take anymore. My body started shaking unco ntrollably and I was freezing but they said it was okay - normal in fact. It sure didn't feel normal. I was i n a daze for a few days, quiet, withdrawn and very, very depressed. My soul ached. It still does today. The grief is totally encompassing. When I think of him I still cry uncontrollably. How could they steal my baby? How could they? \"Jesu s wept.\" -- John 11:35 \"Thus says the Lord: Refrain your voice from weepin g, and your eyes from tears; for your work shall be rewarded, says the Lord and (your children) shall return from the enemy's land. And there is hope in your future, says the Lord; your children shall come again to their own country .\" -- Jeremiah 31:1617 Chapter Twenty-four USC: Higher Education or Mind Control Uncle Charlie Donates $4.7 Million to USC In 1973, as Uncle Charlie greased the way, Craig en tered University of Southern California (USC) Denta l School and commuted everyday from our home in Agoura to do wntown Los Angeles. As I was to later find out, Cha rles Lilley Horn had quite a name at USC, as well as in San Francisco at the United States Mint. He persona lly knew members of the Federal Reserve Board. As I discover ed, he was connected to Federal Reserve Bankers; ol d money, and Hearst newspaper type of old money friends. Uncle Charlie was a direct link with the Council through the money he was able to generate . He was revered by those who knew him as a trusted businessman, a family man who was adept in politics and investments. I believe Charles Horn was the single most important family link to my control by the global elitists . The reality of what I was involved in was careful ly concealed every Christmas when I dutifully sent a box of See's Candy to him and his wife at their winter home in Scottsdale, Arizona. I was drugged and programmed that this act of gift-giving reminde d me to forget, which it did for many years. And, I was programmed to watch the popular television series , Charlie's Angels , in my controllers' attempt to cover and scramble my memory. Charles Lilley Horn , as Chairman of the Board, retained control of Federal Cartridge Corporation for many years until relinquishing control around 1970 to hi s progeny, Charles B. Horn and William B. Horn , presumably his sons . Federal Cartridge Corporation is a munitions manu facturer, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota (address: 2700 Foshay Tower, Minneapolis, MN). Dun & Bradstre et Million Dollar Directory indicates that Federal Cartridge Corporation was a long-time subsidiary of the Olin Foundation, Inc . headquartered in New York City. The Foundation Directory shows that Charles Lilley Horn also was President of the Olin Foundation, Inc . throughout the 1960's and 1970's. The Olin Foundation, Inc. (currently F.W. Olin Foundation, Inc .) was established as a charitable trust in 1938 for Franklin W. Olin, founder of Olin Industries , which later merged with the Mathieson Chemical Company , eventually becoming the Olin Corporation of today . During the 1970's, the Olin Corporation was interlocked with the Chase Manhattan Corporation , whose Chairman was David Rockefeller (see diagram). The Rockefellers, of course, have l ong had controlling interest in the United States Federal Reserve, which as many pe ople know is actually a private corporation, with s hareholders. "},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"According to The Foundation Directory (1995), the F .W. Olin Foundation, Inc. (with William B. Horn, Vi ce President) listed its assets at $317 million (as of 1993). The Directory describes the Foundation's pu rpose and activities as \"primarily for constructing and equip ping new academic buildings and libraries at privat e four-year, accredited degree-granting colleges and universitie s...\" In the book, Understanding Foundations (1967) , the Olin Foundation, Inc. is similarly described; it states, \"Many grants in education are made, especially for construction. Grants show a preference for the field of engineeri ng... Recent recipients have been the University of Southern California...\" (among others). This information was confirmed by the USC Office of University Advancem ent, indicating two grants given to USC in the 1960's by the Olin Foundation: (1) In 1964, $2.4 million to fund the Olin Hall of Engineering and (2) in 1965, $2.5 million t o fund the Vivian Hall of Engineering. With these d onations, it is no wonder that Uncle Charlie (Charles Lilley Horn), who was President of the Olin Foundation at the ti me, was popular at USC, particularly with the Engineering S chool which is currently located in Olin Hall. Interestingly, during the 1960's the USC School of Engineering was transformed into a major research facility and expanded into several new areas, including biomedic al engineering. Today the Engineering School boasts several academic departments and research centers. One such research facility is the Center For Neural Engineering , which lists among its research activities: (1) Hardware Models of Hippocampus Toward Brain Implants as Neural Protheses for Memory Loss; (2) USC Brain Project ; and (3) USC DARPA (Defense Advance Research Project Age ncy) Ultra-Scale Computing Project-to name a few. Apparently, the USC Brain Project is sponsored by t he National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA). It is also worth mentioning that the DARPA project involves \" Hybrid Neuron-Silicon Computational Systems For Pattern Recognition \" which includes the interface of electrode arrays with hippocampal tissue slices and neuron cultures, as well as growth techniques for c ortical neurons on silicon substrates, and even tec hnologies to interface silicon-based computer systems and neurob iological systems. In 1998, the USC Alfred E. Mann Institute for Biomedical Engineering received a donation of $100 million from biomedical entrepreneur Alfred E. Mann , for whom the Institute is named. The donation was said to be one of the largest in the history of higher e ducation, and is second largest ever to USC, behind $120 million donated by Walter H. Annenberg to the School of Communication. Standing back and looking at this pa tchwork picture painted above, highlighted by advan ced research projects in biomedical engineering and inc redible amounts of funding, one cannot help but be struck by the obvious potential at the USC School of Engineering for major advancements in the technology and applic ation of MIND CONTROL! HELLOOOOOO! Now, ask yourself, why is DARPA (American Defense) operating in a university setting ? What are they actually researching ? What do you think is really going on ? One can see that foundations don't always make do nations to university academic departments that one might expe ct, based on the donors' apparent line of business. Another example is the H. Leslie Hoffman and Elaine S. Hoffman Foundation , with assets approaching $20 million. H.L. Hoffman was the CEO of the Hoffman Electronics Corporation , a long-time Los Angeles-based company since 1932, in the business of manufacturing various elec tronic devices, generally entertainment related (in cluding special ones for government agencies). The USC Hoffman Medical Research building is named after its donor Elaine S. Hoffman . The Hoffman Engineering Company , located in Minnesota, is listed as a division of Uncle Charlie's Federal Cartridge Corporation . Hoffman Engineering makes metal and composite enc losures for electrical and electronic controls, instruments and components. I wonder if they made covers that house those nasty ECT devices I was regularly zapped with ? To date, I haven't yet determined a linkage betwe en Hoffman Electronics and Hoffman Engineering, but that Hoffman Medical Research conn ection sounds promising. Apparently later on , Federal Cartridge and Hoffman Engineering merged to become Federal Hoffman Corporation (FC Holdings, Inc.). In 1988, the company was purchased by the Minnesota -based Pentair Corporation , increasing Pentair's total sales by nearly 40%, and is currently listed as a subsidi ary of Pentair in the Directory of Corporate Affili ations. After that transaction, Uncle Charlie's relations no longer ap pear among Federal Cartridge Corporation's corporat e officers,"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"but instead have been listed among the officers of the Olin Foundation, according to the Foundation Di rectory. Uncle Charlie continued to be an invisible influenc e in my life. But even though I was unaware of this , in my public and conscious reality I was still working as a dent al assistant, though unknowingly placing dental implants ( some type of miniature electronic transmitters ) into the teeth of unsuspecting patients , without my own conscious knowledge and awareness. My four day work week for Dr. Jacoby , a USC dental school graduate, was extremely productive, for him. While I did all the hands-on d ental work with his patients, including fitting and cementing bands, making archwires and headgears, removing bra ces, making retainers, and performing general check -ups, Dr. Jacoby sat in his private office and either read ma gazines or worked on his computer. At 22 years old, Craig and I had no idea that our lives were totally controlled and not our own; nor could we have known that we were living our lives under total and complete mind control. Who Are the Annenbergs? Moses Annenberg made his fortune during the Prohibition days by cre ating an information monopoly on which bookies and gambling mobsters depended . His cartel controlled a nationwide racetrack news wire service, The Trans-National, headquartered in Chicago. The stree t savvy he gained first as a newsboy, then later as a high executive within the William Randolph Hearst media empire , gave Annenberg the wherewithal to pull off his racing news coup, and made him one of America's wea lthiest men. However, in 1939, Annenberg was convicted of tax fraud and was forced to give up the wire servic e aspect of his business . This brought about a battle to take over control, which resulted in several sensational murd ers , including that of Bugsy Seigel , who, as Al Capone's west coast agent of Trans-American, managed to wrest con trol over Trans-National through the strong arm tac tics of his 'enforcer,' Mickey Cohen . Annenberg's media empire then continued on as Triangle Publications and included the Daily Racing Form. By 1946, the dust cleared, but all the turbulence s oon brought about a Congressional investigation int o organized crime in America, headed by Senator Estes Kefauver's Committee . Following its hearings, the Committee concluded that mob-control of the racing news wire service was undermining America and represented the heart of mob operations. During 1950 and 1951 the Kefauver C ommittee heard from 600 witnesses, \"...including most of the powerful gangsters of the day. It was an astonishing spectacle. Never before did so many criminals pass in review before the general pu blic; never before were so many put on display sing ly or in tandem as members of a single community of ou tlaws.\" ( Albert Fried , 1993) During this time, Walter H. Annenberg had dropped out of the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in about 1930 to join his father's com pany, as a bookkeeper. In 1942, he became the compa ny's president. As head of Triangle Publications , Walter Annenberg st arted two new hugely successful publications, TV Guide , America's best selling weekly magazine, and Seventeen magazine , and continued in his father's path as a media mogul . In 1988, Rupert Murdoch , a leader in the media industry, purchased TV Guide, Seventeen , and Daily Racing Form from Annenberg's company for $3 billion . The following year, Annenberg established the charitable trust known as The Annenberg Foundation . Its current assets are listed as $2.6 billion. According to the Foundation Directory, the Foundation's current primary purpose is to support \"early childhood and K-12 education (including public school restructuring and reform) .\" In 1993, Annenberg announced a $550 million gift, the largest private donation ever to benefit education, providing a series of grants for school reform projects geared toward improving elementary and secondary ed ucation. Regarding this donation , the Los Angeles Times (Dec. 17, 1993) reported : \"Although White House officials refused to give det ails of the awards, three groups are expected to ge t a major share of the money: the New American Schools Development Corp . in Alexandria, VA [which is not far from the CIA's Langley headquarters]; the Coalition of Essential Schools at Brown Univers ity in Providence, R.I.; and the Education Commission of the States in Denver [boy, that area has been in the news recently, first, the Jon Benet Ramsey murder m ystery and now the Littleton school massacre]."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" The New American Schools Development Corp. was begu n in 1991 [coincidentally, just before the 1992 ele ction year] by business leaders and George Bush Administr ation officials who believed that they could develo p more effective and creative learning programs outside th e traditional public school system [I guess George' s presidential lap would qualify in that case]. This colossal dona tion came on the heels of one just months prior, a gift of $365 million to four colleges, including the record $120 million donation to the University of Southern Cal ifornia, as mentioned earlier, another $120 million to Annenber g's alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, $10 0 million to Peddie School, Annenberg's preparatory school in Ne w Jersey, and $25 million to Harvard University [He nry's old stomping ground]. After creating the Annenberg Inst itute for School Reform, the Santa Monica - Malibu Unified School District received a $500,000 grant from the Los Angeles Annenberg Metropolitan Project. Prior to that, according to the L.A. Times (Jan 24, 1996), Annenberg had given $53 million to fund a f iveyear school reform project in Los Angeles County, purpor tedly \"to begin work in elementary schools to wipe out [cultural] differences between the two groups [i.e. Santa Monica and Malibu kids].\" The School Distric t, after receiving a $5 million share of project funds, reac hed an agreement with Rand Corp ., a Santa Monica based 'think tank,' to evaluate the projects impact on the Distr ict's 10,500 students. Rand Corp . has long been known for its techno-information-orie nted projects , and is reputed to have participated in ' MKULTRA like' projects during the 60's . Note two of its studies: - P-2575 \"Long-lasting Effects of LSD on Certain Attitudes in Normals : An Experimental Proposal\" (1962) - P-2676 \"Experimental Designs for Investigating Conditioning\" (1966) In its Index to Selected Publications of The Rand C orporation, it lists among its areas of research in vestigation in the field of psychology, the following: \" Automata ,\" \" Laboratory Man-Machine Studies ,\" and \" Sleep Learning \" - many projects under these headings appear to have mind control applications. The Annenberg Estate is a sprawling 300-acre tract, located near the intersection of Frank Sinatra Bou levard and Bob Hope Drive, in Rancho Mirage, California (near Palm Springs) and features a private golf course, s wimming pool, and several lakes and ponds. Nicknamed \" Sunny-lands ,\" it has been the magical destination of the British Royalty , as well as the simply rich and famous, and is con sidered a second \"Camp David\" by U.S. Presidents. Walter Annenberg established his friendship with the British Royals back during the Nixon Administration , when he had accepted the post as U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James, Great Britain. Later, duri ng the Reagan Administration, his wife, Mme. Ambassador Leonore Annenberg , functioned as chief of Protocol to the White House. Their tie to Prince Charles was solidified during his visit to Sunnylands in 1 974, when he reputedly attempted to play the private golf course polo-styl e from his golf cart. Bob Hope , whose home is in Palm Springs, was a regular guest at the Annenberg Estate . He was valued for his many contacts and his contr ibution to the Annenberg's social register, which at times include d Henry Kissinger. Incidentally, Bob was knighted by Queen Elizabeth several years ago, as was \" Sir George Bush .\" Given my personal, though mind-controlled, involvem ent with Pete Wilson and others, in altering the California school system curriculum to include mind control (w hich I will discuss further in a later chapter), I believe my experiences reveal a mass plan for the 'enhancement ' of many children in ways that do not respect thei r freedoms. I invite the public to help me bring together the pie ces of this puzzle, in a way that will protect futu re generations. USC Dental School 1973 -1977 A big part of what I thought was our entertainment during my husband's dental school years was frequen ting USC football games. When we attended the games, I was t old to dress immaculately, and be ready with carefu lly groomed hair, make-up, and polished fingers and toe nails for the team. During the game I was programme d to stand up from my seat in the stadium and walk out through the tunnel to my left. My husband, now a USC Denta l School student, stayed in his seat just like he did when w e went to Dodger games. I walked to the locker room where the"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"team went during half time. Lots of times I didn't even see whom I was servicin g . I just felt like a sucking machine. On one such occasion the coach dressed me in a little cheerleading skirt and had sex with me in front of the mind controlled football robots that needed extra incentive to work harder, or as the coach said to them, \"Step right up and enjoy the pussy. Get it while it's hot,\" he'd s ay, like he was a street vendor and I was a piece o f meat. Then he would caution the players, \"But only if you perform today.\" If the players did well, performed to the coach's standards on the field, they got to have sex with a slave . If they did really well, they got to have one of us for the evening. I never stayed all night but entertained f or the evening. I don't know where my husband went but he was waiting, later that night in the dark, for me in hi s Datsun 280 Z. There were also USC basketball mind-controlled robots . I had to have sex with one of them in the locker room after a game we went to one evening. It was ju st a quickie since they didn't view the basketball team as important as the football team. O.J. Simpson was their star quarterback , their prize athlete , a real machine . He played at most of the USC football games that we attended. I remember hearing everyone talk about how the coach bought him an expensive new car . One time Henry gave some advice to the coach on pro gramming that he appreciated. One night at an alumni meeting, the coach spoke to a group of older alumni men around a table . They were all smoking and drinking at this so-called meeting. The coach said, \"This young lady has a very wealthy uncle and she's a Trojan all th e way.\" Then another man stepped forward and helped me onto the table as they started playing the song \"the strippe r\" and I took my street clothes off and danced in front of these drunken men. I was around 22. The men in charge seemed to all know who I was and where I came from . They seemed to regard me more as my Uncle Charlie 's than as my husband's. After I stripped, a man helped me off th e table and one drunken USC alumni yelled, \"Put her back up on the table and let's see her put her clothes back on . If she's gotta' put them back on, let's watch.\" S o I climbed back onto the table and a man kindly put a chair up ther e for me to sit on because I had nylons to put back on and it would have been hard to do standing up. They were s creaming and hollering which clothes to leave until last so I did as they said. On the way out I kissed the coach on the cheek and smiled and waved to all the men a s they whistled and cheered. They were drunker than skunks . I was trained to always kiss the man I was bolsteri ng on the cheek and be affectionate with him in front of the other men . But if the wives were there I was to remain discr eet. There were different rules for different situations . After that, I was passed all over USC, not as muc h among the mind-controlled robot students as the dirty old' al umni men. I don't think the men knew I was under mi nd control, but I believe USC Coach Reddin did. I was prostituted to the Dean of the Dental School af ter Craig got accepted . Dean Walker and Dean Crawford also seemed to be 'friends' of Charles Horn . I was prostituted to Coach Reddin , also, at times, like I cited above, in front of the football team for incentive. And there were a lot of other important persons at USC in th e main university, aside from the dental school, whom I wa s directed to \"cater to.\" Some of these men seemed to know all about my Uncle Charlie's family . I felt strange because, depending on which person ality I was keyed into, I didn't think of him as my family and didn't ever see him c onsciously, yet all these men referred to me as Mr. Horn's niece, Susan. I 'serviced' administrators at the main college and heads of different departments . Usually, I was briefly introduced to them in their offices and then after a football game or on an eve ning when I thought Craig and I were getting together with some of his classmates, I'd be taken to a hotel room to entertain one or more of them. From what I overheard and understo od, Uncle Charlie had a big role in providing fundi ng for the \"furthering of education at USC.\" I believe a lot o f his money went to further research or mind contro l 'projects,' such as different members of the football team. USC had to be full of mind control robots because U SC was granted huge sums of money if they participated in the mind control project . So, they participated in the academic and sports end of it in order to qualify for the grants. Plus , of course, there were persons in positions of lea dership at USC who were part of the 'elite' group. Mind Control Demonstrations I was \"demonstrated\" often at USC in front of docto rs, scientists or other professionals who were 'sel ected' to be a part of the project . The moderator, who was a big, tall, salt and pepp er gray-haired man introduced me as Charles Horn's niece , the founder of the project . Perhaps Uncle Charlie's money went to start the p roject at USC in the early 60's. Be that as it may, the moderator showed his a udience how I worked by calling out simple commands . Initially they weren't shown much, because what the moderator was attempting to do was enlist the aid and future work of some of these scientists and doctors. Half the men present already knew all about the pro ject and were there secretly"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"posing as people who were unaware. In actuality t hey were planted to influence the moral attitudes o f the other individuals ; they would agree easily in hopes that others woul d also agree, comply and join their research progra m. It usually worked as they said, \"To get them past a ny hang-ups they might have in regard to the fact t hat we're working with humans instead of animals.\" Then they proceeded to explain that the subjects we re originally defective in some way or they would say, \"all the results are actually d oing is enhancing the person's abilities, not hindering them in any way.\" They went to great lengths to condition some of the se men slowly over the first few meetings . They demonstrated my typing capabilites, \"speed a nd accuracy,\" the moderator said as he took the pap er from my typewriter and showed it around the room. T hen at later meetings they would demonstrate the photographic memory enhancement or some other 'enha ncement' this project had provided me. Initially, some of the men were not so much in favor of it or were hesitan t, so they were not invited back to subsequent meet ings . In this way, the project's secrecy was protected and not fu rther exposed to those who wouldn't support it. Uncle Charlie seemed to have done his part by keepi ng the money coming to them. The goal of the group at USC was to turn out thousands of \"enhanced citizens\" wh o would do their work and function on behalf of the cause . Because Charlie was popular there, so was 1, and they had plans to create some fine physicians, lawy ers, dentists, oral surgeons, etc., who lived in or around Los Ang eles , so the likelihood of them remaining in the area w as larger than the out-of-state people. They planned to make good use of them in the future after they were secu red in their professions. They laughed as they said, \"Hell, they'll owe it to us for making t hem some of the best professionals in their fields, so they won't mind donating some of t heir time back to their old alma mater !\" They needed a cluster of professionals in and aroun d the Los Angeles area to funnel illegal money thro ugh their business' at a high level, but many didn't even kno w their names were attached to separate monies filt ered in at selected banks who were positioned for just this pu rpose. There was a whole financial framework set up to support the project in the future, with every year, yieldin g more and more financial backing as the children w ere born and used to create more and more funding, and then thei r children eventually would attend USC or another a ffiliate school to crank out more \"cooperative\" professional graduates. I overheard a lot while I was waiting a t a meeting to service some man afterwards. But as instructed, I was recording into a mind file, wh at was said at the meeting in order to report back to Henry. Henry programmed into my mind a map of the campus at USC because it was such a large campus. And when I would have to go somewhere to service some man, he would tell me to go to D-3, for example, on the cam pus map inside my head and I'd know where to go. There was also a coding system to keep track of where I was t o be at a certain time at a future date. I went to many different buildings on the USC campu s for various reasons; sex and to pass messages to different scientists, professors o r doctors . There were times I was taken to a USC football ga me the whole entire game, just for one man's sexual pl easure. Craig was so focused on the game that he ne ver seemed to notice I was all messed up or that the perfect m ake-up that I had arrived in was smudged or that my hair was messed up. Some of the men I serviced had big motor homes that they parked right outside the stadium o r on the grounds of the Coliseum near USC where they would p icnic and party with their friends before the game. USC was a pilot project in Los Angeles, one designe d to harness and utilize some of the finest minds i n the country. These were the cream of the crop, some of the top a chievers from all over the nation and they wanted t o utilize them. They felt that mind controlled doctors, espec ially surgeons, were 100% more accurate than non-en hanced doctors and surgeons. They were experimenting to se e if by showing young interns how to do surgery vis ually, they could retain the procedures. There was an inner group of selected students who w ere chosen based on their childhood histories to be a part of the pilot proje ct . They felt they were creating super humans and used them to do their work . They used the technology on my husband and some o f his lab partners. I know because I heard Henry talk to Reagan and other \"insiders\" about this . He also made appointments for me to get 'treatments' there. Some rooms at USC marked \"a uthorized personnel only,\" at first seemed like dar k rooms for processing photos but they weren't. Instead they ha d chairs similar to dental chairs with goggles for virtual reality. The chairs vibrated, turned, and became hot or cold and made it feel like the scene I was seeing came alive. It sounded like, and the goggles made me feel that I w as spinning in space, swirling and spinning, and I got very, very dizzy. They exposed me to a lot of weird scary things . They also played very loud, irritating noises, li ke high shrill screeches and 'nails on a chalkboard.' It was often excruciating but my hands were immobilized on the chair arms so I couldn't reach up and pull the headphones or gogg les off; I dissociated in order to withstand it . These experiences happened to me on days when I went to the dental sc hool in order to have Craig work on my teeth. After the dental"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"work was completed, then I had this other torture. This was during the time Nixon was President, then Ford. Reagan was Governor and Kissinger was still in office. The Council heavily used USC , and many 'enhanced individuals' were turned out t o work for 'the cause' and proliferate, creating more new little Trojans. Those working for the New World Order saw \"the takeover\" wrapped up since the numbers would snowball each 20 to 25 y ears . My children would be destined to continue at a co llege or university that could 'further their enhancement.' The Council also knew how easily they could shape t he minds of the students at the university, since their minds w ere as yet uncluttered and they could teach them. These people were heavily into breeding and genetic bloodlines . They said things like, \"Hell, people pay more attention to breeding their horses and dogs than th ey do planning for their future progeny,\" and that, \"People in the project, however, have been fortunate enough to hav e that research and selective breeding done for the m, so their offspring will be of the highest quality. It's time we quit wasting precious space on this pl anet supporting inferior human life . It's time for a quality race to people this planet .\" This was the evolutionary step they saw. And the y felt that, \"since the common man can't think to bring ab out these changes on his own, we who are capable ar e left with the responsibility. Someone has got to do it, or we will be annihilated.\" \"Let us then approach the throne of grace with conf idence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.\" -- Hebrews 4:16   "},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":" Brice Taylor - Thanks for the Memories, pp 186-211 Chapter Twenty-five Baby Monarchs are Born Craig and I decided, at least I thought we decided, that it was important for me to take additional me ans of birth control to insure that we did not conceive a child while I was working to put Craig through dental sch ool. Dr. Stoddard referred me to Dr. Harold Lusk , a Hollywood OB/GYN who, on my first visit, examin ed me and told me not to worry, that my female reproductive organs were in such bad cond ition that I could never have children . I was so devastated that I couldn't talk, much less quest ion the doctor. I drove home numbed by the news. La ter that afternoon, sobbing through my words, I told my husb and that I would never be able to have children. Craig called Dr. Lusk immediately and was told that I had a disease called endometriosis, plus fibriod tumors and cysts, that the doctor explained were common in upp er and middle class women when they put off having children until later in life. I was only 22 years old! He to ld Craig that if he performed surgery on me it migh t be possible for me to get pregnant, but that we would have to start the process of trying to have a child, immediately . Over the next year, I had two major surgeries for what I was told was to correct the damage, and began the medical p rocess of dealing with what I was told was infertility. When, after the two so-called surgeries, I didn't get pr egnant, as a last resort, Dr. Lusk gave me a fertility drug called \"c lomid,\" and soon after, I became pregnant. I contin ued working as a dental assistant until I went into labor and gave birth to our first child, Kevin Craig Ford, on Oct ober 19, 1975. The Birth of Kevin Craig Ford Late at night, as my labor progressed, we were met at the hospital by a group of anxious hospital staf f. Craig phoned ahead alerting them that Susan Ford was on her way to the hospital. They thought I was Susan Ford, the President's daughter. I guess this was understandable due to th e fact that Nixon had stepped down and Gerald Ford was now President. They thought I might have twins, since I was so huge, but after an intense natural childbir th, Kevin was born and was immediately taken away from me for wha t seemed like a very long time. They told me it was standard procedure despite the fact that there were no compl ications. But later, suited men came into my hospit al room. One man took a syringe and some type of drug out of his briefcase and, while he was readying the injection for me, I began screaming, \"Where's my baby? Where's my husba nd? What did you do with my baby?\" As he injected a drug into my arm, he said in a cal m, emotionless voice, \"You see me but you don't see me. You can't see. You can't see me.\" Waiting a moment for the drug to take effect, he said, \"You need to calm down. . .just calm down. . . down. . . down. . . down. . . down.. . one ...two...three...going down ...deeper now ... going down. You're in the well, next to hell, and everything th at happens there, oh well, or is it oh hell? You're there.\" Taking my pulse, he continued, \" This is our baby. Don't ever forget, it belongs to us . You will hand him over when cued. You will not react. You will simply hand him over, like he is a sack of groceries. Do you unders tand? Nod your head if you understand.\" I nodded. \"Good, very good. This way no one will have to get hurt, we don't wan t that do we? \" I shook my head no. I felt very drugged. \"Good,\" the man said hypnotically. \" Bad things happen if you don't obey. Very bad things .\" I felt very sick, very tired, and very terrified. I couldn't breathe, I was too scared. \"They'll take my baby,\" I thought, terrified beyond words. Frantically I worried, \"Who will watch my baby, what are they doing to him? He lp, I can't get help. No one can hear. I can't talk, I can't te ll. THIS IS hell!\" Afterwards, of course, I couldn' t recall or think about any of this traumatic event. After a brief ho spital stay, Craig and I brought Kevin home and beg an trying to parent this baby who would not suckle at my breast and cried non-stop. I was programmed not to lock the doors to our home in Agoura and often men in suits let thems elves into our house . They always had guns and sometimes a knife . These men usually came in threes - one to handle and torture my baby, one to torture m e, and one to guard the door . The men said they had a \"little treat for the bab y.\" They went to Kevin's room and took him out of h is crib, where he was sleeping. They held Kevin in front of me and threatened me, with a gun pointed to my temp le. They"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"said that if I didn't cooperate they would cut his penis off, or slit his throat. At times they would cut him and make him bleed. Watching helplessly, as they hurt my baby, was the single worst nightmarish feeling and experience . I wanted my husband to help me. I wanted him to prote ct us, but he never did. Now, I understand that he never could. The men did different things each time they came to harass us. At times they took Kevin into another r oom and while they had him, another man restrained me. I st ood silently and helplessly while I tried to listen to what was happening to my baby. The agonizing silence was int ensely painful and was always followed, after what seemed like forever, with the screams of a crying baby in excruciating pain . God, the screams and the torturous crying were nearly unbearable to listen to. I was so helpless. I could not help myself, nor could I help my son. A nother time they asked me if I wanted to see a \"blue baby\" and then one of them proceeded to stick his thumb down my ba by's throat until he turned blue . The lead man always said that if I cooperated and did a better job, they would not have to subject my son to this. But they tortured us no mat ter how well I did my job. And, it is said that America is the land of the free and home of the brave. Where oh wh ere have we strayed, so far from the ideals set for th for this country? One day my infant son was swinging, peacefully soun d asleep in his wind-up swing, when they came. They threw a glass of water into Kevin's face to wake him up . He cried and the suited man picked him up and car ried him around the side of the garage out of my sight. Dying insid e, I waited anxiously, hoping they wouldn't hurt hi m again. After the silence came the horrifying crying and screams . The suited man carried him back, his baby bootie was off and blood was dripping all over. Holding a razor blade up to me, he said, \"Solve this problem my little cu tie.\" He handed me my screaming son, who was dripping with b lood . When they left, I took Kevin into the house and s at with him on the couch, sobbing, rocking him, and tr ying to stop the bleeding with a towel I wrapped ar ound his little foot. He cried so hard that he was sweating and sniffling, gasping for air and sobbed himself t o sleep. Our neighbor, Ron Peters , was one of Governor Ronald Reagan's bodyguards . He was usually around when I was used with Reagan in California, but didn't appe ar to be the lead man. I never knew when these men would barge into my home. Sometimes they even arrived in the middle of the night. When this occurred, I was programmed to walk to the front door and open it, a nd the men in suits would push their way in. They o ften pushed me into Kevin's room and closed the door. Craig alw ays slept and never woke up to protect us. It was a lways the same torture, horror and threats to both my baby an d me, and when they were finished they would leave. These hellacious experiences happened over and over and o ver again . At times, in those early years, there were instructions given over the phone in the middle of the night, but later on there was programming done that paired tones on the phone with different instructions. I r esponded robotically to the different tones I heard on the phone. A programmed part of me knew the instructions that ma tched the tones and knew just what they meant and h ow to respond. As my programming dictated, I robotically delivered my baby to my father's welding shop where I handed him over, probably for further trauma programming, and left. This kind of trauma, tied to my maternal instinct, was enough to keep all the programming intact. It k ept hidden the awareness of my use in high security work for the g overnment and other secret criminal activities I wa s involved in without my knowledge, consent, or awareness. In my conscious waking state as well as my sleeping hours , I was unable to think about what was happening to me and my family, but after Kevin was born I began to have excruciating migraine headaches. I also had stomach aches, colitis and constant pain in my female organ s. My body was expressing what I could not. My husband graduat ed from dental school and immediately set up a dent al practice on Topanga Canyon Boulevard in Woodland Hills. I co ntinued to work out of our house, doing dental lab work, so I could stay at home with our baby. I also began work ing part time at Craig's office. During the hours I worked away from home, Kevin was left at a babysitter's house i n the old neighborhood where I grew up in Woodland Hills. When he was out of diapers he filled a long-awaited slot at Little Oaks Preschool, in Thousand Oaks, C alifornia, where he, and later, the rest of my children were further ritually abused . The fact that I had put my baby on a preschool waiting list just weeks after he was born was not a detail I could reflect on. Nor, did the fact that I left him at the home of this babysitter who gave me a very d ark, gnawing eerie feeling that wouldn't go away, e ver hit me mentally. I could not, due to the mind control I wa s under, consciously think about any of this. Each year my husband and I would attend the America n Dental Association's annual convention, which was often held in Anaheim, California. In addition to the reg ular dental convention agenda, I was programmed to switch and then slip off to side rooms where I presented the l atest in mind control technology for the dentists w ho wanted to own the best assistants money could buy, complete w ith all the latest enhancements available. Then at night we"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"went to Disneyland. On several of these nights the park was closed to the public at large, in order to entertain the dentists and their families. Our controllers never missed an opportunity to combine functions so that they could accomplish two or more things at once. Of course, a t Disneyland my family and I were reprogrammed and reconditioned in order to preserve our high level p rogramming. Nothing was ever what it seemed and oft en there was an alternate agenda, a parallel reality going o n at the same time as a publicly acceptable event. Back in Agoura, there were nights I was triggered t o walk out of our home on Valley Heights Drive to t he waiting car of Secret Service agents or other men in suits in order to be flown to many different destinations . Clothes were always provided and were kept separate from those I wore at home, lest I gain access to my memory by t he sight of clothing I had worn on a \"government mission.\" Drugged My husband's dental training came in handy, as he w as adept at injecting my arm with drugs that our co ntrollers wanted me to have. There also were flat, round, cha lky tasting tablets, the size of Rolaids, that he g ave me at times before I was taken away by the Secret Service agent s. There were lots of drugs given to me orally and intravenously over the years and I never knew what they were, I s imply dissociated and complied when they were admin istered. Around this time, my husband announced that he had located a beautiful piece of property in an exclusi ve area of Agoura, called \"Old Agoura.\" Wanting to share his f ind with me he drove me down a little one-lane coun try road that led to a secluded dirt road. We entered a beau tiful rural area, dotted with huge oak trees everyw here and there was a beautiful stream that went through the land. Craig introduced me to Aaron Funk who was the owner of one whole side of the street. This stranger announced that he was hand selecting his neighbors for this exclusive area, and we were to be among them . This property was located less than a block from the entrance of Bob Hope's 2,324- acre Jordan Ranch. Within days, an agreement was st ruck, and although my husband was fresh out of dent al school, and our funds were extremely limited, he made a fin ancial deal with Mr. Funk to purchase the acre of l and for $78,000. This close proximity to Bob Hope's propert y factored into my family's abuse, heavily. (See ap pendix for map.) When I was to be used at parties - like at the Quee n Mary the night of a supposed dental party we atte nded where I was later taken away to service Bob Hope and Alan Cranston - first Craig put some liquid drug into my drink a nd I drank it as instructed, \"Drink it like a shooter, one gulp and it's down.\" Then Craig gave me some d rug from a plastic bag that he pulled out of his suit pocket. He took the white powdery substance and wet it on a mirror, put the liquid into a syringe and injected it into my arm. At different times, he gave me shots in a variety o f places - my arms, thighs, hip and buttocks. Sometimes he tied a rubber tourniquet very tightly around my arm befor e he gave me the injection. These injections hurt sometimes, especially the ones in my lower arms near my wrist. Sometimes he would try to use veins there and the shots reall y stung. My husband was an expert in laying out thi s drug paraphernalia in preparation for readying me for an event. He knew my arm like a road map and where to hit the good veins. A man in a suit frequently delivered a supply of th e drugs to our house, intended for me . He left it high in the top corner of the garage, taped to the wall. I saw Craig retrieve it from that location on a nu mber of occasions. My husband also injected me before porn was filmed . They were still using me in porn in my 30's . Craig injected me, just before my use, oftentimes when I was in so meone else's car ready to be taken to my assignment . If one of the kids came up at that time, he would yell at the m to get back in the house. Sometimes there was a c ertain smell to certain drugs, almost like sulfur. When porn was fi lmed in the dental office, \"Dr. Ford\" injected me o r gave me some tablet or wafer to eat, beforehand. I don't kn ow what the deciding factor was as to whether the d rug was given interveniously or orally, but I sat in the dental c hair and watched as my husband mixed up the powder on the dental tray, liquidized it, placed the liquid into a syrin ge and then shot it into my arm. Only then could th ey start the porn. I was always drugged before filming pornography. As our children grew older, they also were drugged before they were used . While retrieving some of these drugged memories, I didn't feel any emotions. It was as if I was just a \"doll\" and not real. Rag doll is a very common prog ram theme among female slaves. Bob used to refer to me as his doll. It took two years after retrieving these drug memories before I could actually begin to feel the pain and betrayal of this act performed, unconsciously, but still, by my own husband. And, until I had a suffic ient amount of memories of our early cross-programming, I could on ly see my husband as a perpetrator, and not as the victim of the same evil system that he truly was."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" The Birth of Our Second Mind Controlled Child Bob Hope's \"Little Filly\" and George Bush's \"Bush B aby\" In 1977 we decided, or it was decided for us, that it was time to have a second child. I kept saying I wanted to go to Maui to conceive this second child after dental sch ool. Actually, our controllers had planned it all. Craig and I arrived on Maui and he told me to dress for dinner. Being in the mood to celebrate, Craig made us a Ha waiian cocktail in our hotel suite. It tasted like a combi nation of a Mai Tai and a Pina Colada, and it must have been drugged. I drank the drink as we watched the beauti ful Maui sunset from our balcony. Then I went into our bedroom and dressed in a beautiful clingy, long pur ple dress and we went out as my husband had told me I thought to dinner. Instead of what I thought was going to b e a lobster dinner, I ended up staying in a hospita l for a few days. In fact, I was flown from the island in a helicopte r, with a facemask on through which I was breathing some kind of drug, to a hospital where they did something to me (I believe Kelly was genetically engineered) and I was in this hospital for awhile. The doctors wore green surgica l scrubs and did something to me vaginally. I don't know exactly what. They had test tubes, the glass kind that were very long and slender, and they looked at each oth er over their green facemasks. They didn't speak out loud but the ir eyes looked very serious. I had an IV in my left arm that was tied to a board with cotton and gauze around it. Af ter that night I became deathly ill, severely nause ated, and I don't really remember much else that happened on that tri p. When Craig finally picked me up after they finished with me, they had me dress once again in my purple dress, and then Craig took me to the awaited lobster dinner. A t that time there was a switch in my personality sy stem and I didn't (couldn't) consciously know what had transpi red. But that is how I really got pregnant with Kel ly. Craig and I weren't allowed to have sex for awhile, but were al lowed to as they said, \"enjoy it in your mind.\" Kel ly was the classic blonde, blue-eyed prototype, with large che ekbone structure, and all the right things they wan ted for her to be sexual. Years later, Sylvester Stallone would comment that Kelly looked to him like a little 'Bo Derek .' The UCLA doctors were in correspondence with other doct ors on Maui. When I got pregnant with Kelly on Maui in June of 1977, they monitored this conception heavily . When we returned to the mainland, I found out I w as actually pregnant. I began spotting and my doctor recommende d I go to bed, which I did for a few days until the spotting ceased. Kelly has a personality named Papaya, in ho nor of, and use for, Hawaiian experiences. As I rem embered this experience, in obedience with my programming, my heart started racing and I felt like I was havin g a heart attack. Our daughter, Kelly Suzanne Ford was born on February 23, 1978 , and from then on Kevin wasn't always the main focus of the torturous trauma - Kelly was . The torture and trauma began right after her birth . While we were still in Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys, Californi a, three men in suits came into the hospital room a nd closed the door. They took my new baby girl out of her bassine t, held her up and put a pistol to her head. Anothe r man put a gun to my head and the third man stood guard at the hospital room door. The man holding the gun to my head said, \"If you fail to follow our instructions, just one t ime...\" he clicked the gun, but nothing happened, \" we will just have to kill this precious little one.\" Then the man hol ding Kelly took a wad of Kleenex off my hospital tr ay, wadded it up and put it into the glass of water on my tray in order to wet it. He held my precious baby girl fac ed downward and forced the wad of wet Kleenex into her mouth, i nterfering with her ability to breathe. With a gun to my head, I watched in absolute horror and terror, as my baby girl choked and gagged and then went limp in the man's arms . I thought she was dead. Then he said, \"That's all it takes. It's as simple and easy as that.\" He took Kelly into the bathroom and did something to r evive her because she was breathing again, and bega n crying loudly. The man literally threw her into my arms an d said, \"Mama, your baby is crying, maybe she's hun gry.\" Then, they forced me to breastfeed her in front of them w hile they watched and then they left. The hospital nurse never knew they were there and since I was programmed, I was unable to think or remember it had happened so that I could get help. That was one of Kelly's first life experiences - one of her first birth traumas. As an aside, I will share with you the reader, that as I sought recovery and understanding of what was wrong with me, I attended groups for people suffering with Mul tiple Personality Disorder. It was an enlightening time of new understanding as I met and shared with other Multip les, some who were RN's, intensive care nurses and therapists also attempting to heal. It leads me to wonder if some of the nurses and doc tors in the hospital who attended the birth of my children were themselves programmed and controlled ? In one particular Christian group I attended for"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Multiples who had been ritually abused, in the open ing prayer, an MPD'd, ritually abused nurse prayed for the Lord to heal one of us so we could expose this atrocity and get help for the others . As she made her request, I knew it would be me that would heal and go for help. I healed as fast as I could , but help didn't come as quickly as I would have liked. When Kelly turned three months old, our family move d into a large doublewide portable home on the rece ntly purchased Chesebro Road property in Old Agoura, whe re we began life as \"chosen\" neighbors. Soon we had an architect draw up plans to build a large two-story home. The open, undeveloped area provided access to our family in many ways. Aaron Funk moved away and we were lef t on the street with only one neighbor. Helicopters could land in the adjacent area, and Bob Hope's Jordan Ra nch would later be used for countless encounters; n one of them were pleasant. Our lives went on and, as programmed , I dutifully delivered my little daughter to Point Mugu Naval Weapons Base in California where military men took her from my arms wrapped in a beautiful pink blanket my mother knit for her. They kept her for a long while and then brought her back out to me . Sometimes when they needed to have one of my children for programming I was instructed to park my car on Las Virgenes Road , just past Agoura Road, and the men in suits picked us up and drove us the rest of the way to Point Mugu. As Kelly grew a little older, at around age two our programmers laid her by my side on a gurney where we were both hooked up to sensors all over our bodies - hea d, chest, and pulse points (wrist and neck artery), in order to monitor something. What exactly, I don't know. The men working on us wore surgical greens so I assumed they were doctors. Kelly and I were drugged and totally out of it. I watched as my little baby daughter's e yes rolled up in her head like she was convulsing. Sometimes they pu t a mask over our faces to further drug us or injec ted drugs into our forearms and sometimes there was even an IV bot tle left to drip for us both. There was one IV bott le, with the tubing split into two, one for me and one for Kelly . They also hooked us up to sounds delivered throug h earphones and often added bright lights. It felt like they pr ogrammed Kelly and I through sound and light by hoo king us both up to wires. It seemed like we were getting a blood transfusion , but we were connected to wires instead of tubes and there was no blood . There were also water experiments. They put me into a metal ball with a door and plunged me into the w ater, spun it and immersed it deeply. It was hard to tell what was going on from my position inside. It was very dark and very confining. I just pretended I was somewhere on the beach until it was over. If I had to guess, I would say they were doing experiments and research on the mind and the brain. Sometimes we were encapsulated and were weig htless. There were all different sorts of chairs; some were for electroshock. One had a headrest with a band o n it and straps for our wrists and straps for our ankles. They would zap me, and Kelly would be in the same k ind of chair facing me and then they would zap her . It was horrific to watch her being tortured. They would have to almost carry her off when it was through because she was so out of it. T he electroshock was usually the last thing they did . But before the electroshock, sometimes we were subjected to virtual reality machines , like moving rides we entered with a video screen showing pictures with lights and sound . After we were in it for awhile, they took us out and tested us with EEG and EKG equipment and asked us to fill out questionnaires, or they would ask us to write down the answers to questions they casually wrote down. The questions were related to what we had just seen, ho w we experienced it, and how we felt or there were quest ions about different personalities within us; maybe they were checking our programming or our inner systems. There were other machines we entered where the floo r tilted while our feet were tied down and we'd lea n over, and sometimes there were mirrors where we looked distor ted. There was lots of virtual reality equipment. O ne apparatus was a helmet with front eyeglasses attached with wi res all over. They placed it on me and I saw a visu al of lightening striking the top of my head while I was feeling electroshock to the top of my head. Then I heard the words, \"You feel no pain. Hit by a bolt of lightnin g yet you feel no pain.\" After all this they tested me neurologically to see if I could walk, touch my nos e, etc. Once I was tied inside a big roller and, wi th hands and feet tied spread eagle, they spun it real fast and then took me out. Kelly wasn't always there, but she was present more often than I care to remember. I remember the two o f us laying next to each other on the gurney with t owels over our bodies, IV's in our arms, with glasses and gogg les on and we were totally drugged. There was a dol phin tank at Point Mugu , with an underwater window where they could watch as we swam with the dolphins. Swimming with the dolphins usually signaled the end of it. After that, we were returned to our car that was parked s omewhere in Agoura or in the canyon. I thought United States military officials were sup posed to be in service to protect and defend their country and its citizens . Where are the high ranking men of honor that protec t and defend the women and children in this country? What has go ne wrong?"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" Genetic Engineering Soon after I had finished breastfeeding Kelly in 19 79, I continued to have severe pain in my female re productive organs that no one seemed to be able to help me wit h or understand the origin of. Dr. Galloway , the doctor that delivered Kelly, admitted me to Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys, California. Late in the day I was assigned a hospital bed and understood that my doct or had ordered a D & C for me. He explained that th is was standard operating procedure. Later on, I was taken into surgery, a mask was put over my face, and I w as anesthetized with some sort of gas. It was nighttim e when they performed this procedure on me that was n't a real D & C; they really took my ovum for in vitro fertiliz ation with other genetic strains. \"Ideal genes, fro m healthy stock,\" they said. I cannot identify the doctors who were d oing this to me. Before I became pregnant with Kevin, they had taken other ovum during times when I was previously hosp italized for so-called \"surgery.\" They thought I couldn't he ar, but I could hear and see what they were doing. I was out-of- body and could hear and see everything they did . Their perception of reality seemed to be limited to the physical world. They didn't yet understand that a person cou ld be out-of-body, that it is possible to take your consciousness out of your body to see and experience events in ot her locations. While my body was lying on the opera ting table under anesthesia, from my out-of-body position over head, I could see their side of the table with equi pment they used to take my ovum and a special dish with a spec ial solution that they used to put the ovum in. Imm ediately upon placement of the ovum into the dish, a nurse came i n and quickly took it away somewhere. This is genetic engineering. These people do this a lot - they stea l women's ovum to experiment on . They take good genetic stock. This is why, later on, I wanted a hysterectomy; sub consciously, I wanted to stop what they were doing. I recorded in my memory files what I overheard the doctors say that night in the operating room: \" Her children by her husband are inferior to those created here . We can team this ovum up with superior sperm to cre ate a superior genus . These children will one day rule the world and we w ill be able to weed out the weaker genetic strains . Room must be made for this advanced race. The plan has been carefully orchestrated. It will come about with \"our strains\" in leadership. We have chosen the genetic strains o f leaders, those whose drive is to lead, and to tha t end we have \"strained in\" health, intellect, and leadership qua lities. These children will be raised in isolation, like th e leaders in the shadows and will be taught advanced skills from birth meditation, diet, emotion modulation, and wi ll be fed a strict diet of higher knowledge . The rulers of the future will be elite in every way , shape and form . We have spliced her genetic health and intellect strains with those perfect physical forms of the intellect donor to c reate the perfect species - both male and female. These strains will rise to the top . The forms will be so advanced that the normal human species will not be able to compete, and so ours will be the elite - the ruling class - and the lower forms will be the so-called worker-bees . There is no way the normal man can compete. Ours is the elite. We will soon have enough of our people grown and implanted with our direction and our wisdom, and no w that we know how to program their minds from birt h, we will have total and complete control . They will be ours - a race - a genus we can be prou d of, created from the best genetic structure on earth. \" They said, \" The future on earth belongs to the scientists. It i s time we weed out the inferior races .\" Under the direction of my doctors, I mindlessly and compulsively charted a graph of my temperature to know when I was ovulating. Now I understand why that was so i mportant. They even did an experiment of combining my genes with those of my husband's best friend and colleagu e. On one occasion, while he was performing so-call ed \"oral surgery,\" while I was under anesthetic, they had him mount me to impregnate me . Then, I was instructed to report to UCLA where they took the sperm-fertilized egg from my u terus . They compared which genetic structure was superior - between those created in vitro and those created by a natural union and then taken from the body to mature. This determination to create a 'superior race' is, as you may remember, the same drive that fueled Hit ler's regime in Germany . One needs only to read Linda Hunt's book, Secret Agenda: The United States Government , Nazi Scientists, and Project Paperclip, and then vi sit the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC, in orde r to put two and two together. If you observe some of the pictur es of innocent people in the concentration camps as they are being used for brain and behavior experimentation, it's easy to ascertain that more was occurring than just the torture of innocent Jewish people for religious or racial purposes. This experimentation was also done intentionally in order to further the understanding of the mind a nd body, and how people could be controlled."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":" We as a people have not fully embraced the reality of the horrors in Germany that were perpetrated on victims there, and to that end we allow it to continue to the pres ent, as those who should have been prosecuted for t heir war crimes often went free. As a matter of fact, through Project Paperclip , many were brought to our country by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was our own intelligence apparatus at the ti me. They were placed in our major universities and hospitals to continue their uncons cionable scientific research . It was through the invaluable wizardry of one of these Project Paperclip Nazis, General Reinhard Gehlen (German Intelligence Specialist), that our fledgling CIA came into being just after World War Il, and the \"Cold War\" was born. Len Horowitz , in his book Emerging Viruses: Aids and Ebola - Nature, Accident or Intentional ? points to a linkage between Henry Kissinger and General Alexander Bolling . He mentions that Gen. Bolling played a major role in Project Paperclip as well as the Joint Inte lligence Committee, a newly formed administrative u nit that recruited former Nazi scientists expert in mind con trol. Their combined research activity soon led to classified projects that paved the way for the CIA's Project M KULTRA. Horowitz also links Kissinger to oversight of project MKNAOMI , a military program to develop biological weapons having genocidal application . The Rockefellers, who spearheaded a national euge nics movement, supported research activities of similar nature to Project MKULTRA and MKNAOMI through their pre-WWII funding of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute whose director was, at one time, Joseph Mengele's superior. As you may remember, Mengele conducted horrific medical experiments at Auschwitz , many that were related to mind control. All of these facts are discussed in Horowitz's meti culously documented work. From reading I did after I reintegrated and deprogrammed, I began to understand that the ne wly created CIA and the Rockefellers with all of th eir money and foundations, carefully researched and hired top former Nazi scientists to carry on their personal belief in creating a \" master (Aryan) race.\" They are doing so through mind control experimenta tion and genetics research in systems within the confines of carefully whitewashe d hospital or university research facilities, not t o mention military bases. The Holocaust has not ended, it has just gone underground, and the victims are silent due to the mind control they have been put under. I believe these scientists have fallen short in the ir understanding that, while the physical, genetic structure a baby is born with is very important, God in His perfection has patterned a life for this child. When this is a ltered by human intervention, it no longer can serve the highest pu rpose for the child's lifetime. It is not just the physical structure that rules a life of a child. A 'soul' is born into the body, and if left to the natural order of God in His infinite wisdom, there is a higher agenda and purpose to be accomplished. How can man in his finite wisdom begin to believe that he can out-create the Creator? I don't believe that physical perfection is the mai n goal here. Scientists will forever be lost in their own egos u ntil they realize the absolute divine and perfectiv e nature of God. Dental Office Money Laundering Schemes Arnold Stengle was our first accountant, but was re placed by Bruce Frank who was an accountant from Soquel, California. He directed me how to handle the dental office books from his Northern California office, and visited our office every now and then in order to further d irect me. To give me instructions, he would sit acr oss from me at my little office in the back. I would put my hands up to my head, my elbows to my knees and in \"ready and alert\" program stance, I would listen as programmed to \"ev ery word spoken.\" And he always had lists upon lists of 4digit number series. I don't know what they meant, but I would rattle them off later to different people, es pecially Reagan . I also was programmed to report to different banks in the area . One was Safra Bank in Woodland Hills. On a typical day I went to the Safra Bank undergrou nd parking and when I entered the parking lot I was programmed to switch to Sharon. Then I went into th e bank. When I entered the bank a man in a suit was waiting and gestured for me to go to a woman teller. I did as instructed and handed her the envelopes that two men had just given me in the underground parking lot. I never kn ew exactly what was in the envelopes, but when the teller opened them there were usually checks and cash. Whe n the transaction was completed, I drove back to th e office, switched now to Susan, and not having a clue that I had just been used to perform an illegal banking t ransaction for my controllers. Years later when I filed for divorc e, my California attorney , Doug Wolfe , told me to go sign papers at Safra Bank before the divorce could go through.

Repeatedly she was tortured and traumatized in fr ont of me in an effort to keep me in line. Her tort ure fragmented her psyche in order to create multiple p ersonalities within her, so she could follow in my footsteps for later use as a \"presidential model.\" Unfortunately, she didn't have to wait very long for that so-call ed \"privilege\" as our newly elected Vice President at the time, George Bush , was/is a pedophile and Kelly was created to be, as I later found out from a renegade CIA operative, what was called a \" Bush Baby.\" Barbara Bush brought snacks in on a tray to the delight of the c hildren clustered around her husband . The kids munched on animal cookies with sprinkles on top as they listened to the Vice President read them stori es. The reality created and the accompanying program he del ivered was, \"You are what you read.\" This was durin g the time they lived in the house with the flat rock fireplac e. The fireplace had a stone bench that you could s it on in front of the fireplace and George had his easy chair near it . There was a brown coffee table and a couch, and h unting pictures of Springer Spaniels holding birds in thei r mouths and pointing, graced the walls. George was into that sort of stuff. Barbara thought I was there as a represen tative of the new educational system being implemen ted in California, which was true, although I wasn't consc iously aware of it, and she was told that the child ren were there to demonstrate to the Vice President just how well the new system was working. But later, when the demonstration was over , Bush would take Kelly or another small child to the bathroom or to \"show them something special .\" During the time the Vice President disappeared with my daughter, Barbara often made lots of small talk , always smiling, cheery and pleasant, speaking nothing of i mportance. She talked a lot, especially when her husband was o ut of the room . I was on edge, even under mind control, as parts of me sensed that my little girl was being hurt. Th e connection between mother and child often makes phy sical presence unnecessary to know the status of on e's child, and it was difficult to carry on small talk with Mr s. Bush while my child was being raped. The Vice Pr esident brought Kelly back when he was finished. She looked dazed and out of it. Bob Hope arranged many other times for George to be with Kelly in different and more private settings. There was a weekend retreat home the Bush's went to in the mo untains, so they could relax, and George would take their dog out hunting wild fowl. Barbara stayed inside and ba ked and did needlepoint, like a typical housewife. I believe that she was unaware that her husband was molesting drov es of little girls. George always said he had a spe cial place in his heart for little girls. Bob Hope Utilizes His Little Filly Asset When Kelly was brought to Bob's parties, he gave her as a gift to known pedophiles that like d little girls . Then, he really owned these men . He would act like he really thought it was okay t o have sex with a child, to men he knew were pedophiles. Without actually saying it in word s, he portrayed that attitude and then after the pe rson had raped the child he would say something like, \"Do you know what news like this could do to your career?...to your family?\" At the parties, these children were kept in a back room . On nights I was programmed to act as 'the hostess ,' I was instructed to escort men back to the room whe re the children waited for this expressed purpose. I was even programmed to facilitate their choice in which chil d they wanted for the evening. Sometimes, acting fr om program, I even offered my own daughter to these men. Kelly was brought to Bob's on nights when men who had \"yo unger preference\" were in attendance. Bob used that term with people like George Bush. When Kelly was nearly three years old she was provided to George Bush to satisfy his pedophile desires. Bob invited a group of men with \"younger preferences,\" and later provided them with a group of children, both male and female, for the ir pleasure. With people he really wanted to own or use he would take pictures of the molestation with hidd en cameras . He knew just how to get to these people. Then afterwar ds he would show them a picture of the rape of the child and say, \"We sure don't want these pictures, or any oth ers like these to get into the wrong hands and ruin your entire career, do we?\" Then he would simply tell the man w hat he wanted, in exchange for impunity. It usually had to do with getting another \"friend\" of his into a \"key\" p osition in the government , looking the other way when a case came down, or getting a bill passed or vetoed . He knew just how to control these men and they us ually complied. In 1993 as I was attempting to get free and get my fir st book published, due to the fact that I was not c ooperating and"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"\"staying in line,\" I was raped and then forced, und er mind control, to pose for pictures that if shown to others would have totally discredited me, making me look like a perpetrator. In this type of scenario, the media is called in an d a person is publicly discredited -- end of threat ! Back in the 60's and 70's I watched as people in po sitions of authority were set up and compromised in the same manner in order that they could be used. And in the 90's I watched with horror, as many of t he dedicated individuals who were attempting to end this abuse and help the victims, were publicly discredited , often via mainstream media channels. Hunted by Bush on Hope's Jordan Ranch George Bush was one of the men in safari uniform on Bob Hope's property who hunted me when Kelly was little. Bob was laughing when he laid down the rules. \"Ther e will be no running, or hiding, you will simply st roll along the path, skipping, if you like, dancing if you wis h, but NO running, until you are TRAPPED. It's inev itable, there is no escaping it, especially with an expert hunter li ke George.\" Looking me in the eye, Bob said, \"Are t here any questions?\" I shook my head no. \"Good, then remembe r, every step you take may be your last.\" As a heli copter touched down off in the distance in this rural Jord an Ranch area, Bob said, \"Bush will be coming from a different angle.\" I walked down the road, which with every st ep I took, became more and more like The Yellow Bri ck Road that I had been programmed since childhood to follo w. I was absolutely terrified, waiting to be attack ed, killed. . . whatever; I didn't know what they had in store for me this day. I walked for a long time and it felt l ike I was hallucinating along the way. In my mind, playing ov er and over like a horror movie were Bob's words, \" Every step you take may be your last.\" In my blue jeans and red checkered shirt, I kept wa lking. I was still walking when it got dark and I w as really scared then because I was so far away from where I had beg un. My arm ached from the injection they had given me in the bend of my arm and I rubbed it wishing I wasn't so alone in the world. I was getting frantic, totally panicked by now and I just kept walking. Nothing seemed real anymor e. I felt like a caged animal and I couldn't rememb er the rules any longer. I was trying so hard to remember exactl y what Bob had said, thinking if I just did it righ t that I wouldn't get hurt and my children would be safe. But my drug ged terror was escalating, and I couldn't think any more, I felt like I was losing control. After what seemed like a very long time, George Bush stepped out from an old outhouse - type structure that was on Bob's ranch and calmly w alked over to me, \"Betcha didn't think I'd ever be hiding in there, did ya?\" and he laughed. \"Well, I like to pl ay hide and seek a lot but there's only two of us h ere so let's play another game that only requires two, the two of us. \" I nodded, frozen in terror. \"I just happen to have an apple. A beautiful red ap ple here in my pocket.\" He pulled the apple out and said, \"I know the game is supposed to be played with a bow and ar row (I'd been accidentally shot with an arrow in th e jaw when I was five) but I forgot mine. I did remember however to bring my revolver.\" And he pulled a gun out of his other pocket . \"Now, this game is called William Tell, and you g et to play William. Here, you stand over here, so i f I miss, the bullet will go into the tree instead of traveli ng wildly out of control.\" He placed me in front of an oak tree and put the apple on top of my head. By now I was cryin g. I couldn't help it, I just couldn't control it. \" Please don't hurt my kids anymore ,\" I begged. Bush said, \"Shhh, don't interrupt. We're playing a game now . Now just stand real still and remember your name is William Tell, and this is what happens if you don't .\" Slowly, he cocked the gun and took aim at the ap ple on my head or me, I couldn't tell which. Then, taking his time he said very slowly as he took aim, \"Ok are y ou ready for the games to begin? Will you tell?\" I squeezed my e yes shut and he lowered the gun as he sighed real d isgustedly, \"No, no, you can't close your eyes, you have to see this coming, otherwise it won't be any fun at all. \" So, I opened my eyes and George took aim again and said, \"Rememb er this is what happens if you don't TELL.\" He kept aiming and re-aiming trying to get it just right and then he asked me again if I was ready. \"Yes, Sir,\" I ans wered. He put the gun down to listen to me, then took aim again, \" Now what's the magic message ?\" \"Don't tell,\" I answered. Immediately, he fired and shot the apple off my head. It blasted a hole in the middle of it and blew out a huge chunk and he walked over, picked it up off the ground and said, \"Looks like we both won this time . You wait for your ride, I'll take mine another way,\" and he disappeared. "},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"I tried to see where he went in the dark but I coul dn't locate him. Shortly after, a couple of cowboys that tended the cattle on Bob's ranch came driving by in their old pick up truck and angrily said, \"Get in, we'll give you a ride back to the end of the road. You're trespassing lady.\" S o I climbed into the back of their pick up truck, n ot even on the seat in the cab and bounced all the way back to the end of the road. Then, I walked the short distance home. When I walked in the house, Craig said, \"Where have you be en? I got dinner started and was getting worried.\" \"Oh, I was over at the neighbor's,\" I answered, falling into l ine helping with the kids and the dinner. During di nner, I just wanted to hold Kelly, who was two years old, and ke pt feeling so glad she was safe, at least for now. I kept rocking her at the dinner table and it was a good thing my daughter was in my lap or I probably would have app eared as I really was, \"psychotically experiencing an episode. \" That's what they told me the doctors would say if I went to them for help. \"They'll say you're psychotic,\" Bob said, \"and it won't take them long to figure it out . It will be obvious.\" George Bush lorded and ruled over me for years once I had children. There were lots of scary program tactics they installed to insure the safety of his use of Kelly and me. Mission Assignment on Maui An early experience of cross-programming with Kelly took place in order for me to be used with newly e lected President Ronald Reagan and Kelly with Vice Preside nt George Bush, on Maui. My pedophile father, Calvi n Eckhart, paid for my husband, young children, and I to vacation with him and my mother to Hawaii. This was a trip to the island of Maui in 1981 where I was taken fro m my family to be of service to my country, to serv e President Reagan and others. Before the trip Bob Hope checked Kelly out at a distance. My father took us to a pu blic park in Reseda, California and, although at the time he was very physically debilitated, he gave Bob a hand si gnal as we passed by. Bob looked at Kelly and gave my father a wink and a thumbs-up sign and we left. Like all these \"missions\" before, I was totally amn esiac of this occurrence and could not remember muc h of what happened at all during the vacation. At the time, I did not realize I couldn't remember what happened on the vacation. It was only years afterwards that awarene ss was available to me. Then, the only thing I coul d recall about this trip was having dinner at the Charthouse on Fr ont Street, in Lahaina with my parents, husband and children. I remembered that my five-year-old son Kevin ordered lobster, and that was all I could remember about th at trip until years later when I returned to Maui without my fami ly in 1991. Then the memories of that earlier trip began flooding back as I sat under the large mango tree l ocated in front of the same place I had been taken to be with Reagan - the Puamana. It all began like it had every other time before. T hree men in suits barged into our hotel room where my family was sleeping and took Kelly and I out of the room. She was 2'/2 years old. Then they took us to another ro om and tortured us both in front of one another, programme d in some instructions for me, and then they took m e away. At that time I didn't know where they took Kelly. The personalities inside of me that were programmed for use with Reagan and others on this trip never knew what happ ened to my children during that time. The personali ties I had that performed everyday, mundane, routine jobs, wer e amnesiac to the whole experience-they never knew it happened. Such is the reality of Multiple Personali ty Disorder and mind control through trauma-based programming. I overheard my controllers speak among st themselves explaining that the Puamana was specially selected for security purposes and had the advantag e that it could be accessed by both land and sea . Seaplanes could secretly fly in foreign dignitaries at night. It wa s a gate-guarded complex that was easily protected by the Secret Service, insuring secrecy and privacy. I was on Maui for a ten-day stay, supposedly to vac ation with my family, and was used part of the time as a go- between with Reagan and many other politicians and foreign dignitaries. During the time at the Puamana , my job was to help make Ron and Nancy more comfortable. I researched restaurants and places to order food and did everything I was told to do to help them, in additi on to being the \"secretary\" for mind files use at t heir meetings and later having sex with Reagan. I took shorthand, but more importantly could secretly \"record\" everythin g I heard and saw for later debriefing by Kissinger or the Counci l. Nancy could see that I had a credible job, but w hen she would say anything accusatorily about me, Reagan would de ny it and tell her she was just over-reacting and h e would kiss her very lovingly on the cheek. All in all, she was not pleased that I was there. She was angry and un pleasant to me. She hated it when I was around. I hated it when she was around too; everyone was on guard because of h er attitudes. Reagan occasionally spoke to me about he r as if she was unreasonable, but mostly he would d efend her, saying she was probably just a little tired or cran ky."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" I liked it when Ronnie (that's what he told me to c all him when we were alone) and I walked on the bea ch in the dark together, as there was no one to interrupt us. Nancy never knew where we \"really\" were because Ro nnie would tell the Secret Service agents to tell her that he was going to be in a meeting. They were instructed to keep an eye on her and make sure she stayed inside the room for sa fety, since it was dark outside. Reagan told them h e would need me to be at the meeting, as I was functioning as hi s secretary at certain times and he would need my h elp. Then we would go off together to \"do business.\" Sometimes w e did do business, but more often we would go off a lone together and I would give him my \"undivided sexual attention.\" I also gave him any information I was i nstructed and preprogrammed to give to him from the Council a nd others. Once elected, Ronnie said to me, \"Can yo u believe I'm President now? Does it feel any different to yo u to be here with me?\" He often complained about hi s job and how hard it was. That seemed to be where I translat ed his words to mean, \"Please baby me, pamper me, t ake care of me, coddle me,\" and I did just that. Whatever he wa nted or needed, I was programmed to perform for him . I was assigned a room on the beachfront at Puamana. The room was actually just another one of his room s a place where they took me to be alone with him. The Secret Service agents acted like they did not see or were not watching, but sometimes I would notice them snicker ing or smiling at things I did with Reagan. The Council told me what to do, when to do it, what words to use and what to say later on in the evening to have the gr eatest impact on Reagan . I don't think he ever knew I was being \"an actress \" - doling out the lines I had been programmed to deliver - but he loved it! So did Tricky Dick (Nixon). These tactics worked especially well on old men, a nd that is exactly what these men were. This late night rendezvous at the Puamana, in the l ittle pool overlooking the ocean, I bounded out of the pool and began unfastening my bikini top. I took it off and began dancing, slinging it around like I had been t rained to do, as I sang, \"Let me entertain you,\" like I had done for Bob Hope. Reagan was laughing and a bit embarrasse d, I guess because of the Secret Service's presence, but he di dn't stop me. I slowly pulled off my bikini bottom, danced around more and then slipped back into the pool next to hi m, naked. This personality, specially created and d evoted to Reagan, was very comfortable being naked. I never e ven considered picking up my bikini afterwards. As I climbed out of the pool, Reagan put a large beach towel aro und me and the Secret Service agents picked up my w et bikini and brought it inside. The Secret Service agents were usually younger than the Presidents and I could see in their faces that I had their respect and admiration, but was confused as to why. Sometimes after these antics, they would have a li ttle grin on their faces. The words that went with these little acts were not political, but were used by the Counc il to entertain and bring Reagan closer to me, to make him want me. They figured if he wanted to be with me, they coul d use me to slip important messages to him later on after se x, upon awakening or in the evening when he was jus t dozing off to sleep. The Council knew that, if they could keep him interested and pampered over the years, they c ould maintain control over him. I was programmed to make him feel good. I did every thing he wanted and helped soothe him when he was t roubled or distressed, and I even had some opinions that he was surprised I was \"old enough\" to have. Presiden t Reagan said I was, \"wise beyond my years,\" but he never did kno w that I wasn't really--I just had the Council pre- empting me. I would say that I was so interested in his success a nd the success of our nation that I read up on thin gs in the newspaper and got a new \"idea\" or perspective after my research. Or, I would say that an idea just cam e to me. I don't believe he knew just exactly to what extent I was being set up for him. The Council knew just what would make a man happy, and more importantly they studied exactly what each man specifically liked or dislik ed . Newly elected Vice President George Bush was at the Puama na for this trip, also. He and Reagan were having a ll sorts of leaders secretly flown in by seaplane to the back o f the complex in the middle of the night. My job wa s to go and greet many of them as they arrived and help them to their rooms in the dark. Some were foreign ambassa dors. They had meetings with these men and had a formal gather ing one evening in the large banquet room that was used for parties. It was decorated in red, white, and blue, as it was soon after Reagan and Bush had been elect ed and many of the foreign dignitaries were congratulating them. I overheard Reagan and Bush talking before the part y and Bush told Reagan that this was an important n ight to lay the groundwork for future negotiations with certain foreign countries. These leaders were flown in, sp ent a couple of days and were flown back out. The men from Saudi Arabia had to be flown in on separate days because I"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"overheard them saying that they would not \"mix\" wit h the other guests . No one spoke of them afterwards to any of the other guests. They wore their white robes or na tive dress and were mostly dark-skinned. George Bush seemed like the leader as far as these negotiations went and I noticed that Reagan \"leaned on him\" heavily for guidance and instruction. Bush had done his homework and studied the situations and Reagan took his expert advice. Although I don't remember Kissinger being present for this meeting, at other times, Rea gan also took advice from Kissinger. George Bush pounced on me wh en I least expected it, often delivering a devastat ingly terrifying cryptic message while I was speaking to some foreign ambassador or politician at a White Ho use function, gala, ground breaking, or golf with Hope. But this time we were on Maui at the newly-elected President's dinner. He waited until no one was around and then said, \"I don't know what the President sees in you. He must have on some of those strange Elton John glasses, t hat make you look otherworldly like a little green Martian.\" Later at night, I was told to stand out at the beac h and wait until I was signaled with a flashing lig ht and then I was instructed to swim out through the surf to the sail ing vessel. A man aboard the big white sailing vess el took me aboard and into a darkened room below where a man s itting in the dark delivered a message to me, \" You are to tell Reagan it's a green light . It's a go . And tell Bush to keep his dirty mitts off this one .\" Then he laughed and said, \" No instead say , ' George , the men on high say that they have got this one cov ered. Anything you do would only interfere in the master plan.\" ' Then he said, \"You may go now. Take flight and de liver your messages on cue.\" I walked robotically out of the room and over to th e area on the boat where there wasn't a railing, do ve off and swam back to the beach. The Council maintained vigi lant contact with Reagan especially during this tri p. Reagan was aware that I swam to get information because he commented that it turned him on when I swam to my assignment. I swam often and had programming that a llowed me to swim long distances without tiring. Th is swim program was often tied to 'dolphin themes' in my co nscious mind so, in case I began to remember, my th oughts were automatically directed to thinking about how m uch I loved dolphins. These are the words that dire cted my swim programming: \"Your body is warm as you glide t hrough the water, swimming easily, effortlessly, en dlessly through the ocean, like a dolphin. Dolphins deliver messages, and so will you.\" Other times I swam out from the beach and waited to hear the sound of a helicopter, and like the dolphin waiting below the spaceship i n the movie Cocoon, I waited to be \"beamed up.\" My programming dictated my reality. I thought that I was living th is intentional movie-scrambled reality while the actua l event was hidden beneath the surface of this prog ramming. As I experienced the flashback of the actual occurr ence, I could feel the cold water on my body, taste the salt water and hear the helicopter. They dangled a rope ladder down and my instructions were to \"climb the stairw ay to heaven.\" As I did, I entered the movie reality my p rogramming commanded, and felt like I was on an angelic/dolphin mission. The rope ladder stung the bottom of my feet. When I made it to the top, a man grabbed my arm and pulled me in, sat me down, put headphones o n my ears and said, \"Listen and learn,\" as I retain ed the message to deliver to the leaders. One night, the R eagans and a foreign guest went to dinner late in t he evening. I was taken along as this man's escort. (I am sorry t hat at this time I am not able yet to remember his name.) We went by limo to a restaurant in a large shopping area th at had storefronts like boutiques or the French Qua rter, with brick walkways leading to the back and flowers alongside. We ate outside at a patio table surrounded by bush es and flowers; it was very private. The Secret Service we re with us but kept a low profile, so as not to att ract anyone's attention. Something happened at the restaurant when Nancy and I went to the restroom. She said something to me about indecently coming on to her husband and then she slapped me . It really messed me up, as slapping was also part of a program to switch me into different personalities. A Secret Service agent quickly took me aside . I had switched into a child personality and was crying, and he could no t let me go back to the table like that. He straigh tened me up, smoothed out the rough emotional edges, and took me back to the table where everyone was finishing up. Despite this incident, we had a successful late night dinne r with this man and went back to the Puamana withou t being detected. It was the only time I knew of that Reaga n went into public during the entire trip. I think this guest had expressed a desire to see the small town of Lahaina . He did not seem too concerned about the security risks and Bush encouraged Reagan to go and entertain him. Rea gan and Bush usually went into public places separa tely for security reasons. After my use with Reagan at the P uamana was over, I was taken back to my family. I do not know what happened to them in my absence, but just like each occasion before, none of us expe rienced a break in time, and no one knew that I was gone or t hat I had \"just\" returned."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" When we returned to California, no one in my family thought of this hidden experience again, as it was buried deeply under programming. Reagan's Ranch I was also taken to the Ranch to visit President Re agan, as I had at times in the past when he was Gov ernor. I was picked up in front of my home in Agoura by a man in a suit and was flown to the Ranch located near San ta Barbara, California. Ronnie insisted saddling up the horses himself when we went riding, even after he became P resident. He did not want anyone (including Secret Service agent s) to do it and so he did it himself! I rode the br own horse. President Reagan \"acted\" very romantically while we rode, just like we were in some old movie! It seem ed he lived in a type of \"movieland\" mentality a lot of the tim e. We rode all over the ranch, down near the Oak gr ove on the far side. It was beautiful in the springtime, with gree n grass and wild flowers as far as one could see. W e got off our horses and he put his arm around my waist and pulle d me to him for a kiss. He explained, \"A man needs a young woman in his life to make him feel younger.\" I just smiled. I did a lot of that, didn't use many words , just smiled, and was pleasing, helpful and compliant. That is ho w I was created to be. Then Reagan sang, \"Younger than springtime.\" He too k his hat off and put it over his heart while he wa s singing, just like he was in some musical. He could be very corny. Later he explained he had barbed wire put in between the wood fencing on the Ranch to keep people out. He sa id he didn't like to have to do that, but the Secre t Service suggested he go along with it for security reasons. He explained that he did not like to always have p eople watching him, but that it went with the job now-it was diffe rent than when he was Governor, but, he explained t hat nothing could change our relationship, we would just have t o be more careful. Nancy Reagan was very mean to me, much meaner than Barbara Bush ever was. Barbara Bush just sort of ignored me altogether, whereas Nancy was very angry and controlling . I liked it best when Nancy was not around. When Henry Kissinger or George Bush met with Reagan at the ranch, Nancy served them snacks. I was neve r allowed to eat, but just sat quietly wherever I was \"parked\" and recorded information into my mind fil es whenever I was directed to. Henry knew just how to file it ins ide of me, all in the correct storage areas for eas y retrieval later on. They met at the ranch quite often. Sometimes we flew to meet big leaders in their own country, if they were at all concerned about the security at the ranch. But most people felt pretty safe there with all of the security systems and the Secret Service agents. I observed a lot of Secret Service security techniques because at times Henry left me with them when I was not being used. Henry sat me n ext to the agent at the security monitor and told h im to keep an eye on me, but to not feed or talk to me. So, I was able to watch the monitor and listen to the agents . They even had agents placed at the far corners of the ranch all n ight long for security. Each agent carried a walkie -talkie to keep in touch with each other and the agents in the house. A Secret Service agent was stationed inside the hou se with television monitors and other equipment to help sup ervise the agents outside and was always listening to the men in the field with the walkie-talkies. The agents took shifts so that there was always someone fresh and a lert manning all the \"posts\" 24 hours a day and night. Reagan laughed a lot when he was Governor and in th e beginning days of his Presidency, but he acted very differently after he was shot . Kind of like how different Nixon became after the Watergate scandal broke. Like the life went out of him . Reagan gave me a bracelet on one occasion when we were at the ranch. But I had to turn it over to the men who flew me by helicopter back home to Agoura. Nancy had been gone that weekend. She u sually was when Reagan and I were together sexually. But, she saw me when Kissinger and Reagan or Bush used m e at the ranch for mind file use. It seemed like she hat ed it when she noticed her husband perk up when I w as around, so she was mean to me. Actually, even under mind contr ol the parts of me that were dedicated to Reagan fe lt sorry for her, having to be married to him, if he had sex wit h her in the same passive manner he did with me. The Conception of Our Third Child Under Mind Contro l In 1980, I felt a deep desire for a third child, th ough I am not sure if I ever really was solely resp onsible for having decided such things on my own, or if it was up to t he Council, Bob, Henry, etc. My husband fought me f or months on end, with the logical reasoning that we had the perfect family - a little boy and girl, and for him they were"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"enough. But for me, it wasn't. I was experiencing e xcruciating female reproductive pains and had been for a long time, and my pain seemed to increase as time went o n. When I sought medical help, Dr. Feldman , my OB/GYN doctor, examined me and said, \"You have a large fib roid tumor growing in your uterus,\" and his avenue of resolve for my worsening condition was a hysterectomy. Look ing back on this situation from where I am now in m y more healed understanding, I realize it was indeed this man's attempt to help me remove my \"hysteria.\" Unfo rtunately, I was unable to understand that this hysteria that ma nifested physically in my innermost female private part, was the cellularly stored terror and devastation of my chil dren and me. I was unable to think on my own, but I could understand what I felt. And, what I felt in my hear t was that I wanted a third child and I wanted him desperately. I don't know if I was programmed to know, but I knew then that this child was to be a boy. From his authoritative position between my legs, as he examined me, my doctor's orders were that I cou ld have 30 days to try to conceive a child and after that time I was to return for the hysterectomy. Craig and I used the \"scientific method,\" the same method we used in the past to insure that the sex of our third child was a boy. And he was. Daniel Robert Ford was born on March 15, 1982 at Los Robles Hospital in Thousand Oaks, California. I was 31 years old. I have little conscious memory of Dan ny as a baby. When he was visiting me in the summer of 1996, he looked at me emotionlessly and said, \" Mom, I don't remember anything about my childhood .\" He just stated the fact. What was very apparent to me was that my teen age son had no emotion attached to this statement o r even any means to think this thought through to understand w hat it all might mean. It seemed like he was merely reporting it to me and, having done enough of my own healing to realize what this all meant, I was devastated. Unde rstanding now that my children will not be served by remember ing anything about their past until they are in a s afe, supportive environment to do that, I simply acknowl edged his reality and recommitted to doing whatever I could to bring about his freedom. War Games at Jordan Ranch to Terrorize Kelly and Me When Kelly was around three years old, we were told to walk down to the \"end of the road,\" which I kne w to be Bob Hope's Jordan Ranch. Once inside the fence we w ere injected with drugs in the back of a limo and w ere told to start walking out onto the ranch. Somehow, all of a sudden, my little daughter was gone. There was a w hole group of men in army fatigues who I later found out were playing war games. But in the drugged state of mind they put me in, I had no way to know this was just a game. B ob had a walkie-talkie that he used to radio instru ctions to the men in army fatigues. He told them what to do and s ay to us. I know because the guys would listen to t heir walkie- talkies while I heard Bob say directions like, \"Ok, rape her now .\" These guys were shooting their weapons and throwing hand grenades. As I revivified the memory I was ab le to realize that the hand grenades and gunfire were all fake, but the dr ugs I was subjected to made everything feel very real and very terrifying . While these men were shooting at me , I was running for my life , ducking under bushes trying to stay alive so I could find my little girl , and the drugs made it impossible to think clearly . They told me Kelly's life depended on me finding her quickly . A helicopter flying overhead landed nearby and I finally found Kelly, naked and huddling near a small scrub bush. She was very dirty and had cried so much that her little eyes were swollen nearly shut and her face was covered w ith dirt and tears all mixed together . She was crying so hard that she was shaking and had begun the involuntarily sniffling and jerking that infants do when they hav e cried for a very long time . I picked her up and took her, as directed, over t o the helicopter. Due to the severe trauma, I was unable to retrieve the rest of this devastating exp erience. This is the type of activity these men needed to us e in order to guarantee that, under national securi ty, a mother and her baby daughter would never remember the perverte d experiences for which they were being used by Hen ry Kissinger, Bob Hope and the agenda of our other hig h-level controllers. When I was deprogramming and r eally getting beneath my instilled trauma-based programs in order to retrieve my experiences, my programmed mother sent me a picture of Kelly that she had taken. In i t, Kelly was crouched down, hiding beneath a bush. Most likely our controllers had my mother send that picture in an attempt to tap into this traumatic memory in ord er to remind me what my odds were, in order to keep me under con trol. Trauma Before Use "},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"After I had my children, they always inflicted trau ma on me and one or more of my kids (always with my daughter Kelly) before an assigned rendezvous took place. Th ose experiences were terrifying and horrific enough so, that my controllers felt very certain I would never gain ac cess to memory of the experiences the trauma was me ant to cover. The trauma they inflicted on me and then on my chil dren in front of me, began when they were born. The following is a vivid example of the kind of programming and t orture my family and I had to endure before I was u sed with a President, Governor, Senator, entertainer, or whoev er else they decided they wanted to send me in on. I have no way of knowing what the rest of my family might hav e been assigned to, in my absence. This time, we we re in Catalina and my husband told the kids that we were going to look at a new hotel complex on the island. When we arrived, three men in suits told us to go into a ro om where there was a single row of chairs lined up against the wall. We were told to sit down in the straight back chair s. Passively and robotically, we helplessly complie d. Kevin our oldest son., who then was nine, was the first in th e lineup; then Craig, me, and Kelly, who was seven, and last, at the far end, our youngest son Danny, who was three. One of the suited men took a razor blade or something similar and started with Kevin and slowly and deliberately ran it over the top of his legs, then onto Craig's, the n mine, Kelly's and little Danny's. All of us were bleeding and tra umatized, in a daze, physically frozen, staring str aight ahead. I was terrified and panicked, but sat there, helpless to do anything to protect my children, as a result of years of abuse and mind control programming. Craig could do nothing to defend the children or me . He couldn't even defend himself. All of us just sat there like zombies with blood trickling off our burning legs . One suited man informed us, \"This is just the beg inning,\" and they took Danny and threw him up against the wall . With the air knocked out of him and in obvious pa in, he crumpled over and crouched up into a small ball, al ready, at three years old, knowing better than to c ry out or make a sound. They always did something horrific and if the kids or I cried out or showed any reaction or r etaliation, they would hurt another one of the kids or me even more. Craig simply took his seat and never moved until h e was told to. He was totally and completely immobilized. Watching my children get hurt was always the worst; nothing they ever did to me was ever as bad. Then one of the men took a cotton ball doused with alcohol and dabb ed the blood off our legs. It stung badly. Then the men in suits took me away, and told my family, \"run along and pl ay at the beach. Your mother will be along in awhil e. You will never even miss her, never even be aware she is gon e.\" Without reaction, Craig stood up and roboticall y walked out the door with the kids following in like manner. Af ter my family was gone, they took me to an empty ro om, ordered me to strip naked and they began slapping me around until I sank into a shivering, naked ball in the c orner of the room. The rest of the day, all night, and part of t he next day, I was left in isolation. Food and wate r were deliberately withheld until I was reunited with my family, which could be up to three days. A man in a suit would come to get me out of isolation and take me to get ready for Reagan or Nixon, or Pete Wilson or whomev er. I was instructed to shower and dress in the clothes they provided. Outfits, complete with accessories just m y size, were left for me. After the sexual encounter was complet ed, I was taken back to the room and ordered to put on my own clothes. Hypnotic commands were given to, \"simply w alk out and sit down with your family on the beach. You will not notice any lapse of time, but will resume inter acting with your family normally and naturally.\" On this occasion, I was told to sit down next to Craig on my beach ch air and it was as if I had never been gone! No one mentioned another word about it. The experiences were suppose dly wiped away from all of our minds as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened. Each time I was taken, there was similar trauma bef ore they could \"safely\" use me and be able to insur e that my programming and amnesia would remain locked up tigh tly. All of this for a Governor's or President's sexual perversions, or for the fulfillment of the New World Order agenda . Bob Hope's Escapades We owned a large family camper that was fully self- contained and we kept it stocked and packed, comple tely ready at anytime should we decide that we wanted to get a way for a long weekend or week vacation. We travele d regularly on Thanksgiving holidays and during summe rs, often driving up Highway 1, winding up the scen ic and beautiful California coastline. We went to Ojai Val ley, Big Sur, Carmel, Monterey, San Francisco, Oxna rd, Paso Robles, Santa Barbara, Leo Carrillo State Beach, Em ma Woods State Beach, Pismo Beach, San Luis Obispo, and Napa Valley. At other times we went up into the Hig h Sierras, to visit Mammoth, Sequoia, Tahoe, Reno, Yosemite"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"National Park, Big Bear, and Crestline. We also too k the children to Six Flags Magic Mountain and, of course, Disneyland. Bob Hope showed up in many of these locations . It seemed like he was everywhere. I had a number I called to let him know my vacation plans or he would make the sug gestion of where to go. When we arrived at our dest ination, I wouldn't consciously know to expect to see him but the part of me that was programmed and readied for the rendezvous was instructed to walk towards him when he appeared. Sometimes he would snap his fingers in front of my face or jingle his keys in front of my eyes to g et me to respond. He often liked to meet for sex or information exchange in mountain cabins. He would say he needed some time away from the hustle and bustle of city life and I was his plaything. He said I was better than \"Jeani e\" (the genie) because all she did was come out of a bottle. He said with me he could rub my magic spot and it was magic-he'd come! He usually spoke in clever little lines and phrases. I met him aboard yachts, also, even when I thought Craig and I were simply going sailing with friends. What actually occurred often was a rendezvous with Bob or some leader they needed to get information t o. Sometimes Reagan was brought out on a little ocean excursion and ended up navigating right to us. I wa s then transported aboard with him for sex and messages. S ometimes I stayed all night with him on his transpo rt and then was put back on the sailboat I came on the next day . Reagan in Mazatlan I was with President Reagan in Mazatlan, Mexico. In fact, my husband and I acquired a timeshare, the \" Presidential Suite,\" at the El Cid Hotel, in Mazatlan, where we went in later years. One evening in the early 80's, while we were 'vacat ioning' in Mazatlan, Craig and I dressed to go out and I became panicked because I put my contact lens on inside ou t and couldn't get it back out. From my attempts my eye was becoming red and ugly. Craig's father was with us a t the time and the two of them thought I was acting very strangely to be so upset about such a little thing. But, my inner system of personalities knew that th is would not do when I was nearing an assignment with the President . The next thing I remembered, I was escorted by th e Secret Service to the back door of a dark Mexican Restaura nt. I joined Reagan in a booth in the back of the r estaurant and waited for him to finish eating. It wasn't long unt il we walked out on the beach. We walked hand in ha nd along the beach with the Secret Service agents following a sh ort distance behind us. As we were walking on the b each that night, Reagan seemed upset and anxious, very nervous . He said he was concerned about the 'state of affa irs.' With my preprogrammed sexual orientation, my mind immedi ately went to the thought of sexual affairs, but as he continued speaking I realized he was speaking of th e affairs of the nation. He went on to explain that being President was difficult, that there was a lot more to it than I could imagine. He said he was concerned about the way things were going and was upset with Kissinger about some things he had handled . He said he was very upset with Henry for taking so many matters into his own hands . He said he knew a few hours with me would help hi m snap out of the mood he was in. I had been given a few key words by the Council to help Reagan \"snap out of it \" when he got into one of his slumps. They were very simple phrases like, \"everyt hing will be okay,\" said while I was rubbing or car essing his forehead over and over. He seemed to respond to tha t like a kitten going into a purr. I would generall y rub him all over, front and back, before climbing on top of him to satisfy him sexually. We went into a little cab in-type motel on the beach. It was just the two us with Secret Se rvice agents all around outside. The little room wa s done in Mexican design; a red bedspread in Mexican colors, yellows and blues, and a little pair of maracas sat on a wooden dresser. I had sex with him and then we left; he di d not go to sleep as usual. He hugged me briefly ou tside the motel and kissed me on the cheek before he left with the Secret Service agents. A Secret Service agent took me back to where I was staying with my husband. It was a very quick encounter; rushed, like Reagan had somewhere else to go. Craig and I returned to our home in California without conscious knowledge of my \"missing time\" or of what he did during my absence. NASA When Danny was an infant we went for programming to gether. He was a year old when his innerspace mind files were created in order for him to have a wide range of access po ints, without the necessity of as much trauma as was necessary back in the days when mine were created . Time had shown our controllers that trauma itself w as one"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"cause for the breakdown in slaves . So Danny was exposed to their newer technology, fro m birth , and Danny and I were both heavily programmed and cross-programmed t ogether. I was there with Danny when he was 3 or 4 years old. It seemed like a school field trip, but the se ries of events that unfolded were much different. D anny had on long baggy blue print shorts and a light blue T-shirt. W e were sitting with other mothers and children, in the front row of a circular auditorium. Men in NASA suits , who were dressed like astronauts were all around and one of them came over, lifted Danny up and put him into a chair . \"Like the real astronauts sit in!\" the man explai ned. This chair had equipment all around it . Danny smiled so sweetly across the auditorium at me like he was so proud and so happy to be chosen to sit in the big astronaut chair. There was such anticipated exc itement and innocence in his joyful smile. Soon the man instructed him to lean back so his head was properl y aligned to fit into a silver band and when Danny was in the proper alignment, I watched the NASA official clamp the back of the silver band to fit snugly around h is little forehead. Danny looked up at the NASA official, eye s wide with innocence and youthful exuberance, and smiled as the man said to Danny, \"Hold on for the ride of you r life!\" Another man brought in some sort of visual/optical glasses (virtual reality?) to rest in front of Dann y's eyes and told him to look into the viewer. Then to my horror, the man standing next to Danny gave a cue to another m an and I watched in agony as Danny's little body jolted . They must have been giving him electroshock and God knows what else. After a time, his little body went limp and he was unconscious . I was dying inside, but knew from many past experiences with his older brother and sister that if I made any attempt to interfere things would onl y get worse for all of us, especially Danny, so against all materna l protective instinct, I maintained my composure. P retty soon the NASA official waved a smelling salt or something in a cotton ball bound with gauze, in front of Danny' s face. He came to abruptly and they released him from the equ ipment and then from the chair. He was sweating pro fusely around his forehead and under his nose. As the man helped him out of the chair, Danny looked over at m e and several facial expressions quickly washed over him. At first he looked utterly humiliated and embarrassed , which was soon replaced with a look of utter shame that spread over his entire f ace and down his little body . He could barely walk over to me and when I stood to help him, the NASA man said , \" He's a big boy, he can do this on his own .\" \" Mommy, I feel sick,\" my little son said as he hobbled over to me and put his head in my la p. The men did the same thing to several other children, inclu ding another little girl from Danny's preschool , Born Learners. Soon we were escorted out, put on a shuttle back to the airport and were flown home. None of this expe rience was available to my conscious mind until years later wh en I began the grueling process of deprogramming. A nd, to this day, Danny has no memory of this event available to his conscious mind. Different parts of me took car e of Danny and our controllers assigned other parts to take hi m to places for conditioning. The Highway to Heaven billboard that we had to pass along Kanan Road on the way to Zuma Beach or Point Mugu dissociated me. Instead of the actual sign, I would experience an internal experie nce of, \"You are going to another plane of reality, one that only exists in your imagination and this Highway is your start off point in going there,\" and, I would go i nto a programmed mode that my controllers called the High way to Heaven zone. There were landmarks (landmines ) all over California that they used in order to keep me in line, \"in the right state of mind.\" Danny's mind files were filled with data early on a nd expanded after he was three years old . I drove him to Point Mugu or we were intercepted at the intersection of Kanan and Agoura Road, and go in the car with these men. They usually drove a dark colored sedan with tinted wind ows. Whether I drove or not, these men took my son from me in the car at Point Mugu in the morning, and returned him back to me at the car by late afternoon. He wou ld just limply lie on my lap all the way home, and then I p ut him to bed in his crib where he slept until the next morning without waking. Whenever he and I would go to the beach to fly a ki te or play in the sand, they always took him away f rom me and brought him back later. Once some men on a Coast Gu ard boat took him from me at Zuma Beach when he and I were playing. He was around five. They came up clos e to shore, yet remained just beyond the crest of t he waves. A lifeguard type guy in a red swimsuit that was about 25 years old took Danny by the hand from the beach and swam out to the boat with him. Then they took off with m y son, while I stayed on the beach waiting, just si tting all alone, zombie-like until they returned my son. I helped Da nny walk back to our brown station wagon and we wen t home. Henry Kissinger filled Danny with high-level information , intended to span many years and to be delivered whenever necessary at specific future dates to larg e crowds of people . Danny had historical files put in, as did I."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":" At Born Learners Preschool at three to four years of age , Danny started special computer classes that kept hi m at school long hours , sometimes into the evening . When I asked him if he wanted to stop he always s aid he loved it, as did his best friend Justin . I believe programmers do more of the training via computer screen now, often using virtual reality. After computer class, I took the t wo of them to Monarch's Gymnastics, the same gymnas tics school his older brother and sister went to for lessons. I usually waited in the car or ran errands while the y were there and I was always so exhausted I could hardly stay awake. I had usually been to therapy abreacting the horror s of my own childhood and hurried home from Westwood to pick up Danny and Justin from preschool, and later on Dann y from Kindergarten. I didn't like Mike , the man who ran the gymnastics center . He had a very bad temper and was often emotionally out of control. Kevin, Kelly and Danny all went to Monarch's Gymnastics in conjunction wit h the Montessori preschools. I thought I would not be abl e to bear the pain and grief when I began rememberi ng scenarios of the ways in which I had been programmed to be a part of my children's preschool mind control experi ences. This is information I would prefer to withhold because i t goes against everything I believe in, but in orde r for people to understand how this system works, it is necessary f or me to share the following. Keep in mind that thi s scenario could have happened to any three of my children and indeed it did. But once again, I will use an exper ience I remembered about Danny because, for whatever reason , I have more memory retrieved about him. This event occurred in Danny's preschool. On occasi on, I helped out in the class. I remembered standin g with Danny's preschool teachers who were instructing the children in a game where they all had to take thei r clothes off , step onto a colored circle and then take turns doin g sexual acts to the child next to them . The teachers were laughing and clapping and everything seemed surreal, just li ke it always did when programmed events of horror o ccurred. As the game progressed, with music playing in the back ground, the children looked progressively more stun ned. They were told to walk in a circle and stop on a color. If they didn't do what they were told, the teacher yanked them out of the circle by the arm and yelled at them. I coul dn't tell what she said but it scared the child int o compliance. The games always took place at the same time in the mor nings and were centered around colors, music, body movement and hand signals. Hand signals were taught to the c hildren this way and put to music for reinforcement . There was a VCR off to the side of the classroom where an indiv idual child was placed to watch a special pre-selec ted tape. The child was taken out of the circle, sat in front of the VCR and told to focus on the movie. This way ea ch child got the individual training they were supposed to have acco rding to what their curriculum planners felt were t heir strengths and career aptitudes. All of the special private preschools my children w ent to took this approach. And, ritual trauma and sexual perversion was often the way we w ere programmed to begin with the children . Danny completed computer classes in preschool befor e he was four years old. During my deprogramming pr ocess, I was horrified when I remembered that I continually read him the story of Danny and the Dinosaur. As I re-read the story years later, I found a phrase in the book, wh ich states, \"there's no place to run, no place to h ide. \" And here again was another example of how 1, as his programm ed parent, was used to keep my own son's programmin g locked tightly in place, reinforcing the programs t hat were used to keep the parts of his mind that we re compartmentalized for our controller's use, separat e from his conscious everyday awareness. And consci ously, neither of us had any idea that any of this was occ urring. Henry Kissinger has been Danny's main man . He was the one calling the shots and organized the creation of Danny's mind files for NASA/military use . Danny was, and may still be, scheduled for a major position within NASA one day , following in the footsteps of his grandfather Ford and Uncle Lyle Curran . They have him scheduled to become a scientist or something of tha t nature . I overheard Henry talking to someone about it. Danny has very specific programming themes that center ar ound all the planets - Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Pluto, Saturn, etc., and I was programmed to tell him often before he we nt to sleep, \"I love you to the moon and much, much , much, much, more than that. A thousand times more than th at. A trillion times more than that,\" and on and on until we got to the highest number beyond infinity, and Danny kn ew that number. For some reason I can't remember it . I never could. Then, he would go to sleep. Danny and Kelly both had those neon, glow-in-the-da rk stars and planets on their ceilings and so did 1 . Danny has tons of high tech information in his brain. I saw h im demonstrated at Point Mugu when they put him in front of a group to demonstrate his capabilities. Henry took D anny to different locations to 'display the technol ogy,' showing that a five year old could appear to be genius leve l, \"a computer whiz.\" He had mega memory, displayin g the intelligence level of what they termed a \"Junior Co llege Student.\" Danny was seen as having the intelligence of the future and they said he would blossom in high school, wha tever that meant. They said that, by then, Danny wo uld"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"be fully functional and used by them extensively in international work. Henry talked a lot about Danny and I remember Danny holding onto Henry's leg one time wh en he was demonstrating Danny in front of a whole g roup of people. Despite the programming, Danny remained ver y shy until he was 5 years old. Danny was also traumatized at Disneyland year after year . The Matterhorn ride was one they used before they took him away from me at Disneyland for other programmin g. There was further programming done at Edwards Air Force Base . Craig took us all there as a family in our camper and we stayed overnight and were programmed the next morning. Two men in white uniforms came to get Danny and me from the camper and compliantly and mindlessly we went with them. Kelly, in her little strawberry blouse, was crying that she didn't want Danny to go and Craig held her and spanked her leg to stop her crying. The men took us through glass doors and we were escorted once again to the big chair, where the nig htmare started all over. We sat side by side in the big heavy, metal chair while we looked into the large goggles that were placed in front of our faces. Before they began, we were injected with a drug. Earphones played music a t times, but mostly sound effects, while they told us we were 'one' and the solar system that we saw through our eyes would now exist in the innermost regions of ou r mind. There was a beautiful visual of the stars and plane ts and the whole universe. They told us that we eac h had a system, but that we also had the other half of the other pe rson's system much like those friendship bracelets that are separated and when they come together they are whol e. Afterwards, Danny's eyes seemed to be moving all over the place at once and not together. Even in my drugged state I was terrified for my child. Looking at what his eyes were doing was scary. Afterwards, they escorted us out a nd I helped my little boy into the camper and laid him up on the top bed so he could sleep. He lay backwards on the bed and didn't move, totally out of it for the rest of the day. I walked around outside in this big white gravel park ing lot with the other kids in a total zombie-like state. I felt totally drugged out of my mind and I fell asleep si tting up outside. When I woke up, I ran frantically into the camper to check on Danny. I held him and loved him. He loo ked to me like he was going to die. I said, \"I love you Danny, is there anything I can do for you?\" He was sucking his thumb by then and without any words, shook his head no. So I just held him. Kelly was taken to military bas es in Ventura, Oxnard, Point Mugu, and Edwards Air Force Base, but Danny went mostly to Point Mugu. The whole fami ly went to Edwards Air Force Base. Sometimes from P oint Mugu, they would helicopter Danny away and I never knew where they took him. Parts of Danny were progr ammed very early on to play the perfect game of chess, in order to take up where I left off in deciphering a nd delivering cryptic messages. Catalina Island Excursions One or two weeks a year were set aside for a planne d vacation. Extended weekend excursions were common place, often planned at the last minute. But, our August w eek on Catalina Island, 26 miles off the California coast, was a standing vacation for years. Craig and I went there almost every year from 1971 until I left Californi a in 1991; nearly 20 years. My children still go there with th eir father and, now that they are older, they have gone independently. I was used on Catalina Island, for sexual rendezvou s with Reagan and/or sometimes other public officia ls or entertainers. I was programmed to have sex with Rea gan at the Wrigley Mansion, the Zane Grey and other hotels on the island. It seems Reagan was usually on the isla nd anonymously; for security purposes, no one was t o know he was there. While I was busy carrying out my duties, I had no idea what my children and husband were up to. It seems likely that there was some reason they had us all there together. We're Paying Taxes For What?! And, I am sure that you the reader were unaware tha t your hard earned tax dollars were being spent on security, airflight, and high tech programming in order that Presidents and leaders could be extra-maritally sat isfied sexually, and that messages fueling the success and implement ation of the New World Order could be sent and returned via a national security mind-controlled asset. Not to m ention the salary of politicians and NSA people lik e Henry Kissinger who spent countless hours strategizing agendas to c arry out their personal plans .

I have randomly selected specific events I believ e will aid you the reader in understanding just how far mi nd control, gone unchecked, has proliferated. Tommy Lasorda gave a new meaning to the Dodger lineup. Instead o f the Dodgers lining up, it was women and children lining up for the baseball team to choose from, for sex. A Dodger incentive to do better - to win more! If they won, they got to choose - if they lost, no wom en . \"Dodger diamonds \" had a double meaning . In addition to the baseball diamond as on a baseb all field, in my experience, it also referred to the \"Dodger Diamond s,\" the mind controlled women the Dodgers could sel ect from for sex. Lasorda often spoke in cryptic language, i ntended to manipulate and inspire the Dodgers. Here 's an example. One evening as he spoke to the team, he sa id, \" If you play good on the Dodger diamond (the playing field), you will get in return a 'Dodger Diamond\"' (a sex slave ). Presidential model sex slaves often wore diamonds a s program identifiers. My daughter and I wore diamo nds, as well. Back in the men's locker room when the women and children in the \"Dodger lineup\" were in their p laces, Lasorda would point to a woman or child who had been 'chose n' by a player and say, \"he'll take that one .\" He never referred to anyone by name - always just pointed an d said, \"that one.\" It was part of the \"game\" they played after a win. The Dodgers weren't allowed to just go up and pick one of us. They had to tell Lasorda who they wanted and then he would make the announcement . We then stepped forward to the player we were cho sen by and went with him to another room, corner or wherever he pleased. Sometimes the locker room was filled with Dodgers h aving sex with women and children at the 7th inning stret ch, to \"inspire and invigorate the team ,\" as Lasorda would say. But most of the time it was done after a winning ga me . Sometimes I got stuck with that little short guy - the one that walked like a duck to first base. His name was Ron Cey . He would often pick me from the lineup. After I w as chosen, he would lean against the wall with one arm and talk casually to me for a minute before he had sex with me. He was impressed with how well I could have sex sta nding up against the wall. He also liked my hair an d the whole idea that I was married. He seemed to know all about me , while I knew nothing about him, except that he sm elled like sweat and was really gross to the personality inside me who was created especially for this Dodge r purpose. Cyndy Garvey (Steve Garvey's now ex-wife) was often part of the \"Dodger lineup \" of women and children to be chosen by the Dodgers for sex after a winning game. My daughter Kelly was also occasionally used . They usually put Krisha and Whitney (the Garvey's young daughters) into the lineup . The players who performed the best during the game got to choose first. One night when they put Krisha and Whitney in the lineup, it was Whitney's first night . She was now \"old enough\" to participate, in spite o f the fact that she was only four or five years old . Cyndy started screaming, \"No, not Whitty!\" (That was the nickname she called Whitney.) Two men stepped forward and grabbed Cyndy by the arms and whisked h er away. They took her into the next room and we co uld all hear her screaming . It was awful. \"If you step out of line, you always pay the price, maybe with your life .\" Lasorda said . Then they took Whitney out of the line and into a side room, and we could all hear her screaming and crying. Lasorda said to thos e of us remaining, \"We won't have that problem anymore, wil l we.\" He was very brutal . "},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"When they brought Cyndy back into the room, Lasorda said Cyndy's behavior had caused Whitney to get hu rt. He said, \"If the mother had acted respectably, there w ouldn't have been a problem.\" When they brought Whitney back out, she could barely walk . She didn't make it into the lineup that night; sh e was too injured. I experienced and witnessed these types of horrors that kept me from ever interfering with what they were doing to my ch ildren, especially Kelly. I knew from experience that they would hurt her wor se if I ever tried to protect her . On nights the Dodgers lost, there was no Dodger lineup game and w e would all go home, but not before the Dodgers saw us lined up and then leaving. Tommy said he wanted the boys to learn from their mistakes and to have incentive to win big. \" Big wins equals big bucks ,\" Lasorda said. Tommy Lasorda and others humiliated Cyndy . They brought me into the locker room and put me u p against the shower wall. They put Cyndy across the room but clo se by, and they brought Steve in. He had sex with m e standing up against the wall. Cyndy was forced to watch and then someone, usually Lasorda, would tell her she w asn't good enough or enough of a woman for Steve. They told he r she was stupid and backward. Then Lasorda slapped her across the face really hard. I don't know why they did that, but they did it to me also and I watched other women get slapped often . While this was going on, Steve was laughing sadistically. Cyndy looked like she wasn't really \"there.\" Soon after, Tommy Lasorda took her out and sat her behind the dug out where she usually sat d uring the games - being the dutiful and supportive Dodger wif e. On nights like these, Tommy gave the press orders n ot to talk to or interview Cyndy. He told them if t hey did he would have them thrown out of the ballpark and he w ould have their job. If they asked why, he would sa y, \"She's not quite herself tonight.\" In line with the inform ation about Project Monarch , some rich people actually own certain Dodger players and their children . Often it's cryptically called \"sponsoring ,\" but it's really ownership (much like owning a racehorse) because the owner makes all the decisions about the players life without the knowledge or consent of the player . When the player does well, the owner collects large sums of money from behind the scenes . Steve Garvey , his (now ex) wife Cyndy , and their two children were \"sponsored\" (owned) by some wealthy person and from what I saw, the family was manipulated much the same way mine w as, through mind control , for the financial benefit of others. One night I watched, as I waited for the \"lineup,\" while Lasorda was coaching the team. He chalked a d iagram of the field onto a large chalkboard. The Dodgers were all sitting on a bench in front of him. Lasorda spoke in funny rhymes to some of the players, rhymes that didn't m ake much sense to me. It seemed that the players we re like robots that were robotically manipulated by the wor ds Lasorda spoke to them . I overheard him say, \"Steve (Garvey), you will hit a home run. Ron (Cey), you w ill bunt since you're a runt. Only runts bunt.\" And he went on and on like that, seeming to program the plays into the players. I never did end up watching much of the ballgames. If I tried I couldn't concentrate to watch because I was programmed to not see the players or to recognize t hem if I should see them. I was pre-programmed to n ot look at the Dodgers with the phrase, \"there will be blood e verywhere, if you continue to stare,\" or \"you won't recognize them anywhere, you won't even know they are there.\" People who didn't know how I was programmed often teased me about my inability to follow or understand baseb all games. One time, after attending games for a lo ng time, I asked my husband and the couple that was with us, \" Who are those men down there in suits?\" They looked at me like I was retarded and laughed in embarrassment fo r my question, and then explained, \"Those are the u mpires.\" I didn't know. I was just obeying program. Craig took me to the Dodger games, but I never want ed to go. I hated to go, but had no reason I could \"think\" of for not liking or attending the games. Sometimes our sm all children would go with us, and then they would show up in the \"Dodger lineup\" to be used by the Dodgers for s ex. I felt very out of control, despite the mind co ntrol I was under. Personalities inside of me didn't know how m y children got there or how they would get home or if they would be safe or killed. Craig stood and watched li ke a zombie and often had this strange, nervous lau gh that happened when he was anxiously trying to be a part of things. We were both totally helpless to think o r act in order to protect our children or ourselves. [This year, I saw kids accompanying Football teams at FIFA 2006. It seemed weird and I had a very bad feeling about that. Now, while reading this stuff here, I a m horrified to think if those children were there a s slaves? – MC] "},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Tommy Lasorda was connected to a lot of mob-type men . They were always around Dodger Stadium in their s uits with concealed weapons. At times there were secret, private meetings at Dodger Stadium during the game s. Sometimes the meetings were between politicians and at other times there were meetings where drug deal s took place, or meetings between mob members and other to p leaders in politics and/or the entertainment fiel d. These meetings often took place during the time the games were being played . In the early years, money was transferred for drugs, illegal stocks, bonds, or other investme nts . Money in briefcases was exchanged for something i n another briefcase. In my experience, this could have been a nytime from 1976 on. Bob Hope was limoed in just for a brief exchange and then le ft quickly . He had a thing for Cyndy, always kissing her and touching her breasts while she just stood r obotically. Whoever owned the Dodgers at one time u sed to come into the big fancy restaurant there at Dodger Stadi um or into the locker room. Many times Bob Hope would limo me in and give me specific instructions on how to s educe this man and ask him key questions or deliver messages. One owner had dark skin, dark hair, was average bui ld, and always wore a suit and dark glasses . He liked it when I took his glasses off his face, laid them down and s tarted kissing him. He wore strong cologne and blac k underwear, and had a holder for a gun he carried on his ankle. I was used to \"disarming\" men by \"carefully\" remov ing their weapons while I was seducing and disrobing them. I was instructed to do that sometimes for people who wanted others eliminated. They sent me in to seduce and disarm the person and then they would send in a hit man . I wasn't functional for days after one of these events so th ey quit using me for that type of assignment. This particular Dodger owner didn't like to be seen in public . He didn't operate alone and had a company of mob-ty pe men who worked for him . One day Bob Hope sent me in to \"console\" him. He wa s sitting alone on a locker room bench. I walked up to him and put my hand on his back so as not to startle hi m. He knew me and thought I worked for Lasorda. So, he let me go through my routine as I kissed him, rubbed his n eck, and got him calm and relaxed. Then he said, \"L et's get out of here.\" And he took me to a room at the stadium t hat is plush with a big bed in it. He ordered a bot tle of champagne and caviar from the restaurant and we got it quickly. I used the little white pills I was in structed to place in drinks to get the most cooperation when I was se nt in to gather information. He had sex with me and afterwards I asked him questions about a Colombian drug connecti on . I asked him where the transactions were taking plac e and he said, \"Jamaica .\" Then I asked him when they were taking place and he answered, \"in the spring when the apple blossoms are on the trees.\" And I asked him \" who \" and he told me, \" Tommy's group and the Feds .\" It seemed like everyone always knew everyone else. Reagan came to the Stadium on occasion. He often me t with Hope. They met in the restaurant there when the restaurant was closed to the general public and mad e plans. I know because I was witness to their conv ersations as I sat with them. Sometimes my job was to listen and c orrect them if anything they said went against some thing in my data/mind files. These deals were connected up to w hoever was in the White House at the time. Reagan, Ford , and Bush were all there at different times . With the Presidents, it seemed that there was alr eady built into this corrupt drug/porn network a place or slot for the highest l evels of government - the President - because the p eople who were Presidents came and went, but the job they did was always the same . It seemed like the stadium was a place where they could meet undetected or something. On occasion I was flown away in a helicopter with S ecret Service agents and taken to DC and debriefed or given new information to deliver somewhere else around th e country. Then I was flown home. Leaders from all over met at the Dodger Stadium. It was where the U.S. Govern ment, White House level and state level, met with t he Mob drug connections and made \"deals.\" These deals were made with people and leaders from all over the wor ld. No one ever knew they were there as they were limoed or he licoptered in and out at precise times--carefully c oordinated and timed by the Secret Service. During the time Steve Garvey was playing for the Dodgers he had an office in Calabasas that was used by him and the group that controlled him for illegal activitie s and pornography - adult and kiddy porn . I was filmed pornographically in Steve's so-called office with a variety of people, including himself, his wife, an d his children. Even my own children were pornographically filmed t here at different times. Sometimes they filmed my d aughter Kelly with Whitney and Krisha in kiddie porn. Lots of other children were filmed pornographically incl uding our oldest son Kevin. But these weren't filmed at Dodge r Stadium; instead they were filmed in private offi ces or homes. Cyndy and I were filmed together in porn, at Steve' s office. We both had little skimpy French maid apr ons on and nothing else. Cyndy wore something like a black eye mask, maybe in their effort to disguise her. She h ad a bowl of"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"whipped cream that she held and smeared all over he r body and I was forced to lick it off of her while they filmed. I was told beforehand what to do and say. They took c lose up shots when I was commanded to perform oral sex on her. There was other pornography shot during this t ime, beginning in the 1980's. When my daughter Kelly was old enough (3 and up) they began filming Cyndy, our dau ghters, and myself . A title to one of these films was Mommy and Me. Porn of Cyndy and I was filmed on a private beach in Malibu. I was picked up in a white van an d at other times was picked up by a limo. Cyndy, some dogs, an d I were running naked on the beach while they film ed us. Some of this was filmed in the \"Colony\" in front of one of Barbra Streisand's homes. Barbra wasn't hom e when they took us to do the porn. \"Our love must not be a thing of words and fine tal k. It must be a thing of action and sincerity.\" -- I John 3:18 Chapter Twenty-seven Education 2000 Las Virgenes School District Henry once said, \" There is nothing more convincing than to have a pre gnant woman speaking out for educational issues .\" He had me speaking to groups that were involved in various aspects of education from the top offici als and big wigs down to California State legislators. He s aid I was fighting to increase the level of educati on for my future progeny; starting now, so by the time they were in school I could rest assured that they would get the finest education possible. I began this in 1978 when I was very pregnant with Kelly. He used me in Sacramento to \"further legislation for our children's education.\" And I we nt to Washington, DC, when it became necessary to t ake what had been won in California in the way of educational ad vancement and present it to influential people in D C who could make a difference in furthering this goal. California was the model and once the framework was set they wanted the new educational system to be u sed nationwide , but that took planning and fortitude. Years of preparation went into this to insure that the nation's children would be ready for the year 2000, when the ir transformation of the masses would be complete . \"...And peace will guide the planet and love will r ule the stars ...the dawning of the Age of Aquarius .\" Through programming, this song was instilled within my mind to anchor a lot of this educational activi ty and to also bring me under a greater influence of my true birth sign, Aquarius. The plan was for my humanitarian interests to be of such a magnitude that I would become internation ally known as a leader in ending child ritual abuse . This focus would have served to keep those who found out about this abuse \"busy\" and distracted with \"satanic beh avior,\" and still not aware of mind control, until they could g radually implement the transformation to get people more completely under control. They referred to the time frame after the year 2000 takeover, as \" The Great Transformation .\" Don Zimring , the Superintendent of Schools for the Las Virgenes School District (LVSD) was heavily involved in deciding which children got special instruction . Each 'special' child in the school had their own program design and was individually monitored so they would get th e early training and conditioning they would need t o fulfill their destined position within the hidden inner circle fr amework. I was programmed to report to the LVSD off ice to see Don Zimring in order to be \"instructed\" in regard t o the \"special\" children who were in need of indivi dual attention and individual programs. I sat before him in a robo tic \"sponge\" state, while he rattled off profiles o f children and special videos or instruction booklets they were to be subjected to. By the time the children hit elem entary school they were conditioned sufficiently so that their \"p rograms\" could be absorbed readily and easily throu gh just saying a word that opened their access way to special abil ities, like photographic memory or rapid learning s tates. Many women, purposefully placed in teacher and principal positions, were either programmed themselves or ju st didn't pay attention when a child was removed from class f or \"special instruction .\" Children were targeted for their natural talents and abilities . For example, in families who were athletically in clined, or where one or both parents excelled"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"in sports, they put in access codes for \"super athl etes\" and then someone from higher up had the optio n of stepping in and 'sponsoring' a child with a promising future . Which meant that this \"higher up\" funded so calle d 'special education' for this child, often without the parent 's conscious involvement or consent, and from then on had a special interest in how things were taught to the c hild. Kelly was monitored closely, always having a special tuto r to \"shore her up .\" Our controllers viewed her as a young beauty and no ted her extremely positive social skills and built upon those . There was an \"inner group\" of school officials, p arents and teachers who were involved in seeing to it that the preconditioned children were groomed in th e ways necessary for them to step into future pre-d esignated positions. The people behind this scheme have done endless res earch on the brain in response to everything , including spinning rides at amusement parks, and know just what level of stimulation is needed to ma ke programming most effective . Over the years the research has been tried and te sted through the experimentation on children who were targeted before birth. The geneti c engineering aspect is highly used and they take i nto consideration the inherent genetic talents and abil ities coupled with just the right training at the r ight age to produce a \"highly advanced child.\" But, in essence, what th ey truly have created is a highly advanced robot th at has been dehumanized to the point of not being able to think or choose for themselves. They have been robbed of their free will or any real choice in their lives. The California Capital 'Sexcramento' and Senator Pe te Wilson The organization and framework is large. There were many people involved and the technology over the y ears has risen to the level where children in the preschools require less trauma and torture in the beginning s tages to set in the \"cues and programs\" that will be built upon in later years. Pete Wilson was very involved with all of this and was set into position in the 1980's . I was sent to Sacramento with Ann Eklund , the principal of Sumac Elementary School, in the early 1980's, to set up these progra ms through the school districts . Although at the time I didn't know I was participating in this, years later, during a flashback, I remembered boarding a plane with her, getting off with her and being met by a taxi that drove us to office s of the California State Department of Education. It seems that the instructions to implement these \"special progra ms\" filtered down from \"the top.\" The higher ups see it as technologically advancing the children, creating \"m ega minds of the future\" for later use within their own system. The children are force fed information into previou sly set up inner systems of mind files and are trai ned to be able to accept vast amounts of highly technological info rmation beginning at age three. They are not taught to think, but only to be used and accessed like a computer. Ann Eklund was highly involved in the project and had been sin ce its inception . The framework was set into great motion in Sacramento in the early 80's between Ann, Don Zimring, Pete Wilson and several officials fro m Washington, DC. I was flown to DC to speak before a committee meeting to describe how the program was progressing. Sometimes a child would be \"demonstrated\" to the co mmittee to show the advanced mind technology that was possible . Disbelieving Senators and Congressmen 'in the know, ' needed to see to believe . The child could be made to perform on cue and recite mega amounts o f highly complex technological information. They sa w these children as being prototypal descendents of mine. T hese particular politicians knew how I was used wit h Henry Kissinger and were \"amazed\" to know that any simila rly conditioned child could possess the same qualit ies of mind ability. Reagan was also involved and so was Bush . Our instructions for individual children's progra mming often came from the White House level as many of these we althy people \"adopted\" and \"supported\" children \"wi th promise.\" These elite overseers viewed the 'special ' children as the minds of the future, the future w orld leaders, preprogrammed with their own wisdom and desires for how they feel the world should be run, based on th eir own values. GOD HELP US! LVSD was the No. l pilot program and many funds wer e approved to be used within the school district, b ut were actually skimmed off the top to finance a lot of \"s pecial programs,\" really aimed at the children who had been targeted. Children who were targeted were dismissed from class, taken to a room for special attention and were hooked up to special audio tapes, linked with accom panying picture books, in the beginning years, and then later on to computers and sound. Large reels of film were us ed occasionally when not available on video and it was timely for the information to be \"visually cued\" into a ch ild's brain. But usually it was done by video or co mputer. It created complex brain function and set up controls within the child that these people manipulated. They have performed experiment after experiment over the year s to develop the most effective equipment to use on children . Much of the funding earmarked for use within the sc hool district was siphoned off to be used for resea rch and to"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"pay technicians to develop and test the equipment, computer programs, etc. During that time, many of t he state school funds were misappropriated and used for thin gs other than what they were approved for. I am pretty sure now that the memories I had of acc ompanying Reagan to Point Mugu and other places for speeches, was when I was being \"demonstrated\" to others and w as cued to speak about the same technology that was being used with children three, four, and five years old. Reagan used me often for demonstration because he said I stood the test of time, which meant that I had been in op eration for over 30 years without a leak, or withou t a problem. I heard him explain to people that I was so \"real\" th at he sometimes forgot I was a programmed robot. He said he liked that because, \"you get all the benefits of a robot with human softness added.\" He was very proud of the technology and spoke freely about it within a trust ed group. I was presented to the military, to polit icians, etc., for them to see and witness the technology, and then I presented my pre-programmed information. Many reque sted private demonstrations of my sexual capabilities in order to become believers. Whenever there were men at the presentations, and usually they were men, there wer e private one-on-one sexual demonstrations afterwar ds. In my head, when I was retrieving these memories, I kept hearing the phrase, \"Senate subcommittee meet ings on advancing education in America.\" I remember Pete Wi lson speaking and there was a demonstration done on the educational system that had nothing to do with what was actually going on behind the scenes, but they had to justify the large amounts of money that they were trying to appropriate for their secret system. It was all a sham - they knew they would get the money, they knew where it w as coming from and how they could get it. It was ju st a matter of making the steps and actions look like it was all above-board, while behind the scenes they planned the new technology in education, privately. Their attitudes were that other people in the priva te sector wouldn't be able to grasp what they were doing because they didn't h ave the required intellect . So, they justified its secrecy this way, feeling this new system was the advancement of soci ety and until people could really see the results i n action and how effective these methods of education would be i n the advancement of society, they needed to keep t he methodology quiet. They used big words to intimidat e those people they wanted to leave them alone and they were quite successful at accomplishing that. People who couldn't understand what they were sayin g would back down and walk away. They used me for t his project beginning in the early 80's and didn't care whether I was pregnant or just out of the hospital or what. They just overrode what my personal situation was by usi ng my multiplicity. Pete Wilson was probably electe d governor so that they could pull this whole thing off withou t any problem. Ann Eklund introduced me to him in t he very early 80's and the sexual connection was made, then I was fed information by the Council (from the hotel roo m in the Holiday Inn or the Marriott) to \"deliver\" to Pete e ven in the early years. He jumped though all the ho ops they presented to him with no problem and so they kept p romoting him just like they did Reagan. Only differ ence was, Reagan seemed ignorant compared to Pete and I guess that meant that Pete was more knowledgeable and better informed about certain situations, beyond acting in accordance with what the Council wanted . Reagan just acted in accordance, like a puppet with no understanding of what he was doing in so many situations, always wor ried about the state of affairs of the Nation, but easily calm ed and his attention diverted to another subject. The school district plans were directly tied into t he preschool abuse. They made sure they had \"qualified\" preschools set up in areas near the elementary and secondary education schools so the children would b e \"prepared\" before entering kindergarten . Then the public school system had in place the ne twork of people to carry out the children's \"further education.\" The controllers hav e people placed in positions, high up, in widely va rying areas to fund their plan and to fill the positions required in order to make it successful. They had programmed people in place from the janitor all the way up to the school district supervisors and on into the state and fed eral government. All key positions were filled to make sure their pl an is implemented and failsafe . They moved key people around as needed. In 1985, not long after my April 12th auto accident , I continued on as coordinator of the carnival at Sumac Elementary. I had been working on it for months. Bu t I was in so much pain that I had to do it with a neck brace and the aid of Percodan. My mother and father even atte nded, with my father in a wheel chair-all this took place before I remembered any of my past. The funds that came from that little Saturday event were significant enough , with thousands of dollars raised, that the head of the P ark and Recreation Department for Agoura invited me to be the fundraiser for the local parks department. Between the money earned by this carnival and the large sum s earned by the Agoura Great Race, organized by a friend of min e, the school was able to buy computers, turning a whole section of a stage area into row after row of compu ters. It was a few years later that I began remembe ring a little"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"boy sitting at one of those computers working away, 'lost in time.' I walked behind him and, as progra mmed, I intentionally lost my balance and drove my knee int o his back in order to further 'dissociate' him, an d then I tapped him on his left shoulder twice. There was usually a word command coupled with these actions, something that would cue the child back into a specific mind state or program at a later date. I also remember going up to one of Danny's teachers and saying something like, \"Are yo u going to teach the child about Napoleon?\" Napoleo n was the key word. I don't know what it did or was suppose t o do to the teacher, but it also was coupled with a tap on the left shoulder. Of course, while I know that I didn't con sciously plan why I said that, I also wonder who co ordinated all of this, cueing me to cue her and some of the stude nts. This new computer area installed at Sumac Elementar y got the 'special' children out of class and gave anyone who wanted to approach them, access to them. They got a permission slip from their teacher and went by the mselves to the computer area. Later, in therapy, I remembered pulling a videotape from my purse and coming up beh ind a child and changing what he was watching on a VCR. Later, they had computer disks that were similarly brought in. These children had been targeted since they were very sma ll. Many children at the school did not receive this \"s pecial attention\" - only those who were to become leaders in the future and those who were sponsored . Of course, in the intentionally created reality dri ven by the mind control I was under, I simply belie ved that I was a good wife and dutiful mother. I had no way of knowi ng I was being used in this way. \"If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain. If I can ease one life the aching, or cool one pain , Or help one fainting robin into his nest again, I s hall not live in vain. \" -- Emily Dickinson Chapter Twenty-eight Reagan, Kissinger, Bush and More Horrors One day, on assignment, I was standing at the top o f a very tall set of four or five tiers of marble s tairs. President Reagan walked out of a room below and paused a mome nt before he looked up and saw me. Quickly he put h is finger to his lips and I knew that meant to keep qu iet. He motioned for me to come downstairs and meet him outside. I promptly looked away from him so I would n't be publicly noticed or connected with him, and started walking. Once outside, a Secret Service agent direc ted me toward a limo and as I got close he took hol d of my head and pushed me inside. I was waiting when Reagan arr ived. He stepped in backwards so no one from the ou tside would be able to see me. After the door was shut, h e smiled and kissed me and said that he had missed me. He said he needed me to go with him to the Pentagon to intr oduce me to some friends of his. There I was expose d to file after file of small typed information and was intro duced to an officer who had on a dark blue uniform with gold trim that looked like a Navy uniform. Reagan instructed this man to show me information that was top-secret . This was information I needed to have in my mind files for s ome upcoming meeting. Then Reagan left. I followed this man to his office and watched while he opened his file dra wer, took out some files and laid them open on his desk. He left me with them and went out of the room, locking the door behind him, locking me inside. I was in his of fice for quite some time and went over four files in detail. I cou ldn't remember the details when I was deprogramming the documents to read them to you now. The officer kept checking on me and when I was through he escorted me to a waiting limo. Reagan wasn't there. White House Humo r \"Once in the White House always in the White Hous e, I know my own way upstairs!\" Bob programmed me to say to Presidents. When I said that to Reagan he said he didn't find that amusing. I told him, \"Well Bob said for m e to say that.\" Reagan immediately softened up, lau ghed and said, \"You tell that ole' buzzard I said hello.\" On ce you are on the list \"to do the White House\" they keep using you over and over if your Boss man agrees. Cozumel "},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"During September of 1984 or 1986, Craig and I went to Cozumel on a scuba diving vacation with a group of dental friends. A day and a half of the trip was reserved for Reagan. The men in suits came for me in the mid dle of the night. It often happened that way, where they just appeared in the room and took me away. They said th ey had come to \"prepare me,\" which I knew meant torture and iso lation, to be readied for my time with Reagan. I wa s put into a cement utility room. It was dark except for the pil ot light from a hot water heater located in the cor ner. That was the only light until daylight. I was stripped naked and left in the cold cement room all night alone. The men opened the door every so often and used electro-shock on me, b y putting a prod on my hips. My body contorted and convulsed, and my hands involuntarily rose uncontrollably into the air. Then, I collapsed into a heap on the floo r and they told me to keep standing, not to sit down or go to sleep . They checked in on me every so often, to see if I sat down or had fallen asleep, and if I had, they zapped me aga in with high voltage, and even if I hadn't they wou ld zap me. Either way, I got it. If I had to go to the bathroom, I went in a corner and then they would slap me for that. The men in suits were brutal . Slapping me, shinning bright lights in my eyes, sho cking my body. . . it was sheer torture . They injected my arm with some drug and I slumped over. One of them cove red me up with a sheet and carried me to a black ca r, and the next thing I knew I woke up in a hotel room where I was told to shower, wash my hair and dress in the clothes they left for me. When I finished dressing, they took me to a dimly lit restaurant where Reagan was sitting in a candlelit booth, already eating. It was late and there weren' t any other people in the restaurant. Reagan smiled and took my left hand activating my touch program as he squeeze d it. He winked at me as he continued eating. I jus t sat with him, with the Secret Service waiting behind him, wh ile he ate. I was very out of it, and was having tr ouble focusing to keep myself together. My inner system of persona lities was programmed to never make a mistake in re gard to which personality was \"presenting.\" I was forewarne d by my controllers that if this ever happened it w ould be a fatal mistake and I was programmed to keep my inner personality system in check by an internal oversig ht committee that decided who was to be out in a split second snap of the fingers. It wasn't that I was s witched to the wrong personality for this event; I think, at that moment, I was just physically incapable of performi ng. Reagan said, \"You look beautiful as always.\" I smiled shy ly and he lifted his hand up, brushed my hair off m y shoulder and pushed on the side of my neck. I felt like my eyes rolled out of my head. He looked to the Secret Service agents and said that he didn't think I was \"quite ready . \" The Secret Service agents took me outside into the ocean air and walked me around a bit and then took me back to him. They said, \"Perform!\" and I sat dow n, this time more alert, bubbly and talkative! Finished eating by now, Reagan took my hand again a nd said, \"Let's get out of here.\" We walked through the kitchen and out the back door, with Secret Service agents before and after us, into a waiting limo. I asked him where Nancy was and he said, \"She's home where she belong s!\" He pulled my legs up over his lap as we drove a way and said, \"You're in for a real treat tonight.\" It was late at night when we pulled up in front of a big white hotel. We went in quickly, after a Secr et Service agent checked to make sure the lobby was clear. Reagan an d I went hand-in-hand to the elevator up to the sec ond floor. We followed the agent down the hall and waited as h e stopped in front of a room, while two other agent s guarded Reagan outside. There was a balcony off the room, a nd we could hear the surf. It wasn't the plushest o f rooms, but it was nice. Reagan took off the white summer coat I'd been given to wear and sat next to me on the bed. He started talking to me as he undid the back of my dress. He undressed me this time, revealing the sheer white l acy bra, panties and white nylons I had been given to wear. Reagan was aggressive this night. This was not typi cal behavior for him, as he was usually so passive. He pushed me back onto the bed and kissed me eagerly while I be gan undressing him, one button at a time. He was in a h urry and very passionate. I was surprised at how di fferent he was. He nibbled my ear, rubbed my navel to access t ouch programming, and I performed oral sex. While h e lay on his back, I climbed on top of him to bring him to o rgasm. Soon I lay down next to him, and we dozed of f to sleep. A few hours later, a Secret Service agent woke me u p and put his finger to his lips to keep me quiet s o I wouldn't wake up the President. The agent grabbed my clothes and shoes and took me to another room to dress. Th ey put me into a dark sedan and took me back to my hotel, the El Presidente. The next morning I woke up next to my husband in our hotel room, as if from a nap, feeling really strange, very tired, and out of it, but with no tr ace of memory of my time with Reagan. That evening my husband and I went to dinner with our friends and I was unable to think or do much more than eat my dinner and smile occasiona lly at someone as they spoke at the table. I did ma nage to stay awake through dinner but couldn't wait to go to sle ep. The next morning I woke exhausted and feeling i ll, but didn't"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"know why. Waking weary and worn out was such a comm on occurrence for me and I had no way of knowing wh y I was really tired. I just figured that being tired, dazed, and feeling ungrounded was the way I was bor n. I never was able to think past that thought in order to penetra te the amnestic barrier, until much later. Catalina Island I was used on Catalina Island, for sexual rendezvou s with Reagan and sometimes other public officials or entertainers. If Nancy didn't accompany Reagan to C atalina, it usually meant my use with him was for s ex. She accompanied him at times when business affairs were at hand and other people were present for meetings . If Ronnie would touch me on the hand or look at me, she would get upset. Quietly and off to the side, he would t ell me not to worry my pretty little head about her. I was progra mmed to have sex with Reagan at the Wrigley Mansion , the Zane Grey and other hotels on the island. It seems Reaga n was usually on the island anonymously; for securi ty purposes, no one was to know he was there. There were usually two Secret Service agents who escorted me to my as signment. We often walked to our destination on the island wh en it was only a short distance. They directed me w here to go and stayed behind me so that it would not appear th at they were with me. An agent delivered me to the hotel room to wait for Reagan. Reagan preferred for me to wait for him naked, but he told me each time how he wan ted me to be the next time and I did as instructed. The agents who delivered me were always waiting rig ht outside with the other agents when it was time t o go. Then, they delivered me back to my hotel room. When I loo ked at Reagan's body when he was naked he had a whi te flabby stomach and buttocks, not fat, just flabby a nd old looking. When I was scheduled to be with him , I was pre- instructed to put on five strategically located spr ays of Oscar de la Renta perfume - one spray on eac h side of my neck, one on each wrist and one in between my legs. He was very sensory oriented and my body had to be super clean. He often told me he liked how I smelled. Reagan literally lay on his back the whole time we were having sex and had me do him. It was always on e-on-one with him, usually quiet and sedate. No violence, no intensity. He liked for me to rub his back and the n help him on with his pajamas. At this point in the evening, I o ften felt like I was pampering and putting a child to bed, despite the fact that he was 40 years older than I was! He made sure everything was comfy and in place. It was fairly routine, never much variation. One night at the Wri gley Mansion, Reagan wanted me to pretend like I wa s forcing him to have sex with me. After the game, he put the stun gun to the small of my back . I never knew when it was coming with him because he would smile and all of a sudden I'd get zapped. Then I passed out, just sor t of fainted over on him and he would catch me and direct my bod y over next to him, and then he would turn away and go to sleep, but his body was still touching me. Sometimes the stun gun was placed at the base of my skull . Different places for different reasons. In the forehead it was meant to erase the mind file just used . Chronic Pain Over the years, I suffered from chronic pelvic pain and sharp stabbing pains that shot up through my v agina and rectum. I went to the doctor in an attempt to allev iate the cause, but by 1984 it was decided that a t otal hysterectomy was the only cure for my pain. I was 33 years old. After the surgery, the pain did lessen, but wasn't completely gone. At that time I was still unaware that I had b een abused but when I began to have flashbacks and memories of the extreme sexual abuse that I had endured my whol e life, the pain lessened. Once my hidden past was brought to conscious awareness, I healed and the pain went awa y for good. Secretive Meetings with the Owl I had to maneuver through lots of fairy tale progra mming like the following in order to gain access in to memory of experiences when I was used as a mind file for Henr y Kissinger at secret meetings. There was a fairy t ale about a beautiful redwood forest, but it wasn't real, it wa s only fantasy. It had beautiful giant trees with r ed bark and it was in the mountains. There was a beautiful fairy princ ess who visited there and she was allowed to becaus e she had special connections to the forest animals. She made friends with the great owl who watched over her an d kept her safe. He alerted her if there were any problems bec ause he was so big and so wise. He looked big to he r because she had taken the magic mushrooms just like Alice in th e Looking Glass and she couldn't tell if he was rea lly big or she"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"was just very tiny, but he could watch out for her. This fairy tale was intended to cover and scramble the real memory of a men's camp of sorts in the California r edwoods . There was a wooden box mounted on a tree with a special phone inside that the group of men who met there could call from. Henry needed me there to ass ist him with data. After the meetings during the day he would la yer in the fairy tales at night in an attempt to sc ramble my memory. Kissinger also met with George Bush at a place outd oors in the mountains that was like a men's camp . There was a large wooden building that they used for meetings. They slept in smaller sleeping cabins . I slept in a separate screened-in cabin and Henry put me into a mode to s tay there and not leave until he came to get me. He nry met with George Bush when he was Vice President, more than h e did with Reagan, who was President. This was beca use Henry and George had more in common on this particular endeavor and worked hand-in-hand on the projec t. Then Vice-President Bush, Kissinger, and a White Ho use correspondent met to decide what the White Hous e Correspondent was going to put out through the medi a to the public to insure success of their plans. H enry always had his strategies and accomplished a lot behind th e scenes by working through and directing other pol iticians or people connected to the White House. At another mee ting, Henry and George accessed my geographic locat ions file and gained access to information about certain fore ign countries. They would pick perfect strategic locations to star t wars and/or disputes they wanted in order to distra ct the American people and others about what they w ere really doing in an area . I would rattle off information about an area, des cribing it's climate, terrain, ocean access, mounta in access, etc., and I would keep going on with inform ation until they heard a location that would work f or their plans. Then they would say STOP and I would stop. Meetings took place there often. Kissinger Mind File Use During Bush's Vice Presiden cy and Presidency During Reagan's administration, Henry Kissinger and George Bush used me often in a mind file capacity. When Bush became President, my job didn't change - only the person holding the office of President did. One day Henry and I were at the White House and he shook hands wi th Vice-President George Bush. I was there for mind file use. They were talking about the Iran-Contra situation a nd Henry was telling George what to say publicly to cover their tracks. He had a lengthy conversation with Bush, te lling him \"key phrases\" to say when asked certain q uestions so they could keep their stories straight. George didn't like Henry smoking his cigar inside, but Henry smoked anyway . I guess Bush needed Henry's help so bad that he d idn't press the cigar issue any further. Henry fill ed my mind files with information to bring back to the Go vernor of California, who I believe at the time was Governor Deukmajian. We sat in wooden chairs with leather seats in front of Bush's desk. The floor in the room was wooden, with a large throw rug over it. There was a n American flag to our left - to Bush's right. Bush took his glasses on and off when he got upset or nervous. Dinners held to entertain important foreign leaders or politicians from our own country often involved Henry Kissinger. He was not one to be social, but attende d these dinners out of duty. If I was to target an individual in attendance, I often went with Henry. I was \"strateg ically\" seated next to him as well as the person th ey were trying to monitor or influence. Henry always briefed me be forehand in regard to things that were important to a foreign leader or a certain Senator or Congressmen. I would say sentences that had been implanted in my head t o draw them out and get them talking. Sometimes I was given little white pills to drop in their wineglasses to \"help them loosen up a little ,\" is what Henry would say. At these dinners, the President would clink his gla ss with a fork or spoon and propose a toast to the honored guest. All the presidents did it. Tapping of the wineglass was a means to call me to attention; most often it was a time when a very specific code was introduced to set me up for what I was to do the rest of the evening. Af ter they clinked the glass, I subconsciously received the di rections carefully embedded in the toast. Although Henry was the mastermind and loaded me up with information for ta rgeted people for the evening, the Presidents were always told that I was at their service for the evening when I was included at a dining arrangement. Henry really had his own agenda that I fulfilled within the evening, minglin g with those persons he pre-directed me to. But he took the courtesy of letting the Presidents feel they were i n charge of me, so my instructions were to listen w ith an ear to hear the coded instructions and file them in with t he instructions Henry had given me for the evening. Although I didn't understand consciously what to do, the coded parts inside of me knew exactly what to do and wha t area within the personality structure would carry out th e duty. The Presidents I worked with knew exactly who I was ,"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"and knew that as a robot , I needed direction while I was sitting at the din ing table with the guests. They gave me direction in relation to foreign leaders and which to target and what information to go after. If ther e were two foreign dignitaries then I would be told what to do with each of them. Bush utilized me often like thi s to hunt out information or find where loyalties lay. Some of the guests at different times were royalty from England , foreign ambassadors , and other leaders from around the world. They often had interpreters with them at dinner so they could communicate. Henry put key phrases in my mind files, created especially for th em because my knowledge of foreign languages was li mited, but later, sex usually bridged the language barrier . I was told what to say when questioned. Sometimes I said I was working for the State Department. Some of the men must have been given prior permission to have me se xually because they would touch my leg under the ta ble or slip their hand up my dress. These men thought they were being given a gift, but they were really being interrogated or seeded by a programmed operative who had been well trained to do just that sort of job interwoven with sex. Sometimes it was just quick sex in a back office an d then they would go home with their wife, or somet imes me. When I was to spend the night with a guest, we were often limoed to a nearby hotel for the evening. Th is happened when the men in control wanted some serious informa tion. At other times, my instructions were merely t o sit next to a targeted guest, deliver preprogrammed messages an d record in my mind files their responses, reaction s, etc. Once a Machine, Always a Machine! At times, Bob met and played golf with George Bush. \"Once a machine always a machine,\" Bob said about me to Bush on the golf course in Palm Springs. Bush told Bob he acted like an old married couple with me. Bo b laughed and said, \"There's nothing old about her!\" Bush did n't think it was so funny and just went on to the n ext hole in silence, followed by Secret Service agents. George Bush knew all about my use as a human computer . He treated me very unkindly, like I wasn't human. One day, Henry and George got into a fierce argumen t over how George treated me. Henry said, \"Would you go over to an ex pensive computer and kick it if it malfunctioned?\" This was during Bush's Vice-Presidency when George accessed my files often and participated back and forth with Greenspan and Kissinger during that time. Henry sai d, \"George if you're going to use the equipment you 're going to have to learn to use it properly.\" George said to H enry, \" Hank, this young woman is nothing but a piece of equipment and if she continues to malfunction on me , I'll have to put a stop to her use .\" I sat blankly while they continued their argument. The Game of Life or is it Slow Death? George Bush was always mean, gruff and degrading . Overtime, he continually gave me brutal 'attitude adjustments.' He knew just how to twist the knife p sychologically and could get me 'back in line' quic ker than anyone else, due to the fact that he had abused my daughter and could devastate me by reminding me of the brutal things he did to her . Or he would say, \"I can read you like a book and don't ever forget it. If you ever get a notion in your head like this again your daughter will be mot herless. Don't cross me again.\" He was always yelling at me . He also started this program about 'life.' I had eaten LIFE cereal my whole life as part of a program, an d he said to eat it and remember while I was eating it that, \"only by g oing along with the program will you stay alive and continue your duties to your family and country.\" In program med response, I ate LIFE cereal all the time, even carrying little snack bags of it around with me if I felt scared or threatened. Bush also had my children play the gam e of LIFE with me and reminded us, \"Spin the dial and see what lif e has to offer.\" George would remind us to remember whenever we played, \"if you get off track, you will loose no t only your own life, but the precious lives of tho se traveling with you, your children.\" (Or, in my children's case, \"y our mother or father.\") Henry was so busy perfecting and guarding his technology within me that, at the time, I experienced him as protecting me, since he personally wasn't violent w ith me. But I know now that he was very much a part of the group of people that hurt me and, in fact, had to h ave orchestrated a lot of my high-level abuse . At times Henry acted like a mad scientist, so pleased with his cre ation, yet lost to humanity. Mexico"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":" Lots of drug transactions took place in the middle of crowds, such as in parades. I was involved in a big one in Mazatlan on Cinco de Mayo. We had just eaten dinner with Craig's family, aunt, uncle and cousin at the Shrimp Bucket restaurant. They had a lot of alcohol to dri nk and Craig's aunt took me into the restroom and p assed some drugs off to me and told me to put the bag inside m y dress. I was wearing a peach colored cotton sundr ess and I did what she said but didn't like to put the package in my panties like she told me to because it made me look pregnant or fat. Soon, we all left the restaurant and steppe d out into the street where a festive Cinco de Mayo parade was in full swing. As we entered the huge crowd of people dancing and marching in the street, we moved along helplessly sandwiched in between the crowd. Craig kept laughin g hysterically and smashed confetti eggs in my hair . I was terrified because nothing felt real, and the loud n oises and all the people jammed close together frig htened me. A man with dark skin, wearing white cotton pants, s hirt and straw hat grabbed my arm and pulled me awa y from the crowd, down a dark side street. He pulled me throug h what at first looked like a doorway into an old a bandoned building but as we made our way to the back, I was escorted into a room that was restored and decorate d. A group of men were sitting around a table with a low hangi ng lamp, smoking and playing cards. \"Here she is,\" my guide announced. Another dark-skinned man came over to me . I think they called him Johnny T . He patted my stomach and said, \"What do we have here? A gold mine?\" He p ulled up my dress and removed the package. In front of all the other men, he set his cigar down, pulled off hi s belt, unzipped his pants, let them fall to the fl oor, stepped out of them and said to his comrades, \"This is what I've w aited all night for.\" And he pulled me to the groun d and raped me in front of the group. When he was through with me he opened the package I had delivered and said, \" Tell the United States government, we thank them for their g ifts, for their generosity, and tell them we like t he way they do business ,\" everyone laughed as he continued, \" and that we will continue to hold up our end of the bargain .\" Another man took me out to a waiting car and I was delivere d back to Craig's uncle. George Bush was often a part of the illegal drug activity in Me xico . It felt as if he followed me and my family around on our vacations; no matter where we went, h e and \"the boys,\" showed up. I realize now our vaca tion spots really revolved around our controller's agenda but in those days I had no way of knowing that. It seem ed like Reagan was just a puppet and Bush made all the arra ngements, did the thinking, planning and carrying o ut of the deals. At meetings and social gatherings, Bush made the connections and cut the deal while Reagan just acted oblivious - which is not to say he didn't know or w asn't aware, he just wasn't ever the mastermind. Bush was ruthless and brutal; the end justified the means . He even had a red handkerchief he kept in his pocke t for wiping blood off of Kelly or me . He had high expectations and often expected us to do things that he had inadvertently forgotten to tell us, at which point Kelly or I got slapped, beaten, or dealt with in other torturous ways. There was a time on Maui when a Secret Service agent came to my aid saying to Bush , \" Sir, I don't think you told her that .\" That was the end of his job; Bush fired him on the spot . One day Bush took a pocketknife out of his pants pocket and I was terrified that he would use it on me, but inste ad he used it to cut the skin off a green apple. He told me I'd be next to have my skin cut off in the same slow, tort urous manner if I didn't cooperate. I saw the Mexican leaders more frequently at the Wh ite House than in Mexico ; they were usually brutal and violent . Craig's Uncle Lyle Curran , who worked for NASA , specially arranged for us to purchase a timeshare ; the Presidential Suite, at the El Cid Hotel, in Mazatla n. My husband purchased the use of this suite, for the same week in April, every year for the next 25 years. My family and I always thought we were going there for a vacation. But that was never what occurred. O n one such vacation, a man in a suit met Kelly and I just afte r we had bought our 'strawberry banana smoothies' a t the hotel shake stand. Later I discovered that these drinks, although very healthy, were programming cues that w ere installed at an earlier time when we were taken to the Santa Monica Pier and put on the Carousel Ride. A man put both of us on the horses and told us, \"tied together, you are one.\" There was other mirror programming and sugges tions that created confusion over where I started or ended phy sically, and Kelly began or ended. There were to be no separate identities. Anyway, we had on our bikinis and this suited man followed us over the bridged overpass th at led to the Presidential Suite. As we went into the room he sli pped in behind us. He told us to sit down on the be d. He put earphones on both of us, and injected our forearms. Kelly sat with one leg folded under her, in half I ndian style position. We were body programmed and different bod y positions meant different things. George Bush arr ived, dressed in a tan suit, and Kelly was \"prepared\" for him. Bush, a couple of Mexican leaders, and one ot her man had a"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"meeting in our suite. I sat next to Bush at the mee ting while he accessed my mind files. When the meet ing was over George waited until everyone left the room, shook t heir hands politely at the door and when they were gone he went into the bedroom where Kelly was waiting. I sat rob otically at the table. Awhile later, when Kelly cam e out of the room, she had a smile on her face. Per programmed c onditioning, she always wore a smile but she didn't look good to me. Bush left with two Secret Service agents tha t were parked outside the door to the suite. One of them called him, \"Geo .\" Another time Henry Kissinger was sitting with Ge orge Bush at a meeting that took place at the large dining table in our Presidential Suite at El Cid wi th two Mexican men. I was there to be used in mind file capacity. There were other such meetings that took place at o ur family timeshare, at El Cid, in the \"Presidentia l Suite.\" \"Honesty is the first chapter of the book of wisdom .\" -- Thomas Jefferson Chapter Twenty-nine Back to the Future More High Tech Classified Projects In 1985, after a head-on collision and the ensuing healing process necessitated by the auto accident, my direction and course were irrevocably altered. I left my posi tion in my husband's dental practice, returned to c ollege and attended Pepperdine University in Malibu to begin c lasses to fulfill the requirements for a degree in Psychology. But as always, in addition to the coursework leadin g to my degree was an alternate, hidden agenda, pla nned and orchestrated by my controllers. Along with attendin g classes at Pepperdine, I was used in the Malibu a rea for experiments that furthered parapsychology research, as well. At Pepperdine there were experiments and research o n the nature of higher consciousness, how the brain intercepts thought, why some brains process higher thought and others don't, how pure diet and water effects the brain, the effects of meditation on the brain, remote viewing and out-of-body experiments. I was programmed to me et with a group in a small room at the University where we wa tched movies. My attendance was carefully tied to m y use in the projects and with Ronald Reagan. There were others in the room robotically watching the movies. They treated us like monkeys . Telepathic Experiments Among other things at Pepperdine, tests were done o n studying and learning in altered states of consci ousness. I began reading endless books on psychic phenomena an d began being psychically trained and further exper imented on. Each day at lunch I reported to the large cross that graces the hillside at the University, in ord er to sit in the small area inside and go into a meditative state. I did this each and every day and felt as if I was c ommunicating with the whales and dolphins in the vast ocean that spanned the panoramic view from that location. Part of the experiments focused on telepathic commu nication and my controllers were sending messages t o me via satellite systems to see if I could pick them up. T hey tasked me with these assignments that had to be performed in the ocean or near the ocean so it would be easier t o pick up the telepathic messages sent over the air waves that they were broadcasting to me. There were times I conscio usly thought I was just going to go for a drive, to have the day to myself, when in reality I was instructed and dir ected to different locations. One day I drove into a remote canyon high in the hills above Malibu. I positioned myself on top of a mountain in my beach chair and sat all by myself and read a book on Edgar Cayce . When I looked to the sprawling mountaintops, my e yes focused on all sorts of satellite dishes and instrumentation on the hill in front of me. After spending a few hours there I re turned to my home in Agoura Hills. Later that day, the phone ran g. I picked it up and a man asked me questions befo re saying, \"We see you picked up the message about where to go today and followed our instructions impeccably. Go od work and be waiting for the next set of instructions.\" C lick, he hung up. Robotically I hung up the phone a nd went on like nothing had happened. Immediately this slice of rea lity submerged itself deep within the programmed re cesses of"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"my mind, and was kept there until a later time when I was reaccessed. There were many places I was tel epathically directed to in response to messages sent to me by m y controllers. Often I was led to believe that incarnate guides and masters were leading me when I was really being led by the men who were instilling these thoughts in order to direct me to various places where they wanted me . Further Adventures Along the California Coast The American government seemed to be willing to sel l anything, including children, to foreign countries in order t o gain monies to fund the mind control and other re search projects . Reagan presented it saying that it was the only way we wou ld survive - that we would all be killed by nuclear destruction at the hands of these \"foreign morons\" unless we were able to have more control, and the m ind control projects insured American safety. He made it sound like something the United States had to have to sta y a safe and free nation. But the Council knows the bigger picture lies beyond what Reagan thought was \"national security.\" It was really an international takeover by a group of megalomania cs who have decided to insure the future for their own genetically advanced progeny . From my perspective, it had nothing to do with Am erican freedom or safety. But Reagan was a pawn and didn't have all the infor mation or know about the Council's higher agenda. I f he had, he would have known the United States was being duped. Reagan sent for me and I was picked up, once again at noontime, while I was 'meditating' under the cro ss at Pepperdine, in order to be taken for demonstration to men from all over. They were usually small group s because Henry or the Council was working that angle, too, p utting together different foreign scientists or for eign leaders who would naturally be competitive so they could ge t the most out of them. Often Reagan, or a military officer, would explain the project to them as a group and th ey would toy with their national pride and play off their natural competitiveness and ego . Then after the meeting, one of our people would tak e them aside, into a separate room and tell them we were interested but that such and such a country (Saudi Arabia for example) had more to o ffer . They worked them like that to get more cooperation in hopes that maybe the leader or scientist would o ffer more favors, resources, connections, etc., so we would get even more out of the deal . Henry really knew how to work people, and he knew how to be very convincing. He told Reagan and others that it was all for natio nal security, American safety, and these men all believed it, the y all thought Henry was so smart and so pro-America n, but he never really was. He just talked that way to get pe ople to do what he and the Council wanted. \"Reagan isn't a robot, but he might as well be,\" Kissinger said. I'm not s o sure. During the 80's I was keyed to a computer in my bed room, where I began to get instructions at home fro m the Council. I didn't think I was very good at computers since I'd taken a computer class and felt I really couldn 't learn the technology. But while the \"I,\" the conscious pa rt of my personality, was unaware of my computer pr oficiency, other parts were completely in tune! Upon awakening , before I brushed my teeth, I was instructed to re port to my computer. It displayed a symbol if I had instructio ns and was to continue for further instructions. Th ey made it simple for me to access. There were codes for 'regu lars,' people I met with weekly, like some of the m ovie stars in Malibu and Beverly Hills. I was given schedules and lists of people to meet , or to be expecting to meet, and dates to be at certain places at certain times , so I would know to have my hair done, nails polis hed, what time, location, etc. I didn't any longer have to report to the room at the Holiday Inn ; I could get my instructions from home. After the mid 80's, my controllers began accessing me more directly without Craig being so much in cha rge. They took more direct control. Often my instructions wer e to wait in meditation beneath the cross at the Un iversity. I was used heavily during this time, and spent less and l ess time with my family. Men in suits or men that l ooked and dressed like they were gardeners at Pepperdine woul d come up to me and give me messages while I was in a meditative state. Later, men in suits would pick me up, tapping me in code on my shoulder two or three times, after which I would get up and go with them. This particu lar time, the men drove me to weapons warehouses wh ere I delivered detailed messages to arms dealers and rec orded their responses to take back. Lots of foreign countries' arms 'deals' took place in warehouses, at least the original dealings . After that I would take the message back and deliver it that night wherever I was directed. Then I would return home in the evening to my family, h aving thought I had 'studied' in the university library the whole day. Fat chance! Mind Control Adventures "},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"An Iran-Contra arms trade took place in a warehouse in Santa Monica. Nothing was ever to have been tra ced back to Reagan because it was to have been a covert oper ation to raise funds for other projects, \"research projects.\" They felt justified in selling arms to anyone, including our enemies, because they felt that the days of ar med conflict were over . Instead we could now win wars using our high tech p sychological, chemical and electronic warfare , if we ever needed to, and be able to use mind control technologies to insure the enemy laid down their weapons . But in the meantime, we could sell them comparatively obsolete weapons and make money for furthering the research in mind control . Lots of drug and arms deals took place in warehouse s in California, especially in and near Santa Monic a and Malibu. A lot of foreign connections were made in o rder to increase the funds for the continuation of the research projects. And they used the mind controlled robots they had created to earn money for them. Many, many people are under mind control and have been working for th em for years - men and women who are dentists, attorneys, stockbrokers, doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists , politicians, bankers, corporate heads, engineers, newspaper editors or owners, nurses, teachers, principals , etc. etc. etc. And all these programmed people ar e used to further \"the cause,\" each placed in strategic positions for use by the Council. The technology available is so advanced that most people couldn't even dream of it. It far surpasses anything yet seen on sci-fi movies or read about in books – total automation, even of people. They put mind control operatives into jobs that inc luded travel and then used them internationally to further their cause. They felt there was no way that they couldn' t succeed since so many are now under their complet e control and are able to be controlled by universal signals, enabling them to put certain words, phrases, or sy mbols into the current media (movies, television, newpapers, music , etc.) and the mind-controlled robots are programm ed to step up their pace. Certain words have been paired throu gh programming to different tasks these robots are assigned to do. So all they have to do is to hear the word comb inations, tones, frequency, etc., and they can all be commanded within a very short time to carry out their program med instructions. Fun in the Sun? At other times I would report to Zuma Beach and thi nk I spent the day relaxing in the sun by myself. I n actuality I climbed out of my beach chair and walked out into t he surf, swam into the waves, sometimes for long di stances, easily and effortlessly, as my programming commande d, to meet a boat just outside the wave break. A ma n in the boat who helped me on board, dripping wet, handed m e a towel and once said, \"My, but you must be an im portant person.\" I couldn't comprehend or respond because I was in total program and this event 'wasn't really happening.' He drove me to Point Mugu and apologized when due t o large surf conditions he couldn't get in closer w hen we neared the rear entrance. I told him not to worry t hat I was used to swimming long distances and was a dept at swimming waves. I told him I'd just use the waves t o get me in easily. I had a program that rendered m y body incapable of feeling the temperature of the water, so I could enter very cold water and not get cold. So I dove off the boat in my bikini and swam to shore. There were som e pens and an underwater screen that I knew to swim around to get to the shore. I walked onto the beach area, to the cement and the chain link fence, then waited until a man in a white naval uniform let me in and escorted me to an outside shower they used when they swam. He took m e inside to a bathroom, where I found a naval uniform, white blouse with navy blue and gold trim, and a white s kirt and navy blue heels neatly piled up for me to wear. My hair was trimmed every 4 weeks so that I could just run my fingers through it and it would look okay, since it was naturally curly. The same officer took me through an area where they used a metal scanner on me for security purposes a nd I had to pass through a light monitor and did so with flying colors. Then I was escorted in to see whomever I w as to report to - an officer, Commander, Reagan or sometimes Bus h. But this time I was there to meet Reagan and to be demonstrated to a group of foreign scientists they wanted to recruit for research. I was put into a cl ear cylindrical capsule, maybe for show, and then Reagan showed the se men how I reacted upon command. He demonstrated the use of my mind files by quickly asking me for detai led information and descriptions of schematics. I p erformed up to speed, dictating to them the elaborate 3-D holog raphic craft images that I was viewing in my head. All the men clapped. In the beginning they had to condition me to the clapping because it flipped me out and switc hed me, and then I would be surprised to find myself where I wa s. Usually after the demonstrations were finished, Reagan would limo me out with him and we went for a quick sexual encounter somewhere, locally. Later, they put me i nto another"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"car and dropped me back at the beach, where I chang ed once again into my bikini. Lying on my beach cha ir, enjoying the California sun, I obeyed my program th at commanded, \"Slowly come out of the meditative st ate.\" Later when I returned home I would stand in front o f my computer and hit the buttons I was programmed to select in order to type in a message or answer from Reagan or whomever I had been with, so Henry would get th e message. I don't know how it worked but there would often be an instant reply typed back on the screen , coupled with a command to \"erase the day, that it was a rel axing day in the sun and surf.\" Working Girl There were times I was taken by the life guard boat to Point Mugu and escorted to a Captain's quarters to be used. They gave me other clothes to wear and then helicop tered me to Reagan's Ranch, usually for meetings wi th foreign leaders. And when Henry wasn't there (he often wasn 't), I was there standing in for him, but the atten dees thought I was a secretary to Reagan. Reagan relied on informa tion I had in my mind files, put there for his acce ss by Kissinger. Kissinger ran large portions of the fore ign diplomacy of the United States Government by se nding me to these meetings. Over the years when people like Rebozo, Sinatra and Bush wanted to take me out (kill me), Henry would stop it because he and the Council had worked years, even decades, to set up the conne ctions I had with people . Henry had key robots in key situations so that everyone w as working in perfect three-part harmony . I had been put close to U.S. government leaders, British royalty, Margaret Thatcher , and leaders of other countries, and these relationships were \"seasoned w ith time,\" Henry would say, and so he wanted to kee p me in as long as possible. Henry said these relationships were priceless because the se contacts knew and trusted me over time, with no ill effects, so in the future they wo uld share information with me about more important things without worry . Henry had me tested often, especially after the a ccident and when I began psychotherapy full time. I was breaking down but they were building me back up in other directions without my missing a beat in my as signments. My personalities who were close to foreign leaders had not had the accident and were cut off from that experience. Instead they enjoyed total health and well being in order to continue their work. Different personalit ies had been created for different leaders so Henry could easily instill new information or messages, yet retain th e personality as it had been created especially for the individual l eaders. I was flown by helicopters that took off from naval ships out at sea, into foreign countries to be the connection maker for munitions or drug transactions with vario us countries - Columbia, Bolivia, Mexico, Jamaica - I can't remember them all. But I was dressed in a military uniform and flown in helicopters down into these pl aces to deliver messages, usually to a man in uniform who w as heavily guarded. But here again, they didn't have a clue that our country possessed weaponry that looked lik e anything but weapons - that couldn't even be seen : invisible weapons that could drop people to their k nees and render them incapable of functioning . No need to kill them, just send targeted energy and control th eir brain wave activity . I remembered a time when the pilot called to a fore ign bank to see if the money was in the account bef ore he would release the sale of weapons. Money was made not onl y on the sale of the weapons, but even more on the financial arrangements made that created huge revenues from t he interest on the loans to desperate countries, wi lling to pay whatever it took to save the lives of their people. So they paid top dollar for the weapons and paid i nterest on the loans in addition. All this was planned, down to the instigation of wa rs that would create an international weapons market . It also kept nations busy buying obsolete weapons A merica said were the best . We kept them looking the other way as we were secretly using the copious pro fits from the sales to fund more mind control resea rch, so the plan for the world takeover could be implemented. A ll this was done by very smart and manipulative peo ple who used very strategic planning. Saudi Arabia and other foreign countries inadvertently funded a lot of NASA research and, when there were arms embargoes or other embar goes, all it meant was the price was forced up and the United States made even more money. Point Mugu Demonstrations "},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"After demonstrations at the circular arena in Point Mugu, Reagan left in a limo with Secret Service ag ents flanking him heavily because of the assassination attempt. I was escorted out and after the agents put Reagan i nto the back of the limo, one of the agents took the passenger spot in the front seat opposite the driver and gave him instructions on where to go. Then, after some of the agents left to report to their next duty, a remaining agent opene d the back door and put me in next to Reagan and we were off. The g lass was put up between the front and back seats be fore I got in. Reagan became very good at saying things to me in order that I might feel like he was being polite , when he was really getting around the fact that I wasn't allowe d to eat. One day we were taken to a fish restauran t in Malibu on a Monday, when the restaurant was normally closed, bu t they opened it for the opportunity of serving the President. Reagan went in first with a phalanx of Secret Servi ce agents flanking him on all sides. You couldn't e ven see him in the group and after he was seated in a secluded boo th in the back I was brought in and they told the w aiter I was his visiting niece. With a towel on his arm, the waiter asked Reagan, \"And what will the young lady be eat ing this afternoon?\" Reagan looked at me and I said, \"Thanks , but I've already eaten.\" Then he made some joke a bout it as he began eating his fish, carrots, rice and salad. I sat and smiled at him while he ate, and listened intently. When he was finished, the Secret Service took care of the b ill and he was escorted back out to the limo in the same way he went into the restaurant - then they put me back be side him. Our next destination was a grouping of sm all rustic cottages along Pacific Coast Highway. The driver dr ove around back and the Secret Service agents went to the room first, opened it, checked it out, and then came bac k to the car. opened my door, escorted me in, shut the door and I waited, parked in robotic mode, while they Reagan i n. After the agents left the room, Reagan commented th at he liked the place, that it reminded him of the Ranch. He took my right hand and asked, \"Should we do our dan ce?\" \"You bet,\" I answered. So he twirled me around several times, for programming purposes and then laid me on the bed. I was wearing a white pantsuit with fancy tassels on the front and short white boots. He had given me a Reagan watch to wear for the day, but later the age nts took it away. Reagan loved the watch. He unbuttoned my shir t as he lay on the bed next to me and went directly for my belly button and began tracing his fingers around m y navel. Waiting for my programming to kick in, he laid on his back for me to satisfy him. Afterwards, he took a s hort nap and then sent me out to notify the agent w ho was waiting in the limo. The agent snapped to attention and directed the driver to get into position, and they escorted Reagan back to the limo. We took off down Pacific Coast Highway again and th ey stopped to drop me off at a gas station in Malib u, where I met a man in an unmarked car who drove me back to t he cross at Pepperdine. When he let me out he said, \"Weren't you meditating?\" In response, I robotically walked under the cross and sat there again. He yelled, \"No t too long!\" and drove off. I stood up, totally unaware I had be en with anyone, thinking I had only been in deep me ditation for a long time. I found my car and drove through the can yon home where, with the help of our maid, I prepar ed dinner. I was pretty out of it. I was used with Reagan hundreds of times if not mor e, ever since I was a teenager. He knew that I had to have time in between when he used my mind files for demonstra tion or information and sex. So having a leisurely lunch provided the time necessary. A cue or signal had to be given to shut down the mind files and then, fro m that time on, a certain amount of time had to elapse before s ex. Once he was President, the Pepperdine cross ser ved as a pick- up point where I was taken to cabins, cottages, or out of the way homes to be with him sexually after the Council had input me with information for him via my home c omputer. Many messages were phoned to me by Bob, or more often Henry, when they were of a political nature, because political details were more complicated and took more time than the simple well-grooved routines of sexua lly satisfying stars or political friends of Bob's. In the early 80's I also rendezvoused with Reagan f or sex on nights I drove off by myself in the car, telling my husband I needed to learn to become more independen t. I got in my car and played the 'metaphysical gam e' I learned from books I was suggested to read. For exa mple, I just drove spontaneously and magically stop ped when it 'felt right.' One evening, it just 'tell right' to stop at a very expensive hotel in Santa Barbara and I checked into a room and waited for Ronnie. Naturally, before he go t there two men in suits, carrying briefcases full of programming equipment, let themselves into my hotel room and tortured me in preparation for the Presid ent. Another time it just 'felt right' to stop at a larg e hotel near the pier in Santa Monica, where again, I met with Reagan. Point Mugu Naval Weapons Station and Dolphins I rem embered being on a gurney at Point Mugu, with a whi te sheet over my body, a white electrode cap over my h ead and an IV in my arm. I was hooked up to electro des all"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"over my scalp and on my wrists and they were having me listen to whale and dolphin sounds via headsets . Huge banks of audio equipment and big tapes on recorders were all running. They often played music or sound s in one ear and tones or word instructions in the other. Sometimes the sound was excruciatingly loud in one ear and nearly inaudible in the other . The words were barely audible but I often tried rea lly hard to listen to what was being played in my ear, though it was impossible to hear . The loudness hurt my ear and the two extremes coupl ed together nearly drove me crazy. There were dolphins in tanks at Point Mugu that wer e also used in research. At times, they also had el ectrodes on their heads. I think they were attempting to measur e thoughts and telepathic communication. At one poi nt they directed me to send a message to the dolphin with m y mind, and then listen and decode the language of the dolphin's reply. They tried it with whale language also. The swim programs that allowed me to swim lon g distances without tiring, were also coupled with the hypnotic suggestion that I was like a dolphin and could swi m forever like one. I think the dolphin research was a secondary p roject, and among other things was a project to fur ther U.S. Intelligence technology in telepathy. The dolphin r esearch continued because we could communicate long distance with the dolphins, sending messages, and when I rec eived them, I was given a number to call immediatel y to report what I heard. They paired this need to report with having to go to the bathroom and once in the bathro om I would dissociate, switch personalities and phone in to re port, sort of like \"ET phone home.\" Just a week before my husband and I were getting re ady to go on a sailing trip to the Channel Islands, I remembered performing a visualization I was taught, where in m y mind, I pictured myself in the middle of a group of dolphin. I performed this whole process in an attempt to actua lly link up with the dolphin on our trip. Before we left, I told Craig I was going to have a dolphin experience! Low and behold, way out in the middle of the Pacific O cean, a whole pod of dolphin swarmed our boat. When I saw t hem coming I got so excited that I slipped on my di ving mask, and jumped off the boat into the middle of th em. No one on board could believe my impulsive acti ons! It seemed that time stood still and I felt like I was held in a state of suspended animation as one large dolphin seemed to energetically link up with me. Time seemed to st and still and it was an amazing experience! After t hat I began to \"see light in everything.\" I still don't have an un derstanding for exactly what happened, but I began having incredibly prophetic dreams and more psychic experi ences . I believe this also was part of an experiment. There was extensive \"dolphin programming\" done on m e. Movies, stills and motion pictures with beautifu l music were shown, administered together with drugs they i njected into my arm in order to put me in a state o f utter euphoria while I was viewing the dolphin pictures. These movies and other positive stimuli reinforced good feelings that emerged in order to deter me from the Star War s information. Dolphin programming covered the Star Wars Project. Whales covered a NASA project. This all-po werful programming was meant to keep me from access ing the information stored neatly in my brain away from my conscious awareness. There were movies I felt drawn to all of a sudden l eave my family at night to attend. I went to differ ent new age bookstores or other places where I was told to go t o see dolphin movies, some very sophisticatedly cre ated with music. A couple who created and traveled to share t heir dolphin movie, told the small audience to go i nto a meditative state and watch the film in order to gai n expanded consciousness. The movie contained diffe rent geometric shapes shown along with the dolphins in u nderground cities. The dolphin theme was continued when I was living on the island of Kauai. President Reagan 's project, STAR WARS, was located in my mind files under Dolphin programming. I accompanied Reagan lots of t imes to Point Mugu and other military bases, but Po int Mugu was the original site where I would download top se cret information from the mind files, first. Then I was taken to different bases all over, usually without Reagan, t o deliver the same information, over and over and o ver again; all over the world to the major players. The Around the World In 80 Days movie and song was used to cover this activity. So I'd think of that movie and believe I was remembering that instead of my actual assignmen t. Other movies were used in an attempt to cover and intenti onally scramble my experiences. As I retrieved memo ry of ways I was used, I sorted through the 'movie realities' to discover what actually happened. Star Wars was a global network working together for global c ontrol . This network continued as I was transferred to the island of Kauai where I reported often to Barki ng Sands Missile Base. Dolphin Programming and Pornography "},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Another auxiliary project, one that brought in proc eeds, was dolphin pornography . Dolphin porn was filmed in Malibu and in the dolphin tanks at Point Mugu. It w as convenient because they had cages already built and so the dolphins could be housed there for use almost anyti me. Reagan really loved the dolphin stuff . He watched a porn video of Kelly and I with a couple of dolphins . During the viewing he smiled, patted my leg and s aid, \"I'll be with you later.\" He wasn't into sex with children and didn't have sex with my daughter. When the fil m was over he said, \"Watching you do underwater ballet is beautiful, bu t seeing you with the dolphin is out of this world! \" He laughed and looked up, like he was seeing a missile or shut tle launch. Lots of dolphin porn was filmed. I believe Bob gave copies of it to Prince Charles , Prince Phillip and Margaret Thatcher, who is a lesbian . Over the years my daughter Kelly was often programm ed next to me. We would be instructed to both touch our noses at the same time and then a shock would be de livered though the electrodes stuck all over our bo dies. We both had IV's in our arms and despite the trauma, w e were giggling like we were both drunk. She was ve ry young and they continued this over the years. In addition to all the regular programming, they also programm ed us to be a mother-daughter sex team. There was lots of program ming laid in that made us believe that we were twin souls, \"two peas in a pod.\" I was programmed to believe th at half of me was in her and half of her was in me. There was lots of identity confusion. They programmed us to b e totally synchronous, so we could flow together an d work harmoniously while sexually servicing whomever they sent us to. Our controllers' used the movie ET as a \"screen memory\" to cover memory of these actu al experiences by telling Kelly and I that we were like ET and Elliot, and if one of us got free the other would die. The messag e given was, \" If you get deprogrammed or a hospital frees you, yo u will get separated from each other for the rest o f your lives . ET almost died and had to go to another planet away from Elliott. A wilted Chrysanthemum flower plant will remind you, it will wither and die if it's off the vine, away from its source.\" At three months old Ke lly was able to float on her back with no assistance, and further s wimming lessons early on enabled her to be an excel lent swimmer, natural in the water. She also had program ming that enhanced her natural swimming capabilitie s, enabling her to swim long distances. Kelly was good with the dolphins. She was specially trained this way from the time she was very small. Years later, in 1993, as I became aware that my chi ldren and I had been taken to Point Mugu for progra mming, I returned, trying to get a closer look in an attempt to understand what these people were doing. But it was heavily guarded; now I know why. Interestingly enough, last year on a plane flight, I had the opportunity to s it next to a man from California. I was spiritually guided to sh are with him my experience of programming at Point Mugu Naval Base. When I got to the part about the dolphi n tanks and banks of recording equipment, his eyes widened and he said, \"You must have been there; no one knows ab out those unless they have been there; it's a class ified area.\" After our conversation he just kept shaking his hea d. My family and I bounced from Point Mugu to UCLA for programming often, and when necessary were taken t o Edwards Air Force Base for further programming. The Star-Spangled Banner Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gl eaming. Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the pe rilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly stre aming. And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in ai r, Gave proof through the night that our flag was stil l there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave . Yeah, it still waves, but not over the land of the free and the home of the brave. \"Fear them not therefore: For there is nothing cove red that shall not be revealed; nothing hid, that shall not be known. \" -- Matthew 10:26 "},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":" Brice Taylor - Thanks for the Memories, pp 237-240 Chapter Thirty UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute Is It East or West? I experienced many, many episodes of brainwashing, mind control, electroshock and tortures of the mind at the University of California at Los Angeles, Neuropsychiatric Institute in West wood. Their involvement was the government's insurance that I would remain function al and amnestic of my use. Dr. Louis Jolyon 'Joly' West's horrific expertise was involved so that I could be used at the highest levels over the years without r isk of my breaking down and remembering. Henry sent me with m essages to give Dr. West , with instruction in regard to things within me that he wanted checked out. Bob Ho pe didn't have that connection, only Henry had acce ss to West. I reported there for years but began going regularl y after Craig got into University of Southern Calif ornia Dental School in 1973 and we made the connection in Westwo od with Dr. Milo Brooks, my original childhood pediatrician. Nurses there checked me and wrote notes in regard t o my pulse, eye movement, foot responses, etc. In a n attempt to scramble and confuse my conscious mind as to who Dr . West actually was, he would cross his arms and po int in both directions saying, \" Is it east or is it west .\" And even now when someone asks me for directions and mentions east or west I become momentarily confused and can' t give them the directions. Dr. West also programme d me to the red and green freeway on and off ramp signals, by hypnotically suggesting that when I saw the sign upon entering Westwood it would make me switch to the pe rsonality who had the information and knew where to go to report into the hospital. After my visit, when I sa w the signal on my way home, the sign was to remind me to forget what happened. I was never allowed to walk near or ever act like I knew Dr. West when I saw him walking in the corridor of the Neuropsychiatric Institute . I was instructed to walk by him with no recognition whatsoever . He was a very large, heavy man, the \"big wig\" around t here, and seemed to be in charge of everything and everybody . I was programmed to report there to see his doctors f or many years. There was a younger doctor who put m e in an examination room and did lots of neurological testi ng on me and checked my responses to make sure I wa s still reacting within the normal range. He also directed me to walk into the hall and go into a bathroom and wait for him. When he arrived he had sex with me and afterwards g ave me the suggestion that I wouldn't remember. There was a room with a two-way window/mirror. Afte r awhile I knew there were others watching from the other side of the two-way mirror, since the doctor testin g and asking me questions would occasionally glance up at the window/mirror as if to communicate to those watchin g - \"see, I told you,\" or \"pay attention.\" They ask ed me lots of questions and at times I was displayed so other doc tors could see how I worked. I was seen as a high-l evel success since I was so split that I could be used in many d ifferent modes without conscious awareness. I had actually been directed to enroll in the study of psychology at Pepperdine University in Malibu. They were concerned that, if what I'd been privy to hearing there at the NPI lea ked into my conscious mind, they could have problem s. So they had me get my degree in psychology and study enough to make sense should my vast reservoir of psychiat ric knowledge and jargon leak into conscious awareness. They had to check me more often after my accidents in 1985 and 1987. During the time I was a student a t Pepperdine University, I was more accessible to the Malibu and Point Mugu areas, and so, available to Reagan at a moment's notice in the Malibu area when he was in C alifornia. Occasionally Dr. West would slip into an examining room when the younger doctor was examining me. He e xplained that there were some things he wanted to s ee for himself. He was arrogant with the young doctors and very authoritarian. I heard him make condescending remarks about psychiatrists and clinical psychologists as b eing beneath his level of expertise, since he was a n MD neuropsychiatrist. He thought my therapist in Westw ood, Stuart Perlman, Ph.D. was uninformed and easil y controlled in my therapy in 1988-91, since Stuart d idn't consider the biochemical aspects of my case. I reported to NPI on an irregular basis when I was told to report and I took Kelly there when instructed. As my func tioning level decreased when my early childhood memories began le aking back into my conscious mind, I was instructed to"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"report more often to UCLA-NPI. They knew the chemic al combinations to shut me down at night so that I couldn't access certain portions of my brain and memory duri ng dream state, which I had begun to do. That was why they had me take halcyon with a glass of wine every night during my term of therapy with Stuart. Whatever this chemical combination was, the nurse t old me to, \"take 1/2 or 1/4 of a halcyon tablet fol lowed immediately with a glass of wine, preferably white, and you'll notice immediate sleepiness and will fa ll into a very deep, peaceful sleep.\" Then a doctor came back into the room after the nurse left, and said, \"Repeat t he directions to me.\" So I did and he said, \"Exactly right. You're t o follow these directions every day in every way in order to feel better. You will not, I repeat, you will not jump o ff of any building. You will not harm yourself in a ny way. Do you understand my directions?\" Eyes closed and listening intently to his instructi ons from a deep trance state, I nodded yes. He said , \"Fine, you may go home now.\" And I got up, walked out of the hospi tal and all the way through the campus to my car th at I parked near the library. When I drove past the stop sign o n the freeway on-ramp it reminded me to \"tuck this experience into the deepest recesses of your mind,\" and I retu rned home. W hen the memory of events I was programmed to forget began flooding into my conscious awareness, I bega n responding by wanting to cut, burn myself or jump f rom the top of a high-rise building in Los Angeles . I just thought I must be really psychologically disturbed to want to do something like that. I simply could n ot fathom what was wrong with me and why these self-injurious comm ands continually caused me to feel like compulsivel y hurting or killing myself . And I had no way of knowing that my controllers w ere not actually ready for me to do myself in, at least not until my assignments with them were co mpleted. Mind Control Tune-ups There was a surgeon at UCLA who instructed me to drive to the hospital to have sex with him . He had dark hair, lightly dark skin, brown eyes and hairy arms . He was 6' tall, of good build and on the young si de. I was instructed to meet him at the doctors' cafeteria. Usually he had on his surgery greens or blues and we would have lu nch together. He was a vegetarian , and I watched him eat and later he had sex with m e in a small bathroom in the Neuropsychiatric Institute . The bathrooms in the NPI were unisex and he would open the door, wave his hand for me to pass inside, and then he would quickly slip i n behind me and whisper, \"shhh,\" so I wouldn't say anything. He switched the light off and began feeling me all ove r and he usually preferred entering me from behind. As programmed, I smiled and laughed and acted pleased no matter what. He liked for me to give him oral se x in his red sports car, but not when the top was down. For programming purposes, he jingled keys in front of my face and then he'd take me out and sometimes we walked in Westwoo d or went to lunch in a back booth at The Bratskell er restaurant. He had a good laugh when I told him abo ut my therapy with Stuart. He said, \"Dressed in lit tle shorts like that and looking innocent like you do, how do you t hink he can keep his mind on business?\" I laughed a nd told him Stuart didn't understand. Truth was, Stuart wasn't sexually addicted. This UCLA doctor took me to different rooms in the NPI for reconditioning and \"tune-ups,\" he called th em . One day he lifted me up on the examining table and I wa s giggling. He said they were taking real good care of me, keeping all my parts oiled and lubricated to keep m e in good working condition. There were large tube- like machines that they put me into. When they closed th e door, shutting me inside, it made a vacuum like s ound as it closed tightly and it kind of echoed inside. I lay on my back and there was a small square mirror, mou nted over my face. I think it was suppose to make normal, regula r customers feel safe or less claustrophobic. Although this doctor stayed with me during the horrible tests, he was ki nd to me most of the time . I didn't like the tests, but he told me what the doctors would do and when. One time two doctors used a scalpel and cut a small incision behind my right ear for something . I didn't know exactly what they were doing to me. They were always testing, probing and x- raying me. They must have a stack of records on me a mile high. They put me into a machine that was like a cylinder that spun me. I saw lights, and color; blues, pink s, yellow, white, coupled with sound and electroshock. I watch ed and recorded in my photographic memory as the do ctors in white coats mapped my forehead and face and attache d wires to me. At this event there was a whole room of people sitting still like zombies, all with our heads tota lly mapped out . Each mind-controlled individual has code numbers that follow them no matter what research projects w e were assigned to . They were studying our brains in all"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"different contexts, in all different environments, with different stimulation . They were also studying the genetic effects . They studied a wide and varied range of the effec t of environment and genes on a persons brain funct ion, their life function, their longevity, and their pro ductivity. They monitored brain function by reading EEG printouts taken from electrodes placed on my head, and regist ered and mapped lots of data that was inputted. Mind Control Technology of the Future There were lots of times they laid me on a gurney a nd injected me with drugs, and then the doctors tal ked to me while I was under the influence. There were many doctors at UCLA who knew all about mind control and were well-trained for the technology of the future . They were told they were specially selected becau se of their intellectual abilities \"to participate in an effort at world peace in the only method known to man.\" They were trained in the latest methods in how to program and operate under mind control . There were lots of doctors involved, different ones at different times in different plac es. I was \"demonstrated and modeled\" often over yea rs for their learning, understanding, and financial benefit. There were demonstrations for doctors, scientists, prison officials, and other professionals who were selected to receiv e this top-secret mind control information . Reagan was involved in this endeavor for years, ever since he was Gover nor and because he was cooperative and \"went along with the program.\" Then in later years, as President, the am ount of people who witnessed the demonstrations gre w as the plan for the New World Order grew closer to implementation . Those who were brought in to see the mind control technology could never go back to not knowing. They needed an army of professionals to carry out the p lan and the numbers of people involved increased dramatically i n the 80's after Reagan and Bush got into office an d cooperated to the fullest. During Reagan's administrations the doctors at UCLA did tests and demonstrations in front of other doc tors explaining how I worked, but they called this \"stud ies\" of the mind or brain. They didn't refer to any of it as mind control, but instead gave it the catchy name \" behavior modification .\" They had a circular arena where they conducted the demonstrations while I laid on a tabl e or sat in a chair naked, responding like a puppet to their cues. The demonstrations involved simple mind control tec hniques as well as telekinesis. Once the doctor directed me to bend a spoon across the room with the power of my m ind . They told me to see the spoon bend in my mind and t o focus solely on this thought to see it , and hear the words that played in my mind; then t he spoon would bend and sometimes it would even move and fall off a table f rom across the room. Once I was programmed to hold out my hand with a key in it and with my mind I bent the k ey. I curled it all up while I held my palm and fin gers still, my mind totally focused on the key. Most people have no idea the power a focused mind h as . The doctors watching would gasp. They also programmed me to start a fire from across the room with my mind . Large grants were given to doctors who wanted to do further research into the power of the mind or the mind/body connection, or studies of the brain. During one suc h demonstration, a group of doctors witnessed the p resenting doctor give me the hypnotic suggestion that I would not be burned. He held a lighted match to my arm, and just as he said, I didn't get burned. One particular doctor filed by at the end of the demonstration to get a closer look at my arm to see if, indeed, I was not burned. After viewing my unburned arm, tears welled in his eyes, and in Catholic fashion he performed the sign of the cross on himse lf and said, \"Forgive us,\" and walked away . Over the years, most scientists and doctors didn't respond as this sympathetic, compassionate, scienti fic human being did . I believe that many were uninformed as to the lev el of the mind control experiments and usages, and did not know exactly how the mind control was accomplis hed. But my controllers were well aware of these technologies and used them to have me appear as \"supernatural\" to people they wan ted to influence . They could pre-program in these manifestations and have them o ccur seemingly spontaneously without outside interf erence. This was how they rigged so-called miracles for the Pope and other Catholic leaders at the Vatican . They programmed in 'miracles' like making my hands bleed at the palms like Christ did or making me speak in high Latin tongue to the Pope or Bishops, delivering messages that dropped them to their knees, kissing their ros aries or necklaces or my feet. I didn't know what they were saying to me because I didn't really know Latin. Th ey, like many others, were open to these miracles delivered to th em on what they thought were the 'wings of angels' (me) to influence them. They thought I was some oracle delivering God's mes sages or angelic messages . I even delivered messages to Reagan with a religious theme , but it only worked on those who were religious.

I know beca use I was there a number of times when that happene d. They even talked at the White House after Reagan became President. One time, Reagan was sitting at his desk in the oval office when Kissinger escorted Nixon in. Kissinger greeted Reagan by saying, \"Mr. President, Dick is h ere to talk with you. He has some very useful information on fo reign policy that will help us.\" Then he added quie tly, \"Now I know as you do that no one is to know where this in formation came from, but I thought you should be in formed.\" \"Sure, have a seat Dick.\" Reagan said. Nixon smiled awkwardly as he held out his hand to Reagan. Initially, Reagan didn't seem too happy, as if he h ad some reservation, but appeared to quickly work t hrough his feelings, and gathering more acceptance, reached ou t and shook Nixon's hand. Nixon said, \"I have information on some key foreign poli cy that needs to be implemented before the year's e nd to insure smooth diplomatic relations with Russia and Saudi Arabia and a few other minor European Countri es.\" Standing there in his light brown suit, Nixon looke d pretty nervous. Kissinger said, \"This information may be key to unlocking br oader and deeper foreign relations, especially with the Soviets.\" Reagan leaned back in his chair and clasp ed his hands behind his head. Then, he closed his e yes. I could see what he did because Henry had placed me off to the side by the wall on a wooden bench, in my \"park ed\" mode, waiting for further direction. \" Russia will be an ally if we can provide the following .\" Kissinger said. \"Guns (munitions), corn and,\" Nixon added, followin g his comment with a laugh like this was absurd or something, \"they would like free surplus wheat and grain - wha tever we have in the stockades. We wouldn't have to go to any expense. These surpluses have already been subsidiz ed by our government, so there will be no further c ost to us. It's all just a layout on paper with no money exchange, just surpluses in exchange for information.\" \"What sort of information?\" Reagan asked. \" The sort of information that is held in top secret abeyance . It will have to be approved by the higher-ups .\" Nixon said, continuing, \" If we don't agree, there could be dire consequences for our country . The higher-ups said we have no idea the havoc that will be created if we don't comply with their requests . There's little to lose - just some excess surpluses.\" \"So you're saying I need to authorize the transfer of these surpluses?\" \"Yes, Sir,\" Kissinger said, \"t he others will take care of this information on their end. You nee d not be worried with the details, they will be tak en care of and if there are any loose ends, I will personally see to it that they are wrapped up.\" He handed Reagan a piece of paper to sign. \"We need your authorization for the shipments .\" Reagan put on his glasses, picked up a pen and sign ed the paper Kissinger set before him. \"Dick, I app reciate your help in this matter. Foreign policy always came so naturally for you and I appreciate your continued i nterest.\" He leaned back in his chair again."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":" \"Anything I can ever do to help.\" Nixon said, stand ing and offering his hand to Reagan again. Then he turned to Kissinger, shook his hand and left saying he would see himself out the side door. Henry sat down acros s from the President, leaned forward and with great seriousnes s, looked down at his folded hands, \"I don't have t o tell you how damaging this would be to the American public if it got out that Nixon was advising us on foreign poli cy.\" \"No, no of course not Henry. Look, I have a meeting at 10 w ith the White House Staff. I appreciate your help w ith this foreign policy. We all have our strengths and weakn esses.\" He smiled apologetically to Kissinger and r eached out to shake his hand good-bye. Henry stood up, shook Reagan's hand, completing the handshake by putting his other hand over the top o f their handshake. I don't know what that meant, if anythin g. Then Kissinger nodded to me and we walked out to a waiting black limo. Lots of times in DC I waited in the lim o for Henry while he went in and out of places. We were all over the place. Henry had keys to lots of offices. I don't know why , but he did . Lots of times I sat in on the meetings Kissinger had with Reagan and others, so I could re port back to the Council (in a debriefing) accurate ly, exactly what was said and done at different meetings. Arms Distribution - Guns for Drugs Some countries wouldn't take anything except guns i n exchange for their drugs . Reagan knew all about it-- Costa Rica, El Salvador, Jamaica, and other countries. Reagan cooperated with the Co uncil fully, doing everything they asked. He okayed American ships to meet with Soviet tanker s to exchange guns . Sometimes drugs were laundered through several foreign embassies so they couldn't be traced to their original source and then the American guns would be transferred to Russia, China, Japan , etc. The Council members were kingpins of drug coordination and money laundering down through specific American corporations in ord er to get political favors and laws enacted in their favor to keep their top companies. AT&T was one of them . The Council insured the financial success of thes e companies so they could continue using them as fron ts for their operations. The Council is at the top of the powerbrokers . Each President went along with them or they are kil led like JFK was My mind files were filled with information on guns, armories, and statistics on wh ere the guns were located and the inventory. Involv ed foreign dignitaries or leaders could access this informatio n in my mind files so they could know what was avai lable to trade, then they would send me back with a message regardi ng how much the gun supply could wield or buy in ex change for drugs. Then I would be debriefed by the Council and prepared with a return message for the foreign leaders. From what I witnessed, illicit drugs and gun runnin g backed much of the American economy . Reagan was not in any way unaware of the arms deals we made with foreign countries as he publicly port rayed. I know because the Council sent many arms trade messa ges through me to him and then he would give me the message and the Council would retrieve it through d ebriefing me. This was a message I gave him from th e Council: \"Mr. President, the Council sends their amicable me ssage to you. Arms will go to Iraq in exchange for hostages.\" Sometimes after I delivered the recited message, Re agan got really nervous and paced back and forth. B ut finally he would give his answer for me to take back to the Co uncil. Usually it was just a \"yes.\" Lots of times R eagan made the decision without Bush's knowledge. For some rea son I felt like Bush really knew what was going on. Reagan always seemed so uninformed, he never seemed to kno w what was happening and he made many decisions bli ndly without knowing the details. More on Guns and Drugs There were wooden boxes of munitions on a dock that were to be loaded onto a large ship. I was there t o make sure the load of \"sugar\" got on safely and that payment was made. The men accepting the shipment waited unt il the men in black police uniforms walked away and then they opened one of the boxes and lifted guns, rifles, an d hand grenades out of the packing. Packed on top were bag s of sugar to make it look like the whole shipment was sugar, but it was only a cover for what was really underne ath. This was a government operation - a highly camoufla ged, covered up government operation . A group of American officials were selling munition s to a nation we were at war with . It made the United States government lots of money . They didn't even care that the guns were being us ed to kill our own soldiers. Noriega was involved . It was a dangerous operation. The orders were tha t if there was any chance of being caught, the shipment was to be thro wn overboard. It was too risky to get caught. "},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"There was also a naval officer that was involved. H e was shaking hands with a man that I came with and they were talking privately out of my earshot so I couldn't h ear. The officer gave commands to one of the member s of the crew to unload the shipment onto the docks and then they rolled the cargo down the docks and stacked it on large carts. I climbed aboard the ship and we left immediately. Th ere was a window of time that was opened to get in and out to complete the deal. It began at 0800. So we left por t immediately and were quickly underway. There were some kind of devices on board that rendered our ship untracka ble at sea, so that they could not be detected. Thi s way no one would even know that the United States ship had bee n to the port. Sometimes the big naval or other kin ds of ships would unload their cargoes onto smaller ships that would then go into the port to deliver the goods. Our government had very dirty operations. I was sent to deliver messages, many of them in fo reign languages to whomever the delivery was going to. Another time I was used in a drug operation, I was delivered aboard a large Navy ship to an Admiral wh o was standing behind his desk giving directions to a lie utenant. The blue eyed, heavyset admiral was dresse d in a white uniform and hat with navy blue and gold trim. He ha d on black patent leather shoes and was very brutal . I think his name was Brimhall or something like that. I was ordered to give him oral sex and some of his ejaculate fell onto his shoe. For that he slapped me with the back of his hand so hard tha t I fell backwards . We were going out to sea and when we neared Mexico we went into port for \"supplies,\" which meant a dru g transaction. There were transactions in the Caribbe an, also usually aboard Navy ships. I was on board to service the Admiral and then complete a drug transaction. The N avy ships went the route and to destinations of a m ajor drug cartel. What looked like the defense of our nation or training of our troops was really drug transport ation that made lots of money for the U.S. The Presidents were usua lly well aware of this business. The revenue was justified as funding large projects deemed necessary for America n defense . It was all a vicious cycle of lies and manipulation s. I was sent ashore to meet \"the man with the parrot\" and was usually dressed appropriately for him to r ecognize me. They dressed me with a parrot shirt to match the pa rrot man I was meeting. The messages were always di fferent; sometimes I told the man to meet us with the stuff at 0800 at a certain latitude and longitude out at sea off this or that coast. Lots of the deals and the boarding of goods (drugs) took place out at sea . This way no one could detect illegal drug trafficking , as there was no one to monitor the transactions l ate at night, out in the middle of the ocean. Everyone in the government that held any position o f power was well aware of these drug transactions a nd their importance to our country's economy. In part, this is what keeps America head and should ers above the world economically . These ships went all over the world Mexico, Carib bean, Costa Rica, Haiti, Cancun, Cozumel, Cabo San Lucas, Panama, Brazil, even Germany and USSR. For years, I was used off and on to carry messages. They used lots of different slaves for these activi ties because, otherwise, someone could get familiar and be detect ed . I know because I overheard them talking about tha t type of security and how important it was for the Lieutenan t Colonel to widely vary the \"pigeons,\" used for me ssages. I was taken from my home late at night and boarded onto a ship, did my assignment, and was returned back hom e late at night. I was just phased back into bed with my husb and, as if I'd never left. I was kept at Point Mugu or other bases in isolation, and then debriefed before I was drive n home in a sedan to Agoura Hills. Sometimes I was helicoptered to Point Mugu, but always transported late at night . During the drug transports I was always assigned to top men on the ships with orders to please them in any way the y desired. Then I was usually taken into the Admira l's or Captain's private quarters. These rooms were nice, but small, and I was told to wait for further instr uctions or to have sex with him. There were portholes in the room and it was simple but very expensively done, as fa r as the materials: nice wood, brass and usually decorated i n red, white and blue. Sometimes after sex I would sleep in his bed with him until it was time for the transaction. Then he would wake me up and instruct me in what t o do, what to wear, what to say. Sometimes there were palm trees on the beaches where we dropped off a load of 'good s,' on a remote beach. It was always at a different time, di fferent location; so no one could detect or monitor what was occurring. Sometimes the coast guard in certain loc ations was involved but not on a regular basis. The y must have been individually involved. On many of these excursions, other factions would i nterrogate me in an attempt to find out information . They would use bright lights, exhaust me, yell ques tions, withhold food and pull my hair or take hold of my hair and smash my face into a desk in an attempt to gain information about my job , why I wouldn't talk, who I was working for, endless questions . But nothing would come of it, because they didn't know the keys and codes to access my mind file information, nor did I consciously know. "},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Some of the big deals I witnessed, involving more i nternational figures, took place in the Hawaiian Is lands, like on Maui. And the deals involving Mexico took place in Mexico, often in Mazatlan. While vacationing one ye ar on Maui with my husband, I was taken away from him by men in suits, put on a commercial airline by two Se cret Service agents and flown to a location like Jamaica or Costa Rica to deliver a message. I was given a clever disguise, dressed in a tourist costume - a fruit pa tterned skirt and blouse, with a big straw hat with fruit on top of it, and made to look like an overweight old lady. The p lace I was taken to was about an hour's drive from the airport by limo, and I was delivered through a dirty and poverty-stricke n town full of dark-skinned people, to a harbor sea port, then taken down to the docks to make the deal . This way the person I was meeting on the ship cou ld simply cut the deal and leave by ocean without ever needing to be on land. There were palm trees by the ocean and the coastline area was pretty much uninhabited toward the port. I t was a rocky seacoast in many areas with few sandy beaches. I was instructed to deliver the message only to the m an in the white uniform who took a hold of my left hand and elbow and asked me if I was lost. A man in a white Naval uniform and hat brought me on board the large ship, momentarily, to receive the message I delivered, \"S ir, the bird is flying north.\" Then he quickly shuf fled me off the boat and the Secret Service agents took me away by limo and I was flown back to Maui. I was kept in is olation, without food or water for a day, before I was retur ned by my husband's side at the pool where we were vacationing at the Hyatt Regency in Maui. Weaponry Technology of the Future While money was made during those days from the sal e of weapons, the Council said guns and munitions would be obsolete by the year 2000 . The frequency warfare technology they possess will make guns and munitions powerless because those wielding guns will have their brainwa ve frequencies altered by the new weaponry to such a degree that they won't be able to think to commit a violen t act . Society is being kept unaware of this until these self- appointed overseers of our world have completely st epped up the mind control within the populace. Then the people won't care about having obsolete weapons because th ey will be under the total lull and control of specifi c, targeted electromagnetic frequencies . Individuals won't be able to commit crimes agains t the populace. My controllers spoke about this as, \"creating peace on earth, contempora ry style.\" (For more information on this still classified tech nology read: Angels Don't Play This HAARP , Nick Begich Ph.D.) Kissinger Displays His Robot Technology Over the years, Henry had me programmed to deliver information regarding the mind control robot techno logy to different groups of men. These meetings took place my whole life. He or a spokesman introduced me and explained to the audience, which were usually small, pre-test ed groups, that I would deliver a very powerful mes sage. But, the most important message they were eventually to take away with them was that I was a human robot delive ring highly technical information and that this was to b e the technology of the future. While I was being introduced, I sat at the front ta ble looking straight ahead, waiting in \"park mode.\" Then I went to the front and initially explained, \"Due to the inhe rent leap in technology, what you are about to see and witness is very real. Along those lines it would be most appre ciated if you would hold all of your questions unti l the end and our moderator will be more than happy at that time to field any questions you might have. Thank you an d now we'll begin.\" Certainly, I was delivering this message verbatim, as preprogrammed and couldn't have thought on my ow n to answer any questions. And so I began, \"The history of controlling man is old. Could we ha ve the screen turned on please?\" I asked the man at the projector. \"As you can see, man was attempting to control his fellow man even in the cave man days. Actually this attempt for control goes back even further.\" "},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Meanwhile the moderator flipped to a slide showing androgynous man pulling a woman by the hair where h e wanted her to go. \"So,\" I continued, \"man's control of man is ancient . What is on the cutting edge of technology today i s what we choose to call, 'harnessing the mind.' Who among us wouldn't like to be able to have insta nt recall ? Or to be able to read and retain information or documents .\" At this point they flashed slides pertaining to wha tever career paths these men were involved in and I had documents pertaining to each field, e.g., legal doc uments for attorneys, medical reports for doctors, case histories for psychologists, account ledgers for bankers. \"Who wouldn't like to have at your fingertips all t he millions of minute details we find we need every day to function efficiently in our places of employment? G entlemen, you are not alone in your needs and desir es. Since I have not seen a single hand in the room rai sed, I take this to mean that you, too, could highly benefit from this new state-of-the-art technology in the fu ture of mankind's ability to think clearly, efficie ntly, and above all, with complete accuracy .\" \"Sound too good to be true? You will be pleasantly surprised to find that this technology is not only true, but you also could benefit from its use. Other corp orations, (or if it was a professional group, I'd m ention doctors, dentists, lawyers, etc.) around the countr y are at this time utilizing many facets of this st ate-of-the- art technology. The computer will one day soon be hardware of the p ast and the companies that have this new technology will be among those on the leading e dge . It will be impossible to compete with individuals or corporations who are currently adapting to our n ew modes of technology .\" \"Now, I'm sure you didn't get to your current level of success by using outdated modes of operation. W hy no, I'm sure each of you was among the first to own the latest in computer technology. That is what se ts you apart from business people (doctors, lawyers, CEO's , etc.) who did not have the foresight that you had to opt for the latest technology has to offer.\" After listening to this whole spiel, they were taken to their first demo , and afterwards they were asked to fill out a brief questionnaire . They were asked to fill it out in order to insure t he perfection of future presentations . The questions were slanted toward gathering data on each participant's attitude, open ness, etc . They were also told they had the right to remain anonymous ; however, they were told there was no risk due to the fact that no one else would have access to these questionnaires. As a final not e, I said, \"And to thank you, we will be sending every person who takes the time to fill out this questionnaire a very special booklet we've been privy to call, \" How To Insure Success in Business: Without Burnout .\" So gentlemen, please loosen your ties, sit back, relax and enjoy the final portion of today's presentatio n. At which time, they were shown some more slides and given a little more information. After 12 such sessions, if their returned questionnaires kept indicating they were \"remaining on track,\" they were introduced to the higher level of being let in on the secret . Then they were told that I was \"a robot \" and they too could own one , at very little cost to them . At that point they were asked to, \"just sign here for more information and one of our representative s will be glad to further assist you.\" These demonstrations took place all over the world, for all different professions, including the scien tific research and medical communities. Even as a child of eight, Henry said I demoed so well and had such an enormou s impact on audiences that they would have their mouths gapi ng open, and Henry was so proud of himself. By the time I was eighteen, I had spoken to groups all over the world . Over time I went to \"mini-conventions\" for people w ho owned slaves, where slave tips, slave toys, slav e trades, etc. were exchanged amongst this certain group of men . \" Men in the know\" is how they referred to themselves , who met to share their latest information. I was there to h and out brochures before I was demonstrated. People loved the continual line of programmed jokes that I spewed ou t and thought it was hilarious that I was handing o ut my own brochure, miming like 'a perfect robot.' At times both men and women were in attendance . There was some other business I was promoting, initially – not mind-cont rolled slaves - but that was what really was being promoted"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"under cover at these meetings. Certain pre-selected men were given large wooden, g olden keys, each displaying a phrase or word to unlock me . These individuals were allowed to unlock and use me for the evening at pre-specified times . It was explained to these so-called gentlemen that these \"keys\" only worked for this one night . It was further explained that due to the kaleidoscopic programming effect, that the keys would revolve a band on the outside of my skull and would stop in just the right place so the eyes of the personality specifically keyed woul d lock in each and every time. I think those men who were given keys were the only ones allowed to know the true nature of my mind control programming . They must have been interested in purchasing \"their own .\" But publicly acceptable business also took place at these events parallel t o this subterranean line of business, so that money was made from all angles. In later years, Kissinger used the movie Working Gi rl as a scramble in an attempt to keep these memori es from being clear to me. It was not only used for me but for lots of other corporate robots like me.

On April 12, 1987, at 9:15 a.m. I had another acciden t. I couldn't fathom how or why I could have another acc ident at the same precise date and time, two years later . But, after smashing my head into a tree and breaking my back in a horseback accident I began flooding with more memories of the past and began having even more tro uble functioning in my day to day world of responsi bilities . I was forced to take more time out to rest and heal i n my conscious life. I sought more chiropractic car e and began deep healing with prayer, herbs, and increased body therapies. During this time of physical healing I also grew spiritually closer to God and gained the strength o f perspective I would need to face further reality . A Visit to the Mental Hospital It took a couple of years but as my programmed syst ems began breaking down, causing memories of my pas t to begin flooding uncontrollably into my present aware ness, I became increasingly more dysfunctional . I had trouble performing my daily duties as my past came crashing into my awareness, often with many memories floodi ng in at the same time. I had trouble dealing with my outer physical reality, because there was so much going o n inside my head to distract me. Paying attention simultaneousl y to both inner and outer realities was a challenge , especially with my programming throwing up hypnotic commands t o become confused, have a migraine, burn or kill my self, or redirect my thoughts in another direction my con trollers dictated. After numerous memories of abuse by my father, mother, brothers and others, including ways in which I myself was used within the system to ab use others, I asked my therapist, Stuart Perlman , to call Department of Human Services (DHS) with me and report all of us. He did as I asked and I gave lengthy interviews to authorities, hoping so meone would help me stop this abuse and insure that my children and the other children in t he family would be safe. As I became increasingly more dysfunctional, I was admitted to a mental hospital in Westwood for ten d ays and got another dose of reality. While in the mental hospit al, a suited man entered my room at night while I w as in my bed sleeping. He opened the door, came in, sat down on my bed, hypnotically commanded me, looked around to insure we were alone, then quickly put a tourniquet on my arm and injected me. Very quietly he said, "},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"\"You are safe, you are very, very, safe. Nothing yo u are remembering is real; it's all just a bad nigh tmare. Close down section 34 and remember you are safe, ve ry calm and very safe. You don't need to worry abou t anything anymore, everything's been handled.\" Addin g another vial of the drug to the syringe, he injec ted it into my arm and began round two, \"Stuart Perlman is your friend . He is your trusted friend helping you through these difficult times . He and he alone can help you, no one else can qui te fill his shoes and every time you look at his shoes when he is sitting in fr ont of you, you will remember this. Now you will sleep very deeply and when you wake you will not remember any of this or the sound of my voice, but now you will sleep very, very deeply. Your children are saf e, you are safe and you will rest and sleep very de eply. Remember, you are very safe.\" When he was through, he took the needle out of my a rm, put all of his paraphernalia into a black docto r's bag, and quietly slipped out of the darkened room. As usual, I viewed all of this from other personalities with in, ones that were not asleep. What these programmers need to kno w is that when a person has multiple personalities, especially personalities that have been programmed to have sup erb memory capabilities, those personalities can an d do take note of everything that is occurring. If the presenting personality is drugged, there are still other personalities left inside, untouched by the drugs who 'take note' of w hat is happening . Due to this, myself and others have recovered volumes of experiences, as we healed and reintegrat ed, in order to be able to put together this larger picture to present to you . Their misuse of the technology failed. Sorry Henr y, back to the drawing board. I guess you need a further distilled diagram, because, Henry, your sec urity system was not locked up as tightly as you mi ght have thought. During my hospital stay, I brought up the issue of my children's abuse. To my utter disappointment, DHS failed to take seriously the allegations of abuse to the youn g members of our families . Further, as I was released from the hospital I leaned over the desk to see my medical c hart, which read, \"Delusional.\" No one took me seri ously then. I hope you the reader will now. Further Monitoring at UCLA My visits to UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute ( NPI) occurred more often after my 1985 and 1987 acc idents, and the ensuing head and back injuries. I waited in a r oom lined with chairs and, when called, I robotical ly walked where they told me to and did everything just like they requested. If they said, \"take off your blouse ,\" I did. Anything they asked of me, I did. They put me into an examining room, and tested me neurologically, sa ying things like, \"touch your nose, move your eyes up to the le ft,\" that sort of thing. Then they tested me walkin g, bending over, etc. I saw the white uniformed doctor refer to a li st in a little notebook. He asked me questions to w hich I replied robotically. He asked me, \"What is your name? Where do you live? Who is your husband?\" All these were standard neurological examination procedures. Then an older doctor came in and told me to follow him into a different room. Things got more technica l then. There was a room full of large recorders, the reel- to-reel type with a chair positioned next to them. He sat me down next to the equipment and gave me long round bars o f metal to hold in my hands. They were always testi ng different things. I didn't know what, but tried my best to do them \"right.\" If I did it wrong they got angry and then I got hurt. The doctor hooked me up to headphones and told me to hold the metal bars real tightly, and I was instructed to go into a very deep trance state. Aft er certain word phrases, I was electro shocked . I never knew when it was coming and was told not to let go of the met al bars. When the phrases didn't apply to me, like for instance, \"I'm an Eskimo\" there were no shocks. But after a t rue statement that was applicable to me, I was shoc ked. Some things felt very personal and could have only been applied to me. Like, \"I love my husband Craig.\" Or, \"I am a good mother,\" or, \"I am happy in my life; therapy is mak ing me a better person.\" All kinds of statements li ke that were played through the headphones. Sometimes they shock ed my feet instead of my hands or my head. Things v aried often and so did the people administering the 'test s.' At other times a white van picked me up from the st reets of Westwood, after a therapy session, and too k me to UCLA. Sometimes they did stuff to me right inside t he van. They had equipment inside and they said thi ngs to me and delivered electroshock. It happened often when I was in therapy with Stuart, in Westwood. The van would pull up to the curb and when the driver leaned toward th e passenger window with his arm across the seatback and looked at me, I was programmed to come toward the van and step inside. The driver's uniforms varied, like a m ail delivery"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"or some bogus repair service, and the man accompany ing him would do the work on me. Sometimes they would initially slap me around . I never knew what they were going to do, it was a lways different and I was caught off guard and couldn't protect myself. I couldn't ever think to protect myself, even if I knew it was comi ng. They caused all sorts of violence in order to keep me under con trol ; they tied me up in a chair and put a gun to my he ad, or raped or tortured me in some other way. They put knives t o my throat - anything they thought would scare me. At times there was a large mirror in the back of the van and they would stand me in front of it, tell me I was so and so, and give instructions to that part of me to do jobs or report things. There was a wide variety of electron ic equipment in the back of the van. They injected my arm with some drug and then showed me clips from a video. One ti me they showed me a clip of a person unscrewing a big round cap that let water into the room that they told me I was in. I was told it was real and that I would be safe if I didn't remember the past. In this virtual reality session they told me that the water would come over my head and I wou ld drown if I continued to remember. All this was d one in the name of \"national security.\" There was great person al confusion over being in charge of my body or its safety, as a result of all these tests. It was like my mind was removed from my body and acted separately, and it w as very scary because I wasn't able to be there to protect or hel p my own body, or my children's. When the men in the van were finished with me, they pulled. up next to my car, which was parked in Wes twood. When I saw my car I was programmed to switch to Sue and not remember anything that had just happened, but the other personalities were given the hypnotic suggest ion to remember to keep their instructions hidden a nd separate from Sue. The men told me to get inside of my car, sit there for awhile and drive home when I was read y. If I was running late they told me an excuse to deliver to m y family when I got home. This happened more often and the trauma got more intense while I was in daily therap y with Stuart and Margie. Another time at UCLA-NPI, I was sitting on a stainl ess steel table where they had been photographing m y brain from a x-ray machine that stopped and shot pictures in four separate places as it scanned my head. The doctor said my brain was in a perfect state for some sort of li nk up. Next they laid me on a stretcher and tied my ankles and wrists to the bars on the side then they slid me na ked into a long silver metal tube. They placed a sm all black mask over my eyes just before they shut the door. I thou ght maybe they were going to kill me but they said only parts of me died for others to be reborn. A continuous cycle of life and death for personalities kept things in order, preventing chaos from an overcrowded internal syste m. This was how my personality system was kept neat and clean, maintained for their use. The scientists and doctors turned everything into a study. They merely turned a mind control slave system breakdown or \"containment prob lem\" into another project to further their research . \"You have heard that it was said, 'an eye for an ey e and a tooth for a tooth.' But I say to you, do not resist one who is evil. But if any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also; and if any one would sue you and take your coat, le t him have your cloak as well; and if any one forces you to go one mile, go with h im two miles. Give to him who begs from you, and do not refuse hi m who would borrow from you. \"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love y our neighbor and hate your enemy.'

For if you love those who love you, what reward hav e you?\" -- Matthew 5:38 Chapter Thirty-three Bill Clinton and Hillary "},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":" Over the years Bill Clinton surfaced in higher level political circles. At one of Bob's parties Bill was all made up in a Statue of Liberty costume, decorated in red, whit e and blue, complete with blinking lights. He was h olding a torch and he acted feminine . I had to have sex with him later on and it felt con fusing to me because it was like having sex with a girl in a man's body . That was strange to me even under mind control, e ven compared with all the other strange and perverted experiences to which my contr ollers subjected me. In 1992, before he was inaugurated, Kelly and I were prostituted to Bill Clinton in Kla math Falls, Oregon . On the ride to meet him, we were told, \"Remember Chappaqui ddick - that same type of accident could befall you .\" When we met Clinton , he said, \" Did you know that I am now your boss, and you will do exactly as I say . You are under my command.\" With a robotical tone of voice he told me to give him oral sex and to get down on the floor where I belonged. Then Kelly robotically sexually s erviced him after which I gave him a message before we were let out of his room. Later on, I delivered messages to Clinton from the Council , from Kauai, before he was President. I was delivered aboard a very large ship , put into a stateroom and told to stay on the bed and wait for him. I did. He slipped into the room without knocking an d locked the door behind him. He said, smiling coyl y, \"I believe you have something for me?\" He had sex with me, wit h my dress and his pants still on. It was a quickie and then I gave him the message. It required a simple answer t hat I was to deliver back to the Council . His answer was agreeable. Bill liked to be sung to and have his forehead rubb ed. He liked to play mommy and baby baby Bill. He was often very strange . When it came to Bill Clinton , Henry would stoop low . He even sent up bags of cocaine with me to use when I was with Bill or Hillary in order to get them off guard. Bill and Hillary both did the cocaine . I placed it on a small mirror for them and they had glass nose straws they snorted it through. Bill could do the whole little white pile with one snort . Hillary took two or three sniffs to get all of hers . Then we usually had sex. When I said certain things, they thought I was a gift from Bob Hope , the entertainer. Bob and Henry's real relationshi p was kept quiet. The Clintons didn't seem to know that Henry and Bob were working so closely together, one getti ng me into the White House while the \"Expert\" Henry Kissinger delivered the goods in order to find ways to hang t he Clintons. Henry said, \"I want them so badly.\" After I was through, two men in black uniforms with yellow-braided stripes on their shoulders came to get me and one stood on each side as they escorted me back to the helicopter that was on one end of the ship. It was a white helicopter. They put me in with the pilot and I was flown back to the small airport on Maui, near the Coconut Inn, where I was staying, as I worked on the writing of my first book, Starshine. Before he was President, there was an occasion in a large hotel in Los Angeles. The Clintons were alre ady heavily guarded with a whole group of Secret Service agents . For my use as a sexual slave, I was trained to ma ke love to married couples by always bringing the focus back t o them. \"Isn't your wife beautiful! Isn't your husb and strong,\" or, whatever statements would strengthen their bond and love for each other, if they were to be kept t ogether. When I got through with couples they were totally enamou red with each other and hardly noticed when I dress ed and left the room. I was used in this way with the Clintons. There was usually cocaine, often a gift from someo ne they knew, routed through me. After the Clintons went to sleep I left. A man step ped toward me as I exited the room and escorted me down a red carpeted hall, to the elevator, and down to the lob by, as he held my elbow and lower forearm. At this point, another man took over, making a very smooth transition. I w as pushed down into a waiting limo (I think it was a black Mercedes), as the man hurried and slammed the door. I was taken to the airport and the driver radioed ahead, and a man met us at the curb and hurried me onto my plane . Now Clinton is President Kelly had a school function or a friend's party at the Beverly Hilton. I hadn't seen her in awhile as she was living in California and I was living on Kauai, but I was bro ught in to help her with \"The Prez,\" who was then newly-elected Bill Clinton . He had a group of girls and women there and that ni ght he wanted only oral sex , along with chocolate and fruit slices. Afterwards, it was my job to redi rect the girls back into their social function so t here would be no"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"mix-ups. Sex slaves were used to sexually service both male and female members of the White House when our controllers called for it , and I was not to be exempt. Once when I was flown to the White House from Hawaii, Hillary played what she called \"the tease game .\" She tied me up so she could be safe, she said. W hen she was through with me she looked at her gold watch, said she had to go, put on her dress and left. I put on my clothes and headed out to the waiting limo to Henry. Henry always wanted to know exactly what Hillary's verbal responses were to things I said to her and h e listened very carefully for speech patterning. They were try ing to create a phrase of words that would stop her dead in her tracks when she went to court for the Whitewater incident . They had been planning this one even before Clinton took office . Henry knew and so did his people . They were trying to destabilize the government by ousting the President. Their plan was that \" A cornerstone will fall, and further destabilize th e American people . First Nixon, now Clinton, thus the people will lose faith in their leaders and the dem ocratic way of life . So they will want to change it and will lean toward World Order .\" I knew in 1993, long before the Monica Lewinsky affair , that if Clinton was ousted, they had succeeded ag ain in their plan and movement toward the New World Order . The programs I had for the White House were pretty well-worn and grooved. Henry often rode with me in the limo to the White House if he hadn't had time to load me up beforehand. Sometimes, he wanted to sharpen me up or check my systems. He often went to have a cup of co ffee or a cigar while I was doing the job. When I c ame out of the White House, flanked by Secret Service agents, I'd get into the limo and he would ask me to repeat verbatim what was said. I'd tell him exactly what they said and how they enunciated it. I could record not only what they said, but I could repeat it back just like they said it - tone, inflection, and all. And from that, Henry an d his boys could run a voice print; then, using it, they developed a way to control people through their own language patte rns. Henry put his cigar to his mouth before saying, \" If you can get their patterns, you can control thei r minds .\" They put me close to the Clintons so they could obtain speec h patterns, information about weaknesses they had a nd ammunition to get Clinton thrown out of office. They would stop at nothing in their effort to chip away at the Constitution and democracy . Henry Kissinger hated Bill Clinton , but he especially hated Hillary . He wanted to publicly humiliate and disgrace her by showing that she had illegal investments and that she lied . Henry said, \"People (the public) will be manageable after this is exposed.\" Al Gore was easy for the Council because I believe he is a robot like me . Al Gore had me perform oral sex on him. He didn't do cocaine, though. He adamantly refused. Henry said, \" He's a robot of choice .\" I also had memories of experiences where I was at the White House with Hillary, Chelsea and a famous female vocalist, involved in a sex ritual. My personal belief, based on my experiences, is tha t over the years, more leaders were under mind control . I believe it to be vitally important to dismantle the system that has created this, as well as gain aid for the victims, but not to further punish or humiliate the victims who are in need of profes sional help to heal. I know there has been corruption at the highe st levels in the White House, and whether compromis ed through blackmail, lack of spiritual integrity, or mind con trol, I believe the Clintons are caught in a \" Catch-22.\" In a society where mind control is insidious, the w hole of society is responsible in some way, whether through ignorance, denial, spiritual disintegration or gree d. To the extent that some of us are not free, none of us are free . I believe it is God's perfect plan for those able per sons to come to the aid of those who are in need. In the center of the flame there is a hollow place and nothing can burn in this sheltered space. For the fire builds a wall, scientific fact claims, and insures a safe area in the midst of the flames . And in the hurricane's fury there's a center of pea ce where the winds of destruction suddenly cease. And this same truth prevails in life's tribulations ; there's an island of calm in the soul's meditations . A place that is quiet where we're shielded from har ms secure in the haven of a kind Father's arms, where the hot flames of anger have no power to sear and the high winds of hatred and violence and fear lose all the wrath and their savage course is softly subdued as faith weakens force."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":" So when the fires of life burn deep in your heart a nd the winds of destruction seem to tear you apart remember God loves you and wants to protect you.

In an attempt to understand what was wrong with m e, I began reading every technical book I could get my hands regarding Multi ple Personality Disorder. In the 80's, there wasn't much written. As I read I recognized symptom similarities but did n't seem to fit the mold of the 'garden variety' ve rsion of MPD, caused by abuse without programming. My search for the truth was unceasing. Desert Hot Springs Between 1985 and 1990 my husband and I often went t o Two Bunch Palms, a spa resort in Desert Hot Sprin gs, which is a neighboring desert city bordering Palm S prings. Craig and I would go for a few days to rest in the mineral pools and utilize the luxurious massage the rapy and green clay facemasks that were a part of t he resort's celebrity reputation. Once before I went, I watched a King Arthur video and when a shaft of white ligh t shown down on the oracle as he kneeled to deliver a messa ge from God to the king, I began crying and knew at once I needed to go to Two Bunch, alone. Witnessing this, my husband said, \"Fine, it's okay. Just go. Do what you need to, honey.\" I left immediately. Arriving at Two Bunch i n the dark around 10 o'clock at night, I was terrib ly afraid, but didn't know why. \"Two Bunch\" as we referred to it, was a 'double edg e sword' where I was accessed by Bob Hope and a gro up of men, including the Council. At the same time I was receiving intense bodywork from professional practi tioners, which helped shake loose memories at a cellular lev el, other dedicated parts of my personality structure who wer e skilled to withstand torture and humiliation contin ued to do so on an increased level so that I could continue therapy and healing . I prayed daily for the Holy Spirit to bring to mi nd those things that needed healing in the perfect time frame, and that is just what occurred. These personalities cooperated over the years of my battle for freedom by absorbing the threats and abuse and, in addition, k ept it separate from my conscious mind so I could continue my quest for freedom, unencumbered by fear or resistan ce. After an intense session with a gentle little old m an who was an expert in Trager bodywork , my memories began to increase. During the same visit, I was instructe d to attend secret meetings at Two Bunch where I st ood back while a group of men talked. My husband was seldom there. I believe one meeting was \"The Palm Springs Civic Committee.\" Bob golfed with them and they had busin ess dealings together. There were times I was picke d up in the parking lot by a silver limo and taken to Bob. Sometimes I wouldn't even get out of the limo; I'd wait for Bob and he would enter to direct me. Other times I woul d spend the day with him. One night I was directed to a bunch of palm trees late at night to look for the White Owl. Bob Hope ended up being the White Owl I was lookin g for. At the time, I was unaware that this was a program. I walked outside into the late night breezes to repor t to the Palm Trees and to Bob, the White Owl. Late on another night at Two Bunch, in a nightmaris h reminiscence of the movie, Stepford Wives, that I had been required to watch years before, I robotically respo nded to programming as I trekked out to the parking lot in the white robe provided by the spa. A limo pulled up an d mindlessly I climbed inside where a man immediate ly injected me with a drug. When we arrived at a big w arehouse-type building in the desert that was like a robot"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"reconditioning facility, the man had to help me out of the limo because I was so drugged. Once inside, doctors in surgical greens placed me on a gurney and started a n IV. It may have been filled with a truth serum drug , because that is the type of questions they fielded me. They were trying to identify what I was doing in th erapy , what I was remembering . Repositioning me to a chair, they slapped me over and over and I wasn't allowed to go to sleep. If I began to fall asleep, they slapped me again. They were very upset about the therapy and told me lots of lies while they made me look into bright white lights. If I di dn't keep my eyes open long enough, they would hold my eyes open and face me directly into the bright lights. They kept injecting my arm, as they yelled at me . A man, approximately 35 years old, dark-skinned with brown hair , wearing a green tie, tan tweed jacket, white shir t and tan pants, entered the room. He directed the doctors what to do and told them wh at he wanted to find out , then they supplied the drugs, electroshock and lights . Returned to a metal gurney, he asked me questions over and over that didn't make sense to me, while I sat on the ed ge of the gurney with my head hanging down, totally out of it. He showed me pictures of people, men usually, and aske d me questions about them and kept slapping me. Parts of my personality system would not comply and talk to him and it was making him very angry . In response, he took something sharp to the bottom of my feet. Then he c alled in the bright lights, and when my eyes could no longer stay open as he commanded, he had another man hold my head up, prop my eyes open and direct the lights in my eyes. They kept this up for what felt like forever. Then he laid me down and put a long rod up my vagi na to shock me as he said, \" She'll talk, just give her time - we have all the t ime in the world .\" But I was dissociated deep within myself and really didn't care if they killed me or not. I had been c onditioned from birth to take what they dished out and if I died, I just wouldn't have to endure any more. No more suf fering, it would be over. His frustration level saturated, this man instructed his assistants to lay me down and they t ook an electric sheer, the type you use to clip a dog, or prep a pe rson for surgery and ran it up my pubic hair, up my stomach, all the way up to my chin. He said it was something to remember him by, \"To keep remembering what happens if you don't comply.\" After I'd given up and was \"gone\" they pulled a pla stic cap dotted with little metal electrodes over m y head. They told me over and over that they would make it much easier on me if I would just cooperate and quit the rapy . But I didn't stop. They had to carry me out to the limo a nd when we arrived back at Two Bunch, the man accom panying me snapped his fingers in my ear and commanded, \"Sn ap out of it!\" and followed up with the suggestion that I was very, very tired and wanted a nap. Slowly, I trudge d back to the room and went to sleep. I don't know where Craig was. Desert Hot Springs was a place of horror for me as I attempted to get well by working hard in therapy with Stuart and Margie . I remember Stuart saying to me after I continued to show up day after day with more pieces of my painful past to process in therapy, \" I have never seen anyone who is more motivated than you; it's like you're running a marathon .\" I responded, \"I don't feel like I'm doing this fast enough.\" No wonder - neither he nor I consciously knew that I was still being tortured and reprogrammed; reporting to the Federal Building, to UCLA, to my political abu sers and to Bob Hope when assigned. Consciously, I thought Two Bunch Palms was a place where I went to get rejuven ated to do more abreactive work in order to recover. But ev en in the midst of the chaos there was a divine pla n and timing to my life; I just had to be extremely patient. As my healing defiance continued, I was returned to Tw o Bunch. One night I got dressed to go eat in the restaurant. Th ere was a very large clock that hung over the entra nce of the restaurant and my instructions were to, \"walk to th e clock at 6 o'clock.\" But instead of going inside, I was instructed to turn and walk to the parking lot where a man in a white suit drove me by limo late at night to a cl ub. He took me inside and seated me in a maroon colored booth tuck ed away in the darkened club. Sonny Bono came out a nd told me to enter the cleared area. He was twirling a whi p like he was going to lasso something. Then he cra cked the whip. He did it over and over and it terrified me, because I felt he was going to hit me with it. Sonny said there was nobody there to hear my screams. \" Scream all you like ,\" he said laughing. Jokingly he added, \"I kinda li ke it.\" He went on to explain that he was \" giving me what I deserved for trying to break the m old .\" I was helped up off the floor where I was huddled a nd delivered to a group of men in suits. They said I was the guest of honor, but it wasn't fun. They said I was stirring up a bit of trouble back there in Southern California and they just wanted to make sure that nothing bad happ ened to me. They took a long time to tell me all th is, slowly, calmly and smoothly, before another man took me to a dressing room type of partition in a back room an d, holding"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"me up by one arm, threw me up against the wall and beat the living br eath out of me . I ended up in a heap on the floor with my mouth bleeding. Giving me one final k ick with his pointed boot, he said, \"There, that ou ght to do ya.\" Another suited man came in and began \"taking care o f me,\" he said, while he took pictures of me all be at up to send to my family and friends, and he told me over and o ver, things that didn't make sense to me like, \"You are a queen. You will always be a queen; you have no successor s o you must always remain the queen. It's a matter o f privilege; you must remain the queen.\" His last instruction wa s, \"Lay by the pool and get a tan,\" that I was goin g to be visited by \"the man.\" I knew the man he spoke of was Bob Ho pe. After I was returned and spent the next day rec uperating and tanning by the pool, I was picked up again. On the way to see Bob they said my clothes weren't sui table to see him so they stopped at a dress shop in the Springs and one of the suits went in with me and picked out white slacks, a yellow shirt, a gold belt and sandals. Throwing m y clothes in the trash he said, \"these are more bef itting.\" We met Bob in a public place. I was taken to him and he br oke free for a moment and came over to me, \"Tsk, ts k, is this anyway for a woman to be showing a good example to her offspring?\" He was referring to my attempts at freedom. To further frighten and intimidate me, he pulled a picture out of his coat pocket of Kelly and I naked together and said, \"The time will come my fairy princess to spea k of better things,\" and he continued, finally comm enting that he needed to, \"teach me appreciation.\" Roughly, he too k hold and squeezed my collar then abruptly let it go and walked away, like he was through with me. Unfortuna tely, he wasn't. I was taken back to Two Bunch wher e I left the new clothes in a massage room and returned to m y room with another white robe on. Another occasion Craig was with me at Two Bunch, wh en late at night a limo picked us up in the parking lot. We were taken some place and reprimanded for the thera py I was doing and were threatened with the \"loss o f many things,\" if I didn't stop and if my husband didn't make me stop. A man in the limo took hold of Craig by the shirt and warned, \"Bob doesn't want to have anything happ en to his important asset. Do you understand?\" \"Yes , sir,\" my husband replied. He was very scared and for some reason I started laughing . Within seconds the man delivered a blow to my face. I felt the stinging of my cheek as his attention turned to me, \"Do you find something funny, young lady?\" I became very serious and stopped laughing. I didn't have any way to know then the uphill battl e I faced, the magnitude of the system I was attempting to break o ut of, or the many obstacles, heartaches and abuses I would have to withstand over time in my battle for freedo m. Despite the threats, my husband continued to pay $3 ,000- $5,000 a month for psychotherapy and bodywork, for four more years of my recovery . My controllers found the fact that I was in therapy amusing, totally assured that I was processing fro m anywhere but the National Security guaranteed, mind-controlled a rea of my brain. Since they saw me as a robot, they didn't worry about being discovered . Plus, they felt their secrets were protected by t heir sheer incredulity. I was programmed to report to the Federal Building, which was in very close proximity to Stuart's offi ce and to UCLA. I went upstairs to the 7th floor, exited the elevator and went down two doors on my left. I was told, \"You will find a room with a view,\" which cryptically me ant there was a closed circuit television for instr uctions. Further I was told, \"Sit down, soak up the view, then go ba ck downstairs and try to read the newspaper in the stand and report back if you can.\" Due to programming against it, I couldn't read it but always followed orders and tried. I was at the Federal Building often. It was a place of \"o rders headquarters\" from Henry. He gave me instruct ions over closed circuit television when he couldn't gain acc ess or time with me anywhere else. I had a lot of disguises to wear into the Federal B uilding. Hats, dark glasses, old baggy dresses, or skirts I'd throw on over my short shorts. I received closed circuit instructions at other locations also, like in rooms in hotels or at corporate offices, office buildings in Los Angeles, Santa Monica, or in the San Fernando Valley. But, at times, Henry had something urgent and needed access to me immediately, so he sent me to the Federal Building. I also delivered my own medical reports from UCLA to the F ederal Building to send back to Henry. I guess it w as like a mind control report card. My continual breakdown cr eated more need for \"check-ups.\" Hope Tries to Bring Me Back Into the Fold During this time as my memory began bleeding throug h, per program, I suffered with severe migraine hea daches and other programmed responses to this security bre ech. In another of a series of containment efforts, Bob directed me to hike up to China Flats, a small waterhole are a located on the Jordan Ranch, down the street from my home."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"He told me to meet him there at 4 p.m. Bob was flow n in on a two-seater helicopter. This meeting was i ntended to bring me back in line and was not much different fr om the little chats he and others had been giving m e. Like always he started out very calmly and before he was through ended up shouting at me as he paced all ov er. He always said a lot of, \"When are you ever going to l earn?\" in between the programs he triggered me with and he called me, \"my child.\" What he and others didn't un derstand was that I was not any more capable of rea lly controlling of myself and my actions than I had eve r been. The actual problem was that now I had parts of me who were becoming conscious, which was triggering the a cting out of their program commands and this was di srupting my usage and threatened to destroy their plan for m y life. In my soul I wanted to be free, but it woul d take time to accomplish that. Robot Breakdown Strategies One day, Henry and George Bush were having a \"meeting of the minds,\" as they calle d it, to decide what to do with me since the efforts to keep me 'in line' and 'on line' were continually failing . As I sat in 'park mode,' overhearing their conversation, George Bush said, \" We're going to have to waste her Hank .\" Henry replied, \"George, we have to be rational and calmly think ah ead to the future. Just look at the situation we ar e faced with. This isn't one isolated case . Sure, she has been my closest watched, but if she 's breaking down after all we've done, then the others can do the same thing. We could have a world of trouble on our hands and I don't mean that lightly. We have got to restore her and send her back out there. We'll need a hundred of them like her to help keep the others marching in l ine . We'll just create a new scenario. It's our game, we can create it anyway we choose, like we always have . I just need some time to figure out a plan. Take her out now and we actually will lose control . We can use her to learn from our mistakes to correc t them next time . I'm sure I can devise a plan that will capitalize on this. I just need time to go back to the think tank .\" As I continued to break down even further, I overhe ard Henry Kissinger say to a man I didn't know, \"We may as well monitor her closely and watch how s he breaks down . We've got a lot of others like her out there that are going to need tending to . So we'll learn from her how to best take care of th e others .\" Through my therapy with Stuart, Henry was hoping to seal up the holes in my consciousness that were leaking memory of my past, especially the over the rainbow parts of my life experience that I was programmed n ot to remember. They were attempting to do a repair in my mind from my childhood so it would shore me up for further use. They also wanted to set me up to keep others l ocked into programming, while they listened to me lecture on how I got out , which I wouldn't really have accomplished. After the culmination of their plan, they felt they would have the masses' minds under c ontrol and would no longer need to continue the charade since no one would be able to think to question anything that was occurri ng . They felt this would greatly simplify the human condition so that those self-chosen elite who were qualified could ex ist in peace and have superb quality of life. Henry said he had been witnessing too many robots crackin g up and he needed me to be restored so I could complete the business that was planned for me with the contacts that, over the years, had grown to know and love me. He said I had put in the time and had gained an intimate trust w ith many important key players and I had to finish out my ti me by continuing to be of service to the people tha t had grown accustomed to me. So they shored me up with therapy , submerged me in the new age healing program lock-ins and began getting me conditioned to not be with my husb and so much. Craig and I had been inseparable for m any, many years, so this was a slow but steady change. Henry had me peruse the leading bookstores, buy a variety of new age books from different categories , read them and report back a synopsis. This gave him plenty of current 'rages,' he called them and data that he could tap into to devise a strategic plan for the future . And Henry's plan soon emerged. One day after my the rapy session, men in suits accessed me in Westwood as I went down the st airs that faced the back parking lot and confiscate d my whole journal. Skimming through it, one said, \" She's written out a whole agenda .\" They told me I didn't need to worry about this anymore, that they would be glad to hand le it for me. And they walked away with my journal. Then I had to report for more reconditioning in their attempt to shut down the leaks. This was in the late 80's. Henry felt it was crucial to monitor me heavily until I'd made the tr ansition fully into the new 'persona' they were cre ating me to be:"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"increasingly a more independent woman, very togethe r, good speaker, writer, etc., for the future . In this way I could serve as an attraction and ultimately a containment person, with an agenda of speaking ou t about satanic ritual abuse . Then others would miss the real story about the min d control while their own programming would be sealed even tighter by words they would program me to deli ver. \"Like one of those Chinese finger puzzles,\" He nry said referring to the containment web. This was all done so when they transferred me to Hawaii, the transit ion would go smoothly. Was it Escape or Relocation and Redirection? After I fled California to Kauai, what I was still not yet aware of was that as parts of me celebrated their freedom, other programmed parts were still intact, fully pro grammed and still serving \"the cause\" my controller s dictated. Actually my \"flight to freedom\" was not yet fully r ealized; instead it turned out to be a clever plan my controllers devised in order to use me to the fullest during th e stepped up culmination years of their plan. They went about destroying my marriage and having me watch movies t hat superimposed the reality they wanted me to beli eve . I was directed to watch the movie Shirley Valentine and when I went to the Whole Life Expo, a psychic that I walked by reached out to me and told me that I woul d be making a trip across the oceans to a new life. My life was still out of my own control and unbeknownst to me I continued to serve their plan, only now from the t iny island of Kauai. A Heavenly Message Feeling lost, disoriented, and missing my family I left behind, I sought out places of solace on the i sland . One day I had an incredible experience . The white sand beach on Kauai felt warm beneath m y skin as I allowed my body to melt into the relaxation of the soft sand, basking in the warm gentle rays of the Hawaiian sun as the wind gently caressed my aching body and spirit. The sweet smell of the pungent plumeria flowers that I laid near m y head continued to waft a heavenly aroma. My body felt ex hilarated from the swim in the beautiful blue Hawai ian sea water. The uplifting Christian praise music that pl ayed through my Walkman lifted me ever higher, soot hing and easing the tension in my wounded, terrified, disori ented mind and body. As I rested, I once again hear d, very clearly, the words of the Holy Spirit , \" Doesn't one so wounded, deserve to heal in the most beautiful place in the world ?\" Tears of acknowledgement streamed down my cheeks and dropped onto my large magenta beach towel. Sil ently I cried out in desperation and despair, \"God, I miss my kids and my husband. I'm so confused, I feel los t and weak, what should I do? Help me Father, please help me.\" Soon I felt comfort as the Holy Spirit wrapped His huge loving, soothing arms around what I was to lat er discover was this most wounded of souls. I fell into a deep, peaceful slumber, momentarily l etting go of all of my cares and burdens and was entered into that peace that pa sses all understanding . And I began to realize the meaning of those words learned so long ago in Sunday school . This peace, enveloping me in the midst of the cha os and confusion of my life, gave the promise of hope. And this time it wasn't Bob. When I awoke from this pe aceful slumber, I was guided by the Holy Spirit to take a walk . Silently, I was led in the direction of an old sign that read, \"This is the site of an ancient Hawaiian refuge , a sanctuary for natives escaping unjust accusations and retaliation by their accusers where those seeki ng protection can find refuge .\" Tears came to my eyes as I realized 1, too, was bei ng allowed to take refuge there. And for the moment I felt safe. The Holy Spirit gently nudged me, like a loving fat her caring for his young, in the direction of the c rescent shaped rock wall bordering and enclosing into safety, the small swimming beach called Lydegate. I stopped to take in the incredible view, the turquoise blue waters, sending wave upon wave crashing into the large rock fortre ss that"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"protected the beach. I marveled at the glorious sen se I felt that the Almighty Creator of the heavens and the earth was gently rocking the world, thus creating the bea utifully graceful, never ending wave formations. Breaking my thought the Holy Spirit spoke again , calling me by the nickname He has used over the y ears, \"Starshine , look to the right of the large rock beside your foo t. There you will find a gift.\" Hardly believing my ears, I questioned, \"A gift for me from my Heavenly Father? Was I hearing correctl y?\" Curious now and with the anticipation of a small ch ild awaiting the opening of the first gift on Chris tmas, I bent to discover what sort of gift from God was there for m e to receive. Reaching out, my hand found it before my eyes, and I pulled the small object from it's home on the sand and held it before me, carefully examining ea ch and every detail. It was so tiny, so intricately detailed and so, so fragile. The paper thin shell remains of th e mini sea urchin was so extremely fragile that I was afraid I would crush it and break it simply by holding it. As I continued gazing on this miniature gift from G od, I listened with quiet intent as my Heavenly Father spoke to me once again , \" My child, you are so precious to me. I will hold yo u in the palm of My hand, just like you are holding this small gift from me . You need to know that as this shell is extremely fr agile, so are you at this time, in ways you have yet to understand . Do not fear, be patient with yourself and know that I am guiding you step by step. Most of all remember, you are never alone .\" Deeply touched by this message, yet completely with out understanding of the ways in which I might be a s fragile as the tiny, delicate shell that I held in my hand, I cautiously wrapped my fingers around it and went ba ck over to my place on the beach. Lying down, with the gift still carefully held in my hand, I contemplated, \"How co uld I be that fragile?\" As I thought, the only explanation I coul d come up with was how at times, due to the many st ill un- integrated multiple personality states I often foun d myself in, I was often unable to perform even the simplest of tasks. For instance one afternoon, alone at Kay's, so far away from my home in California, I found mys elf hungry yet unable to even think to remember how to go abou t making my lunch. Feeling two years old and indeed locked, for the moment, into a very childlike personality, I could not even begin to think how to make myself a sandwich. The perfected gears in my mind were not turning on their own, as the sophisticated machinery created by Henry Kissinger, Bob Hope and others, broke down and came to a screeching halt. And where it stopped, left m e often locked into the mindset of a two-year-old. I just c ouldn't function . And so I thought, perhaps this was the type of situation that my Heavenly Father was aware of and was reassuring me that He was there for me, all I h ad to do was trust. Broken and unable to do anything on my own, yet with the trust of a child, I allowed myself to relax into His promise. Later that night as I got ready for bed, I placed t he tiny, fragile shell on my windowsill, to remind me of the promise. And so it was that God led me to healing and complete r ecovery, in His time, and in His way, so that I could be with you to share His message today . For God wants all of the wounded, mind-controlled slaves to be freed and he has tasked me with the assignment of b eing the fiduciary, His trusted servant, willing to facilitate the release and healing of those wounded souls locked i nto the bondage of mind control. And so if you find yourself not free, God will make your way to freedom, and will l ead you every step of the way, just like He did for me. He has promised to make your way. Jesus said, \"Ask and it will be given to you ; seek and you will find ; knock and the door will be opened to you . For everyone who asks receives ; he who seeks finds ; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened .\" "},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":" All you have to do is ask. Interwoven into the many experiences I had where the Holy Spirit came to gu ide me, were also other experiences where the parts of me t hat were still programmed realized that I was still not free. Soon after I moved to Kauai, without my conscious a wareness, I was delivered to Barking Sands Missile Weapon Site, located on the south shore of the island, and at other times serviced people like Ronald Reagan, Bob Hope and his friends on the golf course in Princeville. Geor ge Bush met me at the tiny Princeville Airport in o rder to direct me into further assignments and threatened me in hi s attempt to keep my renegade freedom fighter perso nalities under wraps. In spite of my controllers' attempts to shut down c onscious access of how I had been used, I continued to have flashbacks of many of my political experien ces and I began to more fully understand the way my programming worked . These memories, that often included my family, ga ve me a fuller picture of reality and helped me understand why I couldn't yet safely retu rn to California. As I grieved the loss of my husba nd and children I had left behind in California, I was spiritually guided to thank God no matter how bad things looked . I found myself sobbing through my tears as I cried ou t, \"Thank you, God, I love it!\" even as they eventu ally took custody of my children away. The Holy Spirit continually showed me that no matte r how it looked, I was still in the right place . And while it appeared that I served two masters, all along God knew that I was still in service to a greater plan that I would need to experience and be a part of in order to chronicle it and share it wi th you now. Kauai Containment Center The friendly recovery network I was connected to wh ile on the island of Kauai was still carefully held within a network of programmed people so I would be surround ed by the programming themes intended to keep me in bondage. It is a very clever plan . I was welcomed with loving arms by Kay Snow Davis and Charles Davis . But mixed in with incredible love, healing, and Holy Sp irit insight, was also a secret agenda , one that to this day I believe they also were unconscious of . Charles drove me around the island to welcome me and orient me to my new surroundings. While we drove, he set in barrier blo cks within my mind that would later block memory of my use at different areas including large hotels, like the We stin, Hyatt, Princeville, CoCo Palms Resort, and Ga rden Isle Inn. The Westin Hotel on Kauai was full of big white statues, huge indoo r pools, waterfalls, and large cultural art pieces. Kay took Kelly and I there one evening, whe n Kelly was visiting, and as we walked around the h otel, she hypnotically laid in number systems from one to eig ht, designating different areas. Later when I recei ved the little post cards in the mail, alerting me to my assignmen ts, I could decipher the simple codes. All they nee ded to say was W- l and I knew that would mean the Westin, a room on the first floor. An eight would mean the far res taurant and so on. Each hotel had a letter assigned to it and n umbers identifying areas where I was to go. Not yet in touch with the many reporting personalit ies I had that were still intact, I thought I was s afe. Actually, I was contained by many things in my environment. Fir st I was contained by the network of programmed ind ividuals I was living amongst as their programmed statements and hand signals continually reinforced my 'rememb er to forget' programs. My memory was also blocked by the endless visual im ages that were linked in my subconscious mind with hypnotic program commands to forget. Many of these images in my daily environment were things like the large building-size murals of whales, dolphins and rainbows that I drove by every day. I was also still reporting back to California to old friends and other people who I didn't know were programmed. Then, I was repo rting to the 800 numbers I was instructed to. The containment plan was and is large, and will con tinue to work very effectively - until enough people are able to see what is actuall y happening . Still a Working Girl I was actually kept very busy on assignments, yet c onsciously thought that I went to the beach every d ay. There were blocks of assignments but I never was to enter a hotel from the same direction twice so I wouldn' t be detected or become a familiar face to the wrong people. Some places Kay cued me to and other places Charles did . But I was cued to large hotels all over Kauai and some of the neighboring islands. I was programmed to stand on the corner of the high way and was picked up by a military jeep and taken to Barking Sands Missile Range . There were underground facilities and if the base w as threatened, even for the security of classified, top secret information, then they had m issiles and bombs set to go off which later would b e explained as"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"an enemy attack . I don't believe the military guards knew exactly wh at they were protecting . When I'd round the corner with a senior officer-in-charge, they'd look surprised at first, but I was waved through before being taken to a high-tech operations room. Once inside they sat me in a large thick metal chair that spun and did all sorts of torturous things, but they told me my mind was numb ed so I couldn't feel the pain. They numbed my mind with hypnotic suggestion while my body spun. Then I was instructed to lean into position to look into the b ig goggles. The pictures I saw began with a bee and other natur e scenes and then it all went so fast I couldn't se e the individual pictures. That way the information went directly in to the subconscious mind without any conscious intr usion or filters to connect the two. As long as the programm ed information bypassed the conscious mind they fel t I couldn't remember because I wouldn't be able to connect the information. When I was to meet Reagan on the island, I received a post card in the mail and it had the date, time and place on it to meet Reagan. When he came alone I met him at the Princeville Airport. He arrived anonymously by hel icopter with Secret Service agents. A limo was waiting insi de the fence to the airport and the helicopter woul d land right by it and Reagan would be rushed off the helicopter, a nd hurried into the limo and we'd be taken to the P rinceville Hotel. Another time I was programmed to meet Reagan at the Princeville Hotel on the north shore of the island. He entered through the large sliding glass doorway and I was sitting in a chair in the lobby, instructed to watch for him. This was in 1991 and Reagan had come to the island for a visit. When he saw me he quickly pointed towa rd the left side of the hotel indicating that I was to walk tha t way. Immediately I walked in the direction he poi nted. As I got out of sight of people and into a back hallway he q uickly walked over to me, said hello and told me th at he missed me, then he spun me around for programming purposes and escorted me to the elevator. Men in suits foll owed close behind and he explained that he still had agents gu arding him that we would have to contend with. We entered into a large peach colored room that ove rlooked the bay. Reagan said Nancy was flying in to meet him later and said he just wanted a reminder of me. He went on to explain that he really missed me and he really missed being President. He said he was really surprised ju st how much he missed it. We had sex in the usual s tance, with him passively beneath me. Afterwards he smiled and said, \"You've still got it kid.\" He patted me and I lay next to him until he fell asleep and then I let myself out of the room. I passed the agents in the hallway hav ing a cigarette by the elevator and waited mindlessly for the valet to bring my rental car around. When I returned home, I was in a stupor and went straight to bed, all traces of the memory neatly locked beneath the programming that p rotected it. The Last Time I Saw Bob Hope Goodbye Cruel World Another day when I drove my Lexus to Princeville, I accompanied Reagan and Bob on the golf course. I r ode in the golf cart and was pretty out of it while we were on the green. All I could do was clap and smile when they did well and I kept score manually for them. While Reagan wa s taking his turn, Bob said to me, \" So you think you got away, huh? \" Shaking his head he continued, \" There are bigger fish in the sea that got away , but you my dear are not one of them .\" I smiled and curtsied to Bob, like I had done fo r years. Bob softened and said, \"Feels like old tim es out on the course, doesn't it?\" \"Yes it does, Bob.\" I answ ered just before he began to relive and rehash the past, constantly referring to old times, old movies he'd starred in, old performances, USO tours, old people - THE PAST ! He said he loved the Princeville course, loved the view and said that the ocean air was good for him. He had some sinus problems and said they cleared right up when he was out in the ocean air. He never once mentione d sex, maybe he'd become to old. They didn't bother playin g the whole green. Bob wasn't real strong and one t ime he fell into the golf cart and took a hold of it like he wa s having trouble seeing and walking. Reagan asked h im if he was okay and Bob replied, \"Hell yes, let's go on, I'll be fine.\" I didn't know then that this was to be the very last time I would see my owner in person . Prince Charles Visits the Island Prince Charles came to the island when he and Di were having marital problems . He came just to relax and get some perspective. The Council instilled a whole age nda into me for the week I entertained, toured, lis tened, and had sex with Prince Charles. Retrieving this memory mad e me really nauseated. "},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"My Children are Reprogrammed In an attempt to rescue my children and provide the m with a safe home and believing I was actually saf e and free, I brought them to the island. I had no idea that I wa s still being accessed, and that they were also. Co nsciously I thought we just went to the beach everyday, while t he kids played with friends and surfed. But later I remembered that when they arrived they also were taken to Bark ing Sands Missile Base. Their programs were stepped up to match my new level after which Danny was very sick and laid on his futon and cried for two days. While on Kauai, when Kelly was with me for the summ er we were programmed to perform as a mother-daught er sex team. We were also filmed in underwater ballet and sex with dolphins and other sea creatures in po rnography. Sometimes we swam with underwater sea turtles, they were such docile creatures and they weren't intere sted in sex. I could relate to them because all they tried to do was get to safety so they could relax and finally be at peace. There was lots of porn filmed on the island. They felt th e natural splendor would only enhance the productio ns and they filmed lots of slaves with dolphins. They filmed us in shimmery suits, or braid wraps, all sorts of fa ncy hair and body jewels and ornaments or jeweled waist belts wh ile otherwise naked. There was quite a following of dolphin porn lovers. When a male dolphin got excited, his p enis stuck up and looked like a Bird of Paradise fl ower. We all learned that if you weren't scared and approached h im lovingly the sexual encounter wouldn't be as pai nful. There was a rich local attorney named Ken whose job was to sufficiently launder the proceeds . I delivered money to him from Sylvester Stallone and from other less prominent men on the island. Sylvester Stallone Stallone liked to have group sex with lots of women and he l iked Kelly and I together . He had us the first time when we were staying in a cottage in Anahola. As pr ogrammed, during the middle of the night I went to my daughter and said, \"Kelly, Kelly, wake up, we have work to do. \"No Mom,\" Kelly said, \"I'm tired.\" \"Wake up now!\" I commanded, snapping my fingers dra wing my 13-year-old daughter into a wide-awake stat e. I held her hand all the way to the rental car we drov e when I first arrived onto the island. We drove to Stallone's house in Anini Beach and parked in the drive. He sa id that since it was a rental car it would be fine. Kelly and I went into the house and out to a oval room where th ere were other girls waiting. One was Japanese and another brunette . At first we all just sat and looked at each other , smiling in awkward embarrassment. Sly walked in w ith a white towel around his otherwise naked body and hel d his hands out to us. He told us we were waiting f or the 5th wheel but she never arrived. He laughed and directe d us into the bedroom. He pointed to Kelly and said , \"I want her first.\" He told her she had the Bo Derek look and h e kissed her before she began her trained, skillful sexual repertoire. Stallone was snorting cocaine and during the group sex it wa s my job to remember to offer him more . He had a small spoon that he stuck up his nose to s nort the white powder. Kissing Kelly he said, \"Bob has good taste.\" Pulling her hair back and kissing her more deeply he added, \"and it's getting better all the t ime.\" When he was finished sexually satisfying himself with her h e rolled her over and said, \"rest little baby,\" as he went to the other girls in turn. We never spent the night, stay ed just a few hours and after Stallone went to slee p I kissed his cheek, took Kelly's hand and we tip-toed out. Stallone once said, \" There's nothing quite like a slave . I love getting them from the underground . You're all so cooperative, don't give me no shit. This is the lif e I tell ya'. No bitchy, demanding women, not when I can have beautiful, sweet, white women who set me free. It's all about freedom ,\" he rambled, while laying on his back in a seemingly drugged stupor, about \" America the Beautiful and the home of the brave .\" He was high on cocaine . The higher he got the better the animal lover he wa s to become. That was his code name, \"Animal.\" And when they told me, \"the Animal\" wanted Kelly and 1, then I kn ew it was Stallone. I also gave him massages, often in open air areas. Sly thought the dolphin porn was the greates t new combo and he directed a lot of the porn videos .

I deli vered some money from Stallone and from other less prominent men on the island to Ken, the wealthy attorney who had a big beautiful house in Kilauea. I believe it was his job to see that the money was sufficiently laundered. "},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Sly wore a wet suit but we were always naked in the water. There were trained dolphins that we did wat er ballet and swam with. When we swam gracefully the male dolphin got excited and started nudging us. We grabbed ont o them and went for the ride; if we didn't, they told us, \"one wrong move and you could get ripped to shreds. \" The dolphin actually remembered us over time and the same male would consistently choose the same girl, even when the group size changed from small to large. They got to know us and didn't forget in between. When my sons were on the island they were filmed also. One day after the fil ming, Sly said to Kelly, \"You come back soon, ya he re?\" During other visits, where I was supposedly allowed to see my children, Kelly and I were prostituted to Charlton Heston , and I was to Kareem Abdul Jabaar . Taj Mahal , the jazz musician, was on the island to keep other slaves in line through satanic rituals . One time I was programmed to drive to Secret Beac h at night to attend a 'gathering' where, unbeknownst to my conscious personality, I w as raped in a ritual. Consciously I thought, as my programmed reality dic tated, that I had escaped from my controllers in Ca lifornia and I was now safe. I believed I had rescued my childre n, and as the summer came to an end, I began the pr ocess of enrolling them in island schools. I moved from hous e to house, attempting to keep our whereabouts anon ymous, only to have my still programmed children call back to their father in California and report our curre nt location and phone number. It was terrifying. And I thought I wo uld die of grief and terror when Craig told the kid s and I that if I didn't return them to California he would be sendin g in a police escort to bring them home. Devastated and panicked but not knowing what else to do, I returned my chil dren to their father in California. Shortly afterwa rds, my attorney notified me that if I wanted to ever see my childre n again I needed to attend a court hearing in Calif ornia. Frightened of the danger of being accessed, I calle d Ted Gunderson (retired FBI official) who helped me hire a bodyguard . I flew to California, where behind the judge's cl osed doors, I lost custody of my children. My attor ney, Doug Wolfe , let me in on the news when he informed me in the Courthouse hallway, \"You're lucky to be alive, just get back to the island and get a job.\" My children's programmed father and our controllers were now in even more total control of their lives . The Wind Beneath My Wings Extremely sad and depressed, I returned to the isla nd. The job I took when I returned was to begin to more fully document many of my memories and I began writing my first book STARSHINE . It wasn't an easy task because first I had to undo the endless programs that kept me from being able to use the word processor withou t a programmed part of me destroying the information I had just typed. But I was determined to do whatever it took to get eventual help for my children. Memories of a po litical and international nature often flooded my a wareness and I documented them each time something new came to m ind. Due to the vivid nature of flashbacks I experi enced, I spent nearly two years stuck in the body memory par t of my Kissinger experiences and had to live with the smell of this cigar smoke and listening within to the sound of his accented voice. Similarly, I flooded with se xual memories about Pete Wilson and Ted Kennedy. Talk about intru sion! Since I had no money, I hired the 'ocean' to be my therapist and with God's guiding , I actually did some of my best memory recovery work alone on the beach , with the ocean holding the space of peace, love and strength for me so I could delve to the depths of my own mind . With the solid foundation built from years of mem ory recovery done while I was still in California, and after a year o n the island retrieving still deeper layers of memo ries, and programming, I had a pretty clear picture that some thing was up – exactly what I wasn't sure. I couldn 't imagine why I would be with Henry Kissinger, Nixon or Reaga n, or what was so important about me that people we re following me and overly interested in what I was do ing. But all my memories, held together by the page s in my journals, began to neatly fill in the picture. In 1992, 1 purchased a light and sound machine of m y own , and after mastering the fear associated with using some of th e same technology my controllers had used on me , I began to more easily recover even deeper layers of memory . Soon I realized the programs that controlled me wer e broken and nullified as I became consciously aware of them . Bush Flies Into Princeville "},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"But my other secret jobs didn't stop and with my fa mily out of their way, I was now freer and more une ncumbered than ever to work for my controllers. George Bush m et me at Princeville Airport, a very small airport on the north shore of the small island. Then we would both be he licoptered to Barking Sands Missile Range. When we arrived he and a military officer saluted each other and then he was escorted to an outside structure that had gl ass doors. At another time, George Bush met me at Barking Sands Missile Range, for a talk about \"getting back in line.\" I was parked in my Lexus waiting near the entrance when B ush drove up in a military jeep. A military officer was driving him. Bush told me to start my engine and follow him . I followed through the gates that were opened for him into the missile site. He motioned me out of my car and stom ped over to me. He stood and yelled in my face about being irresponsible . I had a hard time hearing or understanding him be cause it was extremely windy. I also think personalities inside of me were attempting to shiel d me from his barrage of programmed verbiage. He wa ved his glasses around while he yelled at me. In his crypti c mind control lingo Bush said, \"Get into line or K elly will be on a #9.\" He was referring to the well known freedom t rain mind control theme, of being thrown off the tr ain, which cryptically meant her death. Angrily, Bush saluted and told me to get back in my car and get the hell home. He was very angry. An Act of Nature Sets Me One Step Closer to Freedom But \"category five\" Hurricane Iniki changed many of their plans and this act of nature ultimately worked in my favor, freeing me a little more each day . I lost the home that I attempted to recreate on t he island to the hurricane, and as I healed my mind, body and spirit, I realize d more and more every day that I still wasn't safe. In order to have the electricity to continue powering my laptop , Patrick Stone , the man who helped me write Starshine , (himself an unrecovered victim of mind control), and I were for ced to leave the island. Military planes evacuated us to the island of Maui, where we continued writing. There w e were continually visited and harassed by men my c ontrollers sent to the hotel that we later discovered was also a \"containment center.\" True to the network containment strategy, our frien ds on Kauai referred us to this place and we contin ued writing while we were monitored. It frightened me because I was now conscious enough to realize that I continually ended up in places where I thought I was free, but I wasn 't . This was due to the fact that I wasn't fully inte grated and half of my programming was still intact and affecting me , still binding me hopelessly to my controllers. In many ways I felt free though, and continued to heal and dedicat e my life to service and God. While I, Susan , wrote, my 'inner twin sister' Sharon took the heat and once again endured the physical and mental tortures so I could be free to write Starshine . My dissociative state was now being used in my fa vor, although it often wasn't easy. One night while in Maui, I had a dream and saw a ma p with a check mark identifying Oregon. At that tim e I was unaware that I was receiving telepathic messages, often at night . I called Margie Paul and told her about the dream and that I felt guided to move. So she talked to a famous movie star that was also her client and aske d her to recommend a place. Through that recommendation, I m oved off Maui and took what few belongings I had le ft with me to Ashland, Oregon. I rented a home, referred to me by this movie star's realtor friend, and began writing. Kelly and Danny visited me at Christmas. Soon after, Kelly and I were prostituted as a mothe r-daughter sex team to Clinton , who had just been elected, but not yet inaugurate d as President. I didn't realize that I was still programmed not to notice when I was 'missing time.' Healing, integra tion and deprogramming didn't come as quickly as I wanted it to. Healing took time. But my continued motivation to heal and figure out what this all meant kept me uncoveri ng more and more in regard to my own programming an d how the system all worked. Months later I mustered the courage to move back to California. I desperately w anted to help my children, and felt I was recovered enough and sa fe enough to do that. I didn't know I still had lay ers of personalities and programs still intact that would keep me under control, and unfortunately neither di d David Neswald, the therapist I worked with there in South ern California. To make matters worse, upon the completion of Starshine , as I readied it for print, my brother, Rick , who was one of my programmed controllers, and whom I had chosen not to see for years, was able to access me one la st time. This accessing allowed him to gain entrance to my a partment in Calabasas and rape me, threatening that if I didn't"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"stop with Starshine they would publicly display the compromising pictu res that he then took of my children and me. The next morning, I awoke disoriented, terrifie d, and confused and had no idea the source. But lat er that day, I \"remembered\" the horrific scene and was grateful to have at least remembered it because, in the past, it had taken me months, often years to remember traumatic events . In hysterical panic, I once again phoned Ted Gunderson for further advice on how to stay safe . He told me to get special locks for my doors, and a security system, and I had alarms that I bought for each door so if anyone, including myself, went in or out, they would sound off. I even purchased an alarm that I wore on my bo dy and set it off if anyone of a suspicious nature approached me. It was terrifying, as I realized I was still not a ble to keep myself safe, due to programming that operated beyond my co ntrol. Soon I realized, though, that this traumatic event was actually another \"gift\" to me, without which I woul d never have known I was still under program . I continued working in therapy with Dave Neswald wh o, although well intentioned, was not informed in r egard to how my sophisticated government programming worked. I had hired bodyguards in the past and now he and Ted were suggesting that for my safety I hire one again , only full-time now. With very limited funds, and enormous mounting therapy bills, I wondered how I could affo rd a bodyguard? I compromised and hired a live-in housekeeper who w ould at least be with me most of the time, as my th erapist was afraid that my controllers would switch me with my \"twin sister\" and take me away. I lived in absolute terror, trying to keep the trauma from occurring not only at my co ntroller's hands, but also at my own . I was scared all the time, because I couldn't even trust myself, not knowing i f I would involuntarily switch and put myself or my children in danger. Most of the time, in those days during 1993 , 1 couldn't even complete a sentence when I attemp ted to communicate and my mind felt confused and exhausted . I persevered toward getting Starshine into print. When I began to ponder just what the c over should be like, I found a booklet in a craft store with a picture of an ang el that I just knew had to be on the cover. The events that occurred later that day, proved to me without a shadow of a doubt that God's angels were indeed watching over m e . When I called the artist and explained that I wanted her angel to grace the cover of Starshine , she agreed without question . The only thing she wanted me to know was that thi s was the angel she had designed for the White Hous e Christmas tree that year! Talk about synchronicitie s and miracles. Attempts to Stop Me Over the years, as I attempted to heal, break free, write and get my book into print, I was harassed i n many ways. Over time, I paid more and more attention to the tr iggers that were sent my way to stop me from rememb ering and becoming free. These messages and triggers actually provided a gui de, a road map of sorts, toward discovering and dismantling deeper layers of my programming . For years, I have been tailed, my phones are usuall y tapped, people have been \"sent in on me\" in my co ntrollers' attempt to reprogram and regain control of me. Othe r people were 'sent in on me' in a timely fashion, such as in 1992 when Patrick Stone and I 'bumped into' Dutch Schroeder , his Baylor University coach , who just happened to be vacationing on Maui during the exact same tim e we were writing the FBI chapter in Starshine . When we had lunch with he and his wife, he told us he was one o f Bill Sessions' friends. At that time, William 'Bill' Sessions was still the Director of the CIA. At other times, men in suits found me in homes of a cquaintances, beaches, restaurants, hotels and cabi ns alike and made their threats; physical and verbal. My car tir es were slashed, my mail was tampered with, often h eld back for months, only to mysteriously arrive in bunches up t o two years after the postmark date! Phone messages , powerfully, cryptically encoded and laced with prog ramming intended to keep me under control were play ed over the phone or recorded on my answering machine. Shri ll sounds and/or tones were also played over the ph one to tap into my programming. Disturbing written \"triggers\" intended to either frighten me into submission or k eep me from remembering, were sent by mail. "},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"As I ran for my life from state to state, two separ ate individuals rear-ended my car on the same day, within hours of each other. I was set up and programmed to pose for compromising photos in an attempt to blackmail me should the need arise.

The CIA Lends a Hand? Tennessee Bound But a breakthrough occurred. Ted Gunderson called to inform me that he had just heard from ano ther woman who lived across the nation, who had also sent him her memory work about being used as a sex slave to Ronald Reagan . Although it was a terrifying time for me, it also w as an amazing time of discovery for all of us. Mark Phillips , her so-called therapist and deprogrammer flew across the nation and told me that \" Jimmy Carter's people \" had called him in an attempt to stop him from meeti ng with me. I flew Mark and Cathy O'Brien to California to meet with me for the first time and I put on a seminar where they were the featured speakers . Mark Phillips knew all about my programming . Looking back on it now, he seemed to know way too m uch . He asked me if I had \"a twin sister who was two inches shorter than me.\" This was a very powerful key and code into the programming of my \"inner twin sister,\" Sharon, and this seemingly simple statement controlled my b ody in a very intimate way from the outside, showing me whil e in normal consciousness that I was indeed a robot , and not in control of my own body. Shortly after Mark and Cathy's arrival and seminar, a series of events occurred i ncluding an accident and ensuing hospitalization of the pers on that was living with me as my safe person . Mark Phillips explained that I was not safe in California and on ce again I ended up running. I paid to fly Mark, Cathy and I back to his mother's home in Charlotte, Tennessee where we began my process of what we the n called \"deprogramming.\" Several weeks later, with nearly 1 0 years of recovery behind me, this so-called \"retired?!\" CIA operative made dramatic changes in his living arrangements just to \"help me deprogram .\" After relocating across the country, to a home in A rab, Alabama where I paid all domestic expenses for the three of us , a large sum of money for traveling expenses for b oth he, his girlfriend Cathy, and myself, and a large 'consulting fee ,' this renegade CIA operative read my lengthy jour nal entries daily for a year and a half and agreed that in his own words, \"the memory work contains absolute elements of fac t laced with verifiable details .\" But one and one-half years , forty-two journals , and $50,000+ traveling and living expenses later, Mark Phillips informed me that nothing had ever happened to me... nothing what-so-ever! Cathy O'Brien said, \" Well, you should be happy that nothing happened and that your children have not been abused !\" I couldn't believe she was saying that, after al l the common details of our histories we had shared . I was devastated and went to bed and could not eat for three days a nd remained non-communicative and totally subdued for nearly a month afterwards . After all this time of intensely focused attentio n on my history, Mark informed me that I had never even been abused, and that I just had a big imagination . But, he had seemed to appreciate that I was around to cover all of his expenses . I suspect that Mark is some kind of \" containment agent \" who is being directed through his \"handlers\" whos e motivations ultimately serve the New World Order . Through his containment expertise, the information I have conveyed to you in this book you are now rea ding was delayed in reaching you by nearly seven years . After I moved, I found out that Mark had initially told Walter Bowart (author of Operation Mind Control and eyewitness t o my use with Bob Hope in Palm Springs) that I was schizophrenic , and since then, I have uncovered a string of lies he told others in an att empt to discredit me . I also reconnected with another Kissinger survivor that Mark Phillips had worked with for a time. Mark Phillips told her the same thing he told me - \" THIS NEVER HAPPENED TO YOU!\" With my trust shattered, Ted Gunderson, Catherine Gould, Margaret Paul, Walt er Bowart and many others supported me in what I knew to be the truth of my l ife . I left that home where I had paid all expenses fo r Mark"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Phillips and Cathy O'Brien and went to live in Carb ondale, Illinois. I had a slower pace there and lif e was sweet while the situation lasted. It was a time of rest a nd recuperation as the final integration I had achi eved in 1996, solidified into even greater strength and unificati on while I remained safe. Baby Monarch Breakdown After a suicide attempt and hospitalization in Cali fornia, Kelly was released to me and even went to high school for a short time in Carbondale. My heart was broken whe n in June, after only being with me for a few month s, she announced that she missed her Southern California l ifestyle and the rest of her family, and told me sh e was leaving. Due to her un-recovered, still programmed state of mind, Kelly was not free to make up her own mind, a nd was often puppeted by our controllers and the inner web of programming that dictated her actions. After sh e left, an opportunity arose and I moved once again, this time to South Carolina in a quest to open a healing cen ter. All the while, I continued writing my sequel to Starshine, the book you are reading now. Going to Carolina to Open a Healing Center Over the years of my escape, Kelly's programming began to further break down , partially due, perhaps, to the lack of contact with me. In turn a series of suicide attempts landed her again in th e hospital . Twice I flew to California and brought her back home with me. During these int ense times, Kelly had lucid moments where she told me she knew everything that had happened. She talked to me about white vans, limos, being in London, hand signals, being sexually abused, and made me promise I would write about the drugs and how the doctors drugged her, wh ich she told me was destroying her brain . These medical doctors felt my daughter was psycho tic, because they were unaware of her programming. Kelly thanked me in a c ard on Mother's Day (see photo section) for her fre edom, and as we spent time together she relayed more and more events that she remembered, which validated my own experiences . Knowing what a crucial step it is for mind control victims to wear a watch, I bought Kelly a new watch . One day while we were swimming in a nearby lake, Kelly look ed me right in the eye, took the watch from her wri st and purposefully dropped it into the lake. I bought her several other watches and she did the same thing. She was not \"allowed\" to monitor the time and her programming d ictated that she lose it, quickly, before she got h urt for disobeying her program. My move to South Carolina to plan and coordinate a healing center for mind control survivors fell thro ugh but God was not to disappoint me in my desire for the heali ng center. Although I could not yet see the perfect ion of the Divine plan, I was soon to begin on a path that wou ld lead me to the creation of a healing center for survivors, a center furnished with the latest, state-of-the-art technology, with the capability of bringing survivo rs into recovery and whole brain synchrony in a more efficient and q uicker manner than my years in 'talk therapy' ever could. The psychotherapy I received, although helpful, didn't touch or recognize the powerful programming that ru led my every action, and couldn't help me learn to not dis sociate. EEG Neuro feedback helped me learn to not dissociate and to be more present and attentive. By April of 1997, Kelly was diagnosed Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) by two separate therapists, one in North Carolina and one in South Carolina. In previo us years, since 1988 I had attempted to get Kelly i nformed, qualified help in and out of California, but her fa ther denied her right to see any therapist who had any awareness of the one thing she needed in order to heal. He inter viewed each therapist I recommended, and if they ha d any knowledge of DID or ritual abuse, he would not allo w her to see them. But, once again I created a home and in my attempt to help my daughter, I began studying and t raining to become a certified EEG Neuro feedback Cl inician. I bought an EEG machine and began working with Kelly at home. She responded well to the neurotherapy, bu t was reaccessed and soon became completely catatonic. But by the summer of 1997, when my daughter's worsening condition rendered her tota lly catatonic and non- responsive; unable to eat, drink, walk, talk, use t he bathroom or move, I was forced to hospitalize he r . Luckily, I found a female psychiatrist who had read my book, w as familiar with MPD, ritual abuse and government m ind control, and was willing to admit my daughter to th e hospital while enacting the security required to keep her safe."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"While she was hospitalized, another recovered survi vor and I gave an inservice training for the hospit al staff. I also completed further EEG Neurofeedback training and op ened my own business. One time when I visited Kelly in the hospital, my car window was smashed , my briefcase, mind control literature and the electronic equipment I used to speak public ly was stolen . And to top it off, New Year's Day, 1998, the Holistic Health Care Clinic that housed my new EEG Neurofeedback business and t he EEG Spectrum equipment that I used to help victims and non-victims alike, was totally destroyed by fire . Although the official fire department report was that the fire was the result of faulty w iring, I felt the fire was due to arson. To validat e my suspicions, and just in case I forgot and needed \"reminding,\" t wo bags of the ashes from that fire were mysterious ly delivered to my home. Later in the year when another Bob Hope su rvivor visited me, I had to call the local police t o report a man who was surveilling us late at night outside my home. And, as recently as February 1999, as I sent out the initial copies of this manuscript, my phone lines t o my office were cut and I was tailed. Each time I am harassed, instead of silencing me, i t spurs me into greater action , and the result is another radio interview, another book or article, and more speaki ng engagements . I still stay as public as I can, speaking publicl y whenever I am asked, so I can continue to share the truth. This harassment cannot and will not stop being used against victims attempting to live free, until thi s dark system of mind control is exposed and brought to light. \"For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heav enly Father also will forgive you.\" -- Matthew 5:14 \"But I say to you that hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you.\" -- Luke 6:27 Brice Taylor - Thanks for the Memories, pp 272-274 Chapter Thirty-five Secret Societies What's the Secret Goal at the Top of Freemasonry? Answer: A Luciferian New World Order Living in and amongst those planning the New World Order as their programmed mind file, meticulously recording their deeds and activities, has allowed m e to be here now to report their plan to you. Their agenda includes keeping the populations of the world under control as they hold the key to secret knowledge . Knowledge is power . If you are uninformed as to their secret agenda a nd especially of their use of advanced mind control technology in order to bring about their plan, then you can't protect yourself or begin to work toward stopping this plan. If there is any one thing I could tell you about th e inner workings of the New World Order it's that it is subtle , organized and calculated . This plan has an agenda that spans generations with obvious long-term goals -- as long term as the intergenerational abuse pattern that wa s passed down through my family creating within our generational line Multiple Personality Disorder "},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"And, I can tell you that the New World Order plan serves a belief system that is based on power and control , confusion, greed, and the use and manipulation of o thers, most often without their consent . The system's \"cogs\" are well oiled and greased, and are interlaced and protected by mens' secret societies like the Masons , who have at the pinnacle of their organization a belief in secret k nowledge. The Masonic order is funded from the bottom up by f irst through third degree Masons, hoodwinked and mesmerized into working for the agenda of those mem bers at the top-an agenda they work \"toward\" knowin g but they aren't allowed to know until they arrive at th e top through oath and initiation to possess the el usive \"secret knowledge .\" Found in Morals and Dogma , the cornerstone of every higher Mason's library, in the 32°d Chapter (Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret) are subtle hints of the character of this 'secret knowledge, ' specifically geared toward the 32°d Degree Mason (Master of the Royal Secret). Here, in the guise of acknowledging a Universal Equilibrium between good and evil, as the natural balance and harmony o f earthly existence, it promotes the acceptance of the belief that evil actions are a necessary counter-balance to goo d ones and asks the aspirant to accept this dichotomy in human affairs. From this sublime seed of half-truth, evil is allow ed flourish within the protective secrecy of the organization . To gain this knowledge, a man must go through a ser ies of Luciferian initiations and, as he progresses toward the top, he finds that he is trapped into ke eping the secret, through threat of consequences, i ncluding death . Once gaining the upper levels, he believes that he or his family will be killed if he should ever divu lge the secret knowledge. This initation where he is ultimately compromised i nvolves blood ritual and rape . Now many of these men have had to \"sell their soul to the devil ,\" taking an oath through satanic ritual to serve a nd protect their fellow lodge brother regardless of the deeds done in order to accomplish that. Through the secret handshakes and signals they give to each other, they alert one another to the needs of a brother and thereby this fellow memb er who may be in court for charges of criminal activity, or appre hended by the police for breaking the law, is prote cted by his \"brother.\" It may be a judge, who when a case is presented bef ore him, sees a brother in trouble, and looks the o ther direction, allowing the lodge brother to go free or with light sentencing . Or, it may be an attorney who finds himself unable through the court system to really \"defend\" his client, as he secretly serves the system in whi ch he is oath bound. Often in court cases throughout the legal sy stem, children who are sexually or physically abused are sent back to live with a perpetrating parent while the o ther parent seeking protection of their child is se nt away, alone and powerless to do anything to protect their child . All this happens because a judge or an attorney is part of an organization that has at its very foundation, protection of its members, right or wrong, and sometimes prote ction at all costs . Are you aware that many of our Presidents have been Masons ? In fact, the majority have. This means that they have taken an oath to serve their organization and the brothers who belong, without question, even abo ve and beyond God and country. Instead of justice we have camaraderie. Instead of protecting citizens, especi ally our youngest ones, we have a system of individuals who serve each othe r, blindly I might add, without question of right or wrong, good or bad , without consideration for the Constitution and th e high spiritual ideals set forth for our country. We have instead a \"boys club,\" where many men join in order to belong, to be a part of a grou p that they may believe furthers civic interest, financial gain , and offers security. Our nation is undermined by this group that operate s in the dark , shrouded by secrecy and serving to protect their fellow lodge members above all else-including truth and justice . A man cannot serve the Lodge and at the same time s erve God, for the good Lord calls us to love one an other, to uphold one another, to love and serve our fellow hu mans, to protect and love the children, and cause n o harm . This Masonic Order , this secret men's society, as harmless as it may seem to it's members teeming at the bottom, demands an oath to allegiance over truth, brotherho od over justice, and it often serves a need to prot ect a man's financial assets. There is no way a man can choose God's values when he is bound by an oath to protect and defend his fellow lodge member without question . Even if a first-degree lodge member doesn't find himself \"called upon\" to protect a brother, he is still serving a master at the top of the pinnacle, without knowledge of wh at the top directors-the 32°d and 33rd Degree Masons--are doin g. Yet these worker bees at the bottom fuel the deeds and goals of those brothers at the top, who possess the secre t knowledge , and use that secret knowledge. I can tell you from"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"personal experience of being there, that it is not of God but is evil in nature. It seeks control for power and ultimately it wreaks havoc and destruction upon the innocents that may be in its path . A man cannot serve two masters. Those who are Masons are taught secret han dshakes and hand signals that pass secretly between members without outsiders' knowledge that a subversive agen da is occurring, right there before the public's ey es. This secret communication between lodge brothers guarantees tha t the members are protected. But I guarantee you that unless a brother rises through the ranks, he won't find out that what he is supporting at the top of the organi zation he has sworn allegiance to, is the highest evil known to m an . To possess this secret knowledge, men allow their morality and conscience to be strip ped away; they have to, because the secret knowledge has to do with bringin g in the New World Order through atrocity that comes with power and control, certainly not love and service . It is pure evil, shrouded in secrecy, and masked as a service organization . It's quite the opposite, as the many emerging victims of satanic rituals at the han ds of high-ranking Masons and Shriners will attest to . If you are currently a Mason, you may want to kno w that the secret knowledge at the top of your organization entails the ritualized abuse of young women who are raped on an altar as part of an initiation process . I know because I was there . It happened to me. I was taken to outdoor places in the 50's and 60's and subjected to satanic rituals performed by vario us men's fraternal societies, including the Masons and Shriners. I have also known and listened to other women who wer e healing from this mind control abuse, whose fathe r's were Masons and through that affiliation came to be youn g members of Job's Daughters or the Eastern Star , and were healing from the mind control abuse they suffered i n secret. \"For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth is na med, that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with might thro ugh his Spirit in the inner man, and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through fa ith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may have the power to comprehend with all the saint s what is the breadth and length and height and dep th, and to know the love of Christ which surpasses know ledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God .\" -- Ephesians 3:14 Chapter Thirty-six The Council’s Plan I began passing messages to and from the Council ea rly on, and in those days my use at that level had to be earned. On an occasion where I was sent to deliver messages adroitly to a group of men aboard a ferry in Canada , my reliability and security was finally proven. After the debriefing from that trip, Henry learned where and how this group would covertly funnel funds into Canada. He c lapped, shook my hand and said, \"Congratulations, y ou've passed this level!\" I didn't 'officially' begin working for the Council until I was 'of age' in 1969, when I turned 18. Up until then, as I've stated, they were very cautious, watching and testi ng me from a distance as I functioned at the White House and in other private settings where one of their contacts could report back to them my progress. My involveme nt with them increased over the years as they witnessed my relia bility. I never violated that trust, couldn't think to, and worked amongst them for many years. Henry was the Council's mastermind and I was his other brain so he could keep the whole plan, and everyone involved, straight and org anized. "},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"One day, a group of powerful men met in a room in t he Wrigley Mansion high atop the hill in Avalon on Catalina Island. I was there supposedly to serve the men bev erages and light snacks on silver platters. Hours b efore the meeting I was kept in isolation in a side room. Two men in suits injected my arm with drugs and I was readied, like always, before use. I was dressed in a very expensi ve white eyelet, embroidered cotton dress that was provided for me to wear. One man that stands out was a tall man in a dark pi nstriped suit. He had thick white hair and sometime s wore glasses . He was often at these Wrigley meetings . The meetings seemed very important and secretive . Afterwards, I had sex with different men I was assi gned to. I met with them on private yachts or rooms in the Wrigley Mansion. Some of them were possessive of my time and didn't realize who I was; they thought I was just a maid I guess. Some even tried to bribe me with mone y, jewelry or trips. Jeff Foltz , Craig's best friend and USC oral surgeon, went wi th us, on occasion, to Catalina when these meetings were being held. Craig and I sailed over with Jeff and his wife or flew on seaplanes. Jeff cued me to different places at the Wrigley Mansion and other sites on Catalina Island. Consciously it seemed that we were just tou ring the Mansion with friends, but at certain areas Jeff wou ld say certain words and press my hand in the middl e and say a word or two and then we would walk on. I was a robo t and he talked to me like I was retarded. I follow ed closely behind Jeff as he walked us through the Wrigley Est ate. It seems like this was done to keep me from co nsciously remembering being there at the Estate later on. Jef f took me into rooms that were all beautifully deco rated in pastels. He held my hand, despite the fact that Lis a, his wife, was there. No one really spoke and I f elt like a very small child being taken around by an adult. Of cour se, at the time my conscious personality wasn't pre sent, so I was not aware of these events. Later, on this same trip , I went to meetings to assist. At times, Henry was there. He wasn't in office at the time but to him that only meant he \"could do more with his hands less encumbered,\" at least that's what he said. During my use as a tool to coordinate liaisons betw een the Council and the President, when a President was flown places, like aboard large military aircraft, I was briefed and sent along so that I could apprise him of situations or 'key' reasons for his being in certain locations. F or example, if the Council deemed it necessary to control the attitudes of a certain branch of the military in order to have their 'full cooperation' in a str ategic military position or assignment, they would brief me in the complete att itude required. They would supply me with the correct words for whomever (President, Vice- President, Bob Hope, etc.) was delivering the speech to the troops. Then the troops would respond favorably because their programming w ould be reinforced, creating the desired effect - t hat is - their full obedience and cooperation . I accompanied Nixon, Reagan, Ford, Bush and others in these ways, bringing them information from the C ouncil. Later, I was debriefed about the results of my time with the President. I also reported what the skill fully trained parts of me carefully recorded during the entire 'a ction,' including reporting back what the President said, how it was received by the audience and any messages the Presi dent wanted to send back to the Council. As I explained before, the Council is made up of a secret and powerful group of men wh o are not public and meet in the shadows . Their true power and ability to rule over the masse s comes from the fact that they are publicly unknown . They exist in their own environments, with little o utside contact . But they have many highly tested, tried and true programmed or aligned individuals who go o ut and do their work, bringing back the information they need, making the contacts necessary to insure the success of their mighty plan for world domination. They have the power to insure the election of a Pre sident , to bring a celebrity to fame , to decide the fate of a nation , to bring about war , to incite riot , to bring down whole cities or countries , to kill out a certain ethnic race , to introduce a new chemical into the food of the masse s for control , to loose upon a community a new virus , to decide which people are to live and which are to die . They gave direction to people like Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Henry Kissinger and the Rockefeller's , but they are not ignorant enough to allow a public iden tity to make them vulnerable to any kind of investi gation or public knowledge of their lives and their purpose. They seek people out in their own time ; people don't contact them . Sometimes the contact comes in the form of anothe r person slipping a message in or telling someone t o be at a certain place at a specified time, but their whereabouts is not ever known . And to report this to you, I had to dismantle lots of death programming that was instal led in an attempt to keep me from remembering any o f this. "},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Geneva There were times when the Council met in Geneva and I was taken there so they could send informati on and messages, via my mind files, to people who weren't supposed to be publicly connected with them. All th is cross communication was sent safely through me and no one would have suspected who I was or what type of sec ret information I contained. Henry usually put the info rmation in my head and sent me in with instructions - usually amusing ones - to the men at the meetings in Geneva and other places. These men don't just want to control the world; they already do that to a certain extent . The rules the Council had between its contacts was that they were never to have physical contact, or talk by telephon e . They decided where a message would be posted, via c ryptic codes that only they understood , and often placed them in a certain section of the n ewspaper . Like for instance, they would weave the place and time of a meeting into th e business investment section if one had to be call ed on short notice. Otherwise meetings were set up ahead of time and th ere was no contact in between . In cases of emergency or crisis they could use someone like me to deliver secretly coded messages. The men they are networked into are some of the mos t powerful businessmen in the world - s teel magnates, furriers, oil and gas company owners, telephone company owner s, media owners, munitions makers, among others - and their business dealings are highly illegal. They break all the rules and laws set up to protec t small businesses from monopolies. They create huge monopolies . They control the world through the economy . Most people who opposed them didn't have a chance. They simply ran them out of business, got them prosecuted legally, or manip ulated them in any way that was successful to insure they maint ained total control. Secret Rendezvous in the Pacific During the late 70's and early 80's the Council often met out in the middle of the ocean, aboard ya chts, where they could all come together anonymously . They sailed or motored around until they connecte d with each member. They navigated to precise areas where a yacht would be w aiting. Everyone had to be expert navigators and Cr aig's dental friend, Jeff, was just that. He constantly read a c omplex nautical map with special tools and combined that information with the placement of the stars in the sky in order to deliver me to a preplanned destinat ion. He had to navigate to different places around the Channel Isl ands to areas we were supposed to go to. I was usua lly the first to be picked up by the yacht the Council was to meet o n, because I was the least important and they didn' t want to waste these important men's time. The captain pulle d us in close, side-by-side, and the member aboard the other yacht would leave his yacht and come aboard. Each m an was picked up in this way. There were usually th ree or four rendezvous after they picked me up. The men never arrived on the same yachts but used d ifferent vessels and crews so as not to ever be identified . Once every member was picked up they met in the l argest room on board ship, and I was brought in to sit at the table during cer tain junctures when they wanted to send a message b ack to the President, foreign leaders, etc. This way later, I just delivered the message to whomever they directe d me, usually during sex, and so everything remained anonymous. Reagan was a big receiver of messages during his pr esidency. I was kept very busy delivering to him an d he 'followed' orders to a 'T.' The group was \"very ple ased with his performance,\" were the words they use d. Pete Wilson was the same way and so was George Bush. Any way, the Council met on board yachts, had meetings, and then were navigated back to planned areas. They never met in the same place twice and everythi ng was done with precision . That was one of their favorite words -\"PRECISION\" - and they always had the very best of everything. They even had \"the chessboard\" on board . They showed me one move each time and I was instr ucted to watch VERY CAREFULLY because there was no room for a mist ake. Later I delivered the move on the chess board to Henry in New York . The chess move was ALWAYS taken back to Henry . [This solidify that Kissinger was an outer Buffer o f the same Jewish families. He was a Jewish too! – MC] Disguises To Protect Kissinger Henry literally built me so I could be a safe arm t o reach out and touch the Council. I flew to New Yo rk regularly in the 70's and 80's. Just a quick trip to deliver the information to Henry. He had various and sundry di sguises for me that he used to protect himself. A man in a suit al ways picked me up at the airport in a limo and gave me a bag. I"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"knew to go to the restroom and change into everythi ng in the bag, which included clothes, shoes, wig, teeth overlays, make up, purse, everything I needed was t here. Craig had made me several sets of maxillary a nd mandibular overlays that I could just snap onto my teeth. I looked totally different and the switch wa s to be total and complete when I looked at my image in the mirror. \" Become the image,\" Henry told me. So I changed my f ace, my voice, my walk; everything I was told to alter, in order to fit the image. I took the bag filled with my clothes back to the man in the limo and he put it in the front seat next to him and escorted me into the backseat. Aft er I switched personalities and dress, he closed the glass window between the seats and never had conversation with me from that time on. He let me out at Henry's office, which was a large, older, very cultured building and someone escorted me right to Henry's office. I sat down in an upholstered chair across from Henr y's dark wooden desk. He snapped his fingers and ra n his hand before my face to ready me for debriefing. I told him what the Council advised and the final message was the Chess move . He was very anxious to get that and always had me double-check the information so there wouldn't be any miscommunication. I was programmed that it wasn 't possible for me to ever make a mistake. After I delivered the information to Henry, he walk ed me to the door and gave me a small piece of fold ed paper to give the driver. I think it may have had my airline instructions on it or something. For some reason I never flew with a round trip ticket, and always had the return flig ht booked under a different name than the one I use d on the initial leg of the trip. The driver gave me the special bag that now had all my original clothes in it, and I would go back into the public restroom and change. Then he took m e back to the airport in New York and I'd fly to LA X. Usually my Mom or Craig would pick me up. It was a long tri p but didn't seem like it because I was programmed to sleep. They were always proud that the precision was so go od that I could be back within 24 hours or less. So mehow they 'folded' that amount of time and I never missed it. My assignments often began or culminated on Friday or Saturday night but usually I was home by Saturday. These mee tings with Henry usually took place at the end of t he work week. He liked to have the information delivered to him at that time because he would have the weekend to mull it over, undisturbed and uninterrupted by any other bu siness. He said, \" That's the secret to my success-FOCUS ,\" then he would smile and take a cigar out of a case on the table. He also had a separate apartment away from home where he did his best thinking and strategizing. I met with him there, also, but always had to do the disguise routine before I met him anywhere. When I returned home I was programmed to have chees e Danish to 're-mind' me to forget. Even when I was having therapy sessions with Stuart Perlman, I was program med to have cheese Danish on the mornings I had the rapy sessions with Stuart by phone. I was also cleverly programmed to misdial Stuart's phone number by one number. Every time I dialed his number I would get frustrat ed and wonder why I kept dialing the wrong number, and every time it was the same wrong number I dialed. My cont rollers had me dialing a number that contained a co de to remind me to maintain security. During this period, I often met with Henry or others, so the Danish wa s the 'icing on the cake,' and served to make sure I didn't ever remember. I was still meeting with Henry when I wa s in therapy with both Stuart and Margie. My controllers told me they were trying to shore me up so I would make it to the end of my job in the year 2000. Jaws My job was to be over in the year 2000, and program med parts of me were told that I was to be shot in the head and dropped overboard out in the middle of the Pacific where no one would ever miss me, including the shar ks. In order to impress me, they made me watch shark-feeding fre nzies. One time after Craig and I returned from a l ong weekend sail and scuba diving trip, another dentist friend of ours came over and said, \"You weren't sc uba diving in the Channel Islands this weekend, were you? They we re having shark contests and were chumming the whol e area!\" Shark themes were used heavily , and I was continually reminded by the Shark diver 's wristwatch that I was given to wear. My job as a go-between from the Council to others was my most important task. Bob was 'my own er' and Henry masterminded their plan, but the Council alwa ys called the ultimate shots. They said I was their s until, \"the end of time,\" and that time for me was supposed to be the year 2000. Then they said I could sleep with the fishes. Deep inside I couldn't wait until it was over. "},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Although the Council didn't ever meet on the same y achts, when they did meet, there often was an aquar ium on board with sharks in it that was used to remind me what would happen if I stepped out of line. Craig a nd I had previously been directed to the big theatre with th e stars on the ceiling on Catalina Island to watch James Bond movies. I constantly gazed upward at those stars pe r programmed instructions to, \"look at the stars to be safe and forget.\" I also was made to watch while a man in a suit thre w an attendant into the shark aquarium when it was feeding time . He said to the man, \"You wouldn't mind standing i n for the fish this morning so this young lady can see what her fate is if she steps out of line?\" The attendant looked at him quizzically and then the s uited man threw him into the tank and quickly poured a pan of fish and blood all over the poor man in the water. The s harks went right for him. He screamed and flailed his arms but it didn't last long. It was horrific and terrifying. The suited man looked me in the eye, and in a very quiet, soothing tone of voice said, \"There, see what happens if yo u step out of line?\" \"Yes, I see,\" I agreed, wholeheartedly. This type of life and death terror tactic is enough to dissociate a person for a very long time, espec ially if they are under mind control. This shark theme ran throughout my victimization. After my children were born, we were at a theme park and all donned wet suits to swim with th e fish; some were even small sharks. Danny and Kevi n were even given small rubber sharks in order to remember the experience. The message was always the same, \" Step out of line, you will be fed to the sharks.\" By now the y probably only need to use virtual reality traumas . Kauai Central Location I was relocated on Kauai because it was a remote ar ea with easier access to me, unencumbered by my fam ily. It was a two-year phase. Then they didn't have to coordina te things so carefully between us all. I was free t o go on their assignments and I was used heavily. They flew me to New York, England, South of France, Italy (Rome), the Netherlands, even Catalina and the Channel Islands, except now I was helicoptered to the yachts and te thered in on a chair. Often it was a two-seater helicopter, the 'glass bubble' type. The helicopter pilot seemed co nnected to the yacht as they radioed to coordinate the rendezvous with precision. When I lived on Kauai I was taken d irectly from the meetings of the Council to Henry, going through the whole disguise bit, and then returned to the i sland. I was usually gone two days (48 hours) or less, and when I returned I slept a lot because I had been without sleep or food and the time difference caused jet lag. Although, t hey tried everything to nullify the jet lag so I co uld, as they called it, \"re-emerge into my life without stress or strai n.\" While I was on Kauai I even was reunited with Kelly (who still lived in California with her father) in England and France to \"sexulate\" some members in the royal fami ly and a violent leader in France. Kelly has person alities that speak French, also. It was necessary for both of us to know French in order to communicate with this m an. Kelly was trained to step into my shoes in the year 2000 and take over and I was supposed to give her a diam ond ring to make this an initiation. Further Council Adventures I was programmed with personalities to emulate Jack ie Kennedy's charm and dignity. Aristotle Onassis was a powerful arm of the Council , with the ability to move business holdings around . The Council poured money into these businesses and used people like Onassis as a front, since they had to remain anonymous . That was how they used a lot of business tycoons . The men who operated independently were the most ideal since they could maneuver without the oversight of a large corporation or bus iness partners. Some of the richest entrepreneurs i n the world were used this way and I was sent into them to have sex and deliver Council messages. I met with many of these men in the open seas on yachts for anonymity and se curity. I also was rendezvoused with Reagan and Bush out in the middle of the Pacific during Reagan's Presiden cy. They were on separate yachts, and met with me during a t hree-day sailing trip with the Foltz's. Jeff Foltz secretly brought the drugs necessary for my use on board the sailing vessel we rented for sailing trips. Ile also broug ht electronic equipment, including a black box with wires that he hooked us up to; all three of us, his wife, my hus band and myself, for programming. This happened before and a fter I was used. He probably got his 'tune up' befo re the sail. The Council worked Reagan and Bush a lot , giving them instructions. Reagan went along blindly while Bush seemed to know more but not as much as Henry . I always slept with Reagan on the yacht he was on and then"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"delivered the message to him. I was delivered to Re agan and Bush as Jeff navigated to a precise destin ation and when we came alongside their vessel I crossed 'over the rainbow' as I came on board. Sometimes I spent the entire night sleeping with Reagan after I had delivered th e message because, he said he would, \"prefer compan y while out in the middle of the lonely Pacific.\" So I stayed, and the next morning Jeff came back and picked me u p and transferred me back. As soon as I got on board, Jef f immediately stun gunned me in the back. My husban d and Jeff's wife stayed down in the kitchen until Jeff finished with me, which meant drugs and the use of the blac k box. In later years, instead of an injection, the drug was a circ ular, oral wafer, like a small water chestnut . Then Jeff would announce to our spouses, \"Time for lunch!\" and they would start preparing lunch. After we ate, I would go take a very long nap or lay out on the deck and sleep whil e we sailed to our next destination. We often moore d for the night in three separate areas; all strategically ma pped and navigated so I would be in place for the r endezvous. I always felt so out of it after these events and con sciously felt embarrassed that I was too tired or c ouldn't think to communicate with our friends. Now I know why. Certain members of the American Dental Association have been heavily involved in this project and many of the people from USC Dental School that Craig knew. Uncl e Charlie made Craig's way into USC, because Craig needed to be part of the project so he and Jeff could be \" prepared,\" to ready me for use at the highest level s with the Council. The Council stepped up their plans beginning in 1980 and on int o the 90's . Then it was supposed to be \"clear sailing,\" as their plans snowballed and they began reaping what had been earlier sown. Until in the year 2000, when they would be able to cinch the purse strings shut, thus, being totally in charge of everything w orldwide. But things didn't go exactly according to plan, especia lly regarding my situation. The Frontiers of the Mind They began to target more heavily, and more often, people that had been put in place over the years. T hey were bombarding them, certain individuals more heavily t han others, depending on their usefulness and power potential. People like Onassis, Iacocca and the Rockefellers who were part of 'level two,' and others. Anyone who made big money was targeted . The Council was apprised of the wealthy, and people like Henry went to great lengths to strategize how those with wealth could be brought i nto their game for the highest effect or benefit to the cause. Th e Council saw this as a huge game to attain total and absolute power by the dawning of the next century- the Age of Aquarius. As an Aquarian I was told I was heralding the advancement of the planet-the global transform ation to a new way of life through advanced technologies. They plan to \"market\" the mind/brain technologies t hey themselves have been using for decades, to the general public, and are doing so already. This will allow t hem to make mega money in this new market as well a s allow them to begin to educate the masses in regard to th e new technologies of the mind, \" The Frontiers of the Mind .\" But, while the public is spending vast sums of mone y on this new technology, they will also be conditi oned through advanced forms of electronics, harmonics, and subli minal conditioning to accept this shift to a 'new e xistence.' The Council plans are to have a robotical working class that won't cause any problems, but will simply wor k to supply the needs of the Elite-those who by their breeding and intellect are deemed worthy of being allowed to be \"awake\" so they can rule, live and create without any inter ference from the common man. They say that the work ing class already makes non-thinking robots of their own ever yday lives, and it might as well be more planned an d regulated so that others who want to create, invent, and othe rwise use their minds, can do so without hindrance from the common man. They view the \"common man\" with great disdain as a lower form of the human species. And they figure th at by the time the year 2000 rolls around, when the purse cin ches shut, and they are in full control, that peopl e will already be sufficiently conditioned and won't even be able to think to figure out or even be aware that a change has taken place. They see it as the perfect cover up for the continu ation of the experiments in mind control they have participated in and feel very assured that the public will never be able to discover what happened because the more in telligent pubic has been sufficiently \"tamed\" and conditioned to go along with the rest of the herd. Society is being weeded out right now, as minority species are being eliminated very specific ally by biological germ warfare and other tactics meant to insure the elimination of those less genetically favorable. They figure with the reduction of the population there will be sufficien t natural resources for the working class robots to support the genetically astute intellectuals who will be in pow er . Then, this is supposed to lead into a new age of pe ace . They"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"even unleashed New Age principles to target and con trol the groups of people they previously programme d while they continued developing the mind control technolo gy, in order to maintain control until the year 200 0 when, supposedly, no one would be able to think to questi on or cause problems. Our food is being tampered with, by the insertion o f food additives and substances like aspartame which can alter brain chemistry and affect our minds . Music and movies are another powerful tool used to condition the masses . The Council views these measures as the kind, humane way to han dle this matter, instead of a direct violent takeover , which would just cause even more chaos and human suffering. They envisioned that, this way, there would be no dissent and after the takeover there wi ll be no need for wars, ever again. These men don't believe in wars, but needed to use them to achieve their goals . As they see it, the rest of the species will be l iving in harmony, able to create and enjoy while the lower, now robot ical, forms of the human species do all the grunt w ork they are accustomed to: common labor, food production, and l ife maintenance for the higher forms of human speci es, the intellectuals, those who matter and are deemed elig ible to be awake. The Master Plan is Accomplished by Robots There has been a master plan for years and many, in cluding myself, were involuntarily enlisted to work for it, as Dr. Henry Kissinger , 'Mr. Global Internationalist,' masterminded much of their plan. My controllers viewed anyone with a small intellect as 'non-existing' anyway, so they will either be weeded out or retained on the mind-controlled work force that's already been created. Masses of daycare centers were targeted to insure t he success of the takeover , where large numbers of children from normal familie s were programmed because they will be the ones who will be of the age to resist or fight the Council plan . But now, many won't be able to because their mind s have been manipulated and conditioned during childhood, so they will go along with the global program . It is all a carefully laid out plan that has spanned decades an d generations, with one generation handing down to the next their inheritance. The children of the elite families, such as the Rockefeller's and Kennedy's will inherit a guaranteed future on a planet that can survive due to the fact that the population and, in turn, pollution, food suppli es, etc. will be totally controlled. These intellectual, genetically 'worthy' individual s plan to have their own guaranteed 'utopian dream wo rld' after they kill off the inferior human species that they believe are overcrowding a planet that cannot suppo rt us all . The Council feels that they are insuring the future of the spec ies of mankind by what they are doing . And, those from intergenerational ritually abused families and others will be placed under total mind control, to become the planetary 'workforce' so the elite doesn't have to waste their precious time on menial labor. The Coun cil feels everyone 'wins' this way because it puts the non-th inking and genetically inferior populations \"out of their misery,\" by taking their minds away, and insures a glorious future for the brightest intellects on earth. To them intellect is everything and without it, they think people should n't be allowed to waste precious time on earth , taking up space for those who can and will use their brains to crea te. They view this as a massive genetic clean up. Then, when their agenda has been met, the world wil l be free from ignorance and chaos. According to th eir reasoning, there will be no abortion issue because the genetically intelligent won't bear children by acci dent . There will be no wars because they won't have a need to use wars to manipulate pe ople for power or money . There will be no famines because there will be plenty of food gro wn naturally by the robot class and the world will no longer be overpopulated. Then, they can bring in their new fo rm of world government and there won't be fighting or resistance because the Elite will see eye-to-eye an d will all benefit, and are intellectually capable of understanding how they can all work together for the benefit of t hemselves. Crime will cease since the commoners, 'the robots' won't be able to think to commit acts of violence or any other forms of crime. The Elite think of themselves as intellectually above petty crime and will have no n ecessity of it since they will be getting their nee ds met, royally, by all of their mind-controlled 'worker-bees.' No m ore disease will be brought in by the 'unwashed' lo wer classes. So there will be less disease all-around because th e Elite will take immaculate care of their bodies a nd won't have to deal with the stress and strain created by the prob lems of today. These will have been eliminated by eliminating the source of these problems-the genetically deficient . The Council has guaranteed survival and freedom f or those at the top. What they have done to the human species in th is Twentieth Century is tragic and they justify it by the rationale that they are protecting the future of the human sp ecies by insuring that only the best specimens surv ive. "},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"The Council took a serious stand to clean up the en vironment as it served their needs for a healthy, p ollution-free, life-sustaining environment for their future progen y. Since they have access to, as well as direct, ma jor new discoveries in advanced technologies, they have dis dain for the uneducated, ignorant, common people wh o trash their own environment. They said that even animals knew better than to defecate in their own sleeping area. But this would be remedied in the future when the geneticall y deficient were weeded out and extinguished. They also were very condescending to those individu als who didn't eat properly or exercise. They take immaculate care of their bodies as far as health goes. They are fit and trim and they use natural medicine s . The American Medical Association is fashioned to prescribe drugs and perform various treatments that although they may be unsuspecting, tend to weed out the weaker species. The Council views the AMA's 'modern medicine' as barbaric . Their plans are to have mind-enhanced health associ ates, like some of the USC medical and dental gradu ates, who will provide the new health care for the Elite, aft er the takeover. Precision surgery with laser technology will make the so-called \"modern methods\" of surgery obsolete . Miracle medicines and herbs (God's pharmacy) will k eep the body healthy . An understanding of the way the electro-molecular energy field around the body operates will allow the healthy body to be kept in perfect alignment cr eating perpetual perfect health or it can be brough t back into alignment easily with the use of high-tech field va riation equipment. This will be the modern medicine of the future and upcoming doctors will be trained in these metho ds in order to further the evolution of the Elite. The Elite plan to enjoy total and complete health due to their tec hnology in electromagnetic fields . They also have antibodies against the diseases they let loose and make sure they are protected. Of course all of these findings came about by research and experiments on unsuspecting groups of people. The health care program they were attempting to imp lement in the United States was one they were hopin g would though so that the lower class robots would have a health care system to serve their needs in the futu re, while allowing the government, the Council and those invo lved in the global takeover to remain in control. A s you can see, it is a system designed for control. It is all about further conditioning the populace so that th ere won't be any drastic changes that would cause stress to the nati on or upset the apple cart. They believe they have learned what form of government would work best by installing di fferent varieties of governments in different count ries with leaders they chose , studied, and watched to see which form would be lik ely to meet their needs in the year 2000 and beyond . They saw different national governments as 'project s .' For awhile , they thought communism would be the best, until the mind control technolo gy showed them they could covertly rule the masses without communism . With this technology, they believe they can rule the masses easily and effortlessly, and governing can be limit ed because they feel all of the Elite will have muc h the same wants, needs, and goals. They already have the central banking system in place and have a master plan for the laws, rules, and regulations that will govern those that are left . Sons of the Elite are conditioned to be leaders in the New World . Robotic mind control won't be necessary for their compliance. They have been conditioned to accept this new agend a without being given all the information and will be allowed to be \"free thinkers,\" unless they don't follow directions . The Elite are used to having servants so this overall concept is not especially different for the m because they have been brought up to believe that they are born privileged , are of a superior genetic strain and have a respons ibility to lead . I was used, under mind control, to further many of these attitudes with the sons of many world figures . It was just a matter of conditioning them with the beliefs, a lit tle at a time, which would support the changeover . The egos of these young men have been very carefully created an d conditioned. Prince Charles' boys are possibly doomed to the same form of conditioning. The Council sees this as a planetary enhancement , with the globe entering a time of health, new exc itement, and abundance for those deemed capable of making a diff erence in the future of the human species. \"And I saw an new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away; and the sea was no more.

We Are Called To Love And so for many, ma ny years, Henry Kissinger and Bob Hope strategicall y placed me and members of my family in locations to further their interests. During those times, my chi ldren and I were used in various ways and prostituted to more w orldly-affluent, famous, publicly adored leaders an d entertainers than I care to remember. Personally, I would like to stay in denial and believe this neve r could have happened. But for the interests of many, I cannot a fford to believe anything less than what I have dis covered is the truth. I have chosen to share a fragment of these e xperiences with you so that you could know the leve l of technology that has been developed and to show you the danger of the ways those who carry a belief of power and control, and who at this time are out of alignment with their true spiritual nature, have misappropria ted their duties to our nation and to the world. Spiritually I have grown to realize that while the worldly Elite's positions are often determined by h eredity, and in the business world nobility comes from ability, amb ition, or success; in the eyes of God, nobility comes from those who serve others . Through all of my experiences at the hands of lea ders from all over the world, I have learned that to be a true leader is to know your stewardship to those you serve, not to gobble and hoard the benefi ts for self while fooling and robbing those who count on you, w ho elect and trust you to serve the good of the who le. I also know now that truly great leaders are humble and their joy comes from t he glorious privilege of serving others . And I will tell you, as would my precious daughter Kelly if she could, that the current leadership und er President Clinton is no different than the ones before . Indeed Kelly could start up the next chapter on W illiam Clinton and could tell you the size of his genitals, the perver ted ways he chooses to utilize his sexuality and ho w he, like many of the Presidents before him, is locked into the bo ndage of a power hungry system that will continue w ith each new President after him, unless this system is dismantl ed and a new system of governing, one based on the needs of the people, a true republic, born of God, for the good of the whole, is reinstated. But it will take each of us, all those who the Elitists feel have no intellect and no moti vation, to stand up and speak out for what we belie ve in---perhaps even sharing our 'simple minds and spiritual nature s' with those who for years have felt the right and the need to lord over us. For, once society has seen the proble m, the solution is in sight. I believe each individual is imbued with a gift fro m God to contribute to society as a whole and as ea ch individual finds their true purpose and joins in, contributing that gift, we will then have a full-bodied, rich o rchestration of individuals, evolving to the highest possible level s. That is when we as a society reach a more perfec t state!

Healing Healing spiritually, through a life such as mine, h as been my ultimate challenge, and God has continue d to keep my focus on this healing aspect, despite worldly opini on, which would lead me to seek in other directions . During the years of pain and suffering that led me out of mind control bondage, Margie Paul shared with me the fo llowing passage, by Emmet Fox, which I read constantly. It uplifted and strengthened me and reminded me of the truth. I would like to share it here with you. LOVE There is no difficulty that enough love will not co nquer; No disease that enough love will not heal; No door that enough love will not open; No gulf that enough love will not bridge; No wall that enough love will not throw down; No sin that enough love will not redeem... It makes no difference how deeply seated may be the trouble; How hopeless the outlook; How muddled the tangle; How great the mistake; A sufficient realization of love will dissolve it a ll... If only you could love enough you would be the happiest and most powerful being in the world... In 1998, when all of my former life lay in ruin aro und me, I heard the Holy Spirit ask me who was the one person I hated most ? The answer came quickly and easily. Silently I re sponded, \" George Bush ,\" since he was a man who repeatedly hurt my baby girl from very early on. Th e same day the Holy Spirit questioned me, I receive d a hospital advertisement in the mail cheerfully announcing tha t George Bush would be visiting a local hospital ju st 25 minutes from my home. I was devastated that people still looked at him as a person of honor, and associated him with charity and healing ? Then the challenge from Jesus came when he called me to love George Bush. I couldn't do that initially, it took many prayerful hours for me to a sk God to please change within me the attitudes tha t needed changing in order for me to love and forgive George Bush. Obviously, that didn't happen overnight, but it did take place, at first just for a fleeting moment and then for longer periods of time. That doesn't mean that I stop working toward exposing the system that has caused this mis use of human life, nor does it mean that I think wh at my perpetrators did was right or excusable. It simply means that no matter what they or anyone else does to me, they do not have the power to make me hate, or the power to take away my right to love, for love is my continu ing goal . Forgiveness I was confused and tormented as I awakened to the r ealization that my father and others had abused me in such horrific ways and that they had actually taken cont rol of my life for nearly 40 years. The awareness that churches had been places where I was often victimized , by individuals who I associated with being the mo st loving, added to my torment and bewilderment. I searched for answers , through reading about many religions, trying to f ind the truth, and one night I had a dream in which I heard the word \"Beatitudes.\" Upon waking, the word stuck in my mind and later, while attending a religion class at Pepp erdine University, I went to my professor and asked him what the word meant. He told me and later on that day, I wen t across the street to the Malibu Presbyterian Chur ch to speak to the assistant minister. "},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Little did I know that through my seeking, the Grea t Master Healer himself would appear to me, but tha t is exactly what happened. The minister ushered me into his office and after I confessed that I had been severely abused as a child, had Multiple Personality Disorder, had been forced to participate in satanic rituals where infa nts, children, and animals were killed - and as I went on and on - he looked at me in horror , and said, \" Get down on your knees, and ask God to forgive you of your transgressions . You are a sinner .\" The moment my knees hit the floor, Jesus appeared to me and said, \"Get up off your knees, and leave. You my child are innocent, you have done nothing wrong.\" Taking the authority of the Lord, over this human w ho stood ministering in His name, I did as commande d and left. I couldn't understand yet what Jesus was trying to help me understand. It took time for Him to reassure me that those acts, committed in a programmed state, acting from other person's commands and not from my own f ree will, were not my sin . In the days that followed, Jesus showed me that He wanted me to stand in the name of Mercy for others who had been similarly tortured and abused. Over time, He c alled me to minister and share His words of mercy a nd forgiveness with other victims who presented themse lves to me in women's shelters, at my office, at me ntal health conferences, and through letters of response to vic tims who wrote, pouring out their hurts to me after they read my book I know that this message from Jesus, one of co mplete forgiveness, touched the hearts and minds of the people I spoke with, as deeply as it did me because I saw the tears of relief and understanding well up in th eir eyes. God wants His people free. I had many experiences where His Angels demonstrate d that they were guiding me. I heard the Holy Spiri t whisper, \"get up from your reading, and go down to the Bazaa r.\" I hadn't known that there was a Christmas bazaa r at Pepperdine, but I followed the voice of the Holy Spirit and was led to a small purple book entitled, \" Angels Are Watching Over Me . \" And if I doubted that it was true, in the month s and years that followed, the voice of the Holy Spirit led me to books, places, and people to help me heal and gain freedom . Books even fell off of shelves in libraries , many of them reminding me that the Angels of the Lord were ever present and that I was not to worry. Other books I was led to helped me organize my heal ing in such ways that, when healing took place, it was core healing and not superficial or drugged. I often tell the story of the experience I had at t raffic school. During the early stages of my recove ry, despite the smile that betrayed my true inner feelings, I was s o full of repressed, subconscious rage that it ofte n found its release in driving too fast and I continually got t raffic tickets for speeding; one day I got two! Sin ce I was already on assigned risk and my insurance rates were extrem ely high, my husband suggested I go to traffic scho ol, so I did. The traffic schoolteacher was younger than I, but t hat day she had an important message for me. I had been wrestling with just how I was going to forgive thes e people who had done this to my children and mysel f. As I explained my dilemma she said, \" All you have to do is heal yourself so you have som ething left for giving .\" I know now that what she said was true and I understand th e wisdom because, now in a healed state, I do have much to give. And, I thank God for that. In Carbondale, Ill inois, in 1995, nearly one year after my final inte gration and deprogramming, I was working in the garden. It was a warm day and I luxuriated in the midst of the pea ce and solitude that I found among my tomato and zucchini plants. Very clearly, I once again heard the voice of the Holy Spirit, this time instructing me to go visit my fat her. \"God, you want me to do what?\" I couldn't believe I was being asked to go and visit this man who had t ortured and programmed me for so many years, besides it wasn't safe for me in California, I had actually been rape d there as 1 made my initial attempt to get Starshine into print in 1993. But I heard the words very clearly, \"Go visit your father, fly under your real name, st ay 24 hours and then return . An intelligence officer will approach you . Do not be afraid. Tell him what happened to you a nd to your children .\" I thought maybe I hadn't heard correctly. So, I too k this into prayer and in a very short while I knew I was to go to California. Soon God showed me a vision where I saw lights on in the White House symbolizing individua ls who"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"would wake up and help. Then He shared with me that , like the men's secret society (freemasonry) that has allowed secret knowledge to be passed between men , that He also had a secret society that was more pow erful - The Holy Spirit . Then He showed me that as men's secret societies fu nd and support each other, so shall God's people fu nd and support their own . He showed me that through Him, and in His time, the Holy Spirit would connect people and allow them to be of like mind , so the truth could come to light . Although I didn't actually understand how this wa s going to come about, I was encouraged. I booked my ticket, and the next day I went to Cali fornia, to the nursing home where my father was bei ng cared for. When I walked in, I was moved seeing my father sitt ing in a chair, withered and small, a whisper of th e physical stature he had been before. When he saw me, he immediately began crying, and through his tears he cried , \"I love you. I knew you'd come .\" I got down on my knees before my father and said, \" Dad, I forgive you .\" Looking me directly in the eyes, he replied in a childlike manner , \" I forgive you too.\" At that moment I knew without a shadow of a doubt t hat my father , this man who had tortured me for years , had no idea, no memory, no awareness of what he had done . Still crying he said, \" Jesus brought me here .\" This statement caught me totally off guard, as here was a man who together with my brothers had ridicu led and berated me for my belief in Christ for years. I had so much I wanted to ask my father, but was overwhe lmed with emotion. Trying to gather myself, I looked around h is room. There on his bookcase, was a golden spider web with a crystal spider in the middle . Woven into this art piece was a Ronald Reagan wristwatch . My thoughts raced to information an Intelligence officer \"in the know\" once explained t o me , that victims will surround themselves with their programming and ofte n will display objects that speak to that which the y verbally can't , as a form of subconscious communication. This spider web spoke to me deeply through subconsc ious communication, and although my father could no t tell me what he knew, he had carefully preserved this piece to speak what he could not . Again deeply touched, I asked him if I could have it. He said, \"Sure, take anything y ou want.\" My father and I cried together. There was so much I wanted to tell him and have him tell me but he was no longer able. But God knew that I needed to see my father this on e last time, in order to complete my healing and forgiveness process . And that day, I totally and completely forgave my f ather . I understood why he had done what he had done . As I stood to leave, I kissed him one last time a nd told him I loved him, and looking back I am so grateful that God led me to that culmination and co mpletion with my father. Less than three months after that meeting my father passed away . As I drove my rental car to the airport to fly back to Illinois I realized that the intelligence offic er experience had not yet occurred. But I was not to be disappointed because, shortly after I took my window seat on the aircraft, a distinguished looking black man took the isle seat . After takeoff he flashed his badge and identified h imself as White House intelligence for the last 29 years . Taking his business card out of an organizer, he laid it on the seat between us. Unconsciously, still bound to the proto col of my controllers, as much us I wanted to, I co uldn't pick up his card. Nervously, I thought to myself, 'Oh God, this is it' This suited man began by telling me, \" There are some things you need to know . One is that once in the company always in the company . Don't believe anyone that tells you they've retired from the company (CIA) .\" Next he said, \"When you speak publicly don't name the names .\" I told him I wouldn't. At that moment the words spo ken to me by the Holy Spirit in the garden, came ba ck to me, \"Tell him what happened .\" So, I told this man about the abuse of my childr en and myself that often led to our victimization in the White House. He told me that he thought women like me \"just like d to be with Presidents .\" And finally, as we walked off the plane, the words he s poke surprised me as I realized maybe this man had a spiritual"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"awakening, was serving a higher calling, and was on e of the 'lights on the White House' that God had s hown me. He said that he was committed to informing ministers o f churches to do their jobs in helping victims. I was encouraged. Over the years, what I witnessed in my father was s omething that I have noticed in many of the victims of the mind control projects. He was extremely inventive and fu turistic and had many personalities that were extre mely loving. My father designed and built solar water heaters th at he installed on the roof of our Woodland Hills h ome in the 1950's , and shared thoughts and ideas that continually asto unded me . Due to the shattering of his own psyche through the ritual abuse he endured as a child, cou pled with the mind control programming forced upon this already vulnerable man, he was never in control of his own mind. From birth, his free will was taken from him through the abuse he endured at the hands of his parents who th emselves had been through the same victimization pa ssed through intergenerational, subconscious mental illn ess. Then, in a final attempt to harness the comple te control of his daughter, the doctors at UCLA took the last ves tiges of my father's free will when they performed the brain surgery that gave them total control. Breaking the Denial That Holds Us Captive Honestly, I can understand the denial many of you may be faci ng in regard to all that I have shared with you , as I faced the same denial over and over. I did not want to believe that any of the reality that kept intru ding into my mind was real. Often I wanted to believe I was insa ne, and at times even wished I could choose to live out the rest of my days rocking back and forth in a drugged stup or in some sanatorium. Then not only in response to programming, but also feeling trapped in a pain and confusion I often felt I could not bear alone anot her day, initially, I had moments when I contemplated suicid e. But due to the ramifications that act would have had on my children, that was never a choice I could make. I h ad to keep asking God to strengthen me so I could f ace the painful reality and heal in order to make a differe nce in the lives of my children. Forget the Past, Live in the Present? It has been said that those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it and I believe this is part of the situation we face today because until now we haven't been told e nough valid historical information. Before my recov ery, like most Americans, I was more interested in my future than in my past but was soon forced to deal with it due to constant flashbacks. But what if a person's past ho lds a potent key to his or her future? And what if that past holds intergenerational and worldly information that when realized and righted will resonate throughout futu re generations, causing freedom and a better quality o f life? Knowing my past has set me free and I am grateful for the spiritual guidance that told me that I had to go ba ckward before I could go forward. Although dire cir cumstances forced me to revisit my past, I now know that the i nner work I completed in researching and healing th e dark, hidden areas of my own past will reverberate throug hout the spiritual genes of my progeny's future and I am glad for that. Don't Worry, Be Happy! At first when these bits and pieces of memory began surfacing in my mind, I was terrified and continua lly dismissed them, as others told me things like, \"You're just too tired. You have a big imagination. You have everything a woman could want. Why don't you just quit therapy, get a job and be productive. Stop living in the past. Don't worry, be happy!\" Or, new age belief systems that created comments like, \"These are only your past lives. What you put your attention and focus on grows. I don't choose to thi nk about negative things. I like to focus on the light instead of the darkness. I create my own reality. This is not part of my reality. If it's this painful to deal wi th and causing you this much stress, it must not be the right thing to do.\" [My experience is that we tend to “escape”. we comm ent such as above mentioned, to take refuge in wish ful thinking, to dissociate ourselves from responsibili ty. Subconsciously, we are afraid “WHAT IF it is tr ue?” – MC]"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":" The list was endless. But over time when these flas hbacks and thoughts intruded into my present life w ith subjects and events that didn't interest me (politics, glamo ur and glitz, golf, baseball games, football games, and sex orgies), I had to wonder and question what it all meant. Tha t started the quest that has led to my knowing and my understanding. I am hoping you, too, will be able t o overcome your own denial and to question these is sues put before you, because the safety of our children and, yes, even our human freedoms depend on it. Over time I have had a plethora of responses to the telling of my life history. People have come to their own conclusions, based on their own belief systems and understanding at the time . Over the years it has continually pained me to speak publicly, sharing bits and piece s of what happened to me in an attempt to stop this abuse and gain help for my children and others, only to finis h my speech, look out in the audience and see blank faces. Perhaps many were numbed by the magnitude of the in formation I delivered, or thought I had lost my min d instead of finding it. But I can tell you that my healing came from the one or two loving persons who threw their arms around me after I spoke , and with tears in their eyes that clearly communicated to me that they understood the magnitude of the what had happened said, \"I am so sorry this happened to you. What ca n I do?\" Celebrity Other people have said, \" At least you met famous people and had incredible e xperiences !\" In response, I say that the years of my life that I lived as a mind controlled robot to Bob Hope, Henry Kissinger and others were not mine, they were stolen from me. I was not consciously pre sent. Those years were tragically altered and woven with horrific and painful abuse that separated me from m y core self and from the family I love . I have painfully witnessed individuals and society as a whole, hold in a protective reverence the \"med ia-portrayed persona\" of many famous persons . I watched as people in all walks of life - housew ives, ministers, attorneys, newscasters, and professors, etc. - held firmly to their view of famous people they never personally knew , in order to maintain some sort of fantasy relationship or be lief system they held about these famous persons. People have said to me, \" Not Bob Hope , he wouldn't do these things ,\" and I am left to wonder why they need to hold onto their media-created reality in lieu of opening their minds and using their spi ritual discernment to examine the possibility that what myself and others are rep orting might be true. My controllers, the authors of this plan of enslavement, are counting on you to believe the med ia image they have thrust forward. They are counting on you to do nothing. Another person said to her husband, \" She must have watched too many X-Files !\" I shared that, with the exception of occasionally c atching a show at someone else's house while they h ad the television on, I haven't watched television since 1 989. I have never seen X-Files. But I know that thr ough media avenues, the authors of the New World Order Plan have been able to very cleverly hide this reality o ut in the open . I'll Do It My Way I can tell you that if I could only choose my life over again, I would leave all the 'celebrities' out of it and would liv e a simple, basic life, enriched with love and deep c onnection to God and my family . To me that is where life's richness lies, not in wealth or celebrity status. W ealth and fame have never been important to me, and thank God, because if I had been attached to the affluent life style I had been living in California, I never coul d have chosen to break away and go for my freedom, regardless of the cost. For me, there is no price tag on freedom and morali ty: it is priceless. In the earliest stages of memory breakthrough, when I had flashes of insight of what my husband and I were involved in, I had moments before my programming ki cked in, when I was lucid before I switched persona lities again, in order to try to figure out what to do. Th ere were many times before I left California and th e life I lived with my husband, when I begged him to heal and stan d with me. He could never hear me. Hand in hand on a walk"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"one day, I proposed, \"Let's sell the house and spen d the money on our healing; yours, mine and the kid s.\" He couldn't hear of it. In weeks that followed, he ret urned home from a conference and said, \"They asked us who we looked up to and I told them, you.\" \"God help us,\" was my reply and in total and compete devastation, I realized for the first time in my life, that I was bankrupt in m y marriage, that my husband did not serve the same God that many parts of me did. I felt alone, frightened and unpro tected by the lack of spirituality that I knew coul d have guided our lives together. During times when I devoted endless hours to exerci se and nutrition, people have said, \"You look too good to have been through that much trauma,\" and during periods when my expressed grief has left me looking pale and haggard, or over or under weight , people have said , \" You don't look good enough to have been used with c elebrities .\" I was forced to invest in hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of therapy ($300,000+) and physical t herapy (thousands of dollars) in order to heal. All I can say is that it is a miracle that my body is still i ntact at all, and I thank God for that. There are telltale signs of the abuse recognizable by those \"in the know,\" scarred skin from electroshock that left prod marks, and my eyes ofte n look as if something of an electronic nature has happened to me. But the major ailments I had while in the midst of my mind control are healed; the migraines are g one, the continual sinus infections, sore throats, breathing problems and hoarseness that often necessitated th e use of an inhaler are gone; no more colitis, stomachaches and nausea, constant fatigue and body pain. All these symptoms are gone. As my mind healed and I was able to hold my r eality mentally, and as I released the traumas of t he past, my body healed. My healing from this abuse is to God's glory and I know that without seeking and heeding the Holy Spirit's leading, I never would have made it out. \"It is not I, but the Father within me, He does the works. \" -- John 14:10.

So often, I witnessed the love of thos e under mind control who lived among and near me. These cre ative people, all full of so much love that, even w hen I lay the often hurtful mind control abuse experiences side b y side with who I knew in spirit they really were, the love I felt from them often blasted beyond their programming, a llowing their soul essence to shine through.

Chapter Thirty-eight A Mother and Grandmother’s Sorrow A GRANDMOTHER'S SORROW: SUE'S MOM A Family Torn Apart My husband was a welder and when we were first marr ied he worked at the shipyards where he got hurt. O ne night, while working in the dark, he ran into a steel plat e, hit his head, and was knocked unconscious. He su stained serious neck injuries and six months later his neck became very painful and shook uncontrollably. The diagnosi s was torticollis of the neck. He was in so much pain tha t he would try anything the doctors suggested; such as shock treatments, being injected with typhoid fever, endl ess experimental drugs, brain surgery and many othe r medical interventions. When he was 45 years old he was told by a doctor that he only had five years to live. H e wanted to be sure his young family would be taken care of so he bought all the life insurance he could get.

I begged and pleaded with hi m but I could not reason with him. He came home lat er and told me he had fired the older son. I was surprised that he hadn't fired the youngest son.

I helped him get it ready and l eft the room. A short time later when I looked in o n him, he was holding the tape recorder and crying. Later, I foun d out he had said that he had to fire the oldest bo y because the younger son held something over him. The older son asked if it was business and my husband said, \"No, personal.\" Our son asked, \"What was it Pop, did you have an af fair?\" \"Much worse,\" my husband answered. Years later, he went to his deathbed carrying the s ecret. The thought that it might be incest, child p ornography or any of these other horrors never crossed my mind. M y two sons are estranged. I've tried many times sin ce 1974 to talk to my sons, to get them to at least talk to on e another, but to no avail. The younger boy was wil ling but the older one said, \"No way.\" It hurt me so bad for so long I thought I would go crazy. One night I said t o God in my prayers, \"God, I can't handle this, you take over.\" In 1967, my husband had brain surgery to stop the p ain and shaking in his neck. They went down through the brain to sever the nerves that were causing the pain. It helped but he was in the hospital for a long time. A few years later he had a heart attack and finally had open-heart su rgery. There were complications. During the surgery he went without oxygen for four minutes. They said because he had brain surgery, his brain became swollen and he had edema of the brain. He was coma-like for 12 days. W hen he came out of it he was like a vegetable, didn 't know any of us. He was helpless, couldn't feed himself, go t o the bathroom or walk. After months of physical th erapy he was able to walk and could pick up food with his hand. His memory was partially blocked. This deficit impa ired his whole left side. He never regained all of his memor y. I took him home and took care of him. My daughter stopped by one day , which was not unusual, as she lived down the stre et. She asked if she could talk to me. She said she had something to tell me so we wen t outside and sat on the swing in the back yard. She told me her father had sexually abused her . I was shocked, stunned, sad, and couldn't believe what I was hearing. She also said, \"You and grandma also abused me. \" I started crying and thought, \"Where was I?\" I had no memory of any of this happening . I finally said to her, \"It's not that I don't believe you, it's just that I can't remember .\" But I was so naive when I got married right out of High School. I thought we were a normal, happy fami ly and this accusation shocked me to the roots. I thought and thought but could not remember a thin g. I do remember often saying when the kids were little that life seemed t o good to be true. Later she told me that I had abused all three of her children . I couldn't believe that I had done that, as I lov e those children like my own. I was heartsick and k ept praying it was not true. She gave me a booklet from Los Angeles Women's Task Force on Ritual Abuse, an d wouldn't let me see her children anymore. I could h ardly function. I was heartsick, like in a trance. As my daughter told me more about the abuse, I trie d so hard to remember, but couldn't. In going over her allegations and remembering her childhood, I though t there were times the abuse could have happened. B ut she appeared to be a normal, happy little girl. She was such a good little girl, obedient, loving and just a little angel. Sometime in the late 80's my daughter told me her father had sexually moleste d her from the time she was a baby . After Sue continued to tell me more, I began to bel ieve her and that this really happened. I could har dly stand to look at my husband or take care of him any longer b ut he was a sick old, helpless man so I continued t o care for him, every second hating him. But no matter what ha ppened, he never complained. Shortly after this she came to confront her father. She told him he had sexually abused her. He had a very hard, angry look as he looked at me and said, \"Your daugh ter is crazy.\" She left and we didn't see her for a very long time. I would call but she wouldn't answer the phon e or talk to me. "},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"My husband continued to be a very sick man and had to be taken care of. From then on, I only spoke to him when I had to. To think he had abused our daughter made me hate him. I had loved him for over 50 years. Now I couldn't even let him touch me at night. If he happened to p ut his leg or arm across me, I'd kick him. After my daughter's two accidents that both happene d on April 12th, two years apart, my daughter disap peared . I didn't know where she was. I was so afraid for her. She had not spoken to me for many months. It was l ike losing my arm. We were, I thought, so close and now she wa nted nothing to do with me. I felt like it was a dr eam or a terrible nightmare that I'd wake up from in the mor ning and it wouldn't be true. I was so worried abou t her. Without talking and praying to God, I never would have gott en through that separation from her. I felt like I was going crazy, so I went to a thera pist. The therapist did not seem to be helping me. After Sue fled from California, she called me and told me she was running for her life. One day I told my therapist t hat I had sent Sue money to help her write the book she explained she was needing to write to stay alive. The therapist surprised me when she said emphatically, \"Don't give her any more money .\" I told this therapist, \"God told me to help my daug hter .\" That's when I stopped going to her . Sue was my daughter and my heart said to help her. In spite of the abus e allegations, her father kept saying to me, \"Help her, Honey. Hel p her .\" I continued caring for my husband; he was helple ss and couldn't do anything for himself. I gritted my teeth and helped him, all the while hating him. He never ment ioned the abuse again. I got a call one day from my daughter. I was elated to hear from her. She was in Hawaii and she wanted me to know that she was going to be hit by this hurricane and didn't know what would happen to her. Later on the news, they showed the island of Kauai damage from Hurricane In niki. It was in ruins. I tried to call her but all lines of communication were down. Finally after a few days, she called to say she was alright, but lost everyth ing she had. When she came back to the states she called and tol d me more about her abuse. I was so confused but ev en though I could not remember anything, I began to believe it was all true. She moved from place to place to stay alive and finally called and said she was safe, but wouldn't tell me where she was. I felt so relieved that she was safe and getting help. First it's My Daughter, Then My Granddaughter Then her teenage daughter started having problems. Without any apparent reason, she tried to commit su icide three separate times . She is such a sweet, loving girl. I could hardly let myself think of her being sexually abused. And if I had abused her, I shouldn't be allowed to live. We talked but my granddaughter couldn't seem to tell m e why she had made those attempts. She finally decided to go live with her mother. She had only three months of school here in California until she graduated. We thought she c ould finish her school there. She was okay for awhi le with her mother and then she started being dysfunctional and finally became catatonic. My daughter was frantic. She couldn't handle her, as Sue is much smaller in stature and n ot as physically strong as my granddaughter is. She called and told me she was taking her to the hospital. She did n't know what else to do. My granddaughter was in the hospital a very short t ime when somehow she was able to call her father. S he told him she was being held against her will and would he pl ease come get her. He did fly there and get her. Bu t, instead of taking her to their home where she thought she woul d be going, he explained to her that she needed hel p and he was taking her to a halfway house, a place that other t eenagers who needed help lived. She shared a room w ith a teenage girl who also had problems. They had a lot of rules . She began functioning, taking care of herself, an d doing her chores. She often just went to bed and slept. I sta rted picking her up on Sundays. We would eat, shop, or take a ride. She was always so happy to see me. I called her alm ost every day; she would call me, too, not for anyt hing in particular, just to talk. I asked her one time how she felt when she thought she was going home with h er dad and found out she was really going to a halfway house. She said she felt abandoned. Her mother suggested that EEG Biofeedback might hel p her, so every Thursday, I'd pick her up and take her. She loved frozen yogurt so we'd always stop for that. W e'd talk and she always said she hated where she wa s living. She was able to finish her high school course. They tau ght her how to take the bus, so one day she enrolle d at Pierce Junior College to take a psychology class. She had only 10 days to finish the class when she called he r Mom and"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"said she couldn't stand it there at the home anymor e. Together my daughter and I got her a ticket, tha t was a Saturday and she was to leave on Monday. Saturday n ight her father picked her up and tried to talk her out of going, but she stood firm and said she was going. She was so scared to go alone. She kept saying, \"What if I can't find the gate I'm suppose to go to?\" I told her to go to the counter and tell them, \"I need help.\" I called the day of her flight to be sure the shuttle had picked her up. I prayed all day that God would watch over her and keep her safe. She arrived safely and my daughter was there to meet he r and take her home. She was okay for awhile then s tarted staring off again as if she were in a trance and di dn't seem aware of anything going on around her. I feel so helpless, I want to help her but I don't know how. Her brothers and I went for a visit with her and he r mother. She would be fine one minute and then she would sta rt staring and not talking, then she'd be okay again. When I think about my granddaughter and all she is going through I can hardly bear it. Such a waste of a young, lovi ng, life and what a horrible thing that she has to suffer and go through all the pain. These are things that should not happen to anyone. My daughter is now healed and is doing everything she can to help and heal her daughter. I pray constantly that my granddaughter can be heale d and lead a normal life. I am so proud of both of them. My husband was a man who had been severely physical ly, sexually, and verbally abused as a child . I loved him and trusted him. He was so loving and sweet sometimes a nd other times he would be so nasty and mean. He wa s like two different people. I know now he suffered from M ultiple Personality Disorder. He dearly loved his family. He was very proud of hi s two sons and dearly loved his little girl. I was not aware at the time that he was sexually abusing our daughter. By 1990 I was physically unable to take care of him. H e was in a wheelchair and had to be lifted many times during t he day. I found a nice board and care for him and, although I hadn't seen my oldest son in years, I called and as ked if he would come and morally support me while I told my husband about the move. He said, \"Okay, what have I got to lose.\" He came and explained to his dad how I couldn't physically take care of him and had found a nice pl ace for him. My husband said, \"Okay, if that's what you want to do with me.\" At that time I was seeing all of my kids, but alway s separately. I couldn't speak about any of them to the one I was seeing. It was hell. When I would call my oldest so n's wife, she was very cool. Finally she called and started questioning me about Sue's sexual abuse. I told her , \"I don't remember anything, but I believe her.\" S he said, \"How could you believe your daughter and still take care of your husband?\" I was shocked. I told her he was a sick, old, helpl ess man, what did she want me to do with him? She c alled later and asked how I could see my younger son after all the things he had done and I told her, \"I guess I h ave unconditional love for my children.\" Her reply was, \"Not me, my kids have to earn my love and they hav e.\" After that my oldest son and daughter-in-law wanted nothi ng more to do with me. I was not to call, send birt hday cards or presents of any kind. I once asked my oldest son if he had forgiven his father for firing him. He said , \"In my head I have, but in my heart I haven't.\" My husband died alone in a rest home in April of 19 96. I notified my children. The only thing the olde st boy said was, \"I'm sorry to hear that.\" My husband was crema ted and there was no service. My family is ruined. Not one of my children speaks to the other. I have ten grandch ildren and three great-grandchildren. I dream somet imes of us all sitting around the table on holidays and just enjoy ing each other and being a loving family, then I wa ke up to reality. This generational sexual abuse and mind control has ruined this family . It breaks my heart as it seems I can't help to stop this, only by supporting my daughter. I pray f or all my grandchildren's safety. Thank God, the tr uth about this abuse is finally coming out so other little childre n will be safe from it. In the last three years, I have thought so much abo ut my husband's abuse and have finally forgiven him . I hope he is at peace and looking down on us all, happy to see h is daughter working so hard to end this abuse for s o many children. Bettie Eckhart Sue's Mom "},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"A MOTHER'S SORROW: SUE FORD Turning the Tide The pain and loss of family locked into the bondage of mind control is more excruciating than losing t hem to physical death. I miss my family more than they cou ld ever imagine, in truth, more than I could have e ver imagined. I will never be able to replace my husband, or the life I thought we were living. I just wished he had chosen to heal with me. Why didn't he? Or is it really, why couldn 't he? Whatever it is or was, he didn't or couldn't , and so I have gone ahead and forged a path for freedom and sweet release for my children and myself, and have lighte d a path for others if they choose. Perhaps my husband was never consciously able to know that we were programmed t ogether and never really had a chance to comprehend who we really were independently or as a couple, but I fee l sure that I knew his spirit. In truth, he was the most gentle, loving and giving man I have ever known. I know why my daughter is having so much trouble coming out of a catatonic state, because it is so painful to deal w ith the reality that the very ones that you love and that love you are the ones that are programmed to hurt you so muc h. That is the nature of the evil system that has kept so many und er mind control bondage. But, the truth is that all of us were programmed by a source outside of ourselves, at bir th; a time when none of us were able to change any of the horrendous circumstances we faced. To have had this seemingly beautiful family and the n to wake up to reality only to find that it wasn't beautiful, that instead our lives were interlaced with terror, abus ive horrors, and atrocity; nothing was as it seemed . To wake and find that I wasn't safe, and then to retrieve the a gonizing memories that led to discovering that my c hildren were not safe, was harrowing. And then to deal with the fact that my husband, the father of my children, was pr ogrammed to drug, rape and deliver us, was as painful, if not m ore painful than my father doing the same to me. I find myself curled into a fetal position on the floor more nigh ts than I care to think about, crying out in desper ation and in a pain that never seems to go away, a pain that really nev er lessens. The pain is a great burden and yet I fi nd that to carry it is to feel what is real. And, with that, I feel the great love and strength that has carried me this f ar. Like my daughter, I want my family back. I want the love that we all thought was there. I want everyon e healed. I want especially for my children to be freed and rel eased. If I had to give my life for that, I would i ndeed feel that it was spent wisely. I pray daily that God will carry me to make whatever contribution I can, and that He will light the path for my children's freedom. Indeed, for the fre edom of all those who suffer. I have never felt so uncertain about the future. I have given up the hope that any of the wrong's will be righted overnight. I never could have left, in my attempt t o save my life and heal in order to get help for my family, had I known that it would have taken this many years and that my family would still not be free. Still under mind control, and not yet recovered enough to have the full memor ies that made the picture of our high level slavery more complete, I naively thought that I could get my chi ldren out of danger and into safety and healing muc h quicker. I never thought that it would take this many years to ignite public intervention and outcry - and then t o have my sweet, loving, gentle daughter Kelly left in a comp letely dysfunctional state, and my two sons in tota l disbelief and unable to hear anything I have to say to point thei r way to safety and freedom, due to their own progr amming. I will never again tell survivors that I live in pe ace and contentment, because I don't. I have been g iven the Grace of God that allows me to live in a somewhat dissociate d state of mind with the painful reality of all tha t has happened in the background as I presently live a somewhat su ccessful life. But it doesn't stop the pain. There are times when I want to pretend none of this is real, I want to esc ape into dissociation, right along with Kelly. I mi ss her. I miss Craig, I miss Kevin and Danny. God, I miss them all ! Please God, use me in my brokenness to help other s not have to hurt this much. I must be very dangerous to the architects of this evil system and my high level co ntrollers. For I am a woman who loves God and her family more than l ife itself, and will not bow down to fear. In many ways I am fearless for I have nothing left to loose. Everything precious to me has been taken away. Ever y bond that was sacred, has been tainted, and broke n. Birth, life, marriage, children; family relationships of f ather, mother, brother, husband, son, daughter, all tainted and destroyed. All that was before lies in ruins. Total and complete ruins. And what remains in the future is in your hands. For I have laid down the burden. I have spen t the past 14 years communicating what happened to me to as many persons possible.

The pain is so deep, so present, and so pervasive. My heart aches for the love lost, for the suffering endured, for the souls locked in bondage. Many nights I cry until th e tears won't come any longer.

If it were not for Jesus, I could not have endured . For He has put this appointment before me. When I was a child, and the torture that often took me near death was too much to bear, Jesus sent His angels to minister to me, to gently and lovingly gu ide me back to my body, so I could be here now to t ell you what has happened, so it can stop . And when as an adult I reached a point in my spirit ual healing that I could begin to put the terror as sociated with Him, created from satanic ritual abuse, aside, the Master Himself began appearing before me, leading m e, guiding me, and interceding when I was totally alone and in need. Believe me, Jesus is alive today. The Great Healer can heal anything, everything, we only need to ask .

Jesus has asked me to ask you to help. Please help me to help the o thers. They are so worthy and have suffered so much . More than anyone I know they deserve a gigantic measure of Ch rist love. Recently, as I watched the movie, Schindler's List , I could relate to his frantic desperation and har d work to rescue and save the lives of as many Jewish people as he c ould, finally selling his last possessions to do so . This man realized the precious value of a soul. Jesus calls us to give to those who are in need. Most victims of mind control and ritual abuse who are trying to break free, are forced to live in stark poverty and degradation; ph ysically, emotionally and spiritually . They need safety from further abuse and shelter fro m the cold; they need blankets, food and clothing.

"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Brice Taylor - Thanks for the Memories EPILOGUE A New Vision for the Future What initially began as journaling in order to sort out my mind, became more of a project once I began to break free and see that there was some insane organized plan b ehind the mysteries of my life. The singularity of my one voice has been lonely over the years, but there were mome nts when the good Lord caused my path to cross with at first one, and then two, and then whole groups full of be autiful but wounded persons who had been though sim ilar experiences. Together all of our voices, telling th e same truths, have gained strength over the years. And today I am not alone in my recovery, for I have many brothers and sisters all over the globe that have recovered to inform you of much the same grim picture that I have shared wi th you here. I have spent the last 14 years cataloging this information, and am now able to report to you what has been going on behind the scenes so that the tru th might set us all free . God only knows the full ramifications of what has occurred, but this information that I have present ed to you in the clearest manner I know how, will give yo u a glimpse of the plans and agenda of those who at the present time are not only pulling the purse strings, but ar e manipulating the very life force of the nation an d ultimately of the world. We find ourselves at a time when, in order to survi ve and insure that our freedoms are reinstated, we must take action. It no longer serves us as a nation and as a world to turn a deaf ear to what has occurred. The se actions taken by those whose consciousness is dwarfed by the beli ef in power and control have, in actuality, called us to a new time of choice. We stand at the crossroads of a new era, indeed a new millenium. And now it is truly o ur choice as to where to go from here. Will we continue to be un involved, feeling that the chaos, created intention ally to confuse and disrupt, has caused our world to seem so unbala nced and turbulent that we feel we don't know how t o choose, that we don't know which way to turn? Or will we se e clearly though the chaos and confusion, and rise above their smokescreen attempts to hide their New World Order plan to enslave the human race, so we can create an other option? We do have many choices. As a matter of fact, what these controllers have le d us to is a clear view of what needs attending to anyway, in our technologically advancing world. Armed with the inf ormation of what is askew, we can now right the wro ngs and clearly envision what could be. The lives of our ch ildren and future generations depend upon the choic es we make at this pivotal juncture. We can create a new world . We can create a new reality to include freedoms not yet known to this planet . We can create new institutions , new ways of ordering society with God's leading and God's guiding . Many clamor for lives filled with more time: time t o rest, to enjoy nature, to spend with family and f riends in simple modes of comradery, time to reflect and time to com e closer to God and our higher nature. These can al l be part of a new reality we create together, as God's people. Bu t we have to realize that to make the choice to sta nd silent is to let those whose belief in power and control of the masses, take control in order to enslave us all. Th ey led us to this point in time where we are nearly out of time. God has called me to sound the wake up call as I jo in with others around the nation and the world who are sounding the same alarm. We must wake up and we must act. Th is is a call to action in order to avert the culmin ation of their New World Order plan . Never was there more critical time than now for sta nding for what we believe in , un- intimidated by disconnected, unhealed beings who ar e bullying us around on this beautiful planet of ou rs, taking control where we have neglected to maintain our vig ilance. The technology that has been created has be en used in an evil way, causing harm and separation among and between individuals, families, groups, and from God , indeed from the higher nature of our inner being. We can c ontinue to allow our university medical research, m ilitary, and space programs to be filled with an alternate secre t agenda, or we can call into account those working within secret systems that have allowed these mind control atroci ties to operate behind protected walls, as those wh o participate at the highest levels go unpoliced and undetected. The Holy Spirit has shown me that once you have completed this boo k and the veil that once clouded your eyes has been lifted , many will know how they are called to bring about t he swift change necessary for averting the One World Government and the intended totalitarian New World Order agenda planned by our controllers . He has shown me that many will know their exact positions and will know just what part they are to play in re uniting this"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"once strong, free nation. Indeed the vision I see i s a beautiful orchestration of souls. May God bless those individuals with the courage, wisdom, insight, and love needed to set us back on course.

Let us stand as a united front to speak out and t ake action to protect one of the most precious gifts we each have : our minds. We must stand up to those who seek con trol and say, \"NO MORE. THIS ABUSE MUST STOP !\" It is time to cast our denial aside and take act ion as we are spiritually directed. For we have been called to pr otect the children. Please join me in united solidarity. Let's create a safer, beautiful world where childre n can be born into peace , safety, and love. If we start at the beginning wher e life initiates and insure that doorway is clear, we will go a long way toward insuring the survival of the human race. Many are now more aware of the damage done to a ba by or young child when abuse occurs. Indeed this unconsci ous state of the abuse of children continues to sno wball as one generation takes the wounding, only to inflict it u nconsciously, without knowledge or understanding, o n the next generation. Let us heal these areas within us that were caused by abuse in our own childhood's , so that we do not continue to inflict those wounds on the most precio us resource we have, our innocent children . Let us protect the doorway for others born to this planet, that they m ight discover that it is safe to be born here on ea rth once again. Together we can let love prevail. The past has serv ed to clearly show us where we have gone astray. Le t's begin again, by choosing a different outcome and then wor k together in order to create a new world. We need the strongest, most courageous among us to stand and call into account those individuals and g roups who have participated in this atrocity; their version o f this 'Utopian Hell,' in order to stop this abuse of children . We need individuals to initiate laws and measures that will not only insure freedom of the mind, but other ver y fundamental freedoms taken for granted, that we now stand to lo ose . The course of our actions now will determine the fu ture. What will we choose, fear or love? And now as my job of exposing the deeds and plans o f those who worship power and control comes to a cl ose, I am once again redirected to my job of helping the vict ims heal. God has commissioned me to stand at the d oorway, to accept donations in whatever way they flow to me as fiduciary for others who have been abused in simil ar ways and to set about busily setting up safe healing centers for victims to seek aid if they choose. The quanti ty and magnitude of these centers is up to you, for my job is to be there, and your job, if so called, is to help fund it. Many have been wounded and are needing our help. The Holy Spirit t hat guides me has shown me that the outpouring of g enerosity, in whatever form, can alleviate much of the sufferi ng and help to avert even much of the earth calamit ies and chaos, for the outpouring of love for fellow humanity heal s the mass consciousness on the planet. As we unite around the world in prayer and action we create a very powerfu l vibration of love; a frequency that unlocks and h eals the hearts of those who have yet to learn the awesome power of Christ love. We stand at the crossroads to a very important time of choice, action, and giving. Instead of a One-World Government we can create a One-World Healing . Please help the young and the wounded among us wh o depend on our strength and courage to show them a better d ay. Please give what you can to insure that this ab use stops and insure the victims a means of healing. They are cou nting on us. Don't miss the call.

You may wonder how you f it into this picture ...are you, too, under mind co ntrol? Let me share with you the following inspiration from a sur vivor of mind control who discovered that her own e xperiences paralleled, even at times interwove, with those pre sented in this book: A Survivor's Experience \"I, too, have a story. Some of the details are all too similar to Sue's. Much I don't yet remember. Wh at I do know is that ten years ago, I began having memories of abuse ...first by my unc le, then my father, then floods of memories of Satanic and ritual abuse . This is where I stalled, if you will, for five ye ars. I believed during that time that I was free from my captors, as long as I kept my distance . And I went about rebuilding a life for myself, carefull y controlling my environment so that I wouldn't be tr iggered by \"my past\" any more than I could handle . I thought I was being a really good mom, and wife, and friend. And yet, I continued to be tormented by nightmares, memories, feelings of agitation, anger, rage, and depression. Deep inside of me, I knew that I wasn't free. And yet, I still believed that I was re-experiencing the past. Now w hat I know is that I was still involved, unconsciously triggered even to return to satanic rituals while the abuse c ontinued and, under mind control, I was still carry ing out the wishes of those attempting to bring in the \" New World Order .\" Now I have seen what I could not see before - a \"reality\" that is being carried out by some misguid ed souls on earth at this time. Through the help of EEG Neuro-feedback, I have been able to reclaim my mind, for my own use. I am awar e of what a gift it is to have the use of some of the sa me technology that was previously used to control m e, to now set me free. I am finding that EEG Neuro-feedback is he lping me to integrate quickly, as I learn to stay a lert and attentive and not dissociate. I am also learning to keep myself safe by discovering the ways that othe rs have been able to \"access\" me through programming. I would say that the major focus of these past five years has been strengthening my connection to God and learning to discern the different voices, or promptings, fro m within. How do I decide what to trust? Who or wha t is worthy of my trust? The key for me has been prayer. When I haven't known what to believe in, I have prayed to know. I have learned to trust that there is a God ...a Powe r greater than any that humans can wield on this pl anet. And so, I go directly to that Source. Those prayers continue to bring me the healing and the safety that I seek. Please join me and the many others who are committed to living our true purpose, and loving ourselves and each other into freedom.\" -- A Ritual Abuse and Mind Control Survivor "},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Brice Taylor - Thanks for the Memories SUGGESTED READING The following list of references is provided for in formation purposes only and does not necessarily re flect the opinion of this author nor represent an endorsement .
