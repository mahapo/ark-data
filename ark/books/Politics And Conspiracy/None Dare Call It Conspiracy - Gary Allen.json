Usually you are shown a landscape with trees, bu shes, flowers and o ther bits of nature. The caption reads s omething like this: \"Concea led somewhere in this picture is a donk ey pulling a cart with a boy in it. Can you find them?\" Try as you mi ght, usually y ou could no t find the hidden p icture until you turned to a page farther back in the magazine which would reveal how cleverly the a rtist had h idden it from us. If we study the landscape we realize that the whole picture was painted in such a way as to conceal the real picture within, and on ce we see the \"real picture,\" it stands out li ke the proverbial painful digit. We believe the picture painters of the mass media a re artfully creating landscapes for us which d eliberately hide the real picture. In this book we will show you how to discover the \"hidden p icture\" in the landscapes presented to u s daily through newspapers, radio and television. Once you can see through the ca mouflage, you will see the donk ey, the c art and the boy who have been there a ll along. Milli ons of Americans are c oncerned and frustrated ov er mi shappenings in ou r nation. They feel that something is wrong, drastically wrong, bu t because of the picture painters they can't quite put their fingers on it. Maybe you are one of tho se persons. Something is bug ging you, bu t you aren't sure what. We keep electing new Presidents who seemi ngly promi se faithfully to h alt t he world-wide Comm unist advance, pu t the blocks to extravagant government spending, dou se the fires of inflation, pu t the ec ono my on an even k eel, reverse the trend which is turning the c oun try into a moral sewer, and toss the c rimi nals into the hoo segow where they belong. Yet, d espite high hop es and glittering campaign p romi ses, these problems continue to worsen no matter who is in o ffice. Each n ew admi nistration, whether it be Repub lican or Democrat, continues the same basic policies of the previous admi nistration which it had so thoroughly denou nced d uring the election campaign. It is considered poo r form t o mention this, bu t it i s true non etheless. Is there a plausible reason to explain why this happens? We a re not suppo sed to think so. We a re suppo sed to think it i s all acc idental and coincidental and that therefore there is nothing we can do about it . FDR once said \"In po liti cs, no thing happens by accident. If it happens, you can b et it was planned that way.\" He was in a good po sition to kno w. We believe that m any of the major world events that are shaping our destinies occur because somebod y or somebod ies have planned them t hat way.

When you think abou t it , there a re really only two theories of history. Either things happen by acc ident neither planned no r caused by anybody, or they happen b eca use they are planned and somebody causes them t o happen. In reality, it i s the \"acc idental theory of history\" preac hed in the unhallowed Halls of Ivy which shou ld b e ridiculed. Otherwise, why does every recent admi nistration make the same mi stakes as the previous ones? Why do they repeat the errors of the past which produ ce inflation, d epressions and war? Why does our State Departm ent \"stumble\" from one Comm unist-aiding \"blund er\" to another? If you believe it i s all an accident or the result of mysterious and un explainable tides of history, you will be regarded as an \"intellectual\" who und erstands that we live in a complex world. If you believe that something like 32,496 consecutive c oincidences over the past forty y ears s tretches the law of averages a bit, you are a kook ! Why is it t hat virtually all \"reputable\" scholars and mass media c olumnists and comm entators reject the c ause a nd effect or conspiratorial theory of history? Prim arily, most scholars follow the c rowd in the academi c world just as most women follow fashions. To bu ck the tide means s ocial and p rofessional ostracism. The same is true of the mass media. While professors and p ontificators profess to b e tolerant and b roadmi nded, in p ractice it's s trictly a one way street-with all t raffic flowing left. A Maoist can b e tolerated by Liberals of Ivory Towerland o r by the Establishment's media pund its, bu t to b e a c onservative, and a c onservative who propound s a conspiratorial view, is absolutely verboten. Better you shou ld b e a drunk at a national WCTU conv ention! Second ly, these people have over the years acquired a strong vested emotional interest in their own errors. Their intellects and egos are totally committ ed to the a ccidental theory. Most people a re highly reluctant to admit t hat they have been conned o r have shown poo r judgment. To inspect the e vidence of the e xistence of a c onspiracy guiding our politi cal destiny from behind the scenes would force many of these people to repud iate a lifetim e of acc umulated op inions. It takes a person with strong character indeed to face the facts and admit he has been wrong even if it was beca use he was uninformed. Such was the case with the a uthor of this book. It was only because he set out to p rove the c onservative a nti-Comm unists wrong that he happened to end up writing this book. His initial reac tion to the c onservative point of view w as one of suspicion and hostili ty; and it was only after many months of intensive research that he had to admit that he had b een \"conn ed.\" Politi cians and \"intellectuals\" are a ttracted to the c oncept that events are propelled by some mysterious tide of history or happen by accident. By this reasoning they hope to escape the blame when things go wrong."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Most intellectuals, pseudo and o therwise, deal with the c onspiratorial theory of history sim ply by ignoring it. They never attempt to refute the e vidence. It can't be refuted. If and when the silent treatm ent doesn't work, these \"objective\" scholars and mass media opinion molders resort to p ersonal attacks, ridicule a nd satire. The personal attacks tend to d ivert attention from t he facts which an author or speaker is trying to expose. The idea is to force the person exposing the c onspiracy to stop the exposure a nd spend h is tim e a nd effort defending him self. However, the most effective weapon s used against the c onspiratorial theory of history are ridicule a nd satire. These e xtremely potent weapon s can b e c leverly used to avoid any honest attempt at refuting the facts. After all, nobo dy likes to b e made fun o f. Rather than b e ridiculed most people will keep qu iet; and, this s ubject certainly does lend itself to ridicule a nd satire. One technique which ca n b e used is to expand the conspiracy to the e xtent it becomes absurd. For instance, ou r man from t he Halls of Poison Ivy mi ght say in a scoffingly arrogant tone, \"I suppo se you believe every liberal professor gets a telegram each morning from conspiracy headqu arters containing his orders for the day's brainwashing of his s tudents?\" Some conspiratorialists do indeed ov erdraw the picture by expanding the c onspiracy (from the small clique which it i s) to include e very local knee-jerk liberal activist and government bureaucrat. Or, because of racial or religious bigotry, they will take small fragments of legitim ate evidence a nd expand them i nto a c onclusion that will suppo rt their particular prejudice, i.e., the c onspiracy is totally \"Jewish,\" \" Catholic,\" or \"Masonic.\" These people do no t help to expose the c onspiracy, bu t, sadly play into the hands of those who want the pub lic to b elieve that all conspiratorialists are screwballs. \"Intellectuals\" are fond of mouthing clichés like \"The c onspiracy theory is often tempting. However, it i s overly sim plistic.\" To ascribe a bsolutely everything that happens to the machinations of a small group o f power hungry conspirators is overly sim plistic. But, in ou r opinion no thing is more sim plistic than dog gedly holding onto the acc idental view of major world events. In most cases Liberals s im ply accuse a ll t hose who d iscuss the c onspiracy of being paranoid. \"Ah, you right wingers,\" they say, \"rustling every bush, k icking over every rock, look ing for im aginary boogeymen.\" Then comes the c oup d e grace-labeling the conspiratorial theory as the \"devil t heory of history.\" The Liberals love that one. Even thou gh it i s an empty phrase, it sound s s o soph isticated! With the leaders of the academi c a nd comm unications world assumi ng this sneering attit ude towards the c onspiratorial (or cause a nd effect) theory of history, it is not surprising that milli ons of inno cent and well-meaning people, in a natural desire not to appear naive, assume the attit udes and repeat the clichés of the opinion makers. These persons, in their attempt to appear soph isticated, assume their mentors' air of smug superiority even though they themselves have not spent five mi nutes in study on the subject of international conspiracy. The \"acc identalists\" would h ave us believe that ascribing any of our problems to planning is 'sim plistic\" and all our problems are caused by Poverty, Igno rance a nd Disease--hereinafter abbreviated as FID.

It is not true, ho wever, to state that there a re no members of the intellectual elite who subscribe to the c onspiratorial theory of history. For example, there is Professor Carroll Quigley of the Foreign Service Schoo l at Georgetown University. Professor Quigley can h ardly be accused o f being a \"right wing extremi st.\" (Those three words have been made inseparable by the mass media.) Dr. Quigley has all t he \"liberal\" credentials, having taught at the Liberal Establishment's academi c Mecca's of Princeton and Harvard. In h is 1300 -page, 8 poun d tome Tragedy and Hope, Dr, Quigley reveals the e xistence of the c onspiratorial network which will be discussed in this book. The Professor is not m erely formulating a theory, bu t revealing this network's existence from firsthand experience. He also makes it clear that it i s only the network's s ecrecy and no t their goals to which he objects. Professor Quigley discloses: \"I kno w of the operations of this network b ecause I have studied it for twenty years and was permitt ed for two years, in the early 196 0's, to exami ne its papers and secret records. I HAV E NO A VERSION TO IT OR TO MOST OF ITS AIMS AND HAV E, FOR MUCH O F MY LIFE, BEE N CLOSE T O IT AND TO MANY OF ITS INSTRUMENTS. I have objected, bo th in the past and recently, to a few of its policies ... bu t in general my chief difference of opinion is that IT WISHES TO REMAIN UNK NOWN, and I believe its role in h istory is s ignificant enough to b e kno wn.\" (Emphasis added) We a gree, its role in h istory does deserve to b e known. That is why we have written this book. However, we most emphatically disagree with this network's aim which the Professor describes as \"nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in p rivate hands able to domi nate the politi cal system of each coun try and the econo my of the world as a whole.\" In o ther words, this power mad clique wants to control and rule the world. Even more-frightening, they want total control over all individual actions. As Professor Quigley observes: \"... h is [the individual's] freedom and choice will be c ontrolled within v ery narrow alternatives by the fact that he will be numbered from birth and followed, as a number, through h is educational training, his required milit ary or other pub lic service, his tax contributions, his health and medical requirements, and h is final retirement and death b enefits.\" It wants control over all natural resources, bu siness, banking and transportation by controlling the governments of the world. In order to acc omplish these a im s the c onspirators have had no qu alm s abou t fomenting wars, depressions and h atred. They want a monopo ly which would elimi nate a ll competitors and d estroy the free e nterprise system. And Professor Quigley, of Harvard, Princeton and Georgetown approves! Professor Quigley is not the only aca demi c who is aware of the e xistence of a c lique of serf-perpetuating conspirators whom we shall call Insiders.

The a uthor kno ws these men exist beca use he has been in contact with some of them. There a re a lso religious leaders who are a ware of the e xistence of this conspiracy. In a UPI story dated December 27, 1965, Father Pedro Arrupe, head o f the Jesuit Order of the Roman Catholic Church, made the following charges during his remarks to the Ecumenical Coun cil: \"This .. . Godless s ociety operates in an extremely efficient m anner at least in its higher levels of leadership. It m akes use of every possible means at it s disposal, be they scientific, technical, social or econo mi c. It follows a perfectly mapped-out strategy. It holds alm ost complete sway in international organizations, in financial circles, in the field of mass comm unications; press, cinema, radio and television. \" There a re a number of problems to b e overcome in conv incing a person of the possible e xistence of a c onspiratorial clique of Insiders who from t he very highest levels manipulate government policy. In this case truth is really stranger than fiction. We a re dealing with h istory's greatest \"whodun it,\" a mystery thriller which pu ts Erie Stanley Gardner to shame. If you love a mystery, you 'll be fascinated with the study of the operations of the Insiders. If you do study this network o f which Professor Quigley speaks, you will find that what had at first seemed incredible not only exists, but heavily influences our lives. It m ust be remembered that the first job o f any conspiracy, whether it be in politi cs, crim e or within a business office, is to conv ince e veryone e lse that no conspiracy exists. The c onspirators s ucce ss will be determi ned largely by their ability to do this. That the e lite of the academi c world and mass comm unications media a lways poo h- pooh the e xistence of the Insiders merely serves to camouflage their op erations. These \"artists\" hide the boy, the cart and the don key. Probably at some tim e you h ave been invo lved with o r had p ersonal kno wledge of some e vent which was reported in the news. Perhaps it concerned an athletic e vent, an election, a c ommitt ee or your business. Did the report contain the \"real\" story, the story behind the story? Probably not. And for a variety of reasons. The reporter had tim e a nd space problems and there is a good chance the persons invo lved d eliberately did no t reveal all t he facts. Possibly the reporter's own p rejudices governed what facts went into the story and which were deleted. Our point is that m ost people know from personal experience that a news s tory often is not the whole story. But m any of us assume that our own case is unique when really it is typical. What is true a bout the reporting of local events is equally as true a bou t the reporting of national and international events. Psychological problems are a lso invo lved in inducing people to look at the evidence concerning the Insiders. People a re usually comfortable with their old b eliefs and conceptions. When Columbus told p eople the world was a ball and no t a pancake, they were highly upset. They were being asked to reject their way of think ing of a lifetim e a nd adop t a whole new outlook. The \"intellectuals\" of the day scoffed at Columbus and p eople were a fraid they would lose social prestige if they listened to him . Many others just did no t want to b elieve the world was round. It complicated too many things. And typical flat-earthers had such a vested interest invo lving their own"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"egos, that they heaped abuse on Columbus for challenging their view of the universe. \"Don't confuse us with facts; our mi nds are made up, \" they said. These same factors apply today. Because the Establishment controls the media, anyone e xposing the Insiders will be the recipient of a c ontinuou s fusillade of invective from newspapers, magazines, TV and radio. In this manner one is threatened with loss of \"social respectability\" if he dares broach the idea that there is organization b ehind any of the problems currently wracking America. Unfortunately, for many people social status comes before intellectual hon esty. Althou gh they would never admit it , social position is more im portant to many people than is the survival of freedom i n America. If you ask these people which is more im portant- social respectability or saving their children from slavery -they will t ell you the latter, of course. But their actions (or lack of same) speak so much loud er than their words. People have a n infinite c apacity for rationalization when it comes to refusing to face the threat to America's s urvival. Deep do wn these people a re afraid they may be laughed at if they take a stand, o r may be denied an invitation to some social clim ber's cocktail party. Instead of getting mad at the Insiders, these people ac tually get angry at those who are trying to save the coun try by exposing the c onspirators. One thing which makes it so h ard for some socially mi nded p eople to assess the conspiratorial evidence objectively is that the c onspirators come from t he very highest social strata. They are immensely wealthy, highly educated and extremely cultured. Many of them have lifelong reputations for philanthropy. Nobo dy enjoys being put in the position o f acc using promi nent people of conspiring to enslave their fellow Americans, bu t the facts are inescapable. Many business and p rofessional people a xe particularly vulnerable to the \"don't jeopardize your social respectability\" pitch given by those who do n't want the c onspiracy exposed. The Insiders kno w that if the business and p rofessional comm unity will not take a stand to save the private enterprise system, the socialism t hrough which they intend to control the world will be inevitable. They believe that m ost business and p rofessional m en are too shallow and d ecadent, too status conscious, too tied up in the problems of their jobs and businesses to worry about what is going on in po liti cs. These men are told that it mi ght be bad for business or jeopardize their government contracts if they take a stand. They have been b ribed into silence with their own tax monies! We a re hop ing that the conspirators have underestim ated the c ourage a nd patriotism remaining in the American p eople. We feel there a re a sufficient number of you who are not m esmerized by the television set, who pu t God, fami ly and coun try abov e social status, who will band together to expose a nd d estroy the c onspiracy of the Insiders.

During his early career he sat in a cold garret and pou red onto p aper his ambitions to rule the world. We know that. Simil arly, we kno w that a man n amed Vladimi r Ilich Lenin also existed.

He wants to p rovide for his fami ly in sickness and in h ealth and to give his children a sound education. His ambition stops there. He has no d esire to exercise power over others, to conqu er other lands or peoples, to b e a king. He wants to mi nd h is own business and enjoy life.

And if these men h appen to b e billi onaires is it not possible that they would u se men like Hitler and Lenin as pawns to seize power for themselves? Indeed, d ifficult as this is to b elieve, such is the case.

Can you im agine how effective the defense of a football t eam would b e if the fron t four could no t agree with the linebackers who could no t agree with the c orner backs who could no t agree with the safety men who could no t agree with the a ssistant coaches who could not agree with the head coach as to what kind o f defense they shou ld pu t up against the offense being presented? The obv ious result would b e c haos. You could take a sand lot team and succe ssfully pit t hem against the Green Bay Packers if the Packers couldn't agree on what it i s they are opposing. That is academi c. The first principle in any encoun ter, whether it be football or war (hot or cold), is: Know your enemy. The American people do no t kno w their enemy. Consequently, it i s not strange a t all t hat for three deca des we have been watching one c oun try of the world after another fall behind the Comm unist curtain.

Even Life magazine believes in conspiracies like the Cosa Nostra where men conspire to make money through crim e. You may recall t hat Life did a series of articles on the testim ony of Joseph Valachi before the McClellan Committ ee several years ago. There a re some a spects of those revelations which are worth no ting. Most of us did no t kno w the organization was called Cosa Nostra. Until Valachi \"sang\" we a ll t hou ght it was named the Mafia. That is how littl e we knew abou t this group, despite the fact that it was a ce ntury old and h ad b een o perating in many coun tries with a self- perpetuating clique of leaders. We didn't even kno w it by its proper name. It is not possible a politi cal conspiracy might exist, waiting for a Joseph Valachi to testify? Is Dr. Carroll Quigley the Joseph Valachi of politi cal conspiracies? We see that everybody, even Life magazine, believes in some sort of conspiracy. The question is: Which is the more lethal form of conspiracy-crimi nal or politi ca l? And what is the difference between a member of the Cosa Nostra a nd a Comm unist, or more properly, an Insider conspirator? Men like Lucky Luciano who have scratched and clawed to the top o f the heap in o rganized crime must, of nece ssity, be diabolically brilli ant, cunning and absolutely ruthless.

We repeat FDR's s tatement: \" In politi cs, no thing happens by accident. If it happens, you can b et it was planned that way. In reality, Comm unism i s a tyranny planned by power seekers whose most effective weapon is the big lie. And if one takes all t he lies of Comm unism and bo ils them down, you will find they distill i nto two major lies out of which all others spring. They are: (1) Comm unism i s inevitable, and (2) Comm unism i s a movement of the downtrodd en masses rising up against exploiting bosses. Let us go back to ou r im aginary survey and analyze our first big lie of Comm unism- that it i s inevitable. You will reca ll t hat we a sked ou r interviewee if he was for or against Comm unism and then we a sked him t o d efine it.

The answer, in alm ost every case will be simil ar to this: \"I'm no socialist, you understand, but I see what is going on in this coun try.

How effectively can you o ppose a nything if you feel your oppo sition is futile? Giving your oppo nent the idea that defending him self is futile is as old as warfare itself. In abou t 500 B.

How did Marx view Comm unism? How im portant is \"the inevitability of Comm unism\" to the Comm unists? W hat do the Comm unists want you to believe is inevitable-Comm unism or socialism? If you study Marx' Comm unist Manifesto you will find that in essence Marx said the proletarian revolution would establish the SOCIALIST dictatorship o f the proletariat. To achieve the SOCIALIST dictatorship o f the proletariat, three things would h ave to b e acc omplished: (1) The e limi nation o f all right to p rivate property; (2) The dissolution of the fami ly unit; and (3) Destruction o f what Marx referred to as the \"opiate of the people,\" religion. Marx went on to state that when the dictatorship o f the proletariat had accomplished these three things throughou t the world, and after some und etermi ned length o f tim e (as you can im agine, he was very vague on this point), the a ll powerful state would mi raculously wither away and state socialism would give way to Comm unism. You wouldn 't need any government at all. Everything would b e peace, sweetness and light and everybody would live happily ever after. But first, all Comm unists must work to establish SOCIALISM. Can't you just see Karl Marx really believing that an o mnipotent state would wither away? Or can you im agine that a Joseph Stalin (or any other man with the c unn ing and ruthlessness necessary to rise to the top o f the heap in an all-powerful dictatorship) would vo luntarily dismantle the power he had bu ilt by fear and terror? * ---- Footnote: {*} Karl Marx was hired b y a mysterious group who called themselves the League of Just Men to write the Comm unist Manifesto as demogogic boob -bait t o appeal to the mob. In actual fact the Comm unist Manifesto was in circulation for many years before Marx' name was widely enou gh recognized to establish h is authorship for this revolutionary handbook. All Karl Marx really did was to upd ate a nd codify the very same revolutionary plans and p rinciples s et down seventy y ears earlier by Adam Weishaup t, the found er of the Order of Illumi nati i n Bavaria. And, it i s widely ackno wledged by serious scholars of this s ubject that the League of Just Men was sim ply an extension o f the Illumi nati which was forced to go d eep und erground after it was exposed by a raid in 1786 condu cted by the Bavarian authorities. ---- Socialism would b e the bait ... the e xcuse to establish the dictatorship.

You really have to b e naive to swallow that, bu t milli ons do! The drive to establish SOCIALISM, no t Comm unism, is at the c ore of everything the Comm unists and the Insiders do.

The September 1970 issue of New Y ork magazine c ontains an article by Harvard Professor John Kenneth Galbraith, h im self a professed socialist, entitl ed \"Richard Nixon and the Great Socialist Revival.\" In d escribing what he calls the \"Nixon Game Plan,\" Galbraith states: \"Mr. Nixon is probably not a great reader of Marx, bu t [his advisors] Drs.

One e ncoun ters people who still aren't aware of it. Others must be rubb ing their eyes, for certainly the portents s eemed all t o the contrary. As and oppon ent of socialism, Mr. Nixon seemed steadfast. ...\" Galbraith then p rocee ds to list the giant steps toward socialism t aken by the Nixon Admi nistration. The c onclusion on e draws from t he a rticle is that socialism, whether it be from t he Democrat or Repub lican Parties, is inevitable. Fellow Harvard socialist Dr. Arthur Schlesinger has s aid much the same thing: \"The c hief liberal gains in the past generally remain on the statute book s when the conservatives recover power ... liberalism grows constantly more liberal, and by the same token, conservatism grows constantly less conservative....\" Many extremely patriotic individuals have inno cently fallen for the c onspiracy's line. Walter Trohan, columnist emeritus for the Chicago Tribun e a nd on e of America's outstanding politi cal commentators, has accurately noted: \"It is a kno wn fact that the policies of the government today, whether Republican o r Democratic, are c loser to the 1932 p latform of the Comm unist Party than they are to either of their own party platforms in that critical year. More than 100 years ago, in 1848 to b e e xact, Karl Marx promulgated h is program for the socialized state in the Comm unist Manifesto. .. .\" And Mr. Trohan has also been fed to believe that the trend is inevitable: \"Conservatives s hou ld b e realistic e nough to recognize that this coun try is going deeper into socialism and will see e xpansion o f federal power, whether Repub licans or Democrats are in po wer.

(See Chart 1) We a re told that on the far Left of the po liti cal spectrum we find Comm unism, which is admitt edly dictatorial. But, we a re a lso told that equally to b e feared is the oppo site of the far Left, i.e., the far Right, which is labeled Fascism.

There is an acc urate political spectrum. (See Chart 2.) Comm unism i s, by definition, total government. If you h ave total government it makes littl e diff erence whether you call it Comm unism, Fascism, Socialism, Caesarism or Pharaohism. It's all pretty much the same from t he standpoint of the people who must li ve a nd suffer under it. If total government (by any of its pseudo nyms) stands on the far Left, then by logic the far Right shou ld represent anarchy, or no government. Our Found ing Fathers revolted against the near- total government of the English monarchy. But they knew that having no government at all would lead to chaos. So they set up a Constitutional Repub lic with a very limit ed government. They knew that men p rospered in freedom. Althou gh the free e nterprise system i s not m entioned specifically in the Constitution, it i s the only one which can exist und er a Constitutional Repub lic. All collectivist systems require power in government which the Constitution d id n ot grant. Our Found ing Fathers had no intention o f allowing the government to b ecome an instrument to steal the fruit of one man's labor and give it t o another who had no t earned it. Our government was to b e one of severely limit ed powers. Thomas Jefferson said: \"In qu estions of power then let no more be heard o f confidence in man, bu t bind h im down from mi schief by the c hains of the Constitution. \" Jefferson kn ew that if the government were no t enslaved, people soon would b e. It was Jefferson's view that government governs best which governs least. Our forefathers established this coun try with the very least possible a moun t of government. Althou gh they lived in an age before a utomobiles, electric lights and television, they und erstood hu man n ature a nd its relation to po liti cal systems far better than do most Americans today. Tim es change, techno logy changes, bu t principles are eternal. Prim arily, government was to p rovide for national defense a nd to establish a court system. But we have burst the c hains that Jefferson spok e of and for many y ears now w e have been moving leftward across the political spectrum t oward collectivist total government. Every propo sal by our politi cal leaders (including some which are suppo sed to h ave the very oppo site effect, such as Nixon's revenue sharing propo sal) carries us further leftward to centralized government. This is not beca use socialism i s inevitable. It is no more inevitable than Pharaohism. It is largely the result of clever planning and patient gradualism. Since a ll Comm unists and their Insider bosses are waging a c onstant struggle for SOCIALISM, let us define that term. Socialism i s usually denned as government ownership and/or control over the basic means of produ ction and d istribution o f good s and services. When analyzed this means government control over everything, including you. All controls are \"people\" controls. If the government controls these areas it can eventually do just exactly as M arx set out to do -destroy the right to p rivate property, elimi nate the fami ly and wipe out religion. We a re being socialized in America a nd everybody kno ws it. If we had a chance to sit down and h ave a cup of coffee with the man in the street that we have been interviewing, he mi ght say: \"You kno w, the one thing I can n ever figure out is why all these very, very wealthy people like the Kennedys, the Fords, the Rockefellers and"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"others are for socialism. Why are the super-r ich for socialism? Don't they have the most to lose? I take a look at my bank accoun t and compare it with Nelson Rockefeller's and it seems funny that I'm against socialism and h e's out promoting it.\" Or is it funny? In reality, there is a vast difference between what the promoters define as s ocialism and what it i s in actual practice. The idea that socialism i s a share-the- wealth p rogram i s s trictly a c onfidence game to g et the people to surrender their freedom t o an all-powerful collectivist government. While the Insiders tell us we a re building a paradise on earth, we a re actually constructing a jail for ourselves. Doesn't it strike you as s trange that some of the individuals pushing hardest for socialism have their own p ersonal wealth p rotected in fami ly trusts and tax-fr ee found ations? Men like Rockefeller, Ford and Kennedy are for every socialist program kno wn to man which will i ncrease your taxes. Yet they pay-littl e, if anything, in taxes themselves. An article published by the North American Newspaper Alliance in August of 1967 tells how the Rockefellers pay practically no income taxes despite their vast wealth. The a rticle reveals that one of the Rockefellers paid the grand total of $685 p ersonal income tax during a recent year. The Kennedys have their Chicago Merchandise Mart, their mansions, yachts, planes, etc., all owned by their myriads of fami ly foun dations and trusts. Taxes are for peons! Yet hypocrites like Rockefeller, Ford and Kennedy pose as great champions of the \"downtrodden.\" If they were really concerned abou t the poor, rather than u sing socialism as a means of achieving personal politi cal power, they would d ivest themselves of their own fortunes. There is no law w hich p revents them from giving away their own fortunes to the poverty stricken. Shou ldn't these men set an example? And p ractice what they preach? If they advo cate sharing the wealth, shou ldn't they start with their own instead o f that of the mi ddle c lass which p ays alm ost all t he taxes? Why don't Nelson Rockefeller and Henry Ford II give a way all t heir wealth, retaining on ly enough to p lace themselves at the national average? Can't you im agine Teddy Kennedy giving up h is mansion, airplane a nd yacht and moving into a $25,000 h ome with a $20,000 mortgage like the rest of us? We a re usually told that this clique of super-rich are socialists because they have a guilt complex over wealth they inherited and d id no t earn. Again, they could relieve these suppo sed guilt complexes s im ply by divesting themselves of their unearned wealth. There a re doub tless many wealthy do -gooders who h ave been given a guilt complex b y their college professors, bu t that doesn't explain the ac tions of Insiders like the Rockefellers, Fords or Kennedys. All t heir actions betray them as power seekers. But the Kennedys, Rockefellers and their super-rich confederates are not being hypocrites in advo cating socialism. It appears to be a c ontradiction for the super-r ich to work for socialism and the destruction o f free enterprise. In reality it i s not. Our problem i s that m ost of us believe socialism is what the socialists want us to believe it i s-a share-thewealth p rogram. That is the theory. But is that how it works? Let us exami ne the only Socialist coun tries-according to the Socialist definition o f the word-extant in the world today. These are the Comm unist coun tries. The Comm unists themselves refer to these a s Socialist coun tries, as in the Union o f Soviet Socialist Repub lics.

Certainly even the most naive observe that Mr. Brezhnev do esn't li ve like one of the poo r peasants out on the great Russian steppes. But, acc ording to socialist theory, he is s uppo sed to do just that! If one und erstands that socialism i s not a share-thewealth p rogram, bu t is in reality a method to consolidate a nd control the wealth, then the seemi ng paradox of super-r ich men p romoting socialism becomes no p aradox at all. Instead it becomes the logical, even the perfect tool of power- seeking megalomaniacs. Comm unism, or more acc urately, socialism, is not a movement of the downtrodd en masses, bu t of the econo mi c e lite. The plan o f the c onspirator Insiders then is to socialize the United States, no t to Comm unize it. How is this to b e acc omplished? Chart 3 shows the structure of our government as established by our Foun ding Fathers. The Constitution fractionalized and subdivided governmental power in every way possible. The Found ing Fathers believed that eac h branch o f the government, whether at the federal, state or local level, would b e jealous of its powers and would n ever surrender them t o centralized control. Also, many phases of our lives (such as charity and education) were put totally, or alm ost totally, out of the grasp o f politi cians. Under this system you could no t have a dictatorship. No segment of government could po ssibly amass enou gh po wer to form a dictatorship. In order to have a dictatorship on e must have a single branch ho lding most of the reins of power. Once you have this, a dictatorship is inevitable. Chart 3 - Constitutional Repub lic A dictatorship was impossible in ou r Repub lic because power was widely diffused. Toda y, as we app roach Democratic Socialism, all power is being centralized a t the apex of the exec utive branch o f the federal government. This concentration o f power makes a d ictatorship inevitable. Those who control the President indirectly gain virtual control of the whole c oun try. The English ph ilosoph er Thomas Hobb es noted: \"Freedom i s government divided into small fragments.\" Wood -row Wilson, b efore he became the tool of the Insiders, observed: \"This history of liberty is a history of the limit ations of governmental power, no t the increase of it.\" And the English h istorian Lord Acton commented: \"Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" Even though these"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"men lived after our Constitution was written, ou r forefathers und erstood these principles completely. But what is happening today? As we move leftward along the politi cal spectrum towards s ocialism, all t he reins of power are being centralized in the e xecutive branch of the federal government. Much o f this is being done by buying with legislation o r with \"free\" federal grants all t he other entiti es. Money is used as bait and the hook is federal control. The Supreme Court has ruled, and in this case quite logically, that \"it is hardly lack o f due process for the government to regulate that which it subsidizes.\" If you and your clique wanted control ov er the United States, it would b e im possible to take over every city hall, coun ty seat and state house. You would want all power vested at the a pex of the e xecutive branch of the federal government; t hen you would have only to control one man to control the whole shebang. If you wanted to control the nation's manufacturing, comm erce, finance, transportation and n atural resources, you would n eed on ly to control the a pex, the power pinnacle, of an all-powerful SOCIALIST government. Then you would h ave a monopo ly and could squeeze out all your competitors. If you wanted a national m onopo ly, you must control a national socialist government. If you want a worldwide monopo ly, you must control a world socialist government. That is what the game is all abou t. \"Comm unism\" is not a movement of the downtrodd en masses but is a movement created, manipulated and used by power-seeking billi onaires in o rder to gain control over the world ... first by establishing socialist governments in the various nations and then consolidating them all t hrough a \"Great Merger,\" into an all-powerful world socialist super- state probably und er the a uspices of the United Nations.

To think o f writing a c omplete history of a nation covering even a year is absolutely incredible Not only is a historian's ability to write a n \"objective\" history limit ed by the sheer volume of happenings but by the fact that m any of the most im portant happenings never appear in the papers or even in somebody's memoirs.

If he does not have a \"theory,\" how does he separate im portant facts from unimportant ones? As Professor Stuart Crane has pointed ou t, this is why every book \"proves\" the a uthor's thesis. But no book is objective. No book can b e objective; and this book is not objective. (Liberal reviewers s hou ld have a ball quo ting that out of context.)

You h ave to stay and see the beginning of the film . Then as all t he piece s fall i nto p lace , the story makes s ense. This s ituation is very simil ar to the one in which milli ons of Americans find themselves today. They are c onfused by current happenings in the nation. They have come in as the movie, so to speak, is going into its conclusion. The earlier portion o f the mystery is needed to make the whole thing understandable. (Actually, we a re not really starting at the beginning, bu t we a re going back far enough to give meaning to today's happenings.) In order to un derstand the c onspiracy it i s nece ssary to h ave some rudim entary kno wledge of banking and, p articularly, of international bankers. While it would b e an ov er- sim plification to ascribe the e ntire c onspiracy to international bankers, they nevertheless have played a key role.

Where do governments get the e normous amoun ts of money they need? Most, of course, comes from t axation; but governments often spend more than they are willi ng to tax from t heir citizens and so are forced to bo rrow. Our national debt is now $455 billi on -every cent of it borrowed at interest from somewhere. The pub lic is led to b elieve that our government borrows from \"the people\" through savings bond s.

For centuries there has been b ig money to b e made by international bankers in the financing of governments and k ings. Such op erators are faced, ho wever, with certain thorny problems. We kno w that smaller banking operations protect themselves by taking collateral, bu t what kind o f collateral can you get from a government or a king? What if the banker comes to coll ect and the king says, \"Off with h is head\"? The process through which one c ollects a debt from a government or a monarch is not a subject taught in the business s choo ls of our universities, and most of us-never having been in the business of financing kings-have not given the problem m uch thou ght. But there is a king-f inancing business and to those who can ensure c ollection it i s lucrative indeed. Econo mi cs Professor Stuart Crane notes that there are two means used to collateralize loans to governments and k ings. Whenever a business firm borrows big money its creditor obtains a voice in management to p rotect his investm ent. Like a business, no government can b orrow big money unless willi ng to surrender to the c reditor some measure of sovereignty as collateral. Certainly international bankers who have loaned hund reds of billi ons of dollars to governments around the world comm and considerable influence in the policies of such governments. But the ultim ate a dvantage the c reditor has over the king or president is that if the ruler gets out of line the banker can finance his enemy or rival. Therefore, if you want to stay in the lucrative king-financing business, it i s wise to h ave a n enemy or rival waiting in the wings to unseat every king or president to whom you lend. If the king doesn't have a n enemy, you must create one. Preemi nent in p laying this game was the famous House of Rothschild. Its found er, Meyer Amschel Rothschild (1743 -1812 ) of Frankfurt, Germany, kept one of his five sons at home to run the Frankfurt bank and sent the others to London, Paris, Vienna and Naples. The Rothschilds beca me incredibly wealthy during the nineteenth century by financing g overnments to fight each o ther. According to Professor Stuart Crane: \"If you will l ook b ack at every war in Europe during the Nineteenth Century, you will see that they always ended with the e stablishment of a 'balance of power.' With every re-shuffling there was a balance of power in a new group ing around the House of Rothschild in England, France, or Austria. They group ed n ations s o that if any king"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"got out of line a war would b reak ou t and the war would b e decided by which way the financing went. Researching the debt positions of the warring nations will usually indicate who was to b e punished.\" In describing the c haracteristics of the Rothschilds and o ther major international bankers, Dr. Quigley tells us that they remained different from ordinary bankers in several ways: they were c osmopo litan and international; t hey were c lose to governments and were parti cularly concerned with government debts, including foreign government debts; these bankers came to b e ca lled \"international bankers.\" (Quigley, Tragedy and Hope, p. 52 ) One major reason for the historical blackou t on the role of the international bankers in politi cal history is that the Rothschilds were Jewish. Anti-Semit es have played into the hands of the c onspiracy by trying to po rtray the e ntire c onspiracy as Jewish. Nothing could b e farther fr om t he truth. The traditionally Anglo-Saxon J. P. Morgan and Rockefeller international banking institutions have played a key role in the conspiracy. But there is no d enying the im portance of the Rothschilds and their satellit es. However, it i s just as unreasonable a nd imm oral to b lame a ll Jews for the crim es of the Rothschilds as it i s to ho ld all Baptists acc oun table for the c rimes of the Rockefellers. The Jewish members of the c onspiracy have used an o rganization called the Anti- Defamation League a s an instrument to try to convince e veryone that any mention o f the Rothschilds or their allies is an attack on all Jews. In this way they have stifled alm ost all hon est scholarship on international bankers and made the subject taboo within un iversities. Any individual or book exploring this s ubject is imm ediately attacked by hund reds of A.D.L. committ ees all over the c oun try. The A.D.L. has never let truth o r logic interfere with its highly professional smear jobs. When no evidence is apparent, the A.D.L., which staunchly oppo sed so-called \"McCarthyism,\" accuses people of being \"latent anti-Semit es.\" Can you im agine how they would yowl and scream i f someone acc used them of being \"latent\" Comm unists? Actually, nobo dy has a right to b e more a ngry at the Rothschild clique than their fellow Jews. The Warburgs, part of the Rothschild empire, helped finance Adolph Hitler. There were few if any Rothschilds or Warburgs in the Nazi prison camps! They sat out the war in lux urious hotels in Paris or emi grated to the United States or England. As a group, Jews have suffered most at the hands of these power seekers. A Rothschild h as much more in comm on with a Rockefeller than h e does with a tailor from Budapest or the Bronx. Since the keystone of the international banking empires has been government bond s, it has been in the interest of these international bankers to encourage government debt. The higher the debt the more the interest. Nothing drives government deeply into d ebt li ke a war; and it has not been an un common p ractice a mong international bankers to finance both sides of the blood iest mili tary conflicts. For example, du ring our Civil War the North was financed by the Rothschilds through their American agent, August Belm ont, and the American South through the Erlangers, Rothschild relatives."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"But while wars and revolutions have been u seful to international bankers in gaining or increasing control over gov ernments, the key to such control has always been control of money. You can control a government if you have it i n your debt; a creditor is in a position to d emand the privileges of monopo ly from t he sovereign. Money-seeking governments have granted monopo lies in state banking, natural resources, oil concessions and transportation. However, the monopo ly which the international financiers most covet is control over a nation's money. Eventually these international bankers actually owned as private c orporations the central banks of the various European nations. The Bank o f England, Bank o f France and Bank of Germany were not owned by their respective governments, as alm ost everyone im agines, bu t were privately owned monopo lies granted by the heads of state, usually in return for loans. Under this system, ob served Reginald McKenna, President of the Midlands Bank o f England: \"Those that create a nd issue the money and credit direct the poli cies of government and h old in their hands the destiny of the people.\" Once the government is in d ebt to the bankers it i s at their mercy. A frightening example was cited by the London Financial Tim es of September 26, 1921, which revealed that even at that tim e: \"Half a dozen men at the top o f the Big Five Banks could up set the whole fabric of government finance by refraining from renewing Treasury Bills.\" All t hose who h ave sought dictatorial control over modern n ations have understood the nece ssity of a central bank. When the League of Just Men h ired a hack revolutionary named Karl Marx to write a blueprint for conqu est called The Comm unist Manifesto, the fifth p lank read: \"Centralization o f credit i n the hands of the state, by means of a national bank wit h state c apital and an exclusive monopo ly.\" Lenin later said that the establishment of a ce ntral bank was ninety percent of comm unizing a c oun try. Such conspirators knew that you canno t take c ontrol of a nation withou t mil itary force unless that nation h as a ce ntral bank through which you can control it s econo my. The a narchist Bakun in sarcastically remarked about the followers of Karl Marx: \"They have one foot in the bank and o ne foot in the socialist movement.\" The international financiers s et up their own front man in charge of each o f Europe's central banks. Professor Quigley reports: \"It m ust not be felt t hat these heads of the world's chief central banks were themselves substantive powers in world finance. They were not. Rather, they were the technicians and agents of the domi nant investm ent bankers of their own coun tries, who h ad raised them up and were perfectly capable of throwing them down. The substantive financial powers of the world were in the hands of these investm ent bankers (also called 'international' or 'merchants' bankers) who remained largely behind the scenes in their own un incorporated p rivate banks. These formed a system of international coop eration and national domi nance which was more private, more powerful, and more secret than that of their agents in the central banks. ... \" (Quigley, op. cit., pp. 326 -7.) Dr. Quigley also reveals that the international bankers who o wned and controlled the Banks of England and France maintained their power even after those Banks were theoretically socialized."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Naturally those who controlled the ce ntral banks of Europe were e ager fr om t he start to fasten a simil ar establishment on the United States. From t he earliest days, the Found ing Fathers had been conscious of attempts to control America through mon ey manipulation, and they carried on a runn ing battle with the international bankers. Thomas Jefferson wrote to John Adams: \"... I sincerely believe, with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armi es. ... \" But, even though America did no t have a central bank after President Jackson abolished it i n 1836, the European financiers and their American agents managed to obtain a great deal of control over our monetary system. Gustavus Myers, in Ms History of The Great American Fortunes, reveals: \"Under the surface, the Rothschilds long had a powerful influence in d ictating American financial laws. The law records s how that they were powers in the old Bank of the United States [abolished by Andrew Jackson].\" During the nineteenth century the leading financiers of the metropo litan East often cut one a nother's financial throats, bu t as their Western and rural victim s s tarted to organize politi cally, the \"robb er barons\" saw that they had a \"comm unity of interest\" toward which they must work together to p rotect themselves from t hou sands of irate farmers and up and comi ng competitors. This diffusion o f econo mi c power was one of the main factors s tim ulating the demands for a ce ntral bank by would-be business and financial m onopo lists. In Years of Plund er Proctor Hansl writes of this era: \"Among the Morgans, Kuhn -Loebs and o ther simil ar pillars of the indu strial order there was less disposition to b ecome invo lved in d isagreements that led to financial dislocation. A comm unity of interest came into b eing, with results that were highly beneficial. ...\" But aside from t he major Eastern centers, most American b ankers and their customers still distrusted the whole c oncept. In order to show the hinterlands that they were going to n eed a central hanking system, the international bankers created a series of panics as a demonstration o f their power-a warning of what would h appen un less the rest of the bankers got into line. The man in charge of condu cting these lessons was J. Pierpon t Morgan, American- born bu t educated in England and Germany. Morgan is referred to by many, including Congressman Louis M cFadden, (a banker who for ten years headed the House Banking and Currency Committ ee), as the top American agent of the English Rothschilds. By the turn o f the ce ntury J. P. Morgan was already an o ld hand at creating artificial panics. Such affairs were well co-ordinated. Senator Robert Ow en, a c o-author of the Federal Reserve Act, (who later deeply regretted his role), testified b efore a Congress ional Committ ee that the bank h e owned rece ived from t he National Bankers' Association what came to b e known as the \"Panic Circular of 1893.' It stated: \"You will at once retire one-third o f your circulation and call i n on e-half of your loans. ...\""},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Historian Frederick Lewis Allen tells in Life magazine of April 25, 1949, o f Morgan's role in spreading rumors abou t the insolvency of the Knickerbocker Bank and The Trust Company of America, which rumors triggered the 1907 p anic. In answer to the question: \"Did Morgan precipitate the panic?\" Allen reports: \"Oakleigh Thome, the president of that particular trust company, testified later before a c ongressional committ ee that his bank h ad b een subjected to on ly moderate withdrawals ... that he had no t applied for help, and that it was the [Morgan's] 'sore point' statement alone that had caused the run on his bank. From t his testim ony, plus the disciplinary measures taken by the Clearing House against the Heinze, Morse a nd Thomas banks, plus other fr agments of suppo sedly pertinent evidence, certain chroniclers have arrived at the ingenious conclusion that the Morgan interests took advantage of the unsettled cond itions during the autumn o f 1907 to p recipitate the panic, guiding it shrewdly as it progressed so that it would k ill off r ival banks and consolidate the preemi nence of the banks within the Morgan o rbit.\" The \"panic\" which Morgan h ad created, he proceeded to end alm ost single-handedly. He had made his point. Frederick Allen explains: \"The lesson of the Panic of 1907 was clear, though no t for some six years was it destined to b e e mbod ied in legislation: the United States gravely needed a central banking system. ...\" The man who was to p lay the most significant part in p roviding America with that central bank was Paul Warburg, who along with h is brother Felix had imm igrated to the United States from Germany in 1902. (See Chart 4.) They left brother Max (later a major financier of the Russian Revolution) at home in Frankfurt to run the fami ly bank (M. N. Warburg & Company). Paul Warburg married Nina Loeb, d aughter of Solomon Loeb of Kuhn, Loeb and Company, America's most powerful international banking firm. Brother Felix married Frieda Schiff, daughter of Jacob Schiff, the ruling power behind Kuhn, Loeb. Stephen Birmi ngham writes in h is authoritative Our Crowd: \"In the e ighteenth century the Schiffs and Rothschilds s hared a doub le hou se\" in Frankfurt. Schiff reportedly bought his partnership in Kuhn, Loeb with Rothschild money. Both Paul and Felix Warburg beca me partners in Kuhn, Loeb and Company. In 1907, the year of the Morgan-precipitated p anic, Paul Warburg began spending alm ost all of his tim e writing and lecturing on the need for \"bank reform.\" Kuhn, Loeb and Company was s ufficiently pub lic spirited abou t the matter to k eep h im on salary at $500,000 p er year while for the next six years he donated h is tim e to \"the pub lic good .\" Working with Warburg in p romoting this \"banking reform\" was Nelson Aldrich, kno wn as \"Morgan's floor broker in the Senate.\" Aldrich's daughter Abby married John D.

Althou gh h e had no technical kno wledge of banking, Aldrich and h is entourage spent nearly two years and $30 0,000 o f the taxpayers' money being wined and d ined by the owners of Europe's central banks as they toured the Continent \"studying\" central banking. When the Commi ssion returned from it s luxurious junk et it held no meetings and made no report for nearly two years. But Senator Aldrich was busy \"arranging\" things. Together with Paul Warburg and o ther international bankers, he staged on e of the most im portant secret m eetings in the history of the United States. Rockefeller agent Frank Vanderlip admitt ed many y ears later in h is memoirs: \"Despite my views abou t the value to society of greater pub licity for the a ffairs of corporations, there was an o cca sion, n ear the c lose of 1910, when I was as s ecretive- indeed as furtive-as any conspirator .... I do no t feel it i s any exaggeration to speak o f our secret expedition to Jekyl Island as the occasion o f the ac tual conception o f what eventually became the Federal Reserve System.\" The secrecy was well warranted. At stake was control over the e ntire ec onomy. Senator Aldrich h ad issued confidential invitations to Henry P. Davison o f J. P. Morgan & Company; Frank A. Vanderlip, President of the Rockefeller- owned National City Bank; A. Piatt Andrew, Assistant Secretary of the Trea sury; Benjami n Strong of Morgan's Bankers Trust Company; and Paul Warburg. They were a ll t o acc ompany him t o Jekyl Island, Georgia, to write the final recomm endations of the National Monetary Commi ssion report. At Jekyl Island, writes B. C. Forbes in h is Men Who Are Making America: \"After a general discussion it was decided to d raw up certain broad p rinciples on which all could agree. Every member of the group vo ted for a ce ntral bank as being the ideal cornerstone for any banking system.\" (Page 399) Warbu rg stressed that the name \"central bank\" must be a voided at all costs. It was decided to p romote the scheme a s a \"regional reserve\" system with four (later twelve) branches in d ifferent sections of the c oun try. The c onspirators knew that the New York b ank would do mi nate the rest, which would be marble \"white e lephants\" to dece ive the pub lic. Out of the Jekyl Island meeting came the c ompletion o f the Monetary Commi ssion Report and the Aldrich Bill.

However, Aldrich's name a ttached to the bill proved to b e the kiss of death, since a ny law bearing his name was s o obv iously a project of the international bankers. When the Aldrich Bill could no t be pushed through Congress, a new strategy had to be devised. The Repub lican Party was too closely conn ected with Wall Street. The only hop e for a ce ntral bank was to d isguise it and h ave it put through by the Democrats as a measure to strip Wall Street of its power. The opp ortunity to do this came with the a pproach o f the 1912 Presidential election. Repub lican President Willi am Howard Taft, who h ad turned against the Aldrich Bill, seemed a sure-f ire bet for reelection un til Taft's predecessor, fellow Republican Teddy Roosevelt, agreed to run on the ticket of the Progressive Party. In America's 60 Famili es, Ferdinand Lundb erg ackno wledges: \"As s oon as Roosevelt signified that he would again challenge Taft the President's defeat was inevitable. Throughou t the three-cornered fight [Taft-Roosevelt-Wilson] Roosevelt had [Morgan agents Frank] Munsey and [George] Perkins con stantly at his heels, supp lying money, going over his s peec hes, b ringing people from Wa ll Street in to h elp, and, in g eneral, carrying the e ntire burden o f the ca mpaign against Taft. . . . Perkins and J. P. Morgan and Company were the substance of the Progressive Party; everything else was trimmi ng. . . . In short, most of Roosevelt's campaign fund was s upp lied by the two Morgan h atchet men who were seeking Taft's scalp.\" (Pp. 110 -112) The Democrat candidate, Wood row Wilson, was equally the property of Morgan. Dr. Gabriel Kolko in h is The Triumph o f Conservatism, reports: \"In late 1907 h e [Wilson] suppo rted the Aldrich Bill on b anking, and was full of praise for Morgan's role in American society.\" (Page 205 ) According to Lundberg: \"For nearly twenty y ears before his nomi nation Wood row Wilson h ad moved in the shadow of Wall Street.\" (Page 112 ) Wood row Wilson and Teddy Roosevelt procee ded to whistle-stop the c oun try trying to ou t-do eac h o ther in florid (and hypocritical) denun ciations of the Wall Street \"money trust\"-the same group o f Insiders which was financing the ca mpaigns of both. Dr. Kolko goes on to tell us that, at the beginning of 1912, b anking reform \"seemed a dead issue. ... The banking reform m ovement had n eatly isolated itself.\" Wilson resurrected the issue a nd p romi sed the c oun try a money system free from domi nation by the international bankers of Wall Street. Moreover, the Democrat platform expressly stated: \"We a re oppo sed to the Aldrich plan for a ce ntral bank. \" But the '\"Big Boys\" knew w ho they had bo ught. Among the international financiers who contributed h eavily to the Wilson campaign, in addition to those a lready named, were Jacob Schiff, Bernard Baruch, Henry Morgenthau, Thomas Fortune Ryan, and New York Tim es pub lisher Adolph Ochs. The Insiders' sheepdog who controlled Wilson and guided the program t hrough Congress was the mysterious \"Colonel\" Edward Mandel House, the British-educated"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"son o f a representative of England's financial interests in the American South.

In h is The Intim ate Papers of Colonel House, Professor Charles Seymour refers to the \"Colonel\" as the \"unseen guardian angel\" of the Federal Reserve Act. Seymour's work contains numerous documents and records s howing constant contact between House and Paul Warburg while the Federal Reserve Act was being prepared and steered through Congress. Biographer George Viereck assures us that \"The Schiffs, the Warburgs, the Kahns, the Rockefellers, and the Morgans put their faith in House. ... \" Their faith was amply rewarded. In order to suppo rt the fiction that the Federal Reserve Act was \"a people's bill,\" the Insider financiers put up a smoke-screen o f oppo sition to it. It was s trictly a case of Br'er Rabbit begging not to b e thrown into the briar patch. Both Aldrich and Vanderlip d enou nced what in actuality was their own b ill. Nearly twenty-f ive years later Frank Vanderlip admitt ed: \"Now although the Aldrich Federal Reserve Plan was defeated when it bore the name Aldrich, n evertheless its essential points were a ll contained in the plan that finally was adop ted.\" Taking advantage of Congress' desire to adjourn for Christm as, the Federal Reserve Act was passed on December 22, 1913 by a vo te of 298 to 60 in the House, and in the Senate by a majority of 43 to 25.

The Committ ee warned that a major crash h ad b een planned in 1927. At a secret luncheon o f the Federal Reserve Board and h eads of the European central banks, the c ommitt ee warned, the international bankers were tightening the noo se. Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank o f England, came to Washington on February 6, 1929, to confer with Andrew Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury.

During the Wilson Admi nistration* alone, the national debt expanded 800 percent. Two months prior to the passage of the Federal Reserve Act, the c onspirators had created the mechanism t o collect the fund s to p ay the interest on the national debt. That m echanism was the progressive income tax, the second p lank of Karl Marx' Comm unist Manifesto which contained ten p lanks for SOCIALIZING a c ountry. One quite naturally assumes that the graduated income tax would b e oppo sed by the wealthy. The fact is that m any of the wealthiest Americans s uppo rted it. Some, no doub t, ou t of altruism and b eca use, at first, the taxes were very small. But others backed the scheme beca use they already had a plan for permanently avoiding both the income tax and the subsequent inheritance tax. What happened was this: At the turn o f the century the Popu lists, a group of rural socialists, were gaining strength and challenging the power of the New Y ork b ankers and monopo list indu strialists. While the Popu lists had the wrong answers, they asked many of the right questions. Unfortunately, they were led to b elieve that the banker- monopo list control over government, which they oppo sed, was a produ ct of fr ee enterprise. Since the Popu list threat to the ca rtelists was from t he Left (there being no o rganized politi cal m ovement for laissez-f aire), the Insiders moved to capture the Left. Professor Quigley discloses that over fifty y ears ago the Morgan firm decided to infiltrate the Leftwing politi cal m ovement in the United States. This was not difficult to do since these Left group s needed fund s and were eager for help to get their message to the pub lic. Wall Street supp lied bo th. There was nothing new abou t this decision, says Quigley, since other financiers had talked abou t it and even attempted it earli er. He continues: \"What m ade it decisively im portant this tim e was the c ombination o f its adoption by the domi nant Wall Street financier, at a tim e when tax policy was driving all financiers to seek tax-exempt refuges for their fortunes ...\" (Page 938 ) Radical m ovements are never successful unless they attract big money and/or outside suppo rt. The great historian o f the Twentieth Century, Oswald Spengler, was one of those who saw w hat American Liberals refuse to see- that the Left is controlled by its alleged enemy, the malefactors of great wealth. He wrote in h is monu mental Decline of the West (Modern Library, New Y ork, 194 5): \"There is no p roletarian, no t even a Comm unist, movement, that has not operated in the interests of money, in the direction indicated by money, and for the time being permitt ed by money-and that withou t the idealists among its leaders having the slightest suspicion o f the fact.\""},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"While the Popu list m ovement was basically non -conspiratorial, its Leftist ideology and p latform were made to o rder for the e liti st Insiders because it aim ed at concentrating power in gov ernment. The Insiders knew they could control that power and u se it t o their own p urposes. They were not, of course, interested in p romoting competiti on bu t in restricting it. Professor Gabriel Kolko h as prepared a lengthy volume presenting the undeniable proof that the giant corporate manipulators promoted much o f the so-called \"progressive legislation\" of the Roosevelt and Wilson eras-legislation which o stensibly was aim ed at controlling their abuses, bu t which was so written as to suit t heir interests. In The Triumph of Conservatism (by which Kolko mi stakenly means big business), he notes: \"... the significant reason for many businessmen welcomi ng and working to increase federal intervention into their affairs has been v irtually ignored by historians and econo mi sts. The oversight was due to the illusion that American indu stry was centralized and monopo lized to such an extent that it could rationalize the ac tivity [regulate produ ction and p rices] in its various branches voluntarily. Quite the oppo site was true. Despite the large numbers of mergers, and the growth in the a bsolute size of many corporations, the domi nant tendency in the American econo my at the beginning of this century was toward growing competiti on. Competiti on was unacc eptable to many key business and financial interests. ...\" The best way for the Insiders to elimi nate this growing competiti on was to im pose a progressive income tax on their competitors while writing the laws s o as to include built-in escape hatches for themselves. Actually, very few of the propo nents of the graduated income tax realized they were playing into the hands of those they were seeking to control. As Ferdinand Lundb erg notes in The Rich And The Super- Rich: \"What it [the income tax] beca me, finally, was a siphon gradually inserted into the pocketbook s of the general pub lic. Imposed to popu lar huzzas as a c lass tax, the income tax was gradually turned into a mass tax in a jiujitsu turnaround. ... \" The Insiders' principal m outhpiece in the Senate during this period was Nelson Aldrich, on e of the c onspirators invo lved in engineering the creation o f the Federal Reserve a nd the maternal grandfather of Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller. Lundberg says that \"When Aldrich spoke, newsmen un derstood that althou gh the words were his, the dramatic line was s urely approved by 'Big John ID. Rockefeller]. ...' \" In earlier years Aldrich h ad d enou nced the income tax as \"communistic a nd socialistic,\" but in 1909 he pulled a dramatic a nd stunn ing reversal. The American Biographical Dictionary comm ents: \"Just when the oppo sition h ad b ecome formi dable he [Aidrich] took the wind ou t of its s ails by bringing forward, with the suppo rt of the President [Taft], a propo sed amendment to the Constitution empowering Congress to lay income taxes.\" Howard Hinton records in h is biography of Cordell Hull t hat Congressman Hull, who had b een pu shing in the House for the income tax, wrote this s tunn ed ob servation: \"During the past few w eeks the unexpected spectacle of certain so-called 'old-line conservative' [sic] Repub lican leaders in Congress sudd enly reversing their attit ude of a lifetim e a nd seemi ngly espou sing, through ill-concea led reluctance, the propo sed"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"income-tax amendment to the Constitution h as been the occasion o f universal surprise and wond er.\" The e scape hatch for the Insiders to avoid p aying taxes was ready. By the time the Amendment had b een approved by the states (even b efore the income-tax was passed), the Rockefellers and Carnegie found ations were in full operation. One must remember that it was to b reak up the Standard Oil (Rockefeller) and U.S. Steel (Carnegie) monopo lies that the various anti-trust acts were ostensibly passed. These monopo lists could no w compound their wealth tax-tree while c ompetitors had to face a graduated income tax which made it difficult t o amass capital. As we have said, socialism i s not a share-the-wealth p rogram, as the socialists would like you to believe, bu t a consolidate-and -control-the-wealth p rogram for the Insiders. The Reece Committ ee which investigated found ations for Congress in 1953 p roved with an overwhelmi ng amoun t of evidence that the various Rockefeller and Carnegie found ations have been p romoting socialism since their inception. (See Rene Wormser's Found ations: Their Power and Influence, Devin Adair, New Y ork, 1958. ) The c onspirators now had created the mechanisms to run up the debt, to collect the debt, and (for themselves) to avoid the taxes required to p ay the yearly interest on the debt. Then all t hat was needed was a reason to escalate the debt. Nothing runs up a national debt li ke a war. And World War I was being brewed in Europe. In 1916, Wood row Wilson was re-elected by a hair. He had based h is campaign on the slogan: \"He Kept Us Out of War!\" The American pub lic was extremely oppo sed to America's getting involved in a European war. Staying out of the perennial foreign quarrels had been an American tradition since George Washington. But as Wilson was s tumping the c oun try giving his s olemn word that American soldiers would no t be sent into a foreign war, he was preparing to do just the oppo site. His \"alter ego,\" as he ca lled \"Colonel\" House, was making behind -the-scenes agreements with England which committ ed America to entering the war. Just five months later we were in it. The same crowd which manipulated the passage of the income tax and the Federal Reserve System wanted America in the war. J. P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, \"Colonel\" House, Jacob Schiff, Paul Warburg and the rest of the Jekyl Island conspirators were a ll deeply invo lved in getting us invo lved. Many of these financiers had loaned England large sums of money. In fact, J. P. Morgan & Co. served as British financial agents in this coun try during World War I. While a ll of the standard reasons given for the outbreak o f World War I in Europe doub tless were factors, there were a lso o ther more im portant causes. The c onspiracy had b een p lanning the war for over two d ecades. The a ssassination o f an Austrian Archdu ke was merely an incident providing an excuse for starting a c hain reac tion. After years of fighting, the war was a c omplete stalemate a nd would h ave e nded alm ost imm ediately in a negotiated settlement (as had most other European con flicts) had no t the U.S. declared war on Germany."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"As s oon as Wilson's re-election h ad b een engineered through the \"he kept us out of war\" slogan, a c omplete reversal of propaganda was instituted. In those days before radio and television, pub lic opinion was controlled alm ost exclusively by newspapers. Many of the major newspapers were c ontrolled by the Federal Reserve c rowd. Now they began b eating the drums over the \"inevitabilit y of war.\" Arthur Ponsonby, a memebr of the British p arliament, admitt ed in h is book Falsehood In Wa r Tim e (E. P. Dutton & Co., Inc., New Y ork, 1928 ): \"There must have been more deliberate lying in the world from 1914 to 1918 than in any other period o f the world's history.\" Propaganda concerning the war was heavily one-sided. Althou gh after the war many historians admitt ed that one side was as guilty as the other in starting the war, Germany was pictured as a milit aristic monster which wanted to rule the world. Remember, this picture was painted by Britain which h ad its s oldiers in more coun tries around the world than all other nations put together. So-called \"Prussian milit arism\" did exist, but it was no threat to conq uer the world. Meanwhile, the sun never set on the British Empire! Actually, the Germans were proving to b e tough business competitors in the world's markets and the British d id no t approve. In order to generate war fever, the sinking of the Lusitania-a British ship torpedoed two years earlier-was revived and given renewed h eadlines. German submarine warfare was turned into a major issue by the newspapers. Submarine warfare was a pho ny issue. Germany and England were a t war. Each was blockading the other country. J. P. Morgan and o ther financiers were selling munitions to Britain. The Germans could no t allow those supp lies to b e delivered any more than the English would h ave a llowed them to b e delivered to Germany. If Morgan wanted to take the risks and reap the rewards (or suffer the c onsequences) of selling munitions to England, that was his business. It was certainly no thing over which the e ntire nation shou ld h ave been dragged into war. The Lusitania, at the tim e it was s unk, was carrying six milli on pound s of amm unition. It was actually illegal for American passengers to b e a board a ship carrying munitions to b elligerents. Alm ost two years before the liner was sunk, the New Y ork Tribun e (June 19, 1913 ) carried a squib which stated: \"Cunard officials ackno wledged to the Tribun e c orrespond ent today that the greyhound [Lusitania] is being equipped with h igh power naval rifles. ...\" In fact, the Lusitania was registered in the British n avy as an auxiliary cruiser. (Barnes, Harry E., The Genesis of the War, Alfred Knopf, New Y ork, 1926, p. 611. ) In addition, the German government took ou t large a ds in all t he New Y ork p apers warning potential passengers that the ship was carrying munitions and telling them not to cross the Atlantic on it. Those who chose to make the trip kn ew the risk they were taking. Yet the sinking of the Lusitania was used by clever propagandists to po rtray the Germans as inhu man slaughterers of inno cents. Submarine warfare was manufactured into a ca use ce lebre to p ush u s into war. On April 6, 1917, Congress declared war. The American p eople ac quiesced on the basis that it would b e a \"war to end all wars.\" During the \"war to end all wars,\" Insider banker Bernard Baruch was made a bsolute dictator over American business when President Wilson appo inted h im Chairman o f the War Indu stries Board, where he had control of all domestic c ontracts for Allied war materials.

But it was a catastroph e of such magnitude for the United States that few even today grasp its im portance. The war reversed ou r traditional foreign po licy of non-invo lvement and we have been enmeshed alm ost constantly ever since in p erpetual wars for perpetual peace. Winston Churchill once observed that all nations would h ave been b etter off had the U.S. mi nded its own bu siness.

The Bolshevik Revolution in Russia was obv iously one of the great turning po ints in world h istory. It is an event over which mi sinformation abound s. The myth-makers and re-writers of history have don e their landscape painting jobs well. The establishing of Comm unism i n Russia is a c lassic e xample of the second \"big lie\" of Comm unism, i.e., that it is the movement of the downtrodd en masses rising up against exploiting bosses. This cunn ing deception h as been fostered since before the first French Revolution in 1789. Most people today believe the Comm unists were succe ssful in Russia because they were a ble to rally behind them t he sympathy and frustration o f the Russian p eople who were sick o f the tyranny of the Czars. This is to ignore the history of what actually happened. While a lm ost everybody is reminded that the Bolshevik Revolution took p lace in November of 1917, few kno w that the Czar had abdicated seven months earlier in March. When Czar Nicholas II abdicated, a provisional government was established by Prince Lvov who wanted to p attern the new Russian government after our own. But, un fortunately, the Lvov government gave way to the Kerensky regim e. Kerensky, a so-called democratic socialist, may have been runn ing a ca retaker government for the Comm unists. He kept the war going against Germany and the other Central Powers, bu t he issued a general amnesty for Comm unists and other revolutionaries, many of whom had b een exiled after the a bortive Red Revolution o f 1905. Back to mother Russia ca me 250,000 d edicated revolutionaries, and Kerensky's own government's doo m was s ealed."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"In the Soviet Union, as in every Comm unist coun try (or as they call t hemselves-the Socialist coun tries), the power has not come to the Comm unists' hands because the downtrodd en masses willed it so. The power has come from t he top do wn in every instance. Let us briefly reconstruct the sequences of the Comm unist takeover. The year is 1917. The Allies are fighting the Central Powers. The Allies include Russia, the British Comm onwealth, France a nd by April 1917, the United States. In March o f 1917, p urposeful planners s et in motion the forces to compel Czar Nicholas II to abdicate. He did so und er pressure from t he Allies after severe riots in the Czarist capitol of Petrograd, riots that were ca used by the breakdo wns in the transportation system which cut the c ity off fr om food supp lies and led to the c losing of factories. But where were Lenin and Trotsky when all t his was taking place? Lenin was in Switzerland and h ad b een in Western Europe since 1905 when h e was exiled for trying to topp le the Czar in the a bortive Comm unist revolution o f that year. Trotsky also was in exile, a reporter for a Comm unist newspaper on the lower east side of New Y ork City. The Bolsheviks were not a visible politi cal force a t the tim e the Czar abdicated. And they came to po wer not because the downtrodd en masses of Russia called them back, bu t because very powerful m en in Europe a nd the United States sent them i n. Lenin was s ent across Europe-at-war on the famous \"sealed train.\" With h im Lenin took some $5 to $6 mill ion in gold. The whole thing was arranged by the German high comm and and Max Warburg, throu gh ano ther very wealthy and life-long socialist by the name of Alexander Helphand alias \"Parvus.\" When Trotsky left New York aboard the S. S. Christiania, on March 27, 1917, with h is entourage of 275 revolutionaries, the first port of call was Halifax, Nova Scoti a. There the Canadians grabbed Trotsky and h is money and im pound ed them both. This was a very logical thing for the Canadian government to do for Trotsky had said many tim es that if he were succe ssful in comi ng to po wer in Russia he would imm ediately stop what he called the \"im perialist war\" and sue for a separate peace with Germany. This would free milli ons of German troop s for transfer fr om t he Eastern front to the Western front where they could k ill Canadians. So Trotsky cooled h is heels in a Canadian p rison -f or five days. Then all of a sudd en the British (through future Kuhn, Loeb p artner Sir Willi am Wiseman) and the United States (through non e other than the ubiquitous \"Colonel\" House) pressured the Canadian government. And, d espite the fact we were now in the war, said, in so many words, \"Let Trotsky go.\" Thus, with an American passport, Trotsky went back to meet Lenin. They joined up, and, by November, through b ribery, cunn ing, brutality and dece ption, they were a ble (not to b ring the masses rallying to their cause, bu t) to h ire e nough thugs and make e nough deals to im pose out of the gun barrel what Lenin called \"all power to the Soviets.\" The Comm unists came to p ower by seizing a mere handful of key cities. In fact, practically the whole Bolshevik Revo lution took place in on e c ity-Petrograd. It was as if the whole United States beca me Comm unist beca use a Comm unist-led mob seized Washington, D. C. It was years before the Soviets s olidified po wer throughout Russia. The Germans, on the face of it, had a plausible e xcuse for financing Lenin and Trotsky.

They could claim t hat they were serving their coun try's cause by helping and financing Lenin. However,"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"these two German \"patriots\" neglected to mention to the Kaiser their plan to foment a Comm unist revolution in Russia. The picture takes on another dim ension when you consider that the brother of Max Warburg was Paul Warburg, prim e mov er in establishing the Federal Reserve System and who from his position on the Federal Reserve Board o f Directors, played a key role in financing the American war effort. (When n ews leaked ou t in American papers abou t brother Max runn ing the German finance s, Paul resigned from his Federal Reserve post withou t a whim per.) From here on the plot sickens. For the father-in-law of Max Warburg's brother, Felix, was Jacob Schiff, senior partner in Kuhn, Loeb & Co. (Paul and Felix Warburg, you will reca ll, were a lso partners in Kuhn, Loeb & Co. while Max ran the Rothschild-allied fami ly bank o f Frankfurt.) Jacob Schiff also h elped finance Leon Trotsky.

One of the best sources of information on the financing of the Bolshevik Revolution is Czarism and the Revolution by an im portant White Russ ian General named Arsene de Goulevitch who was founder in France of the Union o f Oppressed Peoples. In this volume, written in French and subsequently translated into English, d e Goulevitch notes: \"The main p urveyors of fund s for the revolution, however, were neither the c rackpo t Russian milli onaires nor the a rmed b andits of Lenin.

We ca n on ly theorize on the manner in which Moscow is controlled from New Y ork, London and Paris. Undoubtedly much o f the c ontrol is econo mi c, bu t certainly the international bankers have a n enforcer arm within Russia to k eep the Soviet leaders in line. The organization may be SMERSH, the international Comm unist m urder organization d escribed in testim ony before Congressional Commi ttees and by Ian Flemi ng in h is James Bond book s. For although the Bond no vels were wildly im aginative, Flemi ng had b een in British Navy intelligence, maintained excellent intelligence c ontacts around the world and was reputedly a keen student of the international conspiracy. We do kno w this, ho wever. A clique of American financiers not on ly helped establish Comm unism i n Russia, but has s triven mi ghtily ever since to k eep it alive. Ever since 1918 this clique has been engaged in transferring money and, p robably more im portant, technical information, to the Soviet Union. This is made a bund antly clear in the three volume history Western Techno log y and Soviet Econo mi c Development by scholar Antony Sutton o f Stanford University's Hoov er Institution on War, Revolution and Peace . Using, for the most part, official State Departm ent documents, Sutton shows conclusively that virtually everything the Soviets possess has been acquired from t he West. It is not m uch o f an exaggeration to say that the U.S.S.R. was made in the U.S.A. The landscape painters, un able to refute Sutton's monu mental scholarship, sim ply paint him out of the picture. At Versailles, this s ame clique ca rved up Europe and set the stage for World War II.

In 1941, the same Insiders rushed to the a id o f our \"noble a lly,\" Stalin, after his break with Hitler. In 1943, these same Insiders marched off to the Teheran Conference a nd p rocee ded to start the carving up o f Europe after the second great \"war to end war.\" Again at Yalta a nd Potsdam i n 1945, they established the China policy ... later summ arized by Owen Lattimore: \"The problem was how to allow them [China] to fall withou t m aking it l ook as if the United States had pu shed them.\" The facts are inescapable. In on e c oun try after another Comm unism has been im posed on the local popu lation from t he top do wn. The most promi nent forces for the im position o f that tyranny came from t he United States and Great Britain. Here is a c harge that no American enjoys making, bu t the facts lead to no o ther possible conclusion. The idea that Comm unism is a movement of the downtrodd en masses is a fraud. None of the foregoing makes s ense if Comm unism really is what the Comm unists and the Establishment tell us it i s. But if Comm unism is an arm of a bigger conspiracy to control the world by power- mad b illi onaires (and b rilli ant but ruthless aca demi cians who h ave shown them how to u se their power) it all becomes perfectly logical. It is at this point that we shou ld again make it clear that this conspiracy is not m ade up solely of bankers and international cartelists, bu t includes every field o f human endeavor. Starting with Voltaire a nd Adam Weishaupt and runn ing through John Ruskin, Sidney Webb, Nicholas M urray Butler, and on to the present with Henry Kissinger and John Kenneth Galbraith, it has always been the scholar look ing for avenues of power who h as s hown the \"sons of the very powerful\"' how their wealth could b e used to rule the world. We ca nno t stress too g reatly the im portance of the reader keeping in mi nd that this book is discussing only one segment of the c onspiracy, certain international bankers. Other equally im portant segments which work to foment labor, religious and racial strife in o rder to p romote socialism have been described in nu merous other book s. These other divisions of the c onspiracy operate independently of the international bankers in most cases and it would certainly be disastrous to ignore the danger to ou r freedom they represent. It would be e qually disastrous to lump all businessmen and b ankers into the conspiracy. One must draw the distinction b etween competiti ve free enterprise, the most m oral and p rodu ctive system ever devised, and cartel capitalism domi nated by indu strial m onopo lists and international bankers. The difference is the private enterpriser operates by offering produ cts and services in a c ompetiti ve free market while the ca rtel capitalist uses the government to force the pub lic to do bu siness with him . These c orporate socialists are the deadly enemi es of competiti ve private enterprise. Liberals are willi ng to b elieve that these \"robb er barons\" will fix prices, rig markets, establish monopo lies, bu y politi cians, exploit employees and fire them t he day before they are e ligible for pensions, bu t they absolutely will not believe that these same men would want to rule the world o r would u se Comm unism as the striking edge of their"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"conspiracy.

In every other area, of course, they encourage dissent as being healthy in a \"democracy.\""},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"5 - Establishing The Establishment One of the prim ary reasons the Insiders worked b ehind the scenes to foment WW I was to create in its aftermath a world government. If you wish to establish n ational monopo lies, you must control national governments. If you wish to establish international m onopo lies or cartels, you must control a world government. After the Armi stice on November 11, 1918, Wood row Wilson and h is alter ego, \"Colonel\" House (the e ver present front m an for the Insiders), went to Europe in hop es of establishing a world government in the form of the League of Nations. When the negotiations revealed one side had b een abou t as guilty as the other, and the glitt er of the \"moral crusade\" evaporated along with Wilson's vaunted \"Fourteen Points,\" the \"rubes back on Main Street\" began to waken. Reaction and d isillusionment set in. Americans certainly didn't want to get into a World Government with dou ble-dealing Europeans whose specialty was secret treaty hidden b ehind secret treaty. The guest of hono r, so to speak, stalked ou t of the banqu et before the poisoned meal could b e served. And, withou t American inclusion, there c ould b e no meaningful World Government. Aroused pub lic opinion made it obv ious that the U.S. Senate dared no t ratify a treaty saddling the c oun try with such an internationalist commitm ent. In some manner the American pub lic had to b e sold on the idea of internationalism and World Government. Again, the key was \"Colonel\" House. House had set down h is politi cal ideas in h is book called Philip Dru: Admi nistrator in 1912. In this book House laid ou t a thinly fictionalized p lan for conqu est of America by establishing \"Socialism as dreamed by Karl Marx.\" He described a \"conspiracy\"- the word is his-which succee ds in electing a U.S. President by means of \"deception regarding his real opinions and intentions.\" Among other things, House wrote that the conspiracy was to insinuate \"itself into the prim aries, in o rder that no candidate mi ght be nomi nated whose views were not in accord with theirs.\" Elections were to b ecome mere c harades condu cted for the bedazzlement of the boobo isie. The idea was to u se both the Democrat and Repub lican p arties as instruments to p romote World Government. In 1919 House met in Paris with members of a British \"secret society\" called The Round Table in o rder to form an o rganization whose job it would b e to p ropagandize the c itizens of America , England and Western Europe on the glories of World Government. The big selling point, of course, was \"peace .\" The part abou t the Insiders establishing a world d ictatorship qu ite naturally was left out. The Round Table organization in England g rew out of the life-long dream of gold and diamond magnate Cecil Rhod es for a \"new w orld order.\" Rhod es' biographer Sara Milli n was a littl e more direct. As s he put it: \"The government of the world was Rhod es' sim ple desire.\" Quigley notes:"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"\"In the mi ddle 189 0's Rhod es had a personal income of at least a milli on pound s sterling a year (then about five milli on do llars) which h e spent so freely for his mysterious purposes that he was usually overdrawn on h is acc oun t. ...\" Cecil Rhod es' commitm ent to a c onspiracy to establish World Government was s et down in a series of wills described by Frank Aydelotte in h is book American Rhod es Scholarships. Aydelotte writes: \"The seven wills which Cecil Rhod es made between the ages of 24 and 4 6 [Rhod es died at age forty-eight] constit ute a kind o f spiritual autobiography. ... Best kno wn are the first (the Secret Society Will ...), and the last, which established the Rhodes Scholarships. ... In h is first will Rhod es s tates his aim still m ore specifically: 'The e xtension o f British rule throughou t the world. ... the found ation o f so great a power as to h ereafter render wars im possible a nd p romote the interests of humanity.' The 'Confession o f Faith' enlarges upon these ideas. The model for this proposed secret society was the Society of Jesus, thou gh h e mentions also the Masons.\" It shou ld b e noted that the originator of this type of secret society was Adam Weishaupt, the monster who found ed the Order of Illumi nati on May 1, 1 776, for the purpose of conspiracy to control the world. The role of Weishaupt's Illumi nists in such ho rrors as the Reign of Terror is unqu estioned, and the techniques of the Illumi nati have long been recognized as models for Comm unist m ethodo logy. Weishaupt also u sed the structure of the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) as his model, and rewrote his Code in Masonic terms. Aydelotte c ontinues: \"In 1888 Rhod es made his third will ... leaving everything to Lord Rothschild [his financier in mi ning enterprises], with an acc ompanying letter enclosing 'the written matter discussed b etween us.' This, on e surmi ses, consisted o f the first will and the 'Confession o f Faith,' since in a postscript Rhod es says 'in considering questions suggested take Constitution o f the Jesuits if obtainable. ...'\" Apparently for strategic reasons Lord Rothschild was s ubsequently removed from t he forefront of the scheme. Professor Quigley reveals that Lord Rosebury \"replace d h is father- in-law, Lord Rothschild, h i Rhod es' secret group and was made a Trustee und er Rhod es' next (and last), will.\" The \"secret society\" was organized on the c onspiratorial pattern o f circles within circles. Professor Quigley informs us that the ce ntral part of the \"secret society\" was established by March, 1 891, u sing Rhod es' money. The organization was run for Rothschild by Lord Alfred Milner, discussed in the last chapter as a key financier of the Bolshevik revolution. The Round Table worked b ehind the scenes at the highest levels of British government, influencing foreign policy and England's invo lvement and condu ct of WWI. According to Professor Quigley: \"At the e nd of the war of 1914, it beca me c lear that the organization o f this system [the Round Table Group ] had to b e greatly extended. Once again the task was entrusted to Lionel Curtis who established, in England and each do mi nion, a front"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"organization to the e xisting Round Table Group. This front organization, called the Royal Institute of International Affairs, had as its nucleus in eac h area the e xisting submerged Round Table Group. In New Y ork it was kno wn as the Coun cil on Foreign Relations, and was a front for J. P. Morgan and Company in association with the very small American Round Table Group. The American o rganizers were domi nated by the large number of Morgan 'experts,' ... who had gone to the Paris Peace Conference and there beca me c lose friends with the simil ar group o f English 'experts' which h ad been recruited by the Milner group. In fact, the original plans for the Royal Institute of International Affairs and the Coun cil on Foreign Relations [C.F.R.] were drawn up in Paris. ... \" Joseph Kraft (C.F.R.), however, tells us in Harper's of July 1958, that the chief agent in the formal found ing of the Coun cil on Foreign Relations was \"Colonel\" House, suppo rted by such p roteges as Walter Lippmann, John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles and Christian Herter. It was House who acted as host for the Round Table Group, bo th English and American, at the key meeting of May 19, 1919, in the Majestic Hotel, Paris, which committ ed the c onspiracy to creation o f the C.F.R. Althou gh Quigley stresses the im portance of Morgan men at the creation o f the organization kno wn as the Coun cil on Foreign Relations, this organization's own materials and \"Colonel\" House's own memoirs reveal his function as mi dwife a t the birth o f the C.F.R. The C.F.R.'s Twenty-Fifth Annu al Report tells us this of the C.F.R.'s foun ding at Paris: \"... The Institute of International Affairs found ed at Paris in 1919 was comprised, at the outset, of two b ranches, on e in the United Kingdom and o ne in the U.S. ... \" Later the plan was changed to create a n o stensible autono my because, \"... it seemed unwise to set up a single institute with b ranches.\" It had to be made to appear that the C.F.R. in America, and the R.I.I.A. in Britain, were really independent bodies, lest the American pub lic become aware the C.F.R. was in fact a subsidiary of the Round Table Group and react in patriotic fury. According to Quigley, the most im portant financial dynasties in America following WW I were (in addition to Morgan) the Rockefeller fami ly; Kuhn, Loeb & Company; Dillon Read and Company and Brown Bros. Harriman. All were represented in the C.F.R. and Paul Warburg was one of the incorporators. The Insider crowd which created the Federal Reserve System, many of whom also b ankrolled the Bolshevik Revolution, were a ll i n the original m embership. In addition to Paul Warburg, found ers of the C.F.R. included international financial Insiders Jacob Schiff, Averell Harrim an, Frank Vanderlip, Nelson Aldrich, Bernard Baruch, J. P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller. These men d id no t create the C.F.R. beca use they had no thing better to do with their tim e a nd money. They created it as a tool to further their ambitions. The C.F.R. has come to be kno wn as \"The Establishment,\" \" the invisible government\" and \"the Rockefeller foreign o ffice.\" This s emi -secret organization unqu estionably has become the most influential group in America."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"One of the e xtremely infrequent articles to appear in the national press concerning this Coun cil was pub lished in the Christian Science Monitor of September 1, 1961.

One is the Soviet Embassy to the United Nations. ... Directly oppo site on the southwest corner is the Coun cil on Foreign Relations-probably one of the most influential semi -pub lic organizations in the field o f foreign po licy.\" Althou gh the formal m embership in the C.F.R. is composed o f close to 1 500 o f the most elite names in the worlds of government, labor, bu siness, finance, comm unications, the foundations, and the a cademy-and d espite the fact that it has staffed alm ost every key position o f every admi nistration since those of FDR-it i s doub tful that one American in a thou sand so much as recognizes the Coun cil's name, or that one in ten thou sand can relate a nything at all abou t it s s tructure or purpose.

What m akes this s ecret organization so influential? No on e who kno ws for a ce rtainty will say. The Christian Science Monitor, which is edited by a member of the American Round Table (a branch of Milner's s ecret society) did no t in the a rticle of September 1, 1961, that \"it s roster ... contains names distinguished in the field o f diplomacy, government, bu siness, finance, science, labor, journalism, law and education. What united so wide-r anging and d isparate a membership is a passionate concern for the direction o f American foreign po licy.\" The Christian Science Monitor indicates the fantastic power the C.F.R. has had du ring the last six admi nistrations: \"Because of the Council's s ingle-mi nded d edication to studying and d eliberating American foreign po licy, there is a c onstant flow of its members from private to pub lic service.

As World War II approached, the Round Table Group was influential in seeing that Hitler was not stopp ed in Austria, the Rhineland, o r Sudetenland -and thereby was largely respon sible for precipitating the holocaust. A second world war would greatly enhance the oppo rtunity for establishment of World Government. The financing for Adolph Hitler's rise to po wer was handled through the Warburg-controlled Mendelsohn Bank o f Amsterdam and later by the J. Henry Schroeder Bank with branches in Frankfurt, London and New Y ork. Chief legal coun sel to the J. Henry Schroeder Bank was the firm of Sullivan and Cromwell whose senior partners included John Foster and Allen Dulles, (See James M artin's All Hono rable Men, Littl e Brown Co., New York, 1950, p. 51.

The Coun cil's first task was to infiltrate a nd d evelop effective c ontrol of the U.S. State Departm ent-to make c ertain that after World War II there would b e no slip-ups as there had been following World War I. The story of the C.F.R. takeover of the Departm ent of State is contained in State Departm ent Publication 2349, Report To The President On The Results of the San Francisco Conference. It is the report of Secretary of State Edward R. Stettinius (C.F.R.) to President Truman.

Henry Kissinger, the \"Colonel\" House of the Nixon Admi nistration, came to h is job d irectly from employment on the C.F.R. staff. Kissinger represents the very oppo site of everything Nixon said h e stood for in h is campaign. Both Liberals and Conservatives admit Kissinger is by far the most im portant m an in the Nixon Admi nistration. Admi nistrations, bo th Democrat and Repub lican, come a nd go-but the C.F.R. lingers on. This is why the more things s eem t o change, the more they remain the same. The fix is in at the top, where the same c oterie of Insiders, bent on control of the world, runs the show. As Professor Quigley admit s: \"There does exist, and h as existed for a generation, an international ... n etwork which operates, to some e xtent, in the way the radical Right believes the Comm unists act. In fact, this network, which we may identify as the Round Table Group s, has no aversion to coop erating with the Comm unists, or any other group s, and frequently does s o.\" Yes, the Insiders have no aversion to working with the Comm unists whose ostensible goal is to d estroy them. While the Insiders are serving champagne a nd caviar to their guests in their summ er mansions at Newport, or entertaining other members of the social elite a board their yachts, their agents are out enslaving and murdering p eople. And you are next on their list. Clearly, the Chicago Tribune's editorial of December 9, 1950, on the C.F.R. still applies:"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"\"The members of the c ouncil [On Foreign Relations] are persons of much more than average influence in their comm unity. They have used the prestige that their wealth, their social position, and their education h ave given them t o lead their country toward bankruptcy and milit ary debacle. They shou ld look at their hands. There is blood on them-the dried b lood o f the last war and the fresh b lood o f the present one [the Korean War].\" It goes withou t saying that the C.F.R.'s hands are blood ier now w ith the gore of 50,000 Americans in Vietnam. Shamefully the Council has s ucceeded in p romoting, as American po licy, the shipment of American aid and trade to the East European arsenal of the Viet Cong for the killi ng of our sons in the field. It shou ld no t be surprising to learn that there is on the international level an organizational equivalent of the C.F.R. This group calls itself the Bildersbergers. If scarcely one American in a thou sand h as any famili arity with the C.F.R., it i s doub tful that one in five thou sand h as any kno wledge of the Bilderbergcrs. Again, this is not acc idental. The strange name of this group is taken from t he site of the first m eeting in May, 1954 -the Hotel de Bilderberg-in Oostebeek, Holland. The man who created the Bilderbergers is His Royal Highness Prince Bernhard o f the Netherlands. The Prince is an im portant figure in Royal Dutch Petroleum (Shell Oil) and the Societe General de Belgique, a huge c onglomerate cartel with worldwide holdings. The Bilderbergers meet once-or sometim es twice-a year. Those in attendance include leading politi cal and financial figures from t he United States and Western Europe. Prince Bernhard makes no effort to h ide the fact that the ultim ate goal of the Bilderbergers is a world government. In the meantim e, while the \"new w orld o rder\" is being built, the Bilderbergers coordinate the e fforts of the European and American po wer elites. Prince Bernhard's coun terpart among the American Bilderbergers is David Rockefeller, chairman o f the board o f the C.F.R., whose ec ono mi c base is the giant Chase Manhattan Bank and Standard Oil. Among the other Bilderbergers from t he world o f ultra-high finance a re Baron Edmund de Rothschild o f the Hou se of Rothschild, C. Douglas Dillon (C.F.R.) of Dillon Read & Co., Robert McNamara of the World Bank, Sir Eric Roll of S. G. Warburg & Co., Ltd., Pierce Paul Schweitzer of the International Monetary Fund, and George Ball (C.F.R.) of Lehman Brothers. Not everyone who attends one of the Bilderbergers' secret m eetings is an Insider, bu t only men o f the Left are a llowed to attend the private meetings following the general sessions. The a vowedly Socialist Parties of Europe a re well represented ... another example of the tie-in b etween the Insiders of high finance a nd the ostensible leaders of the proletariat. Bilderberg policy is not planned by those who attend the conferences, bu t by the elite steering committ ee of Insiders composed of 24 Europeans and 15 Americans. Past and p resent Americans of the Bilderberger Steering Committ ee include George W. Ball, Gardner Cowles, John H. Ferguson, Henry J. Heinz II, Robert D.

Prince Bernha rd o f the Netherland s, head o f the secret, on e world Bilderberger movement, confers with President Nixon, A former Nazi SS storm troop er (\"We had a lot of fun\"), Bernha rd n ow w orks with the Rothschilds and Comm unists to promote a World Sup er State of the e lite. Bernha rd ho lds yearly secret meetings with h igh U.S. officials, ban kers and indu strialists to map p lans for merging the U.S. and the Soviet Union into a world go vernment. After last meeting, Nixon d evalued the dollar and opened up trade with Red China. Edmond and Guy de Rothschild, leaders of the French Rothschild clan. The Rothschilds are c losely conn ected with Prince Bernha rd in bu siness (Royai Dutch shell) and in the building of a on e world super-government with the Soviets.

Guy heads a versatile c lan o f modern da y Rothschilds.\" Edmond, reputedly the richest of the French Rothschilds, is worth $500 milli on p ersona lly, according to estimates. One would assume (that is, if one had no t read this book ) that when the world's leading parliamentarians and international tycoon s meet to d iscuss the planning of their various nations' foreign po licies, that the newshawks from papers and televisionland would b e screami ng to h igh h eaven that such an event held in secret makes a mockery of the democratic process. One mi ght expect Walter Cronk ite to b e thund ering in wrath about an elite c lique meeting to p lan ou r lives; or the New Y ork Tim es editorialists to b e pound ing their smoking typewriters, fumi ng abou t \"the pub lic's right to kno w.\" But, of course, the landscape painters merely brush the Bilderbergers right out of existence a nd focus the pub lic's attention on something like the c ond itions in the prisons or coke bottles litt ering the highways. Since the Bilderbergers are a group of the Left (or, as the Liberals in the media might say, bu t don 't, \"a group of progressives\") they are a llowed to go on in p eace a nd qu iet planning for 1984. The fact that there is heavy Rockefeller (Chase Manhattan Bank and C.F.R.) influence in the media might also h ave something to do with the fact that while everybody has heard o f, say, The John Birch Society (and alm ost always in a derogatory manner from t he Eastern Establishment m edia), practically nobody has heard o f the Bilderbergers. As this is written, there have been 29 Bilderberger meetings to d ate. They usually last three days and are held in remote, bu t plush qu arters. The participants are hou sed in one location and are protected by a thorough security network. Decisions are reached, resolutions adop ted, p lans of action initiated, bu t only Bilderbergers ever know for sure what occurred. We must assume that these people did no t congregate merely to discuss their golf scores. The press, naturally, is not allowed to b e present, althou gh occa sionally a brief press conference is held at the e nd o f the meeting at which tim e the news media are given in v ery general terms the Bilderberger version o f what was discussed. Why all t he secrecy if there is really nothing to h ide? Why do the Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie found ations finance the meetings if they are not important? Yes, why? The most rece nt m eeting took p lace a t Laurance Rockefeller's Wood stock Inn at Wood stock, Vermont, April 23, 24, 25, 1971. Apparently the only newspaper to carry a substantial story on the meeting was the Rutland, Vermont, Herald, whose reporter could acquire only sketchy information abou t what the meeting was all about. The April 20, 1971 issue of the Herald reported: \"A rather tight li d o f secrecy was being k ept on the c onference. ... A closed-doo r meeting was held in Wood stock last week to b rief a handful of local officials on some phases of the c onference. One participant of the meeting insisted Mond ay that the officials were told the meeting would b e a n 'international peace c onference.' However, other reliable sources said the c onference will deal with international finance. ... The Wood stock Inn will apparently be sealed up like Fort Knox. ... No p ress coverage will be a llowed, with the e xception o f issuing a statement at the c lose of the meeting on Sund ay.\""},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"When Prince Bernhard arrived at Boston's Logan Airport, he did admit t o reporters that the subject of the c onference would be the \"change in the world-role of the United States.\" Isn't it nice to h ave c hanges in America's role in the world decided upon by Bernhard, Rothschild and Rockefeller? There is real democracy in action, as they say. Present at the scene to carry back o rders to Mr. Nixon was C.F.R.- Rockefeller errand b oy, the President's Number One a dvisor on foreign affairs, Henry Kissinger. Shortly after the Wood stock meeting, two o mi nou s and \"role c hanging\" events occurred: Henry Kissinger went to Peking and arranged for the acceptance of Red China a s a member of the fami ly of trading nations; and an international monetary crisis developed after which the dollar was devalued. As the British statesman and Rothschild confidante Benjami n Disraeli wrote in Coningsby: \"So you see, my dear Coningsby, that the world is governed by very different personages from what is im agined by those who are not behind the scenes.\""},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"6 - The Rockefellers And The Reds The most im portant American o f those \"different personages\" who run the world from behind the scenes are the Rockefellers. The Rockefeller clan reportedly has worked with the Rothschilds and their agents s ince the 188O's when the original John D. arranged to get a rebate on every barrel of oil he and h is competitors s hipped ov er Kuhn, Loeb & Co.-controlled Pennsylvania a nd Baltim ore & Ohio railroads. It has been a profitable partnership ever since, althou gh there a ppear to h ave been areas in which the two financial dynasties competed. The invo lvement of the Rockefellers with their suppo sed b lood enemi es, the Comm unists, dates back to the Bolshevik Revolution. During the 192 0's Lenin established h is New Economi c Policy (the same name Mr. Nixon applied to h is wage- price c ontrol package), when the suppo sedly hated capitalists were invited back into Russia. The Federal Reserve-CFR Insiders began pu shing to op en up Comm unist Russia to U.S. traders s oon after the revolution. However, at that tim e pub lic opinion ran so high against the Bolsheviks beca use of their barbarism t hat it was official U.S. government policy not to d eal with the outlaw government. The U.S. did n ot officially recognize the Bolsheviks until 1933. In the meantime, the Soviet econo my was in a shambles and the people were starving to death. Comm unism would h ave c ollapsed had it not been aided by the Insiders. The Bolsheviks were originally saved from collapse by Herbert Hoover (CFR) who raised money to b uy food which was appropriated by Lenin and h is gangsters. They used it as a tool to subdu e starving peasants who h ad been resisting their newly im posed slave masters. While Hoov er's \"humanitarian\" gesture saved the Soviet regim e, the Russian econo my was still i n total chaos. In came the Vanderlips, Harrim ans and Rockefellers. One of the first to jump in was Frank Vanderlip, an agent of the Rockefellers and on e of the Jekyl Island conspirators, president of the Rockefeller First National City Bank, who compared Lenin to George Washington. (Louis Budenz, The Bolshevik Invasion Of The West, Book mailer, p. 115 ) The Rockefellers assigned their pub lic relations agent, Ivy Lee, to sell t he American pub lic the idea that the Bolsheviks were merely misund erstood idealists who were actually kind b enefactors of mankind. Professor Antony Sutton o f Stanford University's Hoov er Institution, no tes in h is highly authoritative Western Techno logy and Soviet Econo mi c Develop ment: \"Quite predictably, 180 pages later, Lee c oncludes that the c omm unist problem i s merely psychological. By this tim e he is talking abou t 'Russians' (not Comm unists) and concludes 'they are all right.' He suggests the United States s hou ld no t engage in propaganda; m akes a plea for peaceful coexistence; and suggests the United States would find it sound po licy to recognize the USS R and advance credits.\" (Antony Sutton, Western Techno logy and Soviet Econo mic Development, 1917 -1930, Hoov er Institution on War, Revolution and Peace , Stanford University, Calif., 196 8, p. 292 )"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"After the Bolshevik Revolution, Standard o f New Jersey bought 50 p er cent of the Nobel's huge Caucasus oil fields even thou gh the property had theoretically been nationalized. (O'Conno r, Harvey, The Empire Of Oil, Monthly Review Press, New York, 1955, p. 270. ) _ In 1927, Standard Oil of New Y ork bu ilt a refinery in Russia, thereby helping the Bolsheviks put their econo my back on its feet. Professor Sutton states: \"This was we first United States investm ent in Russia since the Revolution. \" (Ibid, Vol. 1, p. 38 ) Shortly thereafter Standard Oil of New Y ork and its s ubsidiary, Vacuum Oil Company, concluded a deal to market Soviet oil i n European coun tries and it was reported that a loan o f $75,000,000 to the Bolsheviks was arranged. (National Repub lic, Sept. 1927. ) We have been u nable to find ou t if Standard Oil was even theoretically expropriated by the Comm unists. Sutton writes: \"Only the Danish telegraph concessions, the Japanese fishing, coal and o il concessions, and the Standard Oil l ease remained after 1935 .\" (Ibid, Vol. II, p. 17. ) Wherever Standard Oil would go, Chase National Bank was s ure to follow. (The Rockefeller's Chase Bank was later merged with the Warburg's M anhattan Bank to form t he present Chase Manhattan Bank. ) In order to rescue the Bolsheviks, who were suppo sedly an archenemy, the Chase National Bank was instrumental in establishing the American-Russian Chamber of Comm erce in 1922. President of the Chamber was Reeve Schley, a vice-president of Chase National Bank. (Ibid, Vol. II, p. 2 88) According to Professor Sutton: \"In 1925, n egotiations between Chase a nd Prombank extended b eyond the finance of raw materials and mapped ou t a c omplete program for financing Soviet raw material exports to the U.S. and im ports of U.S. cotton and machinery. (Ibid, Vol. II, p. 226 ) Sutton also reports that \"Chase National Bank and the Equitable Trust Company were leaders in the Soviet credit business.\" (Ibid, p. 277 ) The Rockefeller's Chase Nation al Bank also was invo lved in selling Bolshevik bond s in the United States in 1928. Patriotic organizations denoun ced the Chase a s an \"international fence.\" Chase was called \"a disgrace to America. ...

According to Professor Sutton \"... there is a report in the State Departm ent files that names Kuhn, Loeb & Co.

Decim al File, 811.51 /3711 and 861.50 FIVE YEAR PLAN /236 .\" (Sutton, op. cit., Vol. II, p. 340n. ) Professor Sutton p roves conclusively in h is three volume history of Soviet techno logical development that the Soviet Union was alm ost lit erally manufactured by the U.S.A. Sutton quo tes a report by Averell Harrim an to the State Departm ent in June, 1944 as s tating: \"Stalin p aid tribute to the a ssistance rendered by the United States to Soviet indu stry before a nd du ring the war. He said that abou t two-thirds of all t he large industrial enterprise in the Soviet Union h ad b een bu ilt with United States help o r technical assistance.\" (Sutton, op. cit., Vol. II, p. 3. ) Remember that this was at a tim e when the Soviets had already established an extensive spy network in the U.S. and the Comm unist Daily Worker newspaper regularly called for the destruction o f our liberty and the Sovietizing of America. Sutton shows that there is hardly a segment of the Soviet econo my which is not a result of the transference of Western, p articularly American, techno log y. This canno t be wholly the result of accident. For fifty y ears the Federal Reserve-CFR- Rockefeller- Insider crowd h as advo cated and carried ou t policies aim ed at increasing the power of their satellit e, the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, America spends $75 b illi on a year on defense to p rotect it self fr om t he e nemy the Insiders are building up. What has been true of the past is even more valid today. The leader in p romoting the transfer of techno log y and increasing aid and trade with the Comm unists is the Coun cil on Foreign Relations. On October 7, 1966, President Lyndon John son, a man who h ad appo inted a C.F.R. member to v irtually every strategic position in h is admi nistration, stated: \"We intend to p ress for legislative a uthority to n egotiate trade agreements which could extend most-f avored-nation tariff treatm ent to European Comm unist states. ... We will reduce e xport controls on East-West trade with respect to hund reds of non - strategic items. ... \" The New Y ork Tim es reported on e week later on -October 13, 1966 : \"The United States put into effect today one of President John son's propo sals for stim ulating East-West trade by removing restrictions on the e xport of more than four hund red comm odities to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. . . . Among the ca tegories from which items have been selected for export relaxation are vegetables, cereals, fodder, hides, crude a nd manufactured rubb er, pu lp and waste"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"paper, textiles and textile fibers, crude fertili zers, metal ores and scrap, petroleum, gas and d erivatives, chemi cal compound s and p rodu cts, dyes, medicines, fireworks, detergents, plastic materials, metal produ cts and machinery, and scientific and professional instruments.\" Virtually every one of these \"non -strategic\" items has a direct or indirect use in war. Later, items s uch as rifle c leaning compound s, electronic e quipment and radar were declared \"non-strategic\" and cleared for shipment to the Soviet Union. The trick sim ply is to d eclare a lm ost everything \"non-strategic.\" A machine gun is s till considered strategic a nd therefore may not be shipped to the Comm unists, bu t the tools for making the machine guns and the c hemi cals to p ropel the bullets have been declared \"non-strategic.\" Meanwhile, nearly 50,0 00 Americans have died in Vietnam. The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese receive 85 percent of their war materials from Russia a nd the Soviet bloc nations. Since their economi es are incapable of suppo rting a war, the Comm unist arm of the c onspiracy needed h elp from t he Finance Capitalist arm. The United States has been financing and equipping both sides of the terrible Vietnamese war, killi ng our own soldiers by proxy. Again, the landscape painters in the mass media have kept the American pub lic from l earning this provable fact. Not surprisingly, the Rockefellers have been leaders in championing this bloody trade. On January 16, 1 967, on e of the most incredible a rticles ever to appear in a newspaper graced the front page of the Establishment's daily, the New Y ork Tim es. Under the headline \"Eaton Joins Rockefellers To Spur Trade With Reds\" the a rticle stated: \"An alliance of fami ly fortunes linking Wall Street and the Midwest is going to try to build econo mi c bridges between the free world and Comm unist Europe. The International Basic Econo my Corporation, controlled by the Rockefeller brothers, and Tower International, Inc., h eaded by Cyrus S. Eaton Jr., Cleveland financier, plan to coop erate in promoting trade between the Iron Curtain coun tries, including the Soviet Union. ... \" International Basic Economy Corporation (IBEC) is run by Richard Aldrich, grandson of Federal Reserve plotter Nelson Aldrich, and Rodman Rockefeller (CFR), Rocky's son. On October 20, 19 69, IBEC annou nced that N. M. Rothschild & Sons of London had entered into p artnership with the firm. Cyrus Eaton Jr. is the son o f the notoriously pro-Soviet Cyrus Eaton, who began h is career as s ecretary to John D. Rockefeller. It is believed that Eaton's rise to po wer in finance resulted from backing by his mentor. The a greement between Tower International and IBEC continues an o ld alliance. Althou gh Eaton's name does not appear on the CFR's membership rolls, the Reec e Committ ee which investigated found ations for Congress in 1953, found that Eaton was a secret m ember. Amon g the \"non -strategic\" items which the Rockefeller-Eaton axis is going to bu ild for the Comm unists are ten rubb er good s plants, including two synthetic rubber plants worth $200 milli on. Mr. Eaton explains in the Times article: \"These people a re setting up n ew automobile plants and kno w they have got to h ave tire factories.\" Under the Nixon Admi nistration which, contrary to campaign p romi ses, has multiplied trade"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"with the Reds tenfold, American concerns are building the world's largest track factory for the Comm unists.

Here Nikita Khrushchev greets the avowedly pro- Comm unist indu strialist Cyrus Eaton. Eaton started h is Business career as secretary to John D. Rockefeller and the Rocke feller family is believe d to b e largely respon sible for his fortune. Even more incredibly, the Tim es reveals: \"Last m onth, Tower International reached a tentative agreement with the Soviet patent and licensing organization, Licensintorg, covering future licensing and patent transactions. Until now, Mr. Eaton said, the Russians have left the buying and selling of licenses and patents to the Amt org Trading Corporation, the official Soviet agency in this coun try for promoting Soviet-American trade.\" This means that the Rockefellers and Eatons have a monopo ly on the transfer of techno logical capability to the suppo sed enemi es of the super-rich, the Soviet Union. According to the Tim es: \"Mr. Eaton ackno wledged the difficulties that Amt org's representatives had encoun tered h ere in trying to arrange licensing agreements with American companies. 'As you can im agine,' he said, 'it i s alm ost im possible for a Russian to walk into the research d epartm ent of an American aerospace c ompany and try to arrange the purchase of a patent'.\" Certainly every loyal American will say to h im self, \"Well, I would hop e to God the Soviets couldn't walk into ou r defense plants and b uy a patent.\" The Rockefellers and the Eatons have solved that problem for the Communists. Now, instead o f dealing with an o fficial agency of the Soviet government, American concerns will be dealing with the Rockefellers. Meanwhile, nearly 50,000 Americans have died in Vietnam, many of them killed by weapon s which the Rockefellers directly or indirectly supp lied to ou r avowed enemi es. Only the technicality of the lack o f a formal declaration o f war prevents the Rockefellers' trading in the blood o f dead Americans from being actionable a s treason. Thus by the purchase of patents for the Comm unists the Rockefellers are virtually in charge of research and development for the Soviet milit ary machine, allowing the Soviets to mass produ ce American developments. The transfer of such kn owledge is even more im portant than the sale of weapon s. A process that m ay have taken an American corporation a deca de to d evelop is transferred in toto to the Comm unists. Does it m ake sense to spend $75 b illi on a year on n ational defense a nd then deliberately increase the war- making po tential of an avowed enemy? It does to Mr. Rockefeller and the Insiders. Since the Rockefellers have c ontracted to arrange for patents for the Soviets, they are by dictionary definition Comm unist agents. Would it not be more acc urate to d efine the Comm un ists as Rockefeller agents? Indicative of this was a strange e vent which o ccurred in October of 1964. David Rockefeller, president of the Chase Manhattan Bank and chairman of the board o f the Coun cil on Foreign Relations, took a vaca tion in the Soviet Union. This is a peculiar place for the world's greatest \"im perialist\" to take his vaca tion since much o f"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Comm unist propaganda deals with taking all of David's wealth away from him and distributing it t o \"the people.\" A few days after Rockefeller ended h is \"vacation\" in the Kremli n, Nikita Khrushchev was recalled from a vacation at a Black Sea resort to learn that he had b een fired. How strange! As far as the world kn ew, Khrushchev was the a bsolute dictator of the Soviet government and, more im portant, head o f the Comm unist Party which runs the USS R. Who h as the power to fire the man who was suppo sedly the a bsolute dictator? Did David Rockefeller journey to the Soviet Union to fire a n employee? Obviously the position o f premi er in the Soviet Union is a figurehead with the true power residing elsewhere. Perhaps in New Y ork. For five decades the Comm unists have based their propaganda on the theme that they were going to d estroy the Rockefellers and the other super-r ich. Yet we find that for five decades the Rockefellers have been invo lved in bu ilding the strength of the Soviets. We a re suppo sed to b elieve those international cartelists do this beca use they are foolish o r greedy. Does this make sense? If a crimi nal goes up and do wn the streets s hou ting at the top of his lungs that as s oon as he gets hold o f a gun he is going to k ill Joe Doaks, and you learn that Doaks is s ecretly giving g uns to the c rimi nal, on e of two things must be true. Either Doaks is a fool or all t he shou ting is just \"show biz\" and the c rimi nal secretly works for Doaks. The Rockefellers are not fools. While David runs the financial end o f the Rockefeller dynasty, Nelson runs the politi cal. Nelson would like to b e President of the United States. But, un fortunately for him , he is unacceptable to the vast m ajority of the grass roots of his own p arty. The next best thing to b eing President is controlling a President. Nelson Rockefeller and Richard Nixon are suppo sed to b e bitter politi cal competitors. In a sense they are, but that still does not preclude Rockefeller from asserting domi nion ov er Mr. Nixon. When Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller competed for the Repub lican no mi nation in 1968, Rockefeller naturally would h ave preferred to win the prize, bu t regardless of who won, h e would control the highest office in the land. You will reca ll t hat right in the mi ddle of drawing up the Repub lican p latform i n 1960, Mr. Nixon sudd enly left Chicago and flew to New Y ork to meet with Nelson Rockefeller in what Barry Goldwater described as the \"Munich o f the Republi can Party.'\" There was no po liti cal reason why Mr. Nixon n eeded to crawl to Mr. Rockefeller. He had the conv ention all sewed up. The Chicago Tribun e c racked that it was like Grant surrendering to Lee.

A single night's meeting of the two men in a milli onaire's triplex apartm ent in Babylon -by-the-Hudson, eight hund red and thirty mil es away, was about to overrule them; t hey were exposed as clowns for all the world to see.\" The whole story behind what happened in Rockefeller's apartm ent will doub tless never be known. We ca n on ly make a n educated gu ess in light of subsequent events. But it i s obv ious that since that tim e Mr. Nixon h as been in the Rockefeller orbit. After losing to Kennedy by an eyelash, Mr. Nixon, against his wishes, and at the request (or order) of Rockefeller, entered the California gubernatorial race a nd lost. (For further details s ee the a uthor's Richard Nixon: The Man Behind The Mask.) After losing to Pat Brown in the California gubernatorial race in 1962, Nixon h ad universally been consigned to the politi cal trash h eap. He left his practice as an attorney in California a nd went to New Y ork, where he moved in as a neighbo r of Nelson Rockefeller, the man who is s uppo sedly his archenemy, in a $100 ,000 -a-year apartm ent in a building owned by Rockefeller. Then Mr. Nixon went to work for the law firm of Mr. Rockefeller's personal attorney, John Mitchell, and in the next six years s pent m ost of his tim e touring the c oun try and the world, first rebuilding his politi cal reputation and then campaigning to get the 1968 Repub lican no mination. At the same tim e, according to h is own financial statement, his net worth multiplied many tim es and he became quite wealthy. Nelson Rockefeller, (and h is colleagues of the Eastern Liberal Establishment), who h elped make Nixon acce ptable to Conservatives by appearing to oppo se him , rescued Nixon from politi cal oblivion and made him President of the United States. Does it not m ake sense that Mr. Nixon, the man o f passionate a mbition whose c areer had sunk to the bottom, had to make some deals in o rder to reach h is goal? And d id h e not acquire massive politi cal debts in return for being made President by the Eastern Liberal Establishment? When Nixon left Washington, h e, by his own claim , had littl e more than an o ld Oldsmobile a utomobile, Pat's respectable Repub lican cloth coat, and a government pension. While in law practice Nixon h ad an income of $200,000 p er year, of which more than h alf went to p ay for the a partm ent in Rocky's building. By 196 8, he reported h is net worth as $515,830, while a ssigning a value of only $45,00 0 to h is partnership in h is increasingly flourishing law firm. It m ay be that the frugal Mr. Nixon acquired the a fter-tax investm ent capital that m ushroomed into $858,190 in assets by faithfully plugging his change into a piggy bank. Then again, it m ay have been p art of Nixon's deal with Rockefeller and the Insiders that Mr. Nixon's personal pov erty problems s hou ld b e solved. The President is obv iously an un -free agent. The man most observers agree is the most powerful m an in the Admi nistration on domestic policy matters is Attorney General John Mitchell. Mitchell, who h ad b een a Nixon law partner, served as campaign manager in 1968, and reportedly will serve in that capacity in 1972. The Wall Street Journal of January 17, 1969, revealed that Mitchell was Rocky's personal lawyer.

Richard Nixon was elected President on a platform which p romi sed to stop America's retreat before world Communism.

Is it surprising then that Mr. Nixon h as don e just the oppo site of what he promi sed h e would do du ring his 1968 campaign? How did Mr. Nixon come to p ick an u ltra-liberal to b e his number one foreign po licy advisor? We a re told by Tim e magazine that Mr. Nixon met Kissinger at a cocktail party given by Clare Boothe Luce during the Christm as holidays in 1967. Mr. Nixon is s uppo sed to h ave been so im pressed by Dr. Kissinger's cocktail party repartee that he a ppo inted h im t o the most powerful position in the Nixon Admi nistration. Mr. Nixon would h ave to b e stupid to h ave don e that; and Mr. Nixon is not stupid. The Kissinger appo intm ent was arranged by Nelson Rockefeller. (Salt Lake City Desert News, March 27, 1970. ) Kissinger had served for five years as Rockefeller's personal advisor on foreign affairs and at the tim e of his appointm ent he was s erving as a paid staff member of the Council on Foreign Relati ons. Mr. Nixon's fantastic a bout face was praised by LBJ in the Washington Star of Dec. 1, 1971. The paper states: \"Former President Lyndon B.

Unfortunately, this picture is twenty y ears out of date. The very liberal Senator Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania boasted to a reporter one day: \"[Liberals] get the ac tion and the Conservatives get the rhetoric.\" Richard Nixon could no t have been elected h ad h e run as a Rockefeller liberal, bu t he ca n g et away with runn ing his Admi nistration like one simply because the landscape painters fail t o call t he pub lic's attention to the fact. However, columnist Stewart Alsop in writing for a soph isticated audience of approving Liberals, reveals the real Nixon. Alsop claim s that if Nixon were judged by his deeds instead o f his ancient image, the Liberals' attit ude toward h im would b e different. If only the Liberals' Pavlovian respon se to the Nixon n ame c ould b e e limi nated, says Alsop, they would realize how far Left he is. Therefore Alsop substitutes a hypothetical \"President Liberal\" for President Nixon: \"... If President Liberal were actually in the White House, it i s not at all hard to im agine the reaction to h is program. The right would b e a ssailing President Liberal for bugging out of Vietnam, und ermi ning American d efenses, fiscal irresponsibility, and g alloping socialism. The four basic Presidential po licy positions listed abov e would b e greeted with ho sannas by the liberals. ... Instead, the liberals have showered the President with d ead cats, while most conservatives have maintained a glum silence, and thus the Admi nistration h as been 'littl e c redited' for 'much genuine ac hievement.' But there a re certain special reasons, which Pat Moynihan o mitted to mention, why this is s o.\" Alsop further explains how having the reputation of being an enemy of the Liberal Democrats helps Nixon pass their program: \"For one thing, there is a sort of unconscious conspiracy between the President and his natural enemi es, the liberal Democrats, to concea l the e xtent to which h is basic program, leaving aside frills and rhetoric, is really the liberal Democratic program. Richard Nixon is the first professional politi cian and 'real Repub lican' to be elected President in 40 years -and it i s not in the self- interest of the liberals to give c redit t o such a President for liberal initiatives. By the same token, it i s not in the self- interest of the President to risk h is conservative c onstituency by encouraging the notion that he is not a 'real Repub lican' after all, bu t a liberal Democrat at cut rates. . . . There a re plenty of examples of the mutual obfuscation which results from t his mutual interest. The withdrawal of half a milli on men from Vietnam i s quite obv iously the greatest retreat in American h istory. But the President talks as thou gh it were somehow a glorious advance, certain to guarantee a 'just and lasting peace.' When the President-like a ny comm ander of a retreat-resorts to spoiling actions to protect his dwindling rear guard, the liberals howl that he is 'chasing the will-o'-the- wisp o f milit ary victory.' ...

There is also a human element in this exercise in mutual obfuscation. To the liberals, especially the liberal comm entators who domi nate the media, Richard Nixon is Dr. Fell ('The reason why I canno t tell, bu t this I kno w and kno w full well, I do no t like thee, Dr. Fell.'). This is not surprising. Not too many y ears ago, Richard M.

Those who vo ted for Nixon shou ldn't be quite so h appy. If you liked the Richard Nixon who ran for the Presidency, then you cannot, if you are c onsistent, like the Richard Nixon who is President. Nixon and h is fellow moderates\" have turned the Repub lican elephant into a donk ey in elephant's clothing. On June 19, 1959, Vice President Nixon gloated: \"In summ ary, the Repub lican admi nistration p rodu ced the things that the Democrats promi sed.\" It look s as if it's happening again! A year and a half earlier Nixon h ad been warbling a different tune: \"If we have nothing to offer other than a pale carbon copy of the New D eal, if our only purpose is to gain and retain po wer, the Republican Party no longer has any reason to exist, and it ought to go ou t of business.\" The Nixon \"Game Plan,\" as Harvard Professor John Kenneth Galbraith gleefully points ou t, is SOCIALISM. The Nixon \"Game Plan\" is infinitely more c lever and dangerous than those of his predecessors because it m asquerades as being the oppo site of what it i s. Mr. Nixon is aware that m ost Americans fear \"big g overnment.\" An August 1968, Gallup Poll showed that 46 p er cent of the American pub lic believed that \"big government\" was the \"biggest threat to the c oun try.\" Gallup comm ented: \"Althou gh big g overnment has been a favorite Repub lican target for many y ears, rank and file democrats are nearly as critical of growing Federal power as are Repub licans.\" Recognizing this attit ude, Mr. Nixon geared much of his campaign rhetoric to"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"attacking Big Daddy government. However, the Nixon Admi nistration h as taken massive steps to further concentrate a uthority in the federal \"power pinnacle.\" (See Chart 3, p. 34 ) While ce ntralizing power at a rate which would h ave made Hubert Humphrey blush, Mr. Nixon h as continued to p ay lip service to d ecentralization. During the first year of his Admi nistration Mr. Nixon announ ced h is \"New Federalism\" (the name taken from the titl e of a book by Nelson Rockefeller). The first part of the \"New Federalism\" is the Fami ly Assistance Program (FAP) which would, contrary to h is campaign promi ses, provide a Guaranteed Annual Income. Based on suggestions from John Gardner of the C.F.R. and Daniel Moynihan, a member of the board o f directors of the socialist ADA , the FAP would doub le the number on welfare a nd increase tremendou sly the power of the e xecutive branch of the federal government. The Leftwing weekly, the New Repub lic, cheered the propo sal as \"creeping socialism.\" The second major segment of the President's \"New Federalism\" is revenue sharing with the states, touted as a step h i the decentralization o f power from t he federal government. Actually, the program does just the oppo site. The money must first go from t he states to Washington b efore it can b e shared. As columnist James J . Kilpatrick remarked: \"... po wer to control follows the Federal dollar as s urely as that famous lamb accompanied littl e Mary.\" As s oon as the states and local governments get hoo ked on the federal fund s, the c ontrols will be put on just as they were in education and agriculture. Every field the government attempts to take over it first subsidizes. You can't decentralize government by centralizing the tax collections. Mr. Nixon's \"power to the people\" slogan really means \"power to the President.\" House Wa ys and Means Chairman Wilbur Mills has called the revenue-sharing plan a \"trap\" that \"could b ecome a massive weapon against the independence of state a nd local government.\" The plan, said Mills, \"goes in the direction o f centralized government.\" But, Mr. Nixon is very clever. In h is 1971 State of the Union Message, the talk in which h e used the Communist slogan \"Power to the People,\" the President said: \"We in Washington will at last be a ble to p rovide government that is truly for the people. I realize that what I am asking is that not only the Executive branch in Washington, bu t that even this Congress will have to change by giving up some of its power.\" That sound s reasonable doesn't it ? The Executive branch will give up some power and the Congress will give up some power and the people will gain by having these powers returned to them. Right? Wrong! That is nothing but verbal sleight of hand. Notice the precision o f Mr. Nixon's language. He speaks of the \"Executive branch in Washington\" giving up some of its power. Three days later it became obv ious why Mr. Nixon added the seemi ngly redund ant \"in Wa shington\" when it was announ ced that the c oun try was being carved up into ten federal districts. These federal districts would soon b e used to admi nister the wage a nd price c ontrols which centralize in the federal government alm ost total power over the e cono my."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"To many politi cal observers the most shocking development of the past year was the admi ssion by President Richard Nixon to n ewsman Howard K.

Smit h was well aware that such a statement was tantamoun t to a declaration by Mr. Nixon that \"I am now a Socialist.\" John Maynard Keynes, the English econo mi st and Fabian Socialist, bragged that he was promoting the \"euthanasia of capitalism.\" It is generally believed in England among students of this conspiracy that John Maynard Keynes produced h is General Theory of Money and Credit at the behest of certain Insiders of international finance who h ired him t o concoct a pseudo-scientific justification for government deficit spending-just as the mysterious League of Just Men h ad h ired Karl Marx to write the Comm unist Manifesto. The farther a government goes into d ebt, the more interest is paid to the powerful Insiders who \"create\" money to b uy government bond s by the sim ple e xpedient of bookk eeping entries. Otherwise, you can b et your last farthing that the Insiders of internation al banking would be violently oppo sed to inflationary deficits. In h is internationally syndicated column o f February 3, 1971, James Reston (C.F.R.) exclaim ed: \"The Nixon bud get is s o complex, so un like the Nixon o f the past, so un -Repub lican that it defies rational analysis. ... The Nixon budg et is more planned, h as more welfare in it, and h as a bigger predicted d eficit t han any other budget of this century.\" During 1967, while on the prim ary trail, Richard Nixon made e xorbitant Democrat spending his Number Two campaign issue, just behind the failure of the Democrats to win the Vietnam War. Mr. John son's 1967 Budget was $158.6 b illi on, which at the tim e seemed astrono mi cal. Mr. Nixon claim ed that if that amoun t were not sliced by $10 b illi on the c oun try face d financial disaster. At a tim e when the Vietnam War was a far bigger financial drain than it i s now, Richard Nixon argued that we should b e spending around $150 b illi on. President Nixon is now spending $230 b illi on, and b ills already introduced in Congress and likely to p ass could pu sh the 1972 Fiscal Budget (July 1, 1971 to July 1, 1972 ) to $250 b illi on. The point is that the man who campaigned as M r. Frugal in 1968 is, in h is third year of office, ou t-spending by $80 to $100 b illi on what he said h is predecessor shou ld spend. And some e xperts are predicting that Mr. Nixon could spend as much as $275 billi on n ext year. This is the same Richard Nixon who in Dallas on October 11, 1968, declared that \"America canno t afford four years of Hubert Humphrey in the White House\" beca use he had advocated p rograms which would h ave caused \"a spending spree that would have bankrupted this nation. \" Candidate Nixon flayed the John son Admi nistration for failing \"to cut deficit spending which is the cause of our present inflation. \" Budget deficits, he said, \"lie a t the heart of our troub les.\" For his own p art, he renounced any \"massive step-up\" in federal spending. \"This is a prescription for further inflation, \" said Nixon. \"I believe it i s also a prescription for econo mi c disaster.\""},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"While it t ook LBJ five years to run up a $55 b illi on d eficit, Senator Harry Byrd no tes that the acc umulated deficit for Mr. Nixon's first three years will reach at least $88 billi on.

In order to h alt i nflation Mr. Nixon h as now instituted wage a nd p rice c ontrols. Most Americans, sick of seeing their paychecks s hrink in pu rchasing power each month, have overwhelmi ngly approved. But this is because most people a re not aware of the real causes of inflation. And you can b e sure that the Establishment's landscape painters will not explain the truth to them. The truth is that there is a difference between inflation' and the wage-price spiral. When the government runs a deficit, brand n ew money in the a moun t of the deficit i s put into circulation. As the new money percolates through the ec ono my it bids up wages and prices. This is easy to und erstand if you think o f ou r econo my as a giant auction. Just as at any other auction, if the bidders are sudd enly supp lied with more money, they will use that money to b id up p rices. Inflation, in reality, is an increase in the supp ly of money. It causes the wage-price spiral which is generally mi slabeled inflation. You could no t have a wage price spiral if you d id no t have a n increase in the money supp ly with which to p ay it. This is not just econo mi cs, it i s physics. You can't fill a quart bottle with a pint of mil k. To say that the wage-price spiral causes inflation is like saying wet streets cause rain. Mr. Nixon, un like the vast m ajority of the American pub lic, is aware of the real causes of \"inflation.\" He e xplained it clearly on January 27, 1970 : \"The inflation we have a t the start of the Seventies was caused by heavy deficit spending in the Sixties. In the past deca de, the Federal Government spent m ore than it took in-$57 b illi on more. These deficits caused prices to rise 25 p ercent in a deca de.\" Business blames \"inflation\" on the unions, and un ions blame \"inflation\" on bu siness, but only the government can cause \"inflation. \" Mr. Nixon h as fastened wage a nd price c ontrols on the ec ono my suppo sedly to solve a problem which Mr. Nixon (and LBJ) created by runn ing huge deficits. If he sincerely wanted to stop \"inflation\" he would h ave put wage a nd p rice c ontrols on the government rather than on the rest of us and would h ave stopp ed d eficit spending. People a re c heering Nixon b eca use he \"did something.\" This is akin to cheering for a motorist who shoo ts a pedestrian h e has just run over. Wage a nd p rice c ontrols are a t the very heart of Socialism. You can't have a totalitarian government withou t wage a nd p rice controls and you can't have a free coun try with them. Why? You canno t im pose slavery upon p eople who h ave econo mi c freedom. As long as people have ec onomi c freedom, they will be free. Wage a nd p rice c ontrols are people c ontrols. In h is Phase II speech, Mr. Nixon made it clear that the 90 -day wage a nd p rice c ontrols are with u s in on e disguise or another from now on. They are a major step towards establishing an all-powerful Executive branch o f the federal government. After the Insiders have e stablished the United Socialist States of America (in fact if not in n ame), the next step is the Great Merger of all nations of the world into a dictatorial world government.

In 19 15, in No. 40 o f the Russian o rgan, The Socialist Democrat, Lenin propo sed a \"United States of the World.\" The program of the Comm unist International of 1936 says that world dictatorship \"can b e e stablished on ly by victory of socialism i n d ifferent coun tries or group s of coun tries, after which the Proletariat Repub lics would un ite on federal li nes with those a lready in existence, and this system would expand ... at length formi ng the world un ion o f Soviet Socialist Repub lics.\" One of the most im portant group s promoting the \"world un ion\" is the United World Federalists, whose membership is heavily interlocked with that of the Coun cil on Foreign Relations. The UWF advo cate turning the UN into a full-f ledged world government which would include the Comm unist nations. Richard Nixon is, of course, far too clever to actually join the UWF, bu t he has suppo rted their legislative program since his early days in Congress. In the October 1948 issue of the UWF publication World Government News, on p age 14, there appears the following announ cement: \"Richard Nixon: Introdu ced world gov ernment resoluti on (HCR 68) 1947, and ABC (World Government) resolution 1948. \" World government has a strong emotional appeal for Americans, based on their universal desire for world p eace. The Insiders have the Comm unists rattli ng their sabers with on e hand and dangling the olive branch with the other. Naturally everyone gravitates towards the olive branch, no t realizing that the olive branch is controlled by another arm of the e ntity that is rattli ng the sabers. In September of 1968, candidates for pub lic office rece ived a letter fr om t he United World Federalists that stated: \"Our organization h as been endo rsed and comm ended by all U.S. presidents in the last 20 years and by the c urrent nomi nees for the presidency.

A w orld government requires a world supreme c ourt, and Mr. Nixon is on record in favor of a world supreme court.

Under an imm ense geodetic dome a t Southern Illinois University is a c ompletely detailed map o f the world which o ccupies the space of three football fields. Operating und er grants from t he Ford, Carnegie a nd Rockefeller foundations (all extensively interlocked with the C.F.R.) a battery of scientists including everything from geographers, psychologists and behavioral scientists to n atural scientists, biologists, biochemi sts and agrono mi sts are making plans to control people. These e lite planners conduct exercises in what they call \"the world game.\" For example: There a re too many people in Coun try A and no t enough p eople in Coun try B. How do you move people from Coun try A to Coun try B? We need so many males, so many females, so many of this occupation and so many of that occupation, so many of this age a nd so many of that age. How do you get these people from Coun try A and settle them i n Coun try B in the shortest possible tim e? Another example: We have a n up rising in Coun try C (or as it would no w be ca lled, District C) How long does it take to send in \"peace\" forces to stop the insurgency? The World Game people run exercises on global control. If you p lan on running the world, you canno t go about it haphazardly. That is why the Insiders of the Ford, Carnegie a nd Rockefeller found ations are making these plans. The real name of the game is 1984. We will have systematic popu lation reduction, forced sterilization o r anything else which the planners deem necessary to establish absolute c ontrol in their humanitarian Utopia. But to enforce these plans, you must have a n all-powerful world government. You can't do this if individual nations have sovereignty.

These group s chant that if we don't \"change\" America, we will l ose it. \"Change\" is a word we hear over and over. By \"change\" these group s mean Socialism. Virtually all members of these group s sincerely believe that they are fighting the Establishment. In reality they are a n indispensible a lly of the Establishment in fastening Socialism on all of us. The naive radicals think that und er Socialism t he \"people\" will run everything. Actually, it will be a clique of Insiders in total control, consolidating and controlling all wealth. That is why these schoo lboy Lenins and teenage Trotskys are a llowed to roam free a nd are practically never arrested o r prosecuted. They are protected. If the Establishment wanted the revolutionaries s topp ed, ho w long do you think they would be tolerated? Chart 9 Instead, we find that m ost of these radicals are the recipients of largesse from m ajor found ations or are receiving money from t he government through the War on Poverty. The Rothschild-Rockefeller- C.F.R. Insiders at the top \"surrender to the demands\" for Socialism from t he mobs below. The radicals are doing the work o f those whom t hey hate the most. Remember Bakun in's charge that Marx' followers had on e foot in the bank and the other in the Socialist m ovement. Further indications of Establishment financing of the Comm unist S.D.S. are c ontained in James Kunen's The Strawberry Statement: Notes of A College Revolutionary. Describing events at the 1968 S.D.S. national conv ention, Kunen says: \"Also at the conv ention, men from Business International Round tables-the meetings spon sored by Business International for their client group s and heads of government- tried to b uy up a few radicals.

The only way McCarthy could win is if the c razies and young radicals act up and make Gene look more reasonable. They offered to finance our demonstrations in Chicago. We were a lso o ffered Esso (Rockefeller) money. They want us to make a lot of radical comm otion so they can look more in the center as they move to the left.\" THA T IS THE STRATEGY . THE LANDSCAPE PAINTERS FOCUS YOUR ATTE NTION ON THE KIDS IN THE STREET WHILE T HE REAL DANG ER IS FROM ABOV E. As Frank Capell recently observed in The Review Of The News: \"Of course, we kno w that these radical students are not going to take over the government. What they are going to do is provide the e xcuse for the government to take over the people, by passing more a nd more repressive laws to 'keep things und er control.'\" The radicals make a commotion in the streets while the Lim ousine Liberals at the top in New Y ork and Washington are Socializing us. WE ARE GOING TO HAV E A DICTATORSHIP OF THE ELITE DISGU ISED A S A DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLET ARIAT. Now the Insiders of the Establishment are moving into a more soph isticated method of applying pressure from below. John Gardner, a \"Repub lican\" and member of the C.F.R., h as established a grass roots proletarian o rganization called Common Cause. This may become the biggest and most im portant organization in American history. Comm on Cause's goal is to o rganize welfare recipients, those who h ave not voted before, and Liberals to lobby for Socialism. That lobbying will not only be e xpressed in p ressuring Congress to p ass Socialist legislation bu t will also b e e xpressed as ballot power in elections. Comm on Cause is s uppo sedly the e pitome of anti- Establishmentarianism, bu t who is paying the bills? The e lite Insider radicals from abov e. The number one bankroller of this group to ov erthrow the super-r ich and re- distribute their wealth among the poo r is John D. Rockefeller II I. Other key financiers are Andrew Heiskell (CFR), chairman o f the board o f Tim e, Inc., Thomas Watson (CFR), chairman o f the board o f IBM, John Whitney (CFR) of the Standard Oil fortune, Sol Linowitz (CFR), chairman o f the board o f Xerox, and Gardner Cowles (CFR) of Cowles pub lications. In any organization, the man who p ays the bills is the boss. The others are his employees. What better proof could we have that Socialism i s not a movement of downtrodd en masses but of power hungry eliti sts? The poo r are merely pawns in the game.

After reading this book, some will bemoan the fact that the situation is hop eless. These will be many of the same people who, b efore reading this book, really did no t believe the problems facing us were serious. Some people wake up and give up in the same week. This is, of course, just exactly what the Insiders want you to do. The c onspiracy can be defeated. The Insiders are not omnipotent. It is true that they control im portant parts of the federal government, high finance a nd the mass media. But they do no t control everything, or the vise would already have been closed. We mi ght say the c onspiracy controls everything but you. You are their Achilles heel if you are willi ng to fight. There is an o ld cliche in sports that quitters never win and winners never quit.

But the Insiders are vulnerable to an end run. You, and thou sands of others like you can make a n end run if you want to. It is our intention in this closing chapter to show w hy it can b e done a nd ho w you can do it. The timi ng for an end run h as never been better. What Barry Goldwater said in 1964, people were willi ng to b elieve in 1968. Most people who vo ted for Nixon d id so beca use he promi sed to balance the budget, no t establish wage a nd price c ontrols; slash government spending, no t m ultiply it; cut welfare, no t push for a guaranteed annu al income; stand firm against the Comm unists, no t lead the Red Chinese into the U. N.; build America's defenses, no t continue to unilaterally disarm us; and stop aid and trade with ou r avowed Comm unist enemi es, not doub le it. These were the issues which suppo sedly differentiated Nixon from Humphrey. Now we see that Nixon h as repud iated h is own p romises and carried ou t those of his oppon ent. By 1972, milli ons of Americans will have concluded that there is littl e difference between the leadership of the two major parties. And more a nd more people a re beginning to realize that there is a tiny clique of conspirators at the top which controls both the Democrat and Repub lican Parties. The one thing these c onspirators canno t survive is exposure. The Insiders are succe ssful only because so few of their victim s kno w w hat is being planned and ho w Insiders are c arrying out those plans. Conspiracies can op erate only in the dark. They canno t stand the truthful li ght of day. Once a ny sizeable mi nority of the American people becomes aware of the c onspiracy and what it is up to, the many decades of patient planning and work by the Insiders in this coun try can b e destroyed in an amazingly short period of tim e. This job is largely a matter of getting others to realize that they have been conn ed and are c ontinuing to b e c onned. You must become the local arm of the world's largest floating university. But before you ca n go to work, po inting out these c onspiratorial facts to o thers, you must kno w the facts yourself. This book is designed to give you these facts, and can be your greatest tool.

The c oncept of an army of individuals which is dedicated to exposing \"the c onspiracy\" frightens the Insiders because it works outside the c hannels which they con trol. Richard Nixon h as s aid o f the Repub lican Party: \"We've got to h ave a tent everyone can get into.\" The Democrats have obv iously believed that for a long tim e. But a Party must be based on p rinciples or it has no justification for existence. Bringing Socialists into the Repub lican Party theoretically may broaden the base, bu t, in reality, serves only to d isfranchise those who b elieve in a Constitutional Repub lic a nd the free enterprise system. In 1972, the Repub licans will t ry to make you forget that Richard Nixon was elected on George Wallace's platform but has been carrying out Hubert Humphrey's. The pitch will be \"party unity.\" \"If not Nixon then who?\" will be the typical response to complaints abou t Nixon's actions. But unity with evil i s evil. During the campaign o f 1972, Nixon will again talk conservatively while the C.F.R.'s Democrat candidate will sound frighteningly radical in o rder to stampede you into acce pting Nixon as the lesser of two evils. The Establishment m ay even run its John Lindsay or Eugene McCarthy as a far Left third o r fourth p arty candidate in o rder to split t he Democratic Party and re-elect Richard Nixon with a c omparatively small number of votes. It is only logical that the Insiders will t ry to apply the c oup d e grace against America through a Repub lican President sim ply beca use most people ca nno t believe that a Repub lican could b e \"soft on Comm unism\" or would jeopardize our liberty or sovereignty. The watchdogs tend to go to sleep with a Repub lican in o ffice. Democrats and Repub licans must break the Insider control of their respective parties. The C.F.R.-types and their flunk ies and social climbing oppo rtunist suppo rters must be invited to leave or else the Patriots must leave. It is up to you to pu t the politi cians on the spot and make the C.F.K.-Insiders a campaign issue. This can be a ccomplished easily by creating the base of thinking that will oppo se their positions. The Socialists must be forced to g ather into on e party. The conspiracy doesn't want the resultant clear distinction b etween p arty ideologies. The Insiders want the issues between the parties to b e cloudy and g ray, centering on personaliti es, no t principles. Neither party can come out strongly against Socialism as long as it i s pushing Socialist programs. But that is the way the Insiders want it . The issue, very sim ply, is the e nslavement of you and your children. Just beca use many of these Insiders are theoretically Americans, don 't think they will spare this coun try the terror they have brought to thirty others through their hired Comm unist thugs. To the Insiders, the world is their coun try and their only loyalty is to themselves and their fellow conspirators. Being an American means no more to them than b eing an hono rary citizen o f Bali would mean to you. It has not bothered their consciences one iota that milli ons of your fellow human b eings have been murdered, including 50,000 o f your own sons in Vietnam. In o rder to solidify their power in the United States they will need to do h ere the same thing they have don e in o ther coun tries. They will establish and maintain their dictatorship through stark terror. The terror does not end with the c omplete takeover of the Repub lic.

What can we e xpect from t he c onspiracy during the next few years? Here a re fourteen signpo sts on the road to totalitarianism compiled some years ago by historian Dr. Warren Carroll and a refugee from Yugoslavian Comm unism, Mike Djordjevich. The list is not in any particular order nor is the order of any particular significance a s given here. But the im position o f any one of these new restrictions on liberty (none of which was in effect when the list was compiled) would b e a c lear warning that the totalitarian state is very near; and o nce a significant number of them-perhaps five has been im posed, we ca n rationally conclude that the remainder would no t be far behind and that the fight for freedom and the preservation of the Repub lic has been lost in this coun try. Fourteen S ignp osts To Slavery 1. Restrictions on taking money out of the c oun try and on the e stablishment or retention o f a foreign b ank acc oun t by an American citizen. 2. Aboliti on o f private ownership o f hand guns. 3. Detention o f individuals withou t judicial process. 4. Requirements that private financial transactions be keyed to social security numbers or other government identification so that government records of these transactions can be kept and fed into a c omputer. 5. Use of compulsory education laws to forbid attendance a t presently existing private schoo ls. 6. Compulsory non -milit ary service. 7. Compulsory psychological treatm ent for nongovernment workers or public schoo l children. 8. An o fficial declaration that anti-Comm unist organizations are subv ersive and subsequent legal action taken to supp ress them. 9. Laws limiti ng the number of people a llowed to meet in a private home. 10. Any significant change in passport regulations to make passports more difficult t o obtain o r use. 11.

As you are no doub t aware President Nixon already has invo ked nu mbers 1, 11 and 14. Steps 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 12 and 13 already have been p ropo sed and some are actively campaigned for by organized group s. As of January 1, 1972, b anks must report to the government any deposit or withdrawal over $5,0 00. The next step will be to restrict the taking of money out of the c oun try. Big Brother is watching your bank acc oun t! Increased government control over many kinds of private schoo ls is propo sed annu ally in many state legislatures. Compulsory non -milit ary service-a universal draft of all young men and women, with on ly a mi nority going into the a rmed services has been d iscussed by the Nixon Admi nistration as an alternative to the draft. Sensitivity training is already required for an increasing number of government workers, teac hers and schoo l children. As long ago as 1961, Victor Reuther propo sed that anti- Comm unist group s and o rganizations be investigated and p laced on the Attorney General's s ubversive list. The propaganda war in progress to force registration o r confiscation o f firearms is the number one priority of all t he c ollectivists-an armed citizenry is the major roadblock to a totalitarian takeover of the United States. You are in this fight whether you want to b e or not. Unless you are a n Insider, you are a victim . Whether you are a multimilli onaire or a pauper you h ave a n enormous amoun t at stake. The Insiders are c oun ting on your being too p reoccupied with your own p roblems or too lazy to fight back while the c hains of slavery are being fastened on you. They are coun ting on their mass media to con you, frighten you, o r ridicule you ou t of saving your fr eedom, and, most of all, they are c oun ting on your thinking you can escape by not taking part in oppo sing their takeover. They are a lso coun ting on those of you who recognize the c onspiracy becomi ng so invo lved with watching all m oves that you b ec ome totally mesmerized by their machinations, and thus become incapable of acting.

Or you can end run this whole c onspiratorial apparatus. The c hoice you must m ake was enunciated by Winston Churchill when h e told the people of England: \"If you will not fight for right when you can easily win withou t blood shed; if you will not fight when your victory will be sure a nd no t too costly; you may come to the"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"moment when you will have to fight with all t he odd s against you and on ly a precarious chance of survival.\" Because we have ignored warning after warning, we a re now at that place in h istory.

You may have to fight when there is no hope of victory, beca use it i s better to p erish than live a s s laves.\" What Will You Do?

This is the e nd o f our case. If you h ave decided no t to do anything abou t it , then you can close this book, read no further, and turn ou t the light. That is just what you will be doing for the United States of America, and may God h elp u s. And may He have mercy on your soul. If you d ecide that you will do something- that you at least are not yet controlled-r ead on-pick up the ball we a re tossing you and with thousands of others, let's \"end run\" the c onspiracy. Here's how: The four keys in this program are: 1. You. What you do no w is, of course, the key to this whole operation. If you d elay, your motivation will wane, your concern will recede, bu t the danger will i ncrease. Remember, the Insiders don 't care how much you kno w abou t their conspiracy so long as you do n't do anything abou t it . So k eep reading and then act. 2. This boo k: None Dare Call It Conspiracy. In writing this book we have tried to give a concise overall picture of the nature of the conspiracy. We wrote it not only to explain the c onspiracy, but to give you a c omplete program of action no w, so that the many \"You's\" around the coun try would no t nece ssarily have to b e a rticulate salesmen to make your \"end run.\" You can sim ply pass this book ou t and let it do the job for you. The c onspiracy may be a ble to stifle pub licity on this book and k eep it off the magazine rack at your local supermarket, bu t they can't stop you from distributing it to friends, neighbo rs, relatives and bu siness associates and especially in your precinct. With a potential 30 mi llion d istribution o f this book to those mentioned abov e (and in a manner yet to be described), you will create a base of opinion that will t hrow the Insiders ou t. It is quite possible that in d istributing this book, qu estions will come up concerning certain statements and conclusions with which you are not able to deal. There are a number of organizations that have well documented material on all subjects raised in this book. But after considerable personal research the a uthor has concluded that the"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"organization which is the leader in this field, h as had the most experience, and is doing the best job o f exposing the c onspiracy is The John Birch Society. * ---- Footnote: * The Berkeley Gazette stated in an editorial of August 26, 1971, comm enting on The John Birch Society's 1958 ten po int predictions for the United States, \"Whatever Else, Call Him [Robert Welch] 'Correct.'\" Write Box 8352, San Marino, Ca. 91 108, for copy of editorial. ---- Doesn't it appear strange that this organization which works toward d ecentralization of politi cal power and the e xposure of the Insiders s hou ld b e so v ilified by the mass media, while the Coun cil On Foreign Relations, which p romotes centralization o f power in the hands of a few w ithin a world government, is practically never mentioned? So contact The John Birch Society for further back-up information (Belm ont, Massachusetts 02178 -San Marino, California 91108 -or check your telephon e directory for the nearest American Opinion Book store) 3. Your Precinct. The precinct is the lowest denominator in ou r politi cal structure. Any politi cian will agree that whoever reaches and influences the most people in the precinct wins the e lection. When you b reak do wn the job to b e don e to this least comm on d enomi nator, it doesn't seem t o b e nearly as big a job as when you look at those milli ons of votes that need to b e switched. Many elections are won o r lost by less than five votes per precinct. Remember that every vote-swit ch you can acc omplish (by planting the seed with your boo k) really amoun ts to two vo tes, as it takes one from t he other side. Start your \"end run\" in your own p recinct now. Lists of registered vo ters are a vailable from your Coun ty Registrar. With everyone working within h is own p recinct, the hit and mi ss efforts of prior years will be a voided and organization will be a dded to this effort. A blanket coverage of your precinct will create talk b etween n eighbors on this subject and thereby greatly increase the nu mber of persons reading this book. 4. Your Cong ressman. You h ave now completed the three sim ple basic moves in your \"end run. \" Barring a wholesale a wakening by the American people, it i s probably wishful thinking to b elieve that the C.F.R.'s hold on the Presidency can b e broken in 1972. But it i s possible to block the Insiders' men in the House of Representatives. Congress can still li ft a powerful voice against the conspiracy if only it would. It can also throw a searchlight on to the C.F.R.'s s trangleho ld on the e xecutive branch o f the government. No bu rglar tries to rob a hou se when a spotlight is on h im . With your effort Congress can be that spotlight. It is at the Congressional level that the c onspiracy can b e delayed at least until t here is sufficient strength to rout it. But your local Cong ressional candidates must be forced to take a pub lic stand on the Coun cil on Foreign Relations, its goals, and its power in the federal government. And on ce your candidate is elected you must m ake sure that"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"he does not submit t o the incredible pressure which will be put upon h im i n Washington to compromi se his principles. The Congressman for whom you are laying the base for election must be a s s teadfast in Washington as he is at home in p ersonal conv ersation with you. Keep in mi nd that a Cong ressman must return to h is constituents every two years for re-approval. How w ould you like to be a Cong ressman who had vo ted for any one of the 14 Signpo sts to Slavery, asking to b e e lected by constituents who h ad read None Dare Call It Conspiracy? It is therefore easier to k eep a Congressman on the straight and narrow than a Senator or the President. The latter run less frequently than Congressmen and represent tremendou sly larger geographical areas. Although it i s not easy, it is s till possible for a good Cong ressman to finance his campaign from within his district and no t be dependent on the Insiders for campaign contributions. If there a re no Cong ressional candidates worth suppo rting in your area a t this tim e, suppo rt one or more in o ther areas. Never contribute money to the Repub lican o r Democratic National Committ ee. That m oney, except in token amoun ts, will never reac h anti-C.F.R.-Establishment candidates, most of whom suffer fr om a severe shortage of fund s, at least until they are well established. Only contribute your campaign do llars to those who are c ommitt ed to fighting the c onspiracy. A candidate runn ing on good conservative principles is not enough. We 've had many such candidates, and althou gh most of them are very good men, they never come to grips with the real problems- exposing those behind the World Socialist Movement. So, o rganize your \"end run, \" pass out your book s and then k eep your eagle e ye on your Congressman and his voting record. This \"end run\" concept we are suggesting is not just a game we a re playing even thou gh we use a football t erm. To summ arize: You do no t nece ssarily have to b e a n articulate salesman to make this \"end run. \" You do no t necessarily have to kno w all the in's and ou t's of the total conspiracy-the book is intended to do this for you. All you h ave to do is find the wherewithal to pu rchase the book s and o ne way or another see that you b lanket your precinct with them. Then force your Congressman to stand up to the C.F.R. Establishment. It is sim ple. It is s traightforward. It is a workable plan. With 30 million \"end runs\" being made during 1972, you can, and will, rout the conspiracy, turn the tide of history and p revent the e nslavement of yourself and your fami ly. Remember, seeds planted in 1972 will pay off not only this year, bu t in 1 974 and 1976. If we do no t build a large c oun ter-revolutionary base in 1972 the ball game will be lost by 1976."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Me mbers Of The Coun cil O n Foreign Relations Nominated And App ointed By President Nixon To Government Posts ¤ Adm.
