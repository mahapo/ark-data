Is that outrageous? Is itinflammatory? I hope so!I have four degrees from MIT but I don’t want to be the smart boy scientist inkhakis and a sport shirt giving a TED talk and then going out for a cappuccino.One of the themes of this book will be the relationship between the center andthe periphery – in a human cell, in a human body, and in all aspects of humanaffairs, and the realization that there actually is no “center” but one that hasbeen imposed on us from “above.”I was definitely born in the periphery, the child of a lower caste family inIndia where my grandmother was a spiritual healer. But, I don’t want to be awise and gentle guru telling you about the Hindu god with the head of anelephant.Here’s what I do want. But it’s more than “want.” It’s “need.” I need to tellyou about what I’ve learned in my unique education and in my even more uniquelife experiences.Why do I need that? It’s not to stoke my ego. It’s not to be on television. It’sbecause a time for change – radical change – has arrived and I have a role toplay at this historic moment. I have tools to provide. Not physical tools, butvital information for this opportunity so that we don’t blow it.I feel like I’ve been given an assignment. I’ve been cast in a role, and it’snot an easy one to fulfill. I have to tell people the truth – and when theydon’t believe me I have to change their minds.I invented the first authentic, comprehensive email system when I was a14-year-old working as a Research Fellow at the University of Medicine andDentistry of New Jersey. That’s the truth but it’s a controversial statement.I’ve been called “delusional.”So why don’t I just forget about it? Why don’t I shut up about it?Here’s why. That experience took place in the cultural context of growing up asa lower-caste Indian kid where my earliest memories as a four year old was beingsegregated and given water in a different bowl from my “upper caste friends” andemigrating from the extremes of Bombay and a small south Indian rural villageMuhavur in Tamil Nadu to Newark, New Jersey. It was part of a timeline thatincluded observing my grandmother’s practice of Siddha, an ancient system ofmedicine and healing and also attending an elite program in computer science atNYU’s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences while still in high school.It’s very true that I haven’t followed the standard nerd script and said, “Awshucks” – but it’s not because I’m delusional. On the contrary, I’ve beenstripped of all delusions about how things work for innovators who don’t fit themold.What’s really delusional are people inside a centralized academic, corporate, orgovernment environment sitting in judgment of me when I’m a creature of theperiphery. That’s an entirely different setting and I’m a different kind ofperson in every way.It’s also delusional for those in controlling positions in academia, business,or government to imagine I’m not going to share my experiences in order toignite radical and positive change.Yes, I am a revolutionary. I was five years old when a friend of my father’scame to our home and said poor villagers were taking up arms against theirlandowners. He said the villagers didn't have any money and didn't have any foodand didn't have any clothes.So I said, “But that’s wrong.”The man told my father, “Your son is a communist.”“Don’t worry,” my father said. “When he gets older he'll change.”But I haven’t changed. My anger – no, my hatred – has only exponentiallyincreased against those who rule through exploitation, influence, andintimidation. Priests, saints, gurus, and therapists all advise us againsthating our enemies, but millions of people can’t afford that luxury. Meanwhile,those wise counselors are profiting, directly or indirectly, as servants of theenemy who we’re not supposed to hate.I have learned about the enemy. I’ve known all about the manipulative dogmas anddoctrines we’re fed every day. I reached the highest levels of academia. I’veappeared in front of audiences with bestselling New Age authors. I lived inHollywood and rubbed shoulder with narcissistic celebrities whose concern forclimate change or some social cause was all about getting lots of Tweets andre-Tweets.I've held a high position in the Indian government. I saw how a feudal,colonialist mentality still pervades that country at a cost of billions. I’veseen how so-called eminent scientists and major American medical researchinstitutions really work. Their first concern is getting funding for their petprojects, securing tenure or getting some paper published. Curing a disease islargely an afterthought.So I’ve learned from the enemy and I’ve also fought them my whole life. There’sa dramatic photo of my burning the South African flag as a 17-year-oldundergraduate on the steps of the MIT Student Center. I had just led a majorprotest against MIT’s investments in apartheid South Africa. I challenged theMIT administration to provide proper wages for food service workers and toincrease enrollment for poor students, women and minorities. At my PhDgraduation, I was the only one who raised a banner “US Out of Iraq” demanding anend to the US invasion. Half the crowd cheered and the other half booed me. Iexposed corruption at the highest scientific institution in India, and wasforced to flee India. I’ve fought the Raytheon Corporation about my rightfulplace in history for the invention of email. I’m now fighting Monsanto to exposethe lack of safety standards in GMOs.So, it’s not just an intellectual pursuit. I want to fight these forces of evil,because that is what they are. I want you to join me in that fight. I want toshare, in this book, my weapons – the weapons I’ve learned from the enemy.What’s my most powerful weapon? What’s the weapon that can finally win? It’s nota gun or a bomb. It’s the science of systems. It’s seeing and reallyunderstanding how things are connected. And it’s also seeing all the traps anddistractions that are put in your way.Here’s the best part. Once you learn this science – once enough peopleunderstand it – we can create an army that will win the war. Which is the firstthing they don’t want you to know!To distract you, to keep you feeling small and helpless, what they want to do isindoctrinate you. They want to “convert” you because, as Marx said, “Religion isthe opiate of the people.”Religion? Yes, that’s right – because, take my word for it, you’ve beenindoctrinated, and very possibly converted, by one of the “religions” thatcontrol how we relate to our thoughts, our feelings, our bodies, our health, ourwork, our relationships, our education, our future, our past, our present, andvirtually everything in our lives.You’ve been scammed by the priesthoods whose dogmas falsify who you are and whatyou are. Those priesthoods are powerful and convincing. They’re smart,well-funded, and ruthless. They want your money, but that’s only the first step.What they really want is power over you. They want you to bow down. And it’sworking. Millions of people are bowing down and there’s an excellent chanceyou’ve been one of them. But you’re ready to change. I know you are, because ifyou weren’t, you wouldn’t be reading a book with revolution in its title.The largest and most powerful of these soul-crushing doctrines is a reductionistscience that fragments reality and somehow manages to make things seem bothsimpler and more complicated than they really are. I say this as a scientistwhose education from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology spans multipledisciplines: electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, architecture, andbiological engineering. We’ll look very closely at reductionism and its effects in subsequent chapters.Seemingly opposite to reductionist science – but actually complementary to it –is the sentimental mysticism of gurus, miracles, and manifestations from theuniverse. (And once again, I say this as someone who grew up right in the midstof the ancient wisdom and traditions of India.)In popular culture, this doctrine is called the “New Age” category. It draws onnon-denominational religion – “spirituality”– rather than science. There may besome watered down references to Galileo or Einstein, but basically things justhappen for a very self-centered and sentimental reason. We may not know exactlywhy or how, but that doesn’t really matter. The hugely successful book (andvideo) called The Secret was based on the idea that we can attract success,money, or whatever into our lives by thinking about it or wanting it. Exactlyhow that works is beyond our understanding, but so what? It sounds beautiful,and that’s all you need to know. Might as well take an aspirin or Valium, tolull us into peace, harmony and oblivion.Both reductionist science and New Age proselytizers have their own priesthoods,rituals, commandments, and taboos. Those rules and regulations are actually themost important things about those dogmas, because neither of them can reallydescribe (much less solve) many of the most important problems of our lives.The word “spirituality” has also been abused and manipulated by thispriesthood. The true and greatest spiritual leaders consistently addressed theissues of the here and now, and challenged the centralization of power andauthority. For them, Heaven was not distinct from Earth. In the Hindutradition, the great Shankaracharya asked a fundamental question, “If there isequality in heaven, why isn’t there equality on earth?” That question in the8th century gave rise to the Bhakthi Movement, one based on devotion and lovethat led to early breakdowns of the caste system (which were later reversed bythe brutality of colonialism starting in the 17th century).Jesus also addressed the here and now. He whipped the moneylenders in thetemple. Yes, whipped them. He got angry, and threw them out. He perturbed thereligious hierarchy, which was subjugating the masses. These political issues,however, are never discussed in churches and written off as some anomaly ofJesus’ behavior. But the essence of Jesus’ teachings was justice, truth andlove for all, here and now, “… it is easier for a camel to go through the eye ofa needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!” A realspiritualist is a revolutionary. To sit by and speak of spiritual enlightenmentand watch one’s brothers and sisters and you be subjugated to lies,exploitation, and pale reductionist aspects of truth is inhuman andnon-spiritual.A hundred years ago, Vladimir Lenin led the Russian revolution with the slogan\"Peace, Land, and Bread.\" Peace meant ending Russia’s involvement in World WarI. Land meant redistributing aristocrats’ estates to the peasants. Bread meantan end to food shortages and starvation. Today we have our own version of “land”– which means an abundance of material possessions for a small number of people,and a fanatical desire to possess them by a multitude of others. We have “bread”– which means enough to eat, even if it’s often unhealthy and is simply anotherresource for corporate profit.Most disturbingly, we also have the current version of “peace” – which is simplyan anesthetized numbness or a bewildering blindness, perpetuated by thatpriesthood. Whether it’s in politics, organized religion, healthcare, or ahundred other areas of our lives, we’re in the dark and we don’t even know it.This goes much further than that famous line from The Wizard of Oz, “Pay noattention to the man behind the curtain.” We’ve been taught that there isn’t anycurtain, much less a man.But pointing out all the problems is only the first step. The next step isaction. What is to be done?In order to introduce the principles of systems theory in the most grounded andpractical way, this book will show how the human body – your body – is a system.Once you understand the dynamics of a system in your physical self, you’ll seehow it occurs everywhere. When you gain a revolutionary perspective about whoand what you are as an interconnected system of systems that follow fundamentalprinciples, you’ll be able to apply that revolutionary perspective to your lifeand the world as a whole.Revolution is an essential part of systems theory, and revolution isn’tincremental. It’s about clearly seeing the current situation, setting goals forpositive change, and taking action in that direction. It’s not a matter ofsaying everything is perfect now or everything will be perfect – because that’sjust another way of talking ourselves out of taking action. Perfection is notthe goal, but rather a commitment to the goal, no matter how seeminglyimpossible the goal may seem, and to take deliberate and conscious action toachieve that goal.Previous revolutionaries did not do everything perfectly, but that doesn’t meanwe shouldn’t take revolutionary action ourselves. Plus, we have information andtechnologies that they didn’t have. Creating email would have been impossiblebefore there was computer code, and many people said it was still impossible.But something is “impossible” only until it happens. It was impossible for MikeTyson to get knocked out. But once he got knocked out, “Oh yeah, I guess itactually was possible.”The foundation principle of an engineering system is to keep getting better –not to be perfect immediately, but to improve. That’s also the underlyingprinciple of this book. If it seems impossible to do it perfectly at this pointin time, or if it failed in the past, that doesn’t mean we don’t do it.The compelling forces that drive human history forward are the desire for truth,freedom and health. We’ve failed, and we’re also getting better at it. TheWright brothers’ first aircraft only flew for twelve seconds, but we don’tcriticize the Wright brothers because they didn’t create a space shuttle.The following are five key principles of a systems perspective on revolutionarychange:1. We must know how things are interconnected in the world. The interconnectionsmatter more than the parts. We must understand the connection between the centerand the periphery, and we must look beyond the centralized command-and-controlmodel to realize there is no “center.”2. Truth emerges when the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.3. Real change is rapid and fast when a “critical mass” or boiling point hasbeen achieved. At exactly 212 degrees Fahrenheit, water starts vaporizingbecause particles are moving in the same direction. It’s sudden, fast andirreversible. The movement or “transport” of mass literally creates, what we sayin science, “a phase transition” – a Revolution.4. We need an accurate and reality-based feedback process that allows for thetracking of clearly set goals and indicates when they have been achieved, andwhen we are off course. This feedback process allows us to repeat, adjust, orend our input behavior.5. There is no belief or aspiration to perfection. There is commitment to a goaland a commitment to iterate toward the goal, and the goal emerges from theinteraction of the system with itself and its neighboring systems. We will be revisiting these principles throughout the book. But a major pointshould be made right here. If our worthwhile goals are set, but those goals areunacceptable to the currently prevailing system, our goals cannot be achieveduntil the goals of the currently prevailing system are disabled or seized. Andthe goals of the currently prevailing system are quite straightforward: maximizeprofit, expand markets, monopolize and control resources, and continue alongthese lines indefinitely.So what are our goals? Let’s recall the slogan of the Russian revolution: Peace,Land, and Bread. Today, we have Bread but not Health. We have Land but noFreedom. Our Peace is without Truth.To begin moving toward goals of genuine Truth, Freedom and Health, this bookwill introduce a systems approach to your own body and how it works. This willopen up to a wider recognition that Health requires Freedom, and Freedom demandsTruth to control our destiny.Are you committed to Truth, Freedom and Health? Is that why you’ve chosen toread this book? Then join me in creating this revolution. We have nothing to lose but ourchains."},{"pageContent":"PART ONE"},{"pageContent":"THE SYSTEM "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONESYSTEMS THEORY: AN OVERVIEWEinstein said, “God doesn’t play dice with the universe.”He was referring to the seemingly random nature of quantum mechanics, but hismessage can also apply to the everyday world. It seems like a reassuringmessage, because the ups and downs of our lives can seem chaotic.But if the universe isn’t a dice game, what is it? Systems theory offers ananswer. The basics are easy to understand, and as you learn more, you’ll startto see what “not playing dice” really means.A system is a set of objects or energies working together for a specific goal orpurpose. Your car is a system with thousands of components. Your cell phone isanother.Systems can be simple or complex. Washing machines, clocks, pencil sharpeners,even the solar system and the whole universe are systems. Your body is a systemwith many subsystems inside it.There are only two basic classes of systems. Once you understand how they work,you can understand how everything works. And as Einstein said, it’s not a dicegame. It’s not just one random thing after another. Everything is connected, andyou’ll see what that means once you know what to look for.Every system in the universe is either an open loop system or a closed loopsystem. Both kinds of systems have five basic elements: * Input * Transport * Conversion * Structure * OutputThe image below illustrates the five elements of an open loop system. Inputrefers to what goes into the system, which can be information, energy, orphysical matter. Transport indicates the movement or flow of Input through thesystem. Conversion is the transformation of Input into final Output, which againmay be matter, energy or information. Structure refers to the form andboundaries of a system that gives it definition and sustainability, as the bonesand muscles do for a human body.Open Loop System[../images/00002.jpeg] It’s called an open loop system because it’s permanently open to Input. Anelectric heater is a good example of an open loop system. Activating the heatersends an Input of electric current into the heater. Transport is the aspect ofthe system that moves electric and thermal energy within the system. Conversion,represented by the heating coils, transforms the electrical energy into heat.The Structure element forms and contains the entire system. Heat is the finalOutput.Once the machine is turned on, the system will remain open. It will continuetaking in electricity and sending out heat without any self-regulation. It willkeep working at the same rate until it is turned off.A closed loop system works differently. It includes four additional elements: aGoal; a Sensor; a Controller; and Disturbance. These elements enable aself-regulated and continuous adjustment of the Input – in order to achieve adesired Output that matches the Goal – in spite of Disturbances to the system –through the use of a Sensor and a Controller.A closed loop system is illustrated below.Closed Loop System[../images/00003.jpeg] Closed loop systems are called “intelligent” because a process ofself-adjustment and refinement is continually going on using the Controller,which adjusts the Input based on observing the difference between the desiredGoal and the actual Output. An apartment with central heating and a thermostatis a good example. Let’s say the desired temperature for the apartment is 78degrees. That’s the Goal, and the Goal is achieved when the Output of heat intothe apartment is equal to the Goal.The thermostat is the Controller. It receives information about temperature froma Sensor, the thermometer. The Controller determines the difference between theGoal and the Output. It then calculates how much Input is needed to Transportoil into the furnace for the Conversion of oil to heat. The oil tank is theStructure in which the oil is stored. If there are Disturbances (like a colddraft in the apartment) the Sensor will communicate that Disturbance to theController, which adjusts the Input as needed. The process continues as aclosed, self-regulating, system to achieve and maintain the Goal of 78 degrees.Here are the nine elements of a closed loop system: * Input * Output * Transport * Conversion * Structure * Goal * Controller * Sensor * Disturbance If you wanted to study systems at MIT, your advisor would recommend a classcalled Control Systems and Feedback. There, toward the end of the semester, youwould be given the classic example of an airplane in flight as a model of highlycomplex systems.An airplane in flight has important Goals. One Goal is to maintain a certainspeed, say 600 miles per hour. The pilot is the Controller. The air speedindicator acting as a Sensor provides information about the plane’s speed. Thepilot continually notes the difference between the desired Goal of 600 miles perhour and the Output – the current speed of the plane.If the current speed is only 500 miles per hour, the pilot, serving as theController, will convey a new Input that Transports fuel into the jet engineswhich Convert the jet fuel, which is stored in the Structure of the plane, intothrust, that increases the speed of the plane to achieve a new Output.It may happen, however, that the engines increase the speed to only 590 milesper hour. Then the Controller – the pilot – must send a new Input signaling theneed for more fuel until the speed stabilizes at 600 miles per hour. Sometimes,too, the Controller may overshoot the speed to 650 miles per hour, by havingsignaled a higher Input that sends too much fuel, so that Input will need to bereduced. This feedback process is continuous and self-regulating. The Controller alwaysassesses the Output relative to the Goal, and makes the appropriate adjustments,until the Output matches the Goal.Sometimes, Disturbances from the environment (or another system) will occur. These Disturbances need to be observed and also fed back to the Controller.Consider the simple case of a Disturbance, such as a headwind of 100 miles perhour. Clearly, in this case the weather is another system that provides a windDisturbance. That Disturbance will need to be accounted for in determining theInput to the engines. The pilot will have to increase the Input accordingly andproportionately to achieve the Goal of 600 miles per hour. In control systemstheory, this is called “proportional control.” There are many types of suchControllers.Closed loop systems are dynamic by nature. They’re always in flux. They’reconstantly making adjustments. “Perfection” is not a permanent condition, nor isit the “goal.” It’s an imaginary concept where the Goal is always beingapproached but is never sustained. It has to be reached for, over and overagain.One important aspect of this entire process is that though the systems may be ofthe same kind e.g. airplanes, the nature or system type of an airplane may bedifferent. Different system types can be distinguished by the relativedifferences in the levels of Transport, Conversion and Structure elements. Beingaware of these differences is essential to intelligently achieving the Goals ofa system.To illustrate this, let’s continue the airplane analogy by observing threedifferent types of airplanes: a fighter jet, a passenger plane and a militarycargo plane – in short, three different types of systems.A modern fighter jet is capable of enormous speeds, has to be fast, nimble,quick and needs to be able to make rapid changes in direction, but it also needsconstant maintenance. The pilot in this case serves to be the Controller, as hisor her ability to respond to Sensor feedback and Disturbances are critical towinning a battle. The fighter jet is a system whose Transport elements, theaspect of movement, are relatively more dominant than its Conversion andStructure elements. As the jet interacts with external elements like bumps onthe landing strip or turbulence in the air, its powerful but delicate Transportmechanisms require attention. Such components can easily go out of balance. It’snot that there’s anything fundamentally wrong. It’s just the nature of ahigh-speed plane that the Transport elements can’t be perfected and permanentlystabilized.A modern passenger plane is a very different type of system than a fighter jet.The passenger plane needs to be able to move hundreds of customers in a verysafe and cost effective manner. Fuel efficiency in this respect is important ifan airline is going to stay in business. This demands that in such planes,great care is put into the Conversion element, such as the jet engines, toprocess fuel and generate thrust as efficiently as possible. Although the humanpilots do actively supervise takeoffs and landings, the plane automaticallyflies itself to a large degree to optimize the use of fuel. In systemsterminology, the pilots no longer perform the Controller or Sensor functions.The Goal is set, and the plane does the rest. While this has many advantages, ifthe plane’s computers become overloaded and crash or make an error, an emergencycan occur. Again in systems terminology, the Controller or Sensor elements, insuch an event, are likely to be compromised, and demand the pilot become theController.A final example is a huge military cargo plane. That kind of plane exemplifieswhere the Structure element is of greater importance than the Conversion orTransport element. It needs to carry huge amounts of material, but the weight ofthe loads needs to be checked and properly secured. Great care goes intoensuring the right materials are used in building the Structure or body of sucha cargo plane so it can carry tanks, howitzers, helicopters, in its belly. Ifthis isn’t done, the Structural benefits of the plane – the fact it carries alot of weight – can change from an advantage to a danger.There are two (2) key points that emerge from the previous discussion:1. Systems theory teaches us, first, that perfection is a false goal; and,2. Dealing successfully with the inevitable and ongoing systems variations fromone type of airplane to another – or, more importantly, from one person to thenext, or more broadly from one system type to another, is key to understandingthe situation at hand, in order to achieve our Goal. Now consider your body as a system. In terms of your physical and emotionalwellbeing, you must learn to be the Controller of your health. You must takeresponsibility for the Inputs into your system: your diet, your exercise, yoursleep schedule, and the people you bring into your life. And in order to dothat, you need to get the best information you possibly can, so you can choosewhat Inputs are right for YOU.But that’s not as simple as it sounds. Your goal is to optimize your health, butthat’s not the goal of the decision makers who create the environment you livein. Their goal is to optimize their profits. Your responsibility is to becomeyour own life’s Controller, but their objective is to seize that power forthemselves and their corporations or government bureaucracies. Their goals,ultimately, are based on distracting and lulling you, so you don’t takeaccountability and be the Controller of your health. They like it when youbecome a “dumb” consumer, and simply follow some fad diet, buy their latestbestseller, and use a one-size-fits-all protocol, or other bogus and irrationalrules based on some mysticism, that is rooted in faith and belief that havenothing to do with your body or your particular system.In order to achieve their goals they have plenty of resources at their disposal.They control the media, they control politics, they control science, medicineand health care, and they control the bankers that can pay for it all.So what can you do about it? Begin by looking around and applying the conceptswe’ve been discussing. Notice connections instead of seeing random rolls of thedice.You can use your physical self to help with this. Do you have a headache? Why doyou think that is? Is it because you’re tense, or you didn’t get enough sleep,or you drank too much? Or maybe you have no idea at all why you have a headache.Mysterious though it may be, thinking about your headache, its causes, and yourresponse to it can start you thinking about things from a systems point of view.Is there anyone who profits from your having a headache? Or who profits from howyou try to get rid of it?Thinking like that is a good way to start becoming the Controller of your body,your system, and your own life too. Yes, that’s a start. There’s much more tocome."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOREDUCTIONISMAlex is a forty-one year old married man, the father of two children, who livesin New England. He has a twin brother and two sisters and is close to hisextended family. He is 5’9” tall and weighs 196 pounds, 30 pounds more thanwhen he played on his college tennis team. Alex works in the computer industry.He spends most of his days (and many of his nights) hunkered down in front of amonitor. The only exercise he gets is playing with his children, but they’remostly interested in electronic games.Those are some facts about Alex, but who is he really? The truth is, he’s manythings to many people.To his doctor, for example, Alex is a man who should lose weight and lower hisslightly elevated blood pressure. The doctor has given him three months toaccomplish this through diet and exercise. If that doesn’t work, Alex will haveto start taking medication.Five years ago, on his first visit to this doctor, Alex shared a memory from histeenage years. He was home from school on a snow day, helping his father shovelthe driveway. Then his father suddenly collapsed with chest pains, and Alexcalled the emergency hotline 911. The doctor knows that Alex’s father has apacemaker and that Alex doesn’t want that for himself.The doctor also knows that Alex, who inherited his mother’s fair skin, has hadsurgery for a patch of squamous cell skin cancer on his nose. Alex has promisedhis wife and his mother that he will never again go fishing or do anything outin the sun without first covering himself with sunscreen.But Alex is more than the collection of symptoms he presents to his MD. To hiswife, he is a loving husband who likes to bake bread and make pasta for thefamily. He spends too much time on his computer. Sometimes he snores at night.To his parents, Alex is a devoted son who calls regularly and is alwaysavailable to help out. To his co-workers, he is a hard-working employee who hasan intricate knowledge of the newest technology. To his twin brother, with whomhe shares a close, but sometimes competitive, relationship, he is a best friendand a formidable chess opponent. To his children, he is “Daddy, daddy, play withme! I need more batteries! Will you fix this? Can we go to the park?” To hisdog, he’s the guy who throws a ball further than anyone else.So who is Alex? There’s no single answer. The dilemma of, “Who is he?” or forthat matter, “Who am I?” is as old as time.An ancient parable makes this point. A group of disciples approached the Buddhawith some serious questions about whether the world is finite or infinite, andwhether the human soul dies or lives on forever.The Buddha replied, “Once there was an important raja (a king) who assembled allthe blind men in his kingdom in a courtyard. In the center of the courtyard wasan elephant. One at a time, each of the blind men was led forward to put theirhands on the elephant’s body. One man touched the head, another the tusks,another the ears. And so it went, with each man feeling a different part of theelephant.After they were done, the raja asked of each of them, “What is this thing wecall an elephant?”The man who touched the head said, “An elephant is like a pot.” The man whotouched the tail said, “An elephant is a brush.” The man who touched the tuskssaid, “An elephant is a spear.” They each described the elephant according towhat they touched. The Buddha used this story to teach the impossibility ofabsolutes. We all view the world differently, because we are all different.For a systems biologist, there is a short – but complex – answer to questionslike, “Who is Alex?” or “What is an elephant?” Alex is a system. Ditto theelephant. But we can’t know the true nature of the system until we see it in itsentirety by knowing not the parts, but the interconnections.This brings up the important concept of reductionism. In 1687 Isaac Newtonpublished his great work entitled Principles of Natural Philosophy. Since then,Western science has been based on a simple and reasonably reliable assumption:to understand something in the natural world, take it apart.Want to understand a watch? Take it apart and examine the pieces. Want to figureout why an engine runs, or figure out how a human body functions? Look at theparts one at a time. If you understand the parts, you can understand the whole.It’s certainly easy to understand why this approach can be so appealing. Somethings are simply too complex and huge to grasp any other way. It’s complicatedso we reduce it down to its smaller parts. This approach is known asreductionism. Let’s follow reductionism to its logical conclusion. If it’s informative toreduce something to smaller parts, wouldn’t it be even more informative toreduce something to parts that are as small as possible? We can look at a treeand have some general understanding of what it is, but can we have a deeperunderstanding of the tree if we look at the chemistry of the leaves? Or even theatomic structure of the leaves, the bark, and the roots?The answer to that is both yes and no. Quantum physics, for example, isconcerned with the smallest possible particles in the universe. To the extent wecan understand those infinitely small particles – which isn’t easy – we canunderstand what the universe really is at the most basic level.Great! But here’s the problem. We don’t experience the universe at the mostbasic level of its trillions of sub-microscopic parts. We experience it as anamalgamation of those parts that has become a vast interconnected system. It’strue that atoms are almost completely empty space, but that fact isn’t going tohelp you if you get hit by a car. The reductionist focus on separate parts candistract or even blind us to the reality of those parts as a whole system –especially when the whole system, as the saying goes, is somehow more than thesum of its parts.Reductionist science has of course contributed greatly to human knowledge. Butthe limits of reductionism are apparent in our current health careestablishment, with its high costs, uneven quality of care, and drug developmentprotocols that are expensive and slow. Reductionism fostered the modernhealthcare system that was able to respond well to a crisis, like an injury oran acute illness. But today there’s a growing demand for a system that deliversprevention, can deal effectively with chronic conditions, and is considerate ofthe long-term effects of specific therapeutics, protocols, and procedures, on apersonalized level.The modern health care system came into being during the industrial era. It wasstructured to manage calamities of war, and the system itself followed amilitary model, with doctors as officers and nurses as enlisted personnel. Thoseconditions encouraged reductionist thinking. Wartime situations required ahealthcare system that rewarded specialization and “magic bullet” solutions: asingle drug, the right specialist, or the right procedure to address immediateand catastrophic events. Reductionism was effective in that context, delivering life-saving solutionsafter the onset of disease or injury. But reductionism now pervades all aspectsof the modern healthcare, including basic research, patient treatment and drugdevelopment. We are literally using a healthcare system designed for war andcrises to manage the day-to-day healthcare of modern life, which should beprimarily based on prevention.Here’s an example of how this works. My friend recently visited her internist,with a sinus infection. The internist sent her to an ENT - an ear, nose, andthroat specialist. The ENT examined her and made recommendations for medication.My friend complained that a post-nasal drip making its way from the sinusesthrough her throat and into her lungs was giving her a bad cough. The ENT saidhe was sorry but the cough involved the lungs, and he didn’t treat anythingbelow the neck.The reductionism of modern healthcare compels increasing specialization, where aproblem is divided into many smaller problems. As medical consumers, we know howexasperating this can be. We know that we can’t always divide our bodies up intoparts. We know that the foot bone is connected to the anklebone and theanklebone is connected to the shin bone and the shin bone is connected to theknee bone. Yet, if we have a foot pain and a knee pain, we have to visit atleast two different doctors, who in all probability are not consulting with eachother to determine if there is a connection. This is one of the problemsassociated with a reductionist approach to health.21st Century science is beginning to realize that a reductionist approach offersonly part of the truth. When you connect a bunch of things, whether they areauto parts or human parts, something emerges that is greater and different thanthe sum of its parts. Take something as basic as a clock. If you take a clockapart, it’s nothing more than a collection of odd assorted pieces. When it’s puttogether in the right order, with the right connections, a clock assumes analmost magical function in terms of what it does and how a reliance on anaccurate reading of time impacts your world. If this is true for a clock,imagine what happens when you are talking about a living organism, whether it isa tree, an animal, or a human being.Systems thinking, and systems biology specifically, can help us understandhealth and illness as a dynamic interconnection of parts. It’s not just the rawsum of their individual components, much less the parts by themselves. This iscritically important, because more often than not, reductionist Controllers willshow you only those parts of a system that they want you to see, because itleads you down a path that is convenient to them, not the truth.A reductionist might tell you that taking a certain pill will reduce headache ormuscle pain, and indeed it will. That same reductionist might not tell you thatthe pill can damage your kidney function.Similarly, a reductionist analysis of the oil and natural gas mining processknown as hydraulic fracking could show significant profit potential undercertain market conditions. But fracking also seems to be related to an incidenceof earthquakes in parts of the country that haven’t had an earthquake forthousands of years. The larger system, of which fracking is a part includes bothfinancial and seismological components.The truth is that truth itself emerges not from one element of a system, butfrom the interconnections of the elements. Moreover, the interconnectionsthemselves are an element of the system, and often the most important element.Systems biology, and systems theory in general, recognizes that a system can’tbe understood by taking it apart. To understand a system or to understand anypart of it, you must know how the parts relate to one another, and to the whole.That is a philosophical principle of system thinking.A revolutionary principle of systems thinking is demanding to know how the partsrelate and interconnect to the whole. If that information is withheld from you,you must find a way to get it. Remember, our Goal, collectively and individuallyis Truth, Freedom and Health, and settling for a small and mistaken shadow oftruth like one of those blind men with flawed Sensors will only mislead us awayfrom that Goal.So, if we are committed to our Goal, then getting that information mandates acertain necessary action, but if those in control refuse to take action to giveus that information, then you must take action to see that the action gets done– perhaps, as Malcolm X said, “By any means necessary.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREEEMERGENT PROPERTIESEarlier I mentioned the two priesthoods of our present culture – reductionistscience, which developed from a Western rationalist tradition of Isaac Newtonand a quasi-Eastern neo-Buddhist self-help peace-and-love movement featuringgurus and motivational speakers.I don’t see myself in either of those categories. I’m an engineer, and engineersare primarily workhorses. We get the work done, while the priesthoods of East orWest postulate and theorize. Engineers build things – and because of theconstraints and imperfections of the physical world, whatever we build must beopen to change and refinement.More specifically, I’m a biological systems engineer, an electrical engineer anda mechanical engineer with advanced training in design. I see things asengineering systems spanning multiple domains and disciplines. Systems are basedon connections and the emergent properties that arise out of those connections.To put it more poetically, an emergent property is a higher-level phenomenonthat comes into being when lower level parts are connected in a specific way. Inbiological systems, that emergent property can be anything such asconsciousness, one’s weight, or even a particular ailment or disease. Theunderlying connections are always the key.One theory is that consciousness itself emerges when enough number ofinterconnections takes place across millions of neurons in the brain. So fromlower to higher life forms, given that the physical size of the brain and numberof neurons varies, varying states of consciousness emerge, since the number ofinterconnections grows exponentially. Similarly, an ailment or disease emergesfrom the multitude of interconnections of many bad behaviors: bad food, noexercise, wrong “friends,” stress, etc.Let’s see how this looks, from a biological level. In 2002, after more than adecade of research, the Human Genome Project completed sequencing of the humangenome or DNA.By now, anyone who has ever watched a police based drama on television has someidea of what DNA is. Our DNA, a genetic configuration unique to each of us,stores information and instructions on our personal characteristics. The genesin our DNA determine our eye color, how many teeth we have, the color of ourhair, as well as tendencies toward developing certain illnesses. The HumanGenome Project’s goal was to identify all the genes in the human DNA along withtheir locations and their function. It was a massive undertaking.When the Human Genome Project got under way, there were two key assumptions:1.The difference or complexity between a human being and other organisms, suchas a worm, was the number of genes in DNA; and,2. If the entire human genome could be mapped, then manipulating the DNA couldcontrol any and all aspects of life. Ironically, the Human Genome Project disclosed that not only were the two keyassumptions wrong, but also that DNA may be relatively less important to ourcurrent and future states of existence. The scientists involved with the HumanGenome Project originally believed that humans possessed a larger number ofgenes than other life forms. It was an understandable assumption: we havepreeminence over other life forms; therefore we must have more genes. During theearly stages of the Project, most expected that humans would have at least500,000 to 1,000,000 genes. As time went on during the sequencing phase, theestimates changed to 100,000, then 50,000 then 30,000. Eventually it wasrevealed that we have the about the same number of genes as the lowlyearthworm—somewhere in the neighborhood of 25,000.Yet, we are so different. So clearly, the number of genes is not a measure ofcomplexity. In short, an emergent property was revealed: we are more than ourgenes and, as humans, we have power over our destiny beyond the DNA we inheritedfrom our parents and ancestors.The scientific community reeled from this discovery. How was it possible that aworm, which looks so different from a human being, could have the same number ofgenes?To help understand that question, we have to think about the function of ourgenes and, consequently, our DNA. People are often confused about thedifference between DNA and genes. DNA, which is stored in the nucleus of all ofour cells, is often likened to a set of blueprints or codes that contains theinstructions necessary to construct other components of cells.The discovery of DNA in the early 1950s by the British biologists James Watsonand Francis Crick is one of the most celebrated achievements in the wholehistory of science. Watson and Crick asserted that DNA is completely “incharge.” DNA is the central Controller of who we are and what we become.Genes are the essential components of our DNA. They hold the secrets of what youare and what you will become, based on who came before you in your genetic line.Genes provide instructions for the creation of specific molecular configurationscalled proteins. These proteins are created outside of the cell nucleus, in whatis known as the cytoplasm of the cell. In the cytoplasm, instructions from thegenes arrive via a molecule called messenger RNA. The proteins are thensynthesized in the cytoplasm.Each protein has a particular function. The protein Insulin, for example, iscritical in metabolizing or breaking down sugars. If you don’t have enoughinsulin, you have a high likelihood of getting diabetes. This tendency todiabetes is something we inherit through our genes.The so-called “central dogma” of Watson and Crick concerning DNA is as follows: 1. DNA, within the nucleus of each cell, stores the genetic information of who we are. 2. The genes in our DNA provide instructions through a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) to create proteins. 3. Proteins are created outside of the nucleus of our cells. 4. Proteins, the molecular machines of our body, interact or “dance” with each other in order to orchestrate different types of molecular pathways, such as metabolism, synthesis, etc. Looking at this, we can see how DNA was believed to be the “mastermind” of theentire operation of life, giving rise to the successive effects of mRNA,proteins, and molecular pathways. It was a one-way street with DNA as thesource; other elements were its effects.The Human Genome Project ironically revealed that the complexity of human beingscouldn’t be explained by looking at our DNA alone. We especially need toconsider the dance of proteins and molecules, known as molecular pathways thattake place in the cytoplasm outside of the cell nucleus. These molecularpathways are the interaction of a set of proteins, each at particularconcentration levels, working together to elicit a particular cellular functionsuch as cell signaling, metabolism and transcription. These cellular functions may even turn genes on and off, exerting a feedbackeffect to control gene expression. So, it’s not just the genes in our DNA,located in the nucleus, that determines who we are, but the molecular pathwaysthat are in constant activity across the nucleus and cytoplasm. For example,insulin interacts with multiple molecules to provide a complex set of molecularpathways to elicit the cellular function of metabolism.A relatively new field of biological science called epigenetics has demonstratedsome remarkable events. For example, prior to the Human Genome Project it wasthought – and taught in biology classes – that because identical twins have thesame DNA, they must both look the same. Consider eye color, where both identicaltwins have genes for blue eyes. The thinking was that, by definition, both twinswould have blue eyes.However epigenetics has shown that identical twins, having the exact same DNA tocode for blue eyes, don’t necessarily have to share the same blue eye color. Howis this possible? Research in epigenetics shows that molecular pathways mayserve as the epigenome to turn on and off the genes in the DNA that codes foreye color through a feedback mechanism, not yet fully understood.This means that while DNA is important, the molecular pathways that occur acrossthe nucleus (where the DNA is stored) and the cytoplasm of the cell may be moreimportant in determining who we are, than the DNA itself.On a personal scale, this means that you may have the gene for diabetes orcertain types of cancer, but other factors are capable of suppressing theexpression of that gene. These factors include diet, environment, lifestylechoices, what we think, and ultimately our state of consciousness, a theme ofmany ancient and traditional systems of medicine. These factors affect themolecular pathways, which in turn affect gene expression.While the Human Genome Project gave us invaluable information on the genetic mapof the human genome, including the location of various genes and theirfunctions, it also provided us with knowledge that is even more far-reaching: Weare more complicated than our genes. Who we are is an emergent property of theinterconnection of our genes in the nucleus and the many molecules and proteinsinvolved in molecular pathways inside and outside of the nucleus. Thesemolecular pathways are influenced by multiple factors, which each of us can bethe true Controller of, using our mind, body and spirit.A systems approach aims to go beyond the DNA so that we can understand theentire organism and our relation to the environment and the cosmos. SystemsBiology, based on the foundational history of molecular biology, attempts tolink the dance of proteins and create a total understanding of human existencefrom DNA to RNA to Proteins, to single Protein-Protein Interactions, toMolecular Pathways to Cells, to Tissues, to Organs, to Organism, to Ecosystem –all the way to the furthest reaches of the Universe!I know that the contents of this chapter may seem technical or even esoteric.But the purpose of the chapter is actually simple and straightforward. Thepurpose is to show that you are more than the sum of your parts, even at themost basic level of your physical and biological being. [../images/00004.jpeg]Pyramid of Life’s Complexity(Oltvai and Barabasi, 2002) So don’t let anyone convince you that your destiny can be revealed by anyspecific aspect of your identity – not by your height or your weight or yourrace or your educational history or your DNA. Those factors – which exist in youin unique proportions – are always interacting with an infinite number of otherfactors in your physical, emotional, and spiritual environment.Emergent properties are constantly being born out of those interactions. You maythink you can’t play a musical instrument, but if you find the right teacher –or the right audience – you might play beautiful music. You may think you’llnever fall in love, because you never have. But love can emerge when you meetthe right person. In fact, this concept of “soul mates” is shared by spiritualtraditions around the world.Perhaps most importantly, the human experience of emergent properties can andshould exist beyond our individual identities. It happens in our cells but itdoesn’t happen only in our cells. It happens also in the experiences we sharewith other people, and the collective actions that then become possible.A revolution that unleashes all our abilities to fully experience Truth, Freedomand Health, is the ultimate possibility to advance humankind. It would be arevolution in all areas of being: in what we think, what we feel, and how welive. Although at this point it may not be possible to describe exactly what therevolution will look like, as the revolution progresses we will be able see itmore clearly – and that in itself will be an emergent property of therevolution. And let me repeat what I said at the start of this chapter. I’m anengineer. I’m less interested in philosophizing about things than in making themhappen.Does that include making a revolution? The short answer is definitely yes – butin systems terminology another term for revolution is phase transition. That’sthe subject of our next chapter."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURPHASE TRANSITIONPhase transition is an important concept in systems theory. It often refers tothe transformation of matter from one form to another – as when heat transformssolid ice to liquid water and eventually to gaseous steam. It’s of course alsotrue that phase transitions also occur in other areas – in the history of ourspecies, and even in the lives of individual human beings.In order to understand the role of phase transitions in human experience, it’shelpful to first examine how those transitions take place in the physical world.Water coming to a boil is an often used as an example. Like many other phasetransitions, that process is a combination of gradual, incremental changeculminating in a sudden and distinct transformation.At or near sea level, water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. If you watch a potof water being heated on a stove, there will be a relatively long period of timein which nothing seems to be happening. Then a few bubbles will form at thebottom of the pot, and not long afterward the water will suddenly transitioninto a full boil. The arc of the phase transformation seems to be slow, thenslightly faster, and then almost abruptly when the required temperature isreached. Suddenly the water is no longer starting to boil; it actually isboiling.Historical change seems to happen in much the same way. Dating back to theancient Greeks, there were philosophers and early scientists who taught that theEarth revolved around the sun. The Indian astronomer Aryabhata proposed much thesame thing in the fifth century AD. But the idea of heliocentrism did not really“come to a boil” in the Western world until Nicolaus Copernicus wrote Derevolutionibus in the 16th century. Heliocentrism was by no means immediatelyaccepted, but – considering how long the concept had actually been around –acceptance did happen quite rapidly.But there is a supremely important difference between these two-phasetransitions. Water coming to a boil is a purely physical process, but theCopernican transition was a change in consciousness. The Earth did not startgoing around the sun when Copernicus said it did. In fact, nothing was changedon the physical level. Instead, there was a change in people’s thinking aboutphysical reality that opened the door to enormous transformations in politics,religion, and science.Initially this manifested as chaos. There were persecutions and executions bythe Roman Catholic Church. There was an immense power struggle between thereligious establishment and the rising influence of science, which theestablishment (rightly) saw as a fundamental threat. But gradually the power of“self-organizing systems” took hold. This is the principle that instability in adynamic system will gradually resolve back toward an equilibrium – which willremain in place until the next phase transition. Despite what we might think (orwish), equilibrium is actually the most vulnerable and temporary condition inany system. Phase transitions are the real order of the day, or even ofeternity.One of the most interesting – and also frustrating – aspects of phasetransitions is how hard they are to anticipate. In the early 1950s, after WorldWar II and the explosions of nuclear bombs, Americans seemed to know that bigchanges were coming. Predicting the future was a popular media topic, and theyear 2000 was a frequent target date.The predictions were virtually always wrong. Yes, phase transitions were comingbut, no, they would not feature flying cars or rocket backpacks. Nor wouldcancer be cured, unfortunately. No one foresaw the advent of personal computers.No one mentioned the possibility of climate change. No one predicted thatnatural foods or running shoes would become billion dollar businesses andtransform society.But in the last few years something really extraordinary has happened, somethingunprecedented in human history. In the past, phase transitions were the productof brilliant minds and powerful societal forces. They developed slowly, outsidethe awareness of most people, and then they seemed to suddenly burst on thescene. Predicting them was difficult or impossible, and making predictions wasmostly done for entertainment value.Now, however, phase transitions can be manufactured! They can be sold. They canbe shoved down people’s throats by huge corporations whose marketing forces areabsolutely irresistible to millions of people.Walk down a busy street in any American city, or any city in the world for thatmatter. If five people are coming toward you, at least three of them will beusing a cell phone, and it’s likely all five will have one. Cell phones havetaken over. They’re everywhere. When people lose or break their cell phones,they experience serious withdrawal symptoms and become depressed until they getanother one.It’s almost impossible to believe that as late as 1990 there was some questionas to whether the cell phone would really catch on. Would people really want tobe getting calls anywhere and everywhere? Wouldn’t they feel like their privacywas being invaded? Would they actually want to watch videos and play games on atiny screen?Well, we now know the answer. The cell phone represents a genuine phasetransition. It’s changed everything. It’s probably driven us crazy. But mostimportantly – and unlike phase transitions of the past – the cell phone is aproduct. It has a price tag. It generates profits for corporations and theirexecutives. There’s human consciousness behind it, mostly that of Steve Jobs,rather than a vast economic force like the rise of feudalism or the hugevolcanic explosion in 1500 BC that doomed the Minoan civilization.What does this mean for you? Let’s put it in terms of systems theory. The powerbehind the scenes of phase transition is no longer some Big Controller in thesky. The intervals between phase transitions will no longer be thousands ofyears in length. Five hundred generations may have passed before it dawned onpeople that a stone could be sharpened into an axe head, but Bill Gates’ dreamof a personal computer in every home took less than twenty years. Plus, BillGates got rich. What did the inventor of the axe head get?I found all this out through personal experience. My family had emigrated fromIndia. When I invented email as a 14-year-old boy in Newark, New Jersey, myintention was to make work easier for the secretaries at the University ofMedicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. I had no idea that the RaytheonCorporation and the whole academic-corporate-governmental power structure wereintensely determined to be the Controller of the phase transition created byemail.They wanted to perpetuate their carefully formulated mythology of how innovationtakes place, who does it, and for what purpose. Innovation had to be done by anemployee of a major defense contractor, in the contractor’s facility, using thecontractor’s equipment, and as an adjunct to a project for the government or themilitary. This was the history they wanted to control – and as George Orwellwrote, if you control the past you can control the present and the future.The point is this: you have to make yourself the Controller of your own presentand future. If you don’t, there is some very powerful machinery that is set upto do that for you. You have to self-organize, for your own protection andwellbeing. You have the ability to do that and you need to use your ability tothe fullest extent.When you do that, you can begin to create a powerful emergent property, as wediscussed in chapter three. And when enough people seize Control, thatcollective emergent property will become a phase transition of its own.What will the world look like after that transition? That’s of a very importantquestion, and it’s also a highly speculative one. Even Marx, who describedhistory’s economic cycles in such minute detail, refrained from any descriptionof the world after “the withering away of the state.”But without venturing where Marx feared to tread, I have a clear vision of somekey changes that this great phase transition will bring.In the Introduction to this book, I referred to Truth, Freedom and Health ashumanity’s basic and legitimate goals. Right now, you are becoming aware of thefundamental principles that govern all systems. Your body is a system, and whenit comes to Health, you have an opportunity to take revolutionary action, hereand now, to be the Controller of your body, your system and find what is rightfor YOU, using the power of systems theory."},{"pageContent":"PART TWO"},{"pageContent":"YOUR BODY, YOUR SYSTEM "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVEKNOW YOUR SYSTEMIt’s 7:30 a.m. on a frosty New England morning. There’s a foot of new snow onthe ground and, according to the weather channel, at six degrees, thetemperature almost matches the time. Sarah is running late for her nine o’clockwriting class, but before she can leave she has to do something about snowremoval. She stayed on the phone past midnight talking to a friend about a newnovel she read; Sarah became so engrossed in the conversation that she forgot toput her car in the garage.Now, before she can go anywhere, she has to figure out how to get out of thedriveway. Sarah hates the cold weather, and it takes her a long time to dressfor it. She puts on long pants, a light thermal undershirt, a heavier shirt, awool sweater, and a light down vest. She pulls wool socks and lined boots on herfeet, wraps a thick scarf around her neck, puts a warm hat on her head beforeshe finally covers herself with a long hooded down coat and rushes out the door.Outside, Sarah sees several neighbors who are also busy dealing with the snow.She waves to James, who lives next door. He gives her a quick wave in return andyells out, “Stop running or you’ll fall.” James, whose driveway is remarkablysnow free, always makes sure that nobody else on the block beats him in the snowremoval department. James, who tends to be abrupt and a bit of a curmudgeon,approaches things very methodically and likes to shovel his driveway by handaccording to some efficiency method he once shared with Sarah. She couldn’tquite follow what he was saying, but it had something to do with incorporatingexercise reps with snow removal. She is always amazed that James never seems toget cold. Today, James is wearing light cotton pants, a long sleeved cottonshirt and a light down vest. He has nothing on his head, but he is wearing lightgloves. “Aren’t you freezing,” she yells out to him. “Nope,” he answers. “Youjust have to keep moving.” Frank, the neighbor across the street, is also out with his new snow blower. “Ifyou brush the snow off your car,” he tells her, “I’ll do your driveway. Frankisn’t very talkative. All Sarah really knows about him is that he has a largeextended family and seems to enjoy “taking care” of others. This morning, she isvery grateful that she was in his line of vision and that he is offering hishelp. However, as grateful as Sarah feels, she still wishes that Frank wouldmove a little bit faster.When we look at Sarah, James, and Frank, we see that they are very differentfrom each other, and that they approach life and its challenges differently.These differences are larger than the obvious ones of gender and age. In systemsterminology, Sarah is dominated by Transport forces; Conversion is front andcenter for James; In Frank, the forces of Structure are less obvious, but theyare nonetheless dominant.The forces of Transport, Conversion and Structure affect all forms of Matter,Energy and Information throughout nature. The strength of these forces variesfrom one life form to another. That strength also varies among individuals –including you – within a given species.The importance of these variations is being recognized by Western medicine, asbetter diagnostic tools become available and as genome research reveals theindividual character of human DNA. But the concept that every person’sphysiology is a system with an individualized balance of energies has existedfor thousands of years. This became clear to me when I received a Fulbrightgrant that allowed me to return to India for study of the ancient healthtradition known as Siddha.The Siddhars – the term means “enlightened ones” – used their own bodies asexperimental laboratories to understand the interaction of three essentialforces which they called Vata, Pitta, and Kapha.It’s surprising – or maybe it’s not surprising – that Vata, Pitta, and Kapha areexact parallels of Transport, Conversion, and Structure. Perhaps systems theoryis simply a new terminology for an ancient wisdom tradition. Whether we seeourselves as combinations of Transport, Conversion, and Structure – or of Vata,Pitta, and Kapha – each of us is a shifting and individualized balance of theseenergies. It’s a balance that needs to be continuously acknowledged, understood,and cared for. What is your Natural System State?As the three forces of nature interact within each of us, some of us have moreTransport, others are strongest in Conversion, and still others are dominated byStructure. There are even a few individuals who have an almost equal presence ofeach. The varying proportion of these forces is one of the most essential waysin which we are different from each other.Initially, you need to identify your own Natural System State. Once this hasbeen done, the goal of supporting that state becomes possible. So what is youressential nature? Which forces give direction to your being? Transport expresses itself as sensitivity to variations in flow, mobility, andmovement. If Transport is your dominant force and that force is too high, youmay feel nervous and agitated. If it’s too low, you could feel very lethargic ordepressed. Transport is in charge of everything that moves and is kinetic in ourbodies, including the flow of energy and information. Because of this, Transportis regarded as the primary force without which Conversion or Structure could notfunction. When Transport is not functioning correctly, all the other forces cango awry. Are you dominated by the force of Transport? * Do you have an exceptionally difficult time dealing with cold weather? * Do you move quickly and frequently juggle several activities at the same time? * Do you think and talk quickly? * Are you interested in fields such as communication and media? * Do you prefer spontaneity over a set of routines and scheduling? * Do you tend toward dry skin and hair or flaky scalp? * Are you naturally prone to being thin or slight in size or have a relatively easy time losing weight? * Are you happy that you are able to grasp new ideas and learn quickly but wish that you were able to remember more of what you learn? * Are you in such a rush to “get going” that you can be overly impulsive and start working on projects without thinking things through? * Do you sometimes skip meals or forget to eat? * Do you have a basically optimistic and enthusiastic attitude? * Do you have a tendency to become anxious or nervous? Conversion manifests as sensitivity to variations in physiological processessuch as metabolism and digestion, as well as analytical thinking anddecision-making. If the forces of Conversion are not functioning well, you canexperience health and emotional problems associated with the inability toconvert and transform elements of Matter, Energy and Information. Are you dominated by the force of Conversion? * Do you really, really dislike heat and hot weather? * Are you happiest when you, and those around you, stay on schedule? * Are you detail oriented and exceptionally good at processing information and data? * Do you usually think things through before taking any kind of action? * Do you metabolize food quickly and efficiently? * Do you like competition and view just about any kind of competition as an enjoyable challenge? * Do you have a medium build and does your weight tend to fluctuate? * When it comes to eating, do you prefer food that is on the bland side and/or do you find that your digestion goes awry eating spicy food? * Do you have a big appetite and do you need to eat at regular intervals? * Do you easily become impatient either with yourself or others? * Do you enjoy taking ideas and transforming them to some kind of practical application? * Are your eyes particularly sensitive to sunlight? Structure is the principle of containment for matter, information, and energy.Men and women who are Structure dominant are naturally able to sustain andtolerate more than other people. Structure forces foster relaxation and calm,and an aura of security. But when Structure is out of balance it can manifestas stubbornness or isolation. Are you dominated by the force of Structure? * Are you big boned or do you have a broad body frame? * Do you tend to be overweight or have a difficult time losing weight? * Are you happiest when you can stay in one place and do not have to move around or travel? * Are you aware of other people’s needs and are you often called upon to help others? * Are you not particularly bothered by either hot or cold weather? * Do you almost take your strong energy and good stamina for granted? * Do you get “lazy” and/or easily depressed? * Is your preferred learning style slow and steady? * Is one of your strengths your ability to retain what you’ve learned? * Do you like to take your time and resist moving from one activity to another? * Do you have problems with congestion or mucous such as sinus infections, asthma or colds? * When you speak, do you try to be precise and make a point of saying what you think? Summing up, all systems have a particular state in which they functionoptimally. But this state doesn’t happen by itself. Careful observation andconscious action are required. We have to see things as they are, in order tocreate things as we want them to be.

Once you become aware of your Natural System State, it’s yourresponsibility to keep that as close as possible to the balance point of yourlife, despite any turbulence you encounter. Health is modulated by setting theNatural System State as your Goal. Recall our original feedback systems diagram: [../images/00005.jpeg]Closed loop system with Natural Systems State as the Goal. The unfortunate fact is that at any given moment you are likely not operating atthe Goal of your Natural System State. The Eastern traditions have longrecognized this difficulty. Techniques such as yoga and meditation weredeveloped in order to refine our Sensors and develop our intuitiveunderstanding, so as to provide rapid feedback to the Controller so we remainedon track, and closer to our Natural System State and avoided large deviationsfrom our Goal, regardless of the nature of Disturbances. This became clear to mewhen I studied Siddha in India on a Fulbright grant and uncovered a directcorrelation between the language used in Eastern spiritual practices and modernWestern systems theory. [../images/00006.jpeg]Regulatory Cycle of Siddha and Ayurveda.(Ayyadurai, 2014) As the diagram illustrates, given its resemblance to the closed loop system ofmodern control systems engineering, the ancient spiritual masters of the Eastwere fundamentally systems scientists who simply used a different language tounderstand the world as a system. My research uncovered a “Rosetta Stone,”which provides a bridge between their language and the modern terminology ofsystems theory.[../images/00007.jpeg]Rosetta Stone of Siddha and Ayurveda.(Ayyadurai, 2014) So we do not have to choose between Eastern spiritual practices and Westernobjective science. We should embrace and use them both because at the core,their origin is in systems science, which is invariant across the ages. Integrating techniques across East and West is the key to unlocking the secretsof optimal mental, physical, and spiritual health, based on a systemsperspective. How are you right now?How are you feeling today? Is everything going well in your life? Do you feelupbeat and cheerful or do you feel down in the dumps? Are you feeling healthy?Or are you catching a cold? As a unique and dynamic person, you are not going to be feeling the same everyday. Here are some questions to help you get a handle on what the forces ofTransport, Conversion, and Structure are doing in your system right now. Youranswers will help you determine which forces are “off-course.” You can then decide how you want to bring that force back into alignment usingthe Inputs discussed earlier. Are your Transport forces undergoing disturbances? * Is your sleep pattern disturbed? Are you having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep? * Have you been making any noticeably impulsive decisions or do you find yourself talking almost non-stop? * Are you having issues with joint or arthritic pain? * Are you sometimes spacing out or are you having a difficult time concentrating or finishing projects? * Is cold weather bothering you even more than usual? * Are you sometimes forgetting to eat or are you losing weight? * Is your lower GI tract upset? Are you having bouts of diarrhea or constipation? Are you experiencing gas or a sensation of bloating? * How about your skin? Do you have any dry spots, chapped, or cracked skin? * Is your energy level noticeably uneven? Are you feeling depressed or do you have bursts of energy so intense that you have a hard time calming down? * Are your emotions on the overwrought side? Have you been feeling particularly anxious, jumpy, or overly excited? Are your Conversion forces undergoing disturbances? * Are you experiencing strong feelings of jealousy or a need to get even? * How is your skin? Are you getting more rashes, acne, or cold sores than usual? * On a scale of one to ten, is your impatience level at about a twelve? * Is your food or liquid intake out of control? Do you feel ravenously hungry, or even a little sick to your stomach, if your meals are even a little late? Do you drink large quantities of water or other beverages? * Have you become noticeably sarcastic, competitive, argumentative, or critical of others? Are your friends telling you to 'chill out'? * Are you easily angered? * Are you having problems with your eyes? Are they bloodshot, strained, or do you feel you need even stronger sunglasses than usual? * Is your natural aversion to heat becoming more intense? * Are you having upper GI problems? Are you suffering from heartburn, GERD, or a sore throat that your doctor thinks is being caused by acid reflux? * Is your quest for perfection becoming even more intense? Are you putting too much pressure on yourself or others? Are your Structure forces undergoing disturbances? * Are you responding to stress by giving people the silent treatment or generally shutting them out of your life? * Are you finding it almost impossible to start new projects or make changes in your life? * Do you feel a need to accumulate more stuff you don't need? * Are you having an exceptionally difficult time letting go of things ranging from people and emotions to old newspapers and unnecessary objects? * Are you procrastinating? Do you have a list of things to do that you keep putting off? * Are you generally feeling lethargic and dull? * Do you have a white coat on your tongue? * Do you want to sleep all the time? * Are you having an impossible time keeping your weight under control? Do you find it impossible to resist carbs, chocolate, or other sweets? * Do you seem to have even more mucous issues such as sinusitis, allergies, chest congestion or asthma attacks than usual? By knowing which force or forces are disturbed, you can be the Controller,making adjustments to Inputs that will bring you back to your Natural SystemState. But the first step is to correctly assess what’s wrong. What is the truenature of the disturbance? Be real. Don’t look for an easy answer, neither inreductionist science nor reassuring mysticism."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENADJUSTING INPUTS TO YOUR SYSTEM“Garbage in, garbage out” was an early principle of computer science. It’sshould also be a maxim for anyone who wants to understand systems theory andapply it to their lives. If your Input is garbage, there’s not much that can bedone with it. But assuming you’re bringing the right energies into your system,the next step is optimizing the forces of Transport, Conversion, and Structurethat process and sustain those energies. Controlling the Forces of TransportTransport is expressed through movement. When it’s in balance, Transportpresents itself as joy, grace, agility and enthusiasm. Both systems theory andSiddha identify three Inputs as essential for Transport to function at anoptimal level: warmth, rhythm and lubrication. Stay WarmOur bodies, particularly our muscles, work far more efficiently when they arewarmed up before any kind of activity or exercise. Muscles contract and relaxfaster when they are warm. Warmth gives your muscles greater agility, speed, andstrength. Warming up is like an insurance policy, decreasing the possibility ofinjury while also allowing you a greater degree of motion. If you are warm, yourblood vessels are dilated, and this reduces stress on your heart and increasesthe flow (movement) of blood throughout your body. Blood is the key transporterof nutrients in your body. When you stay warm, your blood is able to be moreefficient and deliver more oxygenated blood, making your entire system moreeffective to support motion at multiple levels. It also enables oxygen in yourblood to be transported at a greater speed.Your joints are key to movement and motion. Staying warm enables you to have awide range of motion. Stiffness, for example, is a symptom that Transport is notworking right. Warmth increases production of synovial fluids in your joints,serving to reduce friction, to support that range of motion. Greater range ofmotion gives you the greater confidence to try new things in a safe manner.Staying warm helps your body secrete the hormones that enable energy production,which is key to Transport. Exhaustion is another symptom telling us that theforces of Transport are not functioning right.Movement can be erratic and chaotic, methodical and elegant, or graceful andintelligent. Staying warm enables nerve impulses to be transported at greaterspeeds, resulting in greater focus. This focus in turn will support the rightlevel of concentration in a relaxed manner to provide support for gracefulmotion.In order to thrive, Transport needs the Input of warmth. Think about your car onthe coldest winter morning. Most of us will go out and warm it up beforedriving off. The warmth we are talking about is inner warmth, inside of theengine, inside of the car, inside of you. Warm friends, a warm home, and a warmdisposition all fuel your inner forces of Transport. By doing those things thatbuild such inner warmth, you directly support the optimal functioning ofTransport. Stay in RhythmA sense of rhythm is the ability to move your body to a regular beat. Rhythm orregularity is key to optimal motion and Transport. A person who dances wellmoves to a regular rhythm. A great drummer follows a great beat. Musicians oftentrain with a metronome, an instrument that puts out a constant beat, to helpthem keep their rhythm. One of my mentors Frank Zane, the great body builder,taught me to lift weights to a metronome, or to a beat. When one does this, itmakes it much easier, and more fluid. One can move and Transport with greaterease.Because the force of Transport drives so many important body processes, itrequires this level of regularity. Breathing, digestion and elimination are alldependent on proper rhythm and regularity. Having a regular schedule, eating atregular times, and sleeping and waking regularly are all about being in rhythm,which makes Transport far more effective. As someone said, “repetition is themother of skill.”Siddha masters recommended that their students follow a schedule – early to bed,early to rise – routinized meal times, and play and work at particular hours.They were very demanding about the need for such regularity. In fact, in allspiritual practices, regularity is more important than the length of practice.Some people will meditate for 2 hours for a few weeks, and then stop, withoutany semblance of discipline. It is better to do less, but with consistency toachieve the best results. The highest level of rhythm and regularity iscritical for the force of Transport.In our breathing, the forces of Transport manifest themselves most clearly.Without breath our entire being ceases to exist. In the Bible, it is said thatlife began when God breathed into Adam’s nostrils. The breath we have has arhythm and regularity. That rhythm regularizes our pulse, our heart beat and ournerves. Emotions such as anger change our rhythm, and affect the forces ofTransport. Every time we move or exercise, this is an exercise in breath. Breathis a gateway for us to see the force of Transport in action, and a way tomeasure our regularity, moment to moment. Stay LubricatedSmooth and agile motion is supported by lubrication. All machines move betterwhen they are well lubricated. Think about it. Your car will not move withoutoil and regular oil changes. Nor will you. To support Transport, your body needsto be well lubricated. Lubrication supports our joints, enables cellularmotion, lessens build-up of plaque in our arteries, and ensures that nerveimpulses fire right. Across a range of internal cellular processes, Transport needs lubrication.Without lubrication, the machinery of our bodies begins to squeak, get tight,rust, and motion stops. That squeaking door in your kitchen needs some oil. The stiffness in your joints would also benefit from some lubrication.Lubrication removes friction and ensures long-life of machinery, including yourinner machinery.The right kinds of oils and fats, and proper hydration support that lubrication.Wonderful research is being done and continues to be done on the value ofdifferent kinds of wholesome plant and animal based fats and oils. Doing yourown research on them can prove to be invaluable. Healthy fats and oils play anoverall role in supporting the forces of Transport. They contribute to anincrease in energy and help us gain muscle mass. They also support thefunctioning of our heart, lungs, brain and digestive organs – all componentsinvolved in Transport. The right lubrication makes our internal motors of motionthat move air, blood, electrical signals run with ease and minimal friction.Healthy fats help protect our heart, a motor-like pump, from cardiovasculardiseases. Our bones and skeletal structure keep us moving as we walk and run. Lubricationof the right kind has been shown to strengthen bone density and reduceincidences of fractures, so as we age, we can still keep moving. Your skin is amajor organ of transporting fluids and substances such as hormones, lymph, andwater. Hydration, which is a form of lubrication, is key to supporting movementof those fluids and substances to support the forces of Transport.The right kind of lubrication also supports internal cellular signaling, and theright signaling is key to cellular communication. Wrong communication resultsin illness and disease. Repeated studies have shown the value of lubrication atthe cellular level to protect against various forms of cancer. Lubricationprotects our machinery from rusting – a process known in chemistry asoxidation. That bicycle chain in your backyard has oxidized and is rusty. Put some oil onit, clean it up, and it’s as good as new. Similarly, oils that are known asanti-oxidants can help remove the “rust” from our internal motors so Transportforces are able to glide smoothly. Nerve signaling, a type of cellularsignaling, affects mood disorders. Stress affects nerve signaling and may resultin increased depression and anxiety. The right kind of lubrication increaseslevels of serotonin in the body. Serotonin makes people feel good and puts themin a relaxed state. Being relaxed supports agile Transport. Controlling the Forces of ConversionThe forces of Conversion are expressed as intensity and determination. Whenthree key Inputs are present, Conversion presents itself as enterprising, brave,intelligent, ambitious, confident, and self-disciplined. These three Inputs areessential for Conversion to function at an optimal level: being cool, regulatedand clean. Stay CoolLet’s start with an enlightened awareness that intensity (fire) doesn’t needmore intensity (or fire). Fighting fire with fire doesn’t work here. Theprocess of Conversion does the job of converting Matter, Energy and Informationfrom one form into another. These processes all require “heat.” However, inorder to operate efficiently, they also need proper cooling.A nuclear reactor, which is able to convert nuclear fission to thermal energy,is a classic example of Conversion. But a nuclear reactor needs those bigcooling towers we see when pictures of reactors are shown. Your hot kitchenneeds an exhaust system to keep it cool; your computer needs a fan to keep itcool. Men and women with rapid metabolism and fiery dispositions – expressions ofConversion in action – need to stay cool, in both mind and body, to balancetheir internal engines. Those with Conversion dominance need to look to theexternal world for ways to input cooling factors. This is different from thosewith a Transport dominance, who need to Input ways of increasing internalwarmth. Conversion dominant people need to avoid “hot situations” that can cause tempersto flare; they need to learn to “cool down” during those times when theintensity of action (during tough business negotiations, for example) becomestoo extreme. Staying Cool ensures that you don’t over-heat and burn up yourinternal engines, which are the power source of Conversion.Warm-blooded animals sweat (like a human) or pant (like a dog) to dissipate heatthrough water evaporation. Sometimes it’s easy just to cool off by going undera nice shaded tree or get some water on us. Other times it may be good just totake a vacation, “chill out” and go to cooler areas. Sometimes just sitting andwatching the sunrise or sunset or other forms of Nature’s beauty can serve toprovide the cool to calm down and support the forces of Conversion, to removethe “heat.” Stay RegulatedThe forces of Conversion are involved in the process of transformation andtransduction. They convert energy from one form to another. The retinas in youreyes convert light, electromagnetic radiation, to chemical impulses which aretransduced to “see” the world. The engine in your car converts chemical energyto rotational mechanical energy.All of these involve many systematic and interconnected processes that need tobe regulated correctly, with great sensitivity, to make sure that the inputs areconverted to the right outputs. If your retina does not transduce correctly, you get blurred vision. If your carengine’s pistons are not regulated with the right mixture of fuel and air tofire correctly, your car’s motion could be abrupt with backfiring. All enginesneed to regulate their activity from action to rest, from focused work toregular maintenance – in short they need to be in balance across the forces ofmotion and stillness.Conversion can create a tendency to push too hard. They gravitate toward beingon the go all the time, with extreme activity and little rest. If they don’tlearn how to regulate their activities, they run the risk of “burning up” and“burning out”. Sometimes, this inability to regulate their own internal engines,results in an attempt to control everything, and everybody, in theirenvironment. It would be better for them to learn how to control and regulatetheir own activities. It can be difficult for a conversion dominant person to “let go” and relax,either by themselves or with others. Their tongues can become harsh and mean –an inappropriate way to control a situation, because in reality they are notable to control themselves. Extremes of this out-of-control behavior includethrowing tantrums, becoming manipulative, all of which reflect a lack ofself-regulation, which can backfire much like a car engine, whose internalpistons misfire. High performance jet engines are designed to function well. They are able to operate across a wide range of temperatures and altitudes. They can regulate their performance across a variety of conditions, can adjustand adapt. Conversion forces require proper regulation to ensure their optimalfunctioning.Regulation includes setting bounds of operation. Those who are dominated byConversion forces can achieve great success, if they are given, or create forthemselves, internal and external boundaries. A high performance car also hasits boundaries - if you “red-line” above a certain number of RPM’s, the enginewill conk out. The forces of Conversion operate well within their lower andupper bounds.Work and rest are therefore equally important for these forces of Conversion. Forces of Conversion, like a motor can “be on” all the time, and not know whento stop. Men and women with strong Conversion forces have a tendency to overdojust about everything. They can work too hard, they can exercise too much, andthey can overdo it with their attention to detail. Our Conversion dominantfriends sometimes need to relax and stop competing. They need to learn tomodulate their behavior, keeping everything more reasonable and moderate.Regulating your behavior also implies being able to “surrender” and “go withflow” at appropriate times. Those with dominant Conversion forces can sometimesappear always to be on “high alert” in terms of a need to control the people andthings in their environment. They need to learn how to regulate their behaviorby stepping back and surrendering. It’s essential to know when to stop, relax,rest, and shut down. Stay CleanLike any high performance engine, forces of Conversion thrive in a cleanenvironment. This includes both high quality fuel and a clean internalmechanism. People dominated by Conversion need to be very careful about whatthey input into their bodies. Whole foods, organic, without preservatives, andwithout additives are wonderful because they provide “clean” fuel. There is an emerging movement among pioneering food manufacturers in formalizingthe definition of such clean foods through a newly developed CertifiedC.L.E.A.N. international standard, which I helped to facilitate using asystems-based approach that defines such foods as ones that have multipleattributes including being safe, non-GMO, organic, and having highbio-availability of nutrients. Keeping an eye out for such clean foods can serveto support Conversion.Food combining is another wise strategy for ensuring effective transformationwithin our digestive systems. Slow-cooked foods, in many ways pre-digested,make it easy for our internal engine to absorb nutrients. In addition, regularand moderate fasts allow our engines to clean and heal themselves by support thebody’s own self-healing processes. Controlling the Forces of StructureStructure brings stability, and stability is essential for survival. Men andwomen in whom Structure is dominant tend to have stability in their own livesand they like to provide it for others as well. The three Inputs that encourageStructure’s optimal performance are: being dry, active and flexible. Stay DryThe force of Structure provides containment and support. When a home is built,the foundation represents the Structure force that holds the entire house. Ifthe foundation (or basement) is damp or wet, the building’s entireinfrastructure is at risk.Excessive dampness in your body’s foundation can show up as cysts, tumors,chronic sinus infections, and yeast infections. Dryness can also have thebenefit of slightly raising the body’s temperature, creating a structuralenvironment that is resistant to viruses and bacteria. A dry sauna, for example,can be ideal for supporting Structure. Stay ActiveUse it or lose it. Any physical structure, including the human body, getsstronger the more it gets used and stimulated. If you don’t use your muscles,your skeletal structure, you atrophy. Structures that are not used arevulnerable to decay and rust. Various types of stimuli are critical in keeping astructure activated.At the cellular level, the cell membrane and cytoskeleton, support structure ofthe entire cell. Nature ensures that this structure is under constant stimulito keep it vigilant and active. Such activity increases the number ofmacrophages. Macrophages enhance the immune system and support structure bykilling invading bacteria and viruses. Physical activity also increases blood flow, allowing antibodies to move throughyour system and attack and remove bacteria and viruses. For those who sufferfrom inflammation, anti-inflammatory cytokines, which are the cell-to-cellsignaling molecules, are themselves activated by physical activity. Thesemolecules have a beneficial effect in promoting anti-inflammatory effects. Thisis one of the important benefits that come from being active because chronicinflammation causes most of the degenerative diseases such as cancer.The forces of Structure provide framework and inertia. This inertia can alsoresult, at its extremes, in laziness, moodiness, and immobility. Sometimesthose who are dominant in the forces of Structure “just don’t feel like moving.”Inertia and a lack of movement can contribute to a sense of depression orlethargy. Exercise and physical activity stimulates neurotransmitters in thebrain to make one feel happier, less moody, and less depressed. Inertia is alsoimplicated in osteoporosis, a structural disorder that causes bone loss.Exercise and physical activity is prescribed as a treatment for those who haveosteoporosis or are in danger of getting it because it can help prevent andarrest the problem.In order to hold things, Structure itself requires containment. The tendency to“holding on” often spells out issues with weight. Being active is a greatcontrolling and modulating factor to manage one’s weight. There is no bettercure for the inertia and laziness of Structure forces than to boost one’s energylevel through physical activity. Diseases such as diabetes manifest when theforces of Structure go to its extremes of containment. Being active can be helpdeal with this condition. Activity helps makes the body more sensitive toinsulin, to support burning of glucose e.g. calories. This helps to lower bloodglucose and stop sugar spikes. Diabetics who exercise have been shown to needless insulin or medication than those who don’t.People with Structure dominance can also become too complacent and reliant onthe status quo. They have a tendency to not want to “let go” of anything,including relationships and objects. They can “hold on” to relationships,situations, and things that no longer have value in their lives.Activity—getting out in the world, meeting new people, and trying new things—isa way of fighting this tendency. Stay FlexibleStructure contains the elements of water and earth. Structures composed of waterand earth can get stuck, muddy, swampy, and immobile. The most powerfulstructures in the world are not rigid, but flexible. If something is too hard,it can become brittle, and just shatter and break. In civil engineering, whenlarger structures are built, particularly in earthquake zones, they are designedto sway and be flexible; sometimes they are even put on rollers, so they willmove with the wave of the earthquake. The largest modern skyscrapers in theworld now actually flex like pine grass in the wind. This is a wonderful example of how flexibility can provide additional strengthand make structures strong enough to withstand even the most powerful ofNature’s forces. Similarly, flexibility is key for someone who is Structuredominant. If you become too stiff, you too can break or fall apart by life’scontinual and ongoing disturbances and changes. If you become too set in yourways, you might end up feeling as though you are stuck in a quagmire thatresembles nothing so much as a muddy swamp.Flexibility gives structures greater strength. Joints and fascia areparticularly improved by flexibility. Blood flow can be increased by flexibilityexercises such as stretching, which removes toxins and waste products that cancause a structure to “squeak” and get stiff.Stretching the joints also results in improved blood flow, which, in turn, cancause slight increases in tissue temperature; this supports circulation andincreases the flow of rich nutrients to the joints creating greater elasticityand higher levels of structural performance. Flexibility allows structures to be more effective in dealing with environmentaldisturbances. My grandmother used to tell a story of two kinds of trees. Onetree would bend when a river flooded and was able to go back to its originalshape once the waters receded. The other tree would resist the flood and wouldultimately be broken, ripped out from its roots. Structures that bend are morelikely to survive. Scientists have repeatedly shown how flexible structures can adjust themselvesto reduce drag. It is clear that that unlike rigid structures for which anincrease in velocity causes a squared increase of drag, the increase in drag fora flexible object is significantly lower. ***Above all, be aware of the core message of this chapter. It’s yourresponsibility – and your opportunity – to become fully aware of the dominantenergies of your being, and your Goal is to keep them in balance to support yourNatural System State, not someone else’s. Remember too that balance is not apassive state. It’s achieved through strong action, and strong action isrequired to sustain it as well. There’s a teaching by Vivekananda, one ofIndia’s contemporary spiritual masters, that alludes to this. Despite hismetaphysical orientation, Vivekananda advised his students that if there was achoice between doing 50 pushups and meditating for 50 minutes, do the pushups!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEXTERNAL ADJUSTMENTS:YOU ARE NOT THE UNIVERSEThe concept that connected elements can form a closed, self-sustaining unit is aprinciple of systems theory. But no system is completely self-contained. Everysystem is part of a larger system that ultimately includes, on one end, the mostdistant galaxies and on the other end trillions of infinitely small sub-atomicparticles. As a result, we can’t really understand a system until we see it inthe larger context.That accuracy isn’t always easy to obtain. For example, a document known as theAlmagest, written around the year 100 A.D., is one of history’s most influentialtreatises on astronomy. The author was Claudius Ptolemy, a Roman citizen wholived in Egypt. The Almagest offers a complete and highly detailed descriptionof the universe as a system, based on observable phenomena such as the risingand setting of the sun.At the core of the complex Ptolemaic system, however, is a single basic premise:the planet Earth does not move. Instead, everything in the universe moves aroundthe planet Earth. Consequently, although the Ptolemy’s Almagest does explain theobservable phenomena, the explanation is wrong. The system is comprehensive,convincing, and even beautiful, but it is factually incorrect.Despite this incorrectness, a geocentric model of the universe connected withdeep human needs, and also with issues of political power. A system that placeshuman beings at the center of the universe is obviously reassuring, or perhapsflattering, compared to viewing ourselves and our planet as just another grainof sand on a huge seashore.In addition, Ptolemy’s viewpoint seemed in accord with Biblical teachings.Therefore it supported and justified the chief interpreter of the Bible – thePope of the Roman Catholic Church.Today we have our own doctrines, many of which can be just as convincing as thePtolemaic system. The concept of genes being the central Controller of our liveswas one of them. Today, we know that this is not true. Who we are emerges fromthe molecular interaction of genes, proteins, and many other molecules, across amassive network of systems of systems, from cell to tissue to organ all the wayto our whole body and all the external systems that surround us.In fact our bodies are not just composed of our 10 trillion human cells but alsoand more importantly of 1000 trillion foreign microorganisms. We are not just“our” body, but are carrying a whole ecosystem of us and 100 times more foreigntravelers (or are they carrying us?) We are NOT at the center of ourselves, buta peripheral part of something much larger. We are only 1/100th of “ourselves.”Danger however arises when vast political, social, and financial power becomesconnected to a particular dogma, which then must be seen as “obvious” and“beyond question.”The truth is, nothing should be obvious and beyond question. Life is dynamic andchanging. Nothing is constant. In Woody Allen’s film Annie Hall, his characterturns to Diane Keaton and says, “A relationship is like a shark. It has toconstantly move or it dies.”We are constantly moving, or we ought to be. We need to expand our awareness andcontinually take action. In Part Two, we’ve focused on balancing internalenergies. But our inner selves exist in an external context. It’s not enough totake responsibility for eating healthy and getting enough sleep. Becomingpreoccupied with your own self-development and maintenance is a real danger ifit leads to ignoring the world at large.The plain fact is, there is injustice in the world and history’s most evolvedhuman beings have taken action against it. In the New Testament’s Gospel ofLuke, even Jesus said, “I came to set the world on fire and I wish it werealready burning.”If you want to use tools like Your Body, Your System® (YBYS) to know your systemstate, how disturbances affect your health, and how adjustments can help youachieve better health, this is great. You will at least take matters into yourhand and be a revolutionary in understanding your body as a system. However,know that this is just the beginning. You are NOT the center of creation, justas the Earth is not the center of the Universe. You are a very small part of asystem with many interconnections. It’s not enough to buy organically grownfoods, and to condemn GMOs. We have to look deeper. What companies make moneyfrom GMOs? How are those companies connected to academia and government?Being a revolutionary seeking Truth, Freedom and Health means being accountableto all areas in any area of your life. There is little benefit in perfectingyourself if you allow governments or corporations to degrade the world aroundyou. We can accept the rule of politicians and demagogues, of reductionistdoctors and New Age gurus, and just hope for the best. Or we can collectivelyknow our bodies and ourselves as interconnected systems. We can start takinglocal action, which can ultimately magnify its effects as a global PhaseTransitions – Revolutions.Remember that your own wellbeing is both an end and a means. Even Buddhareturned to the world when he saw that his enlightenment was not sufficient.When enough people do likewise, the universal system, of which we’re all a part,will at last reach a collective fulfillment. "},{"pageContent":"PART THREETHE REVOLUTION"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETHE IMITATION OF LIFEIn the early 20th century the pragmatist philosopher William James compared theworld to a bunch of stones poured out on a table. Looking at the stones,different people may have entirely different impressions.One person might count the stones and conclude that the number of stones was themost important thing about them. Someone with a more artistic sense could findpatterns in the stones, like the image of an animal. A mystic might say that thestones are only an illusion we’re all sharing.William James states that, from a purely intellectual standpoint, none of theseobservations can be called false. They’re all equally true as long as they existonly as thoughts in the minds of the observers.But if someone actually tries to do something with the stones beyond justthinking about them, the situation changes. The arrangement of the stones mightlook like a dog, but we can’t take it for a walk. Or we might think that thestones are an illusion, or that the table is an illusion, or even thateverything in the world is an illusion – but if we jump out of the window, itwon’t be an illusion when we hit the ground.An engineer is someone who would try to make something useful out of the stones.An engineer might try to connect the stones so that they became a paperweight oran ashtray or – if there were enough stones – the pavement of a street. Inshort, an engineer would identify a purpose for the stones. It may be that thepurpose existed beforehand, or possibly the engineer is creating it from thestart. To the engineer, that distinction doesn’t really matter. The engineerwill make the stones part of a system.In Chapter One, we defined a system as “a set of objects or energies workingtogether for a specific goal or purpose.” That may seem like a reasonabledescription of a wristwatch or even a university, but how far can we extend it?Is a bunch of stones a system, or how can it become one? Is human history asystem? Does history have a goal? Does the universe have a purpose? Does naturebehave as an engineer, with a directed goal and purpose?These are profound questions. Some very important scientists would answer withan emphatic “no.” Steven Weinberg was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in1979. One of his best known quotes is, \"The more we know of the cosmos, the moremeaningless it appears.\" This seems to suggest that believing there is a purposeto the universe is a primitive concept – and as we learn more about theuniverse, we get further and further away from that belief.Questions about purpose also exist in other areas of science. Jean BaptisteLamarck, for example, a French naturalist, wrote that animals could alter theirphysical and genetic characteristics during their lifetimes, in order to servespecific purposes. A giraffe, for example, driven by its objective of easieraccess to food could lengthen its neck in order to stretch for leaves moreeffectively, and the characteristic of a longer neck would then be passed on toits offspring,More than fifty years later, in 1859, Charles Darwin proposed a different theoryof evolution based on a fundamental randomness. Darwin’s principle of naturalselection does not teach that giraffes evolved long necks in order to eat leavesfrom the tops of trees. Instead, one day a genetic accident took place and agiraffe with a longer neck was born. That accident gave the long-necked giraffean evolutionary advantage; it was better able to survive and thrive. When itreproduced other long-necked giraffes, they too benefitted from that advantageand eventually all giraffes had long necks. But according to Darwin the processbegan with a random genetic mutation that became an inherited characteristic.The mutation did not come into being because of any desire, purpose, plan, orintention. My work in organizational and biological systems has provided me with a uniqueinsight, a “middle path” that resolves the contradiction between Darwin andLamarck. Goals, intentions, desires – whether at the macro or micro level,across all spatial and temporal scales of any system – are not just random, butemerge from the interaction of a system within itself, and also from itsexternal system interactions. This means that goals themselves are an emergentproperty. While Lamarck may have not gotten it right, Darwin’s notion that everything israndom is also incorrect. The reality is that Darwin’s giraffe did not get along neck from pure randomness, nor did Lamarck’s giraffe get its neck fromstretching upward for leaves. Instead, the interaction of multiple systemsresulted in the “goal” of the giraffe wanting to get a longer neck. Theinteraction of the genes, the environment, the ecosystem, the trees, andcountless other systems resulted in the emergence of that goal. In fact, datarepeatedly and consistently shows that if it were pure randomness, Darwin’sgiraffe would have taken much longer to appear, and likely never would haveappeared at all. This has been one of the kinks in Darwin’s work that hasallowed religious “creationists” to attack his theory of evolution. Once again, a systems approach that recognizes the nature of systems interactingand unfolding onto themselves reveals that goals and purposes are emergentproperties. This point, though subtle, must not be underestimated. Take a momentto absorb this principle, which resolves many of the deepest issues of destinyand free will. Our personal goals and desires are themselves emergent propertiesof our interactions with ourselves and the systems that surround us. My desire, my need, and my purpose to expose corruption and to fight againstexploitation – while at some level under my control – is also something I amcompelled to do because of my unique path in life. That compelling desire is anemergent property of myself as a system, which has interacted with a multitudeof other systems within systems, many of which are beyond my control. Yourjourney is also such. For all of us – as a system of human beings on this planet, who interact withmany other systems – collective goals may emerge. Goals for Truth, Freedom andHealth? Or for Profit, Control and Vanity? Whatever it might be, the Goal iswhat the system’s Controller modulates, until that Goal is achieved.The concept of telos – Greek for “objective” or “purpose” – has been debatedover the years. While Karl Marx did not address the ultimate fate of theuniverse, he did see a clear direction and end point for human economic andsocial behavior. Marx taught that we are inexorably heading toward a kind ofutopia – an ideal era of freedom and equality for everyone. But in all his manythousands of pages, Marx describes neither what this will actually look like,nor the origin of that “goal” or purpose. Perhaps he would have argued that noone living now is capable of describing it, any more than an ant can describethe geography of South America. Marx’s inability to define the dynamics andsource of his system’s goal has been exploited by many in the reactionary andliberal bourgeois academic priesthood to slander, discredit and undermine Marx’svast contributions.Today, advocates for so-called intelligent design assert that there is indeed aplan, and that someone or something is pulling the strings of nature. This viewis discredited by mainstream science because intelligent design advocates do notgive a clear rational explanation for such a plan. However, the nascent scienceof epigenetics is showing that genetic characteristics do not exist entirelyindependent of interactions with the external environment. Experimental evidencefrom biological research is demonstrating that goals themselves are an emergentproperty of system interactions. Epigenetics demonstrates that specific eventsand interactions across multiple systems can turn an animal’s genes on and off,with dramatic consequences in the animals behavior.This was documented in an experiment at McGill University, in which a group ofmice was bred for a gene that mandated docile behavior. It was found, however,that when their mothers did not lick subsets of the mice after birth, the mousepups exhibited agitation and aggression. More importantly, molecular pathwaysturned genes on and off at the cellular level in those mouse pups. This alteredtheir genetics in ways that were later transferred to their offspring, makingthe offspring also aggressive.From a systems perspective, this means that a mouse’s behavioral “goal” of angeror serenity is not written in stone in its cells. Instead, the mouse’s behaviorand even its genetic characteristics emerge from the interactions of the variousparts of its existence as a system. The system’s “goal” is an emergent propertyand its final purpose depends on the various system interactions.In his philosophy of history, Marx was like someone who holds up an acorn andsays, “Look, this is going to turn into an oak tree.” To a person who knewnothing about how trees develop, this would seem impossible and absurd. Howcould a huge tree be contained in a tiny seed? How could something so largeemerge from something so small? Those are good questions. Actually, that acorn emerges as a tree only when itinteracts with and becomes part of a much larger system. The acorn must beplanted in the ground, and it must be nourished by rain, and sunlight. It isfrom those multiple systems’ interactions that the acorn’s “goal” to become atree emerges.Marx believed that there is a system in human history, just as there is inacorns turning into oaks. This wasn’t a matter of morality or aesthetics. WhenMarx wrote, little was known about the foundations of systems theory. But today,based on those foundations, it is self-evident that a system exists in economicsjust as it does in nature – and the defining attribute of a system is thepurposeful movement toward a final goal. This attribute emerges from thesystem’s interaction with itself and with the systems that surround it.The Greek word mimesis is important for understanding this systems-basedapproach to civilization’s development. It provides a foundation to appreciatethe insights that Marx elucidated nearly 200 years ago. Mimesis means imitation.Bio-mimesis is the imitation of natural systems in order to achieve human goals.Comparing human history to the acorn-oak continuum is a biomimetic concept.Marxism took a natural process like evolution and translated it into action inthe realm of human affairs. Just as a newborn infant changes into a full-grownadult, Marx envisioned society transforming from hunter-gatherers to farmers toindustrial workers and capitalist masters – and ultimately into people who aftermany centuries at last fulfill the destiny of humanity.Examples of bio-mimesis are easy to find both in history and in the contemporaryworld. The British World War Two fighter plane called the Spitfire, for example,had wings designed to replicate the wings of a seagull. Velcro uses thousands oftiny hooks like those of thistles and burrs. Engineers study natural systems toextract principles from which they can engineer new systems. Since we are partof nature, it makes sense that the best systems we create are those that follownature’s engineering principles, honed over billions of years of trial anderror. Similarly, by understanding your body, a biological system, you can extract andexperience the foundational engineering system principles of Transport,Conversion, and Structure that the body uses to achieve and sustain goals. Thegoals include growth in your early years, defense against illness or infectionlater on, and survival for as long as possible.So far, so good. But there’s a certain aspect of the natural world that needs tobe emphasized here. It’s a principle of nature that demands mimesis. It needs tobe recognized and imitated in the important areas of our lives. We do not livein a biological or behavioral vacuum. Every aspect of our existence emerges fromthe principle of mimesis, the imitation of nature."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENBEYOND THE CENTERA critical question now arises: who directs the Goal of a system? For manyyears, a deep and underlying assumption is that a Goal is controlled from “thecenter outward” or “from the top down.” According to this line of thought, asmall, centrally organized entity issues directives to an external realm in theperiphery, and that’s how great things happen. From a biomimetic perspective,biology for nearly fifty years called this the “central dogma theory,”originally put forth by James Watson and Francis Crick, the discoverers of DNA.The nucleus was described as the central Controller that directs the goals ofthe entire cell. However, all this changed in cellular biology around 2002, as Ireferenced in Chapter Three: The Human Genome Project revealed that the complexity of human beings cannot beexplained by looking at our DNA alone. We especially need to consider the danceof proteins and molecules, known as molecular pathways that take place in thecytoplasm outside of the cell nucleus. This may seem to concern only biology, but science is not separate from historyor politics. When Galileo argued for a heliocentric solar system, nothingchanged on the physical level. The sun seemed to rise and set just as it alwayshad. So why was the Catholic Church profoundly threatened by Galileo’s doctrine?It was the philosophical and political implications of heliocentrism that causedthe uproar. It was the idea that mankind was not the center of the universe.Therefore the Church, which cast itself as the central force in people’s lives,was not the center of the center.Galileo asserted that human life was happening on the periphery. Our world wasno longer the center. The Church was literally marginalized, pushed off to theside of the solar system in a way that seemed to fundamentally diminish itspower.In the quote above about the Genome Project, the periphery is also beingelevated at the expense of the center. The cytoplasm and the cell membrane, notthe nucleus of the cell, is where the action is. This insight will not cause meto be arrested by the Holy Inquisition as happened to Galileo, but here too thehuman instinct toward “top down” thinking is called into question.Faced with a new or mysterious phenomenon, the human imagination seems to jumpto a specific conclusion: there must be a center of power; there must be acentral leader; there must be an Inside that takes precedence over the Outside.Or maybe it’s not the human imagination that defaults into that viewpoint. Maybesomeone or something occupies the center, and then promotes that occupation asthe natural state of things.And people are usually ready to believe that. It seems so simple. There’s aleader and there are followers. There’s a king and there are his subjects.There’s a cell nucleus and there’s the rest of the cell.But I want to say loud and clear that, first, this way of thinking is a grossoversimplification of the natural world. It’s an erroneous and false observationof bio-mimesis, and the opposite of reality, just as the Earth is not the centerof the solar system. Secondly, it has dangerous and destructive politicalimplications.I know this from firsthand experience. When the revolution in high technologywas bursting onto the scene in the 1970s, the military-industrial-academiccomplex naturally wanted to promote itself and position itself at the center ofthat revolution. The most important innovations had to come from that center sothat, among other things, the public could see that its billions of tax dollarswere well spent.Toward this end, an engineer employed by the Raytheon Corporation, a majordefense contractor, was cast as the inventor of email. Since email is arguablyone of the most important developments in the history of human communication,the Raytheon engineer – his name was Ray Tomlinson – was cast into this role. Heseemed perfect for the part. He came across as a brilliant tinkerer who inventedemail without any sense of its importance. He had an “aw shucks” manner and ifhe didn’t’ have a white plastic pocket guard in the pocket of his plaid shirt,it definitely seemed like he should have.Despite its appeal to Raytheon and the powers-that-be, there was significant anddeliberate misinformation embedded in the Ray Tomlinson storyline.He did not, for example, invent anything like email as we all know it and useit. Instead, he simply edited a pre-existing computer program so a user couldappend text to a file on another computer. He introduced the @ sign as a way todistinguish one computer from another. But, the @ sign is not email, no matterhow many millions of dollars Raytheon may spend in their public relations andmarketing efforts to make it so.Instead, the email system now used around the world, with all its many editing,forwarding, and downloading features, was invented by a 14 year old boy namedShiva Ayyadurai, who was interning at the University of Medicine and Dentistryof New Jersey, and wrote 50,000 lines of code in response to a challenge tocreate an electronic equivalent of the paper-based interoffice memo system. Thisincluded features such as Inbox, Outbox, Folders, Attachments, Memo (“To:,”“From:,” “Subject:,” “Date:,” “Cc:,” “Bcc:”), Address Book, etc. – the nowfamiliar components of every email system.But these facts were and still are absolutely anathema to the currently dominanthistorians of high tech innovation. The facts have to be suppressed, and if theycan’t be suppressed they have to be discredited and ridiculed. The truth is justtotally unacceptable.Why is it unacceptable? Because it questions and subverts the dearly held,profit-based myth of how innovation takes place, where it happens, and (mostimportantly) what kind of people are responsible for it. An immigrant,low-caste, high school kid from India, working in Newark, New Jersey (one of thepoorest cities in the United States) is just too outside the centralizedparadigm – especially when, as the years passed, he refuses to “know his place”and keeps telling the truth about what happened.There are several ironies in this situation. First, maintaining a centralizedorganizational model is costly to business, government, and academia. There’s asteep price for ignoring everyone outside the consecrated inner sanctum.Conversely, there can be big rewards for looking elsewhere. But to the rulingoverlords, control is more important than opportunity. Those in power want tomaintain power over the system. They willingly shoot themselves in the foot aslong as they can maintain Controller status.However, if we want to build organizations that are in resonance with nature –biomimetic organizations – then we need to accurately observe how biologicalsystems respond to and process information. If you burn your finger with amatch, your brain doesn’t ignore the sensation and treat it as irrelevant.Intelligence at the periphery – in your finger – directs your body to takeaction immediately to address the injury at its site, without needing centralcommand and control from the brain. At the cellular level, the cell membrane, at the periphery of the cell, is wherethe cell interacts with the external world including viruses, drugs, foods, andother molecules. Those interactions at the cell membrane drive internal cellularreactions within the cytoplasm, directing the cell to turn genes on and off inthe nucleus. This contradicts the concept of DNA as the central command andcontrol authority issuing unilateral commands, as Watson and Crick proposed.In addition to its importance in cellular biology, this also has implicationsfor organizational behavior.In many companies, when an “injury” to the organization occurs at the“periphery” – otherwise known as the customer call center, which in effect isthe “service membrane” – those in central command and control set irrationalobjectives based on maximizing profit by reducing costs. If customers call acompany’s 800 number, most companies focus on “resolving the issue” fast bydoing anything possible to end the call in 90 seconds or less.A widely reported brake pedal incident with Toyota is an example of this.Despite many emails and customers’ phone calls, the issue was ignored. Theproblem finally received widespread attention when people were dying in majoraccidents. Toyota paid the US government 1.2 billion dollars to avoid criminalcharges, and also lost billions in share value overnight.However, there are biomimetic organizations that exploit how nature trulybehaves and responds. Some time ago I worked with the Nike Corporation, whichwas using EchoMail, another of my inventions. EchoMail employed sophisticated AIto read, analyze, respond to, and route email from customers. I realized thatNike was a rare organization that treated customer service calls as a feedbackresource instead of an annoyance to be ended as quickly as possible. Nike sawtheir customer service personnel, their service membrane, as front line directaccess to their customers, even though customer service personnel were far fromthe central command and control center of the CEOs office.Nike made use of information from the periphery, which was viewed as a source ofinnovation. EchoMail was used to intelligently route emails and calls.Complaints about certain shoes, for example, were Transported to productengineering, which used that feedback to Convert advances in shoe design. TheStructure of Nike enabled innovation.Successful companies leverage bio-mimesis and make the principles of SystemsTheory – Goal, Input, Transport, Conversion, Structure, Output, Disturbances,Sensors, Controller – the basis of the organization. The objective is not justcorporate profit, but social profit and service to a broader set of stakeholdersincluding employees, customers, local community and society. These companieshave Sensors to observe the Output of their responses. They use that informationto adjust their system’s Transport, Conversion and Structure elements in orderto achieve larger Goals.Transport originates in an organization’s creative thinkers. Their job is to beimaginative and uninhibited. Then a variety of individuals – includingengineers, sales staff, and executive decision-makers – perform the Conversionof those creative ideas into tangible value. All this takes place within theStructure of the organization provided and maintained by accountants, attorneys,and administrators.In all areas of life, and very noticeably in business, a phase transition is nowtaking place in which the energy of Transport is located in the periphery, atthe service membrane, rather than at the center of an organization. This isapparent, for example, in the Indian dairy cooperative Amul, which is jointlyowned by more than 3.5 million associates. Amul changed India from amilk-deficient nation into one of the world’s largest milk producers, atransformation known as the White Revolution. This is one of the mostastonishing developments in recent business history, more impressive in manyrespects than the rise of Microsoft or Apple.Yet Amul is mostly unknown in the Western world, and the reason for that is verysimple. It’s because Amul is not happening in the Western world. It transcendsthe conventional command and control model of most organizations. Amul is anexample of how those in the periphery, at the “membrane,” the edges, haveself-organized to create a system that is “profitable” to all its stakeholdersin the true meaning of the word. This self-organization defies the centralized,reductionist business model.That outdated and exploitative system has to change, and it will change. TheInternet has erased traditional borders between nations. The population of theWestern world is aging and declining, while rapid change of all kinds –demographic growth, technical innovation, political influence – is taking placein Asia, South America, and Africa. This is the murmuring of the peripheryasserting itself on a multi-national scale in the same way that the cellmembrane is the genuine location of the incredible energy of Transport in everymicroscopic human cell.I’m proud to be taking part in this transition. As an immigrant to the US fromIndia, I am part of the macro demographic shift that is now taking place and onethat will accelerate in the coming years.On a smaller scale – even a microscopic one – my company called CytoSolveaddresses the fact that the siloed and dysfunctional model of thetrillion-dollar pharmaceuticals industry reliant on a feudal academic researchframework is broken and archaic. CytoSolve provides a revolutionary paradigm for drug development, using aninformation-centric, systems-based “in silico” approach, that enables thescalable and dynamic integration of molecular pathway models, by enablingcollaborative research. CytoSolve is in the “cloud” and integrates and couplesscientific research to create a “collaboratory.”Like Amul, CytoSolve’s approach is revolutionary. It provides millions ofbiological researchers – whether in large organizations, or small institutions,or working independently – with a means to collaboratively engage problems inmedicine that simply cannot be solved in the current insular and centralizedacademic model. CytoSolve itself follows bio-mimetic principles by celebratingthe periphery. On a practical note, it provides a feedback system process thatwill completely eliminate the need for animal testing in drug development. The email I invented in 1978 was the electronic emulation of the mailcommunications system. Similarly, CytoSolve is the electronic version of themolecular communication system, and its impact on medicine will likely have thesame impact as email did on communication."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVENAFTER THE REVOLUTIONAs I mentioned, even Marx, who described history’s economic cycles in suchminute detail, refrained from description of the world after “the withering awayof the state.”But now, fully armed with facts, let’s venture where Marx feared to tread, Ihave a clear vision of some key changes that this great phase transition willbring.In the Introduction to this book, I referred to Truth, Freedom, and Health ashumanity’s basic and legitimate goals. In my opinion, this is likely the Goalof a large majority of humankind. This is not to say that other goals do notexist – including Profit, Control, and Vanity for those currently in power. Butwhen our aspirations toward Truth, Freedom and Health are finally achieved, hereare some of the changes I’m sure that we’ll see.  Truth: Knowledge will no longer be seen as belonging only to tenuredacademics with advanced degrees bestowed upon them by institutions funded bygovernment and corporate bureaucracies. Just like the rest of the world,intellectual life will be dynamic, challenging, and open to constantre-evaluation and revision. Truth will not be defined according to the currentthree-stage system of pronouncement by priesthood “authority,” coverage bymedia, and eternal fossilization on Wikipedia.  Freedom: Society will recognize that the spark of phase transition canand does begin anywhere. Anyone can strike the match. Innovation won’t be toutedas an offshoot of the military-industrial-academic complex, nor will innovatorsbe denied recognition based on country of origin, race, religion, gender, orsexual orientation. Innovation will not be a scarcity controlled and anointedby a few. The enormous waste of human talent caused by prejudice and greed willbe over. Everyone will participate, and everyone will benefit. Everyone willalso have the right to bear arms as a practical matter of self-defense, and alsoas a statement that power will not be centralized in government forces.  Health: Care and understanding of the human body will no longer be tiedto the protocols and profit motives of drug makers and large hospitals. Medicaltreatment will not be based on a warfare model of crisis management andmetaphors of victory or defeat. People will be informed and inspired to activelyparticipate in healthcare decisions. One-size-fits-all treatments will berecognized as hopelessly out of date, and as science advances a trulyindividualized practice of medicine will emerge. Overall, the future will be marked by decentralization of Input and Output –that is, decentralization of both resources and results. Education, healthcare,and government will move in the direction of a bio-mimetic paradigm and awayfrom a corporate or bureaucratic model. This will be a movement toward theperiphery, where the majority of humankind exists. While we all rejoice in the Internet and its incredible opportunities, wemust realize that it is still centralized. A few major telecommunicationcompanies, search engine providers, and high-tech companies still control theactual networks, and the dissemination and organization of information. Thiscentralization of power in what ought to be a decentralized paradigm contradictsour freedom of opportunity online. Remember the Egyptian revolution during the Arab Spring? At the height ofthe movement, when workers were willing to take to the streets and join thestudents, the dictator Hosni Mubarak simply made a single phone call toVodafone, one of the biggest telecommunication conglomerates. Vodafone shutdownthe entire network in minutes: no more tweets, posts, or texting. Real freedom will come when we as citizens take control of networks, andwhen we own them individually and collectively. The technology for such citizennetworks is already here. You and I and our communities can create our own meshnetworks, using hardware that we can locate on our roofs and in our homes. Whenthis takes place, we will all become nodes of a network on the periphery, freeof centralized control. This collective can emerge without the need for anycenter. This will be a true bio-mimetic model, resonating organically from theauthentic nature of the electronic medium. And once again, the technology forthis is available now. Further innovation will always be welcome, but is notnecessary here.Nature employs Transport, Conversion, and Structure to achieve tangible goalsthat emerge from self-organization of complex system interactions. Thoseprinciples can also benefit less tangible issues such as happiness in emotionalrelationships, or career satisfaction, or your ability to influence the world inwhich you live.We’ve spoken about the fact that every system needs an objective. We’ve alsoseen how Karl Marx, the great advocate of revolutionary change, did not providea description of what the world would look once the ultimate revolution had beenaccomplished.But the absence of that description did not mean that the revolution should nottake place. In fact, optimism that the goal will be reached – whatever it mayturn out to look like – has got to be present in order for change to happen.There have been disappointments in the past, there have been mistakes, therehave even been catastrophes – but this is what happens in a feedback system.Learning needs to take place, course corrections need to happen, and next timecan be different.There is a story of a student in search of enlightenment who traveled hundredsof miles to consult a renowned Buddhist monk. The student crosses rivers andtraverses sandy deserts. Finally he climbs a steep mountain and finds a smallhut at the summit. Entering the hut, he sees the monk meditating in a lotusposition on the floor. But then the monk looks up expectantly, as if he had beenwaiting for the student to arrive.The student then tells the monk why he has come. He has attempted manyoccupations over the years and nothing has worked out. His relationships havealso been unsuccessful. He has very little money. His life has been extremelydifficult.“I’ve failed at everything,” he tells the monk, hopelessly. The monk considersfor a moment. Then he says, “That was then. This is now.”Every great religion has a story like this, and so do the revolutionarytraditions of East and West. In that context, the purpose of this book has beento present revolution not as a single explosive event, but as a self-correctingsystem moving toward an objective.In the near term, that objective can be to understand your body and your healthfrom a systems perspective and to take positive action.In the longer view, you can apply that same perspective to create genuinerevolution in all areas of life.You can and you should. You have nothing to lose but your chains."}]
