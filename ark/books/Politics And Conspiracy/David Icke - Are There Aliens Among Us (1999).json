[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"7/30/99 RICK MARTINDavid Icke has become a highly sought-after lecturer, worldwide, and it is no wonder.His books in recent years have covered the full range of topics concerning the so-called“elite” global controllers and their stranglehold on the masses.His most recent book, titled The Biggest Secret, is his most daring work to date. To saythat it takes on even more than its title suggests, is still quite an understatement.On July 8, 1999, I caught up with David, by telephone, in London. While he wasrecovering from a prolonged bout with a flu bug, and we would have been thankful withjust a short interview under the circumstances, I think you will agree with me that he was infine form during this conversation.David hits hard on a wide range of topics, some of which will, surely, stretch yourbeliefs and expand your thinking. This is, literally, a “fasten your seatbelts and hold on toyour hat” kind of conversation which captures David’s riveting speaking style as best thatcan be done in print.If you do not read this interview with an open mind, you will probably just dismiss theentire thing. But as a careful reading of The Biggest Lie will reveal, David has definitelydone his homework—as usual!As David told me, he has just done a month in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, andAmerica. He is now, as I write, in South Africa for a month, then back to America inSeptember. He is confirmed in Seattle, Washington to speak at Washington State CTC from10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on September 25; tickets for that event are available throughTicketmaster (206) 628-0888. His schedule for other events may be accessed through hiswebsite which is: <davidicke.com>. His very controversial video tape with Illuminati mind-control victim Arizona Wilder, is available from Bookworld and elsewhere, but for yourconvenience The SPECTRUM is also carrying this video Revelations of a Mother Goddessand his newest book The Biggest Secret; see back page for ordering information. If youwould like to contact David for a speaking engagement or conference, he may be reachedby calling Royal Adams at 602-657-6992 or fax at 602-657-6994. British or Europeaninquiries may be made at Bridge of Love on 01983 566002.With all of that said, sit back and read the latest insights from a researcher who hasAre Their Aliens Among Us?The Biggest SecretAn Interview With David IckeFrom The SPECTRUM newspaper’s Front Page story, August 3, 1999, Vol 1Number 3.

It is very appropriate that two ofDavid’s other books include: And The Truth Shall Set You Free and The Robot’s Rebellion.We are in a time when personal responsibility is the challenge affecting us all—bigtime! What if each of us simply made a resolution to follow the three suggestions Davidmakes near the end of his conversation? Sometimes the simplest ideas to put into words arethe hardest to truly carry out.* * *Martin: I’m talking to you at the seat of global power today, namely London. Notonly are you located at the seat of power, but there are many horrific and nasty thingstaking place behind the seemingly respectable old stone walls of those various places.Icke: Right, absolutely.Martin: As our readers are very well versed on the Global Controllers generally, let’scut to the chase with the bad news first and go from there. What is The Biggest Secret, asyour new book is so appropriately titled?Icke: The biggest secret that’s emerging is that back in the ancient world, we candebate when, but certainly you can pick it up around 5,000 B.C., a series of bloodlinesemerged, particularly but not exclusively—particularly, really, the focus of power was inthe Near and Middle East.These bloodlines became the leaders and the Royal lines of that ancient Near and MiddleEastern area. This bloodline would appear to go back to an extra-terrestrial interventionwhich created hybrid bloodlines. This, I think, is referred to in the Old Testament which is,of course, just an edited rewrite of more ancient texts where it talks about the “sons ofGod” who interbred with the “daughters of men”, creating the hybrid line, the Nefilim/Nephilim. When you go back to the Hebrew, the “sons of God” become the “sons of thegods”. And so often when you see the translation into the English, the King James versionof the Bible, as God in the Old Testament, it actually is translated from the word meaninggods.And these bloodlines moved over as time went on and became the British and EuropeanAristocracy and Royal Families. The incessant interbreeding between these family lines isnot due to snobbery, but their desire to hold a specific genetic structure.Thanks to—well, let’s go back a little. The focus in the ancient world of thesebloodlines appears to be in Babylon, and eventually they moved their epicenter to Rome.And it was when they were in Rome, epicentering in Rome, that we had the Great RomanEmpire.This was a key point in the historical expansion of the power of these bloodlines acrossthe planet. Eventually, one of their number, called William of Orange, to whom everysurviving Royal Family in Europe is related, was manipulated onto the throne of England in1689, and he was the one who signed the Charter that created the Bank of England in 1694.At that point, this group—call it the Illuminati, for want of a better word—thesebloodlines, in other words, moved their epicenter at an operational level, because it hasother levels all around the world, but at an operational level, the spider in the center of thepyramid became London. And then, of course, as years unfolded, came this key time in theexpansion of these bloodlines, the Great British Empire, and as a result of that they wereable to move into the Americas, Australia, Africa, and New Zealand. They show up as faras China.It was said that the Sun never set on the British Empire. Well, when you see the size of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Britain, compared with the world—when I was a kid it was a great mystery to me how thesesmall islands you can hardly see on the globe actually had an empire that spanned theworld. But now I do understand that it was not the British Empire at all, it was the empireof these bloodlines, that had centered themselves in Britain, which is a very different thing.Now, what happened, it’s increasingly becoming clear, is that these bloodlines then tookthe positions of power in these countries of the British Empire. But, there are two forms ofpower. There’s overt power, dictatorship—you can see it, feel it, touch it and taste—andthey always have a finite life because eventually, when people know they’re in adictatorship, in a prison, they’ll rebel against it. The most effective form of control, andthis is what happened when the so-called European Empires, like the British Empire, startedto roll-back, particularly in this century, they replaced overt in-your-face control withcovert control.And that is the ultimate control, because people do not rebel against not being free whenthey think they are. And so, what happened as these empires, as the British Empire, rolled-back on the surface, and of course, “Oh, the great British Empire is over, poor old Britainhas lost her power”, they actually left out in those countries the bloodlines and the secretsociety networks through which they work and they’ve gone on running those countries,including not least, in fact, most and emphatically, the United States, ever since it wasformed.And when you look at the genealogy of American Presidents, it is utterly astonishing insupport of this. There are about 260 million Americans, at the moment. And if you add upall those who have called themselves American since 1776, it will run into hundreds andhundreds of millions. Well, 42 of those hundreds of millions have actually becomePresident of the United States. You would think, on the law of averages alone, that those42 would have some tremendous genetic diversity. Well, they don’t.According to Burke’s Peerage, the bible of Aristocratic and Royal genealogy based inLondon, every American election since and including George Washington, in 1789, hasbeen won by the candidate with the most European Royal genes. 33 of the 42 aregenetically related to two people: Charlemagne (King), the most famous monarch of whatwe call France, and Alfred the Great, the King of England. They’re the two countries,overwhelmingly, France and Britain, out of which these bloodlines came in Europe.Now, since The Biggest Secret came out, and I told the story in there of how thesebloodlines came out of the Near and Middle East, how the blueprint of control by religionwas formed in Babylon, where their Trinity of Nimrod, Tammuz the Sun, and QueenSemiramis the female, there was mirror in terms of the stories of the later Jesus stories, andmany other stories in other cultures that relate to exactly the same stories using differentheros, since I wrote in the book that the Gospels were actually written by a RomanAristocratic family called the Pisos, Piso. Since I wrote in the book that these stories wereeventually taken and turned into a religion by, most notably, the Roman Empire, EmperorConstantine the Great, at the Council of Nicaea in 325 A.D., and, of course, what came outof that, eventually, was the Roman Church which became the Christian religion.Since I wrote in the book that one of the key bloodlines that I am identifying is theMerovingian bloodline that came out of the Near and Middle East into France, and, ofcourse, has been widely written about in various books in the recent ten years or so, since Inoted that in the book that the British Royal Family, including King George III, were thesebloodlines, since all of that, I have, in the last ten days come across the genealogy of theGeorge Bush family, including, of course, George W. Bush, who, surprise, surprise, is beingpushed as the year-2000 President. It only turns out that the Bush family and the Rooseveltfamily, who are of the same line, are genetically related to Alexander the Great, who, I"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"think it’s around 300 B.C., plundered this very area—I’m talking about Egypt, what we callnow Israel, down to Babylon and across to India—this whole area I’m talking about, theBush family and the Roosevelt family are related to him, genetically. They are related tothe Piso family, the Roman aristocratic family who wrote the Gospel stories originally.They’re genetically related to Constantine the Great, the Roman Emperor who took thosestories and turned it into the Christian religion, in effect, which makes the people whowrote the stories and the person who created the religion, the same bloodline.They’re genetically related to Dagobert, one of the key Merovingian line. Dagobert wassaid to be one of the last surviving Merovingian line, but that’s not correct. The Bushfamily is also genetically related to George III, who was around when people like BenjaminFranklin were giving the American people the impression they were going to freedom, whenactually they were going to covert control by Britain, which they’ve had ever since.So when you look—and this is just a few headlines from the Bush line—when you lookat the Bush line alone it supports, emphatically, these bloodlines that came out of thatancient Near and Middle Eastern area and have been brought through to be in positions ofpower, not least today. It is no accident, Rick, that George W. Bush, with that background,genetically, is the one they’re bringing through and throwing the money at to becomepresident in the year 2000, which is a key year for them.So, in effect, what I’m saying is that my research is very strongly pointing to the factthat the extraterrestrials are not coming, they’re not going to invade, they’ve actually beencontrolling this planet, increasingly, for thousands of years. And when I sayextraterrestrials, I don’t mean all extraterrestrials, I mean I’m talking about this particulargroup. And it seems to me that the situation is this, that—oh, the House of Windsor, by theway, are one of these bloodlines, big-time, and they know it—they’re related to the Bushs,not surprisingly. Anyway, it seems that one of the key reasons that they are trying to holdthis genetic structure is that this planet is actually controlled not from the physical level,which is just one level of it, but actually from what people call the lower astral, or I callthe lower fourth dimension. It is the lower cess-pit end of the dimension closest to thisone. And, it seems that, talking to people who have worked on the inside with these peopleand taken part in their rituals—indeed, in one case, conducted them—these lower fourth-dimensional entities who, of course, the satanic rituals interact with—the legendary realm ofthe folklore demons and all this stuff—that somehow, these particular genetic lines, in theirmost pure form, have a much greater vibrational reasonance and vibrational sympathy withthe lower fourth dimension, and therefore, can be much more easily—what we would call—possessed and taken over by these lower fourth-dimensional entities, which kind of meansthat if you can put these particular bloodlines, the physical body, if you like, in a positionof power, you’re actually putting these lower fourth-dimensional entities into positions ofpower, because they’re working through these particular lines.And, again and again, when you get into the genealogy, my goodness me, that takessome time and sweat, you hit the same genetic lines when you’re looking at people inpositions of power. It seems to me that these lower fourth-dimensional entities haveactually been working through what we call the Illuminati to actually control the planet.And, while all this was unfolding, I started getting some very bizarre stories told to me.Martin: I bet.Icke: And the thing about my life, Rick, in the last 10 years or so, consciously walkingthis journey—I now realize that I was unconsciously doing it all of my life—is thatsuddenly a subject heading will come into my life, and once it’s appeared, I’m meetingpeople literally from all over the world, because I’ve been in 21 countries in the last twoyears now, and been back to quite a few of them, so I can start to see, as a result of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"traveling, these common themes that are coming up all over the world.And one theme that came up last year, May ’98, it had been around a little bit but I putit on the back burner. There wasn’t enough evidence to talk about it, really. And that wasthat people had seen people in positions of power, not exclusively so, butoverwhelmingly so, turn into a reptilian form and then go back to human. And, in aperiod of 15 days, in May 1998, I met 12 separate people in different parts of America fromdifferent walks of life and different backgrounds, in my travels, who told me the samestory. I thought, “What in the hell is going on here?!”When I came back to England, the sequence continued. I was asked by a couple ofpeople, who were members of the House of Lords, in London, to go and talk to them at theHouse of Lords about the manipulation, which they also realized was going on. And Ichatted with them for a while, and there was a lady at the meeting who kept saying somevery interesting things about Diana, you know, the Princess of Wales. And, after themeeting, I said, “Look, hey, we gotta talk.”She said, “We have.” And we went off and chatted.I said, “Where did you get this information about Diana?”She said, “My best friend was her closest confidant on things she couldn’t talk about toanyone else for nine years.” Now, this lady has actually appeared in the press from time-to-time as being a close friend of Diana. Anyway, she said, “I think this lady might talk toyou. She’s never talked to anyone else.”So, I went to see her and her name was Christine Fitzgerald. She starts telling me aboutthe connection, all of the treatment of Diana by the Windsors, which was utterly, utterlyoutrageous. I haven’t talked to this lady Christine Fitzgerald about these bizarre stories I’mbeing told by people around the world. Then, as the conversation unfolded, she said, “Oh,do you know what Diana’s nickname for the Windsors was?”I said, “No, go on.”She said, “The lizards or the reptiles.” And she said, “She used to say, in allseriousness, ‘They are NOT human!’ ” Christine Fitzgerald went on to tell me: “You know,the Windsors are a reptilian line, they’re not human.” And that “the British Royal Family,and its inter-linking bloodlines, are actually reptilian, they come from a reptilianextraterrestrial race.”And I’m thinking, “Bloody hell, not another one!”And I came back here—about an hour and a half from London—my home is in England.I knew of a guy called Ted Heath, who was Prime Minister of Britain from ’70-’74, and Iknew that he was involved in some serious horrendous things, like sacrificing children, andall this stuff, because of people who had seen it. And, a lady I knew, who had contactedme, wanted to tell me about her experiences with Ted Heath, so I went to see her, not totalk about shape-shifting reptilians, but to talk about Ted Heath and satanic ritual involvingthe elite of Britain.And, again, but just as a quick incidental—when you follow these bloodlines from theancient world to the present day, this satanic ritual, human sacrifice and blood ritual, evenusing the same deities in the rituals, is a common and constant, unchanging theme. So, itwould be very surprising if the elite today weren’t into this, because these bloodlinesalways have been, just like Bush is into it and people like that. Anyway, I went to see thislady and she told me about her experiences with Heath and stuff.In a place called Burnham Beeches, which is an area of forested land notorious forsatanic ritual, among people who have studied these things, it just so happens that, althoughBurnham Beeches is on the outskirts of London, not far from Heathrow Airport, the place isactually owned by the City of London, the financial district which is the epicenter of this"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"control. I just finished me cup o’ tea—you know how you do in her house—and I was justmaking my way to leave, after she told me this stuff, and I said to her, just to throw away aline as I left, I said, “You know, I’m having some bizare things happening to me at themoment.” I said, “I keep meeting people who tell me that they’ve seen people shape-shiftinto bloody reptiles.” And, honestly, she grabbed her chest and she was gasping for breathlike she was having a seizure.“Oh, my God,” she said, “I thought it was only me.” And she went on to tell me thatshe wasn’t going to say that to me because she thought that even I would find thatunbelievable. She said, “All that stuff I’ve told you about Heath and seeing him in thesatanic rituals and all that stuff,” she said, “I wasn’t going to tell you what I also saw. Heshape-shifted into a reptilian, during the ritual. What staggered me,” she said, “is that noneof the other participants were at all phased by it, as if it was a natural thing that alwayskind of happened.”This has gone on, Rick, to the present day. I was in Vancouver, speaking, and I metabout 4 or 5 people who told me the same story, including a business woman, who is a realfeet-on-the-ground, you know, power-dressing kind of 5,000 clients business woman. Andshe said she had this relationship with a guy who was Portuguese, and he just turned intoa reptile in front of her.I had just spoken at a financial conference about the manipulation of the world in theBahamas, and two people there told me the same story. One told me how she was in areligious cult, and on one occasion, the cult leader changed into a reptile in front of herface. And she said, what was most amazing is that he focused on her, and the otherscouldn’t see it, but she could, and she said she just went out of the room and started drivingand never stopped, really.You know, this is now hundreds and hundreds of people who I’ve met from around theworld, from many walks of life—a couple of television presenters who interviewed this guylive and, when they went back in the green room one said, “I had a very strange experienceduring that interview. The guy’s face turned into a bloody reptile.”“Oh, my God,” said the other, “I saw his hands turn into a reptilian.”And so this is—then you look, of course, at the ancient world, and you start to seeconstant references to serpents and the serpent race. Not that all references are literal—Imean, there’s the serpent symbolism that’s used massively—but when you get, like, theNagas, the gods of the ancient Hindu religion, who were said to be able to take human ORreptilian form, and then, while this is going on, Rick, I thought, “I’m sure Cathy O’Brienmentioned bloody reptiles in [her candid and shocking book, with Mark Phillips, called]Trance-formation Of America.”Martin: Yes.Icke: I got a copy of that, started flipping through the index, looking for reptiles,thinking, “My life is getting more bizarre by the minute.”Martin: (Laughter)Icke: And, I’m going through the references in the book and, of course, Cathy talks inthe book about being with George Bush and that George Bush—and she obviously took thisto be part of the mind control, she took it to be a holographic image, it was part of themind control—but when you put this other evidence together, well, hold on a minute.She talks about being with George Bush, and him saying that they were anextraterrestrial race that came from a “far off space place” who’d taken over the world, andno one realized it because they look human. But, she said, he changed in front of her into areptile. She talked about being with the Bennett brothers, these politicians, political figuresin America, and how they put her through a mind-control program in which they said they"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"came from another dimension and they were inter-dimensional beings.And she had an experience during that time of seeing a White House cocktail partywhere everyone turned into bloody reptiles. And then she talks in the book about beingwith Miguel De La Madrid, in Mexico, who was, of course, President during the Bushyears, and how he told her, she said in the book, the story of the Iguana race. And, MiguelDe La Madrid said that an extraterrestrial reptilian race had interbred with the ancientMexican people because they needed to create bloodlines or bodies they could workthrough, and these particular bloodlines could take either human or reptilian form. She saysin the book that he actually shape-shifted, not totally, but facially, into a reptilian formwhen she was with him.Now, when you start putting all of this together, Rick—I have a simple philosophy—Ifollow information, and I’ll go where it takes me. If you come from, anyone comes from,any belief or background, whether it be religious, political, or whatever, and they are rigidwith it, then they’re never going to uncover what’s going on because that belief, that rigidbelief, will start to edit information when it comes toward you, and you start editing-outinformation that’s taking you away and challenging your original belief-system.I haven’t got any of that stuff, fortunately, and so I just follow information, and it’staken me into these areas. Interestingly, too—and I’m just going back there, so I’m goingto do some more on this—when I was in South Africa, about February last year, I met aZulu shaman, a famous Zulu shaman in South Africa. I met with him for about five hoursabout various things.He knew about the elite and the manipulation and the extraterrestrial connection, and allthis stuff. He’s in his 70s now, I mean, he’s lived a long time in Africa, and is a very greatexpert on African legend and stories and experience. And he told me, during this chat, thathe got a call in March of 1997—this is before the August when Diana died—and this callersaid that she was the Princess of Wales and wanted to talk to him. Now, he didn’t believethis, at first, and he certainly didn’t believe it when she said to him that she was calling himfrom what, he termed, a supermarket phone. “Princesses don’t call from supermarketphones,” he thought.Well, when I talked to Christine Fitzgerald about two months later, her confidant, shesaid, “That makes absolute sense, because Diana knew that her phones at Kensington Palacewere tapped, and when she wanted a clean line, she used to go into a local departmentstore,” to what this shaman would have been a supermarket, “to use the public phone to geta clean line.”This shaman told me—and he later realized they had a connection, one of his studentswas a relative of Diana—and, interestingly, this shaman talks a lot about extraterrestrialconnections with humanity and his own extraterrestrial experiences, of which he has hadsome astonishing ones. Anyway, she said to him that she wanted to talk to him because shehad something to reveal about the Windsors that would shake the world and she wantedadvice in how best to do it. And, talking to a lady who I met after Christine Fitzgerald, alady called Arizona Wilder, who claims to have conducted rituals for the British RoyalFamily, that Diana knew that they were actually shape-shifting reptilians who shape-shiftedduring the rituals and, I said to this shaman, “What was it she wanted to reveal about theWindsors?” And he said, “I can’t tell you, it’s just too terrible. I don’t want to get intoany more trouble.”So, I said I knew that Diana knew that the Windsors were involved in the global drug-running operation and she knew that they were involved in that. And he just shook hishead. He said, “Oh, no.” He said, “It was much worse than that.” And I’m going backthere soon, so I’m going to have another go at finding exactly what it was."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"But this Arizona Wilder lady, again, came on the scene after Christine Fitzgerald. Ifound her in Los Angeles, or near Los Angeles, and I went to see her, not to talk aboutshape-shifting reptilians, yet again, because I wasn’t talking about it at the time; I was justgathering information. I went to talk to her about the rituals she said she conducted for theBritish Royal Family, and the Bushs, the Kissingers, and people like that in America.Because Arizona Wilder, even though she’s got red hair today, is actually blond haired,with piercing blue eyes. And the blond-haired, blue-eyed thing is fundamentally involvedin all of this stuff, and what have you. Anyway, that is why Project Monarch isoverwhelmingly, if not exclusively, blond-haired, blue-eyed people.I went to talk to her about the rituals that she says she conducted. So, we’re getting intothis stuff, and she’s telling me about the rituals at Balmoral in which, you know, humansacrifice takes place in Scottland, the Queen’s Palace in Scotland, and also at Glames Castleand the Castle of Darkness, as it’s called, in Belgium, which Fritz Springmeier and CiscoWheeler talk about in their book. And I had heard all of this from other sources, I mean,Christine Fitzgerald was talking about the stuff they got up to, but then, as the conversationunfolded, Arizona said to me: “But that’s not the most bizarre thing that happened.”And I thought, “Well, how much more bizarre can you get, the Queen of Englandsacrificing children?” And, she said, when the blood started to flow, they shape-shifted intoreptiles. And, in their reptilian form, they’re very, very different—I mean, like, the QueenMother, this sounds funny, really—but the Queen Mother is an old frail 99-year-old, butthat’s the physical form in three-dimensional reality. But it’s not the physical form of thereptilian that’s working through her, according to these people.And I got a call from a lady in America who is the head of Parents Against RitualAbuse. And I was talking to her, again, not about shape-shifting reptilians, but about theritual abuse of children in America, and she said during this conversation, “Do you know,about 12 of my clients have actually reported that, during the rituals, they’ve seen theparticipants turn into reptiles.” And, she said, “I’ve always taken it to be that they’redressing up to confuse them.”But when you take all of this together, Rick, all this emerging information, and sinceI’ve gone public on it, obviously, in the book, you start to attract people who know theycan talk to you, because, you know, the thing that keeps this quiet most of the time is thatpeople who know things and have seen things think, “Well, who’s going to believe me?”And, interestingly—and this is a true story also, and it kind of sums up the way this hasbeen unfolding—when The Biggest Secret was at the printers in January, I got a call inAmerica from a guy, he was just a guy who read my other books, and he said, “Hey, yougot a new book coming out?”I said, “Yeah, it’s at the printers now.”He said, “What’s it about?”I said, “Well, you’ll have to read it because some of it is so bizarre, if I told you aboutit, well, you’d think this is crazy.”So anyway, we go on chatting about what you do and where you’ve been and all thisstuff. So then, after about ten or fifteen minutes into this conversation, he says, “Hey,you’re going to think I’m mad,” he said, “but have you ever come across anyone who hasseen people in positions of power, like Bush, Gorbachev, Kissinger, turn into reptiles?”I thought, “Shit, not another!”I said, “Well, why do you ask the question?”He said, “Because I keep seeing this.” He said, “When they come on the television, Ikeep seeing them turn into reptiles.”So, the story has gone on—interestingly, too! I can’t remember the exact word now, but"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"I was interviewed on a radio station by the guy who does reverse speech. Have you comeacross that?Martin: Yes, I have.Icke: Well, he wanted to talk to me about some reverse speech they’d taken from a guyKen Bacon—do you remember the guy who was the Pentagon spokesman, or White Housespokesman—Pentagon spokesman, I think, during the Kosovo war, and they had done somereverse speech on him and said, “Do you know what this means? We can’t work it out.”And it was clear as day. He was making a statement about the war to the press, and inreverse it said something like, “We are the people of the snake and we”—something like, Ican’t remember the exact wording now, I’ve got it on tape in America, basically—“we arethe people of the snake and we look after our own” was basically the theme of what hesaid, clear as day, and I nearly dropped off the chair.So, there is something in all of this which holds the key to understanding so much abouthow the world has been controlled, where this world is actually controlled from, and Iwould strongly suggest that what we are looking at with the Kissingers and the Bushs andthe Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and all these people, are actually the three-dimensional, physical expressions of a lower-fourth-dimensional consciousness andmanipulation. And the physical Illuminati are merely the three-dimensional expression ofthe fourth-dimensional control of planet Earth.And, interestingly too, when you go back and back and back, and you follow how theWhite race came out of the Near and Middle East, with these bloodlines within them, andyou pick up one of those White races called the Phoenicians—they actually worshipped aguy called, one of their dieties was called, St. George, in Cappadocia, who they saiddefeated the dragon. And because the Phoenicians actually went around 3,000 B.C. toBritain and took what we now call the British culture—which, indeed, in various forms hasbecome the world culture—St. George in Cappadocia (Cappadocia is in what we now callTurkey) became St. George of Britain.And another diety that the Phoenicians worshipped and took to Britain was St. Michael,who, it was said, of course, threw the serpent into the abyss—or threw the serpent onto theEarth for the final battle and all this stuff. This battling-with-serpents stuff goes on and on.The other thing that I’m connecting in The Biggest Secret—and more and more peopleare beginning to do this—is the connection between the Earth and Mars, because it seems tome that the cataclysms which destroyed so much of the Earth, which the geological record,as well as the ancient legends and accounts talk about, the massive cataclysms, probablyone that destroyed what became known as Atlantis and there were later ones, too, were thesame cause of that cataclysm, some renegade or out-of-control celestial body of some kindactually destroyed Mars. I’m just reading books about compilations of the evidence that’sbeen gathered about Mars, and there is tremendous evidence that Mars was actually a planetwith an atmosphere very much like the Earth’s, in the very near past, certainly the last20,000 years, even 10,000 years, possibly. And, I think there was a tremendous connectionbetween a civilization on Mars and the Earth, and when this cataclysm destroyed Mars, thesurviving “Martian” people, who could—well, I suggest, be what we call the White racetoday, genetically—actually came and settled here and re-emerged, eventually, as theSumerian culture, the Egyptian culture, and those great civilizations of the ancient world.Interestingly, the connections between their symbolism, their dieties, their legends, and theplanet Mars are absolutely extraordinary. So, there is something big-time to look at there.And what Arizona Wilder has said, in that in her preparation and training to conduct therituals, because she was obviously a Cathy O’Brien-type, multiple-personality-created-robotto do these rituals, she said, what she was told by the insiders during her training was that"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"the White race and this reptilian race have actually been at war with each other for a long,long time, not just on planet Earth. And that somehow the reptilians want more thananything the blond-haired, blue-eyed genetic stream because there’s something in the bloodthat they want. She also suggests—I don’t know if this is true, I’m just quoting her—thatthe desperate need to conduct rituals and drink human blood, particularly blond-haired,blue-eyed blood, is because there’s something in there that they want, is actually part oftheir need to hold this human three-dimensional form, through which they can operate fromthe fourth dimension. And if they don’t get this blood, then they genetically start to fall-apart, in terms of the three-dimensional, apparently, human form.Whether that’s true or whether it’s not true, and obviously I don’t know that, when youlook at totally unconnected sources who talk about the involvement of the elite in theserituals, and stuff like that, they say again and again, that some of the most famous people inAmerican politics, business, banking, and Britain too, like the Royal Family, are actuallyaddicted to blood-drinking, and particularly addicted to an adrenaline that enters the bloodat the point of sacrifice. And it’s like a theme, like I say, which you can follow back withthese bloodlines, right back to the ancient world. And when I talk to therapists around theworld who work with satanically abused people, those who survived, trying to give themtheir minds back, they tell me that the deities their clients tell them are used in these ritualstoday are exactly the same deities that the Babylonians were using and the Cainites wereusing and the Phoenicians were using, right back in the ancient world.So, The Biggest Secret for me, in summary, is that an extraterrestrial race has interbredwith humanity, creating particular hybrid bloodlines which they can work through from thisdimension very close to ours, and that as it expanded over the thousands and hundreds ofyears to the present day, they’ve managed to expand their power out of a power base in theNear and Middle East, other places too but particularly there, until today they are actuallyin control of the planet.And it is the ultimate control because they’re controlling the planet from anotherdimension, but most of humanity doesn’t even think that there are other dimensions. Andthis suppression of knowledge about other dimensions, the suppression of knowledge of thenature of life, the nature of frequencies and vibrations, and the eternal nature ofconsciousness, for reasons that this Illuminati has created religions to suppress—indeed,make so off-limits for many thousands of years just talking about these things—is tosuppress the very knowledge or even perception that there could be any other dimension orany other levels of life, which means that they can go on controlling humanity from levelsof existence that most of humanity doesn’t even accept exist. I mean, you can’t get betterforms of control than that.Martin: Ok. A couple of questions come to mind from what you’ve just said. One,which is not a question that I would particularly ask, but I’m sure other readers might:Have you encountered any credibility issues since you have gotten into the reptilian subject?And then, after you cover that: Obviously there is a Divine Hand overseeing the entireplanetary transition. What would you say to those readers who despair over the apparenthopelessness at the hands of these elite controllers?Icke: Right, well, yeah, that’s a big question. First of all, let’s answer the credibilitything. Let’s make very clear where I’m coming from. First of all, I really do not give ashit what anyone thinks of me and what I do. What I care passionately about is trying touncover what’s going on so that it can be stopped and changed, and I care passionatelyabout everyone having the right to hear all information and not just that which will lead usto a certain limited conclusion. I am completely emotionally detached from how peoplereceive what I do, because if I wasn’t, you’d just go crazy."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"People have a right to believe whatever they want to believe, and that includes the rightto dismiss whatever I say. I don’t have a problem with that. I have a problem with thesuppression of the communication of information. So, how people receive it is completelyup to them, and it’s their absolute right to accept it, accept a bit of it, or just dismiss thelot. That’s up to them. So, I don’t have a problem with that, it’s of no importance to mehow people receive it. It’s important to me that they have the right to have access to it.On the other side of it, however, I would say this: I’ve spoken all around the worldabout this, and The Biggest Secret has now been out for a few months. I mean, you know,we’re now into 30,000 print-runs on this book. I mean, it’s extraordinary, the interest in it.And, what has staggered me is that I’ve actually stood up on public stages all over theworld and talked about this, and the reaction, while it has been one of astonishment to startwith, it actually makes sense to incredible numbers of people when they sit long enough tohear the evidence. Because I’m not standing up there and asserting this is what’s going on,that’s what’s going on. I’m saying this is the information, this is what people areexperiencing, look at the support of it in the ancient world. There is a case to answer here,something is going on.So, the way it has been received has been staggering. What I find disappointing—itdoesn’t really matter to me, but I find disappointing because of it’s effect—is the way thatsome conspiracy researchers, who are always saying that there’s suppressed information andall this stuff, actually want to suppress the information I’m presenting that they don’t likeas well.Martin: Right.Icke: It’s extraordinary. I mean, people talk about freedom, Rick, and yet they don’tunderstand what it is. So often, when I talk to people about freedom and they say, “Yeah,we want freedom.” If you talk to them long enough, you find that they don’t actually wantfreedom. They want the freedom to replace an imposition they don’t like with animposition they do!You know, this is when you get the Christian Patriot Movement, of which I have greatsympathy in the way that they are trying to expose some levels of the conspiracy, but youknow, I don’t see much of a difference between an imposed culture and imposed thoughtthrough the Illuminati being replaced by an imposed thought through “one nation underGod”. Because when you say, “Well, whose God are we talking about here?” Their’s, ofcourse, is the Christian version of God. That’s no more freedom than anything else. So, Ifind it sad that, even though “divide and rule” is actually the foundation of all control bythe few of the many, throughout human history, without it you couldn’t do it, thatconspiracy researchers and people in some of the religions still fall for this scam of divideand rule.So, actually, some of the most fierce abuse that I’ve had since the book came out hasnot been from the public, actually, it’s been from some other conspiracy researchers whocan’t get their head around anything beyond the physical. You know, be my guest. Butsurely whether we agree with each other or not, what a boring world if we did agree witheverything we all said. Surely if we’re going to get to the heart of this, we need to focuson what we’re all agreed on, which is the need to expose that this world is controlled.Now, I might have a certain view, based on the information that I’ve uncovered, of whois controlling it and all that stuff, but let’s say, “Well, I don’t agree with you on that, Ican’t get my head around that, I haven’t done that research anyway, so I don’t know.” Butlet’s agree on what we agree on, and let’s go together, united, behind the desire for freedomin the world. But instead of that, once somebody writes anything or says anything that’sdifferent, to even the conspiracy norm, because that norm has now started to emerge,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"another bloody prison, then other conspiracy researchers start laying-into and abusing eachother. I mean, some of the stuff that goes around on the Internet with conspiracy peopleabusing each other, I mean, I reach for the sick-bag. I mean, the statement that “a fewcan’t control the world” is a piece of cake to knock down.But the third point that you make is a very, very important one because this is a wholearea of research and understanding which I’m now moving deeper and deeper into. We aremulti-dimensional beings. We have part of our consciousness working directly through thephysical form, in three-dimensional embodiment, in three-dimensional awareness, but weexist on all other dimensions. In the end, we are everything. You know, everyone is thesame energy consciousness, we are everything in the end.There’s only an “I”, not even a “we”, when you get to the highest level of all this. But,I’ve actually talked about this in bits and pieces in previous books, but I’m beginning tounderstand this more and more, now.I suggested in And The Truth Shall Set You Free that we could well be living inside avibrational prison, that somehow a vibrational net had been thrown around this thirddimension which made it very, very difficult for three-dimensional embodiedconsciousness—if you like, the consciousness that’s looking through the eyes and hearingthrough the ears—to connect with its multi-dimensional self.And it seems to me that this lower fourth-dimensional level, that this elite-controllersgroup works on, and I want to emphasize this, Rick, very, very strongly—when I talk aboutreptilians, I am not talking about all reptilians. Just as when we talk about the Illuminati,we’re not talking about people in physical form. I’m talking about a particular group. I’msure the reptilian form is a massive constant across great chunks of this galaxy and beyond,and I’m certainly not saying that anyone in reptilian form—any time anyone sees anyone inreptilian form, and there are a lot of people who do—and say, “I didn’t get bad vibes fromthem.” Quite right, because we’re not talking about ALL reptilians, we’re talking a groupthat appears to take a reptilian form because that’s how people keep seeing these people inpower. So, I would emphasize that very strongly because we don’t want to get into this“good guys/bad guys” crap or we lose the plot again. The truth is never black or white; it’salways a shade a gray, it seems to me.What I’m beginning to more and more understand is that this lower fourth-dimensionallevel that this group operates from, this “Illuminati consciousness”—we’ll put it like that—is the frequency range that vibrates to the emotions of fear and the off-shoots of fear, likeguilt, resentment, aggression, all these things. And, therefore, the more that events can becreated on the Earth which generate—my goodness me, they do by the minute—theemotions of fear, guilt, resentment, etc., within the human form, we are actually turned intogenerators of energy for that lower fourth-dimensional frequency range, if you follow me.Because every time we feel emotion, the emotion of fear, our thought-emotional patternsare resonating energy around us and within us to that frequency of fear, which appears torelate very strongly to this lower fourth-dimensional level.Now, where experiments have been done—I think the Institute of HeartMath in Americahas done a lot of this; it’s got an Internet site, it’s very interesting—they’ve doneexperiments measuring the frequency of various emotions, and they’ve shown that thefrequency of fear is very low, slow. And when we’re feeling fear, it is actually reasonatingour energy very slowly. When we feel the emotion of what we call love, in it’s truestsense, that is a very fast frequency which actually reasonates our energy very quickly. It’slike waves going through and resonating the energy, which is just neutral. I mean, thoughtreasonates the energy. Do you want it fast? Do you want it slow? What were youthinking? What were you feeling?"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"So the more—this is vital to understanding this on a higher level, I would suggest—themore that humanity lives it’s life in fear and the off-shoot emotions that come from fear,the slower the vibrational reasonance of consciousness working directly through thephysical form. If the highest expression of ourselves, beyond this lower fourth-dimensional“cess-pit” vibration, as I call it, is operating at a higher wavelength than fear, andultimately at the wavelength of love, what I would suggest is the highest wavelength ofall—just like Radio America cannot sync with Radio Philadelphia because they are ondifferent wavelengths—the wavelength of fear cannot sync with the higher wavelengths oflove and other states of being.So, in essence, as long as humanity can—in physical embodiment, that level of ourconsciousness—be kept and immersed in the emotion of fear, we actually vibrationallydisconnect and can do nothing else, can do nothing other than disconnect from the highestexpressions of who we are. We can’t do anything other than that.So, coming to the question, Rick, and it’s a very important one, “How do we get out ofhere?” and “Where are the good guys?”—I keep hearing, “Where are the people coming tohelp us?”Well, those of an emotional-mental state of being that wish to set—not in embodiment, Imean other-dimensional beings—who are of an intent to set the planet free, they are of alevel of vibrational reasonance, as a result of that state of being, in which they cannotconnect with consciousness that is in a state of fear. It simply cannot happen because thereis a vibrational gap between the two. This is the vital point I would suggest, anyway.It’s not that those of higher-dimensional consciousness who wish to set us free have toconnect with us; it’s that we, in fear, have need to connect with them. And the only way ofdoing that is through breaking out of fear; it’s breaking out of the three-dimensionalillusion, the movie screen, the holographic kind of virtual reality game that we’re looking atwhen we open our eyes, and getting into the wavelength of love, in it’s true sense.Because when we start to vibrate as a result of that state of being, to the energy of love,and our intent is freedom for all, not just ourselves, freedom in its true sense—freedom foryou to say what I don’t agree with, freedom for you to live your life-style in a way that Iwouldn’t live mine—that level of true freedom, that I will stand for your freedom to saysomething that I disagree with as much as I’ll stand for mine to say what I think—when youhit that level, then your state of being starts to vibrate faster and faster, and starts to reachthrough this vibrational prison of low-vibrational emotion, fear overwhelmingly, andreconnect with the higher dimensions of ourselves; we start to become whole again.Then we become lights or beacons that can bring this higher-dimensional knowledge/consciousness/understanding into embodiment and start to become like broadcast transmittersof it, which starts to reasonate and change the energy field that we’re living in, and starts tobreak-up this fear-based energy field that we’ve been living in all this time—and have beenmanipulated to add to every time we think and feel fear.So, again, it’s about responsibility BY ME. It’s not about saying, “Come and saveus!” It’s about saying, “How do we connect with those who can guide us out of thisabyss?”What if this abyss is actually a lower vibrational energy field caused by theoverwhelmingly dominating fear emotion on planet Earth. We have actually feared ourselvesinto a low vibrational state, which has put us into a vibrational prison controlled from thislower fourth dimension, which is expert at manipulating fear because that is the vibration ofit’s being.And if we could just turn that around and start resonating—by our own actions and ourown thoughts and our own state of being—to the emotion of love, which is not “I love you"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"darling because I saw you in the disco.” Love is the ultimate power because it will speak it’struth and walk it’s talk and do what it believes to be right, no matter what the consequencesto itself. That’s the kind of love I’m talking about.Because love has no fear—the emotion that actually takes our power away—so lovewithout fear must be the ultimate power. If we can get into that state, we start to reconnectwith those levels. So we say, “Where are they?” Well, they’re sitting around waiting for usto connect with them, but WE have to make the connection. Otherwise these other higherdimensions, that are seeking to help us and of which we are a part, would have to come intothe wavelength of fear to connect with us—which would actually defeat the object of thewhole thing.Martin: You continually use the term “problem, reaction, solution”. For those readerswho are not aware what that is, would you explain?Icke: It’s the most powerful mass-manipulation technique that has been used overthousands of years to advance this agenda to central, globalized control of all institutions ofour lives. Kosovo, Bosnia, all of these different manipulated wars and problems—theOklahoma City bombing, people going crazy with guns around the world, in schools and stuff,these are classic expressions of this.If you want to introduce something like gun control, I think on gun control we gotmanipulated into the wrong debate. Whether guns are good, or whether guns are bad isactually a debate worth having, but it’s not the crucial debate at this moment because what’shappened by pulling us into this debate of “are guns good or are guns bad?” is that it hasactually diverted people from the debate which we should actually be having in light of theseevents—which is why we have this pattern all over the world.Because I travel a lot, I tell you, it’s happening everywhere, people going crazy with guns,shooting people in the streets or schools, and then immediately legislation being proposed totake guns out of circulation. People should remember that gun laws were introduced inGermany just before Hitler started filling concentration camps.I don’t have guns. I wouldn’t use guns. I’m not into guns. I don’t see the point inmeeting violence with violence because you get twice the violence. But we need to get streetwise. Some people would use guns, and on the face of it, it will be easier to take over anunarmed population than an armed population, on the face of it. That’s not actually true, buton the face of it that appears to be true. And, therefore, what better than taking guns out ofcirculation before you’ve had your final coup, if you like. So, “problem, reaction, solution”overcomes the situation in which, if you introduced what you want to introduce, openly, thenyou know that it would be so unpopular that you would get tremendous resistance to it.For instance, if you wanted to give more power to the police, more power to the military,more power to stop and search, more power to go into your homes without permission, etc.,and you did that openly without any of this other incentive-manipulation, there’d betremendous resistance from people who say, “This is a global, fascist state!” or “This is afascist country! You mustn’t do this; we’re not having it!” So “problem, reaction, solution”overcomes this. It’s a brilliant technique, very simple, and it means that not only do youavoid such opposition, you actually manipulate people who would normally oppose what youwant, to see it as the only solution to the problems that have been created and demand youintroduce it.So, in Stage One, you create a problem. You make sure, however, someone else isblamed for it—a Timothy McVeigh, a Lee Harvey Oswald, President Milosevic, and all thisstuff—you create a problem. You could create a war, as in Bosnia or Kosovo, you couldcreate a “terrorist” bombing, a government collapse, an economic collapse, or whatever, a runon Wall Street, anything."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"You then get your problem, which you’ve covertly created, to be reported through yourmedia in the way you want the people to perceive it. So, you report the Oklahoma Citybombing as if it was due to a couple of guys in a barn somewhere who produced this fuel-fertilizer device which, of course, independent bomb experts have said couldn’t possibly havecaused that damage in the building. You then glean, as a result of this, the demand that“something must be done!” “What are they going to do about it?” “We can’t have this; dosomething!” And so you’ve now had Stage One—create the problem.And you’ve also, at this point, had Stage Two—the public reaction: “Do something!”That allows you to play out the sting operation, called Stage Three, which is offering the“solutions” you wanted to impose in the first place, to the problems you have yourselfcreated.So, if you take the Oklahoma City bombing for instance, within 24 hours of the event atthe James P. Murrah federal building on April 19, 1995, you had Bill Clinton calling for aneasing of restrictions on the military’s involvement in domestic law enforcement. The Anti-Terrorism Bill, that went through Congress on the nod and took away basic freedoms inAmerica, went through purely and totally because of the Oklahoma City bombing and as areaction-solution to that problem.The more deeply you look into these events which are blamed on other people, themore clear it becomes that the people who proposed the legislation, afterwards, are thepeople who created the problem in the first place. And this is going on all the time.We’ve just seen a massive example of this. I’ve been writing in my books, and manyother people have been too, that NATO is designed to become the world police force, in someform, maybe not even called NATO when it reaches that point, but certainly NATO is thevehicle through which the global police force is being orchestrated.In Bosnia, the First Stage of this, you had the UN peacekeeping operation as the statusquo at the start of it. But that was massively exposed, on purpose, in a co-ordinated way asbeing next to useless. At the same time, horrific pictures were pouring through our televisionscreens night after night, of horrors in Bosnia. This, of course, led to calls—as a result ofthis problem “something must be done!” And the solution was a 60,000-strong world army,under NATO control, that took over in Bosnia. And, as I’ve shown in my books and talks,every major peace negotiator appointed by the UN or the European Union to end the war inBosnia—but no, they didn’t, of course—was a member of the Bilderberg Group, the TrilateralCommission, and the Council on Foreign Relations, sometimes all three.Then, as a result of Bosnia, the status quo was changed from reacting to these events witha UN peacekeeping operation, to reacting to them with NATO. So when they play Stage Twoof this game, and that’s all it is, this is not the end of it, Kosovo—there was no talk of UNpeacekeeping operations—straight away, the status quo was NATO reacting to Kosovo. Andif people only looked at it, it’s just a mirror of Bosnia because there were no pictures.I’m not saying Milosevic is a nice man, but I want to know who’s actually controllinghim, and who’s controlling the Kosovo Liberation Army, etc., and all these various groups inthis conflict. And I’m absolutely in no doubt that if you did the research, you’d find that thepeople who control NATO are the same people controlling Milosevic, the same peoplecontrolling the Kosovo Liberation Army, etc., because you need to control different sides in agame to insure certainty that the outcome is the one that you want it to be.It was interesting that one of Milosevic’s advisors during the Bosnian conflict was one ofthe key advisers, a few years earlier, to Margaret Thatcher—just a coincidence, nothing toworry about. So we have these horrendous pictures coming out of Kosovo of these refugeespouring across the border and people forget that those pictures only started after the NATObombing. And the NATO bombing actually massively, massively expanded the problem"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"while claiming to be the solution. And what you have now, of course, is what they wanted allalong, which is ground troops in Kosovo, and now they’ve got control of Kosovo and thatwhole area.We’re going to see Stage Two. I would say to people: watch the Chinese hierarchy verycarefully because people who I trust, indeed, people who have been working on the inside formany years, tell me again and again, there’s a China card waiting to be played as part of theprocess of creating a conflict big enough to turn, in one conflict, NATO into a world army tostop any more conflicts of this kind.When you have the millennium mentality building up of “Come on, we’ve come to the endof a millennium. Look at the horrors of this millennium; let’s start again”, you have a globalmentality that is very open to change, and there’s nothing wrong with that except that if youcontrol the forces of communication to the global mass-mind, you can control and manipulatewhat is perceived to be positive change, when actually it is only change that relates to theagenda that you want to introduce.I actually wrote in The Biggest Secret about keeping an eye on China and the China card,and the next thing I know they’ve bombed the Chinese Embassy. Not only that, I think it wasTime magazine, about three weeks ago or so, did a virtual whole edition demonizing China asthe new monster and danger to the world. So I think we’re going to see something like thatunfold, and it will all be part of this recurring daily technique which happens in the localarea, in the states, in the country, and in the world, of creating problems and offering thesolutions to the problems.It is the key technique. If people would only get street-wise to this, they would startto see presidential announcements and terrorist bombs and wars in a very, very differentlight.I would just end the answer by saying this: The key question to ask in this situation, Iwould suggest, is: Who benefits? Who benefits from this Oklahoma City bombing? Whobenefits from the wars? And who benefits from me believing the version of these events thatI’m being asked to accept? And, again and again, when you ask that question of whobenefits, the answer is, invariably, anyone who wants to further central power.Martin: What is “The Agenda” that you refer to in your new book?Icke: When you’re getting into the lower fourth dimension and this level of it, I’m stilltrying to understand more and more clearly what the overall agenda is. It seems that,somehow, this lower fourth-dimensional consciousness, entities, whatever you want to callthem, have actually caught themselves in a prison. They’re in the lower fourth dimensionbecause they are resonating to that frequency because of their state of being. They’re intocontrol, they’re into manipulation of fear, and anyone who manipulates fear is, themselves,entrapped in fear. And as a result of that, they cannot get out of that frequency range bygoing upwards, because you can only do that by changing your mental and emotional statewhich leads to your vibrational frequency increasing, which allows you to gravitate to higherlevels.It could well be—and I’m certainly being led in this direction at the moment—that theyare trying to get out of that lower fourth dimension, or expand out of it, by coming into thethird dimension and working and controlling three dimensionally. Certainly, even if you onlytake a three-dimensional level, the agenda is for these bloodlines, which compared—this is thepoint, Rick—compared with the global population, are not large in number. They’veexpanded out of the Near and Middle East, particularly, but other places, too. And by thismanipulation of always being at the top of the pyramids—the pyramids of banking, thepyramids of politics, the pyramids of business, the pyramids of medicine, and all this stuff—they have created a situation in which they sit atop these compartmentalized pyramids and get"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"the vast majority of humanity to advance their agenda without most of them even realizingthere is an agenda being advanced.This is the only way it could be done. This is why divide and rule is vital.This is why the human herd, which, unfortunately, we’ve allowed ourselves to become,actually polices itself by making it a crime to be different. Anyone who expresses a differentview, anyone who expresses a different lifestyle, most of the rest of the herd jump on themand say “You can’t do that” and make life difficult for them, ridicule them, condemn themor whatever.So what these bloodlines have done, sitting atop these pyramidal peaks, is actually tohave manipulated the mass of the pyramid to fight itself, to war itself, to police itself—hence, divide and rule. It seems that they have had an agenda, which because it’s focus isthe lower fourth dimension, it’s had a very different version of time to us—it can see downthe three-dimensional timeline much further than we can—and it has actually had a long-term agenda, leading to the time we’re going into now, to actually have global controlthrough these global institutions of world government, world central banking, worldcurrency, world army, world centralization of all things.But, of course, if there’s only a few of you and you need to control a large number ofpeople, then it is absolutely vital that you centralize power. There are just too many areas ofpower and thought, and areas where people are making their own decisions about their ownlives. You just can’t control that without organization. You have to centralize it. And themore you centralize it, the more power those few have over the masses, which is why globalcentralization of power (and the institutions) is what they’ve been working through all thistime. And if you look at the incessant movement over these thousands of years, I’m talkingabout—it was slow to start with, and it just got faster and faster and faster as they’ve gottencontrol of more and more things.Thousands of years ago there was, to a certain extent, diversity, because people were allover the world in different cultures that were—through distance and transportation reasonsand other things, apart from the elite—I would suggest, disconnected from each other. Andthen, the more that time has moved on, the more these cultures have been able to beconnected by the emergence of technology, etc., the more it’s been possible to control theworld centrally. And they’ve now reached the point, because of the technology and thecomputer systems that exist today, where they can actually control everything from a centralpoint. And that’s what they’ve been aiming toward all this time.So, in Europe now, where I’m sitting, we have the European Union, where a fewbureaucrats in Brussels are dictating the legislation to, basically, the whole of Western Europenow. The European Union laws overpower national laws. If a national law is at odds withEuropean Union law, then the national law has to go. That’s where we’re at here in Europenow.We have a single currency, which is being expanded to be the single currency of thewhole of Europe. We have a Central Bank in Frankfurt, where Hitler was going to put hishad he won the war. And we have a situation in which the centralization of power in Europehas turned into, literally, a fascist state. The fasces, the symbol in the Roman Empire, fromwhich we get the word fascist, is actually a bundle of rods tied very tightly together aroundan axe with an axe head projecting at the top. In other words, you tie together individualexpressions and you rule them from the top with one law, one source of control. Well, thefasces symbol is actually—you actually cannot describe the European Union more simply andprofoundly than with that symbol—it is a fascist state we have in Europe.I was reading only the other day, I think it was the Miami Herald or something like that,when I was over in the Bahamas area, that they’ve now said that they want a “Free Trade”"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"area—which, of course, is what the European Union came out of—from the tip of SouthAmerica to the tip of North America, by the year 2005.I just spent a lot of time in Canada recently and they are artificially depressing the valueof the Canadian dollar so that when they offer—this is already happening in Canada, Rick, ata legislative level—when they offer Canadians the opportunity to take the American dollar astheir currency, then the Canadians will, overwhelmingly, jump at it because the value of thatcurrency is much higher than the Canadian currency. So this is the manipulation going onnow because they want the American dollar to be the currency of the whole of the Americas.Both George Bush and Bill Clinton—who are supposed to be opponents, but of coursearen’t—have both called for NAFTA to go from the tip of North America to the tip of SouthAmerica, and that’s the stage before they turn the whole of the American continent into theirversion of the European Union, which we already have here, in which a few bureaucrats at acentral point would dictate the laws for the whole of the Americas. And that, the EuropeanUnion, the American Union, they want, and something called the Pacific Union, which isbeing evolved out of a free-trade area called APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation],that’s the next level of control below the world government that they want. And under thatwill come nations and regions that will have no power at all.Interestingly, when I was in Australia, literally a few weeks ago, talking, the big story wasa sales tax that was being introduced to increase basic things like the price of food inAustralia. And, of course, Australia is not a big population, I mean, it should be a self-contained unit that would actually not be at the mercy of the world’s system—but it is,because that’s the way it’s structured. And when the politicians in government were asked,“Why on Earth do we have to have this tax?” the reply was, “We cannot act within a tradingarea” what’s the word, “a trading group, without this tax.” In other words, the tax is part ofthe submission and submergence of Australia into the APEC free trade area, which is exactlywhat is happening in Europe, and is rapidly happening in the Americas—and that is, basically,“The Agenda”.But the key to The Agenda, also, is to introduce the microchip into the population. And,again, all over the world these microchips are just waiting until we have been properlymanipulated into seeing them as a good idea:“Get your kids microchipped at birth.”“Well, you’ll never get mugged for your credit cards or your cash anymore.”“Have a little microchip with all of your financial details.”“Oh, hey, what a great idea to have all of your medical records on a little microchip,because then, if you have an accident or anything, then doctors have access to your medicalrecords just by reading the chip.”All of these things around the world, I have seen as part of the process of preparing us, asthey’ve done by using microchips in domestic animals, to be microchipped. Interesting story,Rick, this, I was approached about a year ago—I think I’ve told you this before—through athird party to meet a guy who’s been working for the CIA as a scientist for a long, longtime—most of his working life; he’s a genius in his particular area. And he jointed the CIAbecause he thought he was serving his country, as many people do—just because you’reworking for the CIA doesn’t mean you’re part of this.And he said that eventually he started to realize that they were using his genius foranything but positive reasons. They wanted his genius for very, very malevolent reasons.And he started to understand that there was this agenda that was unfolding behind the scenesthat people didn’t see.When he started rebelling against the way that his work was being used, he said he wokeup one morning and he had missing time. He remembers leaving his home, but then it’s all a"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"blank. And then the next thing he remembers is waking up in a type of medical room. Whenhe got his faculties back, he realized that he had a see-through sache, as we call them inEngland—a plastic see-through pouch-thing—they call them “patches”, apparently, in thetrade.It was on his chest and in this patch was a yellow-gold liquid. He opened his shirt, ashe’s telling me this story, and there it was. What he said was, they had manipulated his bodyto need this drug to survive, and if the drug was stopped, he would start to die. And it takesabout three months, apparently, a very painful and horrible death.This patch has to be replaced every 72 hours, and if he rebels or refuses to do anythingthey say, they don’t replace the patch and he starts to die. They’ve done it to him once, whenhe rebelled again. Now, apparently, he tells me, there are files at CIA headquarters whichhave identified scientists and people like that all over America. The same will be happeningin other countries, too, of course.They decide whether the patch is to be replaced, whether the scientist, at this point, isindispensable or dispensable, and all these things. He knows that, in the end, what they do is,when they’ve gleaned all the knowledge that you can give them, then they don’t replace thepatch because they don’t want you going around talking about it.They also do mind control on them, as well, which kind of puts a mirror, a scan, acrosstheir mind, like a veil, so they don’t remember much of it anyway when they leave theseprojects.What he said to me was a number of things. First of all he said, big time, watch China,because that’s part of The Agenda. The other thing he said—as you well know, as much asanyone—the technology has existed for a very long time to cure cancer. The technology hasexisted for a very long time to give us all the free energy we need, without utility bills. Andhe said another thing interesting, which was in his area of expertise; he said, “You know, thetechnology exists to create abundant growth in deserts, without water, using magnetics.” Hesaid, “At it’s most optimum, you can see the crops grow like a time-lapse photograph.” Thereis no need for anyone to be hungry, anywhere in the world.But the point of telling you that story, apart from the interest of it, is that he said,basically, “If people are going to say no to just one thing, please tell them to say no to themicrochip.” He said this is because the microchip is not just about electronic tagging, assome conspiracy people think. Yes, it’s about that, on one level, and it’s certainly not justabout making it easier to find your child. He said people don’t realize the level of technologythat exists.He said the real use of the microchip in the population is to give external control ofpeople’s thinking and emotional processes through external signals and pulses. He said thesemicrochips, once they’re inside you, the pulses that they send out to them—and a lot of theStar Wars thing is all, actually, the veil for the technology to control these microchips—theywill be able to externally make you aggressive or docile, sexually aroused, sexuallysuppressed, suppress your intellectual state so that you stop thinking to your capacity. Andthe idea is to literally turn humanity into a race of externally manipulated robots.We are now in a situation where these microchips exist and they’re just waiting for,probably, “problem, reaction, solution” to create a situation in which the chips becomeaccepted.And, it’s interesting, when I spoke in South Africa last year, I got a heck of a lot ofpublicity very soon after I arrived because they didn’t realize what I was saying, and a lot ofthese things were live, of course. So, I was out there talking, and before they realized what Iwas saying, in a matter of three or four days, I talked live for 25 minutes to 29 Africancountries, on one occasion. As a result of this there was tremendous interest. Winnie"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Mandela came to one of my talks. I had a private meeting with P. W. Botha, the formerPresident of South Africa. I’ll tell you a story about him in a second. There was tremendousinterest.One of the journalists who’d interviewed me on one of their main Current Affairsprograms called me about two days later and he said, “I’ve had a very funny chap callingme.” He rang, he said, and he didn’t see the show but someone had told him about it. Andhe said he demanded to know how I, Icke, knew about the microchip plan.What it turned out is that this guy got the wrong end of the stick. He’d got the impressionthat I’d gone on this Current Affairs program and talked about the South Africa microchipprogram. I knew nothing about it, at the time. What I was talking about, of course, was themicrochip agenda, globally. Anyway, this guy, as a result of thinking I’d talked about it,blurted out some things because he was saying, “No one should know about this! Everyone’sbeen sworn to secrecy!”And the journalist said, “What are you talking about?”And the caller said there was a company in South Africa which had been producing themicrochips for the South African people, and they’d all been sworn—Official Secrets Act andall this stuff—not to talk about it and that the agenda that they were working toward shouldnot be known by the South African people. This came out as a result of him thinking I’dblurted it all out, and I hadn’t—I’d just talked about the global thing. So these things arehappening in every country.But the P.W. Botha thing is interesting. This is a nice one, and it’s never come outbefore. I mentioned it in The Biggest Secret, I think. Never came out, to my knowledge.Winnie Mandela came to one of my talks in Johannesburg, I mean, a thousand people turnedup! They were going crazy for it in South Africa. After a lot of publicity, I got a call fromthe daughter of P. W. Botha, who was President during the apartheid years when Mandela wasinvolved in the ’80s, with F.W. de Klerk, and it was de Klerk who lead Mandela out and allthat stuff, which again was all part of The Agenda.It just turned South Africa from overt control to covert control—and of course, the worldhas walked away now, no longer paying attention—with the same people, the Oppenheimerfamily, running South Africa as they did before. It’s just that no one is exposing it anymorebecause South Africa is free, you know, I read it in the newspaper somewhere.His daughter said that Botha wanted to meet me. Now, as synchronicity would have it, Iwas talking at a small place, the only small place I spoke at, actually—I did the cities,mainly—and not far from down the coast from Port Elizabeth, and it just so happened thatfifteen minutes from the point of the talk lived P. W. Botha in retirement. So I went to seehim.He was talking to me—I found it really bizarre, Rick, to be honest! I’m sitting theretalking to the former President of South Africa, and he’s asking me about the way in whichthis manipulation works. He’s naming all the names like Kissinger and Carrington andRockefeller, and all these people who manipulated South Africa, but he hadn’t genuinely seenthat actually South Africa was just one element in a global agenda. He thought they just hadit in for South Africa.When you realize that you can get to that level and people still don’t bloody know what’sgoing on, the compartmentalization just takes your breath away.We started talking about the Rothschilds—this is the point—and he said, “Oh, yeah, I hadan interesting meeting with the Rothschilds. In the 1980s I was asked to host a meeting withthe English Rothschilds in Capetown.”He said the Rothschilds told him that there was money in Swiss bank accounts, greatwealth in Swiss bank accounts, which once belonged to German Jews, and was available for"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"investment in South Africa, if they could agree on interest rates. In other words, thisRothschild family, who are held up as like bastions of Judaism, and supporters and defendersof Jewish people, have actually been lending money in Swiss bank accounts that oncebelonged to German Jews, and making a fortune from it, ever since the war. And P. W.Botha can vouch for this because he was offered it, in the 1980s in Cape Town.This is what Jewish people really ought to get wise to—that the Rothschilds are not ontheir side, not in the least, and they have manipulated Jewish people as much as anyone else.And, of course, one of the funders of Adolf Hitler, which starts to make things even moreclear and starts to fit the picture even more clearly, why the banking family that funded andbankrolled Hitler, to a large extent, would, after the war, be having control of the money fromGerman Jews in Swiss bank accounts, to the point where they could use it for their own gainever since. And this, of course, is the money that came to light in the last couple of years andhas caused this great scandal about people being denied their money.Martin: You’ve stated that you’ve observed people waking up around the world. In thefinal analysis, what does that mean?Icke: It seems that there is a cycle, which we’re coming toward the end of, which isacting—it’s a vibrational cycle, in terms of it’s effect on the Earth’s field—which is actinglike a spiritual alarm clock. It’s beginning to wake people up from what I call the “terrestrialtrance”, the spiritual slumber is so long.And this is why people close to Kissinger during the ’70s have told me that it wasKissinger and his cronies who actually created what we call the New-Age Movement, animportant point, this, vital. When I’ve said this, people have said, “Well, that’s ridiculous!”Is it, really?There’s a vibrational cycle going on which is waking people up. Now, apart from goingto the Sun and switching it off, or changing it’s vibrational cycle, whatever, you have oneother alternative—and that is to take awakening people, and put them in a position, preferablyabout a foot below the ceiling, where awakening people—on one level—are not going tobecome a danger to your agenda. And what they’ve done is, they’re taking the spirituallyawakening people and they’ve put them on the ceiling, overwhelmingly. Not all, by anymeans, but great, great numbers of them. And in that place they are not involved inspirituality as change, they’re involved in spirituality as escapism, spirituality as denial,spirituality as an excuse not to get your hands dirty in the three-dimensional world. They arein complete denial—most of those people, not all by any means, but most—of the fact thatthis manipulation is going on.I keep hearing this, “Oh, it’s negative. We shouldn’t be talking about this.” And then, onthe other side, those who have identified the problem in America are overwhelmingly theChristian Patriot Movement, not exclusively by any means, but overwhelmingly that’s thefocus of so much of it. And they think that spirituality, as expressed metaphysically in theNew-Age stuff, is the bloody devil.So what the Illuminati have done magnificently is detach the metaphysical understandingof how we can get out of here from the three-dimensional, street-wise awareness of themanipulation. So, they’ve taken the problem and the solution and they’ve got one to identifythe problem, and they’ve got the solution to be a denial there’s a problem to solve, if youfollow me.Martin: I do.Icke: And they’ve done it brilliantly. And this is why Kissinger put out some of theNew-Age big names, and still controls many of them who are still persuading people that, ineffect, the cavalry is going to come. And, so often, when you look at New-Age thought, it ismerely another way of expressing a religious bloody thought. You know, instead of giving"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"your mind away to dieties or whatever, you’re giving your mind away to gurus or to bloodyexternal entities and stuff.I’m not saying that we should not look at this information, but we have to filter it throughour own “truth detector” and come to our own truth, rather than having us be told by someoneelse how we should live our lives and how we should think and how we should see the world.And in so many areas the New-Age movement has become just another form of religionand control. And I’ll tell you what, in areas of the New-Age movement that I’ve experienced,you go against the “party line” and you see what happens. You know, it’s just like goingagainst the party line of Christianity or going against the party line of the Pope—you getjumped on by the majority.And individualism, while they talk about the necessity for it, the desire for it, is constantlycrushed by the belief system of the group. It’s interesting, you know, when I talk about thisin my talks, everywhere I go in the world I get applause from the audience. Because I thinkpeople are starting to get sick of the New-Age movement, which is actually so often divertingus from and suppressing us from the real truth of metaphysics. And the real truth is that WE,as individuals, are in control of our destiny, and not external forces being in control.And so, I think it’s very important, in the years that we are in now, that we start to takeour individual sovereignty back and start to realize that we have the right to decide our truthand live our truth, and not have another truth imposed upon us, whether it’s the New-Agemovement, Christianity, Hinduism, Atheism, or whatever it is, because the whole basis of thecontrol is getting individuality subordinated to the group, getting individuality suppressed bythe majority, suppressed by the herd mentality.There are two ways of solving the problem. We can find the solution to it, which isactually not the best way, because for me the best way of solving a problem is removing thecause of it and then it goes away. The cause of the few controlling the planet is peoplegiving their power away and not thinking for themselves and just following the one in frontwithout question. And, insisting—and this is the key thing, stage two—insisting that othersdo the same, because once that happens, you create a situation in which whoever sets thenorms in the world, whether considered sane or insane, possible or impossible, moral orimmoral, whoever sets those norms runs the world.This happens because of the overwhelming, vast majority of humanity who have giventheir power away and given their thinking processes and individuality away, and will livetheir lives in accordance with those dictated norms because they’re not thinking orquestioning them.Now, that’s fine, that’s a choice—I don’t have a problem with that. The key thing, as Isay, the people who succumb to those norms, they insist that those who don’t want to do soshould also succumb to those norms. And, at that point, when you have the herd policingitself, and making life unpleasant for those who wish to detach from it, at that point you havethe basis, and only at that point, you have the basis on which the few who set the norms canrun the world, because you get humanity becoming not just the sheep, but also the sheep-dog,not just the prisoner, but also the prison guards. And only in that way, through thousands ofyears to the present minute, has it been possible for a few to control the world.So, for me, three things would change this and would dramatically transform the worldwe live in for the better, because of all that would come from this. Those are:One: as individuals, we step out of the fear of what other people think of us because thatis the prison that most people live in. And once you’re in the fear of what someone elsethinks, you are not living YOUR life in YOUR truth; you are living someone else’s versionof what they think you should be. In other words, you’re in the herd now. If we step outof the fear of what other people think, as individuals, and say, to use the title of one of my"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"books, I Am Me, I Am Free, and if you don’t like it, that’s fine—you have a right not tolike it—but this is me! At that point we cease to be a sheep. And if enough of us do it,we cease to be a herd of sheep.Second: we allow everyone else to express their uniqueness, even though it differs fromours. You know, “What a crime; call the police; my goodness me, this person thinksdifferent than me!” Once we do that, we cease to be a sheep dog for the rest of the herd.Just those two things alone, and this whole edifice of imposed power starts to crumblebecause the very basis of it is crumbling.And third: the balance point, no one seeks to impose what they believe on anyone else,so all are respecting everyone’s free will, so that my belief is not imposed on anyone else.That’s the reason why whatever anyone says about me or says about what I write or what Isay, I am completely at peace with that because they have a right to think what they want tothink. They only need to respect my right to have the same honor of having my feelingsalso honored, as my right to express them. This is why, when conspiracy theorists hurlabuse at others who say something different, I think they’ve lost the plot.So, those three things would bring this edifice of power crumbling down, becausethey’re the three things, in reverse, that allow the few to run the world. If we didn’tconcede our mentality to a herd mentality, and if we didn’t insist that the people around usdid the same, and if we respected everyone’s right to express their uniqueness withouthaving ours imposed upon them, then the ability of the few to control the planet would beremoved, immediately, because those three things have to be in place—the herd mentality,the herd policing itself, imposing your will on others.If those three things are not in place, you can’t control centrally, it’s impossible. Andwe have the ability and we have the choice, and that’s all it is, now, to reverse those things,to remove them, just by how we react and act with each other, and bring this edifice ofpower crumbling down. And this is the point, as all the circle starts to connect itself, whenwe get, Rick, into that state of being where we respect our own uniqueness and right toexpress it, when we start to celebrate and glory in diversity instead of scorning it, when weallow other people to have that same privilege, when we don’t seek to impose our will ontoothers, at that point our vibrational state—because of our emotional and mental state ofbeing—starts to vibrate quicker and quicker and quicker and we start to reconnect withthose higher dimensions of ourselves and we start to become whole, multi-dimensionalbeings again instead of disconnected fragments, caused by the vibration of fear andaggression and imposition.So, actually, everything connects to everything else. And so, if we set ourselves freeand set each other free, we become vibrationally reconnected and therefore free of thislower fourth-dimensional manipulation. Everything comes from our state of being andwe’re in complete control of that. Which is why only a few can control the world, becausewe’ve conceded our right to be who we are to somebody else.Martin: That’s a perfect place to end.[Editor’s note: Rick Martin may be reached directly at the following email address:rickm@tminet.com for those of you with computer Internet access.]"}]
