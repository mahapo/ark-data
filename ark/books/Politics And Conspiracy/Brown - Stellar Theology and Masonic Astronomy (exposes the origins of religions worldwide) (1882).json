The Purpose of Signs and Symbols Signs and symbols are not merely for decoration or ran- dom meaningless marks without purpose. Signs and sy mbols have real, specific and precise meanings. Also, sig ns and sym- bols usually have ONE PURPOSE — to identify, and the identifi- cation is expressed in two ways — (1) by showing ownership, and (2) by showing direction. Signs and symbols can show ownership. \"Property of the United States Government — Keep Out.\" For businesse s own- ership is expressed by signs on store windows to te ll you what the store is selling, special sales, hours of opera tion, directions to other stores, or telephone numbers. When the sig ns and symbols are \"occult\" (cleverly concealed or hidden) using astronomical and Masonic signification, ownership i s also being expressed. Signs also identify what direction you are travelin g (\"Route 22\" or \"San Diego, 3 miles\"), or what you should do (\"Eat at This Restaurant,\" \"Shop at That Grocery\" or \"STOP.\" ) Highway signs, now international in usage, have generic ico ns recogniz- able for children and those with minimum education.

I propose to you that such signs and symbols demon- strate ownership and point the public in a desired direction. Advertising, the world over, uses familiar signs an d sym- bols so that the potential buyer can readily recogn ize the product, service or company selling the product. Questions, Questions Why are astronomical signs and symbols on those bui ld- ings and in advertising? They show purpose and direction.

It demonstrates how to find the congregation that plac es the phallus at the topmost of their church building so it can be seen from afar. It demonstrates ownership by displa ying a phallus for the entire community to see. Once again, if such things have no meaning, WHY is the pagan symbol used?

The phallus on churches (and synagogues, and mosques) is one ex ample of many emblems, symbols, and signs used in modern- day religions all over the world. 1 Unless you know the meaning behind the symbols, you won't understand — WHY THEY ARE USED .

Fewer still have any knowledge of the occult or hid den con- nections between Judaism, Christianity, the Bible — and W ORLD F REEMASONRY . Unless and until such occult knowl- edge of religious symbols is understood, we will ha ve nothing but the same confusion we have had for the last 2,0 00 years! In Chapter 2 Brown gives an account of the ancient mys- tery systems and the early forms of worship. Egypti an, Indian, Eleusinian, Bacchanal, Ceres, and Dionysiac mysteri es are mentioned. An understanding of these Mysteries is e ssential. Chapter 3 contains a brief rundown of basic astrono mical facts. One cannot understand what follows without k nowing the basic terminology and concepts of astronomy. Chapter 4 concludes Part One by describing what the ancient civilizations knew about astronomy and how they made their calculations and predictions about the h eavens.

Chapter 5 shows Masonic astronomy in the architecture, words and ritual of Freemasonry. The relation- ship between the Masonic ritual and the symbols wit h the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem is revealed.

It contains an astronomical explanation of the emblems, symbols and legends of the mys- teries. It shows how the ancient mysteries are made modern, and the meaning of many of them is restored for pre sent day. Brown goes into detail regarding the Masonic symbol s and the astronomical relationships. The basics of the Zodia c and the signification of each of the astrological houses ar e made clear. Pillars, globes and the meanings behind them are ex plained. Sacred numbers and the days of the week are discuss ed so they become clear. The meaning of the word \"mystery \" itself and its relationship with Masonry is shown. In Chapter 9, Brown's short conclusion claims that he has defended Freemasonry and vindicated its claims.

The \"essential secrets\" of freemasonry are defined by Dr. Oliver, in his \"Dictionary of Symbolical Masonry,\" as consisting of nothing more, than the signs, grips, passwords, and tokens essential to the preservation of the society from the inroads of impostors, together with certain symbolical emblems, the technical terms apper- 2"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Chapter I.

The masonic reade r should also bear in mind that many things in the following pages, which are to him full of masonic significance, will appear to the uninitiated but an expression of some of the si mplest facts in the science of astronomy, long established and k nown to all. Says Gadicke, a masonic writer of repute: With the increase of enlightenment and rational ref lec- tion, it is admitted that a brother may both speak and write much upon the order without becoming a traito r to its secrets.... Inquiries into the history of th e order, and the true meaning of its hieroglyphics and ceremo- nies by learned brethren, cannot be considered treason, for the order itself recommends the study of its hi story, and that every brother should instruct his fellows as much as possible. It is the same with the printed e xpla- nation of the moral principles and symbols of the order. We are recommended to study them incessantly, until we have made ourselves masters of the valuable info r- mation they contain; and, when our learned and cau- tious brethren publish the result of their inquirie s, they ought to be most welcome to the craft. These remarks of Gadicke are quoted with approbatio n by Dr. Oliver, who himself says, in the introduction t o his \"Land- marks\": 3"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy No hypothesis can be more untenable than that which forebodes evil to the masonic institution from the publi- cation of scientific treatises illustrative of its philosophy and moral tendency. The lodge lectures, in their mo st ample and extended form, however pleasing and instructive soever they may be, are unsatisfactory and inconclusive. They are merely elementary, and do no t amply and completely illustrate any one peculiar do c- trine. As they are usually delivered in nine tenths of the lodges, they are monotonous, and not perfectly adap ted to the end for which they are framed, or for the ef fect they are intended to produce. For this reason it is that literary and scientific men, who have been tempted to join our ranks in the hope of opening a new source of intellectual enjoyment, and of receiving an accessi on of novel ideas for their reflection and delight, so fr e- quently retire, if not with disgust, at least with mixed feelings of sorrow and regret, at the unprofitable sacri- fice of so much valuable time which might have been applied to a better purpose. He adds that, if the authorized lectures of masonry were amplifie d and illustrated, such instances would not only rare ly occur, but our lodges would become the resort of al l the talent and intelligence in the country. Dr. Mackey, who in America holds the highest rank a s a masonic writer, says: The European masons are far more liberal in their v iews of the obligation of secrecy than the English or Am eri- cans. There are few things, indeed, which a French or German masonic writer will refuse to discuss with t he utmost frankness. It is now beginning to be general ly admitted—and English and American writers are actin g on the admission—that the only real aporrheta (essen- tial secrets) of freemasonry are the modes of recog ni- tion and the peculiar and distinctive ceremonies of the order, and to these last it is claimed that reference may be publicly made for the purpose of scientific investiga- tion, provided that the reference be made so as to be 4"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Chapter I.

The sun is the most splendid and glorious object in nature. The regularity of its course knows no change. It is \"th e same yesterday, today, and forever.\" It is the phys ical and magnetic source of all life and motion. Its lig ht is a type of eternal truth; its warmth of universal bene vo- lence. It is therefore not strange that man in all ages has selected the sun as the highest and most perfect emblem of God.

The Ancient Mysteries Described most nations forgot the worship of the true God, an d began to adore the sun itself, which they thus deified and p ersonified. The sun thus personified was made the theme of alle gorical history, emblematic of his yearly passage through t he twelve constellations. The zodiac is the apparent path of the sun among th e stars. It was divided by the ancients into twelve equal pa rts, com- posed of the clusters of stars, named after \"living creatures,\" typical of the twelve months. This glittering belt of stars was therefore called the zodiac, that word meaning \"living crea- tures,\" being derived from the greek word zodiakos, which comes from zo-on, an animal. This latter word is compounded directly from the primitive Egyptian radicals, zo, life, and on, a being. The sun, as he pursued his wan among these \"living crea- tures\" of the zodiac, was said, in allegorical lang uage, either to assume the nature of or to triumph over the sign he entered. The sun thus became a Bull in Taurus, and was worshiped as such by the Egyptians under the name of Apis, and b y the Assyrians as Bel, Baal, or Bul. In Leo the sun became a Lion- slayer, Hercules, and an Archer in Sagittarius. In Pisces, the Fishes—he was a fish—Dagon, or Vishnu, the fish-god of the Philistines and Hindoos. When the sun enters Capricornus he reaches his lowest southern declination; afterward as he emerges from that sign the days become longer, and the Sun grows rapidly in light and heat; hence we are told in the mythology that the Sun, or Jupiter, was suckled by a goat. The story of the twelve labors of Hercules is but an al legory of the passage of the sun through the twelve signs of the zodiac, and past the constellations of proximity thereto. The beautiful virgin of the zodiac, Virgo, together with the Moon, under a score of different names, furnishes t he female element in these mythological stories, the wonderfu l adven- tures of the gods.

This key was religious ly kept secret by the priests and philosophers, and was onl y imparted to those who were initiated into the M YSTERIES . The profane and vulgar crowd were kept in darkness, and believe d in and worshiped a real Hercules or Jupiter, whom they tho ught actu- ally lived and performed all the exploits and under went all the transformations of the mythology. By these means the priests of Egypt ruled the peopl e with a despotic power. The fables of the mythology discl osed to them grand scientific truths, and to them only. The very stories themselves served to perpetuate those truths for th e benefit of the initiated, and also formed an easy vehicle for their trans- mission. Books were not only rare and difficult of multiplica- tion, but it is also probable that, in order that s cientific knowledge might be concealed, it was considered unl awful to commit it to writing. If in special cases it became an absolute necessity to do so, the sacred hieroglyphs were emp loyed. These were known only to the initiated; there was a nother sort of written characters used by the common people. (R awlin- son's \"Herodotus,\" Appendix to Book II, Chapter V.) Science was thus for the most part orally transmitt ed from one hierophant to another. While an abstruse and di fficult lec- ture is not easy, either to remember or to repeat, on the con- trary, a mythological tale can with ease be retaine d in the memory and communicated to another, together with t he key for interpretation. These fables, therefore, served a threefold purpose: 1. They kept the secrets of science from all but those who understood the key to them; 2. Being themselves easy to remember, they served on t he principle of the art of mnemonics, or artificial memory, to keep alive the recollection of scientific facts which otherwise might be lost; 8"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Chapter 2.

The science in which the Egyptian priesthood were m ost proficient, and which they most jealously guarded, was that of astronomy. The people worshiped the sun, moon, and stars as gods, and a knowledge of their true nature would ha ve at once put an end to the influence of the priests, wh o were believed by the ignorant and superstitious crowd to be able to withhold or dispense, by prayers, invocations, and sacrifices, the divine favor. The priest of a pretended god, wh en once his god is exposed, stands before the world a convicted impostor. To deny the divinity of the sun, moon, and stars, o r, what was the same thing, to permit science to disclose their true nature to the masses of the people was consequently held b y the priesthood of Egypt as the highest of crimes. By a knowledge of astronomy the priests were able to calculate and to predict eclipses of the sun and moon, events beheld with su perstitious awe and fear by the multitude. Seeing how certainly these pre- dictions, when thus made, were fulfilled, the pries ts were credited with the power to foretell other events, a nd to look into the future generally. So they cast horoscopes and assumed to be prophets. Of course, a knowledge of astronomy diffused among the people would have been fatal to these pretensions. The facts of astronomy were therefore, for these reasons most carefully hidden from the common people, and the priesthood o nly communicated them to each other, veiled in allegori cal fables, the key to which was disclosed to him only who had taken the highest degrees of the Mysteries, and given the mos t convinc- ing proofs of his fidelity and zeal.

Thus, we are told, in the Egyptian sacred legend, t hat Osirus, or the Sun, was slain by Typhon, a gigantic monster, typical of darkness and the evil powers of nature. The body was placed in a chest, thrown into the Nile, and sw ept out to sea. Isis, or the Moon personified as a goddess, ra nsacks the whole earth in search of the body, which she finds horribly mutilated. She joins the dissevered parts, and rais es him to life again. In the Greek mythology we are told that Adonis (the Lord, or sun-god) is slain, but it returns to life again for six months each year—thus dying in the fall and winter months and returning to life again during the spring and summe r. The ritual of the Mysteries in Egypt, India and Gre ece, was founded upon this legend, in some form, of the deat h and res- urrection of the personified sun-god. The Egyptian Mysteries of Osiris and Isis were in t he form of a mystic drama, representing the death by violen ce of Osiris (the sun-god), the search for his body by Isis, the Moon, and its finding and being raised to life and power agai n. In the cel- ebration of these Mysteries the neophyte was made to perform all the mysterious wanderings of the goddess amid t he most frightful scenes. He was guided by one of the initi ated, who wore a mask representing a dog's head, in allusion to the bright star Sothis (Sirius, or the dog-star), so called because the rising of that star each year above the horizon jus t before day gave warning of the approaching inundation of the N ile. The word Sothis means the \"barker,\" or \"monitor.\" The candidate was by this guide conducted through a dark and mysterious labyrinth.

The attack of Typhon, or the spirit of darkness, typical of the evil powers of nature, upon Osiris, who was slain, was also enacted as the initiation progressed, and amid the most terrible scenes, during which the \"judgment of the dead\" was also represented, and the punishments of the wicked exhib- ited as realities to the candidate. The search for the body of Osiris, which was concealed in the mysterious chest or \"ark,\" followed. The mutilated remains were at last found, and deposited amid loud cries of sorrow and despair. Th e initiation closed with the return of Osirus to life and power.

In India the chief deity was triune, and consisted of Brahma, the Creator, Vishnu, the Preserver, and Siva, the Destroyer. Brahma was the representative of the ris ing sun, and the others respectively of the meridian and the setting sun. The aspirant having been sprinkled with water and divested of his shoes, was causing to circumambulat e the altar three times. At the east, west, and south points of the mystic c ircle were stationed triangularly the three representatives of the sun-god, denoting the rising, setting, and meridian sun. Eac h time the aspirant arrived in the sough he was made to exclai m, \"I copy the example of the sun, and follow his benevolent c ourse.\" After further ceremonies, consisting in the main of solemn admonitions by the chief Brahman to lead a life of purity and holiness, the aspirant was again placed in charge o f his con- ductor, and enjoined to maintain strict silence und er the sever- est penalty; told to summon up all his fortitude an d betray no symptoms of cowardice. Amid the gloom then began bewailings for the loss o f the sun-god Sita, followed by ceremonies of fearful import, and scenic representations of a terrible nature. The ca ndidate was made to personify Vishnu, and engaged in a contest with the powers of darkness, which, as the representative of the god, he subdued. This was followed by a dazzling display of light, and a view of Brahma exalted, glorified, and triump hant.

He was next made to behold the torments of the wicked in H ades. This was followed by a view of Elysium, and the ini tiation concluded by a display of divine light and the fina l triumph of Ormuzd, the sun-god, over all the powers of darkness. In Greece the Mysteries were denominated as the les ser and greater Mysteries. A chosen few only were admit ted to the latter, and they were bound to secrecy by the most frightful oaths. The Eleusinian Mysteries were performed by the Athe nians at Eleusis every fifth year, and were subsequently introduced at Rome by Adrian. These Mysteries were the same as those of Orpheus. A magnificent temple of vast extent having been erected for their celebration at Eleusis, they subs equently became known as the Eleusinian Mysteries. The princ ipal officers who conducted the ceremonies were the Hier ophant, the Torch-Bearer, the Priest, the Archon, or King, and the Mystagogue. The hierophant appeared seated upon a magnificent throne, adorned with gold. He was dressed in a roya l robe; over his head a rainbow was arched, and there also the moon and seven stars were seen. Around his neck was susp ended a golden globe. These expressive symbols all point al l the fact that the hierophant represented the sun.

The priest officia ted at the altar, and bore the symbol of the moon, being, like the Egyp- tian priests of Isis, devoted to her service. The archon, or king, preserved order, offered also prayers and sacrifices, compelled all unworthy and uninitia ted persons to retire at the order of the mystagogue, and punis hed all who presumed to disturb the sacred rites. The aspirant was required to pass through a period of probation, during which he pre- pared himself by chastity, fasting, prayer, and pen itence.

After being thus \"duly and truly p repared\" he was delivered over to the Mystagogue, who began the initia- tion by the prescribed proclamation: \"Exas, exas, este Bebeloi!\" — (\"Depart hence, all ye profane!\") The aspirant was then conducted on a long and painf ul pilgrimage through many dark and circuitous passage s: sometimes it seemed to him as if he were ascending steep hills, walking over flinty ground, which tore his feet at every step, and again down deep valleys and through dense and difficult forests.

He says, \"I approached the confines of death, and, having trod on the threshold of Proserpine, and I returned ther efrom, being borne through all the elements.\" As the aspirant thus wanders among these startling scenes, surrounded by the wild cries and lamentations of th e goddess and her train, at a signal from the hierophant a su dden turn is given to their feelings. The gloom begins to disapp ear, and their cries of grief are changed to joyful and triu mphant shouts of \"Eurekamen, eurekamen!\" (\"We have found it!\") The euresis, or discovery of the body, is then celebrated, and t he mangled form of the murdered sun-god restored from death and darkness to life and light and power.

The death of the sun-god, whom the \"aspirant, \" dramati- cally represented, was the main characteristic of t hem all.

But, although the legend of initiation was thus sub stantially the same in all the civilized nations of antiquity, yet it must be borne in mind that the allegory of the death and re turn to life of the sun-god was naturally and necessarily modifi ed in its minor details so as to conform to the different con ditions of climate and order of the seasons, which prevailed i n the vari- ous countries, into which it was adopted from Egypt . The Egyptians divided the year into seasons peculiar to them- selves, consequent upon the exceptional nature of t heir coun- try, where all agricultural pursuits were dependent upon and regulated by the yearly inundation of the Nile. The y divided the year into three seasons of four months each: th e first was called the season of \"Planets, \" and originally included Novem- ber, December, January, and February; the second wa s termed the season of \"Flowering, \" or \"Harvest, \" and included March, April, May, and June; the third was known as the se ason of \"Waters, \" or \"Inundation, \" alluding to the overflow of the Nile, and originally consisted of July, August, Sep tember, and October.

It was there- fore found to be necessary to make a correction of the calen- dar, which was done by observations taken of the he liacal rising of the dog-star Sothis, or Sirius. In their sacred calendar, however, the Egyptian priests appear to have retain ed the \"vague\" or indefinite year of three hundred and six ty days, so that the festivals of the gods illustrating the leg end of Osiris might pass through all the different seasons of the year. (Wilkinson's \"Ancient Egyptians,\" vol. ii, chapter viii.) This ignorance of the true length of the solar year prod uced also a similar confusion in the times of celebrating the f estival of the gods in other countries, so that a festival, origin ally intended (for instance) to celebrate the arrival of the sun at the summer solstice, with appropriate ceremonies, might come t o fall in winter, when the nature of those ceremonies had no harmony with the season. In like manner a festival, origina lly intended to celebrate the new birth of the sun at the winter solstice, would in process of time come to be held in the sum mer, and thus be in utter violation of the solar allegory.

The neglect of the function of a year in the calend ar does not appear to amount to much, but owing to this cau se alone, the first of January in the time of Julius Caesar h ad fallen back so as to nearly coincide with the autumnal equinox. Caesar corrected the calendar, but, in order to do so, was obliged to make an extraordinary year of four hundred and fort y-five days; this was called \"the year of confusion.\" This correction made by Caesar did not prevent the recurrence of th e same evil, for in process of time it was found that the seasons again began to disagree with the almanac, and the religio us festivals of the Christian Church, like those of its pagan pr edecessor began to fall out of place. This led to the correct ion made by Pope Gregory, and the subsequent adoption of our pr esent method of keeping the calendar correct. The solar a llegory, when it was introduced into countries north of Egyp t, and whose agriculture was not regulated by the overflow of the Nile, was modified, as we have seen, in some partic ulars, in order to harmonize the allegory with the climate an d order of seasons which prevailed in those countries; but any want of correspondence that subsequently existed between th e festi- vals, originally intended to celebrate the summer a nd winter solstices and the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, an d the true time of the sun's arrival at those points, was due to an imper- fect calendar, resulting from an ignorance of the l ength of the solar year. Another cause which had the effect to obscure the o riginal astronomical signification of the mythological tale s of antiquity is the phenomenon known as the \"precession of the equi- noxes, \" which has also changed the order of the seasons, so far as the same is marked by the entrance of the su n into par- ticular constellations of the zodiac, at certain pe riods of the year.

That, while these two great doctrines were also originally taug ht in all the ancient Mysteries, by the use of the same astronomi cal allego- ries and symbols, freemasonry alone retained its pr imitive truth and purity, while the others degenerated into a corrupt 23"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy system of solar worship. The sun, originally intend ed as a symbol only of the true God, was in time confounded with the person of God himself, and thus itself worshipped a s a God.

The Rev. Dr . Oliver, whose great learning will be disputed by none, says : The poets, historians, and philosophers of Greece, all of whom had been initiated into the Mysteries, unite in describing the Supreme Being as ONE single, divine, and unapproachable essence, who created and governs the world. And in India the Supreme Deity is thus m ade to describe himself, in one of the sacred books, wh ich has been preserved and transmitted from an unknown period: \"I was even at first not any other thing; t hat which exists, the supreme; and afterward I am that which is; and he who must remain am I.\" (\"Landmarks,\" Lecture XXI) In the notes to this lecture of Dr. Oliver's, much valuable information on this point is also collected and con densed.

It is a t ranslation made in 1656 by command of the Sultan Darah of an Oupanishat, a word meaning the secret that is not to be revealed: And what was this great mystery which was so carefu lly concealed in those ancient books? Like the secret o f the Egyptian and Grecian Mysteries, it was nothing less than the Unity of the Godhead, under the name of Ruder, which is thus explained in another of their sacred books: The angels have assembled themselves together in heaven before Ruder, made obeisance and asked him, \"O Ruder, what art thou?\" Ruder replied: \" Were there any other, I would describe myself by a similitude. I always was, I always am, I always shall be. There is no other, so that I can say to you, I am like him. In this ME is the inward essence and the exterior substance of all things.

But in the Aryan world the Veda is certainly the oldest book, and its preservation amounts almost to a marv el. (See \"Lecture on the Vedas,\" at Leeds, 1865) Muller in the same lecture fixes the date of the Ve das at \"between twelve and fifteen hundred years before th e Chris- tian era.\" This is over three thousand years ago. Dr. Oliver, in Note 34 to his lectures before quote d, informs us that Zoroaster taught that God is the first—incorruptible, eternal, unmade, in visi- ble—most unlike everything—the leader or author of all good—unbribable—the best of the good—the wisest of the wise. With all this evidence before him, and actually quo ted in his writings, Dr. Oliver, strange as it may appear, is in the con- stant habit, in his works, of branding without dist inction all the ancient Mysteries as \"spurious freemasonry,\" an epi thet which he invented, and which has been adopted by a few ot hers. But, if the sublime views of God above quoted are \" spurious,\" where shall we look for the genuine ones, for those taught in freemasonry today are the same? Late discoveries make the fact, that the unity of G od was taught in the ancient Egyptian Mysteries, beyond al l doubt. \"The manifold forms of the Egyptian pantheon\" (says the late E.

Therefore the Egyptians never spoke the unknown name, but used a phrase which expressed the self-existenc e of the eternal, \"I am,\" (Ritual of the Dead.) Says John Newenham Hoare, in the late article in th e \"Nineteenth Century\": The Egyptians tried to realize God by taking some n atu- ral object which should in itself convey to their m inds some feature in God's nature. This became a necessi ty for the priests in the religious teaching of the pe ople. Therefore in the sun they saw God manifested as the light of the world. The more fully they felt the in finite nature of God, the more they would seek in nature f or symbols.... All the deities were regarded as manife sta- tions of the one great Creator, the uncreated, the Father of the universe. This is expressed in the following hymn: Hail to the Lord of the lapse of time, king of gods ! Thou of many names, of holy transformations, of mysterious forms. Nevertheless, as in Greece and India, so also in an cient Egypt, the symbols became in the popular mind actual gods, and the people degenerated into gross idolatr y. \"They changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made by corruptible man, and to birds, and to four-footed beasts, and creeping things,... and the y changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather than the creator.\" (Rom. 1:23-25) This is unfortunately the aspect in which the Egypt ian Pantheon has presented itself to mankind for many centuries. 28"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. The Ancient Mysteries Described The conception of the unity of the Godhead did not prevent the Egyptians from thinking of God as very near to them.

As we might expect, from so lofty a conception of G od, their hearts broke forth into joyous hymns of prais e: \"Hail to thee, all creatures! Salutation from every land.

The honor due to parents sprang naturally from the belief in God as \"Our Father, which art in heaven.\" We constantly find inscriptions on the tombs such as t he following: \"I honored my father and mother; I loved my brothers; I taught little children; I took care of orphans as though they had been my own children.\" In letter s of excellent advice, addressed by an old man one hundr ed and ten years of age to a young friend (which forms the most ancient book in the world, dating 3000 B.C.), he says: \"The obedience of a docile son is a blessing. God loves obedience. Disobedience is hated by God. The obedience of a son maketh glad the heart of his fat her. a son teachable in God's service will be happy in c on- sequence of his obedience. He will grow to be old, he will find favor.\" That our ancient brothers of Egypt were not deficie nt in the masonic virtues of \"B ROTHERLY L OVE AND R ELIEF AND T RUTH ,\" appears from the following: On the tombs we find the common formula: \"I have given bread to the hungry, water to the thirsty, clothes to the naked, shelter to the stran ger.\" This tenderness for suffering humanity is character istic of the nation.

God is thus invoked, \"Rock of truth is thy name.\" In an inscription at Sistrum a king addresses Hathor, goddess of truth, \"I offer to the e the truth, O goddess, for truth is thy work, and thou t hyself art the truth.\" Truthfulness was an essential part of the Egyptian moral code, and in the Egyptian Ritual we are informed that, when after death the soul enters the hall of the Two Truths, or Perfect Justice, it repeats t he words learned upon earth: \"O thou great God, Lord o f Truth, I have known thee, I have known thy name: Lord of Truth is thy name. I never told a lie at th e tribu- nal of truth.\" (\"Religion of the Ancient Egyptians,\" by John Newen - ham Hoare, a late article in the \"Nineteenth Centur y\") But enough had been advanced to establish the fact that the ancient Mysteries originally taught the unity o f God, and also that their moral code was both pure and exalte d. That the ancient Mysteries, after the people became cor- rupt, became corrupt in their turn, there can be no doubt, but in their inception they were not so. The crowning s ecret was a knowledge of the true God, and the disclosure of th e fact that the sun was only a symbol of the great Creator, and not itself a divine being. In the midst of an age where the wors hip of the sun was the established religion of all nations, no one could with safety avow his disbelieve in the divine natur e of the heavenly bodies. To do so would be instant destruct ion. Before the great truth of the real nature and attri butes of God could be communicated, the candidate was requir ed to take all the degrees of the Mysteries, and give the strongest proofs of his fidelity and zeal. A knowledge of the true God was, in the language of the Orphic hymn, \"the secret of secrets\" to be only communicated 31"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy when the aspirant was \"perfectly initiated,\" with \"doors care- fully guarded and the profane excluded!\" It was even then, to those to whom it was to be communicated, \"a solemn and unexpected truth which \"startled their ears\" and \"overturned their preconceived opinions.\" Taught from their earliest infancy to regard the su n, moon, and stars as actual divinities, a wandering in the darkness of a false system religion, they were on their initiatio n into the Mysteries first brought to behold the true light an d there obtained for the first time a knowledge of the true God. This was the real A UTOPSY , \"bringing to light,\" of the candidate in the Mysteries. \"It was difficult,\" says Plato, \"to attest and dan- gerous to publish, the knowledge of the true God. The light thus communicated under the strictest con ditions of secrecy to be kept, when communicated, religious ly hidden from the initiated, it being well known that a publ ic profession of the great truth would be visited by a heavy hand of both the civil and religious authorities, and not only t heir own lives but that of their kindred be thus sacrificed to the superstitious rage of the ignorant multitude, and the interested fury of the ministers of a false religion. It is true that the priests themselves often took a n active part in the Mysteries, of which they had taken the higher degrees. The Mysteries served as a sort of theologi cal and sci- entific seminary, which they studied the truths of religion and science, and from the higher degrees of which the r anks of the priesthood and rulers were from time to time recrui ted. But these facts could be of a help to him who rashly ma de a pub- lic profession of his want of faith in the national sol ar gods. The policy of secrecy, by which all but truth, whet her reli- gious or scientific, was concentrated in and confin ed to the Mysteries, was a \"stated policy\" long established a nd though to be necessary for the well-being of society. It cert ainly was for the well-being of the few on whom it conferred powe r and wealth. To \"reveal the Mysteries\" was considered th e very 32"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. The Ancient Mysteries Described highest of crimes and he who did so could hope for no mercy. The very priests who perhaps had initiated him, and who did not themselves believe in the divinity of the sun, moon, and stars, would be the first to denounce his alleged i mpiety and atheism, and urge on his punishment. Nor would any of the brotherhood help him, as he would be considered by them as a perjured traitor, who had violated the most solem n obliga- tions, and now sought to destroy the order itself b y exposing it to the superstitious wrath of the ignorant multitud e. The betrayers of the Mysteries were punished capita lly and with merciless severity. Diagoras the Melian ha d revealed the Orphic and Eleusinian Mysteries, on wh ich account he passed with the people as an atheist, an d the city of Athens proscribed him and set a price o n his head. The poet AEschylus had like to have been torn in pieces by the people, on the mere suspicion that in one of his scenes he had given a hint of something in t he Mysteries. (Warburton) So long, however, as the initiated held their peace , they all might, at the solemn assemblies of the Mysteries, h eld under circumstances of profound secrecy and sanctioned by the gov- ernment itself, worship the one true God without fe ar; indeed, such a worship was enjoined upon them. But, should they openly disclose their belief in the actual divinity of the sun, moon, and stars, their danger was immediate and the ir ruin certain. Thus all alike, from the most exalted hier ophant to the humblest of the initiated, were the slaves, and som etimes the victims, of a system of state policy which they all upheld and defended. It is true, however, that in the progress of many centuries the Mysteries became corrupt, and lost a knowledge of the true God, but in their original institution they not only taught the truth concerning the Deity, but protecte d his wor- shipers so long as they kept sacred their vows of s ecrecy. That the doctrine of immortality was also directly taugh t in the Mys- teries, we are informed by Cicero, who had himself been initi- ated. (See \"Tusculan Disputations,\" Book I, cxiii.) Among all 33"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy the corruptions which at a later date prevailed, th ere, however, yet remained a \"chosen band,\" who preserved the anc ient teachings of the Mysteries in their purity. They we re obliged for their own protection, however, to render their symbols yet more obscure, and make thicker and draw still close r the veil of allegory about the penetralia of divine truth. From these few and faithful ones the truth was handed down to following generations, and from them all that is great, glori ous, and ancient in modern freemasonry was derived. From those freemasonry received its two great doctr ines of the unity of God and the immortality of man; and, t ogether with those sublime truths, it also received that sy stem of astro- nomical symbols, emblems, and allegories also pecul iar to the Mysteries, which were used, anciently, both to conc eal and to illustrate those great truths. Dr. Mackey, in his \" Symbolism of Freemasonry,\" says that those to seek for an astron omical explanation of the masonic ritual, \"yield all that masonry gained of religious development in past ages\" (page 237). For this broad assertion he gives no reasons whatever, and I can not but think that, had he considered the full impo rt of his words, he never would have made any such remark. Th ere is certainly nothing irreligious or atheistical in the employment of astronomical emblems to describe and illustrate the nature and attributes of Deity. If so, the writers of the Bible have been guilty of a great sin, for that sacred volume is full of solar and astronomical illustrations of the glory and pow er of the creator. (Numb. 24:17; Psalm 19; 84:11; Mal. 4:2; M att. 2:2; 17:2; Judges 5:20; Job 25:5; 38:7; Dan 12:3; Jude 1 3; Rev. 1:16; 10:1, etc.) Freemasonry, says Dr. Mackey, quoting D r. Hem- ming with approval, is a science of morality \"veile d in allegory and illustrated by symbols.\" It is to be inferred t hat the moral science taught in freemasonry is any the less true, pure, or ele- vated, because the allegories and symbols employed to \"veil and illustrate\" it are astronomical in their charac ter? Is it irreli- gious and atheistical to compare the great Creator to the 34"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Chapter 2.

Neither does it follow that those who give the maso nic rit- ual an astronomical and scientific as well as a mor al interpreta- tion, deny to masonry the glorious distinction of h aving been in past ages the depository of a knowledge of the t rue God, and of the immortal nature of man. All that we cont end is, that those great truths were taught not only by allegory and sym- bol, but originally and mainly by astronomical symbol and allegory. The more exalted and holy any doctrine is, the more ele- vated and sublime should be the symbols and emblems to teach and illustrate it. As the being and attributes of God and the immortal ity of the soul are the two most exalted and sublime of al l truths, so are the sun, moon and stars the most glorious and s ublime objects in nature. There are, therefore, a peculiar fitness and beauty in the employment of the latter to symbolica lly and emblematically illustrate the former. \"The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwo rk.\" In this work no attempt will be made to identify th e masonic emblems, traditions, and legends with the M ysteries of any particular nation. All the Mysteries were or iginally astro- nomical in their character, but differed in form an d detail, as they were founded on different modifications of the Egyptian legend of the personified sun-god. Dr. Mackey, in s trange con- tradiction to the words which we have above quoted from page 236 of his \"Symbolism of Freemasonry,\" devotes a whole chapter of that interesting and learned work to pro ve that free- masonry was derived directly from the Grecian Myste ries of Dionysus. He thinks it certain that the Tyrian artificer, Hir am, was a member of the Dionysiac fraternity, and that he, at the 35"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy head of the Tyrian workmen at the time of the build ing of King Solomon's temple, introduced the Dionysiac Mys teries in a modified and purified form among the Hebrews (Cha pter VI). Dr. Oliver, who denies in all its detail the a stronomical theory, with an equal inconsistency advocates the s ame idea. (See his \"Theocratic Philosophy of Freemasonry,\" Le cture VIII.) According to Dr. Mackey, and Dr. Oliver, als o, freema- sonry is therefore only a modified and purified for m of the Grecian Mysteries of Dionysus. It is true that, like the others, these Mysteries b ecame cor- rupt, but is equally true that the Mysteries of Dio nysus, like all the other Mysteries, were astronomical in their cha racter. Dionysus is but another name for Osiris, and is the personified sun-god, the legend of whose death, the search for whose body, and its recovery, together with his subsequen t \"raising\" from death and the grave of a new life, forms the t heme of the ceremony of initiation; all of which the aspirant w as caused to dramatically enact. \"One thing, at least\" says Dr. Mackey, is incapable of refutation; and that is, that we are indebted to the Tyrian masons for the introduction of the symbol of Hiram Abif. The idea of the symbol, though modified by the Jewish masons, is not Jewish in its inception. It was evidently borrowed from the p agan \"Mysteries,\" where Bacchus, Adonis, Proserpine, and a host of other apotheosized beings play the same role that Hiram does in the masonic Mysteries. (\"Symbolism of Freemasonry,\" Chapter I, page 20) This emphatic language of Dr. Mackey, therefore, no t only admits, but declares \"incapable of refutation, \"the following important particulars: 1. That Hiram Abif, as described in the masonic leg end, is a mystical being, or \"symbol\" only, and not a histo rical person, any more than Bacchus, Adonis, or Proserpine. 36"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Chapter 2.

It is simply that of the personified sun—slain like Osiris, Bacchus, Adonis, or Dionysus , at the Autumnal equinox; lying dead during the winter mont hs, being restored to life at the vernal equinox, and e xalted in power and glory at the summer solstice. These admissions of Dr. Mackey cover the whole grou nd, and sanction every position to be taken in this wor k. It is not, however, my intention to trace the masonic traditio ns, legends, and emblems, like Dr. Mackey, to any one of the anc ient Mys- teries to the exclusion of the others, as masonry h as features derived from each of them. It is, however, my design to show that it is of an astronomical nature, and had its origin, in com- mon with all the ancient Mysteries, in a lofty syst em of astro- nomical allegories, originally intended to teach the unity of God, the immortality of the soul, and an exalted co de of morality; while at the same time, by the use of the same alle- gories and symbols, the leading facts of astronomic al science were to be both illustrated and preserved—in other words, to show that freemasonry is a system of science as well as moral - ity, veiled in an astronomical allegory, and illust rated by astro- nomical symbols.

The real character and true origin of the peculiar symbol- ism of freemasonry and its allegories have been a g reat puzzle to most members of the fraternity. The great moral truths which those symbols and allegories teach are plain enough; the only mystery is, how came those truths to be ta ught by those peculiar symbols and in that peculiar manner? It is also worthy of remark that, while the moral t ruths which our emblems, symbols, and legends teach are s till well understood, yet those great scientific truths, whic h are equally said to illustrate and teach, are wholly lost, and at least their connection with them. This lost connection between our emblems, symbols, and legends, and many of the prof oundest truths of science, will be restored in the pages of this work. Oliver and Hutchinson have both, with much labor, a nd the former with great learning, attempted to prove that the master-mason's degree is a Christian institution—no t in the sense of its being pervaded with the spirit of Chri stianity, which is true, but a Christian institution in the s ame sense as the Church or the rite of baptism is. Dr. Mackey co rrectly says they have \"fallen into a great error.\" The theory t hat our frater- nity had its origin in the building societies of th e middle ages is sufficiently disproved by our ritual itself, whi ch has many features that are totally inconsistent with any suc h theory, and point to a far more remote era; although many thing s relating to operative masonry were no doubt then ingrafted o n it. Dr. Mackey, Oliver, and others, will not accept the astro- nomical theory, and thus the whole matter remains, so far as they are concerned, a mystery.

Many masons, like Dr. Oliver, seem to have an illogical and almost superstitious fear of having the astronomical chara cter of our symbolism established. The fact is, however, that t he great moral truths of freemasonry are indestructible, and stand inde- pendent of the symbolism intended to illustrate the m, and to conceal them also, in past ages, when disclosure ex posed the initiated to persecution and death, as an unbelieve r in the actual divinity of the sun, moon and stars. The gre at moral teachings of freemasonry will not suffer any danger of destruc- tion or damage if it is fully established that the emblems by which they are illustrated, like the imagery of the Bible, are mainly astronomical instead of mechanical.

It is now the second, by reason of the precession of the equi noxes, which will be subsequently explained. It is known b y two bright stars, about 4° apart, which are in the horn s of the Ram.

The Pleiades are in Tau- rus, and near it is the magnificent constellation Orion, called Orus by the Egyptians. In that sublime chapter of the Ol d Tes- tament, Job xxxviii, mention is made of these: \"Can st thou bind the sweet influences of the Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?\" Taurus, once seen and recognized in connection with Orion, is never forgotten. The Bull is represented as engaged in combat with Orion, and plunging toward him with threatening horns. The face of the Bull is designated by five bright stars in the shape of a let- ter V, known as the Hyades, the most brilliant of which is Aldebaran, which is much used by navigators. The tips of the horns of the Bull are marked by two bright stars at an appro- priate distance above the face. The Pleiades gleam brightly near the shoulder. Orion, who faces the Bull, is known by four bright stars, forming a large parallelogram, in the center of which is seen a diagonal row of stars, known as the belt of Orion, and called in Job the \"bands of Orion.\" The four st ars of the parallelogram, respectively, indicate his sh oulders and feet.

It once marked the summer solstice , and at the building of King Solomon's temple was much near er that point than now; this change of position, consequent upon the precession of the equinoxes, will be subsequently e xplained, together with the intimate connection between the c onstella- tion Leo and the masonic tradition. In the Hebrew z odiac Leo is the significator of the tribe of Judah. Accordin g to astrology, it is the \"sole house of the sun.\" Virgo This is the beautiful virgin of the zodiac. She is represented as holding a spear of ripe wheat in her left hand, marked by a brilliant star, called Spica. In the Egyptian zodiac Isis supplies the place of Virgo, and is represented holding thre e ears of corn in her hand. Spica, together with Denebola in Leo, and Arcturus in Bootes, forms an equilateral triangle of great beauty. Arcturus is also one of the stars mentioned by Job: \"Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou 45"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy guide Arcturus with his sons?\" Mazzaroth signifies the twelve signs of the Zodiac. Arcturus is also frequently alluded to by Virgil in the first book of the \"Georgics.\" The ris ing and setting of this star were supposed to portend great tempest s. In the time of Virgil it rose about the middle of Septembe r. The bright star Spica, in Virgo, lies within the path of the moon, and is of great use to navigators. In the Hebrew zo diac Virgo is assigned to Naphtali, whose standard was a tree bearing goodly branches. Libra This constellation is anciently represented by the figure of a man or woman holding a pair of scales. The human figure is omitted in all Arabian zodiacs, as it is held unlaw ful by the believers in the Koran to make any representation o f the human form. In our zodiac, also, the balance only i s depicted, probably because we received the zodiac from the Ar abians. This constellation may be distinguished by a quadri lateral of four stars, but it contains none of great brillianc y. In the Hebrew zodiac Libra is ascribed to Asher This constellation formerly was on the autumnal equinox, and when the sun entered its stars the days and nights were equal. T o this the Latin poet Virgil alludes: Libra die somnique pares ubi fecerit horas, Et medium luci atque umbris jam devidit orbem. When Libra makes the hours of day and night equal, and now divides the globe in the middle, between li ght and shades. — \"Georgics,\" Book I Scorpio this constellation has some resemblance, in the gro uping of its stars, to the object after which it is named. I t is a very con- spicuous object in the evening sky of July. In its general form it resembles a boy's bow kite, the tail of which fo rms that of a scorpion, and is composed of ten bright stars. The first of these, near the point of the triangle forming the b ody of the 46"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. A Chapter of Astronomical Facts kite, is Antares. It is a brilliant red star, resembling the planet Mars. In the Hebrew zodiac Scorpio is referred to D an. Sagittarius The Archer follows Scorpio, and is represented as a mon- ster, half horse and half man, in the act of shooti ng an arrow from a bow. Sagittarius is easily recognized by the figure of an inverted dipper, formed of several bright stars. Th e figure of Sagittarius appears in the ancient zodiacs of Egypt and India. Capricornus The Goat is composed of fifty-one visible stars, mo st of them small. It is of no particular importance, exce pt from the connection of its sign with the winter solstice, of which more will be said hereafter. It was called by the ancien t Oriental nations the southern gate of the sun. Aquarius and Pisces These are the last two constellations of the zodiac . The former is represented by the figure of a man, pouri ng out water from a jar, the latter by two fishes joined a t a consider- able distance by a loose cord. Aquarius in the Hebrew zodiac represents the tribe of Reuben, and the Fishes Sime on. The stars in both of these constellations are small and unimportant, except Fomalhaut, in Aquarius, which is almost of the first magnitude, and is used by navigators. This conclude s our description of the constellations of the zodiac. The Signs of the Zodiac The signs of the zodiac are twelve arbitrary signs, or char- acters, by which the twelve constellations are desi gnated. They are as follows: These, without doubt, had their origin in the hiero glyphic or picture writing of the ancients. In the sign Ari es ( ) we have a rude but yet remaining representation of the head and horns of the Ram. In Taurus ( ) of the face and horns of a 47"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy Bull. Gemini ( ) denotes the Twins, seated side by side with embracing arms. The ancient statues of Castor and P ollux con- sisted of two upright pieces of wood, joined togeth er by two cross-pieces. Cancer ( ) yet retains a resemblance to the claws of the Crab. Leo ( ) may be intended for a crouching lion, or may be the outline of its principal stars— the group now called the Sickle, the stars of which, if joine d by an imag- inary line, would form a figure not unlike the sign ( ). In Virgo ( ) the resemblance seems to be lost. Libra ( ) is a plain picture of a scale-beam. The sign Scorpio ( ) displays the sting of a venomous creature. Sagittarius, the Archer, is well represented by his arrow and part of his bow ( ). In Capricornus ( ) the resemblance is again lost; but in Aquar- ius ( ) we recognize the waves of the sea, denoting water . In Pisces ( ) the resemblance of two fishes joined is still app ar- ent. It is quite easy to conceive how the original picto rial repre- sentations of the creatures emblematically denoting the vari- ous constellations of speed and convenience in writ ing them, grew into these arbitrary signs like letters. In the figure of the zodiac, opposite page 42 the p ictorial representations of the twelve constellations are gi ven, with the arbitrary signs denoting each placed against them. The sun, moon, and planets were also designated by hieroglyp hic astro- nomical signs by the ancients, as follows. The planetary signs originated in the same manner a s the zodiacal ones. The sign for the sun is \"a point wit hin a cir- cle\"—the point represents the earth, and the circle the ecliptic. The moon is appropriately pictured as a crescent. I n the sign of Mercury we have the caduceus of that god, composed of 48"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. A Chapter of Astronomical Facts two serpents twisted about a rod. Mars is represent ed by his shield and spear. Venus is well denoted by the pict ure of an ancient hand-mirror. The origin of the planetary si gn for Jupi- ter is not so clear. It does not in the least resem ble an eagle, as some suggest, nor is it any more like the initial l etter of the Greek Zeus; besides, the hieroglyphs are always representa- tions of objects, not letters. This sign resembles more nearly the no less ancient numeral sign, the figure 4, and , as Jupiter is the fourth planet from the sun (if, like the ancien ts, we do not enumerate the earth), this resemblance may not be a ccidental. Saturn, lastly, is represented by his scythe in its ancient form. These arbitrary signs for the planets and constella tions have come down to us from a remote antiquity. Their general use, by all civilized nations is of great benefit, as they form a kind of astronomical shorthand, which, like the Ara bian or Hindoo numerals, is equally well understood in all countries, no matter how much their language or ordinary writt en char- acters may differ, so that astronomical tables for the use of navigators and others are as well understood and as easily read in any one part of the civilized world as anot her. The great convenience of this is so apparent as to requ ire no com- ment. The time when the zodiac was divided into twe lve con- stellations, and the zodiacal signs invented, is lo st in the dim distance of an extreme antiquity. The best opinion at present seems to be that the zodiac was derived from the Hi ndoos by the Egyptians, who gave it to the Arabians, who pre served it, and in turn transmitted it to us. Baldwin, in his \" Prehistoric Nations,\" however proves that it is highly probable that the ancient Arabians originated it in prehistoric times . When the signs of the zodiac first began to be used, or what ancient stu- dents of the starry skies invented them, is therefo re unknown, save by conjecture. The zodiac has four principal points: these are the two sol- stitial and two equinoctial points, which, dividing the circle of the zodiac into four equal parts, are properly desi gnated in the 49"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy foregoing diagram. These four points were anciently marked by the stars Fomalhaut, Aldebaran, Regulus, and Antares. The Solstitial Points The solstitial points refer to the movement of the sun, north of the equator in summer and south of it in w inter. They are the points marking the extreme northern and sou thern lim- its of this movement of the sun. The summer solstice, when the sun comes farthest north, is at present in Cancer, and the winter solstice, or his extreme southern limit, is in Capricor- nus. The distance of the sun north and south of the equa tor is called his northern or southern declination. When the sun reaches either solstitial point, he begins to turn back toward the other—at first very slowly, and for a short per iod seems to stand still. It is for this reason that these point s are called \"sol- stitial,\" from the latin words sol, the sun, and sistere-stiti, to cause to stand. When, in June, the sun enters Cancer, and reaches his greatest northern declination, his rays , falling more vertically, cause the change from winter and spring to summer in all countries north of the equator. This shiftin g of the sun from one solstitial point to the other is the cause of the change of the seasons. The Equinoctial Points These are the points where the sun crosses the cele stial equator, which he necessarily does twice in his yea rly circuit of the zodiac, at two opposite points, distant from each other in space 180°, and in time six months. The point wh ere the sun crosses in spring, coming north, is called the vernal or spring equinox; and the other, where he crosses six months afterward, going south, is called the autumnal equinox. At these periods the days and nights are equal, and th at is the reason why they are called equinoctial points, from two Latin words, aquus, equal, and nox, night. These two points are in the signs Aries ( ) and Libra ( ), and are so marked on the diagram of the zodiac. 30"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. A Chapter of Astronomical Facts The relative positions of the equinoctial and solst itial points and the celestial equator will be better und erstood from the following diagram. Imagine a hoop lying horizon tally, and within this another hoop teaching the first, and wi th one side elevated above the other, as represented in the dia gram: The horizontal hoop, marked A B, is the equator; the other, and around which the signs of the zodiac are displayed, is the ecliptic, or apparent path of the sun. The earth is in the ce nter, with its equator on the same plane with the celesti al equator. The equator of the earth is marked e e. The line f f is on the same plane as the ecliptic. The two other lines, on e above and one below the equator of the earth, and parallel to it, are the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, parallel with the same lines extended in the heavens, and marked as the tropics. DIAGRAM OF THE ECLIPTIC AND EQUATOR The only two points where the circle of the eclipti c and that of the equator can intersect are, of course, o pposite to each other. These are the equinoctial points, marked Aries ( ) and Libra ( ). The solstitial points are those marked and . Now, it is evident that when the sun leaves ( ) Aries, 51"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy or the vernal equinox, his pathway is continually upward, and until he teaches ( ) Cancer, and there attains his highest point north of the celestial equator, as well as th at of the earth (e e). This is the summer solstice. Leaving Cancer the sun begins to decline toward the south, descending thro ugh ( ) Leo and ( ) Virgo until he reaches ( ) Libra, on the 23rd of September, which is the autumnal equinox. From this point the sun continues to descend through ( ) Scorpio and ( ) Sagittarius until the winter solstice is reached, at ( ) Capri- cornus, December 23rd, where the sun has reached his lowest southern declination. He is now just as far south o f the celes- tial equator as he was north of it at the summer solstice. From Capricornus ( ) the sun begins to ascend through ( ) Aquarius and ( ) Pisces until the vernal equinox is again reached. These four cardinal points, the two solsti tial, together with the vernal and autumnal equinox, are therefore indica- tive of the four seasons of the year; for when the sun reaches the vernal equinox, spring begins; when he has advanced to the tropic of Cancer, the summer begins. His arrival at the other equinox marks the advent of autumn; and, when he at last reaches the tropic of Capricorn, winter begins. The Precession of the Equinoxes This is the name that is given to a gradual change of place, which is constantly going on, as to the point where the sun does not cross at the same place each year; on the contrary, each time when the sun completes the circuit of the zodiac, he crosses the equator at a point a small distance back of the place where he did so the previous year—in conseque nce of which the equinoctial point is annually falling bac k at a uni- form rate. If you will refer to the above diagram o f the zodia- cal points, and imagine the circle of the ecliptic being slowly turned around its center toward Cancer ( ), within the circle of the equator, which remains fixed—the contact bet ween the two circles being preserved, and no change made in the angle at which they intersect each other—you will be able to gain a 52"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. A Chapter of Astronomical Facts clear idea of the effect of this phenomenon. The po int marked ( ) Aries would then slowly advance above the equator until the point marked was at the intersection of the two circles. The Fishes ( ) would then be on the equinox, which is now the case. In time, this motion being continued, would occupy that place, and so on. The point where the sun crossed the equator was onc e in the constellation Aries, but in the long progress of centuries the place of the sun's crossing has fallen back 30° from the first degree of that constellation, so that the ver nal equinox is now really in the constellation Pisces, the Fishes; or, in other words, the sun enters the stars of the constellation Pisces on the 21st of March, and not those of the constellation Aries, as it did twenty-two centuries ago, as we are informed by Hippar- chus. The place, however, where the sun crosses the celestial equator has continued to be, and still is, and will continue to be, marked by the sign ( ) Aries, so that the sign of Aries now marks the place in the zodiac of the constellation of the Fishes. The signs and the constellations are therefore no longer in the same place. Hence, in order to make o ur chart of the zodiac (page 42) strictly correct, the sign Aries ( ) should be placed against the constellation Pisces, the sig n against the constellation Gemini, the sign against the constellation Cancer, and so around the entire circle. It was onl y for the sake of simplicity and a greater ease of explanatio n that it was not so represented. When, therefore, it is said in astronomical language that the summer solstice is in Cancer, it is the sign ( ) only which is intended for the sun at that period now really enters the stars of the constellation Gemini . In like man- ner the winter solstice is in the sign , but in the constellation Sagittarius; the autumnal equinox in the sign , but in the constellation Virgo. This precession of the equinoxes is still going on, but the other four cardinal points of the zodiac will alway s continue to be marked by the signs and and and , without 53"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy regard to the constellations which are the sun actually enters at those periods. It is by this means that astronomers are able to register upon the face of the heavens this apparent movement of the stars. This phenomenon is called the precession of the equinoxes, although it is really a falling back of the equinoxes, although it is really a falling back of the equinoc tial point; however, as it causes the stars apparently to advan ce, it has been called a \"precession.\" The rate of this motion has been determined by long -con- tinued observations, and is a little more than fift y and a quar- ter seconds (50 1 / 4 \") of a degree each year. It therefore takes the equinoctial point about 2,140 years to fall bac k an entire sign, or 30°. In 25,791 years it will make a comple te revolution of the whole circle of the zodiac. This period is c alled the G REAT P LATONIC Y EAR , because that philosopher taught that after it had elapsed the world would begin anew. Hipparchus, who made the first catalogue of the sta rs known to us, and who is called the father of astron omy, was the first who observed the motion of the stars. He informs us time, twenty-two centuries ago, the equinoctial poi nt was in the first degree of the constellation Aries. The Hindoo astronomer, Varaha, says the southern so l- stice was certainly once in the middle of Aslcha (Leo); the northern in the first degree of Dhanishta (Aquar- ius). Since that time the solstitial as well as the equinoc- tial points have gone backward on the ecliptic 75°. This divided by 50 1 / 4 \", gives 5,373 years. Sir W. Jones says that Varaha lived when the solstices were in the fi rst degrees of Cancer and Capricorn, or about four hun- dred years before Christ. (Burritt) A brief description of the yearly progress of the s un will help much to the understanding of subsequent portio ns of this work.

On the 21st of June the summer solstic e is reached, the summer begins. This is the longest day in the year, and the sun then attains his greatest brillia ncy and dis- penses the most light. All through the summer month s his heat and power are at the greatest, but as he approaches the sign ( ) Libra, at the autumnal equinox, the days graduall y shorten, and as he leaves Libra they grow dark and short with great rapidity. In October and November the sun ent ers the signs Scorpio and Sagittarius ( and ), and the cold and stormy winds begin to herald the approach of winter . The sun daily loses power, his rays grow rapidly more feebl e and pallid until Capricorn ( ) is reached at the winter solstice. At this period occurs the shortest day of the year, and fro m that time forward the sun seems to lie dead in the cold embra ce of win- ter, until, again approaching Aries ( ) and the vernal equi- nox, he begins to show symptoms of returning life. When Aries ( ) is reached, the sun begins to again manifest his power. The snow and ice melt away beneath his reviv ing rays, and vegetation begins to show itself. After the vernal equinox the sun rapidly regains hi s vitality, and all nature with him springs from the torpidity and death of winter. The earth and the heavens, clothed once mor e in light and beauty, rejoice in a new life. It was this succ ession of phe- nomena, marking the yearly progress of the sun in t he zodiac, that led the ancients, in their poetical and allego rical language, to represent the sun as being slain in the autumn a nd winter, and being restored to life again in the spring and summer.

Rawlinson, speaking of the Chaldeans, says, We are formed by Simplicius that Callisthenes, who accompanied Alexander to Babylon, sent to Aristotle from that capital a series of astro- nomical observations, which he had found pre- served there, extending back to a period of 1,903 years before Alexander's conquest of that city, or 2234 B.C. This would be over four thousand years ago. Ideler, quoted and endorsed by Humboldt, says, 57"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy The Chaldeans knew the mean motions of the moon with an exactness which induced the Greek astrono- mers to use their calculations for the foundations of a lunar theory. Ptolemy, also, used Chaldean observations which ext ended back 721 B.C. Diodorus Siculus says the Chaldeans a ttributed comets to natural causes, and could fortell their r eappearance. He states that their recorded observations of the p lanets were very ancient and very exact. According to Seneca, t heir theory of comets was quite as intelligent and correct as t hat of the moderns. He says they classed them with the planets , or moving stars, that had fixed orbits. (Baldwin's \"Pr ehistoric Nations.\") The Egyptians also made great progress in astronomy , geometry, and other sciences in the time that prece ded the accession of Menes, their first king, which takes u s back to a period now over five thousand years ago. (Wilkinson 's \"Ancient Egyptians.\") Herodotus informs us (Book II , Chapter IV) that the Egyptians \"were the first to discover the solar year, and to portion out its course into twelve parts.\" T hey \"obtained this knowledge,\" he says, \"from the stars .\" The Egyptians were inventors of what we call \"leap year ,\" for they made every fourth year to consist of three hundred and sixty- six days, so as to correct and keep the calendar in order. This must have been done at least 1322 B.C., according t o Wilkin- son. Caesar was indebted to an Egyptian astronomer, Sosi- genes, for his famous correction of the calendar. P lato ascribes the invention of geometry likewise to the Egyptians . Hero- dotus also says, \"Geometry first came to be known i n Egypt, whence it passed into Greece\" (Book II, Chapter CIX ). The Egyptians knew the true system of the universe. The y were acquainted with the fact that the sun is the center of the solar system, and that the earth and other planets revolv e about it, in fixed orbits. They knew that the earth is of a g lobular shape, and revolves on its own axis, thus producing day and 58"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Chapter 4. What the Ancients Knew about Astronomy night. They also knew of the revolution of the moon about the earth, and that the moon shines by the reflected li ght of the sun. They understood the calculation of eclipses; t hey were aware of the obliquity of the ecliptic, and that th e milky-way is a collection of stars. They also seem to have under stood the power of gravitation, and that the heavenly bod ies are attracted to a center. (Rawlinson's \"Herodotus,\" Ap pendix to Chapter VII, Book II, and authorities there quoted. ) Pythago- ras, who introduced the true system of the universe into Greece, received it from Oenuphis, a priest of On, in Egypt. This great proficiency alone in astronomy would mak e it a matter of certainty that the ancients possessed the telescope, long supposed to be one of the grandest inventions of modern times, as the discovery of many of these astronomic al facts, known to the Chaldeans and Egyptians, would simply be impossible without it. A knowledge of the heliocent ric system, long lost, and only rediscovered by Copernicus, was not con- sidered actually demonstrated or credited by the mo derns until the rediscovery of the telescope, which revealed th e phases of Venus, and so put the matter beyond doubt. We, h owever, are not left to conjecture only on this point, for there is some positive testimony that the ancients possessed the telescope. I quote again from Baldwin's \"Prehistoric Nations\": Much progress in astronomy requires the telescope, or something equivalent, and it seems necessary to bel ieve that the ancients had such aids to eyesight. Layard and others report the discovery of a lens of considerable power among the ruins of Babylon. Layard says this lens was found with two glass bowls in a chamber of ruins called Nimroud. It is plano-convex, an inch a nd a half in diameter, and nine tenths of an inch thick. It gives a focus of four and a half inches from the pl ane side. Sir David Brewster says, \"It was intended to be used as a lens, either for magnifying or condensing the rays of the sun.\" (See Layard's Nineveh and Babylon,\" pp. 16 -17, Chapter VIII) 59"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy This settles the fact that the ancients at a very r emote period were familiar with all those laws of optics a knowl edge of which is required to invent the telescope, and also with the manufacture of glass, so necessary for lenses desig ned for tele- scopic uses. That the art of making glass was known to the ancients—a fact once doubted—is proved also by disc overies in Egypt, where the whole process of blowing glass has been found depicted on the ancient monuments. So great w as the skill of the ancient Egyptians in making vases of v arious col- ored glass, that our best European workmen of moder n times cannot equal them. Glass was also one of the great exports of the Phoenicians. The Egyptians, however, surpassed all others, and some vases of brilliant colors, presented by an Egyptian priest to the Emperor Hadrian, were considered so v aluable and curious that they were never used except on gra nd occa- sions. Some of the details of Egyptian glass in mos aic work (by a process common with that people more than three t housand years ago), such as the feathers of birds, so find as to be only made out with a lens, which means of magnifying must there- fore have been known in Egypt at the remote period when this mosaic glasswork was made. This shows us that the use of the lens was not confined to Assyria at an early epoch, nor yet was a recent discovery there. (Wilkinson's \"Ancient Egyp- tians\") Mr. Baldwin, in his work, continues as follows: Even the Greeks and Romans, with lower attainments in astronomy, had aids to eyesight. They are mentioned in \"De Placitus Phil.,\" lib. iii, c. v, attributed to Plutarch, also in his \"Vita Marcelli,\" and by Pliny, \"Hist. N atur.,\" lib. xxxvii, c. v, where he says that, in his time, artificers used emeralds, to assist the eye, and that they wer e concave, the better to collect the visual rays. He adds that Nero used such glasses when he watched the fights of the gladiators. 60"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Chapter 4. What the Ancients Knew about Astronomy There is frequent mention of concave and convex glasses used for optical purposes, and they evident ly came from Egypt and the East. Iamblichus tells us, in his life of Pythagoras, that Pythagoras sought to c ontrive instruments that should aid hearing as effectively as optic glasses and other contrivances aided sight. P lu- tarch speaks of mathematical instruments used by Archimedes \"to manifest to the eye the largeness of the sun.\" Pythagoras and Archimedes both studied in Egy pt and Phoenicia, and probably in Chaldea. Pythagoras, who lived in the sixth century before Christ, is sa id to have \"visited Egypt and many countries of the East\" in pursuit of knowledge; and Archimedes, who lived aft er the time of Alexander, spent much time in Egypt, \"a nd visited many other countries.\" It appears that, in the time of Pythagoras, \"optic glasses,\" contrived to increase the power of vision, were so com- mon as not to be regarded as objects of curiosity, and there can be no reasonable doubts that they were fi rst invented by the great men who created that profound science of astronomy for which people of Cushite origin were everywhere so preeminently distinguished, and which was so intimately connected with religion. (Bald- win's \"Prehistoric Nations,\" pp. 178-179) The authorities above quoted, and the consideration s advanced, render it certain that the ancients not o nly pos- sessed the telescope, or its full equivalent, but a lso had attained a proficiency in astronomy abundantly suff icient for them to have originated the philosophical astronomi cal allego- ries ascribed to them in the course of this work.

Because the sun rises in the east to open and govern the day, and sets in the west to close the labors of the same; while the sun in the south admonishes the weary workman of his midday meal, and calls him from labor to refreshmen t. Dr. Oliver informs us, in his dictionary, that the pedestal, with the volume of the sacred laws, i s placed in the eastern part of the lodge, to signify that as the sun rises in the east, to open and enliven the day, so is the Worshipful Master placed in the east to o pen the lodge, and to employ and instruct the brethren in masonry. (See article \"East\") Gadicke, another masonic writer, says, \"The sun ris es in the east, and in the east is the place for the Worshipful Master\"; and, finally, Dr. Hemming, speaking of the three pr incipal officers of the lodge, says: The Sun rises in the east to open the day, and dispenses life and nourishment to the whole creation. This is well represented by the Worshipful Master, who is placed in the east to open the lodge, and who imparts light, knowledge, and instruction to all under his directi on.

In what direction are masons instructed to trave l? A. Toward the east, in search of light. Q. Why so? A. Because the sun rises in the east, and is the gr eat source of light. Masonic Words and Names Q. What does the word of an E. A. M. signify? A. It has more than one collateral meaning, pronoun ced or written either forward or backward, but if divided into the rad- icals of which it is composed it will be found to s ignify the Fire-God or Quickening Fire —i.e., the sun. Q. What does the word F. C. M. signify? A. This word, if divided into its radicals, means t he moon. 67"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy Q. What does the word of a M. M. signify? A. The roots of which it is composed signify the Be nevolent God of Fire—i.e., the sun; and, as it was by the ai d of fire that metals were first brought into a state fit for the use of man, this divinity was named Vulcan by the Romans, and worshi pped by them. Q. What does the name of O. G. M. H. A. signify? A. It is derived from two roots, which signify the origin or manifestation of light; also he who was and is. Q. What, then, does the whole name signify? A. The source of eternal light—i.e., the sun—taken as an emblem of Deity. Q. Whom, therefore, does O. G. M. H. A. represent. A. The great source of light—the sun. The Royal Arch Q. What is the Royal Arch? A. It may be defined in nearly the same words as th e lodge, and is no less than the starry vault of heaven, or great zodiacal arch, reaching from the vernal to autumnal equinox. Q. How is the Royal Arch supported? A. By three of the cardinal points of the zodiac: b eing the equinoctial points at the base and solstitial point at the sum- mit. Q. Of what are these three points emblematic? A. Like the three pillars of the lodge, they are em blematic of W ISDOM , S TRENGTH , AND B EAUTY .

Why are the three great zodiacal points which su pport the Royal Arch of heaven also emblematic of wisdom, strength, and beauty? A. At the time of the building of King Solomon's te mple, or about 1004 B.C., the celestial equator cut the ecli ptic at about 10° of the constellation Aries. At that period the constellation Leo was therefore near the solstitial point, and su mmit of the zodiacal arch. Now, as the lion is the strongest of beasts, and because the summit or key of an arch is its stronge st point, and the sun, when he reaches that point, has the gr eatest glory and power, it being the summer solstice, when the d ay is the longest—that point is emblematic of strength. The vernal equi- nox signifies beauty, because it marks the opening of spring, which is the season of beauty, and adorns both the heavens with light and the earth with flowers. The autumnal equinox denotes wisdom, because it is the season of maturity. Near that point is also seen the constellation of the Serpent , in all ages 69 Chapter 5.

Q. How may the truth and beauty of this be more str ongly impressed upon the mind? A. By contemplating the Royal Arch itself as it act ually appears in the heavens. Q. What is required in order to be able to do so? A. A sufficient knowledge of the constellations and a favor- able time of observation. Q. What is the most favorable time to observe the R oyal Arch? A. If we wish to observe the constellations as they were at the summer solstice at the time of the building of King Solomon's temple, we should view the heavens about the 1st of August, but as the sun in the south at high twelve, by its overpowering light, prevents the proper stars being seen, it wil l be necessary to defer our observations for six months, or until about the 5th of February, at which time the same stars are visib le at mid- night. \"Low twelve,\" about the 5th of February, is, theref ore, the best time to view the Royal Arch. If we then take our station, looking south, and lif t our eyes to the vast arch of heaven, the spectacle will be o ne of unsur- passed magnificence, and to an intelligent mason el oquent with the truths of his profession. Far up the blue concave, and within less than 30° of the summit of the arch, wil l be seen the constellation Leo, typical of S TRENGTH ; on either side will be seen the constellations Aries and Libra, which anciently marked the equinoctial points, and upon which the w hole majestic arch seems to rest. Libra, the Balance, is typical of what W ISDOM which, in the scales of Reason, duly weighs and considers all thi ngs; while Aries, marking the ancient place of the vernal equinox, is typi- cal of B EAUTY , and also gives a sure token that the sun, which lies dead in the cold arms of Night and Winter, wil l arise again 70"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Chapter 5.

The vernal equinox, or sign Aries, is therefore also the symbol of immor- tality, and teaches that the soul of man will rise in glory from the darkness of the grave.

In the east, in close proximity to Libra, stands th e beautiful virgin of the zodiac, the constellation Virgo. In her left hand gleams the bright star Spica, while not far away toward the north Arcturus shines in splendor. In the west Taurus is seen with the Pleiades.

(See Wilkinson's \"Egyptians of the Time of the Pharaohs,\" p. 137.) King Solomon's Temple Q. Of what was King Solomon's temple emblematic? A. That temple not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Q. Has the word \"temple\" any meaning significant of this? A. All ancient temples were originally dedicated to the wor- ship of the sun and the summer celestial orbs, whos e circuit in the heavens each year was emblematic represented in the details of their construction and ornaments. The wo rd \"tem- ple\" is from tempus, time; templum comes from tempus, and the word \"temple\" is therefore synonymous with tempus, time, or the year. Q. By whom is time—i.e., the temple—each year beaut ified and adorned? A. By the sun, who, from March to October, is conti nually engaged in beautifying the heavens and the earth. Q. When the building of the temple commenced? A. On the 2nd day of Zif, or about the 21st of April. Q. When was the temple finished? A. On the 4th day of Bul, or about the 21st of October . Q. Have those dates any astronomical significance? A. They have. On the 21st of April the sun enters Taurus, and the plowing and planting begin. On the 21st of Octo ber the sun enters Scorpio; \"the summer is over and the harvest is 72"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. Masonic Astronomy finished.\" It was, therefore, that the sun, in his passage through the seven signs (typical of years), from Aries to Scor- pio, was said, emblematically, to raise the Royal A rch, beautify and adorn the heavens, and bring forth the bountifu l fruits of the earth. Q. Is it, therefore, to be understood that the whol e account of the building of King Solomon's temple, as given in the masonic tradition, is an astronomical myth? A. By no means, for there is no fact more certain t han the building of King Solomon's temple, as both sacred a nd pro- fane history testify. It is nevertheless true that the masonic tra- dition respecting it is one of mystical import. It contains within itself not only the history in part of the building of an actual earthly and material temple, but also an emblematic descrip- tion of the heavens and the earth, as well as of th e particulars of the annual passage of the sun among the twelve s igns of the zodiac. There is also good reason for believing the temple itself was expressly built, so as to be in its vari ous parts emblematic of the whole order of nature. Josephus (most learned of Jews) directly informs us that the tabernacle, which was a prototype of the temple, was thus emblematic in its construction. He says, speaking o f the taber- nacle and vestments of the high-priest, that, if anyone, without prejudice and with judgment, loo k upon these things, he will find they were every one made in way of imitation and representation of the uni- verse. When Moses distinguished the tabernacle into three parts, and allowed two of them to the priests , as a place accessible and common, he denoted the land an d the sea, these being of general access to all; but he set apart the third division for God, because heaven is inac- cessible to men. And when he ordered twelve loaves to be set upon the table, he denoted the year as disti n- guished into so many months. By branching out the candlestick into seventy parts, he secretly intimat ed the Decani, or seventy divisions of the planets; and as to 73"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy the seven lamps upon the candlesticks, they referre d to the course of the planets, of which that is the num ber. The veils, too, which were composed of four things, they declare the four elements; for the fine linen was proper to signify the earth, because the flax grows out of the earth. The purple signifies the sea, because that color is dyed by the blood of a sea shellfish; the blue is fit to signify the air, and the scarlet will natura lly be an indication of fire. Now, the vestment of the high p riest, being made of linen, signified the earth; the blue denotes the sky, being like lightening in its pomeg ran- ates, and in the noise of the bells resembling thun der. And for the ephod, it showed that God had made the universe of four (elements); and as for the gold in ter- woven, I suppose it related to the splendor, by whi ch all things are enlightened. He also appointed the b reast- plate to be placed in the middle of the ephod to re sem- ble the earth, for that was the very middle place o f the world. And the girdle which encompassed the high priest round signified the ocean, for that goes rou nd about, and includes the universe. Each of the sard- onyxes declares to us the sun and moon—those, I mean, which were in the nature of buttons on the hi gh priest's shoulders. And as for the twelve stones, whether we understand by them the months, or whether we understand the like number of the signs of that circle which the Greeks call the zodiac, we sh all not be mistaken in their meaning. As for the mitre, which was of blue color, it seems to me it means heaven, for how otherwise could the name of God be inscribed upon it? That it was also illustrated wit h a crown, and that of gold also, is because of that sp lendor with which God is pleased. Let this explanation suf fice at present. (\"Antiquities,\" Book III, Chapter VII, 7) The concluding sentence of this quotation conveys a clear intimation that many other emblematic particulars i n the con- struction of the tabernacle might be pointed out. N ow, as the \"holy place,\" and veils, candlesticks, lamps, vestm ents, and other particulars of the tabernacle were specifical ly repro- duced in the temple, we may safely conclude that th e temple 74"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. Masonic Astronomy itself was so built as to be also emblematic, in it s several parts, of the universe. Nor when we reflect that the desig ns for the temple, as well as the tabernacle, are said to have been given by God himself, need we be surprised at this, for w hat more reasonable than to suppose that, when the great Cre ator of all things revealed the designs for a temple to be dedi cated to himself, it should thus be made in all its parts em blematic of the sum of all his other works—the entire universe? The lodge, according to all masonic writers, is emblematic of King Solo- mon's temple; it is therefore easy to see why it is also emblem- atic of the heavens and the earth. It could not be the one with- out being also the other. It also naturally follows that the masonic tradition is thus possessed for a threefold character: 1. It is in part an actual history of the building of King Solomon's temple. 2. It is an emblematic description of the heavens and the earth. 3. By a system of allegorical and astronomical symbols it is the depository of a high code of morals. In its triune aspect it is, therefore, HISTORICAL , SCIENTIFIC and MORAL . In it the two accounts of the building of the actua l and the mystical temple, the earthly and the heavenly o ne, are curiously interwoven and permeate each other. Yet, the astro- nomical key being given, they may be separated, and each contemplated by itself. Hiram Abif In them Hiram Abif appears both as an authentic and a mystical personage, he is not only the cunning craf tsman employed by King Solomon to beautify and adorn the actual temple, but also an emblematic being, representing the sun, who, by his magnetic power, raises the Royal Arch o f heaven, and beautifies and adorns the terrestrial and celes tial spheres, for which reason his name has a twofold meaning, si gnificant of both characters. 75"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy It is also true that to some extent the life and co nduct of the real personage is emblematic of the mystical on e, yet they differ in several important particulars: 1. The mystical Hiram is represented in the masonic tradi- tion as being an architect, superintending the buil ding and drawing out the plans for the temple. The real Hiram, as mention in history, was, according to the Bible, and also Josephus, no architect at all, and drew out none of the designs for the temple. 2. The mystical Hiram, according to masonic tradition, is represented as having lost his life suddenly before the comple- tion of the temple, in the midst of his labors, and with many of his designs unfinished. On the contrary, the historical Hiram, as we are expressly informed in the sacred Scriptures, lived to finish all his labors in and about the temple, and for King Solomon. For the benefit of unmasonic readers, we will give the sub- stance of the masonic tradition relating to Hiram A biff, which is taken word for word from Dr. Oliver's Dictionary of Symbol- ical Masonry, a work authorized by the highest masonic bod- ies in England and America. Says Dr. Oliver: We have an old tradition delivered down, orally, th at it was the duty of Hiram Abiff to superintend the work - men, and that the reports of the officers were alwa ys examined with the most scrupulous exactness. At the opening of the day, when the sun was rising in the east, it was his constant custom, before the commencement of labor, to enter the temple and offer up his pray ers to Jehovah for a blessing on the work. And in like man ner, when the sun set in the west and the labors of the day were closed, and the workmen had departed, he returned his thanks to the Great Architect of the u ni- verse for the harmonious protection of the day. Not content with this devout expression of his feelings , morning and evening, he always went into the temple at the hour of high twelve, when the men were calle d 76"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. Masonic Astronomy from labor to refreshment, to inspect the progress of the work, to draw fresh designs upon the tracing-board, if such were necessary, and to perform other scientifi c labors, not forgetting to consecrate his duties by solemn prayer. These religious customs were faithfully per - formed for the first six years in the secret recess es of his lodge, and for the last year in the precincts of th e most holy place. At length, on the very day appointed fo r cel- ebrating the cap-stone of the building, he retired as usual, according to our tradition, at the hour of h igh twelve, and did not return alive. (See article \"High Twelve\") Some further particulars of the masonic legend are given in the same book, under the article \"Burial-Place.\" \"The burial-place,\" says Dr. Oliver, of a master mason, is under the Holy of Holies, wit h the following legend delineated on the monument: A virg in weeping over a broken column, with a book open before her. In her right hand a sprig of cassia, in her left an urn. Time standing behind her with his hands enfolded in the ringlets of her hair. The weeping v irgin denotes the unfinished state of the temple; the bro ken column, that one of the principal supporters of mas onry (H. A. B.) had fallen; the open book implies that h is memory is recorded in every mason's heart; the spri g of cassia refers to the discovery of his remains; and the urn shows that his ashes have been carefully collec ted; and Time, standing behind her, implies that time, patients, and perseverance will accomplish all thin gs. Dr. Oliver also, in his ninth lecture, on the \"Theo cratic Philosophy of Freemasonry,\" speaking of Hiram Abif, says: The legend of his death it will be unnecessary to r epeat, but there are some circumstances connected with it which may be interesting. His illustrious consort, whose memory is dear to every true mason, was so sincerel y attached to him that, at his death, she became inco nsol- able, and, refusing to be comforted, she spent the greater part of her time in lamentation and mournin g 77"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy over the tomb which contained his venerated ashes. The monument erected to his memory was particularly splendid, having been curiously constructed of blac k and white marble, from plans furnished by the Grand Warden, on the purest masonic principles, and occu- pied an honorable situation in the private garden belonging to the royal palace. The foregoing authorized publication of the main fa cts of the masonic legend respecting the death of Hiram Ab iff, con- tains all the particulars necessary for the illustr ation of our sub- ject to unmasonic readers. To members of the frater nity, all the details of the tragic tradition are of course famil iar, and many things designedly made obscure to all others will b e clear to them. The masonic tradition respecting Hiram, it will thu s be seen, speaks of him as being the chief architect of the temple, superintending the workmen and drawing out designs for the construction of the temple. The historical Hiram, mentioned in the Bible and by Jose- phus, is a different personage from the traditional one. That Hiram, who was actually sent to King Solomon, had n othing to do with furnishing the designs of the temple. We ar e expressly informed that the designs, form, and dimensions of the temple were all given by divine command (2 Chronicles 3). To have altered or modified them in the smallest particular would therefore have been a sin, which would have called down the instant and terrible displeasure and punishment of Jehovah. Hiram is nowhere mentioned or described in the Bibl e as being an architect, or even a builder. In 1 Kings 7 :14, he is described as being \"filled with wisdom, and underst anding and cunning to work all works in brass!\" In 2 Chronicles 2:14, the father of Hiram is described as skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving. 78"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. Masonic Astronomy From this it is evident that the father of Hiram, w ho was a man of Tyre, was by profession a decorative artist and sculpture. It is probable that Hiram followed the profession of h is father, according to the custom of the times, otherwise Hir am, King of Tyre, would not have thus particularly spoken of th e profes- sion of his father in describing the accomplishment s of Hiram Abiff himself. King Hiram speaks of Hiram Abiff sim ply as \"a cunning man, endued with understanding\" (verse 13). Jose- phus also mentions Hiram, and uses the following la nguage respecting him: This man was skillful in all sorts of work, but his chief skill lay in working in gold, silver and brass, by whom were made all the mechanical works about the temple, according to the will of Solomon. (\"Antiquities,\" Book VIII, Chapter III, 4) Not a word about his having anything to do with the build- ing of the temple itself. But, as if to put this qu estion of the temple itself. But, as if to put this question to r est, not only Josephus, but the Bible also, mentions just what th ese \"mechanical works\" were. In 1 Kings 7, is a complet e list and description of them, and of all the works done abou t the tem- ple and for its use by Hiram. This list of the work s of Hiram is also given in 2 Chronicles 4:11-19. The same list i s also given by Josephus. From these authorities we learn that H iram made for King Solomon— The two pillars of brass, called fachin and Boaz, t ogether with their ornaments. The molten sea of brass, with twelve oxen under it; a work of great artistic beauty, but calling for the geniu s of a Benve- nuto Cellini, rather than of a Sir Christopher Wren . Also, ten brazen lavers and their bases, and many pots, shovels, flesh-hooks, and other altar-furniture, to be used in and about the sacrifices. All of the foregoing articles were made of bright b rass, and they were cast in clay molds, in the plains of Jord an, between 79"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy Succoth and Zaredathah (2 Chronicles 4; 1 Kings 7:45-46). Succoth means \"booths,\" and was so named because Jacob built him a house there, and \"made booths for his c attle\" (Gen. 33:17). It is fifty miles, at least, in an airline, north by east of Jerusalem, beyond Jordan, between Peniel, near the ford of the torrent Jabbok and Shechem; while Zaredathah, or Zarthan, as it is called in Kings, is still farther north th an Suc- coth. The words \" between Succoth and Zaredathah,\" therefore, denotes that the place where the brass foundries we re situated and these castings were made, was yet farther from Jerusalem than Succoth. The modern name of the torrent Jabbok is Wady Zurka. (See Smith's Dictionary of the Bible, and maps of the Holy Land at the time of David and Christ.) As the distance in an airline from Jerusalem to Succoth was at least fifty miles, it is to be presumed that the distance by the traveled route was considerably more. It may be said that the clay only was procured at this distant pla ce (distant when we consider the slow means of travel in those days), and that it was brought to Jerusalem, to be there u sed by the artist in making the molds for his castings. But th e sacred text expressly says that the casting was done on the spo t. The scene of the labors of Hiram must, therefore, h ave been considerably over fifty miles from Jerusalem, or more than two days' journey, at the smallest calculation ; twenty miles being an ordinary day's journey in those time s and that country. Smith, in his Bible Dictionary, says fifteen. Besides this, the making of the molds and patterns for them would require the personal attention if not la bor of Hiram himself. The casting of large pieces, such as were required for the brazen sea, the lavers and their b ases, and the pillars Jachin and Boaz, which were eighteen cubits , or about thirty-two feet in height, must have demanded his c onstant care and watchful attention, (see Cellini's account of the cast- ing of his bronze Perseus, \"Memoirs,\" vol. ii, c. x li.) These facts, taken in connection with the great number of different 80"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. Masonic Astronomy pieces of work, render it evident that Hiram must h ave been kept the greater part of his time at the distant sc ene of his labors, where the clay required could alone be foun d. It is impossible, under the circumstances, that he could have vis- ited the temple in Jerusalem, from fifty to sixty m iles distant, three times a day, or even once a day, during the s even years that the temple was being built. Besides these works in brass, we are told that Hira m made for Solomon of pure gold ten candlesticks for the oracle, with flowers, lamps, and tongs; also bowls, snuffers, basins, and censors, and hinges of gold, for the holy place and for the doors of the temple. All this work, it will be seen , is that of a \"cunning worker in metals\" and a decorative artist, none of it that of an architect or builder. The other decorative works done in and on the templ e proper, consisting of carvings on the walls of figu res of cheru- bim and palm-trees, also the golden cherubim which were set up in the holy place, are not any of them including in the list of the works of Hiram, nor, indeed, named in the sa me chapter. The mystical Hiram of the masonic tradition, we are also told, met with a sudden death, the particulars of w hich are known to all members of the fraternity, before the completion of the temple. Had any such accident befallen the a ctual Hiram (leading, as we are told, to the suicide, fro m grief, of his wife), certainly the impotence of the tragic event, and the con- sequent delay and confusion it would naturally caus e, would have led to its being recorded either in Kings or C hronicles, or both of them, but no such occurrence is anywhere me ntioned in the sacred narrative, which, respecting the buil ding and dedication of the temple, is particular and minute; nor does Josephus mention any such event. This negative test imony is almost conclusive, but we are not left to rely on t hat alone, for both in Kings and Chronicles we are directly inform ed that the historical Hiram, unlike the mystical one of the masonic tradi- tion, lived to finish all his labors. We read in 2 Chronicles 4, 81"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy \"So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he had made King Solomon for the house of the Lord.\" After the temple was finished we are told that Solo mon built him a house for himself, which was, like the temple, splendidly ornamented by decorations and carvings i n gold, silver, and wood. Mention is also made in Chronicle s of a magnificent ivory throne, surrounded by carved figu res or stat- utes of lions. The building and ornamentation of th is house occupied thirteen years after the temple was finished (1 Kings 7:1). Now if Hiram was also employed by the king to decorate his own house, he must have lived at least thirteen years after the completion of the temple. That Hiram was also e mployed about the \"kings house\" is almost a certainty; for, although the list of his works, as given, makes no mention of th e ivory throne, the lions, or any work done for the \"king's house,\" yet as that list professes to be a list only of the wor k done by Hiram for the temple (see verse 40, also 2 Chronicl es 4:11), we have no right to expect to find it including any of the other work of the artist done for the place of Solomon. T he four- teenth verse of the seventh chapter of 1 Kings dire ctly says that Hiram \"wrought all of King Solomon's work.\" Be sides this, the seven years occupied in building the temple and the thir- teen in building the king's house make up the whole twenty years of the contract which Solomon had with the King of Tyre for materials and skilled workmen, the principal among whom was Hiram, the great artist and sculptor; and it becomes an almost conclusive presumption that Solomon kept him and the other skilled workmen the whole twenty years du ring which he required their aid. As to the nature of this contract of King Solomon's with Hiram, King of Tyre, see 1 Kings 5; 2 Chronicles 2; as to its duration being twenty years, see 1 Kings 9:10; and Josephus on both points.

It is also just as clearly proved by history, both sacred and profane, that he the chief architect of, and furnis hed no designs for, the temple.

If, then, the historical Hiram was no archi- tect, but a decorative artist and sculptor only, an d was not called upon to suffer a sudden death before the com pletion of the temple, it follows, therefore, that it is the mystical Hiram— representing the sun—who meets with that sad fate u nder the completion of the emblematic temple, and not the re al one. The claim that the masonic tradition is historicall y true in all respects cannot be maintained, as it is in most of its main fea- tures in direct conflict with holy writ.

The summer sun, glowing with light and heat as he reaches the autumnal equinox, enters Libra on the 21st of Sep- tember. All through that month, and until the 21st of October, he declines in light and heat, but emerges from Libra ( ) without any serious harm from the attack of Septemb er. The assault of October is far more serious; and the sun when he leaves the venomous sign of the Scorpion ( ), on the 21st of November, is deprived of the greater part of his po wer and shorn of more than half his glory. He continues his way toward the southern tropic, and in November encount ers the deadly dart of Sagittarius ( ), which proves fatal; for when the sun leaves the third autumnal sign, on the 23rd of Decem- ber, he lies dead at the winter solstice. Q. Why is the third attack, or that the November, s aid to be more fatal than that of September or October? A. Because when the sun emerges from under the domi nion of Sagittarius, the ruling sign of November, on the 23rd of December, he enters Capricorn, and reaches his lowest decli- nation. That is the shortest day of the year. In June, at the summer solstice, the bright and glo rious days were over fifteen hours long. Now the pale sun rises above the gloomy horizon of December but a little m ore than half as long, and his feeble rays can hardly penetr ate the dark and stormy clouds that obscure the sky. The sun now seems to be quite overcome by \"the sharpness of the winte r of death.\" Amid the universal mortality that reigns in the vegeta- ble kingdom, the sun, deprived of light, heat, and power, appears dead also. Q. Does the ancient art of astrology throw any further light upon this subject? A. This science was much cultivated by the ancients under the name of the \"divine art.\" According to the teac hings of 85"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy astrology, Capricorn was the \"house of Saturn,\" the most evil and wicked in his influence of all the planets. He is called the \"great infortune,\" and all that part of the zodiac within the signs of Capricornus and Aquarius was under his dom inion. Saturn was also known as Kronos, or Time, which destroys all things; and, in the poetical and allegorical langua ge of mythol- ogy, devours even his own children. The figure of S aturn with his scythe is to this day an emblem of decay and de ath. The sun, therefore, when he entered Capricorn, passed i nto the house and under the dominion of Saturn, or Death. Q. After the sun is slain, what in allegorical lang uage, is said to become of the body? A. It is carried a westerly course, at night, by th e three wintry signs. Q. Why so? A. Because, as the sun continues his course in the zodiac, he appears to be carried west by the wintry signs. Thi s seems to be done at night, because the sun then being invisi ble, his change of position is only discovered by the stars which pre- cede his rise at daybreak. Q. What disposition is finally made of the body? A. As it seemingly buried beneath the withered frui ts and flowers—the \"rubbish\" of the dead vegetation of sum mer—in the midst of which, however, yet blooms the hardy evergreen, emblematic of the vernal equinox, giving a sure tok en that the sun will yet arise from the cold embrace of winter and regain all his former power and glory. Q. What follows? A.

It was somewhere among the twelve constellations that the lost sun was certainly to b e found. Q. By whom was the body found? A. By Aries ( ), one of the three western signs, typical of those who pursued a westerly course.

By the vernal signs Taurus ( ) and Gemini ( ), and the first summer one, Cancer ( ), aided by the second one, Leo ( ); or, in other words, by April, May, and June, aid ed by July. Q. Explain this more fully. A. When the sun arrives at the vernal equinox, he first gives unequivocal tokens of a return to life and power. I n April he enters Taurus ( ), and in May Gemini ( ). During these two months he greatly revives in light and heat, and th e days rap- idly lengthen. The sun, however, does not attain th e summit of the zodiacal arch until the summer solstice, in June, when he enters Cancer ( ), the first summer sign and the third from the vernal equinox. Nor does he regain all of his e nergy and power until he enters Leo ( ) in July. On the 21st of June, when the sun arrives at the su mmer solstice, the constellation Leo —being but 30° in advance of the sun—appears to be leading the way and to aid by his power- ful paw in lifting the sun up to the summit of the zodiacal arch. April and May are therefore said to fail in t heir attempt to raise the sun; June alone succeeds by the aid of Leo. When, at a more remote period, the summer solstice was in Leo, and the sun actually entered the stars of that constellatio n was more intimate, and the allegory still more perfect. 91"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy ASTRO- MASONIC EMBLEM ---- SUN IN LEO This visible connection between the constellation Leo and the return of the sun to his place of power and glo ry, at the summit of the Royal Arch of heaven, was the princip al reason why that constellation was held in such high esteem and rev- erence by the ancients. The astrologers distinguish ed Leo as the \"sole house of the sun,\" and taught that the wo rld was cre- ated when the sun was in that sign. The lion was adored in the East and the West by the Egyptians and the Mexicans. The chief Druid of Brit ain was styled a lion.

The diagram on page 92 is intended, by a figure of the zodiac, to illustrate the yearly progress of the su n among the twelve signs, with especial reference to the allego ry of his death and return to life, as explained in the prece ding pages. In this figure of the zodiac the vernal equinox is represented as being somewhere between the constellations Aries and Taurus, and the summer solstice between Cancer and Leo. Such was the case at the period of the building of King Solomon's temple, and for a long period before that ; only, the farther back we go in time, the nearer Leo will be to the sum- mer solstice, in consequence of the precession of t he equi- noxes, as has been explained in a preceding chapter . In order to fully illustrate the allegory by means of the dia- gram, bring the image of the sun, on the white circle, to the summer solstice, immediately under the key-stone, a nd figure of the personified sun-god, at the top of the grey circle; then slowly turn the white circle toward the autumnal equinox, so that the image of the sun in the white circle will pass succes- sively by the constellations from Leo to the winter solstice at the bottom of the grey circle. This closes the firs t part of the allegory. Continue to turn the white circle until t he vernal equinox is reached, and then on through Taurus, Gem ini, and Cancer ( ), until the point of the sun's exaltation is once more attained.

The emblem may be thus explained: the form that lie s dead before the altar is that of Osiris, the person ified sun-god, whom the candidate represents in the drama of initi ation, lying dead at the winter solstice. The cross upon h is breast refers to the great celestial cross, or intersectio n of the celestial equator by the ecliptic. The figure of the lion gra sping the dead sun-god by the hand alludes to the constellati on Leo and the summer solstice, at which point the sun is rais ed to life and glory, as has been just explained in the allego ry of the res- urrection of the sun, and denotes that the candidat e is about to be raised from a symbolical death to life and power by the grip of the lion's paw. This is made clearly manife st from the fact that the lion holds in his other paw the ancie nt Egyptian symbol of eternal life, or the Cruz Ansata, a full description of which and its true meaning are given in Part Third (see page 210). The tablet at the feet of the candidate has i nscribed upon it in hieroglyphics the sacred names of Amon and of Mat, the wife of Amon Ra, and probably that of the royal candidate. The figure erect at the altar is that of the Grand Hierophant, attired as Isis, with the vacant throne upon her he ad, emblem- atic of the departed sun-God. She has her hand rais ed in an attitude of command, her hand forming a right angle ; her eyes are fixed upon the emblematic lion as she gives the sign of command that the candidate be raised from death and dark- ness to light and life. The objects on the altar are two of those peculiar- shaped glass jars, with pointed bases, in which wine was k ept (See Wilkinson's \"Egyptians of the Time of the Pharaohs\" page 86, 99"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy woodcut 62), and which, the same author says, \"alwa ys had their place on the altar of the gods\" (page 13). Th e emblem placed between the votive jars of wine is more obsc ure. It may be the thyrsus, but is more probably a floral offering. (See \"Ancient Egyptians,\" vol. i, woodcut 260, No. 5.) T here can be no doubt but that the whole device is a symbolical picture of the initiation of some important person into the My steries, not of Osiris, however, as Brother Paterson thinks, but of Isis, who, represented by the Grand Hierophant, stands be hind the altar, giving the command to raise from death Osiri s, who lies before it. This ancient Egyptian drawing is a stron g and star- tling testimony of the entire correctness of the as tronomical solution of the legend of Osiris and that of Hiram, as given in the foregoing pages. It is indeed, almost impossibl e to make an emblematic drawing which would be in more perfec t har- mony with it. The Judgment of the Dead As the judgment of the dead, or Judgment of Amenti, formed a part of the Mysteries of Isis, it should b e properly mentioned in that connection. Although this ceremon y was part of the Mysteries, yet it was well known to all , as it was founded upon the peculiar funeral rites of the Egyp tians. From this judgment in this world no Egyptian was exempt, no mat- ter how exalted his position; and upon this trial d epended the right to an honorable burial. All whom the deceased person had wronged, and all who knew of his evil deeds, we re per- mitted to testify over his dead body, while his fri ends and kin- dred loudly proclaimed his virtues. The decision fo llowed the weight of the evidence; and even a king who had led a bad and wicked life might be excluded from burial in hi s own sep- ulchre. And the \"assessors\" at the funeral were all owed to pro- nounce a condemnation, which all agreed would also be received in a future state. This trial of the dead in this world was typical of the judgment of Amenti, where Osiris presided 100"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Chapter 6. Allegory of the Death of the Sun in the invisible world, and which the devout Egypti an believed took place there at the same time. From this peculiar custom of the Egyptians arose a part of the ceremonies of initiation into the Mysteries of Isis; for, as in initiation, the candidate died symbolically, so als o he under- went the Judgment of the dead, to ascertain if he w as worthy to receive the higher and more important secrets, b y being raised and brought to light, typical of the admissi on of the good into the \"mansions of the blessed.\" The last j udgment is one of the principal subjects found depicted upon t he walls of tombs and in the \"Book of the Dead,\" sometimes refe rring to the actual trial, at others to its representations as enacted in the Mysteries. This judgment of the dead was peculi ar to the national customs and funeral rites of the Egyptians , and does not appear to have prevailed in other countries. It was there- fore naturally discontinued as a part of the Myster ies when they were introduced into other countries other nam es. The Greeks, however, introduced it into their mythology —the Greek Themis being derived from the Egyptian Themei, or goddess of Justice; while Minos and Rhad-amanthus, the Gre- cian judges of the dead in Hades, show their connec tion with Amenti, the Egyptian Hades, or region of darkness. The trans- port of the body over the sacred lake in the baris, or boat, in the funeral procession of the Egyptians, in like ma nner, gave rise to the Acherusian lake, the ferryboat of Charo n, and the passage of the Styx, in the Grecian mythology.

Thus Virgil, referring to a remoter age, in the \"Georgics,\" Book I says: \"Candidus auratis aperit cum Cornibus annum taurus.\" \"When the bright bull with gilded horns opens the year.\" Job speaks of the Pleiades, also, as exerting \"a sw eet influ- ence,\" expressive of the balmy air of spring which accompa- nies the approach of the sun to the constellation T aurus and the \"seven stars.\" This masonic emblem, therefore, has a direct allusion to the vernal equinox, and thus becomes a beautiful symbol of immortality, reminding us, also, of that starry home beyond the grave to which the soul of man aspires. It was for these reasons that, of all the \"hosts of heaven,\" t he Pleiades were selected as an emblem by our ancient brethren. 107"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy The Ladder of Seven Rounds Q. What is the true meaning of this ancient emblem? A. The ladder of seven rounds, says the London \"Fre emason's Magazine,\" has been a symbol in many ages and count ries. Among the ancients every round was considered to be represented by a metal increasing in purity, from t he lowest to the highest, and these were again charact er- ized by the names of the seven planets as follows: The first round is the lowest; therefore they will read from the bottom to the top: 7. Gold — the Sun; 6. Silver — the Moon; 5. Iron — Mars; 4. Tin—Jupiter; 3. Quicksilver — Mercury; 2. Copper — Venus; 1. Lead — Saturn. This planetary signification given to the seven rou nds of the ladder, as stated by the writer of the above, i s in perfect harmony with the religious ideas of the ancients wh o wor- shipped the sun and planets, and the several allego rical leg- ends which they founded upon the facts of astronomi cal science. Near the site of ancient Babylon are the ruins of t he great Temple of the Seven Spheres, which for a long time was thought to identical with the great Temple of Belus, described by Herodotus, situated in Babylon, and which it clo sely, though not exactly resembles. The builder of this t emple is unknown, and the date of its original structure is also uncer- tain. It was, however, restored and carefully renov ated by Nebuchadnezzar, whose name is still legible on the bricks and cylinders deposited at the angles. The account whic h the royal restorer gives of his work has been likewise found on the inscriptions among the ruins. The following particu lars as to this great temple, which is a type of the plan and character of 108"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. Astronomical Explanations all the Babylonian sacred buildings, is taken from Rawlinson's Appendix to Book III of Herodotus. The ruins were c arefully and completely explored by Sir H. Rawlinson himself but a few years ago. Like the great Temple of Belus at Ba bylon, as described by Herodotus, the Temple of the Seven Sph eres was a building of seven receding stages. At the top of the seventh stage was placed the ark, or tabernacle, which seems to have been fifteen feet high. The ornamentation of the bu ilding was almost solely by color. The seven stages were colored so as to represent th e seven planetary spheres, according to the tints regarded by the Sabaens as appropriate to the seven luminari es, the basement being black, the hue assigned to Satur n; the next an orange, the hue of Jupiter; the third a bright red, the hue of Mars; the fourth a golden hue of th e Sun; the fifth a pale yellow, the hue of Venus; the sixth dark blue, the hue of Mercury; the seventh silver, the hue of the Moon. From the fact that the seven stages by which the su mmit of the temple was reached were thus dedicated to the s even planets, it is evident that the symbolism of the se ven steps of the ladder, and the seven ascending stages of the t emple is the same. The order in which the planets are arranged is, how- ever, not exactly the same as that of the steps of the ladder as given by the \"Freemasons' Magazine\" of London. The latter seems to be founded mostly on the supposed order of the metals as to purity. That the order of the planets, as applied to the seven stages of the temple, is the most correct according to the ancient symbolism of the Babylonians and other Oriental nations, can not be doubted, for the ruins of the t emple itself place that beyond question. It is also equally evid ent, from the description of Herodotus, that the symbolism of the seven stages of the Temple of the Seven Spheres is the sa me as that of the great Temple of Belus itself at Babylon. One of the prin- cipal emblems of the ancient Mysteries, both of Per sia and India, was a ladder of seven rounds or steps, and i t may be 109"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy traced back to the very builders of those temples. In attempt- ing to ascertain the true meaning of this emblem, w e must not forget that the Babylonians and the Sabaens were wo rshippers of the planets. It is also equally important to rem ember that they were adepts in astronomy, and believed in and practiced astrology. This is evident from sacred history. We read in Daniel ii that Nebuchadnezzar (the same who rebuilt or restored this very Temple of the Seven Spheres) was troubled by a dream, which he commanded \"the magicians, the astrolo- gers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to interpret for him.\" (See also v. 7, and many other passages of Sc ripture.) The Chaldeans were a branch of the great Hamite rac e of Ak Kad, which inhabited Babylonia from the earliest times. With them originated the art of writing, the build- ing of cities, the institution of religious systems , the cultivation of all science, but that of astronomy in particular. (H. C. Rawlinson) The sciences of astronomy and astrology will, there fore, no doubt furnish the key to the symbolism of not only the seven stage of the temple, but the seven rounds of the la dder also. In truth, the reference in both to the seven planets p oints us ear- nestly in that direction. The sun on the 21st of December is at his lowest po int of declination below the equator, and the days are the darkest and the nights the longest, while all nature lies d ead, locked in the arms of winter. On the 21st of March the sun re aches the vernal equinox. Spring begins, and nature revives f rom the death of winter. On the 21st of June the sun reache s the sum- mer solstice, when the days are the longest, and th e sun seems for the first time to have regained all his former power and glory. Now, it will be observed, by looking at any celestial globe, that the progress of the sun from its lowest to its highest declination is divided into seven equal parts by th e seven signs of the zodiac, through which he passes, or in which he is, while mounting upward from the winter to the su mmer sol- 110"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. Astronomical Explanations stice. The sun, starting in Capricornus, passes successively through Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, and Gemini, until he reaches the summer solstice, or summit of the zodia cal arch, on the 21st of June. If the reader will take the tr ouble to trace this ascending path of the sun along the ecliptic o n a celestial globe, its symbolical significance will be impressi vely illus- trated. It must, however, be remembered that the wi nter and summer solstice were anciently in Aquarius and Leo, and not in Capricornus and Cancer, as they now are, owing to the precession of the equinoxes. The Hindu astronomer, Varaha, says, \"Certainly the south- ern solstice was once in the middle of Asleha (Leo), and the northern in Dhanishta (Aquarius).\" Modern astronomers all declare the same thing. A study of the various astr onomical myths of antiquity shows that the most of them orig inated when the summer solstice was either in Leo or betwe en Leo and Cancer. In the days, therefore, when planetary worship had its rise, the sun, in his passage from the wint er to the sum- mer solstice, started in Aquarius and ascended successively through the signs Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, and Cancer, 30° each, and entered Leo at the summit of the zodiacal arch on the 21st of June. These seven signs are therefor e symbolical of seven ascending stages or steps, and, according to the sci- ence of astrology, these seven signs, following eac h other in this exact order, are the houses of the seven plane ts (which they rule and signify) in exactly this order: Satur n, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury, the Moon, and the Sun. But by a strange correspondence this is the exact o rder in which the planets are arranged as ruling the seven ascending stages of the Temple of the Seven Spheres, with but one exception. The moon, whose house is Cancer, and which sign she rules (according to astrology), is at the top o f the seven stages, while the sun is placed in the center, betw een Mars and Venus, who rule the vernal signs Aries and Taur us. This is, however, in perfect harmony with the ancient allego ry above 111"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy given, for anciently the vernal equinox was between Aries and Taurus, the summer solstice being between Leo and Cancer. The base of the temple, therefore, symbolized the w inter sol- stice—the appropriate color of which was black, and its signif- icator Saturn or Time, which destroys all things. It referred to the sun at his lowest point of declination, and whe n Nature is desolate and dead. The central stage, ruled by the sign Aries and Taurus, between which the sun was emblematically represente d by his color, was typical of that luminary raised to life again at the vernal equinox, when the sun entered those signs in the spring. The seventh stage, or summit of the temple, was in like manner typical of the summer solstice, anciently be tween Cancer and Leo. Cancer is ruled by the moon, and Leo is the sole house of the sun (according to the teaching of astrology). The top and last stage was therefore represented to be of the color of the moon, denoting that the sun was no w approaching the highest point of his journey, and w as about to be exalted to the summit of the zodiacal arch. T he colors, as given by Herodotus, are also in exact harmony with the sci- ence of astrology, and so also is the rule of the s even metals by their respective planets, as given by the \"Freem asons' Mag- azine\" (see Ptolemy, Placidus, Lilly, and Zadkiel's \"Grammar of Astrology,\" for the teachings of astrology on these points; also, as to the houses of the planets and their rule). We should be pleased to follow this subject still further, but e nough has been said to show the close connection between the seven ascend- ing stages of the great Temple of Belus and the Temple of the Seven Spheres at Babylon, with the emblem of the ladder of seven steps as exhibited in the Persian Mysteries, and, indeed, all of the Oriental Mysteries.

What is the signification of the ladder of three rounds, and why is it represented as leading up to the \"seven s tars,\" or Pleiades? A. This emblem is clearly but a modification of the ladder of the Mysteries, consisting, as we have seen, of seve n rounds— and is of the same general astronomical meaning. Th e sun, when ascending from the winter solstice to the vern al equi- nox, the constellation Taurus ( ), and the Pleiades, or seven stars, situated therein, passes successively throug h three signs of the zodiac, to wit, Aquarius ( ), Pisces ( ), and Aries ( ).

The fore- going is the emblem of the masonic ladder as genera lly repre- sented (see Monitors).

Its sy mbolism is, however, thus made more extended and impressive, so that we gain rather than lose by so referring it. THE ZODIACAL LADDER The initiation into all the ancient mysteries, it w ill be remembered, was a drama founded upon the astronomical allegory of the death and resurrection of the sun, and was intended to, and did, impress upon the mind of the candidate, in the strongest manner possible, the two great doc trines of the unity of God and the immortality of man. These are today the two great fundamental principle s of Freemasonry, and are illustrated and taught in a si milar man- ner in the ritual of the third degree. The solar allegory and emblems of the ancient myste ries have, however, a twofold meaning: 1. Being founded, as before stated, on the passage of the sun among the twelve constellations of the zodiac—h is over- throw by the three autumnal months, his return to l ife at the 114"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. Astronomical Explanations vernal equinox, and his exaltation at the summer so lstice— they therefore taught and illustrated all the leadi ng principles of astronomy, and thus had an important scientific value to the initiated. 2. By personifying the sun, and requiring the candi date to represent him, the whole solar phenomena were exhib ited in an allegorical manner, and became symbolical of the unity of God and the immortality of the soul. The ladder of the Myster- ies, being but an emblem intended to illustrate the main solar allegory, had the same two-fold symbolism. When fully explained to the initiated, it fixed upo n the mind certain great facts in astronomical science. I t taught the order and position of the signs of the zodiac; the ascent of the sun from the point of his lowest declination below the equator to that of his highest above it, by seven equal gra duated steps. It also taught the duration and order of the season s, the length of the solar year, and many other particulars of th e greatest importance to agriculture, as well as to science an d art generally. The emblem, viewed in an allegorical sense, also ta ught, by solar analogy, the unity of God and the life eve rlasting. The ladder in this sense was the emblem of the ascent i nto heaven from the lower hemisphere—the underworld of darknes s, winter, and death. This mystic ladder leads to the \"seven stars,\" or Pleiades, shining in the constellation Taurus, at the golden gates of spring. It mounted still onward and upward, to the summit of the Royal Arch of heaven, thus emblem atically teaching us that by the ladder of virtue the soul o f man will at last pierce the \"cloudy canopy,\" and mount to the h ighest cir- cle of \"the starry-decked heavens,\" to dwell for ev er trium- phant over death and the grave.

Faith, Hope, and Charity Q. Why may the three principal rounds of this ladde r be also said to emblematically represent \"faith, hope, and charity?\" A. When the sun has reached his lowest southern dec lination, and begins to ascend toward the vernal equinox, we have nothing but faith in the goodness of God and the immutability of the laws of nature to sustain our belief that th e sun will once more \"unlock the golden gates of spring\"; but, when the sun enters Pisces ( ) and ascends the second round of the ladder, hope is added to our faith, for the sun is seen already to have climbed up two thirds of the distance requi red to reach the vernal equinox; and when, at last, on the 21st of March, he mounts the third round of the ladder and enters Aries ( ), the \"sweet influences of the Pleiades\" are once more felt, while beneath the warm rays of the verna l sun the snows dissolve, and the earth begins again \"to put on her beautiful attire.\" \"For lo! the winter is past, and the flowers appear on the earth, and the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in the l and.\" The third and last round of the zodiacal ladder is ther efore emblematic of charity, or that divine love and benevolence which each year cause the springtime to come in due season. So ought we all to have faith in God, hope in a ble ssed immortality (emblematically represented by the vern al equi- nox), and charity to all mankind. The Three Steps The three steps delineated on the master's carpet h ave an obvious reference to the three steps, or degrees, b y which the initiated becomes a master mason.

Astronomical Explanations reached the vernal equinox by means of the zodiacal ladder) ascends to the summit of the Royal Arch at the summ er sol- stice, which point is, as already explained, emblem atic of the master's degree. The Winding Steps Q. According to the legend of the \"middle chamber\" of the fellow-craft's degree, the workmen were paid their wages in the middle chamber of King Solomon's temple, whi ch was approached by a certain flight of \"winding steps.\" This staircase is said to have consisted of \"three, five , and seven steps\" (according to our lecture), and was reached by entering in at the front door of the temple, passin g between the pillars of the porch. (See Mackey's \"Sy mbol- ism,\" Chapter XXVI.) What is the astronomical impor t and real meaning of this legend? A. The only allusion to these \"winding stairs\" in t he Bible is found in the sixth chapter of 1 Kings. In the fifth verse we are informed that King Solomon \"built chambers round about against the walls of the house\" The sixth verse continues as follows: The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and t he middle chamber was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad, for without in the walls of the house he made narrow rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house. The eighth verse informs us that the door for the middle chamber was on the right side [Hebrew, \"shoulder\"] of the house, and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and ou t of the midst of the middle into the third. The only information which Josephus gives may be fo und in Chapter III, Book VIII, of his \"Antiquities,\" and i s as follows: 117"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy He [Solomon] also built about the temple thirty sma ll rooms, which might include [i.e., surround] the who le temple by their closeness one to another, and by th eir number and outward position round it. He also made passages through them, that they might come into on e through another. Every one of these rooms had five cubits in breadth, and the same in length, but in h eight twenty. Above these were other rooms, and others above them, equal both in their measures and number s, so that these reached to a height equal to the lower part of the house, for the upper part had no buildings about it. The roof that was over the house was of cedar: and, truly, every one of these rooms had a roof of its own that was not connected with the other rooms, but for the other parts there was a covered roof common to them all.... The king had also a fine contrivance for an ascent to the upper room over the temple, and that was by steps cut in the thickness of the wall, for it had no large door on the east end, as the lower house had, but t he entrances were by the sides through very small doors. The above extracts comprise all the information whi ch reli- able history, either sacred or profane, furnishes i n regard to the \"middle chamber\" and the \"winding stairs\" by which it was reached. It is evident, both from the Bible and from Jose- phus, that the \"middle chamber\" and the \"winding st airs\" by which it was reached. It is evident, both from the Bible and from Josephus, that the \"middle chamber\" was no par t of the temple proper; nor, indeed, was it permitted to be fastened to the sacred walls. (See 1 Kings 6, 5, just quoted.) All the cham- bers were built around the outside of the walls, an d were reached from the side, so that in going up to the \" middle chamber\" a person not only did not pass between the pillars of the porch, but did not enter in or pass through any portion whatever of the temple itself. The steps, according to Jose- phus, were \"cut in the thickness of the wall outsid e.\" In view of these authorities, although he does not quote th em, Dr. Mackey may well say 118"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. Astronomical Explanations that the historical facts and the architectural det ails alike forbid us for a moment to suppose that the legend [ of the winding stairs], as it is rehearsed in the seco nd degree of masonry, is anything more than a magnific ent philosophical myth. (Symbolism,\" Chapter XXVI) But if it is a \"philosophical myth\" it must have a symbolical meaning, and be emblematic in its character. The ve ry essence of symbolical teaching consists of the method of se lecting some fact or some real object in nature, art, or science, and by investing it with an emblematic significance throug h compari- son, thus teaching and illustrating some moral or p olitical doc- trine. The anchor is thus made an emblem and illust ration of hope, the beehive of industry, the scythe of time o r death. A real anchor, beehive, or scythe is, however, requir ed as a foundation for this allegorical teaching. If, there fore, the \"leg- end of the winding stairs\" is a \"philosophical myth ,\" either the actual or the emblematic stairs must have a real ex istence somewhere, or they could not have been selected or used for the purpose of conveying a philosophical, symbolica l, or alle- gorical lesson. The \"winding steps,\" as described i n the masonic legend, did not exist in the temple of King Solomon, as we has shown, not only by Josephus, but the bibl e itself. We must, therefore, look elsewhere for them. Now as all the other leading emblems of masonry have an astronomic al orgin, it is but reasonable to suppose that these v ery same \"winding steps,\" leading to the place where the wag es of the craft are paid, will be found in that other \"temple not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.\" As they are no t to be found in the actual temple, let us look for them in the emblem- atic one. But, before doing so, it will be necessary to deter mine more exactly the proper number of these emblematic steps, for their stated number seems to have varied at dif ferent peri- ods and according to different versions of the lege nd. Dr. Oliver mentions an old \"tracing-board,\" publish ed in 1745, 119"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy in which the steps are semicircular, and are but seven in num- ber. Dr. Mackey says, on page 221 of his \"Symbolism ,\" that tracing boards of the last century have been found in which only five steps are delineated, and others in which they amount to seven. The Prestonian lectures used in England in the beginning of this century ga ve the whole number as thirty-six, divided into series of one, three, five, seven, nine, and eleven.... The H em- ming lectures, adopted by the union of the two gran d lodges of England, struck out the eleven.... In the United States the number was still further reduced to fif- teen, divided into three series of three, five, and seven . It thus appears that there has been considerable co nfusion as to the correct number of these symbolical steps. The most ancient versions of the legend make the number eith er five or seven. Now it is a very safe rule to adopt as to al l traditions, including those of masonry, that the older the vers ion the more correct it probably is, for the further back w e trace any legend the nearer we will approach the time of its origin, and, consequently, its primitive and uncorrupted form. A pplying this rule to the case under consideration, we may s afely con- clude that the proper number of steps in those \"win ding stairs\" is either five or seven. If, however, we succeed in finding the steps themselves properly located in the emblematic temple, and leading to the very place where the craft recei ve their wages, we shall be able to determine their exact nu mber by actual count. The building of the temple, represented emblematica lly by the Royal Arch of heaven, was commenced in the spri ng and finished in the autumn. It was, therefore, said to be seven years in building, as has been previously explained . The spring signs, during which the plowing and planting are done, are typical of the E. A. degree; the summer months, when the growing grain requires constant care for its protec tion, of the F. C. degree; and the season in which the harvests are gathered 120"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. Astronomical Explanations and stored away, of the M. M. degree, and those ski lled work- men who wrought at the completion of the temple. During the progress of the sun from the vernal equi nox to the summer solstice, the husbandman is engaged in p reparing the soil and sowing his seeds; during the passage o f the sun from the summer solstice to the autumnal equinox, h e is employed in protecting his maturing crops. In July and August the corn ripens and is harvested, and in the autumn the oil and w ine also reward him for his labors. The wages of the faithful craftsmen, we are told, a re \"corn, oil, and wine.\" The seven signs of the zodiac, from the vernal equinox to the first point of Scorpio, \"winding\" in a glittering curve about the heavens, may in a like manner be sa id to be emblematic of seven winding steps, leading to the p lace where— Corn, Oil, and Wine —are brought forth to reward the labors of the husb and- man. The sun arrives at Aries on the 21st of March, and reaches Scorpio about the 21st of October, passing succes- sively through The number of these emblematic steps is therefore seven, thus corresponding with the more ancient versions of the fellow-craft legen d; and it will also be observed that they are really semicircular in form. This perfectly harmonizes with the \"seven semicircular s teps\" of the ancient \"tracing-board\" mentioned by Dr. Oliver. It is also wor- thy of notice that, just as that part of the year e mbraced within these seven signs may be divided into three periods —1. That of plowing and planting; 2. That of growing and mat uring; and, 3. That of harvesting and storing—so these emb lematic steps may also be divided into three groups, which find an appropriate expression in the numbers 3, 5, and 7. The first three signs, Aries, Taurus, and Gemini, denote the season of plowing and planting. The next, two, Cancer and Leo, making five from the vernal equinox, denote the period during w hich the crops ripen and mature; and the last two, Virgo and Libra, 121"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy making seven in all, rule the harvest-season—and th e storing away of the corn, oil, and wine, with which the solar bounty has rewarded the labors of the faithful husbandman. The American division of the steps into three group s, expressive of the numbers 3, 5, and 7, is therefore correct, but the total number of steps is seven, and not fifteen. It is ea sy to see how this latter error, as to the mystic import of the num- bers 3, 5 and 7 was made, in consequence of the tru e nature of the symbolism of the seven steps being lost. The legend of the \"winding stairs\" informs us that they conducted between the two pillars of the porch. Dr. Oliver, in his \"Landmarks\" (note 19 to Lecture XVI), says that \"the equi- noctial points are called pillars, because the great semicircle, or upper hemisphere, seems to rest upon them.\" If t his sym- bolism be correct, then, the \"winding stairs\" do, i n fact, lead past and between these celestial pillars, in perfec t harmony with the allegory of the legend. Thus explained, th e legend of the \"winding stairs,\" leading to the place where \"c orn, oil, and wine\" are delivered as a reward to the faithful lab orer in the vineyard, is a most beautiful and significant astro nomical alle- gory. Like all the other astronomical allegories an d symbols of Freemasonry, it not only (when properly understood) reveals important and valuable scientific facts respecting the move- ments of the heavenly bodies, but at one and the sa me time inculcates, in a sublime and impressive manner, gre at moral truths. It teaches us, among other things, that ind ustry not only deserves but receives its due reward. It also displ ays the benevolence of the Great Creator, who causes the ea rth to bring forth her fruits in due season: He watereth the hills from above; The earth is filled with the fruit of his works; He bringeth forth the grass for the cattle, And the green herb for the service of man: That he may bring forth fruit out of the earth; And wine, that maketh glad the heart of man; 122"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Chapter 7.

Psalm 104:15-15 It reminds us also of the covenant which God made w ith Noah in the olden time: \"That he would no more curse the ground for man's sake; but that while the earth remained s eedtime and harvest should not cease\" (Genesis 8:21-22). Th ese and many other important lessens are taught by the astr o-masonic symbol of the \"winding stairs\"; and those lessens a re made still more impressive from the fact that the Archetype of these \"winding stairs\" is not to be found in any transito ry, earthly mansion, but far above, set in the eternal majesty of the starry firmament. The Blazing Star Q. To what does the masonic emblem of the Blazing S tar allude? THE BLAZING STAR A. To the sun the midst of heaven, as a symbol of D eity. Even Dr. Oliver, who has no sympathy with the astronomic al theory of the origin of Freemasonry, says: The \"Blazing Star\" must not be considered merely as the creature which heralded the appearance of T. G. A. O. T. U., but the expressive symbol of that Great Being himself, who is described by the magnificent appella- tions of the Day-Spring, or Rising Sun, the Morning Star.

ANUBIS Other writers identify the Blazing Star with Sirius , the most just before the sun, each year, gave the ancient Egyptia ns warning of the approaching inundation of the Nile; hence th ey compared it to a faithful dog, whose bark gives war ning of approaching danger, and named it Sothis, Anubis, and Thotes, the barker, or monitor. This brilliant and beautifu l-star thus early became known \"dog-star\". The Egyptians deifie d it under the name of Anubis, and this god was emblematically repre- sented by the figure of a man with a head of a dog.

The word \"circumambulation\" is derived from two Latin words (circum, around, and ambulare, to walk), and there- fore means to walk around, that is, around the alta r, or some sacred shrine. The rite of circumambulation formed a leading part of the ceremonies of the Mysteries, and of sol ar worship in all countries. This rite had a direct solar allu sion, as it was always performed from right to left in imitation of the appar- ent course of the sun from east to west by way of t he south. In the Mysteries of India the candidate went thus abou t the altar three times, and, whenever he arrived in the south, was taught to exclaim, \"I copy the example of the sun, and fol low his benevolent path!\" This sacred march was generally, in all the Mysteries, accompanied by the singing or chanting o f an ode or hymn to the sun-god. Among the Druids it partook of the nature of a mystic dance. The candidate, in perform ing the rite of circumambulation, it will be seen, represented t he sun, or rather the personified sun, or sun-god, which he co ntinued to do through the entire ceremony, from the moment of his intro- duction up to his symbolical death— Euresis and raising or restoration to life. Dr. Mackey says, in his \"Symbo lism of Free- masonry,\" Chapter XXI, that \"the masonic rite of ci rcumambu- lation strictly agrees with the ancient one,\" and t hat, as the circumambulation is made around the lodge just as the sun was supposed to move around the earth, we are brought back to the original symbolism\" of the sun's apparent course about the earth. The direct derivation of this masonic rite from the solar mysteries of the ancients is too plain to be for a moment denied; and it is absurd to suppose that any such r ite could have been invented by the traveling operative mason ic associ- ations of the middle ages. And this absurdity will attach to the whole ceremony of which this rite is but a part (in fact, almost the initial step), for the same solar significance characterizes the whole ritual, all parts of which are in perfect harmony with the symbolism admitted to be connected with the rit e of circu- 125"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy mambulation. If Freemasonry, therefore, originated with the traveling masons of the middle ages, they must have borrowed these solar ceremonies from some far more ancient s ource, or association, to which those who instituted modern F reema- sonry belonged. Had they invented a ritual, its cer emonies would never have had any such solar significance or symbol- ism: a symbolism which has no harmony or correspond ence with the rules and principles of architecture. On t he other hand, if, for peculiar reasons, these operative mas ons and architects really became the last and sole custodia ns of the rites and ceremonies of the ancient mysteries, we c an quite easily see how they have been handed down to us in a more or less corrupted form by them. What those circumstances were that thus connected t he architects of the middle ages with the ancient myst eries will be treated of more at length in subsequent pages; and the link which thus united the temple builders of Egypt, Gre ece, and Rome with the cathedral-builders of Europe under th e reign of Christianity will be pointed out. The Square Q. Whence was the square, as a masonic emblem, deri ved? A. It is a general impression, among masons and oth ers, that the square, or right angle, as an emblem, was deriv ed wholly from operative masonry, and is but one of the worki ng tools of a mechanical art adopted as an emblem by specula tive masons. This idea is countenanced by Cross in his \" American Chart,\" who says, \"The square is an instrument made use of by operative masons to square their work,\" and then pr oceeds to moralize upon it. This idea has also found its way into all the monitors. The square, or right angle, as an emblem is, how- ever, geometrical and not mechanical in its origin, and dates back to the ancient Egyptians, in whose solemn proc essions the Stolistes carried the cubit of justice, by whic h perpendicu- lars, right angles, and squares might be laid out, its form being 126"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. Astronomical Explanations CUBIT OF JUSTICE that of one arm of a square, with the inner end cut to an angle of 45°, or one half of a right angle. The square wa s in Egypt an emblem of justice, because being a right angle it d eviated in no respect from a true horizontal joined to a perfect perpen- dicular. The close analogy between justice and that which is perfectly upright is so obvious, in fact, as to hav e become uni- versal. The terms \"an upright man\" and a \"just man\" are in nearly all languages synonymous, hence the Scriptur al phrases: \"The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just\" (Isa. 26:7); \"He that w alketh uprightly\" (Psalm 15:2); and the admonition \"to wal k uprightly before God and man.\" Besides this, the square was u sed in Egypt to redetermine the boundaries of each man' s possessions when, as frequently happened, the landm arks were swept away by the inundation of the Nile, thus recover- ing to every man his just rights. The Egyptian land -measure itself was an aroura, or a square, containing one hundred cubits. (Wilkinson's \"Egypt.\") The square, or right angle, represents 90°, or the fourth part of a circle, and has a direct allusion to divi sion of the ecliptic and celestial equator into four equal part s, indicative of the solstitial and equinoctial points, and the d ivision of the year into four seasons. By it we are also enabled t o divide the circle of the horizon into quadrants, and by the ai d of the sun in the south to correctly mark out the four cardina l points of the compass. In not only geometry, but astronomy al so, the use of the right angle is indispensable; and, as it s use was thus connected not only with the loftiest problems of sc ience, but with religion also, it soon became universally adop ted by the ancients as a sacred emblem, not only of justice, b ut of recti- tude of conduct.

Masonic Festivals Q. What was the origin of the two great masonic fes tivals, held formerly on the 24th of June and 27th of Decem ber in each year? A. The celebration of those days was purely astrono mical in its origin, and refers to the summer and winter sol stice. The summer solstice, on the 21st of June, was celebrate d as a great solar festival by the ancients, because at that tim e the sun was exalted to the summit of the zodiacal arch, and att ained his greatest power and glory. The arrival of the sun at the winter solstice in December and the commencement of his re turn north toward the vernal equinox was also celebrated in an appropriate manner. The sun was then considered (ac cording to another allegory) to be new-born, and the moment of his emerging from the constellation which marked his lo west dec- lination was celebrated as the hour of his nativity . At this period, says Macrobius, \"the day being the shortest , the god seems to be but a feeble child.\" After that, he beg ins to grow, as some say, nourished by a goat, alluding to the c onstellation Capricorn, and the days begin to lengthen. The grea t festival of the new birth of the sun was therefore celebrate d at this period. These festivals, originally observed on the days of the summer and winter solstices, came in time, owing to the varia- tion of the calendar (as before explained), to be c elebrated on the 24th of June and 27th of December instead of th e 21st of those months. Modern masons, however, dedicated the se days respectively to St. John the Baptist and St. John t he Evangelist, who, it is alleged, were born the one at the summer and the other at the winter solstice, and were eminent patr ons of Free- masonry. There is, however, no historical evidence to support this statement, and the celebration of these days b y the frater- nity generally has been very properly discontinued. 128"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. Astronomical Explanations The Circle Embordered by Two Parallel Lines Q. In every lodge may be seen \"a certain point with in a circle embordered by two parallel lines.\" Have masons lost the true meaning of this emblem? A. They have. Q. What does this emblem signify? A. The astronomical signification of this emblem is so appar- ent that it seems to have forced itself upon the at tention of many intelligent masons. Dr. Oliver, in his Diction ary, says: The symbol of a point within a circle has sometimes been invested with an astronomical reference. Thus it said that the point in the circle represents the Su preme Being, the circle indicates the annual circuit of t he sun, and the parallel lines mark out the solstices, with in which that circuit is limited. And they deduce from this hypothesis this corollary: that the mason, by subje cting himself to due bounds, in imitation of that gloriou s luminary, will not wander from the path of duty. This explanation is concurred in by Dr. Mackey, not with- standing his disapproval of the astronomical theory . It is, how- ever, far more reasonable than the explanation give n in the lecture appertaining to this degree, but is not in all respects correct. It is true that the circle represents the ecliptic or annual path of the sun, but the \"point within the c ircle\" does not represent the Supreme Being, but the earth, around which, as a center, the sun appears to annually revolve am ong the stars of the zodiac. The parallel lines are the tro pics of Cancer ( ) and Capricorn ( ). The summer solstice is on the 21st of June, and the winter solstice on the 21st of Decemb er. These are the solstitial points, always marked by two par allel lines representing the tropics, as may be seen on any ter restrial globe or map. These two dates, as we have remarked in the answer to the previous question, have been said to be the respective birthdays of St. John the Baptist and St . John the 129"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy Evangelist, but there is no authentic history to su bstantiate the assertion. CIRCLE EMBORDERED BY PARALLEL LINES The sun's circuit among the stars is limited and de fined by the tropics. When, in June, he reaches the tropic o f Cancer, and attains his greatest northern declination he go es no farther north, but turns and begins to approach the south. He reaches his greatest southern declination in December at th e other tropic, which terminates his southern progress, for he there again turns about, and once more journeys toward th e north. Upon the integrity of the sun's movement, in this p articular, depend all the order and regularity of the seasons. Should the sun not retrograde at the summer solstice, the heat would grow intolerable, and both vegetable and animal exi stence not only become impossible from that cause, but the mel ting of the polar snows and ice would produce another delug e. If the sun, on the contrary, turned not back at the winter solstice, eternal winter would reign in all lands north of th e equator, and a perpetual glacial era extinguish all life and vegetation. The foregoing cut is without question the most anci ent and proper method of exhibiting the emblem of \"a circle embor- dered by two parallel lines.\" The circle, in order to correspond with our modern ideas of the points of the compass, should be turned abou t so that 130"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. Astronomical Explanations the two parallel lines would be in a horizontal and not in a perpendicular position. The tropic of Cancer ( ) would then be at the north, and the tropic of Capricorn ( ) at the south, in accordance with our custom of devoting the top o f any map or draft to the north and the lower part to the sou th. The Hebrews, however, and other ancient Oriental nation s, when speaking of the four quarters of the heavens, always supposed the spectator to be looking east, toward the rising sun; and in their language \"before\" meant \"east,\" \"behind\" \"west,\" the right hand south, and the left north—as, for instance, the Hebrew word kedem means not only before, but also east. The same custom as to the points of the compass prevail ed with the Arabians, who called the north shemal, a word meaning at the left. This ancient custom fully accounts for the fact tha t in this emblem the two lines representing the tropics are placed in a perpendicular and not in a horizontal position . The fur- ther fact that in some of the Indian cave-temples t he circle is found, actually inscribed with the signs of the zod iac, makes the correctness of the foregoing explanation certai n. The absurdity of supposing that the operative masons of the mid- dle ages invented this emblem in connection with th eir art is plain. Q. Of what does this emblem admonish us? A. As the sun, in his annual course around the circ le of the ecliptic, perpetually performs his revolution with regularity and certainty, never straying beyond the tropical p oints, but always returning in due season to beautify, adorn, and fructify the earth, so ought we all to govern our actions wi th equal certainity and regularity, adorning our lives with wisdom and virtue, and making our years fruitful of good deeds , never suffering our passions to lead us beyond the bounda ry line of good conduct or the points of reason, for, while we keep ourselves thus circumscribed, it is impossible for us materially to err. 131"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy The Lamb-Skin Q. To what does the lamb-skin, or white-leather apr on, allude? A. The vernal equinox, where the sign Aries is found. This sign, as we have seen, teaches immortality, as well as being emblematic of innocence and beauty. It is a mistake to suppose that the apron, as an ar ticle of dress, was confined in ancient times to operative m asons and other mechanics. On the contrary, it was an indispe nsable part of the ordinary apparel of the ancient Egyptians of all classes, and was worn by kings, priests, and nobles, as well as the common people. The apron of the king was, however, of a peculiar form, which belonged exclusively to his ra nk.

Whence originated the emblem of the all-seeing e ye? A. In most of the ancient languages of Asia, \"eye\" and \"sun\" are expressed by the same word, and the ancient Egy ptians hieroglyphically represented their principal deity, the sun-god Osiris, by the figure of an open eye, emblematic of the sun, by whose light we are enabled to see, and which itself looks down from the midst of heaven, and beholds all thin gs.

Masonic Signs Q. To what does the first sign of an E. A. M. allud e? A. To the autumnal equinox, or place of darkness, a nd the sign Libra ( ), which is found there, composed of two parallel lines. This sign teaches equality, because at the e quinox the days and nights are equal. Equality is the first le sson which a mason receives: The king from out his palace must leave his diadem outside the mason's door, And the poor man find his true respect upon the che ck- ered floor. (Morris) The sign Libra also teaches us to weigh all things in the scales of reason. It is probable that the first sig n of an E. A. M. alludes to both equinoctial points. When the sun enters Libra he takes the first of the three leading to his overthrow at the winter solstice; and in like manner, when he enters Aries, at the vernal equinox, he takes the first toward his exaltation at the summer solstice. Q. To what does the first sign of a F. C. M. allude ? A. The first three signs of the zodiac, subtending an angle of 90° from the vernal equinox to the summer solstice. Q.

It also alludes to that benediction or b lessing which the sun of the summer solstice bestows upon the lab ors of the husbandman, and has always been considered the sign of benediction and prayer. (Matt. 19:13-15; Acts 6:6; 13:3.) Masonic Significance of the Zodiacal Signs Q. Have the zodiacal signs any further masonic sign ificance? ASTROLOGICAL FIGURE OF HOMO A. They have, of some important particulars: Astrology was a leading branch of astronomy as cultivated by the Eg yptians. The first six signs of the zodiac, counting from th e vernal 135"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy equinox forward toward the autumnal equinox, may be divided into three parts, typical of the first thre e degrees of masonry. If we count from the first point of Aries forward 60°, we reach and include Taurus. These two are typical of the first degree, and the unskilled workmen who labored at th e prepa- ration of the materials of the temple. Advancing 60 ° farther, we reach and include Cancer. These two signs, Gemini a nd Can- cer, are emblematic of the second degree. Sixty deg rees more take us to and include Virgo, which brings us to th e autumnal equinox, typical of completion, and the skilled wor kmen who wrought at the completion of the temple. The \"signi ficators\" (to use an astrological term) of the first three de grees may therefore be said to be Taurus, Cancer, and Virgo. Now, according to the ancient science of astrology, as cul- tivated by the Egyptians, the sign Taurus ( ) rules the neck and throat; the sign Cancer ( ) the breast; and the sign Virgo ( ) the bowels. The deep and singular significance of this will not be overlooked by any intelligent mason. The ast ronomical rule of the twelve signs over the various parts of the body, according to astrology, is still kept alive by the figure of \"Homo,\" as seen in old almanacs. Champollion says the accompanying figure is from th e Egyptian Ritual of the Dead, and is often found in their papyri. For further information as to the nature of the rul e and influ- ence of the twelve signs, see Lilly's \"Astrology.\" Some very interesting remarks on this subject may also be fou nd in that curious book of Southey's called \"The Doctor,\" Vol. II, Chapter LXXXVII, P. I. See, also, \"Sibley's Astrology,\" Zad kiel's \"Gram- mar of Astrology,\" and Burton's \"Anatomy of Melanch oly.\" As this division of the first six signs into three equal parts makes Virgo one of the \"significators\" of the third degree, we are naturally reminded of the beautiful virgin allu ded to in the modern lecture appertaining to that degree. 136"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. Astronomical Explanations The Beautiful Virgin of the Third Degree Q. What is the origin of the masonic emblem of the beautiful virgin? A. Although the figure of a virgin is no doubt a ve ry ancient emblem, alluding to the Egyptian goddess Isis and t he constel- lation Virgo as well as to the moon, yet the masoni c emblem, as depicted in our monitors, is of late origin. It is in its main features in direct violation with masonic legend an d Jewish law and custom. It could not have had an ancient He brew ori- gin, for the following reasons: 1. The Jewish law forbids the making of any graven images of the kind. Even the Jews of the present ti me will not permit any sculptured figures to be set up as monum ents in their cemeteries. 2. The urn, which is represented as containing the ashes of O. G. M. H. A. B., implies cremation, which was contrary to the fixed custom of the ancient Jews, as well as Eg yptians, which dictated burial. 3. The Jewish law considered the contact, or near approach even, of a dead body unclean, requiring th ose thus exposed to undergo a long period of exclusion and p urifica- tion. Our G. M. H. A. could not, therefore, have be en buried anywhere even in the neighborhood of the temple, mu ch less near the sanctum sanctorum itself. We have, however, positive testimony as to the modern origin of this emblem. A full his- tory of its invention, and when and by whom introdu ced into masonry, is given in a late article by Brother Robe rt B. Folger, in the \"Masonic Newspaper.\" As the communication is of much historical interest, and also fully illustrates the way in which many modern innovations have been made, we give it entire.

The causes which led him first to devise the plan o f such a work were as follows: He was passionately fond of m asonry, studied under Thomas Smith Webb, Gleason, and other s, became perfect under them in the lectures and work, and then started through the country as a lecturer in the ye ar 1810. He was a man of excellent appearance in early life, st rictly tem- perate from his youth up. His manners were preposse ssing, open, frank, very fluent in language, and, withal, a very fine singer. As a matter, of course, he became very popu lar, the business of lecturing flowed in upon him very fast, and he had as much to engage his mind in that line as he could well attend to. Wishing to take advantage of all the bus iness that offered, he found the work slow of accomplishment b y reason of delays caused by imperfect memories. He wanted s ome- thing of an objective kind, which would have the ef fect of bringing to mind the various subjects of his lectur es, and so fixing the details in the mind as, with the sets of objects pre- sented to the sight, the lectures in detail would b e complete. There was not at that time any guide for lodges exc ept the so-called \"Master's Carpet,\" and the works of Prest on and Webb. The \"Master's Carpet\" was deficient, being wi thout many of the most important emblems, and those which it dis- played were very much \"mixed up.\" The work of Prest on did not agree with the \"adopted work.\" That of Webb agr eed per- fectly, but still was wanting in it most important part, viz., the hieroglyphics, by which the work is plainly and uni formly pre- sented to the learner, rendering it easy of acquire ment, and imprinting it upon the mind in such a manner that i t will not readily be forgotten. The second object was a copyright. He knew that in those days the cost of bringing together and putting toge ther, and the bringing out of a work of the kind which he des ired, would throw him into a large expenditure, and, in o rder to get 139"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy back the cost and derive any solid benefit from it in the end, it must of necessity be in his own hands alone. He considered the matter for many months, and final ly attempted to draw various plans, taking Webb's \"Mon itor\" for a guide. Part of the work he accomplished satisfact orily to himself. This included the first and second degrees , and, although there was but little really original in th e emblems which he produced, yet the classification and arran gement were his own. He went on with the third degree very well as far as the \"Monitor\" of Webb goes, when he came to a pause. There was a deficiency in the third degree which ha d to be filled in order to effect his purposes, and he beca me wearied in thinking over the subject. He finally consulted a brother, formerly a Mayor of New Haven, who at the time was one of his most intimate friends, and they, after working together for a week or more, could not hit upon any symbol which would be sufficiently simple and yet answer the purpose. Whereupon the copperplate engraver, also a brother, who was d oing his work, was called in. They went at the business with renewed courage, and the number of hieroglyphics which had by this time accumulated was immense. Some were too large, some too small, some too complicated, requiring too much explana- tion, and many not at all adapted to the subject. F inally, said the copperplate printer: \"Brother Cross, when great men die, they generally have a monument.\" \"That's right,\" said Cross; \"I never thought of tha t,\" and away he went. He was missing from the company, and was found loit er- ing around the burying ground in New Haven in a maz e. He had surveyed all that was there, but did not seem s atisfied.

He would have that pillar for the foundation of his new emblem, but would bring the other part of the pilla r in, leav- ing it to rest against the base. Then one could kno w what it all meant. The other part of the pillar should be there . This was assented to, but more was wanted. They needed some inscrip- tion describing the merits of the dead. They found no place on the column, and after a lengthy discussion they hit upon an open book placed upon the broken pillar. But there should, in the order of things, be some reader of the book; so they selected the emblem of innocence in a beautiful vir gin, who should weep over the memory of the deceased while s he read of his heroic deeds. \"But, sir,\" said I, \"how will you get along with th e Jewish people?

Th ey are very tenacious of the 'law' which forbids the makin g of any image of any kind, and that even the touch of a dea d body by a Jew renders him unclean, and, as a consequence, u nfit to come into the synagogue until after many days' puri fication.

This beautiful daughter of the skies, Virgo, according t o other myth- ological legends, is also the husband of the sun, w ho, when he entered the constellation Virgo, was said to esp ouse her. The whole emblem may therefore be astronomically explained as follows: The virgin weeping over the b roken col- umn denotes her grief at the death of the sun, slai n by the wintry signs. Saturn standing behind her and pointi ng to the summit of the zodiacal arch denotes that Time will heal their sorrows, and, when the year has filled its circuit, her lord the sun will arise from the grave of winter, and, trium phing over all the powers of darkness, come again to her embra ces.

Has the sprig of acacia any further significatio n? A. The astronomical significance of the \"evergreen, \" which we have substituted for the Egyptian acacia, and its allusion to the vernal equinox and the doctrine of immortali ty, has already been fully explained and illustrated. The s ymbolism of the acacia is, however, more extended. The acacia g rows in Egypt, and is the plant from which gum-arabic is ob tained. It is also the acanthus of Herodotus and Strabo. The thickets of acanthus, alluded to by Strabo, still grow above Memphis, at the base of the low Libyan hills. In going from the Nile to Abydos, you ride t hrough the grove of acacia, once sacred to Apollo, and see the canal traversing it, as when the geographer visited that city. (Wilkinson's \"Ancient Egyptians,\" Chapter VI) The acacia is also a symbol of innocence. \"The symbolism here,\" says Dr. Mackey, is of a peculiar and unusual character, depending n ot upon any real analogy of form or use of the symbol to the thing symbolized, but simply on the double or c om- pound meaning of the word. For acacia, in the Greek language, signifies both the plant in question and inno- cence or purity of life. (\"Symbolism,\" Chapter XXVIII) We think Dr. Mackey is mistaken in this. He does no t seem to have been aware, or has overlooked the fact, tha t one spe- cies of the acacia is a sensitive-plant. 148"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. Astronomical Explanations Pliny mentions a sensitive acacia about Memphis. One is now common on the banks of the Nile above Don- gola (the Acacia asperata). The \"Mimosa Lubek\" also grew of old in Egypt, and the Copt Christians have a silly legend of its worshipping the Saviour. (Wilkinson's \"Ancient Egyptians\") The peculiar nature of the sensitive-plant has in a ll ages excited the wonder and superstition of man, and the re is no doubt that it was the Acacia asperata, or mimosa, which was the species of the acacia held as a sacred plant by the ancients. The word acacia is of Greek origin, and to the lively and poetical imagination of the Greeks this sensiti ve-plant, thus shrinking from the touch, was an expressive sy mbol of that innocence which in like manner shrinks from th e rule contact of the world—and thus they named it acacia, a word which means innocence. It therefore appears that there is a real and beautiful analogy \"between the symbol and the idea symbolized,\" and that this symbolism does not \"depe nd simply on the double or compound meaning of the word\" acac ia, as stated by Dr. Mackey; this sensitive plant being named \"inno- cence\" because it was the natural and appropriate e mblem of innocence and purity. The Letter \"G\" Q. Is the custom of displaying the letter \"G\" in ma sonic lodges of any great antiquity? A. That it can not be must appear evident when we r eflect that masonry existed long before the English langua ge. The letter \"G\" as displayed in the lodge is, however, a necessary and appropriate substitute for the equilateral triangle, so prominently used as a sacred symbol by our ancient brethren. The Equilateral Triangle Q. Why so? A. For two reasons: 1. The triangle is the true sig nificator of that noble masonic science, geometry —since, without a 149"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy knowledge of its form and properties, that science is impossi- ble. It was upon the triangle that Pythagoras erect ed his cele- brated and invaluable \"Forty-seventh Proposition.\" He is also said to have discovered that the sum of all the ang les of any triangle is equal to two right angles. It is more p robable, how- ever, that he brought these two propositions, toget her with a knowledge of the true system of the universe, with him from Egypt, where he went to pursue his studies, and was initiated into the Mysteries. 2. The equilateral triangle is also a sacred symbol of the Deity, being the same in its form as the ancient Gr eek delta, or letter \"D.\" The Phoenician letter \"D,\" as well as t he Egyptian, was of a similar form. The equilateral triangle, in the Greek tongue, as well as many other ancient languages, wa s thus the initial letter of the name of Deity. In the days of Pythagoras we are told that, whenever an oath of unusual importan ce was to be taken, it was administered on the equilateral tr iangle, as, by so doing, the name of God was directly invoked. Thi s oath is said never to have been violated. The EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE , therefore, since it is at once the emblem and essen ce of geom- etry, and the initial letter of the name of Deity, should be seen in the midst of every regular masonic assembly. The Compasses Q. According to an ancient custom, the compasses, a s a masonic emblem, whether reposing on the altar or wo rn as an officer's jewel, should be set at an angle of 60 °. What is the reason of this? A. The reason is principally geometrical. The sacre d import of the equilateral triangle has already been explained . Now, as the sum of all the angles of any triangle is equal to two right angles, or 180°, it follows that each of the equal angles of any equilateral triangle is equal to one third of two r ight angles (180°/3 = 60°), which is 60°. 150"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. Astronomical Explanations The compasses being set at 60°, thus allude to the equilat- eral triangle, and, if the two points were united b y a straight line, one would be formed. There can be but little doubt that it was the equilateral triangle itself which our ancie nt brethren placed upon the altar, since it was upon that emble m their most solemn obligations were taken. In modern times the compasses, set at an angle of 60°, have been substi tuted. This may have been done purposely, or it may be that, du ring the dark ages, some of our ignorant mechanical brethren mistook the sacred emblem for one of their working-tools, a nd that the change was thus brought about. Other mistakes equal ly as sin- gular, as will be seen in the sequel, were thus mad e at that period. The angle of 60° has also an allusion to the zodiac , being equal to two signs thereof, and, if multiplied by t he sacred number three, becomes 180°, or the dimensions of th e Royal Arch. Again, if a circle of any size be drawn, a chord of 60° of that circle will be equal to its radius, and the co mpasses so set will divide the circumference into six equal parts. The points thus made, taken with the one in the center, consti tute the mystic number seven. The six exterior points, if joined by six straight lines, will form a perfect hexagon within a circle, one of the perfect figures. Or, if we unite these six p oints in another way, we have the double equilateral triangle, in union with the symbol of \"a point within a circle.\" This was one of the most sacred of all the emblems of Pythagoras, and is also known even to this day thro ugh the whole East, and has been there revered for ages, as the S EAL OF K ING S OLOMON , by the power of which he bound fast the genii and other spirits who rebelled against God. (See \"A ra- bian Nights,\" and the story of the \"Fisherman and t he Genius\" for an expression of this belief.)

The holy palace itself wa s a perfect cube, being twenty cubits each way (2 Chron . 3:8). According to the teachings of Pythagoras, also, the cube was the most sacred of all the perfect bodies.

One of the most expressive and beautiful emblems of the fellow-craft degree is the representation of \"ears of corn hanging by a waterford,\" or, as the emblem is also often represented, \"a sheaf of wheat suspended near the b ank of a river.\" (See Sickles's Monitor,\" page 90.) What i s the meaning of this emblem? SHEAF OF WHEAT HANGING BY A RIVER A. Dr. Oliver devotes the whole of Chapter XIX of h is \"Land- marks\" to the consideration of this emblem. It appe ars that there is, or was, some confusion as to its true mea ning. Some old masons seem to think it refers to the first passage of the river Jordan by the Israelites under Joshua, when t hey entered Canaan; at which time the promised land was covered over by fields of ripe corn, which was by them then assumed as a sym- bol of the PLENTY which gladdened the hearts of the famished Israelites after their forty years' wandering in th e desert. Another interpretation of the symbol, which Dr. Oli ver gives in full, refers to a passage in the life of Jephthah, recorded in Judges xii, by which we learn that the Ephraimites quarreled with him, A bloody battle followed, and the Ephraim ites were defeated. Jephthah took possession of the passages of the 153"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy Jordan to prevent their escape. When any of the fug itives attempted to cross over, they were commanded to say \"shibbo- leth,\" but, as they could not frame to pronounce it right, and said \"sibboleth,\" they were discovered and slain, to the num- ber of forty-and-two thousand. This latter interpre tation Dr. Oliver thinks to be the true one. He says, Such is the historical account of the warfare of Je phthah with the Ephraimites, and the reputed origin of the sym- bol and its interpretation, because the battle took place in afield of corn near the river Jordan. The interpretation which refers it to the passage o f the river under Joshua has been generally discarded by masons, and is not countenanced by the masonic lecture as g iven in America. The other interpretation, which refers thi s emblem to the battle with the Ephraimites, is, however, also manifestly incorrect, for the following reasons: 1. There is no history of this battle outside of the B ible and Josephus, and neither account makes any mention of the battle having taken place \"in a field of corn.\" Josephus does not even mention the use of the word \"shibboleth.\" (See Judges xii, and \"Antiquities,\" Book V, Chapter VI.) The truth is, the statement that the battle \"took place in a fiel d of corn\" is purely imaginary, and was invented to make out the interpre- tation, which otherwise would not explain \"the ears of corn,\" which constitute the leading and most expressive fe ature of the emblem. It is but another instance of an interpretation being invented to explain an emblem, the true meani ng of which was lost. 2. This interpretation is also clearly incorrect, from the fact that it has no sort of connection with any other pa rt of masonry, or any masonic event or person whatever. I t refers to a period long before the building of Solomon's temp le, and is utterly out of harmony with the entire system of Fr eemasonry and all its details. 154"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Chapter 7.

Sibola Q. What is the probable true meaning of the emblem of \"ears of corn hanging by a water-ford,\" or \"a sheaf of wh eat sus- pended near the bank of a river?\" A. A reference to the Eleusinian Mysteries will go far to clear up the matter, and give us the true import of this symbol. The Eleusinian Mysteries were derived from those of Isis (see initial chapter), who was known to the Greeks by the name o f Ceres, and also Cybele. Ceres, or Cybele, was the goddess of the har- vest, and was represented, like the beautiful virgi n of the zodiac, bearing spears of ripe corn. Isis was in li ke manner, with the Egyptians, emblematic of the harvest seaso n. In the Egyptian zodiac Isis occupied the place of Virgo, a nd was rep- resented with three ears of corn in her hand. The Syrian word for an ear of corn is sibola, ident ical with shibboleth, which the Ephraimites pronounced, more nearly correct, \"sibboleth.\" This word also means \"a stream of water,\" and the emblem of ears of corn or a sheaf of wheat near a watercourse, or river, was one of the emblems of th e Eleusin- ian and Tyrian (or Dionysiac) Mysteries. As the wor d had a double meaning, the picture formed a sort of rebus. The river is the river Nile, the overthrow of which enriched the soil and brought forth the abundant harvests of Egyptian cor n, all of which was symbolically represented by the ears of c orn hang- ing by a river. It is also worthy of remark that th e name of the goddess Cybele, although differing in orthography, is almost 155"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy identical in sound with sibola in some dialects. This mystic word is therefore a triple pun, and has a threefold significa- tion: a. An ear of corn; b. A stream of water, referring to the Nile, upon t he inundation of which the harvest depended; c. It might be understood as one of the names of th e goddess of the harvest. Hutchinson, a masonic writer of note, admits that t he use of the word sibboleth was equivalent to an avowal of a profes- sion of the Mysteries, as it implies ears of corn. (\"Spirit of Masonry.\") How much more perfect and beautiful is this interpr etation of the emblem, and how much more in harmony with th e moral teachings of our order! The one explanation r ecalls nothing to the mind but the bloody and brutal butch ery of forty-two thousand of his fellow beings by Jephthah, the vile wretch who offered up his own innocent daughter as a burnt- offering (see Judges 11:29-40); the other reminds u s of the peaceful pursuits of agriculture, and the benevolen ce of the G REAT C REATOR , who each year brings forth the harvest in due season, and rewards with \"plenty\" the industry of the hus- bandman. The improbability of the operative masons of the middle ages having invented this astronomical-agric ultural emblem is so plain as to require no comment. 156"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Chapter 8 A STRONOMICAL E XPLANATIONS ( CONTINUED ) C ONTINUING THE EXPLANATION of the relationship between the symbols of Christianity, F ree- masonry, and ancient astronomy: The Pillars of the Porch Q.

Speaking of these, the Rev. Dr. W illiam Smith, in his Dictionary of the Bible, says: The Phoenician architects of Solomon's temple deco- rated the capitals of the columns with \"lily-work,\" that is, with the leaves and flowers of the lily, corres ponding to the lotus-headed capitals of Egyptian architectu re. The same writer also says in the same work: The pomegranate was early cultivated in Egypt: henc e the complaint of the Israelites in the wilderness o f Zin (Num. 20:5), this 'is no place of figs, or of vines , or of pomegranates.' The tree, with its characteristic ca lyx- crowned fruit, is easily recognized on the Egyptian sculptures. (See article \"Pomegranate.\") PILLARS OF THE PORCH The description of the pillars, as given in the Bible, also renders it probable that they had no globes upon th e top of their capitals, as none are mentioned. This idea of surmount- ing the pillars with globes arose, no doubt, from a miscon- struction of the word \"pommels, \"as used in 2 Chron. 4:12-13, or the word \"bowls,\" in 1 Kings 7:41. That these po mmels, or bowls, were not in any sense academic globes, such as adorn the masonic columns, is evident from the fact that they were covered with \"network,\" containing four hundred pom egran- 158"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. Astronomical Explanations (Continued) ates in two \"rows, or wreaths\" (1 Kings 7:41-42; 2 Chron. 4:12-13). The chapters, of which these pommels or b owls formed a part, were also adorned with lily-work: Th ese pom- mels must, therefore, have been something entirely different from our modern celestial and terrestrial globes. I n place of bearing representations of the \"various seas and co untries of the earth,\" and \"the face of the heavens,\" they wer e \"covered\" by wreaths of network, lilies, and pomegranates. Th ey were not, in fact, globes of any kind, according to Dr. Smith, who says the word pommels \"signifies convex projections belonging to the capitals of pillars.\" The globes that surmount the masonic columns are, o n the contrary, modern academic globes, for we find them thus described in the \"Monitor\": The Globes The globes are two artificial spherical bodies, on the convex surface of which are represented the countri es, seas, and various parts of the earth, the face of t he heavens, the planetary revolutions, and other impor tant particulars (\"Monitor\"). It is very evident that no such globes as these cou ld have ever been placed on the top of the pillars of the p orch of Solomon's temple even had the sacred text left any doubt upon the subject. Dr. Mackey very truly remarks, in speaking of the symbolical form of the lodge, that \"at the S olomonic era, the era of the building of the temple at Jerusalem, the world was supposed to be of an oblong form.\" Such was the idea held by the most enlightened among the Jewish natio n, even down to a very late date, comparatively. Thus, Isai ah (11:12) says, \"The Lord shall gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth\"; and we find in the Apoca- lypse (20:9) a prophetic vision of four angles stan ding on the four corners of the earth.

If, therefor e, the archi- tect of that age had desired to surmount either of these pillars with a figure representing the earth, he would have placed there a body having the form of a double cube, with the \"countries, seas, and various parts of the earth\" d epicted on its flat upper surface. The same remarks will apply to any repre- sentation then made of the \"face of the heavens,\" w hich, according to the ideas of that age, \"was coextensiv e with the earth taking the same form and inclosing a cubical space, of which the earth was the base, and the heavens, or s ky, the upper surface.\" (Dudley, quoted by Dr. Mackey in no te to page 104) It is, therefore, beyond all question that the intr oduction of our modern academic celestial and terrestrial globe s, as the principal feature and leading ornament of these col umns, was not derived from the pillars at the porch of King S olomon's temple. The custom, however, of placing two lofty c olumns before the porch of temples dedicated to the worshi p of the heavenly bodies, was a very ancient and universal o ne. The Egyptian temples were always decorated by such pill ars. They may have also ornamented, and probably did sometime s orna- ment, these pillars with spheres or globes placed o n their tops, and intended to represent the one the orb of the su n, or Osiris, the other the full moon of the equinox, or Isis. That the Phoenician artists who constructed the pil lars at the porch of King Solomon's temple also imitated th e architec- ture of the Egyptians in this, is possible, althoug h no mention is made of the fact in either Kings or Chronicles. Such spheres, however, would be something very different from tho se upon the masonic columns. That the pillars of the porch may have been surmounted by figures globular in form, and in tended to 160"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. Astronomical Explanations (Continued) represent respectively the sun and moon, is rendere d some- what probable from the fact that the whole construc tion of the temple, as we have seen from what Josephus says, wa s emblematic of the entire universe. That these colum ns partook of this symbolism, and were emblematic in some way of the sun and moon, would seem to be indicated by their v ery names. One of them was called \"Boaz.\" This word is derived from two roots, \"bo,\" motion, haste; and \"az,\" fire, i.e., the sun, the great moving fire. The other was called \"J achin,\" which clearly refers to the moon. Our word \"month\" is derived from the word \"moon\"—a month being one moon, or one rev- olution of the moon. The Hebrew months were also lu nar, hence they called them Jachin, which comes from Jarac, which means the moon (Dr. Adam Clarke). This connection of the globes on the columns, Jachi n and Boaz, or the columns themselves, with the moon and the sun, seems to have been at one time fully acknowledged, if not understood, by the fraternity. This connection was no doubt accepted from ancient tradition, while the true cau se and real meaning of it was probably lost. The following is a drawing of the two pillars of the porch, taken from a masonic medal struck in 1798, which is but a copy of the way thes e pillars are represented in the more ancient charts. It will be observed that above the pillar Jachin the figure of the moon is s een, while above that of Boaz the sun appears. (See \"Macoy's C yclopae- dia,\" article \"Medals.\") As to which pillar properly represents Jachin and w hich Boaz, it must be remembered that, when standing in front of them, they are reversed, Jachin then being on the l eft hand, and Boaz on the right. In this matter much confusio n exists in the pictorial representations made in the Monitors. Kings and Chronicles say that the right pillar was Jachin, an d the left Boaz, and the confusion arises as to whether you ar e supposed to be going into or coming out of the temple. Josep hus, how- ever, makes this plain, for, in locating \"the table with loaves 161"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy PILLARS OF THE PORCH, FROM AN ANCIENT MEDAL upon it,\" he gives the key to the whole matter, and renders it evident that the pillar Jachin was on the south side of the tem- ple, and Boaz on the north.

The true position of the pillars is therefor e shown by the following diagram: THE TRUE POSITION OF THE PILLARS OF THE PORCH Besides this, the Hebrews, like other ancient Orien tal nations, always supposed the spectator looking east , not north, 162"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. Astronomical Explanations (Continued) as we do; hence the word shemal means left as well as north; kedem means east, and also before; while the same word which means south also means at the right hand. When we are told, therefore, in Kings and Chronicles, that the pillar Boaz was on the left side of the temple, it is also implied that it was on the north side. But, as the temple itself fronted to the east, and the pillar Boaz was on the north side of the porch, it also follows that this pillar, which represented th e sun, was placed at the \"northeast corner\" of the temple, and in direct line with the rising sun of the summer solstice, as was the case with the ancient temples of Egypt. The full signifi cance of this will be more clearly seen from the answer to the ne xt ques- tion, as well as the reason why this pillar was pla ced on the north side of the porch and not on the south. It may be thought that, in tracing the primitive me aning of the words Boaz and Jachin to the sun and moon, a co nflict arises with what is stated on the margin of both Ki ngs and Chronicles, where Jachin is translated to mean, \"He shall establish,\" and Boaz, \"In it is strength.\" (See 1 K ings 7:21; and 2 Chron. 3:17.) That the words have such a meaning, in a col- lateral sense, there is no doubt, but the allusion is to the fact that the strength and order of nature, the due cour se of the seasons, and the division of day and night, were or dained and established by the solar and lunar orbs. \"And God s aid, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven, to divi de the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years\" (Gen. 1:14). The word \"strength \" is also applied to the sun in many places (see Psalm xix, w here the sun is compared to \"a strong man, rejoicing to run a race\"). The allusion of the words Jachin and Boaz to 2 Sam. 7:16, \"And thine house and thy kingdom shall be establish ed for ever before thee\" (Simons's \"Monitor,\" page 66), as given in the fellow-craft lecture, has no foundation other t han the fancy of the inventor. The \"house\" spoken of in Samuel is not the temple, but the royal house, or line of David, just as we now 163"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy speak of the house of Brunswick, or the house of Ha psburg. It must be remembered, also, that the marginal notes i n Kings and Chronicles are really no part of the sacred tex t, being sup- plied by the commentators. The promise made to David is, however, directly all uded to in Psalm 89:35-37: Once have I sworn by my holiness, that I will not l ie unto David. His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. It shall be establishe d for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heav en. Here the connection between the sun and moon, and t he ideas of strength and establishment, is directly al luded to, and the symbolism of the pillars of the porch, as repre senting the sun and the moon, might be appropriately made to re fer to the promise made to David. The attempt, however, to mak e a con- nection between the marginal notes to Kings and Chr onicles, and the text from Samuel, and then to apply them bo th to the temple, has no foundation in the Bible. The words J achin and Boaz are simply the names given to these pillars. T hey mean the moon and the sun, and also strength and establi shment, alluding to the respective offices of the sun and t he moon. The Hebrew year was lunar, and the moon established yea rs, and months, and weeks; while the sun, \"in whom is stren gth,\" ruled and divided the seasons. The primitive allusi on of the words to the sun and moon is direct. This symbolism , as we have seen by what Josephus says, is in perfect harm ony with that which characterized the whole temple, and all parts of it alike. This solar and lunar symbolism of the pillar s of the porch was, no doubt, intended to teach the Israelit es that the sun and moon were thus to be regarded as emblems on ly of the great Creator, and not to be worshipped themsel ves as gods.

Cross acknowledges that he invented some emblems, but he also says that many of them had been described before hi s time. In attempting to depict these, he made many mistakes, from his want of a more intimate knowledge of the symbolism of the ancient Mysteries. It is true that the Hebrews, and most of the nation s at the time of the building of Solomon's temple, did not k now the true figure of the earth, yet there is no doubt tha t the Egyp- tians were more learned on this point. This, howeve r, while it concedes the Egyptian origin of the globes, does no t help the matter, for our academic globes, such as are now placed on the pillars, are philosophical instruments of a muc h more recent date. Apart from this, there can be no doubt that the idea of placing two columns before the temple, howe ver they may have been ornamented was derived from Egypt, wh ere it was the custom, as is not only proved by Herodotus and other historians, but by the temples themselves, remainin g to this day, What was the real meaning and true office of t hese pillars standing before the ancient Egyptian temples, will more fully appear from the answer to the next question. Brother Robert Macoy, in his \"Cyclopaedia,\" express es the opinion that the columns Jachin and Boaz were facsimiles of the obelisks which stood before the Egyptian temple s (see article \"Obelisk\"). This, of course, does away with the globes, as well as the lily, pomegranate, and network.

Why is, or ought to be, the first stone of any b uilding laid in the northeast corner? A. The ancients believed that the movements, conjun ctions, and position of the heavenly bodies influenced not only the destiny of nations, but of individuals, and regulat ed all the affairs of life. Their temples were dedicated to th e worship of the sun, and the whole process of their erection, f rom the lay- ing of the first stone up to their completion, as w ell as all the details of the architecture, had special reference to astrological conditions, and the movement of the sun in the zodi ac, or his position at stated periods therein. In our attempt to account for the reason why the co rner- stone was laid in the northeast corner, we will, of course, have, in the first place, to resort somewhat to con jecture, as no record of the reason is left; but if by so doing, w e finally arrive at a theory, not only in entire harmony with the fa cts of astronomy, but also with what is known of the peculiar cus- toms and religious ideas of the ancients, and which , at the same time, gives a reasonable and sufficient cause, according to the same, for the custom itself, we may feel alm ost certain that the truth has been discovered. The cornerstone, we know, was always laid by the ancients with impressive ceremonies and solemn reli gious rites. As an illustration and confirmation of this statement, the following passage is here transcribed from Tacitus, descriptive of the laying of the cornerstone of the Capitol at Rome, when it was rebuilt by the Emperor Vespasian: The care of rebuilding the Capitol he committed to Lucius Vestinus, a man of equestrian rank, but in c redit and dignity among the first men of Rome. The soothsay- ers, who were convened by him, advised that the ruins of the former shrine should be removed to the marsh es, and a temple raised on the old foundation, for the gods would not permit a change in the ancient form. 166"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. Astronomical Explanations (Continued) On the eleventh day before the calends of July, the sky being remarkably serene, the whole space devote d to the sacred structure was encompassed with chaple ts of garlands.

Then the ves tal virgins in procession, with a band of boys and girl s, whose parents, male and female, were still living, sprin- kled the whole place with water drawn from living fountains and rivers. Helvidius Priscus, the praeto r, pre- ceeded by Plautius AElianus, the pontiff, after pur ifying the area by sacrificing a swine, a sheep, and a bul l, replacing the entrails upon the turf, invoked Jupit er, Juno, and Minerva, and the tutelar deities of the e mpire, praying that they would prosper the undertaking, an d with divine power carry to perfection a work begun by the piety of man; and then Helvidius laid his hands upon the wreaths that bound the foundation stone an d were twined about the cords; at the same time the m ag- istrates, the priests, the senators, the knights, a nd a number of citizens, with simultaneous efforts, prom pted by zeal and exultation, haled the ponderous stone along. Contributions of gold and silver, and pieces of other metals, the first that were taken from the mi nes, that had never been melted in the furnace, but in t heir native state, were thrown upon the foundations on a ll hands. The soothsayers enjoined that neither stone nor gold which had been applied to other uses should profane the building. Additional height was given t o the edifice, this was the only variation conceded b y religion. (\"History\" of Tacitus, Book IV, c. 53) From this it appears that the priests and the sooth sayers had the whole control and direction of the ceremony , which was itself of a religious character. This custom wa s derived by the Romans from a more ancient source, and probably from Egypt, where similar solemn rites were celebrated o n like occasions.

As the temples always faced the east, so as to catch the first rays of the rising s un, it is almost certain that the cornerstone also, for like religio us reasons, would be laid in a line with the rising sun. The su n, as he arose on the longest day of the year, rejoicing in his pride and strength, would thus be a type of the new temple ab out to rise majestically from its foundations. On the contrary, to lay the cornerstone of the new solar temple in the southeas tern line of the sun's decline and fall, at the winter solstice, or toward the north, the point of darkness, or yet toward Amenti, the west- ern region of gloom and death, would, according to the teach- ings of astrology, be most unpropitious, if not sac rilegious. It therefore of necessity followed that, as the sun on the 21st of June rises in the northeast, and as the fut ure temple itself faced the east, its cornerstone, if placed s o as to emblem- atically represent and mark the place of the rising sun of the summer solstice, must have been laid in the northea st corner. In the preceding diagram Fig. 1 will clearly illust rate this. The dotted line shows the path of the sun from sunrise to sunset on the 21st day of June, or summer solstice. The ho rizontal cir- cle represents the visible horizon. At this period of the year the sun rises in the northeast and sets in the nort hwest, as rep- resented by the dotted line, where the respective p oints of sunrise, noon and sunset are each marked. This draw ing also clearly shows the reason why that is the longest da y in the year, as it is evident that the circuit from the po int of sunrise, by the way of the south to that of the sunset, is g reater than at any other time. This custom of laying the cornersto ne so as to mark the place of the rising sun of the summer sols tice was productive of other useful astronomical purposes; f or, due care being taken to establish the proper angle, the southeast 169"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy corner would, as a necessary consequence, be in an exact line with the point of the horizon at which the sun rose at the win- ter solstice. At that period the sun rises in the south east and sets in the southwest (see Fig. 2). This is the sho rtest day of the year, for, as will be seen, the path of the sun fro m the point where it rises to where he sets, by way of the sout h, is shorter than at any other period. Another consequence follo wed from this arrangement; for, after the sun quits the sout h and goes north, when he arrives at the vernal equinox he has journeyed half the distance to the other tropic, and rises at a point due east. At the period of the vernal equinox, the sun rose at a point directly in front of the center of the princi pal entrance of the temple, which in Egypt was always surmounted by the sculptured symbol of a \"winged globe, \" emblematic of the sun, whose motion was symbolized by the wings. The same result would also take place when the sun returned from the summer solstice and reached the a utumnal equinox. This is illustrated by Fig. 3. The points marked A and B are those where the sun rises at the summer and win ter sol- stice. It is thus apparent that the porch or front of the temple, from its position and construction, might be used a s a perpet- ual almanac, as the return of the sun to either equ inox would be indicated by his rising in a direct line with th e \"winged globe,\" sculptured above the principal entrance; an d in like manner his arrival at the solstitial points was mar ked by the northeast and southeast corners of the porch. The correct marking of the solstitial points in thi s manner was, however, dependent upon a certain proportion (quite easy to determine) between the breadth of the front of the tem- ple and a point established back of its center, at such a distance that two lines drawn from that point through corner s would cut off the same number of degrees, measured on the horizon, as actually separated the points where the sun rose on the 21st of June and the 21st of December, thus making the f ront of the temple the chord of an arc of the same number of degrees 170"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Chapter 8.

In the latitude of Egypt, Rome, Greece and Asia Min or, if this point so established was desired for any reaso n, to be placed at or near the center of the ground floor of the temple, it would be necessary to build the temple in the fo rm of an \"oblong square\" and in many places the exact form of a ''dou- ble cube\" would be required.

C D represents the front of the temple; the star indicates the point from which the imaginary or act ual lines; as the case may be, are required to be drawn; so as to intersect the points A and B, by passing through the corners of the tem- ple, thus making the front the chord of an arc, containing the same number of degrees as A G B. The other letters indicate the points of the compass. By the use of a \"plumbli ne\" a point corresponding to the star might, if required, be es tablished on the roof. This, however, would not be necessary if, as was generally the case, the principal entrances of the temple con- ducted into an open court, ornamented by rows of pi llars. The whole arrangement, if correctly inaugurated by plac ing the cornerstone in its true position, in the northeast corner, would enable an observer, by use of the most simple and p rimitive instruments, to determine when the sun reached eith er of the equinoctial or solstitial points; or, in other word s, enabling him to divide the year into its four great natural divi sions, and accurately mark the commencement of each. The length of the solar year could also thus be det er- mined—that is, full as accurately as the ancients d id determine it. All of these particulars might, indeed be ascer tained without any instruments whatever, by means of the pillars at the porch. All ancient temples had two lofty pillars, one at e ach corner of the porch, and there is no doubt that they had some connec- tion with the arrangement above described. If they wee located with care, the rising sun of the summer sol stice would cast the shadow of the northeastern pillar, Boaz, along the line A (see Fig. 4), and the rising sun of the winter sols tice cast the shadow of the other pillar, Jachin, along the line B . Careful observations would also probably be made of the length as well as direction of these shadows at dif ferent peri- ods of the year, for at noon on the day of the summ er solstice the sun, being higher in the heavens than at any ot her time in the year, the shadows of the columns would be short est; and 172"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. Astronomical Explanations (Continued) at noon on the winter solstice the shadows would be the long- est. These observations of the length of the shadow s, being made at noon, would be free from the error occasion ed by refraction at sunrise, and thus serve to correct th e others. If these pillars were thus secretly used by the pri ests for astronomical purposes, it fully accounts for the id ea always entertained, but never entirely understood, that th e pillars themselves had some connection, actual or emblemati c, with the solstial or equinoctial points. The following d rawing will clearly illustrate the probable astronomical uses o f the pillars of the porch in ancient Egyptian temples. The sun i s rising. It is the hour of the morning sacrifice. The pavement of the tem- ple is represented as open to the sky, for the purp ose of more easy illustration. It need not have been so in fact , as it is only required that the shadow of the column at sunrise s hould fall parallel to the solstitial line, which could have b een deter- mined from without. In the ancient Egyptian temples , how- ever, the portico and courts leading to the sanctua ry were open and uncovered (see Wilkinson's \"Ancient Egypti ans\"), and the shadows of the columns were projected on th e floor. The Checkered Floor Whenever it was considered necessary to have the so lstitial lines or the length of the shadow actually marked o n the floor, then a certain carefully placed line or row of \"mos aic squares\" (see illustration) would answer the purpose, and al so perfectly conceal the design of the whole arrangement; and th is is prob- ably the reason why the priests in their temple arc hitecture adopted that kind of pavement. Of course, the detai ls of the arrangement were modified to suit different pla ces and circumstances. The observations might be made from the roof, or st anding in front of the temple, where instruments, simple i n construc- tion, for determining the line of direction toward the rising sun, with reference to the front of the temple, mig ht be, and 173"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy THE RISING SUN OF THE SUMMER SOLSTICE probably were, used, without relying wholly on the shadows cast by the columns. The mean daily rate at which t he point of sunrise moved along the horizon, and the length of the shad- ows increased or diminished, would also soon be det ermined, and thus an observation could be taken at sunrise, noon, and sunset, any day. The month and day of the month cou ld thus be determined at any time with tolerable accuracy. The same arrangement would serve to ascertain the true solar time. Of course, it is now impossible, in the absence of any direct infor- mation, to arrive at all the details of the peculia r arrangement by which these ancient solar observations were made , but the main outline is without doubt correct. It was b ut a more extended application of the principle of the sundia l, by means of which not only the hours of the day but the arri val of the sun at the solstitial and equinoctial points, was d etermined, together with the length of the year and other impo rtant partic- ulars. These methods seem clumsy to us, being famil iar with the wonderful \"instruments of precision\" which mode rn sci- ence possesses; but, in those ancient days, such pr imitive methods were the only ones known, and the accuracy of the results arrived at is a matter of wonder and surpri se. 174"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Chapter 8.

The great importance attached to the ceremony of laying the c ornerstone is thus accounted for. This explanation, although f ounded partly on conjecture, harmonizes so well with all t hat is known as to the religious customs and ideas of the ancien ts, with the facts of astronomical science, and the whole system of solar worship, as to render its truth in the main almost certain. No investigation appears to have ever been made as to the proba- ble connection between astronomy and the porches of ancient temples, beyond the fact, apparent at first sight, that they all face the rising sun; and this is attributed to reli gious ideas wholly, and not at all to scientific ones, although it was the well-known custom of the ancient priests to conceal the facts of astronomical science under religious allegories. Those mysterious structures, the pyramids of Egypt, have been more carefully examined, and are found to have been constructed with direct reference to certain astron omical facts, if not uses. The pyramid of Cheops is placed so cor rectly on the true meridian that the variation of the magneti c needle may be determined by it.

The two were one. Astrology assumes, it i s true, to predict not only eclipses, but the future generally from the position and aspects of the heavenly bodies; but, i n order to make those assumed predictions, it was first requir ed, accord- ing to the rules of astrology itself, to obtain a c orrect knowl- edge of the position and aspects of the sun, moon, and planets. This necessitated, of course, correct astronomical observations, which might be and were put to uses e ntirely scientific and practical by the ancients, as well a s serving as a basis for their pretended predictions of the future . That the pyramids (whatever else they may have been intended for) were not temples, we are perfectly willing to grant, because the only object which has induced th is notice of their astronomical proportions, is to show that is a demon- strated fact that the ancient Egyptians did allow t he most exact astronomical ideas to greatly influence, if not who lly control, their most stupendous works of architecture—works s o gigan- tic in size, and requiring such an expenditure of t ime, treasure, labor, and human life, as to render them the greate st wonder of all antiquity.

The ignorant men, therefo re, under his direction, set no bounds in their own min ds to the power of science, and doubted not that the f utu- rity of the moral world, as well as that of the phy sical, was to be read on the face of the starry heavens. I n this mistaken idea they were not undeceived by the pries ts. In order to perpetuate these ideas, and so increase and preserve their power and influence, all scientific knowledge was locked up in the sacerdotal order and the Myste ries. Astronomical observations were thus of necessity se cretly con- ducted in the temples, and the methods by which the se obser- vations were taken, and the real object of construc tions for that purpose, were securely veiled beneath allegori cal and religious rites and formulas.

In order to escape, they at once all assumed dif- ferent shapes and plunged into the river—Pan, or Ba cchus leading the way. That part of his body which was un der water took the form of a fish, and the other part that of a goat. Pan was the god who presided over the flocks and herds.

Q. Whence is the masonic emblem of the hourglass de rived? A. The hourglass was one of the sacred astronomical emblems of the Egyptians. Clement of Alexandria, wh o gives a description of one of their religious processions, informs us that the singer went first, bearing the symbols of music, and that he was followed by the horoscopus, bearing in his hand an hourglass, as the measure of time, together with a palm- branch, these being the symbols of astrology or ast ronomy. It was the duty of the horoscopus to be versed in and able to recite the four books of Hermes which treat of that science. One of these books describes the position of the fi xed stars; another the conjunctions, eclipses, and illuminatio ns of the sun and moon; and the others their risings and sett ings. The hourglass is, therefore, peculiarly an astronomical emblem of great antiquity. The moral application of this masonic emblem is beautifully given in the \"Monitor.\" The Anchor, the Scythe, and the Rainbow Q. Have the anchor, the scythe, and the rainbow any astro- nomical significance? A. These emblems are only incidentally alluded to i n the lec- tures, and have no particular significance as to an y part of our ancient rites and ceremonies, except in a general w ay. They are all of them emblems which have been for ages th e com- mon property of all mankind, used either \"to point a moral or 182"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. Astronomical Explanations (Continued) adorn a tale.\" The last two are, however, astronomi cal in their inception, as the scythe appertains to Saturn, and the rainbow is not only a celestial phenomenon, but was also on e of the emblems of the Eleusinian Mysteries. The Coffin, Spade, etc. These are all common emblems of mortality, and appe rtain as such to the legends of the third degree. As the astronomical allegory contained in that legend has been fully ex plained and illustrated, these emblems require no further remar k. The Key-Stone, and the Legend of its Loss The emblem of the key-stone, as now exhibited, toge ther with the legend of the lost key-stone, would appear to be of very recent date. They belong to the Mark Master's degree, as given to the American rite. The Mark degree, says D r. Mackey, was taken by Webb from the Scottish rite. Webb, how ever, \"improved the ritual and changed the legend, substituting one of his own invention.\" Another writer informs us th at Webb's Mark degree is founded on the European degree of Ma rk mas- ter mason—\"the sign, token and sacred sign,\" of whi ch are exactly the same as the \"due guard, real grip, and principal sign\" of Webb's degree—although it contains no ment ion of the \"key-stone, \" but in its stead the \"cubic stone.\" The weight of testimony from all sources seems to render it ce rtain that the idea of the \"key-stone\" and the legend connecte d with it, as given in the American degree of Mark master, are wholly the invention of Webb. In making these additions to the legends and symbol s of Freemasonry, Webb, however, was under the necessity of making what he added harmonize with the principal legend of the third degree, as well as that of the Royal A rch; and, in doing so, he unconsciously rendered his new legend and its accompanying emblem capable of the same astronomica l explanation as the original legend, which he desire d to thus more fully illustrate.

The emblem of the key-stone and the legend of its l oss may thus be astronomically explained: The Key-Stone Q. Of what is the key-stone emblematic? A. Of strength, that being the strongest part of an arch, bind- ing the several parts together and thus enabling it to bid defi- ance to the elements. KEY-STONE Q. Has the key-stone any astronomical allusion? A. It alludes to the summer solstice, or key of the zodiacal arch, in close proximity to which it is now seen, a nd where anciently was located the constellation Leo, also t ypical of strength.

Astronomical Explanations (Continued) the summer solstice, exalted to the summit of the zodiacal arch (see zodiacal figure opposite page 92). Q. Are the letters surrounding the circle, with the explanation usually given of them correct? A. As the English language was not spoken at the ti me of the building of King Solomon's temple, either by the He brews or the men of Tyre, the English sentence which these letters are said to imply cannot be anything but a very modern innova- tion. If the circle and its accompanying letters, w hich Webb placed on his keystone, were borrowed from a more a ncient source, he evidently did not know what their true m eaning was, and so invented an explanation of his own. The degree of Master Mark Mason, or Past Master, wh ich was confined to those who had actually presided as masters, while it furnished Webb the groundwork for his new degree, made no mention of the key-stone. It did, however, exhibit the letters H. T. S. T K. S., to which it would appear Webb added a W. and another S., for reasons of his own. It is worthy of remark that the meaning attached to these letters h as varied considerably. Thus, some fifty or sixty years ago, they were explained as forming the initials of the following sentence: He That Was Slain Soared To Kindred Spirits, alluding to the leg- end of the death of H. A. B., as related in Oliver' s Dictionary, and before quoted at length. The reading of the present day is very different fr om this, but the reading is not uniform in all the States of the Union. In some States the letters K. S. are said to stand for key-stone, and in others for King Solomon. Some are of the opi nion that S. S. stand for sanctum santorum; others that the K. T. alludes to Knights Templars. It is evident, however, that t here is no definite limit to this mode of reading the mysterio us letters; for, proceeding on the same principle, we might sup pose them to mean— Safely Keep This Sacred Secret Within Thy Heart; or, Hidden Things We Solemnly Swear To Keep Secret; or, There 185"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy Were Seven Steps To King Solomon's House; or, Knights Tem- plars Should Sacredly Watch The Holy Sepulchre; and thus until our ingenuity or patience is exhausted. And i t is also equally evident that all methods of reading these l etters, which are founded on the idea that they are in any way in itials of English words, must be wrong if the emblem is ancie nt, and can only be right if it is of quite recent and whol ly English or American origin. If, therefore, these letters are o f ancient ori- gin, as arranged in this emblem, we may be quite ce rtain that their real meaning has been entirely lost. If they have any ancient meaning, proper investigation and study mig ht, no doubt, rediscover it; but, as we have no evidence w hatever that they are ancient, it is not worth while to mak e any attempt in that direction. The legend of the loss of the key-stone and its rec overy may, however, be brought into harmony with the prin cipal legend of the third degree, and that of the Royal A rch, and thus astronomically explained. All the legends of F reemasonry relating to the finding of that which was lost, ref er to the eure- sis, or discovery, by finding of the sun-god, whose deat h formed the story of the ceremony of the initiation into the Mysteries. The key-stone is an astronomical emblem of the sun at the summer solstice, or summit of the Royal Arch, after leaving which he is slain, and his body lost among the wint ry signs. The astronomical hieroglyph of the sun , which is marked on the key-stone, makes this solar allusion of its loss and recovery perfectly apparent. It may, therefore, be considered as but another allegory of the loss of the sun duri ng the winter months, and his discovery again at the vernal equin ox. And, as the name of O. G. M. H. A. B. means the sun, as bef ore explained, the astronomical sign of the sun on the key- stone is equivalent to his name being there to mark or desig- nate the stone as appertaining to him. 186"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. Astronomical Explanations (Continued) The Legend of the Lost Word Q. What is the meaning of the masonic legend of the \"lost word\"? A. This legend, as briefly stated by Dr. Mackey, in his \"Sym- bolism of Freemasonry\" (page 300), is as follows: The mystical history of Freemasonry informs us that there once existed a WORD of surpassing value, and claiming a profound veneration; that this word was known to the few, and that it was at length lost, a nd that a temporary substitute for it was adopted. This idea of a mystic, all-powerful \"word\" was an a ncient and widely diffused superstition. Just how this not ion origi- nated has not been handed down to us, either by tra dition or otherwise. It, however, probably came to be enterta ined in the following manner: It is generally known to the profane —i.e., the uninitiated—that those who were admitted to the \"Myster- ies\" were entrusted with a certain sacred word, und er a most solemn pledge not to reveal it to the world; and as the scien- tific knowledge, also secretly imparted to those wh o were ini- tiated, gave those who took the higher degrees the power to work apparent miracles, the ignorant and superstiti ous multi- tude naturally thought, and were perhaps taught to believe, that it was by the use of this \"word,\" so sacredly concealed, that the priests were able to perform all their won derful works. The word was, however, nothing but the \"pass word\" which went with the \"sign,\" by which the initiated could make themselves known to one another. This idea of an al l-powerful word was very prevalent among the Jews, no doubt de rived from their long stay in Egypt. The notion was that this \"word\" consisted of the true name of God, together with a knowledge of its proper pronunciation, and that the fortunate possessor of this knowledge became thereby clothed with supernat ural power—that by the speaking of this word he could pe rform all sorts of miracles, and even raise the dead. Accordi ng to the 187"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy Cabalists, \"as the very heavens shook, and the ange ls them- selves were filled with terror and astonishment whe n this tre- mendous word was pronounced.\" Jewish tradition states that God himself taught Mos es his true name and its correct pronunciation at the \"bur ning bush.\" And they believed that Moses, being thus possessed of the \"W ORD ,\" used it to perform all his miracles, and to confoun d and overthrow Pharaoh and his hosts. The Jews of a later date, seeking to account for the wonderful works of Chris t, asserted blasphemously that he unlawfully entered the \"holy of holies,\" and clandestinely obtained the word used by Moses, which was engraved upon the stone upon which the ark rest ed. The superstition in relation to a wonder working word a lso pre- vailed among the Arabians, who say that King Solomo n was in possession of this \"grand omnific word,\" and by its use subdued the genii who rebelled against God, many of whom Solomon imprisoned by the use of his magical seal, upon which the word, contained in a pentacle, was engrav ed. (See the \"Story of the Fisherman,\" and other tales of th e \"Arabian Nights,\" where this legend is alluded to.) It was from these, and other similar legends thus w idely diffused among the ancient Oriental nations, that t he venera- tion for a particular word arose, together with an earnest desire to obtain it, and a laborious search for it, by ambitious believers in its power. All the magicians, enchante rs, and wonder workers of the East, and the adepts of the W est, were supposed to have, in some mysterious way, become po s- sessed of this \"word,\" and were known to the aspira nts and students of the occult sciences (not yet so fortuna te) by the names of \"masters,\" and the \"word\" was called by th em the \"master's word.\" This ancient superstition seems to have left its impress on our ritual, for the \"word,\" of which we hear so often therein, is assumed to be something more than a mere \"pass-word,\" although we, as masons, now use the ph rase 188"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. Astronomical Explanations (Continued) \"master's word\" in a very different sense from that of the adepts of former times. In former and less enlightened times the possession of the true name of God and its proper pronunciation, or s ome sub- stitute for it, authorized by divine command, were even sup- posed requisite in order to worship him aright; for it was ignorantly thought that, if God was not addressed b y how own proper name, he would not attend to the call, n or even know what the prayers of his worshipers were really addressed to him, and not to Baal, Osiris, or Jupit er; or, if knowing, would indignantly reject them. In the East , to address even an earthly potentate by any other than his own proper, high, and ceremonious title, was considered both ir reverent and insulting. Among the Jews, however, the pronunc iation of the true name was supposed to be followed by such t remen- dous effects that a substitute, for which they believed they had the divine sanction, was enjoined. Accordingly, we find in the Old Testament that, whenever the name of God occurs , the substitute is used instead of the true name. The wo rd substi- tuted is generally \" Adonai,\" or Lord, unless the name follows that word, and then \"Elohim\" is used; as, \"Adonai Elohim,\" meaning, Lord God. From this long continued use of a substi- tute for the real word, the latter, or at least its corr ect pronun- ciation, was thought to be lost. A trace of all thi s is found in our ritual, and, perhaps, furnishes the true reason why a sub- stitute (as Dr. Mackey informs us in the extract we have quoted above from his \"Symbolism\" was adopted. It will be of no use to trace any further the numer ous super- stitions and legends in relation to this fabled \"gr and omnific word.\" Dr. Mackey very justly says in the work befo re men- tioned, that it is \"no matter what this word was, o r how it was lost,\" for we now know that no word can be at present of any use to a mason, except to serve as a \"pass-word,\" t o prove his right to the honors and benefits of some particular masonic body or degree; and for that purpose (apart from co nsider- 189"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy ations of a purely archaeological and historical nature, one word is just as good as another, so long as it is a ppropriate to the time and place, and has been established for th at purpose, either by ancient usages or some competent authorit y. Much learning, however, as might be expected, together w ith persis- tent search, laborious study, and even the practice of magical arts, have been employed in the past ages, and even down to within a few years, to discover the ancient wonder working word by those who believed in its fabled power, or from a motive of historical curiosity desired to obtain it . According to some the sacred Tetragrammaton, or four let- tered name of God in Hebrew, incorrectly pronounced Jeho- vah, was the true word. Others thought that the Heb rew word Jah, the Chaldaic Bul or Bell, or the Egyptian O N or O M , the Hindu A UM , together with various combinations of them all, constituted the \"grand omnific word.\" But as the po ssession of no one of them, nor any possible combination of the m, seems to confer any miraculous powers on the possessor, n either of them can be the correct one according to ancient tr aditions. If there ever was such thing as a \"grand omnific word\" (that is, all-powerful word, from omnificus all-creating), it certainly remains lost to this day, and \"I fear it is for eve r lost,\" for cer- tainly none of the words disclosed, with so much so lemn cere- mony, in certain masonic degrees, confer any supern atural powers on those to whom they are communicated. Q. What astronomical allusion has the ancient legen d of the \"lost word,\" as illustrated in the masonic ceremoni es? A. As the masonic legend of the deposit of the \"wor d\" in a secure and secret place, and its very consequent lo ss, has been already quite fully stated by masonic writers, in works sanctioned by the highest masonic authority, there can be no sort of impropriety in relating it here, for the pu rpose of show- ing its primitive astronomical significance. The le gend is sub- stantially as follows: 190"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. Astronomical Explanations (Continued) Enoch, under the inspiration of the Most High, buil t a secret temple underground, consisting of nine vaults, or arches, situated perpendicularly under each other. A tri- angular plate of gold, each side of which was a cub it long, and enriched with precious stones, was fixed to a stone of agate of the same form. On this plate of gold was engraved the \"word,\" or true-name of God; and this was placed on a cubical stone, and deposited i n the ninth or lowest arch. In consequence of the deluge, all knowledge of this secret temple was lost, together with the sacred and ineffable or unutterable name, or ag es. The lost word was subsequently found in this long- forgotten subterranean temple by David, when diggin g the foundations for the temple, afterward built by Solomon his son. Other versions of this legend ascribe the building of the underground temple, and the deposit therein of the \"word,\" to Solomon, and its discovery to those \"who dug the fo undations of the second temple on the same spot, and connect it with the 'substitute ark' deposited in the same place.\" Both legends, however, agree in stating that the \"w ord\" was buried deep underground, and in the ninth arch, or low- est of them all; that it was lost, and remained \"bu ried in dark- ness\" until it was subsequently found and brought t o light. In ancient times, and according to the mystical the ology of those days; God and the sacred name of God were sup posed to be one and the same. The \"word\" was itself consi dered to be, in some sense, a living, creative power. Thus P lato taught that the divine \"logos,\" or word, was God. But, as we have shown, the sun was by the ancients universally adop ted as the symbol of God, and subsequently confounded with God , so that the various names of God became also solar nam es. The loss of the solar name, therefore, became but anoth er expres- sion of the loss of the sun, or sun-god, in the low er hemi- sphere. Now, let us see how this will harmonize wit h the legend just related.

Another allegorical correspondence is found in the fact that the discovery of the word is made according to the masonic legend, by \"three,\" which agrees perfectly with the number of sings, Aquarius, Pisces, and Aries, and the months January, February, and March, which separate the winter sols tice from the vernal equinox, when, according to the legend o f Hiram, the sun is found, as before explained. The sacred name was engraved on a triangular plate of gold, which, according to astrology, is the solar metal. This triangular plate, according to the Royal Arch legen d, was surrounded by a circle. This triangle within a circ le would therefore correctly represent the diagram of the Eg yptian year, as shown on page 21. But, again, the legend informs us that this triangular plate of gold was fixed to a stone of agate of the same form. Now each month, the ancient astrologers taught, had its appropriate gem: TABLE 2. Jan., the Garnet. July, the Ruby. Feb., the Amethyst. Aug., the Sardonyx. March, the Bloodstone. Sept., the Sapphire. April, the Diamond Oct., the Opal. May, the Emerald Nov., the Topaz. June, the Agate Dec, the Turquoise. The agate, therefore, is emblematic of the month of June, the summer solstice, and the resurrection and exalt ation of the sun. The whole was placed on a cubical stone, but the cube 193"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy was sacred to Apollo, who is identical with Helios, the sun- god. The altar of Apollo at Delos was in the form o f a cube. The symbolism of this legend is therefore perfect i n all of its details—the emblematic correspondence is too absolu te to be accidental. The legend of the lost word is but anot her form of the solar allegory of the death and resurrection of Hiram, and teaches the same lesson. The Masonic Ark The ark was one of the principal features of the Eg yptian Mysteries. Speaking of the religious ceremonies of the ancient Egyptians, Wilkinson says: One of the most important ceremonies was the \"proce s- sion of shrines,\" which is mentioned in the Rosetta Stone, and is frequently represented in the walls o f the temples. The shrines were of two kinds, the one a s ort of canopy, the other an ark, or sacred boat which m ay be termed the great shrine. This was carried with g reat pomp by the priests, a certain number being selecte d for that duty, who supported it on their shoulders by means of long staves passing through metal rings at the side of the sledge on which it stood, brought it in to the temple, where it was placed on a stand or table, in order that the prescriber ceremonies might be per- formed before it. The same is said to have been the cus- tom of the Jews in some of their religious processi ons as in carrying the ark \"to its place, in the oracle of the house, to the most holy place,\" when the temple was built by Solomon. (1 Kings 8. See \"Ancient Egyptians,\" vol. i, page 2 67) Wilkinson also says in his notes to \"Herodotus,\" The same mode of carrying the ark was adopted by the Jews (Joshua 3:12; 1 Chron. 15:2, 15; 2 Sam. 15 :24; 1 Esdras 1:4), and the gods of Babylon as well as o f Egypt were borne and \"set in their place\" in a simi lar manner (Is. 46:7; Baruch 4:4-26). Some of the sacre d boats, or arks, contained the emblems of life and s tabil- ity. which, when the veil was drawn aside, were par tly 194"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. Astronomical Explanations (Continued) seen, and others contained the figure of the divine spirit Nef, or Nou, and some presented the sacred beetle of the sun, overshadowed by the wings of the two figur es of the goddess of Themi, or Truth, which calls to mind the cherubim of the Jews.\" (\"Ancient Egyptians,\" vol. 1, page 270; also, note to Rawlinson's \"Herodotus,\" Book II, Chapters LVIII, L IX) The following drawing is taken from Wilkinson's boo k and represents the Egyptian ark, with the \"sacred beetl e\" overshad- owed by the wings of the double goddess of Truth, c opied from the walls of an ancient Egyptian temple. EGYPTIAN ARK (WILKINSON) The principal difference between the Jewish and Egy ptian arks is that the Egyptian was more like a \"boat\" in shape, according to our ideas of a boat, while the Jewish ark is described as being of an oblong-square form; this, however it may be observed, was the exact form of Noah's \"ark, \" as described by the Jewish Historian in Gen. 6:14-16. The idea of a boat is therefore characteristic of both of these ancient emblems, as, indeed the very name \"ark\" denotes. The above is another view of the Egyptian ark of Os iris, taken from Kitto's \"Cyclopaedia of Biblical Literat ure.\" The heiroglyphics on the side of the ark are the emblem s of domin- ion, stability, and life everlasting, arranged by 3 x 3. This mysterious ark, or chest, which figured in the Myster- ies of Egypt, much more nearly resembled the Jewish ark in form. After Typhon had slain Osiris, 195"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy ARK OF OSIRIS ( KITTO ) he inclosed him in a chest and cast him into the sea, thus plunging all heaven in grief and sadness. Isis , when she learned the melancholy news, refused all consolation, despoiled herself of her ornaments, cu t off her tresses, robed herself in the habiliments of mo urn- ing, and wandered forth through the world. Disconso - late and sorrowful, she travelled into all countrie s seeking the mysterious chest which contained the bo dy of the lost Osiris. In the meanwhile, the chest was drawn ashore at Byblos, and thrown into the center of a bush, which, having grown up into a beautiful tree, had entirely inclosed it. At length, however, the t ree was cut down by a king of that country, and used by him in the construction of a new palace. But Isis f inally learned the singular fate of the chest, and her per se- vering love was rewarded by the possession of it. (\"Philosophical History of Secret Societies,\" by Re v. Augustus C. Arnold) The plant which thus indirectly led to the discover y of the mutilated body of Osiris was held sacred by the Egy ptians. The whole story of the death of Osiris and the find ing of his body is admitted to be an astronomical allegory of the death of the sun-god, slain by Typhon when the sun was in Sc orpio, which was at that time on the autumnal equinox.

Astronomical Explanations (Continued) when the sun was in Scorpio, in the month of Athyr, the Egyptians inclosed the body of their god Osiris in an ark, or chest, and during this ceremony a great annual festival was celebrated. Three days after th e priests had inclosed Osiris in the ark, they preten ded to have found him again. The death of Osiris was lamen ted by them when the sun, in Scorpio, descended to the lower hemisphere; and, when he arose at the vernal equinox, then Osiris was said to be born anew. The use made of the ark, or sacred chest, in certai n masonic degrees, derives no one of its particulars from any- thing narrated in the Bible; on the contrary, it be ars so striking an analogy to the ark of the Egyptian Mysteries as to at once disclose the original from which it was copied. The masonic ark, like that of the Egyptian Mysteries, is lost o r hidden, and after a difficult search at last found. The masonic ark, it is true, does not, like the Egyptian one, contain the body o f the slain sun-god Osiris. It does however, contain something symboli- cally representing the true God, and also certain m atters which, it is claimed, lead to a superior knowledge of him. The analogy is therefore perfect, and the astronomical allegory is strictly preserved. Q. What is the meaning of the emblem of the key? KEY, EMBLEM OF A. This is a very ancient emblem, and formerly allu ded to in the initiation into the Mysteries, which at once un locked to the aspirant all the hidden secrets of religion, and fu rnished him with a key to those allegories and tales under whic h the sub- lime facts of astronomy and other sciences were con cealed from the profane.

ANCIENT EGYPTIAN IRON KEY (FROM THEBES) The preceding is a picture of an ancient Egyptian k ey, from Thebes, and will give a correct idea of the ancient emblem appertaining to the mysteries. The Lion, the Eagle, the Ox, and the Man Q. That is the astronomical allusion of these four ancient emblems, and why are they thus associated together? A. They refer to the four great angles of the heave ns, where the equinoctial and solstitial points are situated, and the signs at these points are, according to ancient astrology , called \"fixed signs.\" Each sign, was, moreover, ruled by three go ds, called Decans, the first of which in each sign was called \"the pow er- ful leader of three.\" The most important and powerf ul of these thirty-six celestial gods were the four Decans, who ruled the four angles of the heavens, and the stability and p erpetuity of the universe were supposed to be insured by them. T hey were also called Elobim, and the two who had their seat on the equator were believed to compel the sun to shine tw elve hours over all the earth, as well as to repel him, so tha t he moved on to the next sign of the zodiac in progressive order . The no less powerful Elohim, or Decans, who ruled the solstitia l points caused the sun to turn back at the tropics, and pre served the order of nature and of the seasons. In all ancient astrological projections of the heav ens, the four great angles of the zodiac, where these celest ial gods were seated, were marked by the figures of the lion , the eagle, the ox, and the man—the constellation Leo being anciently at 198"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. Astronomical Explanations (Continued) the summer solstice; Aquarius, depicted as a man pouring water from a jar, at the winter solstice; and Taurus, the Ox, or Bull, at the vernal equinox; while the other angle, or autumnal equinox, was marked by a flying eagle. The quadrant s of the celestial sphere were also anciently occupied by th e four bright stars Aldebaran, Regulus, Antares, and Fomalhaut. These were called \"royal stars,\" and in them the fo ur great Elo- him were believed to dwell. To them divine honors w ere paid and sacred images erected, in which the lion, the e agle, the ox, and the man were variously combined. These embl ems were worshipped by all ancient nations. The priests and the initiated knew them to be nothing more than astrono mical allegories, emblematic representations of the zodia c, but the superstitious people adored them as real gods. The Jews obtained these four emblems from Egypt. Moses, howe ver, forbade their worship, and taught the Israelites to use them to denote the points of the compass and the divisions of their camp, by means of banners on which they were pictur ed (Numbers 2). These celebrated emblems are therefore of a purely astronomical and zodiacal origin, and, when properly understood (as they were by the initiated), teach m any of the most important facts of astronomical science. The Royal Arch Banner Q. What is the meaning and origin of the device on the Royal Arch banner which is represented below? A.

The cross which divides them is a correc t represen- tation of the equator, cut at right angles by the g reat solstitial colure, The grotesque and imaginary creatures stand ing on each side are also astronomical emblems, being comp ounded of the three figures of the man, the eagle, and the ox—exhibit- ing the face and body of a man, the wings of the ea gle, and the feet of the ox—emblematic of the winter solstic e and the 199"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy autumnal and vernal equinoxes, as before explained. Some are, however, of the opinion that the lower parts o f the figures represent the legs of a goat instead of the ox. Thi s would make them refer to Capricornus, the Goat, which now marks the winter solstice, thus clearly denoting the \"pre cession of the equinoxes,\" in consequence of which the figure of t he man (Aquarius) was changed into that of a goat (Capricornus), as the solstitial point left Aquarius and entered Capricornus. ROYAL ARCH BANNER Capricornus is also identical in mythology with Pan , who is represented as a god, with the body of a man and th e legs of a goat. Astronomical emblems and figures similar to these compound creatures on the Royal Arch banner were qu ite common among the sun-worshipping nations of antiqui ty, and were called sphinxes. The Egyptians, who held the constella- tion Leo in especial reverence, more frequently combined the human figure with that of a lion, to which they som etimes added the wings of the eagle. These were called andro- sphinxes; others, called crio-sphinxes, had the head of a ram, alluding to the sign Aries. The winged Greek sphinxes, com- mon vases, were partly Egyptian and Phoenician. The Assyri- ans more particularly esteemed the constellation Taurus, and therefore generally combined the figure of a bull w ith the head and face of a man, to which the wings of the e agle were always attached. In the Assyrian Museum at the Louvre, M. Botta depo sited a slab taken from the palace of Khorsabad, which is orna- mented with figures almost identical with those on the Royal 200"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Chapter 8.

The heads of these Assyrian sphinxes only differ from those of the banner, in b eing cov- ered by the characteristic Assyrian headdress, and wearing the long ornamented Assyrian beard. Layard also found a mong the ruins of Nimroud, sculptures of monsters with t he head of a lion, the body of a man, and the feet of a bird, which is but a different combination of the same figures, expres sing the same astronomical ideas. It is, therefore, evident that the Royal Arch banner is composed wholly of ancient astronomi cal emblems. The motto, \"Holiness to the Lord,\" is but a proper expression of adoration to the great Creator of the starry heav- ens, which are so graphically represented by the wh ole device. The Number \"Seven\" Q. Why was the number seven held in especial reverence by all the nations of antiquity? A. The mystic number seven was held sacred by our a ncient brethren for reasons which had a purely astronomica l origin. The reasons for this will lead us to inquire into t he origin of the division of time into days, weeks, months, and years. We were naturally induced to divide our time into peri ods called days, because the sun makes his apparent diurnal re volution in that time. The Egyptians used to watch for the h eliacal rising of the dog-star (Sirius), which, like a faithful gu ardian, gave notice of the approaching inundation of the Nile, a period of the greatest importance to them, as their harvests depended upon it. By this means a definite period of time wa s marked off, corresponding to the apparent revolution of th e sun in the zodiac. This period was denominated in a year, a word which, in our language and all northern tongues, whether \"gear, \" \"jaar, \" \"jaer, \" or as in the Persian, \"yare, \"signifies a circle. In Latin, also, the words annus, a year, and annulus, a circle, are synonymous. Thus the very word \"year\" alludes direc tly to the 201"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy great circle of the zodiac, and points out the orig in of that divi- sion of time. This period was further divided by th e revolu- tions of the moon about the earth. These latter sub divisions were naturally called \"moons,\" from which is derive d our word \"month. \"Among the ancient Egyptians the hieroglyphic sign for a month is the crescent of the moon. In th e Hebrew the same intimate connection between the words moon and month exists as in English. It was also still further obs erved, by these early students of the skies, that in each lun ar month that planet assumed in regular order, at fixed periods o f seven days each, four distinct phases—the new moon, the first quarter, the full moon, and the last quarter, the \"month\" wa s therefore divided into four equal parts of seven days each, called weeks. All our divisions of time, whether of days, weeks, months, or years, have therefore an astronomical origin, an d are but measures of the observed motions of the moon, for t he year itself was originally lunar, the solar year having been subse- quently adopted on account of its greater accuracy and conve- nience. The moon, among the nations of antiquity, w as the object of universal adoration. Next to the sun in b eauty and splendor the moon leads all the hosts of heaven. It may be that the awful majesty and solemn silence of that s tarry vault, in the midst of which she is seen, caused her to ap peal more strongly to the imagination of the early Oriental n ations than even the meridian sun itself. It is certain, howeve r, that from ancient Egypt to the distant plains of India, or th ose far-off lands where the Incas ruled, altars were erected to the wor- ship of the moon, and the goddess adored under a mu ltitude of names, with rites as splendid and awful as those instituted in honor of the sun. As on every seventh day the moon assumed a new phas e, therefore on every seventh day a festival to Luna was cele- brated. The number seven was thus sacred because it was ded- icated to the moon. The day set apart for the worsh ip of the moon was known among most northern nations as \"moon- 202"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. Astronomical Explanations (Continued) day\" —whence is derived our name for the second day of t he week, Monday. The first day of the week being in li ke manner set apart to the worship of the sun, called \"sun-day.\" In fact, each day of the week was set apart to the special w orship of some one of the heavenly bodies: Sunday to the sun; Monday to the moon; Tuesday to Mars; Wednesday to Mercury; Thurs- day to Jupiter; Friday to Venus; and Saturday to Sa turn. A strange reminiscence of this fact is found in the m odern names of all the names of the week, each of which, like S unday and Monday, has derived its name from the planet or god to which it was anciently sacred. Tuesday is derived from the Scandinavian name of Mars. The name of the day in French is Mardi, derived directly from the Latin, and meaning \"Mars's day\" Wednesday is from the Scandinavian Mercury, Woden; hence Woden's day, or Wednesday. The French name of this day is Mercredi, from the Latin, meaning \"Mercury's day.\" Our Thursday is from the Scandinavian Jupiter, Thor; hence \"Thor's day,\" and Thursday. The German name i s Don- nerstag, meaning the \"Thunderer's day,\" in allusion to Jupiter Tonans. The French call it Jeudi, meaning \"Jupiter's day.\" Friday is named after the Scandinavian Venus, Fria. The German name is Freitag, with the same derivation and mean- ing. The French call this day Vendredi, which means \"Venus's day.\" Saturday is derived from Latin, and means \"Saturn's day.\" The days of the week may, therefore, be just as wel l desig- nated by the planetary signs as by their names; thu s— TABLE 3. 203"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy It was thus that not only the mysterious changes of the moon and the number of the planets, but also the nu mber and order of their religious festivals, and the whole s ystem of ancient worship, were inseparably and astronomicall y con- nected with the number seven and \"the moon, whose phases marked and appointed their holy days.\" (See Cicero, in the \"Tusculan Disputations,\" Book I, Chapter XXVIII.) I t is, there- fore, a matter of no wonder that this number should have been held in especial reverence by all the nations of antiquity, or that their imagination should have clothed it wi th mysteri- ous and magical virtues. This veneration for the nu mber seven was diffused as widely as the worship of the heaven ly bodies. The moon was adored in all lands alike, and all her motions, especially her weekly phases, observed with superst itious rev- erence. It thus happened that, from similar reasons , the num- ber seven was alike considered sacred by nations wh o had no intercourse, the idea being a spontaneous growth fr om com- mon astronomical causes. The Word \"Seven\" The meaning of the word seven is also indicative not only of the lunar origin of the division of time into pe riods deter- mined by the phases of the moon, but also of the un iversality and identity of the ideas attached to the number it self. The Hebrew word schiba, seven, signifies fullness, or completion. In the Saxon, Persian, Syrian, Arabic, Phoenician, and Chaldean, the word seven has the same signification , and without doubt refers to the moon, which \"fills,\" or becomes \"complete, \"seven days. It is easy to see how a word signifyin g \"filled,\" or \"completed,\" should be adopted to mark the time when the moon should reach its \"full.\" Before that time she had been increasing in size and light, but now she is filled, or completed; and so, by analogy, the same word in tim e was also used to mark each period when the other equall y distinct, phases of the moon reached maturity. 204"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. Astronomical Explanations (Continued) The \"Figure\" Seven Our figures, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., are called the Arabi an numerals because we derive them from the Arabians, who, it i s thought, received them from India. Their true origin is lost in the dim light of extreme antiquity. It is, however, probabl e that, like the zodiacal and planetary signs, they were origina lly hiero- glyphs. Now, as each seventh day, when the moon ass umes a new phase, she has traversed just one quarter of he r orbit, we might naturally expect that the hieroglyphic repres enting the word \"seven\" would, in harmony with the ancient met hod of writing, be \"a right angle, 90°, or one fourth part of a circle.\" And so, indeed, we find it to be, with only such sl ight varia- tion as would necessarily result from a constant us e of ages, after its emblematic meaning was lost, and only its arbitrary signification was retained. For illustration, let t his be the orig- inal hieroglyph, denoting a period of a quarter rev olution of the moon, 90°, and indicating that the moon has \"fi lled,\" or \"completed,\" schiba (seven), one of her phases. The change from to 7 is but slight; is but the natural result of th e difficulty of rapidly, and without instruments, making a correct right angle by the union of two perfectly straight lines, while the lines becoming slightly curved only tended to give the charac- ter a more finished and graceful appearance. TRIPLE TAU Triple Tau This emblem is not adopted in American Freemasonry, but, placed in the center of a triangle and circle, both emblems of the Deity, it constitutes the jewel of the Royal Ar ch as prac- ticed in England, where it is so highly esteemed as to be 205"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy calledthe \"emblem of all emblems,\" and the \"grand e mblem of Royal Arch Masonry.\" The original signification of this emblem has been vari- ously explained. Some suppose it to include the ini tials of the Temple of Jerusalem, T. H. (Templum Hierosolymoe); but, as the tau cross as an emblem is much older than the Temple of Jerusalem, this can not be correct; besides, no oth er evidence is offered for this solution than that the letters T. H. stand for the words \"Templum Hierosolymoe.\" We might just as well conclude that the letters stand for \"Thrice Holy,\" \"Hiram Tyr- ian,\" or the name of any other thing for which the letters T. H. or H. T. may be the initials. Neither is any proof offered to show that the emblem is really composed of the lett ers T and H, instead of three tau crosses united. Others say it is a symbol of the mystical union of the Father and Son, H sign ifying Jeho- vah, and T, or the cross, the Son. A writer in \"Moo re's Maga- zine\" ingeniously supposes it to be a representatio n of three T-squares, and that it alludes to the three jewels of the three ancient grand masters. But these solutions are also suggested without any proofs, while the fact that the tau cross as an emblem antedates the Christian era, effectually dis poses of one of them. It has also been said that it is a mon ogram of Hiram and Tyre, and others assert that it is only a modification of the Hebrew letter shin, which was one of the Jewish abbre- viations of the sacred name. Oliver thinks, from it s connection with the circle and triangle in the Royal Arch jewe l, that it was intended to typify the sacred name as the author of eternal life. The same objection may be made to these conjectures : no proof is advanced by their authors to support them, while the monuments and hieroglyphs of Egypt show that the tau cross was in use as an emblem before the era of Hiram. Dr . Mackey says that, among so many conjectures, he need not h esitate to offer one of his own, and remarks as follows: The prophet Ezekiel speaks of the tau, or the tau cross, as the mark distinguishing those who were to be sav ed, 206"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. Astronomical Explanations (Continued) on account of their sorrow for their sins, from tho se, who, as idolaters, were to be slain, it was a mark or sign of favorable distinction, and with this allusi on we may, therefore, suppose the triple tau to be used i n the Royal Arch degree as a mark designating and separat ing those who know and worship the true name of God from those who are ignorant of that august mystery. This is much nearer the truth, but is not, after al l, any explanation of either the meaning or origin of the emblem itself. It is only a suggestion of the reason why i t may have been adopted by the Royal Arch degree, as being app ropriate to its spirit. Dr. Mackey leaves us in the dark why Ezekiel speaks of it as an emblem of life and salvation: The English Royal Arch Lectures say that \"by its in ter- section it forms a given number of angles that may be taken in five several combinations; and, reduced, t heir amount in right angles will be found equal to the f ive Platonic bodies, which represent the four elements and the sphere of the universe.\" But this, if true, throws no light on the subject. The tau cross, as an emblem in various forms, is found on t he ancient monuments of Egypt, and in order to discover its re al mean- ing, and how it came to be used as a symbol, we wil l have to go back to a period long before the era of King Sol omon. Q. What is the origin and meaning of the triple tau ? A. The triple tau is the ancient symbol of the tau cross, three times repeated and joined at a common center. The tau cross is the same in shape as the Greek letter T, which i s also called tau, and was anciently considered as an emblem of life. It was held to be a sacred mark, and was placed upon the f oreheads of those who escaped from shipwreck, battle, or oth er great peril of life, in token of their deliverance from d eath. This is why the tau is mentioned in Ezekiel (4:4-6) as the \"mark set upon the foreheads of the men\" who were to be prese rved alive. The name by which this emblem is known point s to its 207"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy origin, and also the reason why it is selected as a n emblem of life. The word tau is derived from an Egyptian or Coptic root, meaning a bull or cow, and the constellation ancien tly mark- ing the vernal equinox. This word, with a Latin or Greek ter- mination, is found in both those languages— Taurus (Latin), a bull, and the Tauros (Greek), meaning the same. The ancient hieroglyphic sign of the constellation Taurus and t he vernal equinox is in the form, as an astronomical sign, represent- ing the face and horns of a bull. It is now conside red estab- lished that letters were derived from the ancient h ieroglyphs, and, when the phonetic mode of writing was invented , many of those letters retained the name of the object wh ich the orig- inal hieroglyphs, or pictures, were intended to rep resent. These hieroglyphs, in process of time, assumed a fo rm more and more arbitrary, so much so that, at last, they lost almost all resemblance to the original picture, of which, how- ever, many of them still retained the same. It was thus that the drawing of the face and horns of a bull became a me re out- line, and assuming this form as an astronomical sign. Even this did not remain permanent, for, after it came t o be used as a letter, it happened, either from carelessness or convenience in writing, that the circle representing the face o f the bull became a straight line. The same kind of a change a ppears to have taken place with the original picture of Aries , or the head and horns of a ram; which from the actual picture, became finally like this, its present form as an astronomical sign. It was in just the same way that Taurus, became changed, as shown by Figure 3, after it came into use as a lett er. The next change was as shown by Figure 4, and, finally, the semicircle of the horns, like the circle formerly representing the face, became a straight line also, and the character assu med this form, 208"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. Astronomical Explanations (Continued) These changes may be represented at one view, as fo llows: TAURUS AND TAU CROSS The first of these is the original hieroglyphic pic ture of the head and horns of a bull; the second is the astrono mical sign of Taurus, and, as such, for astronomical purposes has retained that form, probably because so seldom thus used in comparison to its subsequent employment as a letter ; the third shows the transition of the second into the fourth, after it began to be used alphabetically, and is one form of the Greek letter tau; the last is the Greek and Roman capital tau, which is identical to the tau cross. The common name of all these characters, it will be observed, from the first pictorial representation o f the head and horns of a bull, and including the sign is tau, meaning a bull or cow. For the real name is tau, the \"us\" of the Latin and the \"os\" of the Greek being nothing but the usual t ermination characteristic of those languages. The Phoenician n ame of the letter T, according to Rawlinson, is also tau, meaning, however, \"bread\" in that language. But, as the bread is the nourisher and \"staff of life,\" the word is equivale nt to the Egyptian \"giver of life.\" The real meaning and figu rative signifi- cance of the Phoenician word for bread thus becomes at once apparent; it may have had a double as well as a fig urative meaning. Even in the Egyptian the word has a meanin g sug- gestive of agriculture and the raising of grain, ou t of which bread is made, for the Coptic word thour meant a bull, and its verb athor meant to plow.

The letter, or symbol, together with the mythology connected with it, was adopted by the Greeks, perhaps, indire ctly through the Phoenicians, for the Greeks claim to ha ve been taught the letters by Cadmus, a Phoenician. The for egoing is probably the origin of the letter tau, and the peculiar signifi- cance attached to it. Rawlinson, in his notes to \"Herodotus,\" Book V, Cha pter LVIII, holds that the Greeks derived their letters directly from the Phoenicians, for the reason that they are quite similar in form, and that their names all have a significance in the Phoe- nician language of the object which they were origi nally intended to represent; while, on the other hand, th eir names have no meaning whatever in the Greek tongue. In ot her words, he argues that the names of the letters are Phoenician, and not Greek, and that, therefore, the Greeks must have bor- rowed their letters directly from the Phoenicians. This he shows conclusively by the table of letters with the ir names, which he gives. This list of names, however, proves just as conclusively that the Phoenicians themselves did no t invent the letters, but simply translated their names into their own language when they began to use them. The names, tr anslated into English, are as follows: A Bull, A Paling, A Prop, A Tent, A serpent, An Eye, A Camel, A Hand, A Mouth, A door, The Hollow An Axe, A Window of a Hand, A Head A Hook, A Prick-stick, A Tooth, and A Lance water, Bread A Fish, The Phoenicians, it is certain, were a maritime nat ion.

Astronomical Explanations (Continued) certainly would have represented would have been of a marine and commercial nature. We would expect to fi nd ships, boats, sails, ropes, rudders, anchors, chains, oars , and that class of objects. None of these, however, appear; o n the con- trary, the objects are all pastoral or agricultural in their charac- ter, indicative of a people engaged in those pursui ts—a people who used the bull to plow with, and whose commercia l enter- prises were not conducted on the sea by ships. It is another significant and almost conclusive fac t that each and every one of these \"objects,\" except the camel, are found in profusion among the hieroglyphic pictures of the Egyptians, and were in daily and familiar use in all their wri tten inscrip- tions, as we find them on their monuments and sculp tures even to this day. This is true of no other ancient people, and the conclusion becomes irresistible that the Phoeni cians, whose ships and traffic brought them in frequent co ntact with the Egyptians, borrowed of them their letters or de rived them from the hieroglyphics of Egypt. They naturally, an d almost of course translated the names of the various objects and animals represented in the hieroglyphs into their own Phoen ician tongue. This the Greeks, when they in turn borrowed from the Phoenicians, did not do, probably because, when the hiero- glyphs reached them, they had assumed a more arbitr ary form, and one so far removed from the original pictures a s to render any such translation wholly unnecessary, if not imp ossible. That the Phoenicians, a people preeminent for their inge- nuity and skill, greatly improved on the Egyptian m ethod, and reduced the hieroglyphs to a more strictly alphabet ic and arbi- trary form and use, is highly probable, if not cert ain; but that the originals of the letters, together with their n ames, first came from Egypt, is also just as certain. The improvemen ts which the Phoenicians made in the art of writing by lette rs was, no doubt, as much due to the fact that they were free from certain religious obligations, which hampered an advance in that 211"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy direction by the Egyptians, as to their own charact eristic inge- nuity and national aptitude for scientific pursuits . It may be urged, as an objection to our derivation of the letter tau, that, in the Phoenician and Hebrew alph abets, the letter A is named aleph, meaning a bull. The Greeks, also, called the letter A alpha, adopting the Phoenician name. But the sound of A is also represented in the Egyptian hieroglyph s by the tau cross. The very fact, therefore, that th e Phoenician letter A was named a bull, shows that the Egyptian tau cross had a name with a similar meaning, and did represent not only a bull, but specifically the sacred bull calle d Apis, which, according to the Egyptian system, gave it the sound of the let- ter A, for the use of the hieroglyph as a letter fo llowed the first sound of the name of the object represented. It als o shows that the allusion of the tau cross of Egypt was to the vernal equinox, and the constellation of the bull thereon, for which reason it was an emblem of life and a return to lif e. Apis was the name of the sacred bull, under which emblematic form the Egyptians worshipped Osiris, the sun-god. In the Chaldaic alphabets it is the letter T which is said to have been originally represented by a bull In the a lphabet of Cadmus the letter T is a cross, similar to another of the Egyp- tian signs for the letter A. Now, if all these alph abets were in fact originally derived from the hieroglyphics of E gypt, this is just the sort of confusion which we would naturally expect to exist respecting the name and form of the letters T and A among the earlier alphabets of other nations, who t ranslated the names into their own language, and began to use them on the Egyptian system, and according to the initial s ounds of those names. In some of these alphabets the letter A, while it l ost the form of the cross, retained the name of a bull, as no distinction would naturally be made by other nations between th at partic- ular bull named Apis, sacred to the Egyptians only, and a bull generally. 212"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. Astronomical Explanations (Continued) In other alphabets both the name and form might be retained, but the name being translated into anothe r language, the letter might be used as the symbol of another s ound.

Such changes as these would cause the hieroglyphic sign of the bull to represent in some languages the sound of T in pl ace of that of A. CRUX ANSATA, EMBLEM OF ETERNAL LIFE (EGYPTIAN) The specific ancient Egyptian \"emblem of eternal life,\" however, does not appear to have been adopted in it s com- plete form by other nations—that is, as a letter. I ts form was abbreviated, although its symbolical meaning was re tained to some extent. The Egyptian symbol of eternal life, i n its unabridged form, is as below, and was known in late r times as the \"Cruz Ansata.\" As will be seen, it is nothing more than the \"tau cross\" surmounted by a circle, sometimes made some- what oval in shape. The entire hieroglyphic was pro bably originally the picture of the head and horns of a b ull, sur- mounted by the orb of the sun, thus expressing in a still more direct and specific manner the sun in Taurus. It was thus they were accustomed to represent Apis. This symbol, from its constant use at first as a sacred emblem, and finally, as a letter, or hieroglyphic, would natura lly assume more and more of an arbitrary form. The face and ho rns of the bull would gradually take the shape of a cross, as before 213"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy described, and the orb of the sun which surmounted it lose somewhat its perfect circular form. The whole hiero glyph would thus finally assume an arbitrary form, like t hat here rep- resented. If this conjecture be correct, it fully e xplains why this peculiar symbol denoted among the Egyptians eternal life— the reason for which, according to both Wilkinson a nd Ken- drick, has as yet remained in obscurity. (See Kendr ick's \"Ancient Egypt,\" vol. i, page 254; Wilkinson's \"Anc ient Egyp- tians,\" vol. 1, page 277.) GODDESS OF TRUTH AND JUSTICE HOLDING CRUX ANSATA (WILKINSON) This Egyptian emblem was subsequently named the Crux Ansata, or \"cross with a handle,\" because it was thought th e circle was nothing more than a handle for the purpo se of car- rying the cross.

The following cut shows the \"sign of life\" held by the lower end, in the hand of the double goddess of Truth and Justice . The idea advanced by some, that it is a key, derive s little or no support from the monuments; besides this, the Eg yptian form of a key was entirely different, as is seen fr om the draw- ing which accompanies our explanation of the masoni c emblem of \"the key.\" The Crux Ansata was adopted by the early Christians of the East as an appropriate symbol of their faith.

(Wilkinson) Among the ancients the cross in this form, , was also consid- ered a sacred emblem, as it pointed to the four qua rters of the heavens, and embraced both the celestial and terres trial hemi- spheres. It was thus a symbol of the universe, and expressive of the perpetual life and endless duration of natur e. The Rosi- crucians also taught that this form of the cross wa s the symbol of light, because it contained in its formation the ancient Roman letters LVX, lux, the Latin word for light. Whether this beautiful conceit was invented by them or derived f rom ancient sources is unknown. The tau cross, is as has been shown, an ancient sym bol of Egypt denoting salvation and eternal life. The trip le tau, being a combination of the tau cross three times repeated, teaches us that \"we have an immortal part within us that shall survive the grave, and which shall never, never, NEVER die\" (Masonic Lecture). The Astronomical Triple Tau Q. Has the triple tau any further astronomical sign ification? A. It has—for, when the geometrical principles upon which it is erected are analyzed, it will be found to repres ent, symboli- cally, the Royal Arch, together with its three prin ciple points, and many other astronomical particulars. In order t o explain this more fully, let us draw out on our \"trestle-bo ard\" a triple- tau. We will first draw the line A B (see the following diagram), representing the great equinoctial colure ; on this describe a semicircle, and erect the Royal Arch (se e illustration on page 69). Next distinguish the two equinoctial p oints by two parallel lines, in the same manner as the solst itial points are marked in the emblem of \"a point within a circl e\" (see page 130).

The lines at the extremiti es of A B are perpendicular to it, and in a properly drawn triple tau the lines M N, O P, and K L, are all equal to each other, and equal to the radius of the circle which may be inscribed within them. The radius of any circle is one sixth of its circumfere nce, and, therefore, is a chord of an arc of 60°. It therefore follows that the line K L is divided by the perpendicular C D into two parts, each of which represents 30°, or one sign of the zo diac.

This emblem would be more properly known under the name of the quadruple tau.

With the exception of these, all the other ancient symbols have been found to have an astronomical origin and meaning. It is also a strong confirmation that no contradict ion exists among them when thus explained. The separate astronomical explanation of each one of them is in perfect harmony, not only with all the others, but also with the main ce ntral allegory of the annual passage of the sun among the stars of the zodiac, his death during the winter months, his ret urn to life at the vernal equinox, and his exaltation at the summe r solstice. The Words \"Mystery\" and \"Masonry\" Q. Is there any connection between the words \"myste ry\" and \"masonry\"? A. If, in fact, the masonic institution, as Mackey and Oliver both admit, was descended from the ancient \"Mysteri es,\" there should be some close connection between the words \" mys- tery\" and \"masonry,\" even if the latter is not dire ctly derived from the former. The word \"mystery,\" which original ly had an exclusive meaning, came in process of time to have three dif- ferent meanings, all derived from the original one: 1. It was the name of the sacred drama which constituted the ceremony of initiation into the secret religiou s associations of the ancients, which were so named from the fact that the \"aspirant\" for initiation was blindfolded. The word \"mystery\" is derived from the Latin mysterium, from the Greek from from to shut the eyes. 2. In the middle ages it came to be applied to a diffe rent sort of \"sacred drama,\" founded on the legends of t he Chris- 220"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. Astronomical Explanations (Continued) tian religion. These \"Mysteries\" or religious drama s, were, however, performed in public, and had no element of secrecy about them. 3. Another use of the word \"mystery\" arose from the fact that all scientific knowledge was formerly conceale d in the ancient Mysteries, and communicated only to the ini tiated. Great skill, therefore in any art which required sc ientific knowledge, anciently implied initiation into the My steries. Hence, in process of time, and even after the Myste ries them- selves were suppressed, the word \"mystery\" was appl ied to any art which required scientific knowledge in addi tion to manual dexterity. The art of architecture is one wh ich requires not only a proficiency in geometry, but several oth er sciences. In more ancient times, owing to the peculiar positi on and con- struction of temples, considerable knowledge of ast ronomy, even, was required by the architect. This art was t herefore pre- eminently above all others denominated a \"mystery,\" and the words \"mystery\" and \"masonry\"—i.e., architecture—be came synonymous in meaning. Architecture was thus probab ly the first one of the arts called a \"mystery\"; this name , however, at length came to be applied to all the arts without d istinction, including even those wholly mechanical. There can be no doubt that all the early architects , at least, like the Tyrian artists who directed the work at th e building of King Solomon's temple, derived the scientific knowl edge required for their profession from having been init iated into the Mysteries of Dionysus. The word \"masonry\" has b een thought to be derived from several different roots, by different writers, but it is not so far removed either in for m or meaning from the word \"mystery\" but that it might not have been derived either directly or indirectly from it. In f act, Hutchinson, in his \"Spirit of Masonry,\" advances the idea that the word is derived from a corruption of the Latin mysterium, but fails to give any satisfactory reason for his opinion. The f oregoing considerations, however, tend to show that his conjecture is 221"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy not without some support. The derivation of the wor d \"mason\" from the french \"magon,\" a house, will only take us back to the Mysteries by another path, for the word \"magon\" is derived from the Latin maceria, a wall or inclosure, which carries with it the idea of secrecy, and the exclus ion of all who have not a right to enter. Thus, all those who were not initi- ated into the Mysteries were called the profane—i.e ., pro-fano, those without the temple—and who had no right to en ter at all times. The words \"temple\" and \"house\" were also anc iently synonymous. (See 2 Kings 6:7-9; also, 2 Chron. 3.) Brother J. H. Little, formerly G. H. P. of Virginia, derive s the word \"Freemasonry\" directly from the Egypto-Coptic, and uses the following language on the subject: Great mistake has arisen from the very name we bear , and many do not understand what we are, or what our name itself means. Masons are not free, in the sens e in which the word is sometimes use; they are positivel y bound by absolute laws, they are the slaves of trut h and their word—unqualified obedience to their duty. The profane are free, the mason is not. The origin of o ur name shows this. Our title is \"Freemason,\" and this is not an English word, nor is our Order of English or igin. The name is not of any of the languages of modern Europe, nor is it found in the classic tongues of G reece and Rome; nor is it a part of the languages of Syri a, Tyre, or Chaldea, nor is it Hebrew. More ancient th an all, it comes from a nation that had organization, archi- tecture, and literature, before Abraham first behel d the stars glitter above the plains of Shinar. It is fro m the language of ancient Egypt; that wonderful land wher e all antediluvian science and art was preserved and extended, where a system of priestly and kingly gov - ernment was carried out which has been the wonder o f the world; that land where men of science, organize d into a close and secret organization, ruled; where they created a mystic language, and where they erected t hose mighty works of architectural skill whose undestroy ed firmness still amazes the world—among these ancient 222"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Chapter 8.

Now, this is Freema- sonry—we are true Sons of Light. (St. Louis \"Freemason's Monthly,\" January, 1872) Q. How came operative architects, or masons, to be the last custodians of the secrets of the ancient Mysteries? A. It has no doubt been a puzzle to more than one, why the architects and temple-builders of antiquity should have been so intimately connected with the Mysteries, and thu s have been in a position to hand down their essential sec rets and philosophical teachings, from generation to generat ion, to those skilled workmen who came after them. In other words, how was it that the operative masons, or architects, became special guardians, and their guilds, or association s the deposi- tories of these philosophical mysteries? If a good and sufficient answer to this question can be found, one great stu mbling block and source of skepticism will be removed. Thi s question we think we can answer. The ancient Mysteries, as i s well known, were celebrated in the hidden recesses of th e temples. In order to present the grand and impressive drama of initia- tion, many secret chambers, doors, and labyrinthian passages had to be constructed within the interior; also, mu ch ingenious mechanism, by which wonderful and sublime spectacul ar effects were produced. It was, therefore, a matter of necessity that the building of a temple (except the bare outs ide walls) should be intrusted only to those who had been duly initiated. Any \"tattling mechanic\" might otherwise disclose th e whole secret. Such operative architects and artists, ther efore, who 223"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy were known and distinguished as the most cunning wo rkmen, were initiated in all branches of the Mysteries, be cause their services were imperatively necessary. Among the buildings uncovered at Pompeii is a templ e of Isis, which is a telltale of the Mysteries of the E gyptian deity, for the secret stairs which conducted the priests u nseen to an opening back of the statue of the goddess, through whose marble lips pretended oracles were given and warnin gs uttered, now lies open to the day, and reveals the whole imposition. (\"A Day in Pompeii,\" \"Harper's Magazine ,\" vol. ii.) When the sages of India conducted Apollonius to the temple of their god, singing hymns and forming a sacred march, the earth, which they struck with the ir staves in cadence, was agitated like a boisterous s ea, and raised up nearly two feet, then calmed itself a nd resumed its usual level. The act of striking with t heir sticks betrays the necessity of warning workmen, wh o were placed beneath, to raise a moving stage covere d with earth—an operation plainly effected by the aid of mechanism, very easy to be comprehended. It is prob a- ble a similar secret existed in other temples. Engl ish travelers who visited the remains of the temple of Ceres, at Eleusis, observed that the pavement of th e sanctuary is rough and unpolished, and much lower than that of the adjacent portico. It is therefore probable that a wooden floor on a level with the portico cov ered the present floor, and concealed a vault designed t o admit of the action of machinery beneath the sanctu ary for moving the floor. In the soil of an interior ve stibule they observed two deeply indented grooves, or ruts, and as no carriage could possibly be drawn into thi s place, the travelers conjectured that these were gr ooves to receive the pulleys which served in the Mysterie s to raise a heavy body—\"perhaps,\" said they, \"a moving floor.\" In confirmation of this opinion, they perce ived further on other grooves which might have served fo r the counterbalances to raise the floor; and they al so detected places for wedges, to fix it immovable at the desired height. These were eight holes fixed in blo cks 224"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. Astronomical Explanations (Continued) of marble, and raised above the floor, four on the right and four on the left, adapted to receive pegs of la rge dimensions. We are also informed that, in order to descend into the caves of Trophonius, those who came to consult the oracle placed themselves before an aperture apparently too narrow to admit a middle sized man; yet, as soon as the kn ees had entered it, the whole body was rapidly drawn in by some invisible power. The mechanism used for this purpos e was connected with other machinery, which at the same t ime enlarged the entrance to the grotto. The person who went to consult this oracle was obliged to make certain sac rifices, to bathe in certain rivers, and to anoint his body wit h oil. He was then clothed in a linen robe, and, with a cake of h oney in his hand, he descended into the grotto in the manner be fore described. What passed there was never revealed, bu t the per- son on his return generally looked pale and dejecte d. The individual whose name this cave bore was an archite ct of great skill, and in conjunction with his brother, Agamide s, was the architect of the temple of Apollo, at Delphi; and t hey were, of course, the designers and constructors of all the m echanical secrets of that temple, no doubt far more ingenious and terri- fying in their nature than those of the oracular ca ve just described. The Mysteries being also celebrated in t he temple, the demand for secrecy was imperative, and the prie sts, fear- ing that the initiation of Trophonius and Agamides would not insure their silence, resorted to assassination. Th e brothers were desired by the god, through the priests, to be cheerful, and to wait eight days for their reward; at the end of which period they were found dead in their beds—the resul t of poi- son, or some other secret means of murder. (See Sal verti's \"Philosophy of Magic,\" vol. 1, Chapter XI). Instances might be multiplied of the secrets involv ed in the construction of ancient temples, which made it a ma tter of necessity that the architects should be initiated, if allowed to 225"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy live. But enough has been advanced to make it plain that the initiation of operative architects was a matter of absolute necessity, When the Mysteries were discontinued, af ter the advent of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire, it was no longer necessary for the temple-b uilders to belong to any such organization, but by that time o perative architects had found that the bond of union which t he initia- tion into the Mysteries had established among them was useful and profitable. It enabled them to keep the higher secrets of their art among themselves, thus giving them a mono poly of the whole business of temple-building. They were th us also enabled to assume an independence and consequence, upon which followed the favor of princes and those high in author- ity, who desired their services to erect a palace o r build a cathedral. The operative architects, therefore, kep t up their secret organization, and thus preserved the occult tie which originally united them in the Mysteries, of whose l egends, signs, and emblems they became the last custodians, after the Mysteries themselves had fallen into disuse, and ce ased to be celebrated either at Athens or Rome. Thus originate d those mysterious \"travelling Freemasons\" of the middle ag es, who left so many \"massive monuments of their skill\" as early as the ninth and tenth centuries. Thus, also, originated t hose famous guilds of operative masons of the fifteenth, sixtee nth, and seventeenth centuries. No other hypothesis will sat isfactorily account for the strange character and mysterious na ture of those secret associations of operative architects. Although the Mysteries themselves are traced back h istori- cally to the days of ancient Egypt, yet there is no chronological impossibility, or even improbability, of their conn ection with the societies above mentioned, for they were celebr ated in some form as late as the eighth and perhaps twelfth century, while the traveling Freemasons are traced back to t he eighth or tenth century.

Maximus, Bishop of Turin, writes in the middle of the fifth century ag ainst the ancient worship, and speaks of it as if existing in full force in the neighborhood of his city. The Eleusinian Myster ies at Athens, indeed, seem to have enjoyed a special exem ption, for Gibbon informs us that the Emperor Valentinian immediately admitted the petition of Pr a- etextatus, proconsul of Achaia, who represented tha t the life of the Greeks would become dreary and com- fortless if they were deprived of the invaluable bl essing of the Eleusinian Mysteries. This petition was, no doubt, accompanied with an as surance that the secret doctrines taught in the Mysteries, being those of the unity and spiritual nature of God, and the immo rtality of the soul, were not inconsistent, but rather in harm ony, with the Christian religion, which would account for the petition being so promptly granted. The Mysteries at Athens, in conse- quence, although suspended, do not seem to have eve r been totally suppressed, but continued to be celebrated in some form as late as the eighth century. It is also cert ain that the Mysteries, under various forms, continued to be cel ebrated in Britain and on the Continent as late as the tenth c entury. Dr. Oliver says, in his \"History of Initiation,\" We are assured, on undoubted authority, namely, fro m the bardic writings of that period, that they were cele- brated in Wales and Scotland down to the twelfth ce n- tury of Christianity. This brings us down to an era when it is admitted o n all hands that the travelling Freemasons existed, by wh om, some claim, our fraternity was invented. It is not, howe ver, claimed that the Mysteries in their purity or original sple ndor existed at so late a period. No doubt they had become corrupt, and 227"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy many of their secrets had been lost. No doubt they had become obscure, but still they existed, impressed w ith their original character. The connection is therefore clo se between them and the mysterious secret rites and ceremonies of those societies of operative masons and architects above mentioned. When, in process of time, the celebration of the an cient Mys- teries in a modified form was confined to these ass ociations of operative architects, for the reasons before given, then it was that the term Freemason began to be descriptive of the initi- ated. This would more rationally account for the present name of our fraternity than the ingenious derivation of the words \"free-mason\" from the Egyptian roots, Phre-massen (Children of Light) as advanced by Brother J. H. Little. Salverti, in his \"Philosophy of Magic,\" is of the o pinion that the occult sciences, possessed by the secret societ ies of the middle ages in Europe were derived from the learnin g taught in the Mysteries. He says: It is certain that, in that age of ignorance, learn ed men have conveyed the charge of their knowledge to secr et societies, which have existed almost in our day. On e of the brightest geniuses who shed honor upon Europe and the human race, Leibnitz, penetrated into one o f these societies at Nuremberg, and, from the avowal of his panegyrist [Fontenelle, \"Eloge de Leibnitz\"], o btained there instructions which, perhaps, he might have so ught for in vain elsewhere. Were these mysterious reunio ns the remains of the ancient initiations? Everything con- duces to the belief that they were, not only the or deal and the examination, to which it was necessary to s ub- mit before obtaining an entrance to them, but, abov e all, the nature of the secrets they possessed, and the means they appear to have employed to preserve them . (See \"Philosophy of Magic,\" vol. 1, Chapter XI) But if, as Salverti learnedly argues, the scientifi c secrets of the Mysteries were thus transmitted to the secret s ocieties of the middle ages, we may be certain that not only th e form of 228"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. Astronomical Explanations (Continued) initiation in substance, but also many of the legen ds or scien- tific allegories, as well as the symbols and emblem s connected therewith, were also handed down in like manner, an d the same may probably be said of many of the signs and modes of recognition. In this connection it is worthy of rem ark that none of the passwords of Freemasonry are either English, German, or French, nor indeed of any modern spoken language . Had Freemasonry been invented, or fabricated, either in Germany, England, or France, such would not have been the ca se. We might as well expect to find the armies of France, Germany, England, or America, using Coptic, Chaldean, and He brew countersigns, as the Freemasons do, had our fratern ity origi- nated in either England, France or Germany. The Antiquity of Masonry Q. What is the probable antiquity of masonry? A. There can be but little doubt that the Mysteries , from which, as we have seen, Freemasonry is the direct d escendant, were first arranged when Taurus was on the vernal equinox, Leo at the summer solstice, and Scorpio at the autumnal equi- nox. The solar allegory, as handed down to us, show s this to be the fact. At the rate of the precession of the e quinoxes is known, we can calculate when the vernal equinox was in Taurus. Such a calculation will take us back about four thousand two hundred and eighty years. The antiquit y of masoniy is thus written on the face of the starry h eavens—a record which utters no falsehoods. Freemasonry Not Sun-Worship Q. Is it to be understood, from the foregoing pages, that Free- masonry is nothing more than a fragment of an idola trous form of sun-worship? A. Such is far from being the case, nor has anythin g been advanced in the foregoing pages which, unless wholl y misun- derstood, gives any countenance to such an idea. In the intro- 229"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy ductory chapter it was fully shown that the Mysteri es themselves, in their primitive and uncorrupted form , taught the unity of God and the immortality of man as thei r cardinal doctrines, and that the sun was but a symbol of him whom \"the sun, moon, and stars obey, and beneath whose a ll-seeing eye even comets perform their stupendous revolution s\" (Masonic Lecture). Though in all parts of our ritual, from the thresho ld to the altar, and from the altar to the penetralia (as in the ancient Mysteries, from which Freemasonry has descended) th e pro- foundest truths of science and true religion are ta ught and illustrated by astronomical allegories, yet nowhere do we find, even in its most ancient portions, any prayers, inv ocations, or adoration, addressed to the heavenly bodies themsel ves. The sun and the hosts of heaven are only used as emblem s of the Deity—a sacred symbolism, with which the Bible itself abounds. In more ancient times, when false and idolatrous fo rms of religion ruled all the civilized nations, masonry p rotected the worshippers of the true God. This was not only true in Rome and in Greece, where Socrates and Pythagoras fell m artyrs to truth, but also in Palestine. When we call to mind the long succession of Hebrew kings \"who did evil in the sig ht of the Lord,\" and sacrificed to Baal \"upon the high places and in the grove,\" a crime of which even Solomon was guilty in his old age, we can easily see that, except at certain favo rable epochs, it was not safe, \"no, not even in Judea,\" to deny t he actual divinity of the sun, moon, and stars. The Jews ston ed the prophets just as the Greeks persecuted the philosop hers. The great debt that not only religion but science owes to masonry can hardly be estimated. In its ritual, as we have seen, most of the truths of astron- omy and geometry are illustrated and perpetuated. A nd it would be no stretch of the imagination to say that, if all, whether of books or manuscripts, were swept out of exist- 230"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Chapter 8.

Rest assured we will never find an y proof that lodges exactly like ours, presided over by a Worshipful Master and Wardens, and conferring the Entered Apprentice Fellow-craft, and Master's degree, existed in ancient Egypt. Freemasonry, like the Christian system of theology and mode of worship, has undergone many modifications s ince the day of its advent; yet, like Christianity, it h as preserved its identity, as well as all of its vital principles and most exa lted features in all ages. Although in masonry there has been no \"apostolic succession,\" beginning with the Grand Hi erophant of the Osirian Mysteries and ending with the presen t highly respected Grand Master of New York, yet the identit y of our Order can be traced from a remote antiquity just as satisfacto- rily from a remote antiquity just as satisfactorily as the identity of the Christian religion can be traced from our Pr otestant churches (who deny all \"apostolic succession\") on b eyond the Reformation, and through the Catholic Church, with, in earlier times, its half-pagan rites, back to the plains of Judea and the advent of Christ. Nor does the vast difference whic h such a view of Christianity discloses, in doctrine, practi ce, ritual, and mode of worship at different eras in the past, or a t present in different lands and among different sects, at all o bscure the real identity of the Christian system in all ages s ince its pro- mulgation. In like manner the antiquity of our fraternity and its iden- tity are established—not so much by any such close corre- spondence of our present ritual and emblems with th ose of ancient times (as some investigators illogically lo ok for), as from other considerations. It is quite enough if we are able to discover in ancient times, when polytheism was the dominant state religion in all nations, societies possessed of similar orga- nizations, and, like Freemasonry, teaching the two great doc- trines of the unity of God, as O NE E TERNAL Spiritual Being, and the immortality of the soul of man—societies like m asonry, secret in their nature, and possessed of words, sig ns, and other 234"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Chapter 9.

These things certainly demonstrate the identity of modern Freemasonry with those ancient organizations, just as conclu- sively as the identity of modern Christianity, as a system of religion, with that of the first century or any int ermediate time, is established by a like train of reasoning and cor respon- dences. If, on the contrary, we confine our attenti on to the present condition of Freemasonry, as disclosed in t he various degrees and \"rites\" into which it has divided itsel f, just as Christianity has split into Catholics and Protestan ts, and the lat- ter again into numerous sects—if we regard nothing but the verbal form of our ritual—it is easy to show that masonry is not of any very great antiquity. The date and even the author- ship of some parts of our verbal ritual can be and have been traced, but neither the Chevalier Ramsey nor yet th ose who met at the famous \"Appletree Tavern,\" in 1717, were the founders and inventors of Freemasonry, any more tha n Luther and Wesley were the authors of the Christian religi on. If we view masonry from a rational standpoint, and con- template its mystic legends and allegories in their substance, without regard to the modern language in which they are now clothed; if we investigate the meaning of its cerem onies, with- out regard to the specific words now used in conduc ting them; if we study the signs, symbols, and emblems, disreg arding the erroneous modern explanation given to many of them— the great antiquity of masonry is at once apparent. It is now admit- ted on all sides that all the ancient Mysteries wer e identical, and had a common origin from those of Egypt, a conc lusion which has been reached by the same method of reason ing comparison. The legend of Osiris is the parent stoc k from 235"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy which all the others came, but in Greece and Asia M inor the name of Osiris disappeared, and those of Dionysus a nd Bac- chus were substituted, while in the Hebrew-Tyrian t emple leg- end the name of Hiram is found. The claim, however, that the legend of Hiram is an actual history, descriptive o f events which really took place about the time of the build ing of King Solomon's temple, must be abandoned by the few who still blindly cling to it. Masonry can no longer hope to stand without critici sm in this age of inquiry. There is a spirit abroad which does not hesitate to catch Antiquity by its gray beard, stat e into its wrin- kled face, and demand upon what authority, of right reason, or authentic history, it founds its pretensions. Th e masonic tra- dition cannot hope to escape examination in its tur n; and, when it is examined, it will not stand the test as claiming to be historically true. If, then, we have no explanation to offer, it must be discarded, and take its place among many ot her exploded legends of the past. By showing, however, that it is not intended as an actual history, but is really a sublime alle- gory of great antiquity, teaching the profoundest t ruths of astronomy, and inculcating, by an ancient system of types, symbols, and emblems, an exalted code of morals, we at once reply to and disarm all that kind of criticism. The masonic Order is thus placed on a loftier plane, and assume s a position which challenges the respect and admiration of both the learned and virtuous; the learned, because they wil l thus be enabled to recognize it as the depository of an anc ient system of scientific knowledge; the virtuous, because the Order also stands revealed to them as having been in past ages the pre- server of true worship, and the teacher of morality and broth- erly love. It has been the boast of masonry that it s ritual contained great scientific as well as moral truths. While this was plainly the fact as to the moral teachings of o ur Order, to a large number of our most intelligent brothers the key which along could unlock the masonic treasury of scientific truth 236"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Chapter 9. Conclusion appeared to have been lost. We believe that key is at length restored; for, if the masonic traditions and legend s, with the ritual illustrating them, are regarded as astronomi cal allegories, the light of scientific truth is at once seen to il luminate and permeate every part. If the explanation given in th e foregoing pages is correct, any person who fully understands the mean- ing and intention of the legends and ceremonies, sy mbols, and emblems of our Order, is necessarily well informed as to the sciences of astronomy and geometry, which form the founda- tion of all the others. And why is not the explanation correct? Have you ev er considered the \"calculus of probabilities,\" as appl ied to a sub- ject like this? That masonry should contain a singl e allusion to the sun, might happen, and imply nothing. The same might be said if it contained but three or four; but when we find that the name of the Order, the form, dimensions, lights, or naments, and furniture of its lodges, and all the emblems, s ymbols, cer- emonies, words, and signs, without exception, allud e to the annual circuit of the sun—that astronomical ideas a nd solar symbols are interwoven into the very texture of the whole institution, and, what is still more significant, t hat there is such a harmony of relation existing between all these astronomical allusions as to render the whole ritual capable of a perfect and natural interpretation as an astronomical allegory, which is also one and complete —the probability that it was originally so intended is overwhelming, and amounts to a positive demon- stration. There are millions of probabilities to on e against the theory of the allegory being accidental and not des igned. Can any reasonable mind suppose that, when Bunyon wrote his \"Pilgrim's Progress,\" the story was an al legory of the trials and triumphs of a Christian life by an accident only, and that the author if it never intended or designed th e allegory at all?

As to the antiquity of masonry, that, we have shown , rests on the astronomical basis, and enables us to mathem atically demonstrate its remote origin, independent of the u ncertain and dim light of ancient history and tradition. It is true that its exact date cannot be fixed, but the proof that maso nry is of great antiquity, and was founded by men of profound knowl- edge and exalted virtue, is conclusive: men of grea t learning, because their scientific knowledge lies embalmed in their work to this day; men of exalted virtue, because ou r ritual inculcates a code of morality never equaled or exce lled until the promulgation in later times of the New Testamen t. The method by which the annual progress of the sun in the zodiac is illustrated, in our explanation of th e masonic alle- gory, also affords a key to the greater part of anc ient mythol- ogy, the tales of which are founded upon the same b asis, and are but so many different allegories of the same as tronomical facts. When these stories were first invented by th e learned, for the twofold purpose of preserving and concealin g the truths of astronomy, the parallel was, of course, m ore perfectly preserved in each, throughout the whole narrative, than it is in the forms in which they have come down to us. Being orally transmitted, they underwent, in the lapse of long p eriods of time, material alterations; and particulars, not in entire har- mony with the original allegory, were introduced in order to make the stories more in correspondence with the in cidents of actual human life. The vulgar, who did not understa nd the true meaning of these astronomical parables, were most p rone to make these changes. For these reasons the parallel and alle- 238"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Chapter 9.

It would, no doubt, be interesting to thus explain and interpret other mythological tales of antiquity, but the desi red limits and special purpose of this work forbid. Having, howeve r, pointed out the key which will unlock them all, and the met hod by which to conduct such an investigation, those of my readers who are curious in such matters will find their tim e not lost if employed in a more extended examination, from an as tro- nomical point of view, of the poetical and wonderfu l adven- tures of the gods. Whatever doubt may rest upon the origin of masonry, or obscurity exist as to the people among whom it firs t was established, it is certainly the most venerable and ancient of all existing institutions organized by man. The very ob scurity as to its origin, which is lost in the dim distance of bygone ages, testifies to its real antiquity, its lodges exist i n all lands, and the sound of the Worshipful Master's gavel, as he calls the breth- ren to order, \"following the sun in its course, enc ircles the globe.\" Its principles are as universal as its diffusion. N o difference of race or color, country, clime, language, or reli gion, excludes any worthy and moral man from our Order. Only the a theist, the madman, or the fool, the vicious, imbecile, dep raved, or degraded, are forbidden to enter our ranks, and sha re in all the rights, honors, and benefits of our ancient fra ternity. At our assemblies meet in harmony the Christian, th e Hebrew, the Mohammedan, the Buddhist, and the Brahm an, the followers of Confucius and the disciples of Zor oaster.

At the present day it is not only one o f the most popular, but also one of the most powerful and wide spread, of all organizations. While the fraternity is day by day drawing to its r anks the most intelligent and virtuous everywhere, a growing interest is also manifest among the members of the Order itself , and a disposition to inquire more fully into its origin a nd history, as well as to study its peculiar and beautiful system of ancient symbolical instruction. It is to be hoped that this newly awak- ened interest among masons will increase and bear a bundant fruit, for in the ritual and emblems of our Order i s a treasury of useful knowledge and sublime truth which at every s tep will amply reward him who diligently seeks. The subject is pro- found enough to enlist the highest intellect and th e most accomplished scholarship. These investigations shou ld be aided by all masons, and those engaged in them be e ncour- aged to bring the results of their labors into the lodge-room, and communicate them for the benefit of all the bre thren.
