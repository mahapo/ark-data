America'swonderful liberty and abundance are slipping away. Free markets aredisappearing. Opportunity has diminished and poverty is growing.Until the 1970's, each generation of Americans expected to do better than anywho came before. No more. Statistics confirm that our children are the firstAmericans ever to have little chance of living as well as their parents. If thedrift away from free markets continues, they may not even live as long, and ourgrandchildren certainly won't.Many free-market advocates assume that if Americans can be taught enougheconomics they will again become dedicated to free markets; the downhill slidewill be reversed. Educational efforts are under way to achieve this, but I'mafraid they won't be enough.Teaching economics is important, but by itself it will not revive support forfree markets.To my knowledge, not once in all of history has any nation, including America,acquired a free market through the people's understanding of free markets.A long ignored key point in American history is that Adam Smith's seminaleconomic analysis wealth of nations was not published until 1776.This means economics at the time of the American Revolution was a fledglingscience. The exact reasons why free markets are so effective in eliminatingpoverty and creating abundance were still unclear.Whatever Happened to Justice?iYet America became the most free and prosperous land ever known.How did people who did not understand economics know to create free markets?They didn't, but they were dedicated to the principles of the old common law.When these elementary legal principles are widely obeyed, free markets spring upautomatically. Even if the people have no knowledge of economics whatsoever—evenif they cannot read—a free market develops, it's automatic.The world seems to be constructed in such a way that liberty and abundancebecome widespread when ethical behavior becomes widespread. The two fundamentalprinciples of common law are a part of the fabric of the universe. Disobey themand life gets worse; obey and life gets better.Observe Hong Kong. A magnet for Red China's impoverished victims of socialism,this city is often cited as a model of free market effectiveness. It's one ofthe most prosperous in Asia. Yet most in Hong Kong know nothing of free marketeconomics. The city's legal system happens to be based on British common lawprinciples. 1We must revive the American people's dedication to the basic principles of theold common law. In this book I've summarized these basics into a simple formulaof 17 words. These 17 words are a recipe for reversing America's decline andgiving the young the opportunities we had.Once the people become dedicated to this formula, free markets will be revived.It's automatic.—Richard J. Maybury1 Until Red China takes over in 1997.\"At what point shall we expect the approach of danger? By what means shall wefortify against it?\"Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crushus at a blow? Never!

Exchanging letters 2 about economics was funfor me, too. I'm glad you enjoyed my stories about inflation, investment cyclesand recessions. I'm sure you'll someday find them useful in managing your owninvestments and career or business.You asked a profound question. You wanted to know the root cause of America'seconomic problems. \"What's at the bottom of it all?\" you wondered.You are correct in assuming economics isn't the final answer. There is somethingeven more fundamental than that—it's law.In my next letter I'll begin telling you the story about the connection betweenour economic problems and our legal problems.. 2 Whatever Happened to Penny Candy? by Richard J. Maybury, Bluestocking Press,Box 1014, Placerville, CA 95667.Whatever Happened to Justice?This may sound hopelessly complex but, like most subjects, it's really quitesimple once you understand it. Some years ago I read a book that broughtEinstein's theory of relativity down to an eighth grade level. This convinced methat any subject can be made easy.In other words, always beware of anyone who tells you a topic is above you orbetter left to experts. This person may, for some reason, be trying to shut youout. You can understand almost anything. If you know you are giving it your besteffort and you are still finding an explanation difficult to grasp, it may bebecause the expert has poor communication skills. It could also be that theexpert doesn't want you to grasp it. Many people are twice as smart as theythink they are but they've been intimidated into believing some topics are abovethem.In my previous letters I mentioned one of my favorite remarks by AlexanderHamilton:\"Men give me some credit for genius. All the genius I have lies in this: When Ihave a subject in hand, I study it profoundly. Day and night it is before me. Iexplore it in all its bearings. My mind becomes pervaded with it. Then theeffort which I make, the people are pleased to call the fruit of genius. It isthe fruit of labor and thought.\"I also like Thomas Edison's remark that, \"Genius is one percent inspiration andninety-nine percent perspiration.\"Before we get started I should add a few other notes of caution.First, this will not be an objective, unbiased presentation. I believe America'sFounders were right about law, power andThe Cause Is Law17government. Through my letters and their own words, I think you, too, will drawsome rather startling conclusions—conclusions that might not be consistent withwhat you' ve already been taught. Throughout your life you've only heard oneside of the story. I believe you are old enough now to hear the other. You areasking good, honest questions, and they deserve good, honest answers.Second, in a few places F11 be mentioning religion. Please don't be alarmed.What I have to say won't contradict any of your religious principles. Come tothink of it, nothing I have to say will conflict with the principles of anyother religion, either. Religion is part of American history. Legislation haserased it from your history books. To study law without including religion is tohear only one side of the story. You are ready for the other.Please keep an open mind. I'm confident you'll soon be entirely comfortable, andeven excited, about these ideas. America'sFounders were so captivated by them they were willing to risk their lives forthem.\"// may be affirmed, on the best grounds, that no small share of the presentembarrassments of America is to be charged on the blunders of ourgovernments.... What indeed are all the repealing, explaining, and amendinglaws, which fill and disgrace our voluminous codes, but so many monuments ofdeficient wisdom.\"James Madison Federalist #62\"The facility and excess of lawmaking seem to be the diseases to which ourgovernments are most liable.\"James Madison Federalist #62Whatever Happened to Justice?If you are like most of the people to whom I've introduced these ideas, yourmind will quickly flood with challenges and questions. \"But what about this?What about that?\" Be patient, we'll cover all important points, and I'll do mybest to answer all your questions. The bridge to the Promised Land was torn downyears ago and we must rebuild it one brick at a time before we can cross over.In places I will be critical of politics. Please don't get the impression I'mbeing unpatriotic. The government is not the country. I've been around the worldand visited many lands, from highly advanced Switzerland to horribly backwardIndia, and would not want to live anywhere but here.America is special and everyone knows it. I remember an elderly innkeeper in apicturesque little village in the Austrian Alps, a prosperous place. He askedwhere I was from and I said America. With a wistful look in his eyes heexclaimed, \"Ah, a dream, a dream!\"In 1785, Jefferson went to Europe. He wrote back to James Monroe:\"My God! how little do my countrymen know what precious blessings they are inpossession of and which no other people on earth enjoy. I confess I had no ideaof it myself. While we shall see multiplied instances of Europeans going to livein America, I will venture to say, no man now living will ever see an instanceof an American removing to settle in Europe, and continuing there.\"The fact that I care so much about this wonderful country is one major reason Iwrite these letters. Again, you deserve to hear the other side of the storyabout democracy, power and government.The Cause Is Law19For now, remember that a nation's economic system is a result of its legalsystem.

Reproducedfrom the dictionary of American portraits, published by Dover Publications,Inc., in 1967.picture2 [images/picture2.jpg]\"My God! how little do my countrymen know what precious blessings they are inpossession of and which no other people on earth enjoy.\" — Thomas JeffersonWhatever Happened to Justice?2A Higher AuthorityDear Chris,Much of what we will be covering in these letters will be foreign to you becauseit's been almost completely erased from American culture. You could ask yourparents or teachers but odds are that they couldn't help you much. Most of thiswill be as new to them as it is to you.But this is also what will make it fun. You'll be exploring a world few livingAmericans have ever seen, they don't even know it exists. When we're through,you'll be amazed at how much more you understand of daily life and importantpublic issues than your friends do. So let's get started.America was founded foremost on the belief that there is a Higher Authority thanany human authority and a Higher Law than any human law.Different creeds use different names when discussing this Higher Authority.Thomas Jefferson and other American Founders often referred to Nature, but mostjust said God. The first paragraph of the Declaration of Independence containedan artful combination: \". .. the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God. ..\"A Higher Authority21George Washington seemed to believe in a personal, Biblical God that cared abouthumans as individuals. He was often seen on his knees praying.Thomas Paine believed in a less personal \"Nature\" that was systematic, almostmechanical. Paine was convinced laws of morality could be discovered throughscientific observation and logic. He wrote a wonderful book about this calledthe age of reason, and agreed with Greek philosopher Plutarch who said, \"Tofollow God and obey reason is the same thing.\" Thomas Jefferson leaned this way,too.Incidentally, Paine isn't well known today but if we count Jefferson as the mostimportant of the Founders, Paine was probably number two. His writing ralliedAmericans to the cause, and his pamphlet common sense led to the Declaration ofIndependence.In the American tradition, what counts is that we assume there is a HigherAuthority than any human authority and a Higher Law than any human law.In a speech before the Heritage Foundation, U.S. Supreme Court Judge ClarenceThomas quoted John Quincy Adams as saying:\"Our political way of life is by the laws of nature, of nature's God, and ofcourse presupposes the existence of God, the moral ruler of the universe, and arule of right and wrong, of just and unjust, binding upon man, preceding allinstitutions of human society and of government.\"The last nine words of that statement are the most important.The major religions and philosophies all teach the exis-Whatever Happened to Justice?tence of a Higher Authority. One of the most dramatic stories is in the MoslemKoran.The Koranic story says Pharaoh was shown Allah's \"mightiest miracle, but hedenied it and rebelled.\" The Pharaoh \"quickly went away and, summoning all hismen, made to them a proclamation. 'I am your supreme Lord,' he said.\" The Koranthen tells us Allah \"smote him,\" and goes on to warn, \"Surely in this there is alesson for the Godfearing.\"Says the Bible, \"No man can serve two masters.\" The first of the TenCommandments taught by Jews and Christians is, \"I am the Lord thy God, thoushalt not have strange gods before me.\"The Koran's story about the Pharaoh says it one way and the First Commandmentsays it another, but it's the same message. As far as I know, every majorreligion has something to say about a Higher Authority, but few these days sayit very loudly.Chris, how do you feel about what we've covered so far? To me it seems onlylogical. Imagine if there were no authority higher than the government.Governments are, after all, nothing more than collections of exceedingly humanpoliticians and bureaucrats. What if these people who are mere flesh and bloodlike you and me were the top, the be all and end all, the final answer? Howdepressing. And frightening.It's time I introduce you to the idea of a Higher Law.Uncle EricA Higher Law23A Higher LawDear Chris,As mentioned in the previous remark by John Quincy Adams, America's Foundersassumed the Higher Authority has given us a Higher Law that we must all learnand obey. In his excellent book the American tradition, historian Clarence B.Carson quotes Alexander Hamilton:\"Good and wise men, in all ages, have...supposed that the Deity... hasconstituted an eternal and immutable law, which is indispensably obligatory uponall mankind, prior to any human institution whatever.\"Notice Hamilton said obligatory upon all mankind. No exceptions. This is veryimportant. Higher Law applies to everyone equally.This is what is meant by those five words in the Declaration of Independence\"all men are created equal.\" No one gets any special privileges or exemptionsfrom the Law. If something is prohibited for you and me, it's prohibited forkings, dukes, presidents, minorities, majorities and everyone else.Whatever Happened to Justice?Majorities? Thomas Jefferson said:\"It is strangely absurd to suppose that a million human beings collectedtogether are not under the same moral laws which bind each of them separately.\"The commandment does not say, \"Thou shalt not steal unless the majority votesfor it.\" Nor does it say, \"Thou shalt not steal unless you believe it isnecessary.\" It says only, \"Thou shalt not steal.\" Period. No exceptions.I'm sure your parents have taught you that an American bows to no one. Americansstand tall, they look each other straight in the eye and they shake hands. Thismay sound like a small thing but it's profoundly important. Each time it happensit is a reconfirmation that no one is exempt from the law, all are equal. Equalrights, equal responsibilities. To bow is to open the door to exceptions.Incidentally, this belief in a Higher Authority and a Higher Law goes backthousands of years. In the book ancient law published in 1861, legal historianHenry Sumner Maine pointed out that in researching early political and legalorganizations, \"symptoms of this belief meet us on all sides.\" Maine refers to a\"supernatural presidency\" assumed by most original legal systems.But already I can hear you asking, \"If the Higher Authority has given us aHigher Law, how do we know what this Law is?\"Good question. After all, religions and philosophies often disagree. Is there acommon ground where they all meet?Yes, most emphatically yes. In my next letter I'll begin the story about theworld's best system for learning and applying Higher Law.A Higher Law25By the way, most of the Founders' work has been forgotten. I doubt one Americanin a thousand ever reads it any more.Ask your friends. I'll bet they know little more than that George Washingtonchopped down a cherry tree and Ben Franklin flew a kite.These were some of the wisest men in all human history. Their words, andwarnings, are filled with insight. A half hour with Thomas Jefferson is moreenlightening than a week with anyone else I know, except maybe James Madison orPatrick Henry. You'll be amazed at how much farther you can see when you arestanding on the shoulders of Jefferson.However, the Founders weren't perfect. Thomas Paine was fond of alcohol. BenFranklin was a philanderer. Jefferson owned slaves. Washington's pride led himinto unforgivable military blunders.These people were as human as you and me, and like you and me they were productsof their times. But they believed a better world was possible and they roseabove their origins to achieve it. This is what made them heroes. The libertyand abundance Americans enjoy today are mostly a result of the founder's visionand efforts—and risks. They laid their lives on the line.Explore their work, it's great.Let me caution you to start not with books about the Founders but with their ownwork in their own words. Many books about American history — I'm tempted to saymost now — are written by socialists who subtly discredit or trivialize theFounders and their principles. It's okay to read these books once you knowenough about economics to spot the slant, but for now stick with the actualthoughts of the Founders themselves. One of the best sources is therevolutionary years edited by Mortimer J. Adler.Whatever Happened to Justice?Of course, in honesty I must admit that my own letters are slanted. I believethe Founders were right and I'm trying to convince you. As I said earlier, allyour life you've heard only one side of the story and this is one of the fewchances you'll have to hear the other.Were all the American Founders squeaky clean in their motives? Certainly not.Madison was probably as close to being totally honorable as any human has everbeen, but other Founders did have hidden agendas that included attempts toacquire power or money. Some undoubtedly tried to rig the Constitution to theirown benefit. But, for reasons that remain unexplained to this day, the endresult of all these competing interests was a Constitution of checks andbalances that produced the most free and prosperous nation in all human history.Before leaving the topic of religion I should mention this. You've probably metpersons who hate other people's religions and accuse these others of being inleague with the devil. Some even accuse others of being inherently warlike.Any religion can be used for evil purposes, and many have at one time oranother. The Crusades, the Inquisition, the Thirty Years War—history is filledwith examples.In these letters I will try to set ancient hatreds and rivalries aside and lookonly for what is best in each religion. I think you'll be delighted to find thatthe points where the religions are finest are also the points where they agree.Chris, until my next letter remember that America was founded on the belief thata Higher Authority has given us a Higher Law which, in Hamilton's words, \"isindispensably obligatory upon all mankind.\" Or, as Jefferson wrote, \"All men arecreated equal.\"Uncle EricTwo Kinds Of Law274Two Kinds Of LawDear Chris,Throughout history, humans have used two basic kinds of legal systems. One isscientific and the other political.Americans are no longer taught anything about these two kinds of law. Lawyersare aware of the two kinds but after they leave law school they are forced towork almost entirely in the political legal system. Never having much contactwith scientific law, they soon forget it, and rarely mention it.Many of America's Founders in 1776 and 1787 were lawyers. (At that time, lawyerswere highly respected. Today, they are viewed with suspicion. Why the change?I'll talk about that in a future letter.) America's Founders took care to insurethat their new country would be founded on the principles of scientific law.\"In a democracy, opinions that upset everyone are sometimes ex-actly what weneed. We should be teaching our children the scientific method and the Bill ofRights.\"Carl Sagan &Ann Druyan 23 \"Real Patriots Ask Questions,\" parade magazine, Sept. 8,1991.Whatever Happened to Justice?To understand the differences between a political legal system and a scientificone, we must know how scientific law developed. We need to start all the wayback in the Dark Ages around 500 A.D. My next few letters will be devotedentirely to scientific law, then we'll get into political law. When you'vefinished with my letters, you'll be ready to read the enterprise of law by BruceL. Benson. This is a scholarly, thoroughly researched history of early commonlaw systems and a plan for returning to them. But, let's begin here....Fifteen centuries ago the Roman Empire had collapsed. Barbarians had overrunEurope and set up feudal governments. These governments were bloodthirsty andbrutal but, for the common people, they had one good point, they were lazy. Theyhad little interest in the day-to-day affairs of the people. As long as thecommoners paid taxes and fought in whatever wars they were ordered to fight in,their new governments left them alone.This meant many kingdoms had no government court systems. When two individualshad a dispute, they were left to work it out on their own.We can imagine what happened. Disputes often led to brawls or worse. Afterseveral bloody incidents, the commoners would surely begin looking for ways toavoid violence.It's likely that when two individuals had a dispute, their families and friendswould gather round and tell them to find some neutral third party to listen totheir stories and make a decision.Legal historians tell us the most highly respected and neutral third party inthe community was usually a clergyman. The opponents would be brought beforethis clergyman and he would listen to both sides of their story.The clergyman would consult moral guidelines such as theTwo Kinds Of Law 29Ten Commandments and make a decision. The grapevine would spread this decisionthroughout the community. It would become a precedent for later decisions.Precedent is very important.The reasoning behind it was simple. The fundamental nature of homo sapiensdoesn't change much; what was right yesterday remains right today. Notice theemphasis on basics, on eternal truths.Humans seem to have a built-in desire for legal systems based on precedent. Whatparent hasn't heard, \"If Johnny can do it why can't I?\" Each family has its ownbody of law developed one case at a time.This law can be complex. Every child knows that the specific definitions of suchphrases as \"on time\" and \"too late\" can be very important. Loopholes are soughtlike gold nuggets. The parents are under continual pressure to hone theirrulings so that no misunderstandings are possible.This method of evolving law on a case by case basis is called case law.Developed by judges, it was the beginning of scientific law. In a future letterI'll explain what made it scientific.As decades passed, the precedents were written down and kept in a safe place.Persons who were not too clear about how to handle an unusual businesstransaction or some other sticky matter could study them to better plan aheadand avoid problems.Eventually some of the clergymen became so skilled at listening to cases andmaking sound judgments that they acquired much prestige. Demand for theirservices grew and they became full-time judges. The body of precedents theyproduced became the law of common usage, the \"common law.\"Whatever Happened to Justice?A key point: Common law was based on religious and philosophical principles.This is how it determined right and wrong. What other way is there?In 1897, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. pointed out, \"The lawis full of phraseology drawn from morals.\" 4Chris, in my next letter I will continue talking about scientific law.Specifically I will introduce you to the two fundamental principles underlyingthe old common law. After a half-dozen or so letters we'll get into politicallaw, then government.Until next time remember two points: First, there are two kinds of law,political and scientific. Second, the old common law was a scientific legalsystem that grew out of court decisions — precedents — based on religiousprinciples. In its early years common law had little connection with government,it was spawned by the religions.Uncle Eric4 See the article \"The Path of the Law\" by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., from thebook, Law, edited by Sara Robbins, Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1990, p. 276.The Two Fundamental Laws315The Two Fundamental LawsDear Chris,A major problem a common law judge encountered was disputes between persons fromdifferent communities or of different religions. Guidelines on which cases weredecided had to be those which all reasonable persons held in common.After much thought, the judges came up with two fundamental laws on which allmajor religions and philosophies agree: (1) do all you have agreed to do and (2)do not encroach on other persons or their property. A simple formula, 17 words.Black's Law Dictionary defines encroach as follows:\"To enter by gradual steps or stealth into the possessions or rights of another;to trespass or intrude. To gain or intrude unlawfully upon the lands, property,or authority of another.\"Each religion or philosophy expresses these laws in different ways but allconcur on these two laws—and not much else.The not much else is as important as the two laws. I'll explain shortly.About the law of agreements, the Bible says, \"Better it isWhatever Happened to Justice?that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.\" 5The Koran says, \"Woe unto the unjust who, when others measure for them, exact infull, but when they measure or weigh for others, defraud them.\" 6About encroaching on others or their property, Judaism and Christianity bothsay, \"Thou shalt not steal\" and \"Thou shalt not murder.\"It's amazing how close the wording can sometimes be. In Christianity, Jesussays, \"Do unto others what you would want others to do unto you.\" One ofJudaism's great teachers, Hillel, says, \"Do not do unto others what you do notwant others to do unto you.\"The same thought, do unto others, is contained in the Confucian philosophy. 7This originated in China four centuries and five-thousand miles apart from theChristian and Jewish philosophies.The two laws are stated and restated \"Can the liberties of a nation bethroughout the lore of all thought secure when we have re-the great religions.moved their onlyfirmbasis, a convic-Except for them we have little or no agreement about right and wrong.So, these are the only two rules that can be enforced on everyone. To go beyondthem would be encroachment.5 Ecclesiastes, V, 16 The Unjust, 83:17 Freedom and the Law by Bruno Leoni, Nash Publishing, Los Angeles, 1972, p. 14They are the point on which all come together.tion in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of God?That they are not to be violated but with his wrath?\"But only these two.Thomas JeffersonThe Two Fundamental Laws 33Since encroachment is forbidden, each person is free to obey other laws if he orshe wishes. If, for instance, you wish to obey laws requiring charity,compassion, respect or something else, no one can rightfully interfere as longas you do not violate the two fundamental laws.Common law was the body of definitions and procedures growing out of these twolaws. \"Do all you have agreed to do\" was the basis of the part of common lawcalled contract law.\"Do not encroach on other persons or their property\" was the basis of criminallaw and tort law. (Tort law concerns harm done by one person to another.)This is how common law became the source of all our basic laws against theft,fraud, kidnapping, rape, murder, and so forth. A judge would listen to a caseand find that someone had broken an agreement or encroached.Did you think these acts were made illegal by Congress? No, they were illegallong before Congress existed. Long before Columbus discovered America, they werefound to be illegal by judges in precedents based on religious principles.Why are Americans no longer taught anything about common law? Hard to say. Myguess is that since tax-supported schools are prohibited from teaching anyone'sreligion (and rightly so, who's religion would they teach?) these schools areunable to teach about the origin of our most important laws. As a result, fewAmericans grow up today knowing anything about common law. You can test thisyourself. Ask any adult, what was common law?Unable to teach about common law, the schools teach only political law.Many religions teach the basics of common law without even realizing that commonlaw grew from these rules.Church attendance is declining. Reliable statistics on the number of Americanswho attended church regularly in the34 Whatever Happened to Justice?early 1800's are hard to come by, but I don't think any historian would disagreethat it was a large number, 75 percent or more. Today, it's down to 40 percent.8 Many clergy are distressed at the decline in their congregations.This distresses me, too, because I suspect this is causing a serious problem forparents. The religions were the source of the idea of Natural Law—meaning thelaws of the universe that common law judges were trying to discover. Americansabsorbed this idea automatically through their religious training. I am afraidthat many who throw out religion are also unknowingly throwing out Natural Law.They are left with the inescapable conclusion that right and wrong are onlymatters of opinion. They no longer know what to teach their children. Ratherthan using objective truth, Higher Law, they resort to subjective opinion. Theresult will be a generation, not of immoral children, but of amoral children.In its early years, common law was a private legal system completely independentof government. This is important. Many Americans today believe law andgovernment are nearly the same thing but this is incorrect. Law and governmentare two very different institutions and they do not necessarily go together. 9Law is a service provided by courts, and a code of conduct. Government issomething much different. Law came from religious principles, government camefrom...what?We'll get into that in a future letter. First we have more ground to cover aboutcommon law and political law. In my next letter I'll explain how common law wasenforced.8 \"Still Praying,\" The Economist, May 20, 1989, p. 35.9 Nor are the government and the country the same thing. When we pledgeallegiance to the flag, exactly what are we pledging allegiance to? Ourhomeland? Our government?The Two Fundamental Laws35Incidentally, you might be wondering if many people today agree on the twofundamental laws. For ten years I have been writing articles and travelingaround the U.S. giving speeches about these laws. I've delivered the message tohundreds of thousands, and have never had anyone disagree with these two laws.Not one person.Some members of an audience will disagree with almost anything. I even had oneperson tell me he didn't like my tie — but not these two laws.If you meet people who disagree with these laws, ask if they'd like to live in aworld where these laws are not obeyed.Some people do disagree with the idea of a Higher Authority. They believe thereis nothing higher than the government. But they still agree with the two laws.They just believe the government is entitled to disobey these laws wheneverofficials believe this is necessary. These persons say the rest of us must obeybut government officials are special.Until my next letter remember there are two fundamental laws on which all majorreligions and philosophies agree: Do all you have agreed to do, and do notencroach on other persons or their property. These rules are the basis of commonlaw which held that everyone must obey, no exceptions. All men are createdequal.Incidentally, always bear in mind that an agreement must be voluntary. Anagreement resulting from force or deception is not binding.Chris, let me finish with a very important point. Except when I say otherwise, Iwill always be writing about these laws as they apply to competent adults, notchildren or persons with mental impairments.No one has ever found a completely logical system for dealing with children orthe mentally impaired. All agree thatWhatever Happened to Justice?rights and responsibilities are attached to mental ability, but none agree onwhich rights or which responsibilities, or what level of mental ability.If a three-year old stole something, no court would do much about it. If atwenty-one-year old steals, any court would. But where do we draw the line, andwhy there? No one has ever figured this out—the lines are drawn arbitrarily. 10Again, in these letters, except where I specifically say something aboutchildren, we are talking about adults only.Uncle Ericpicture3 [images/picture3.jpg]The Two Laws iDo all you have agreed to do.Do not encroach on other persons or their property.picture4 [images/picture4.jpg]ASpread the Word©10 For a partial solution to the problem of children's rights, see the\"Agreement Between Parent and Child\" in the appendix.Enforcement of Early Common Law376Enforcement of Early Common LawDear Chris,Now that you know a bit about the early common law you may be asking how thislaw was enforced. If early common law had no connection with government, then ajudge could not use police, troops or prisons to enforce decisions. Could acriminal simply walk away?The short answer is yes. The longer answer is yes but...Suppose one person harmed another. The judge would instruct the offender to makerestitution to the victim. If the offender refused, the judge could then use aprocedure called outlawry.Under outlawry the judge was saying to the perpetrator, \"We will not force thelaw onto you. You have decided to be outside the law, so be it. And, since youdo not accept the responsibilities of the law, neither shall you have itsprotections. From now on your legal status shall be no different from that of arabbit or any other wild animal outside the law.\"The description of this person who had decided to be an outlaw would bepublicized. Then anyone — let me emphasize, anyone—could hunt him down andenslave him, kill him or, perhaps, cook and eat him like a rabbit. It was noneof theWhatever Happened to Justice?court's business, the outlaw had made his choice. The victim might even hire abounty hunter to track the criminal down and sell him as a beast of burden.It's difficult to believe there were many cases in which judges found itnecessary to use outlawry.Of course there was always the possibility someone would make a mistake. Thebounty hunter might capture the wrong person. The police sometimes do thistoday. But under common law the bounty hunter had a mighty incentive to do thejob right. If he harmed an innocent person he could end up an outlaw himself.Courts could make mistakes, too. So, there was an appeal system that enabledpersons who disagreed with decisions to tell their story to a higher court.You may also be interested in the system of restitution. Today when a personharms someone, courts assume he owes a debt to society. He goes to prison wherehe makes license plates for the state. Everyone, including the victim, paysadditional taxes to support him.Under common law the offender's debt was to his victim. His obligation was torestore his victim as nearly as possible to the victim's original condition.This included paying theWANTEDpicture5 [images/picture5.jpg]The word outlaw is from the common law principle of outlawry.Enforcement of Early Common Law39victim for all damages including time lost from work, court expenses, emotionalstress, you name it. A criminal who harmed someone seriously could end up thevictim's slave, and the victim could rent him to other individuals or companies.In the case of an outlaw, the victim could even kill the slave, but thisprobably didn't happen often. A criminal-slave was worth a lot of money. Thevictim would be more likely to sell him rather than do anything that woulddamage him or otherwise reduce his value.Many cultures evolved common law systems. This seems to be a natural tendencyfor humans. Early on, several of these systems came up with detailed lists ofprices for doing harm.Clovis, founder of the Frankish kingdom, had a group of lawyers write down theLex Salica (Law of the Salian Franks) around 508 A.D. This contained a list ofwergild, or restitutions. In a study called birth of France, historian KatharineScherman wrote that in the Lex Salica, \"The criminal's first liability was tothe victim.\"Restitutions were split 50-50 between the victim (or in the case of murder, thevictim's family) and the government that had apprehended him. Prices weredenominated in the bezant gold coin which contained 65 grains of gold and wasequal to about a month's wages. 11For the murder of an adult male, the wergild was 200 bezants. For the murder ofa pregnant woman, 700.Under the category of assault and battery there was a list of prices forinjuring a finger, an ear and other body parts. For putting out an eye thewergild was 100 bezants.Lesser offenses were covered in detail, too. For strokingn Using values derived from wage rates of the late Roman Empire given by RobertL. Schuettinger and Eamonn F. Butler in the 1979 edition of Forty Centuries ofWage and Price Controls, p. 24.Whatever Happened to Justice?a woman's hand against her will, 15 bezants; for touching her bosom, 35; forrape, 62.5.But the Lex Salica said nothing about making license plates for the state.Historian Scherman says imprisonment in those days was rare, as it was undermost common law systems. A person who sits rotting in a jail cell can't earnmoney to pay the debts he owes his victims. And, his victims certainly don'twant to pay higher taxes to support him.If you'd like to convert these prices to modern equivalents, the average wage inthe U.S. today is roughly $2000 per month. So, the cost of stroking a woman'shand against her will would be $30,000.Before we leave the subject of outlawry and restitution, notice how advancedthese systems were. When damage was done, the person who did it was responsiblefor fixing it. This was fifteen centuries ago during the Dark Ages. What doesthis tell you about our legal systems today? Think about it.I recommend a book called early christian Ireland: introduction to the sourcesby Kathleen Hughes (Cornell University Press, 1972). Historian Hughes gives afine description of the insurance organizations the early Irish used forenforcement of their common law and for taking care of victims. By today'sstandards this system was wonderfully sophisticated and effective. It was infull operation in 600 A.D.In my next letter we'll talk about common law's scientific nature. Until then,remember that the ultimate enforcement system for the early common law wasoutlawry, and the offender's first responsibility was to his victim.Uncle EricHow Do We Know If It's Law?417How Do We Know If It's Law?Dear Chris,The primary source of common law was custom. Through trial and error in theirrelationships, people learned the rules that worked, and these rules became law.To prevent trivial whim and opinion from becoming law, courts had guidelines fordeciding if a custom should be law.\"Blackstone provided in his commentaries a clear account of tests which customsshould meet before they were admitted to have the force of law.... Good customis: (1) ancient, no man can remember the beginning of it, (2) continuous, therights claimed under it have never been abandoned or interrupted, (3) peaceable,supported by the common consent of those using the custom, (4) reasonable, inthe light of 'legal' reason, (5) certain, in the sense of being ascertainable,(6) compulsory, it is not left to the opinion of every man whether he will obeyor not, (7) consistent, for one custom cannot contradict another custom withoutproducing an absurdity.\"ORIGINS OF THE COMMON LAWby Arthur R. Hogue42 Whatever Happened to Justice?Notice how few customs meet these tests. This is what enabled common law toremain stable. Also notice the emphasis on reason—if its not logical it's notlaw.Uncle Ericpicture6 [images/picture6.jpg]Logic and Atoms438Logic and AtomsDear Chris,Many years ago there was a mathematician who was interested in physics. With theassistance of his colleagues, he discovered that all matter is composed of tiny,invisible particles which he called atoms. His work led him to the conclusionthat atoms differ from one another in form and position, are constantly inmotion, and are arranged in groups which are now called molecules.None of this mathematician's discoveries are surprising to us today, we are allfamiliar with the basics of nuclear physics. What is surprising is that themathematician was named Democritus and he was a citizen of Greece in 400 B.C. Hemade all his discoveries about the atom without the aid of cyclotrons, nuclearreactors, electron microscopes or other high-tech equipment. The only tool heused was his brain, he used logic.In the past, most judges were similar in thinking to Democritus. They believedit was possible to discover the laws of the universe through logic. And, theydiffered from Democritus only in that they were trying to discover not the lawsof physics but the laws of morality.Whatever Happened to Justice?The common law judges were very aware that law can involve force. The judgeswere trying to discover the principles which would guide them in the use offorce. They wanted the force to be applied only sparingly and only againstpersons who had harmed someone.American founder Thomas Paine wrote, \"Man cannot make principles, he can onlydiscover them.\" This is crucially important. It explains exactly the premise ofboth science and the common law.Under common law, the judge was a sort of combination philosopher and scientist.His task was to discover the principles that make civilizationpossible—principles such as \"Thou shalt not steal\" and \"Thou shalt not murder\" —and apply them in cases brought before him. He was a thinker in the tradition ofDemocritus, Newton, Galileo and the other philosopher-scientists who were tryingto discover how the universe works.This is a major reason lawyers and judges were so highly respected. They had thestatus of scientists. It was their life's work to discover and apply correctmoral principles. Some people today see lawyers as immoral, or at best, amoral.A highly skilled common law judge would try to make all his decisions logicallyconsistent with the two fundamental laws — do all you have agreed to do, and donot encroach on other persons or their property. Any law or decision that wasnot logically consistent with these laws was considered nonsense and was notbinding.This too is important. If it wasn't logical it wasn't law.One of the greatest lawyers in history once made the surprising revelation thatEuclid's geometry was one of his most important law books. He studied it to besure the logic of his cases was airtight. His name was Abraham Lincoln.Logic and Atoms45The merits of Lincoln's presidency are a subject of much debate. His war cost600,000 American lives, more even than the second world war.But Lincoln's career as a lawyer was undeniably stellar, and this was largelybecause of his careful attention to logic.One of the most important characteristics of common law was its certainty. Ithad evolved very carefully over many centuries, changing little from one decadeto the next. The two fundamental laws remained always in place, a stabilizingforce. Investors and business people could expect their economic environment toremain reasonably orderly.In fact, common law was so logical and sensible that the typical Americanstudied it and understood it! It was regarded as a source of wisdom. In hisPulitzer Prize winning book theIDEOLOGICAL ORIGINS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, historianBernard Bailyn writes,\"To the colonists it was a repository of experience in human dealings embodyingthe principles of justice, equity, and rights; above all it was a form ofhistory — ancient, indeed immemorial, history; constitutional and nationalhistory; and, as history, it helped explain the movement of events and themeaning of the present.\"The great British statesman Edmund Burke said of early America, \"In no country,perhaps, in the world, is law so general a study.\" He observed that \"all whoread, and most do read, endeavor to obtain some smattering in that science. Ihave been told by an eminent bookseller, that in no branch of hisbusiness...were so many books as those on law exported to the colonies.\"Whatever Happened to Justice?Notice Burke referred to law as a science. This was a widespread attitude.Charles Warren was assistant attorney general to the U.S. in 1914-18. Indescribing Harvard's early law curiculum, he called law a science.Here's an interesting point. A present-day myth says the early Americans wereilliterate bumpkins who, because they had no schooling, had no education. Farfrom it. British general Thomas Gage was trying to govern Massachusetts in1774-75 when he complained that Americans were impossible to buffalo, they wereall lawyers. 12How many Americans today can read well enough to handle law books?Have you ever read Thomas Paine's common sense? In the freeman magazine,journalist J. Brian Phillips writes,\"common sense had an unprecedented influence on the minds of the Americanpeople. Paine estimated that 150,000 copies were sold in the first year; otherestimates went as high as 500,000 copies. With fewer than three million peoplein the colonies at the time, either figure is astounding. Nearly every adultread the pamphlet.\"By today's standards common sense is heavy reading, college level. These peoplehad to have been well educated, at least by today's standards.Self-teaching is a form of education that sticks, and it can continue and remainenjoyable for life. I hope you'll follow the example of these early Americans.It's probably the only way you'll learn much about common law.12 Law in America by Bernard Schwartz, McGraw-Hill, NY 1974,p. 3.Logic and Atoms47In a future letter we will delve more deeply into the scientific nature ofcommon law. Until then, remember that under the old common law, if it's notlogical it's not law.By the way, I've noticed that this logic in the old common law is what causesmany lawyers to become hooked on law. When they first encounter it in law schoolthey are struck by its wondrous beauty. They know — they feel deep in theirhearts — that they are in the presence of something profound. It's much the samefeeling doctors experience when they study the human body, or astronomers whenthey study the heavens. They sense they are making contact with...what? Too badcommon law is gone.Uncle Ericpicture7 [images/picture7.jpg]Thomas PaineEngraved by Illman & Sons after a painting by George Romney. Reproduced from thedictionary of American portraits, published by Dover Publications, Inc., in1967.Whatever Happened to Justice?\"...one thing you have to say about science: It delivers the goods. If you wantto know when the next eclipse of the Sun will be, you might try magicians andmystics, but you'll do much better with scientists.

There are no forbidden questions in science, nomatters too sensitive or delicate to be probed, no sacred truths. There is anopenness to new ideas combined with the most rigorous, skeptical scrutiny of allideas, a sifting of the wheat from the chaff. Arguments from authority areworthless. It makes no difference how smart, august or beloved you are. You mustprove your case in the face of determined, expert criticism. Diversity anddebate between contending views are valued.\"Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan \"Real Patriots Ask Questions\"PARADE MAGAZINESeptember 8, 1991picture8 [images/picture8.jpg]Ambient Encroachment & Tacit Contracts 499Ambient Encroachment & Tacit Contracts\"Only a virtuous people are capable of freedom. As nations become corrupt andvicious, they have more need of masters.\"Benjamin FranklinDear Chris,In this letter I'll try to clear up two points that can lead to confusion. Thefirst concerns something we might call \"ambient\" encroachment, meaning thesurrounding level of encroachment.Most communities permit a small amount of encroachment. This is an amount widelyaccepted as tolerable or necessary.You can phone someone between the hours of, say, 9AM and 9PM, or you can strollup their front walk and knock on their door. But don't phone them at 3AM ortramp through their flower beds. If you exceed the ambient level ofencroachment, you'll owe them for the inconvenience or damage you've caused.Some individuals permit more encroachment than others. One person may not mindif strangers knock on her back door. Another may want strangers to come only toher front door.50 Whatever Happened to Justice?The safest course is to always err on the side of caution. If you must encroach,be as polite and unintrusive as possible.Try to see it from the other person' s point of view. Your own privacy, peaceand quiet are important to you, so don't disrupt someone else's. Do untoothers...Also, never touch another person or his property unless you are sure you havehis permission. Give him space. He will trust you more and be more friendly andhelpful as soon as he realizes you are trying not to encroach.I've been around the world and in the company of all kinds of people, fromscientists and jet pilots to the most primitive jungle Indians. This workseverywhere.The second point to clear up is that of unspoken contracts. An agreement doesnot need to be in writing to be binding. Most contracts are unspoken or \"tacit.\"If you walk into a grocery store to buy a candy bar, numerous tacit contractsare in force. The first is from the fact that the door is open. By leaving thedoor open the owner is agreeing to allow you to come in as long as you don't doany harm. He hasn't said this to you directly, it's understood and it's binding.The next contract concerns the candy. You are permitted to pick it up andexamine it but not damage it or move it to another location. The owner has notsaid this to you directly but it's understood, or customary, and it's binding.You decide to buy this candy bar, and take it to the register. You lay it on thecounter and the clerk rings it up. You give the money to the clerk, pick up thecandy and leave the store.All this has happened without a word spoken, but a complex agreement has beenexecuted, and it's binding. The store owner has guaranteed that the candy iswhat the wrapper says it is. It's sugar, not salt; almonds not peanuts; and, itwon't poison you.Ambient Encroachment & Tacit Contracts51On your side of this tacit agreement, you are guaranteeing that the money youhand over is the type and amount the owner would reasonably expect. The quartersare genuine U.S. coins, not foreign coins or a slugs, or anything else of lesservalue. (Why quarters for a candy bar today, when I paid a nickel when I was akid? Do you remember the economics you learned through our prior letters?) 13Again, most contracts are unspoken, but they can be very complex, containingnumerous guarantees you don't even think about. These guarantees are binding.To have the best chance of getting the most for your money, get into the habitof asking yourself before every large purchase, \"Exactly what am I agreeing to,and what is the other party agreeing to? What are we guaranteeing to eachother?\"When dealing with friends, bear in mind that friends tend to give each other thebenefit of the doubt when something goes wrong. They are less inclined to defendtheir interests than they are in cases where they are dealing with strangers.This can lead to hard feelings and shattered relationships because a friend canfeel he is getting \"the short end of the stick\" if something goes wrong.So, the more you care about a friend, the more careful you should be aboutclearly stating all parts of any agreement you have with him, especially partsthat answer the question, \"what if something goes wrong?\" The best way to handlemisunderstandings is to prevent them.In making any agreement with a friend, you might want to follow the example ofthe old common law. Specify that if a dispute arises, you will choose a thirdparty acceptable to you both. You will each tell your side of the story to thisthird13 SezWhatever Happened to Penny Candy? by Richard J. Maybury, BluestockingPress, CAWhatever Happened to Justice?party, and you each agree to abide by whatever decision the third party makes.Another point. Your word should be your bond, and you should try to cultivate areputation for this. It will be one of your most valuable possessions, and willopen up opportunities that are not available to others who have reputations forbeing untrustworthy.In other words, honesty can be profitable. People will payextra to deal with someone they are sure is reliable. Do all you have agreed todo.I will finish this letter by mentioning a survival tactic.You've probably noticed that someone who encroaches in small ways may beinclined to encroach in large ways. Similarly, a person who will breakagreements in small ways may be inclined to major fraud.Before getting into any kind of close personal or business relationship, observehow the person behaves in minor situations. If he shows the slightestinclination to encroach, or fudge on agreements, he may be a thug who will hurtyou seriously if he thinks he can get away with it.Try to develop an internal alarm. When you see someone break an agreement orencroach beyond the ambient level, your alarm should alert you: \"Look out,someone who will do that might do anything.\"The best people to deal with are those who are very reluctant to encroach andwho are careful to always give all they have agreed to.Uncle Eric\"Neither the wisest constitution nor the wisest laws will secure the liberty andhappiness of a people whose manners are universally corrupt.\"Samuel Adams\"Fraud; An intentional perversion of truth for the purpose of inducing anotherin reliance upon it to part with some valuable thing belonging to him or tosurrender a legal right.

These two fundamental laws have been more widely obeyed in America, byeveryone, including government officials, than anywhere else. So, America becamethe most advanced nation ever seen on earth. Not until the 1970's did thisadvancement slow.The reason these two fundamental laws create a progressive civilization withincreasing abundance for all is something economists call economic calculation.It sounds complicated but it's not. Here's how it works.picture9 [images/picture9.jpg]Suppose I offer to sell you something, say a pen, for five dollars. I will do soonly if I want the five dollars more thanWhatever Happened to Justice?the pen. You will agree to the trade only if you want the pen more than the fivedollars.In a free trade, both parties end up with something they value more than whatthey traded away. Otherwise they\"In transactions of trade it is not to be supposed that, as in gaming, what oneparty gains the other must necessarily lose. The gain to each may be equal. If Ahas more corn than he can consume, but wants cattle; and B has more cattle, butwants corn; exchange is gain to each; thereby the common stock of comforts inlife is increased.\"Benjamin Franklin, 1706-1790 Signer, Declaration of Independenceof progress.This is economic calculation in action. Humans produce and trade only when theythink it will yield something they want more than the time, money, effort andother factors required for the production and trade.A key word here is think. Economic calculation is difficult, we sometimes makemistakes. Trades occasionally yield accidental losses. We have all had theexperience of doing some kind of work or making a purchase that has us saying,\"I wish I hadn't done that, it wasn't worth it.\"Economic calculation is difficult and some transactions yield losses. But aslong as both parties come to a transaction voluntarily, we know chances are goodit will yield gains for both. Civilization will move slightly ahead.Chris, I should point out here that this is a bit of an oversimplification. Notall profits bring advancement in thewould not go to the trouble of trading.Therefore, in a free trade, both parties profit. Both have their lives slightlyimproved.The sum of all the profits from all the free trades in a society is what we callprogress. Free trade is the sourceEconomic Calculation 57sense of being better off today than yesterday. Here's why.Things break down and wear out. They get used up. Ask your parents about thecost of auto repairs and food, and you '11 know what I'm talking about. Muchprofit goes toward just staying even, toward avoiding decline. So, only aportion of our profits goes toward genuine progress. We need a certain amount ofprofit just to keep from sliding back into the Dark Ages.But to keep things simple, I'll continue speaking in terms of any profit beingprogress. Besides, it's true in a sense. Throughout history, most of mankind haslived in grinding poverty most of the time. If any of our ancestors had seen howwe live now they'd have thought heaven on earth had been achieved. To them,merely staying where we are would be more than anyone could reasonably wish for.Just bear in mind that when I speak of any profit being progress, I'msimplifying to make my explanations easier to grasp.In my next letter we'll see what happens to economic calculation when someoneviolates the two fundamental laws. Until then, remember that free trade is thesource of progress. In a free trade, both parties end up with something theyvalue more than what they traded away. Otherwise they wouldn't go to the troubleof trading.Uncle EricWhatever Happened to Justice?Do You Know Anyone Old Enough To Remember The Beforetime...... when men walked on the moon? (Those under 21 cannot remember, the last moonmission was launched in 1972.)... when new cars and homes were larger and more luxurious each year.... when home ownership was a realistic possibility for most American families... when the typical middle-class family could get ahead with only one personworking outside the home.... when \"real\" wages (adjusted for inflation) rose continually.... when the normal unemployment was only 3-4%, ... when poverty was declining.... when good job opportunities were common. ... when stress was somethingengineers studied.... when single-parent households were unusual.... when most high-school students could read.... when narcotic addiction was almost unknown.... when you never saw a person who was homeless or hungry.... when you could leave your doors unlocked at night.... when it was automatically assumed that each generation of Americans wouldeventually live better than their parents.Recessions aside, the U.S. economy since about 1973 has been suffering from aslowly debilitating disease. Growth in productivity has dropped, thecompetitiveness of industry has declined, the once-steady rise in livingstandards has faltered, and wages have stagnated. Most Americans tell pollstersthat they doubt their children's generation will live as well as they do. TheAmerican dream is fading.Alan Murray \"Outlook,\" Wall Street Journal December 2, 1991Whatever Happened to Justice?11Force or FraudDear Chris,Suppose someone introduces force into the transaction. Suppose a third party — agovernment or a criminal, it does not matter— says you must purchase the peneven if it is not worth five dollars to you. If you don't, you will be punished.We can expect this trade to still yield a profit for me, because I participatevoluntarily, but we cannot expect this for you. For you, the pen may be worthonly four dollars, or it may be worth nothing at all. Perhaps you do not needit. So, the trade may cause you a loss.When the two fundamental laws are not obeyed—when force or fraud enter atransaction—odds are that at least one party will suffer a loss. Someone willgive up something he values more than what he receives in exchange. Civilizationwill move slightly backward.In a government-controlled economy, force is involved in millions oftransactions every day. Anything involving taxes involves force. So, millions oftransactions yield losses every day. People are continually being forced to giveup things they value more than what they get.The presence of force is a near ironclad guarantee of loss.Force or Fraud61If losses were not happening, these people would go along voluntarily.When the government grows large enough, the losses outnumber the gains andcivilization moves backward. We apparently reached this point sometime in theearly 1970's.To summarize, scientific law permits effective economic calculation andprogress. Political law...but that's another story we will cover in letters tocome.These are the essential facts of economic calculation. They tell us free-marketsare the source of America's legendary abundance, and they tell us why the twofundamental laws are necessary for an advancing civilization.Chris, until my next letter, remember that in a free trade, chances are goodthat both parties will profit; civilization will move slightly ahead. But whenforce or fraud enters the transaction, chances are that one or both parties willsuffer a loss; civilization will move backward. The loss may be well hidden but,given enough time, a good economist can spot it.Uncle Eric62 Whatever Happened to Justice?Chains of AgreementsIn a free country we organize ourselves by chains of agreements. The farmeragrees to sell wheat to the mill. The miller agrees to sell flour to the bakery.The baker agrees to sell buns to the restaurant, and the restaurateur agrees tosell dinner to you and me.Each person is a link in the chain, and all rely on each other. If any oneperson breaks his agreement, the chain fails and all end up with less than theyneed.The Lawless West6312The Lawless WestDear Chris,Persons who learn their history from Hollywood movies tend to believe theAmerican West was a land overrun by lawless killers. It sometimes seems thegurus of Tinseltown have spent millions convincing us everything west of theMississippi was gunfights and outlaws until U.S. marshalls arrived.The truth, of course, is much different and much too tame for a movie. DodgeCity and a few other places were wild, but by and large the West was a peacefulplace far less dangerous than most big cities today. It was little house on theprairienot GUNSMOKE.Think about it. Why do we recognize the names Jesse James and Black Bart when wedo not know the names of the criminals who roam the streets of our cities today?Because Jesse James and Black Bart were unusual. Today most cities containhundreds of these thugs, and many are far more bloodthirsty than Jesse James orBlack Bart were in their worst nightmares.Life on a frontier is hard work. This is where we find not the worst but thefinest specimens of mankind. Cities are64 Whatever Happened to Justice?where we find the parasites because cities are where the parasites find the mostvictims.The common law tradition holds that there is no such thing as a lawless place.The law exists, just as the laws of physics and chemistry exist. Even if wechoose not to learn or follow the law, it is still there producing itsinevitable results. Obey the law and life gets better, disobey and life getsworse. It's automatic.The pioneers believed this and lived accordingly. They were law-abiding despitethe absence of police, it was ingrained in them.This more than anything else is what was once meant by the word American. AnAmerican was a person with specific, definable principles. He had character,honor. He obeyed common law even when no police were nearby.Looking outward at the rest of the world, the American saw barbarism, abarbarism caused by the absence of common law principles. The American had madea deliberate, conscious choice to be honorable and civilized. This is how hebuilt the most advanced civilization ever known.Between 1820 and 1940, 38 million people came to America, often risking theirlives to do so. They wanted to live under these principles. This is whyAmericans have always been known as one of the most law-abiding peoples in theworld. They chose to be.In most nations, patriotism is a dedication to the homeland, the geographicarea. America is different. With the possible exception of Switzerland, Americawas the first nation ever to be founded on a set of moral principles. Eventoday, America remains more of an idea than a place. That lump-in-the-throatpatriotism inspired by the Liberty Bell or the Statue of Liberty comes as aresult of what the countryThe Lawless West65means, not where it is.This also points to one of the most fascinating aspects of common law—it trulyis scientifically provable. We can measure the results.The nations in which the two fundamental laws are more widely obeyed—byeveryone, including government officials (\"all men are created equal\")—are thosethat have higher average incomes, less poverty, less crime, longer life spans,better health, more literacy and so forth. By almost any gauge, these nationsare better places to live.See for yourself. Where would you rather live—the U.S. or Russia? Switzerland orEthiopia?The early Americans understood this. They were immigrants who had fled poorernations. To them, the superiority of common law principles was obvious. They hadseen with their own eyes that the more political law a nation had, the greaterthe extremes of wealth and poverty, and the smaller the middle class.Perhaps this gives you a hint of what I'll soon be writing in regard topolitical law.Early Americans also saw immediate, everyday benefits to following the twofundamental laws. This was expressed in sayings such as, honesty is the bestpolicy.French writer and moralist Jean de la Bruyere explained, \"A show of a certainamount of honesty is in any profession or business the surest way of growingrich.\" This is because buyers and employers seek honest people. They don't wantto get ripped off.In my opinion, in America today we place far too much emphasis on intelligenceand too little on character. Intelligence is great, but only if used inhonorable ways. I like George Washington's remark:Whatever Happened to Justice?\"I hope I shall always possess firmness and virtue enough to maintain what Iconsider the most enviable of all titles, the character of an 'Honest Man.' \"What do you think Washington would say about computer viruses? These are smallprograms designed to secretly spread from one computer to another and do damage.They can be written only by a brilliant intellect. Today hundreds of theseviruses are harming millions of innocent people.Virus creators are highly intelligent and highly barbaric. I cannot imagineanything more terrifying than that combination, and I'm afraid it is the wave ofthe future. If we don't find a way to stop it, it will destroy us, and soon.Please tell others about the two fundamental laws.Until my next letter, remember, the two fundamental laws are one part ofreligion (the only part?) that is scientifically provable. Where these laws aremore widely obeyed, life is better.picture10 [images/picture10.jpg]In most nations, patriotism is a dedication to the homeland, the geographicarea. America is different.

Where they are not,life gets worse. It's cause and effect, like the laws of physics and chemistry.Common law was the system for discovering and applying Natural Law in humanaffairs.An important point here concerns good intentions. You might have heard theexpression, \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\"If you jump out of an airplane without a parachute, you know what will happen.It's cause and effect. Even if youNatural Rights69have the best of intentions—even if you are absolutely convinced you can flylike a bird—it won't make any difference. Your intentions cannot repeal NaturalLaw.Cause and effect also exists with natural moral laws. When force or fraud entera transaction, odds are that someone will suffer a loss and civilization willmove slightly backward. Intentions do not matter.Suppose John Q. Citizen is totally convinced that some group of people is inneed and he is therefore entitled to take your money by force to give to them.John Q. Citizen could launch an effort to set up a private charity to help thesepeople, using voluntary means, but let's say he is convinced their need makesthe use of force okay.John Q. Citizen launches a political campaign to persuade the government to takeyour money and give it to the needy. In this case we will say these needypersons are a large corporation that is going broke and will have to lay off itsemployees if it isn't rescued.John Q. Citizen's intentions won't matter. When the money is taken by force, alarge number of people, you included, will suffer losses.Those who suffer will respond. They will now spend much of their time and moneytrying to avoid these losses. Some will do this legally, engaging in taxavoidance. They will hire accountants, lawyers and financial advisors to findtax loopholes for them. Vast amounts of time, effort and wealth will be divertedto unproductive money-shuffling.Others will do it illegally with tax evasion. They will spend time, effort andmoney searching for secret, illegal ways to escape the taxes.The government will retaliate by expanding the tax bureaucracy to catch them.Some will go to prison, and prisonsWhatever Happened to Justice?are expensive. More vast sums of money will be diverted to unproductiveactivity. Losses will multiply and civilization will move backward. Somewhere,somehow, poverty will increase. It's cause and effect.The needy corporation and its employees will be better off, and this will behighly visible because this group will be concentrated in a single location.John Q. Citizen will boast about being their benefactor.But thousands of others will be worse off, although they will be widelyscattered and not noticeable. The fact that they are not noticeable will enableJohn to brag and get away with it. But, despite appearances, civilization willbe held back.Here is an interesting remark by Thomas Paine made in 1792:\"To say that any people are not fit for freedom, is to make poverty theirchoice, and to say they had rather be loaded with taxes than not.\"Notice Paine is saying that without freedom, poverty is automatic. Economiststoday know this is because of economic calculation. When force or fraud enter atransaction, odds are that someone will suffer a loss. This is how the universeis made and we cannot change it. Just like the laws of physics and chemistry.From this theory of Natural Law came the early Americans' belief in the NaturalRights of the individual. Samuel Adams said:\"The Natural Rights of the colonists are these: first, a right to life; second,to liberty; third, to prop-Natural Rights71erty; together with the right to support and defend them in the best manner theycan.\"Because the law that says \"do not encroach\" is a Natural Law made by theCreator, a person has Natural Rights to his life, liberty and property grantedby the Creator. They are a logical extension, the Founders believed. SamuelAdams did an outstanding job of explaining this in his excellent 1772 essay therights of the colonists. 15 I suggest you read it.Chris, an interesting point here is that the early Americans were very likelythe most law-abiding people ever—if we are talking about common law; but ifpolitical law, they were rebels from the start.They came to America specifically to violate the tariffs, trade restrictions,taxes and religious laws of the government. Virtually every colonist disobeyedthese laws. In fact, disobedience to them was the foundation of the economy. FewAmerican industries could have survived if they had paid all the taxes andobeyed all the regulations. John Hancock was known as the Prince of Smugglers.But the early Americans were dedicated to the principles of common law. AtLexington, Concord and other batde-15 The Revolutionary Years edited by Mortimer Adler, Encyclopedia Britannica,Chicago, 1976, p. 65-68\"All men are by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherentrights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by anycompact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life andliberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing andobtaining happiness and safety.\"Virginia Declaration of Rights, 1776Whatever Happened to Justice?fields, hundreds gave their lives for these principles.To my mind, the very best definition of liberty ever written was by Jefferson:\"Rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limitsdrawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add 'within the limitsof the law' because law is often but the tyrant's will, and always so when itviolates the rights of the individual.\"Obviously, Jefferson pulled that definition straight from the second fundamentallaw, do not encroach on other persons or their property.Chris, in my next letter we will continue our discussion of Natural Law. Untilthen, remember the Founders' belief in Natural Law, and that a person is endowedby his Creator with rights to his life, liberty and property.Uncle Ericpicture11 [images/picture11.jpg]John Hancock— \"Prince of Smugglers\"Painting by John Singleton Copley Reproduced from the dictionary of Americanportraits, published by Dover Publications, Inc., in 1967.Natural Rights73\"...natural rights provided the moral philosophic underpinning for the U.S.Declaration of Independence...\"During the 19th and early 20th centuries, natural rights fell into disfavorwith legal philosophers....\"Natural rights theory was largely replaced with legal positivism.

McCulloch, economist (1789-1864)PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL ECONOMYDear Chris,An economy is an ecology. It's not a machine. It's a biological system like aforest or tropical reef, but far more complex. The network of relationships isintricate and fragile. Forcible intervention does damage.Even if the force is applied with the best of intentions, damage happens.As in a forest or tropical reef, the consequences of force might not be apparentin the exact location where the force is applied, but it pops up somewhere. Youlearned this from my previous group of letters about money, inflation,investment cycles and recessions. 17 The legal tender laws have brought16 wealthll Whatever Happened to Penny Candy? by Richard J. Maybury, Bluestocking Press,Placerville, CA.The Human Ecology75America untold hardship, including recessions, depressions, unemployment anddeprivation. The more government we get the more poverty we get.The two fundamental laws are part of the fabric of the universe, like the lawsof physics and chemistry. Where these laws are violated, life gets worse; wherethey are obeyed, life gets better. It's cause and effect.Violators, of course, always hope to avoid the consequences themselves. Butsomeone somewhere pays.Common law was an attempt to insure that the only person who pays is the personwho disobeyed. The idea was to protect civilization by preventing the damagefrom being dispersed— by concentrating it at the point, the individual, whocommitted the violation.Sometimes I think the connection between law and economics was better understoodtwo hundred years ago than it is today. Former U.S. assistant attorney generalCharles Warren once drew attention to the sequence of instruction at Harvard LawSchool in its first decade, 1817-27. Harvard introduced students to law throughthe works of William Blackstone, then taught them economics. First law, theneconomics. As I said in my first letter, economics is only a symptom, the causeis law.Today knowledge of this connection between law and economics has been almostcompletely lost. People study either law or economics but rarely both. Even morerarely are\"Let not him who is houseless pull down the house of another, but let him workdiligently and build one for himself, thus by example assuring that his own oneshall be safe from violence when built.\"Abraham LincolnWhatever Happened to Justice?they shown how the two are intertwined. Now that you know, I hope you will tellothers about economic calculation.Let me emphasize something that should be obvious but is often ignored. Humansare biological organisms. We are like forest creatures, whales and all the rest.Our natural system for survival is not an ocean or a rainforest, it is aneconomy, but an economy is an ecological system every bit as much as theseothers.Chris, common law was the system for discovering the Natural Law that governsthe human ecology. We can learn this law, obey it and reap the rewards, orignore it, our choice. But it's always there producing its inevitable results.Keep in mind that right and wrong are not matters of opinion. They areprinciples we must discover and apply. They are laws of biology for intelligentspecies.By the way, in a future letter I'll explain how our refusal to use common lawhas led to the destruction of forests, reefs and other ecological systems. Whenhumans do not obey the two fundamental laws, they foul not only their ownecology but the ecologies of other creatures, too.Uncle EricP.S. In my next letter I'll enclose a treat—a classic story called \"I Pencil.\"A Two-Sided CoinThe system of liberty is a two-sided coin. Common law was the legal side, andfree markets are the economic side.In a free market, people can produce and sell whatever goods and services theychoose.What guides them to produce what others need? The desire for gain.In his book \"The Wealth of Nations,\" the great economist Adam Smith explainedthat businesspersons earn money by offering goods others wish to buy. To earnmore they must constantly improve these goods so that the goods are in greaterdemand. This is the so-called \"Invisible Hand\" that guides free markets toproduce what people need.\"By directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of thegreatest value, he intends only his own gain.... He is in this, as in many othercases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of hisintention. ...By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that ofsociety more effectually than when he really intends to promote it\"Adam SmithTHE WEALTH GF NATIONSWhatever Happened to Justice?15How Things Get DoneDear Chris,Under the principles of common law, how do people organize themselves? How dothings get done?By applying the first law they use voluntary agreements: one individual's simpleoffer, \"If you will do this for me I will do that for you,\" and another'sanswer, \"I agree.\"The best explanation ever written was by Leonard Read of the Foundation forEconomic Education. His essay, i pencil, is a classic. Enjoy.Uncle EricNo one knows how to make a pencil.I, Pencil79I, Pencilby Leonard E. Read(reprinted by permission of the Foundationfor Economic Education ,Inc, Irving ton-on-H udson, New York 10533)To summarize the philosophy of freedom and marvel at the results, one mustwonder at the mystery of the creation of so simple an item as a lead pencil.Here is a pencil s story as told to Leonard Read in 1958. The pencil's officialname is \"Mongol482.\" Its many ingredients are assembled, fabricated, andfinished in Eberhard Faber Pencil Company, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.I am a lead pencil—the ordinary wooden pencil familiar to all boys and girls andadults who can read and write. Writing is both my vocation and my avocation;that's all I do.You may wonder why I should write a genealogy. Well, to begin with, my story isinteresting. And, next, I am a mystery—more so than a tree or a sunset or even aflash of lightning. But, sadly, I am taken for granted by those who use me, asif I were a mere incident and without background. This supercilious attituderelegates me to the level of the commonplace. This is a species of the grievouserror in which mankind cannot too long persist without peril. For, the wise G.K. Chesterton observed, \"We are perishing for want of wonder, not for want ofwonders.\"Whatever Happened to Justice?I, Pencil, simple though I appear to be, merit your wonder and awe, a claim Ishall attempt to prove. In fact, if you can understand me—no, that' s too muchto ask of anyone—if you can become aware of the miraculousness which Isymbolize, you can help save the freedom mankind is so unhappily losing. I havea profound lesson to teach. And I can teach this lesson better than can anautomobile or an airplane or a mechanical dishwasher because—well, because I amseemingly so simple.Simple? Yet, not a single person on the face of this earth knows how to make me.This sounds fantastic, doesn't it? Especially when it is realized that there areabout one and one-half billion of my kind produced in the U.S.A. each year.Pick me up and look me over. What do you see? Not much meets the eye—there'ssome wood, lacquer, the printed labeling, graphite lead, a bit of metal, and aneraser.Innumerable AntecedentsJust as you cannot trace your family tree back very far, so is it impossible forme to name and explain all my antecedents. But I would like to suggest enough ofthem to impress upon you the richness and complexity of my background.My family tree begins with what in fact is a tree, a cedar of straight grainthat grows in Northern California and Oregon. Now contemplate all the saws andtrucks and rope and the countless other gear used in harvesting and carting thecedar logs to the railroadI, Pencil81siding. Think of all the persons and the numberless skills that went into theirfabrication: the mining of ore, the making of steel and its refinement intosaws, axes, motors; the growing of hemp and bringing it through all the stagesto heavy and strong rope; the logging camps with their beds and mess halls, thecookery and the raising of all the foods. Why, untold thousands of persons had ahand in every cup of coffee the loggers drink!The logs are shipped to a mill in San Leandro, California. Can you imagine theindividuals who make flat cars and rails and railroad engines and who constructand install the communication systems incidental thereto? These legions areamong my antecedents.Consider the millwork in San Leandro. The cedar logs are cut into small,pencil-length slats less than one-fourth of an inch in thickness. These are kilndried and then tinted for the same reason women put rouge on their faces. Peopleprefer that I look pretty, not a pallid white. The slats are waxed and kilndried again. How many skills went into the making of the tint and the kilns,into supplying the heat, the light and power, the belts, motors, and all theother things a mill requires? Sweepers in the mill among my ancestors? Yes, andincluded are the men who poured the concrete for the dam of a Pacific Gas &Electric Company hydroplant which supplies the mill's power!Don't overlook the ancestors present and distant who have a hand in transportingsixty carloads of slats across the nation from California to Wilkes-Barre!Whatever Happened to Justice?Complicated MachineryOnce in the pencil factory—$4,000,000 in machinery and building, all capitalaccumulated by thrifty and saving parents of mine—each slat is given eightgrooves by a complex machine, after which another machine lays leads in everyother slat, applies glue, and places another slat atop—a lead sandwich, so tospeak. Seven brothers and I are mechanically carved from this \"wood-clinched\"sandwich.My \"lead\" itself—it contains no lead at all—is complex. The graphite is mined inSri Lanka. Consider these miners and those who make their many tools and themakers of the paper sacks in which the graphite is shipped and those who makethe string that ties the sacks and those who put them aboard ships and those whomake the ships. Even the lighthouse keepers along the way assisted in mybirth—and the harbor pilots.The graphite is mixed with clay from Mississippi in which ammonium hydroxide isused in the refining process. Then wetting agents are added such as sulfonatedtallow—animal fats chemically reacted with sulfuric acid. After passing throughnumerous machines, the mixture finally appears as endless extrusions—as from asausage grinder—cut to size, dried, and baked for several hours at 1,850 degreesFahrenheit. To increase their strength and smoothness the leads are then treatedwith a hot mixture which includes candelilla wax from Mexico, paraffin wax, andhydrogenated natural fats.My cedar receives six coats of lacquer. Do youI, Pencil83know all of the ingredients of lacquer? Who would think that the growers ofcastor beans the refiners of castor oil are a part of it? They are. Why, eventhe processes by which the lacquer is made a beautiful yellow involve the skillsof more persons than one can enumerate!Observe the labeling. That's a film formed by applying heat to carbon blackmixed with resins. How do you make resins and what, pray, is carbon black?My bit of metal—the ferrule—is brass. Think of all the persons who mine zinc andcopper and those who have the skills to make shiny sheet brass from theseproducts of nature. Those black rings on my ferrule are black nickel. What isblack nickel and how is it applied? The complete story of why the center of myferrule has no black nickel on it would take pages to explain.Then there's my crowning glory, inelegantly referred to in the trade as \"theplug,\" the part man uses to erase the errors he makes with me. An ingredientcalled \"factice\" is what does the erasing. It is a rubberlike product made byreacting rape seed oil from the Dutch East Indies with sulfur chloride. Rubber,contrary to the common notion, is only for binding purposes. Then, too, thereare numerous vulcanizing and accelerating agents. The pumice comes from Italy;and the pigment which gives \"the plug\" its color is cadmium sulfide.No One KnowsDoes anyone wish to challenge my earlier asser-84 Whatever Happened to Justice?tion that no single person on the face of this earth knows how to make me?Actually, millions of human beings have had a hand in my creation, no one ofwhom even knows more than a very few of the others. Now, you may say that I gotoo far in relating the picker of a coffee berry in far off Brazil and foodgrowers elsewhere to my creation, that this is an extreme position. I shallstand by my claim. There isn't a single person in all these millions, includingthe president of the pencil company, who contributes more than a tiny,infinitesimal bit of know-how. From the standpoint of know-how the onlydifference between the miner of graphite in Sri Lanka and the logger in Oregonis in the type of know-how. Neither the miner nor the logger can be dispensedwith, any more than can the chemist at the factory or the worker in the oilfield—paraffin being a by-product of petroleum.Here is an astounding fact: Neither the worker in the oil field nor the chemistnor the digger of graphite or clay nor any who mans or makes the ships or trainsor trucks nor the one who runs the machine that does the knurling on my bit ofmetal nor the president of the company performs his singular task because hewants me. Each one wants me less, perhaps, than does a child in the first grade.Indeed, there are some among this vast multitude who never saw a pencil norwould they know how to use one. Their motivation is other than me. Perhaps it issomething like this: Each of these millions sees that he can thus exchange histiny know-how for the goods and services he needs or wants. I may or may not beamong these items.I, Pencil85No Master MindThere is a fact still more astounding: the absence of a master mind, of anyonedictating or forcibly directing these countless actions which bring me intobeing. No trace of such a person can be found. Instead, we find the InvisibleHand at work. This is the mystery to which I earlier referred.It has been said that \"only God can make a tree.\" Why do we agree with this?Isn't it because we realize that we ourselves could not make one? Indeed, can weeven describe a tree? We cannot, except in superficial terms. We can say, forinstance, that a certain molecular configuration manifests itself as a tree. Butwhat mind is there among men that could even record, let alone direct, theconstant changes in molecules that transpire in the life span of a tree? Such afeat is utterly unthinkable!I, Pencil, am a complex combination of miracles: a tree, zinc, copper, graphite,and so on. But to these miracles which manifest themselves in Nature an evenmore extraordinary miracle has been added: the configuration of creative humanenergies—millions of tiny know-hows configurating naturally and spontaneously inresponse to human necessity and desire and in the absence of any humanmaster-minding! Since only God can make a tree, I insist that only God couldmake me. Man can no more direct these millions of know-hows to bring me intobeing than he can put molecules together to create a tree.The above is what I meant when writing, \"If you can become aware of themiraculousness which I86 Whatever Happened to Justice?symbolize, you can help save the freedom mankind is so unhappily losing.\" For,if one is aware that these know-hows will naturally, yes, automatically, arrangethemselves into creative and productive patterns in response to human necessityand demand—that is, in the absence of governmental or any other coercivemaster-minding—then one will possess an absolutely essential ingredient forfreedom: a faith in free men. Freedom is impossible without this faith.Once government has had a monopoly of a creative activity such, for instance, asthe delivery of the mails, most individuals will believe that the mails couldnot be efficiently delivered by men acting freely. And here is the reason: Eachone acknowledges that he himself doesn't know how to do all the things incidentto mail delivery. He also recognizes that no other individual could do it. Theseassumptions are correct. No individual possesses enough know-how to perform anation's mail delivery any more than any individual possesses enough know-how tomake a pencil. Now, in the absence of faith in free men—in the unawareness thatmillions of tiny know-hows would naturally and miraculously form and cooperateto satisfy this necessity—the individual cannot help but reach the erroneousconclusion that mail can be delivered only be governmental \"masterminding.\"Testimony GaloreIf I, Pencil, were the only item that could offer testimony on what men canaccomplish when free to try,I, Pencil87then those with little faith would have a fair case. However, there is testimonygalore; it's all about us and on every hand. Mail delivery is exceedingly simplewhen compared, for instance, to the making of an automobile or a calculator or agrain combine or a milling machine or to tens of thousands of other things.The lesson I have to teach is this: Leave all creative energies uninhibited.Merely organize society to act in harmony with this lesson. Let society's legalapparatus remove all obstacles the best it can. Permit these creative know-howsfreely to flow. Have faith that free men will respond to the Invisible Hand.This faith will be confirmed. I, Pencil, seemingly simple though I am, offer themiracle of my creation as testimony that this is a practical faith, as practicalas the sun, the rain, a cedar tree, the good earth.hqNo one knows how to make a pencil.\"Were we directed from Washington when to sow, and when to reap, we should soonwant bread.\"Thomas Jefferson, 1821Whatever Happened to Justice?16Political LawDear Chris,Now we'll get into political law. This is the law we have today. It is made uplaw, created out of nothing. Whatever the powerholders say is law. And, if theychange their minds, the law changes.During the twentieth century the entire world has been switching over topolitical law and now the transition is almost complete.This transition has many causes. Perhaps the most important was the GreatDepression of the 1930's. In those days people didn't understand enougheconomics to know the depression was caused by inflation. You and many othersunderstand this today 18 , but only a handful knew it then.Not understanding the cause, they became desperate and frightened. They demandedtheir governments do something, anything, even if this meant a massive expansionof the use of force on persons who had not harmed anyone. Political law sweptthe world.In an attempt to stop the depression, governments flooded1 Explained in Whatever Happened to Penny Candy? published by BluestockingPress, Placerville, CA.Political Law89the earth with new laws. It was one legal experiment after another, with verylittle regard for the two fundamental laws.As you have probably already guessed, political law isn't just a different kindof law from the old common law, it is the opposite. It is based on politicalpower—on brute force—not on the two fundamental laws; it's crude and primitive.Political law has no requirement for logic or morality. It changes whenever thepolitical wind changes. Fickle and tangled, no one understands it.Democracy or dictatorship, it doesn't matter, political law is arbitrary. You dowhatever the powerholders say, or else, even if it's morally wrong.This is why majority rule has so often become mob rule. Remember the Reign ofTerror growing out of the French Revolution? The Salem Witch trials? The U.S.government's slaughter of the American Indians?The majority is as human as any dictator. Like the dictator, they do not votefor what is right, they vote for what they want.Their wants change constantly, so political law has no stability. It destroysinvestors' and businessmen's ability to plan ahead. Economic progress becomesvery difficult.Imagine trying to play a game of baseball while the audience is voting every fewminutes to change the rules. This is the situation employers and investors arein now.My, how the law has changed. In 1897, Supreme Court Justice Oliver WendellHolmes, Jr. defined law as \"system-ized prediction.\" He said, \"The prophecies ofwhat the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I meanby the law.\" 19 Now, no one has the slightest idea what the courts will do, thelaw changes daily.19 \"The Path of the Law,\" by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., Law, edited by SaraRobbins, Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1990, pg. 276.Whatever Happened to Justice?America's Founders understood the dangers of political law. James Madison askedin the federalist papers,\"What prudent merchant will hazard his fortunes in any new branch of commercewhen he knows not that his plans may be rendered unlawful before they can beexecuted?\"When merchants do not hazard their fortunes, new businesses are not created andworkers are not hired. We get more unemployment and poverty.The American Revolution was fought over the difference between scientific lawand political law. Government officials had been expanding their encroachmentinto the private businesses, lives and property of the colonists. The colonistssaid the officials had no right to do this. \"All men are created equal.\" God hasgiven no one special permission to encroach on others. No one, not evengovernment officials. Thomas Jefferson:\"A recent survey by the Conference Board, a group of3600 organizations in morethan 50 nations, reports that for fear of civil liability:• 47% of U.S. manufacturers have withdrawn products from the market;• 25% of U.S. manufacturers have discontinued some forms of product research;• Approximately 15% of U.S. companies have laid off workers as a direct resultof product liability experience.\"WALL STREET JOURNALAugust 14,1991Political Law91\"The general spread of the light of science has already laid open to every viewthe palpable truth that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles ontheir backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride themlegitimately by the grace of God.\"In one of the earlier attempts to state the two fundamental laws, Jefferson madethis remark in 1809:\"Reading, reflection and time have convinced me that the interests of societyrequire the observation of those moral precepts only in which all religionsagree, for all forbid us to murder, steal, plunder, or bear false witness.\"The Founders believed the principles of the old common law were superior topolitical law. After the revolution, they created the Bill of Rights and otherdocuments based on these ancient principles. The goal was to make thesuperiority of these principles permanent, and to keep officials restrained bythem.But during this century the restraints have been broken. All we have left ispolitical law. We are forced to do whatever the voters or their electedrepresentatives say.Chris, this is a good place to introduce an extremely important clergyman namedJonathan Mayhew, whom President John Adams called a \"transcendent genius.\" 20 In1750, Mayhew gave a sermon that Adams said, \"was read by everybody.\" 21w The Revolutionary Years by Mortimer J. Adler, Encyclopedia Britannica,Chicago, 1976, p. 21 and 306. 21 Ibid.92 Whatever Happened to Justice?The sermon was a deep exploration of religious principles relating to theauthority of human governments. In it, May-hew described what the government wasdoing and pointed out that this violated Higher Law. He told the audience that aking's authority is legitimate when the king obeys Higher Law, but when theking...\"...turns tyrant and makes his subjects his prey to devour and to destroyinstead of his charge to defend and cherish, we are bound to throw off ourallegiance to him and to resist.\" 22Mayhew pulled no punches:\"We may safely assert...that no civil rulers are to be obeyed when they enjointhings that are inconsistent with the commands of God. ... All commands runningcounter to the declared will of the supreme legislator of heaven and earth, arenull and void; and therefore disobedience to them is a duty, not a crime.\" 23Not just the king, \"no civil rulers,\" said Mayhew, are to be obeyed if theirrules are inconsistent with \"the commands of God.\"According to John Adams, this sermon was the real beginning of the AmericanRevolution. It showed the people that they had to choose between their God's lawand their22 Ibid. ^Ibid.Political Lawgovernment's law. 24 Fortunately, enough had the courage to choose the pathAdams chose, and this led to creation of the most free and prosperous nationever seen on earth.President John Quincy Adams once explained that, \"the virtue which had beeninfused into the Constitution of the United States, and was to give to its vitalexistence\" was that it would be \"always subordinate to a rule of right andwrong, and always responsible to the Supreme Ruler of the universe.\" 25Americans today sometimes assume the Founders' references to God or Nature orthe Supreme Ruler were just for impact or for propaganda. Not so. These weretightly reasoned statements of legal principles. Your rights to your life,liberty and property came from your Creator not the government; these rightscannot be repealed.Chris, in my next letter I'll tell you more about the differences betweenpolitical law and scientific law, or common law.

There were courts beforethere was law. If you don' t remember anything else from my letters, rememberthat. The court came first, then came the common law, which was an attempt toreflect Natural Law.Just like physics and chemistry. First comes the scientist, then comes theequations and formulas.Notice that the equations and formulas are not the laws of physics or chemistry,they are only approximations. Scientists are always trying to make them moreaccurate.The same with common law. The judges believed there is a law, higher than anyhuman law, and they were trying to discover and apply this Higher Law. It wasbeing carefully, logically worked out, case by case, century after century,exactly like the laws of physics and chemistry. Common law was the result—theequations and formulas.Whatever Happened to Justice?Compare this process to the efforts made by your own parents. They are alwaysasking themselves, \"What's fair?\" As they learn, rules are improved.Your parents are not trying to create rules out of nothing. They don't ask,\"What should I make right?\" They ask, \"What is right and what should I do aboutit?\" Right and wrong already exist; your parents would be shocked if someonesuggested they had the power to change them.I've long felt that parenting would be much easier if parents knew common law.Most serious problems arising from human relationships were worked out centuriesago in the common law courts. Common law was packed with helpful insights.Without it, parents today are reinventing the wheel. (Parents, see For FurtherReading, page 237).When Ludwig von Mises, F. A. Hayek and other economists discovered theconnection between law and economic calculation, this was like Newton's flash ofinsight about gravity when he saw the apple fall from the tree. \"So that's howthe world works!\" See Mises' short article \"Economic Calculation in a SocialistCommonwealth,\" and his books socialism and planned chaos. Also see Hayek's NobelPrize winning book road to serfdom available from the Foundation for EconomicEducation.Political law, on the other hand, is an enactment process.Legislators—lawmakers—make changes according to whatever political pressuresthey happen to be feeling at the moment. Something that is right today can bewrong tomorrow and right again the next day. There are no eternal truths, and nointerest in discovering Natural Law.Political law is shallow.Under political law the frequent changing of right and wrong is considered good.Running for re-election, lawmak-Discovery vs. Enactment97ers proudly boast of the number of new laws they have have enacted.In short, we now live in a world where it is assumed politicians have the divinepower to make up law; they have become deities. In 1788, Patrick Henry realizedthis could happen. During his struggle to prevent creation of the federalgovernment 26 he warned that \"Congress, from their general powers, may fully gointo the business of human legislation.\" Henry's warning was ignored and fewpeople today see human legislation as the primitive and arbitrary system that itis.business week says that each year in the U.S. there are more than 100,000 newlaws, rules and regulations enacted. This is the most important reason theeconomy is becoming so rickety. Tax rates, money supply, trade restrictions,licensing laws and thousands of other business ground rules are forever beingstirred around like a witch's brew. This causes money to slosh from one area toanother in unpredictable ways. Employers can't plan ahead.A study done a few years ago showed that between 1976 and 1986, statelegislatures made up 248,000 new laws. On average each of these laws spawned atleast ten new regulations that have the force of law. This means, in effect, thestate legislatures alone made up more than two million new laws. 27 Think aboutit. Two million new laws! And, this doesn't include laws made up by federal andlocal officials.26 Few Americans today remember anything about Patrick Henry and theAnti-Federalists. A good introduction is The Anti-Federalists by Jackson TurnerMain, W.W. Norton & Co., 1961.27 \"Prolific Part-Timers in the Statehouses,\" by Robert S. McCord, wall streetjournal, January 21, 1987, p. 22.Whatever Happened to Justice?If you break one, remember ignorance of the law is no excuse.\"It will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of theirown choice if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or soincoherent that they cannot be understood.\"James Madison Federalist Paper #62\"We have ten times more laws than our great-grandparents had.\"Robert S. McCordWALL STREET JOURNALJanuary 21, 1987Imagine if a scientist claimed he had made up a law of physics or chemistry.He'd be carted away to a lunatic asylum.As we'd expect, much of political law is complete fantasy. In theTRENTON PICKLE ORDINANCE AND OTHER BONE-HEAD legislation, journalist Dick Hymancites 600 examples of America's political law.In Massachusetts, says Hyman, it is illegal to put tomatoes in clam chowder. InSouth Carolina you are breaking the law if your trousers have hip pockets. InVermont it is against the law to whistle under water.\"The world's businessmen understand that the U.S. legal system is a runningjoke, and trade tales that start, have-you-heard-this-one-yet?\"wall street journal editorial August 14,1991Discovery vs. Enactment99A Texas law says that when two trains meet at a railroad crossing, each shallcome to a full stop and neither shall proceed until the other has gone.My favorite is this: The Arkansas legislature once enacted a law forbidding theArkansas River to rise higher than the Main Street bridge in Little Rock.Did you laugh at these examples? Think about this. You were laughing at the law.If decent, honest middle-class Americans will laugh at the law, how can weexpect anyone else to take it seriously? I sometimes fear we are much closer tochaos than we realize.Go back to my seventh letter and reread Edmund Burke's remark about ourforefathers' study of law. Burke refers to this law as a science. Would any saneperson today call our law a science?Human legislation is arbitrary and primitive. It belongs to the era of stoneknives and bearskins. But it has been revived and it now rules our modern worldof computers, lasers and space satellites.Imagine a cave man at the controls of a Boeing 747. This is our situation.Medical doctor Ron Paul spent four terms in Congress. In a conversation he oncetold me that many proposed laws are hundreds of pages long, and few are read bylawmakers before they are voted on—there isn't time. Think about that. Lawmakersthemselves are ignorant of the laws they are making up.Dr. Paul once proposed a new rule for the House. Before voting, a lawmaker wouldhave been required to sign a statement saying (1) he had read the proposed law,(2) he understood it and (3) he knew a way to finance it.

It can affectyour pocketbook. In 1984 I wrote a special report, investment frauds, rip-offsand cons, 28 to help investors avoid swindlers. Here is an excerpt from theintroduction:\"A major requirement for successful investing is the constant awareness thatthere is a new religion in the world. The god of this new religion isgovernment, and the ritual the worshippers perform is legislation. Faith in thisnew religion is deep and profound. The worshippers are convinced their god cansolve almost any problem, if only the right legislation can be performed.\"This new religion is so popular you could probably make a strong case that itis replacing the oldPublished by World Perspective Communications, Orlando, FL.Our New Religion103religions. It's even been embraced by people who should know better. Thesepeople are like the economist described by author Gita Meitta in her book karmacola. The economist felt the need for spiritual guidance, so she flew to Indiato consult with a Hindu guru. The consultation did not yield the desiredguidance, however, and the economist reacted by complaining that the Indiangovernment 'should definitely have a quality control on gurus.'\"There is an abundance of legislation for every problem known to mankind,especially financial problems. The worshippers are convinced this legislation istruly protecting them against financial rip-offs, so they feel less need toprotect themselves.\"\"The ritual does not work. The god is a false god, and we are on our own.\"Many years have passed since I wrote those words but today I believe them morethan ever. Political law has become the world's new religion and it is replacingthe old ones. Legislators have become priests, and capi-tol buildings havebecome temples. None of it has the slightest connection with reality.I recently visited the state capitol building inSacramento. The interior resembles a cathedral. I had the strangest compulsionto keep my head bowed, to speak in'7/ is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law so much as for theright.\"Henry David Thoreau 1849Whatever Happened to Justice'whispers and kneel.This new religion is more entrenched in America than anywhere else. Our tendencyto use law for every problem has become so strong that our demand for lawyershas become insatiable. America has five percent of the world's population butseventy percent of the lawyers. 29 Our adult population of 190 million files 18million lawsuits each year. 30All of it involves force. As Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist Paper #15,\"It is essential to the idea of a law that it be attended with a sanction; or,in other words, a penalty or punishment for disobedience. If there be no penaltyannexed to disobedience, the resolutions or commands which pretend to be lawswill, in fact, amount to nothing more than advice or recommendation.\"This is why, in a civilized society, law is the last resort, the measure usedonly after everything else has been tried.In America today law has become the first resort. Americans have decided, Whyuse a peaceful handshake to solve a problem when you can use a blackjack?Chris, do not be fooled into thinking you are safe from rip-offs just becausethey are illegal. Protection of innocent persons is now just one of the hundredsof purposes of law. It probably isn't even a top priority any more.Uncle Eric29 Wall Street Journal, August 14, 1991, p.

This would be an outrageous idea that would raise eyebrows amonglegal scholars everywhere.Common law wasn't perfect. Far from it. Overlaid by centuries of politicaltinkering—by the blackjack mentality— it was a bit crazy in places. Even theAmerican Founders were somewhat skeptical of it. In Federalist Paper #15Hamilton praised Americans:\"Is it not the glory of the people of America that, whilst they have paid adecent regard to the opinions of former times and other nations, they have notCommon Law Wasn't Perfect 107suffered a blind veneration for antiquity, for custom or for names, to overrulethe suggestions of their own good sense, the knowledge of their own situation,and the lessons of their experience?\"Obviously, one of the craziest parts of common law was the ruling added in latercenturies that it could be changed by statutes—by political law. This was anexact contradiction of everything common law stood for. It was like a physicistsaying E=MC 2 is the law of relativity until we vote to change it. Not verybright.We need to return to common law, yes, but to a purer form, one more tightlybound to the two fundamental laws. For many issues, the courts need to startfresh, at the point where all major religions and philosophies agree. They needto build up new case law—new precedents—from there. Do all you have agreed todo, and do not encroach on other persons or their property.Incidentally, I always try to say \"major\" religions and philosophies. Everyculture has cults and individuals who believe force used on the innocent is fineif it's done for good reasons. I suppose for these persons all that could bedone is to point out to them that if they don't like our law they can alwayschoose to be outside it.Let's look a little closer at the imperfections in the common law.The origin of common law was in the Dark Ages, a time of ignorance andsuperstition. Parts of this ignorance and superstition remained until moderntimes. As late as a hundred years ago, women were not considered fully equal.Skin color had a lot to do with determining a person's guilt or innocence.Whatever Happened to Justice?Courts of equity were invented to correct some of these ancient distortions.These courts were required to place principle above precedent. They did makesome effective repairs to the common law. In most of America, equity and commonlaw were eventually merged into one system.Another reason repairs were needed is that throughout its history the common lawhad been under assault by political lawmakers who objected to the \"do notencroach\" law. They thought they were above this rule. Common law judges whosaid no one was above the law were sometimes persecuted when they refused toenforce political law. More political precedents crept in.In medieval England so many judges refused to enforce political law thatlawmakers invented a whole new court system. This was the Star Chamber whichused torture and murder to enforce the politicians' whims.So, despite efforts to maintain the integrity of common law, as the centuriespassed, it was gradually overlaid by political law. This layer of political lawgrew thicker until the 1930' s when real common law was completely overwhelmed.But until the 1930's, common law worked well most of the time. It was aconscious effort aimed in a specific direction— truth and justice—and the peopleunderstood it and supported it. It was based on their religious beliefs. Also,it was mostly logical and its aims were moral. It tried to avoid using theblackjack.Political law has no aim, other than to obtain and use political power forwhatever the powerholders decide.Common law was the most advanced legal system ever known and it gave birth toAmerica's founding philosophy. Its principles were those the Minutemen and Sonsof Liberty were fighting for in the 1776revolution, and which formed the basisof the Bill of Rights.Common Law Wasn't PerfectI should point out that if you talk to people about common law, you'll find manyadvocates of political law who have been taught misconceptions about common law.One of America's top economists once said to me that no serious person couldbelieve in common law because it was so crazy. As an example he pointed to theearly years of the common law when chemistry and other sciences were notavailable for scientific proofs of innocence and guilt. To decide cases, theplaintiff and defendant engaged in combat. The assumption in those days was thatGod would strengthen the arm of the innocent. The economist laughed at thisprimitive notion, and asked if I would want to live under a legal system sobarbaric.Trial by combat did exist in early common law, it's true. But a bit of researchsheds more light on the matter. In the excellent classic extraordinary populardelusions and the madness of crowds published in 1841, law professor CharlesMackay wrote:\"The clergy, whose dominion was an intellectual one, never approved of a systemof jurisprudence which tended so much to bring all things under the rule of thestrongest arm. From the first they set their faces against dueling, andendeavored, as far as the prejudices of their age would allow them, to curb thewarlike spirit, so alien from principles of religion. In the Council ofValentia, and afterwards in the Council of Trent, they excommunicated allpersons engaged in dueling; and not only them, but even the assistants andspectators, declaring the custom to be hellish and detestable, and introduced bythe devil for the destruction both of body and soul. They added also, thatWhatever Happened to Justice?princes who connived at duels should be deprived of all temporal power.\"Certainly a different picture of common law than the economist had been given,yes? If you haven't read Mackay' s book please do so, it's great.Chris, in my next letter we'll look more closely at political law. Until then,remember that common law wasn't perfect. It had many flaws, but it was the bestmankind had done so far.Uncle Eric\"The respective colonies are entitled to the common law of England, and moreespecially to the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peersof the vicinage 31 according to the course of that law.\"Continental Congress October 14,177431 Local area.11120Liberty vs. PermissionDear Chris,Today's law assumes rights can be granted by the government. However, what thegovernment gives it can also take away. So, under political law we have no realrights and no real liberty, only permissions.We do not have freedom of speech, we have permission to speak. We do not havefreedom of the press, we have permission to publish. Whatever free trade we haveleft is only permission to trade.These permissions can be revoked any time the power-holders decide to revokethem. Majority rule.Courts today do not seek justice, they enforce law. The courts have no conceptof justice—no notion of right and wrong—except whatever the law says.There was a day when two people who had a disagreement would say, \"We'll let acourt decide.\" Today the suggestion of a lawsuit is a threat, an act ofaggression. Everyone knows that the expense of a lawsuit will be outrageous andthe outcome based not on known principles but on the whims of an arbitrary legalsystem.The notion that an innocent person has nothing to worryWhatever Happened to Justice?about is laughable. We all know people who have been dragged into court andseriously mistreated, perhaps even bankrupted by the cost, even though they haddone nothing to harm anyone.In short, to threaten a lawsuit is, itself, an assault.Today's legal system is not a way to prevent harm, it is a way to cause it. It'sa weapon.Under political law we do not have any more genuine liberty than did theSoviets. Our \"rights\" can be erased.Under scientific law, the individual's fundamental rights to his life, libertyand property were held to be gifts granted by the Creator, not by government.These rights could not be erased. Says Arthur R. Hogue in origins of the commonlaw, \"The common law is marked by a doctrine of the supremacy of law. ... Allagencies of government must act upon established principles.... The king, likehis subjects, was under the law.\"Attempts to rescue our civilization will fail if we continue living underpolitical law, that is, under the blackjack mentality. Even if hundreds offree-market politicians were elected and sweeping free-market reforms wereenacted, all these reforms could be reversed when the next group of politicianscame to power.Chris, until my next letter remember that under political law we have no genuineliberties, only permissions, and these permissions can be revoked.

In a 1986 wall street journal article, 32 Justice Department publicaffairs director Terry Eastland wrote,\"Until this century the jurisprudence prevailing since the U.S. foundinginsisted on a core of principles in the law that were knowable and could beapplied in specific cases by judges. In the first decades of this centurydissents from the view became more and more frequent. By the 1930's, the idea ofthe judge as an interpreter of established law had been almost totally rejected.As a result of the work of the Legal Realists and others, a new perspectivedeveloped — that the law is not found by judges, but is made by theirinterpretations of constitutions and statutes.\"\"January 10,1986.Whatever Happened to Justice?One terrible result of this idea that law can be made is complete instability inthe law. We don't know who is responsible for what.This disaster has been described by American Insurance Association vicepresident Dennis Connolly. 33 \"The system is changing,\" says Connolly, \"so thatit is no longer possible to predict the responsibility of parties for actionswhich create injuries, and it is no longer possible to ascertain who will payfor what injuries.\"Legal scholar Victor Schwartz adds, \"There isn't one rule of law that's stable.There is no rule of law that we can assume will be the same three or four yearsfrom now.\" 34 We can't plan ahead.Lawmaking is the reason the abortion question may be the most important questionin all of American history. I do not exaggerate. Here's the story.The second fundamental law, do not encroach on other persons or their property,requires a definition of persons. What is a person?The question may sound silly but it has long been one of the most important anddifficult to answer. Who has a right to life?In centuries past, when women were property and blacks were slaves, the answerwas not so clear. But legal scholars labored away until finally, by thiscentury, almost everyone recognized that if white males have a right to life, sodo women and blacks. We are all created equal.Unfortunately, this is as far as the common law progressed before it wasoverwhelmed by political law. Many questions about rights to liberty andproperty, especially the liberty and33 ABC Nightline, December 26, 1985. 34 Ibid.Instability, Nuremberg and Abortion 117property of children, remain unanswered. Or they are answered arbitrarily bypolitical law, majority rule.Also unanswered are right-to-life questions related to animals and fetuses. Weknow the right to life is somehow connected to intelligence. If someday we meeta Mr. Spock or ET, or some other intelligent alien from another planet, thisalien will have a right to life even if he isn't human.But this is the limit of the common law's advancement. How intelligent does thecreature need to be? Is the right to life connected to factors other thanintelligence? How do we measure intelligence?The whole topic of rights remains fuzzy, and so we have no guidelines for modernquestions such as abortion, terminal illness or euthanasia. I'm most concernedabout abortion.If an abortion is performed in the 36th week of a pregnancy, anyone would callthis premeditated first degree murder. No one would object much if the motherand doctor were both sent to prison for a long, long time.But suppose the abortion were performed in the first week? Should they go toprison then?Where do we draw the line? Why there?For miscarriages occurring in the first or second month, few people havefunerals. Why?Rights seem to be attached to intelligence. But we don't know what level ofintelligence, or how to measure it. To be within the protection of the law, howsmart is smart enough?Suppose an adult suffers extensive brain damage from an illness or accident. Iseuthanasia okay? Most would say no as long as any brain activity is detecrable.To kill a person while the brain is operating even on a very low level ismurder.But an adult chimpanzee is more intelligent than a human infant. Is it murder tokill a chimpanzee?Whatever Happened to Justice?To kill a dolphin? A dog? How smart is smart enough?A dog could easily be more intelligent than a braindamaged human.Where do we draw the line, and why there?The question remains unanswered and we no longer have a trustworthy mechanism toanswer it. All we have is political law—majority rule. If the majority of thevoters or their representatives decide abortion in the first week is murder,it's murder. If they decide it isn't, it isn't. And if they change their minds,so be it. This is exactly what happened in Nazi Germany to Jews.Set the abortion question aside for a moment, we'll come back to it.Originally in Germany the killing of any innocent human was held to be murder.Then political leaders acquired the power to change the law, and judges wentalong. Exceptions crept in. First it was persons held to be mentallyincompetent. Then other \"undesirables\" became exceptions, until finally millionswere killed. Legally.In 1946, political law was exposed for the barbaric system it is.At the Nuremberg trials the Nazi defendants claimed they were innocent ofwrongdoing because they had been following orders.They were within their nation's laws, this is true. But the prosecution arguedthat \"there is a higher duty\" than anything our governments can impose on us.The judges agreed: \"The fact that the defendant acted pursuant to order of hisgovernment or of a superior shall not free him from responsibility.\" Thedefendants were executed.This was a bold decision, and I believe it was the mostInstability, Nuremberg and Abortion119important legal decision of the 20th century. It was a barefaced admission that(1) there is a Higher Law than any government's law, (2) we are all obliged toobey this law and (3) courts must seek out and enforce this Higher Law.Ever since, governments have done their best to bury the significance of theNuremberg decision. They have largely succeeded. Today no one searches forHigher Law. Schools teach nothing about it. Few students know anything aboutNuremberg.This is why the abortion question is terrifying to me. The eventual resolutionwill very likely come through a constitutional amendment. And, pro or con, theanswer will be important, but not half as important as the method ofanswering—through political means."},{"pageContent":"A right-to-life question will have been decided by majority rule.

Nine-hundredAmericans were told by their leader Jim Jones to kill themselves, and they did.There's nothing new about mass lunacy. In the 1841 preface to extraordinarypopular delusions and the madness of crowds, attorney Mackay wrote:\"Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad inherds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.\"Mackay's book is a long series of stories about such mass insanities as theCrusades, Tulipomania, The Mississippi Scheme, witch trials, and popularadmiration of famous thieves.In the origins of totalitarianism, Hannah Arendt reminds us,\"Hitler's rise to power was legal in terms of majority rule and neither he norStalin could haveDemocracy and the Constitution121maintained the leadership of large populations, survived many interior andexterior crises, and braved numerous dangers of the relentless intra-partystruggles if they had not had the confidence of the masses.\"The great American financier Bernard Baruch said, \"Anyone taken as an individualis tolerably sensible and reasonable—as a member of a crowd, he at once becomesa blockhead.\" Baruch earned millions by exploiting the crowd mentality of theinvestment markets.I don't know the reason for this crowd mentality. Perhaps humans are packanimals. They seem to have an insatiable desire for leaders who will tell themhow to think and act. Individualism is rare.It's a mystery for psychologists and sociologists to solve. But America'sFounders had to deal with it. As soon as the state governments becameindependent, these governments became more democratic, and more crazy.They went wild printing money, and caused a runaway inflation that led to adepression. The depression led to an armed uprising called Shay's Rebellion.The state governments levied tariffs and other trade restrictions on citizens ofneighboring states. Some officials even threatened war against neighboringstates. Historians call this time of madness in America \"The Critical Period.\"The blackjack mentality was running wild.The Constitution and federal government were created as a control on the states.This was the Founders' way of stopping the democratic drift toward mob rule.In other words, at the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia they weretrying to thwart democracy to protect liberty.Whatever Happened to Justice?In fact, as far as I know, no one in the American Revolution was interested indemocracy. Read the literature of 1776, try to find any mention of it.Everywhere you will find demands for liberty, but little or nothing aboutdemocracy. The Constitution says nothing about democracy.The Founders did not like democracy and they did not trust it. They wantedliberty.Indeed, as citizens of Britain, the early Americans probably already had moredemocracy than any other nation. To a large extent, this is what the war wasabout. The American colonists were a minority of the British population, whichwas governed by parliament's majority rule. Even if every one of the colonistscould have voted they probably could not have stopped parliament from votingagainst them. The Stamp Act, the Intolerable Acts and other offensivelegislation would have been enacted anyhow. If you are a member of a minority,living under majority rule just isn't all that great. Having your ownrepresentative in the legislature can be of some help, but if you can't persuadethe majority to protect you, you're helpless.picture15 [images/picture15.jpg]Democracy and the Constitution123The Founders studied the democracies of ancient Greece and other nations beforethey created the Constitution. In Federalist #10, James Madison wrote:\"Such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; haveever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property;and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent intheir deaths.\"In Federalist #50 he worried that,\"The passions, therefore, and not the reason, of the public would sit injudgment/'In speaking of the masses, Alexander Hamilton said:\"The voice of the people has been said to be the voice of God; and, howevergenerally this maxim has been quoted and believed, it is not true to fact. Thepeople are turbulent and changing, they seldom judge or determine right.\"picture16 [images/picture16.jpg]Of all the Founders, Jefferson was probably the most trusting of the voters. Butnot even he would entertain for one minute the idea of unlimited majority rule.In an earlier letterWhatever Happened to Justice?I mentioned his remark,\"It is strangely absurd to suppose that a million human beings collectedtogether are not under the same moral rules as bind each of them separately.\"Jefferson trusted farmers because of their work ethic, their ownership ofproperty and their inability to form into large crowds. As for those of us whoaren't farmers:\"The mobs of the great cities add just so much to the support of puregovernment, as sores do to the strength of the human body\"He was very much afraid that the government would begin making exceptions to theprinciples that make liberty possible:\"A departure from principle in one instance becomes a precedent for a second;that second for a third; and so on, till the bulk of society is reduced to mereautomatons of misery, to have no sensibilities left but for sinning andsuffering.\"Notice again the direct connection between liberty and abundance. The Foundersbelieved a nation that gives up its liberty, automatically gives up itsprosperity; millions slide into poverty.The decline might be gradual, even unnoticeable, but it will happen. In 1776they were not quite sure why this is, they only knew it was. Today we know it'sbecause of economic calculation. The blackjack mentality stops progress.What about compromise? Suppose, for instance, theDemocracy and the Constitutionmajority says to you, \"Give us 50 percent of your money,\" and you refuse. Shouldyou relent when the majority returns and says, \"Okay, we'll be reasonable, we'llsettle for 25 percent.\" Jefferson said:\"Only lay down true principles, and adhere to them inflexibly.\"The Founders' fear of democracy is apparent in the statistics of the times.Obstacles to voting were so extensive that less than three percent of the adultpopulation were permitted to vote. 35 A person had to have light skin, aspecified amount of property, the male gender, and specific religious beliefs.Again, no one in 1776 was fighting for democracy, they were fighting forliberty, which is something entirely different. Liberty, requoting Jefferson, is\"unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by theequal rights of others.\" Democracy, says my friend Marshall Fritz, \"is twowolves and a sheep voting to decide what's for lunch.\"In Federalist Paper #48, James Madison wrote about democratically electedlawmakers:\"It will be no alleviation that these powers will be exercised by a plurality ofhands, and not by a single one. One hundred and seventy-three despots wouldsurely be as oppressive as one.\"So why are we led to believe the Founders wanted America to be democratic?35 American Academic Encyclopedia, 1991, on Prodigy computerized data retrievalservice.126 Whatever Happened to Justice?They did include some minor elements of democracy in their new government. Threepercent could vote. My guess is that this was a novelty in the world then—itstill is in places—and voting is simple to understand. Common law is complex.Apparently, writers focused on the novelty, and jumped to the conclusion thatthis was the cause of America's wonderful liberty and abundance.We should also note that a huge portion of the people were against creation ofthe Constitution and federal government altogether. Called anti-federalists,they were afraid the government would grow so large and voracious thateventually it would, in Patrick Henry's words, \"oppress and ruin them.\" Asleader of the anti-federalists, Henry said he \"smelled a rat in Philadelphia.\"Chris, in my next letter we'll get deeper into the Constitution. Until then,remember the early Americans wanted liberty, not democracy. The Founders wereafraid of democracy, and to protect liberty they created the Constitution as away to weaken democracy.Uncle EricThe Constitution: Highest Law of the Land?12723The Constitution: Highest Law of the Land?Dear Chris,Here's a mystery. Article Six of the Constitution says:\"This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made inpursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under theauthority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and thejudges in every state shall be bound thereby.\"Supreme law of the land? This is a direct contradiction to John Quincy Adams'remark I mentioned in an earlier letter:\"Our political way of life is by the laws of nature, of nature's God, and ofcourse presupposes the existence of God, the moral ruler of the universe, and arule of right and wrong, of just and unjust, binding upon man, preceding allinstitutions of human society and of government.\" [Emphasis added]Whatever Happened to Justice?How can this be? Either Natural Law is the highest law or the Constitution is,it can't be both. As the Bible says, \"No man can serve two masters.\"We are not mind readers and cannot know exactly what the Founders were thinkingwhen they wrote Article Six. But if we look at the conditions and beliefs of thetimes, we can make a good guess.They knew the state democracies were degenerating into mob rule. They saw theConstitution as a control, a way to tame the state lawmakers. Many saw theConstitution as an emergency measure. They probably meant that it would be thehighest human law.This is supported by law professor Bruno Leoni in freedom and the law. Leonipoints out that in the early 1800's legislation was seen mostly as only arewrite of case law. The objective of statutes and constitutions alike was onlyto summarize and clarify common law, not overturn it. 36Also, we have the simple fact that the Founders weren't perfect. Maybe theybecame sloppy in their wording. In those days the existence of a Higher Law wastaken for granted. Everyone knew about it, their ministers taught it to them.The Founders probably felt no need to phrase Article Six as carefully as we nowknow they should have. Certainly no one dreamed that the whole world wouldsomeday return to the arbitrary legal system of the stone age.But maybe one man did. In a speech against the Constitution on June 14,1788,Patrick Henry warned, \"When our government was first instituted in Virginia, wedeclared the common law of England to be in force. That system of law which hasbeen admired and has protected us and our ances-36 p. 10.The Constitution: Highest Law of the Land?tors is excluded [by the Constitution]. ... By this Constitution some of thebest barriers of human rights are thrown away.... That paper ought to havedeclared the common law in force.\"Henry and his fellow anti-federalists were overruled and the Constitution wasenacted without a clear protection for common law. If Madison and the otherfederalists were here today I'm sure they'd be very sorry. They'd be doing allthey could to correct their mistake.Chris, in my next letter we'll talk more about the Constitution. Before we goon, I suggest you get a copy and read it. Don't read an interpretation, read areprint of the original.Uncle Eric\"But where, say some, is the king of America? I'll tell you friend, He reignsabove, and does not make havoc of mankind like the royal brute of Britain. Yet,that we may not appear to be defective even in earthly honors, let a day besolemnly set apart for proclaiming the charter; let it be brought forth placedon the divine law, the word of God; let a crown be placed thereon, by which theworld may know that so far as we approve of monarchy, that in America the law isking\"Thomas Paine common sense, January 1776Whatever Happened to Justice?24Competing For Privilege\"No power on earth has a right to take our property from us without ourconsent.\"John JayADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF BRITAINOctober 1774Dear Chris,Political law is not neutral, it is primarily a system for creating privileges.Much legislation is devoted to robbing Peter to subsidize Paul.Not realizing a neutral form of law can exist, people today do not work torevive common law. They spend their energies competing to control the politicallaw—competing for privilege. Everyone wants to be Paul and no one wants to bePeter.So, we no longer have a concept of justice. We have only, \"do unto others beforethey do it to you.\" Everyone is scrambling for control of the blackjack.Having no legal system designed to search for eternal principles, courts seek tofind ultimate law in the Constitution.Do we have a right to freedom of expression? Some say yes, it's implied by thephrase \"freedom of speech\" in the FirstCompeting For Privilege131Amendment. Others say no, \"freedom of speech\" means only that, speech. Allassume law stops at the Constitution, there is nothing higher, no Higher Law, nohigher principles.The Constitution was never intended to be the answer to all questions. It was,mostly, just a set of guidelines for running the government—an owner's manual.The Founders did their best to make it consistent with Natural Law.Read it, examine the language. Notice rights are not granted by theConstitution, they are only protected by it. The Second Amendment, for instance,refers to \"the right of the people\"—it assumes the right already exists, andestablishes a shield for it.Those who believe the Constitution is the source of our rights should read theNinth Amendment—it's only 21 words: \"The enumeration in the Constitution, ofcertain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained bythe people.\"Enumeration? Listing. Not granting, listing.And other rights? Where do these others come from?The Declaration of Independence tells us, \"the Creator.\" How do we learn aboutthem? Common law. Every legitimate legal principle goes back to the twooriginals taught by all religions and philosophies: Do all you have agreed todo, and do not encroach on other persons or their property.When courts try to find ultimate law in the Constitution, they are looking inthe wrong place. It's not there, and the Founders never intended to put itthere. If the Founders knew how the Constitution is being used today, they'dlaugh. Or cry.Chris, in my next letter we'll begin learning about power. The Founders weredeeply concerned, almost obsessed, aboutWhatever Happened to Justice?it, and we should be, too. Until then, remember that if you try to discoverfinal answers in the Constitution you will fail. They aren't in there, and theFounders would be amazed that anyone would think they are.picture17 [images/picture17.jpg]Quotes from Thomas Jefferson\"The basis of our government being the opinion of the people, the very firstobject should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether weshould have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government,I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.\"\"I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form oftyranny over the mind of man\"\"If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, itexpects what never was and never will be\"The Great Mystery25The Great MysteryDear Chris,In an earlier letter I told you I'd be writing some things you might findsurprising, maybe even unsettling. I suspect I've done that, but I'm notfinished. I still have much more to tell you. All your life you've lived withonly one side of this story about law, power and government, and you deserve tohear the other.In honesty, I should admit I'm uncomfortable doing this. My views on politicalpower are identical to those of America's Founders, and I tend to write aspassionately as they did. These views are so unusual in America today that theycan be regarded as unpatriotic or subversive.However, I am convinced you deserve to hear these views the way the Founderswould want you to hear them, clear and unvarnished, so I will go ahead and writethis way—their way. Just keep in mind that the country and the government arenot the same thing, and I dearly love this country.Let's continueIn the U.S. today there are two main political viewpoints, liberal andconservative. Liberals (the so-called left) believe in \"social\" freedom andeconomic control. They feel youWhatever Happened to Justice?should be able to read what you want, say what you want and swallow what youwant, but your production and trade should be tightly controlled by thegovernment. They also believe your income should be taxed to whatever extentappears necessary to help the poor; and, the U.S. should stay out of foreignwars.Conservatives (the right) are the reverse. They believe your production andtrade should be free, and taxes very low, but the government should control\"sinful\" things like pornography, drugs and gambling. They are also more willingto go to war.These are simplifications but for the purpose of these letters they will do.We have a problem with this left vs. right model. It doesn't tell us whatliberals and conservatives will really do when they get into power. It explainsonly how liberals and conservatives think, not how they behave.For example, conservatives want fewer taxes and they claim to work toward thisgoal. But each tax \"reform\" they give us seems to somehow yield a tax increase.This is a great mystery. Ronald Reagan was the most popular and powerfulfree-market president of the 20th century but taxes at the end of his reign werehigher than at the beginning. The Social Security \"reform\" of 1983 boosted taxesenormously.And, while we are examining conservative behavior, since 1945 conservatives havebeen anti-Soviet. But in the Iran-Iraq war (1980-88) they joined the Soviets inhelping Iraq.Worse, arch-conservative Ronald Reagan even helped pour U.S. money into theSoviet bloc. In 1981, at the exact time Mr. Reagan was making speeches about the\"evil empire,\" the federal register published a declaration fromThe Great Mystery135President Reagan: \"I determine that it is in the national interest for theExport-Import Bank of the United States to extend a credit in the amount of $120.7 million to the Socialist Republic of Romania.\" Romania was one of the mostruthless socialist states ever known.The mystery involves liberals, too. Like the conservatives, they often behaveopposite of what they think.Liberals claim to be anti-war, but Franklin Roosevelt, the most liberalpresident of the 20th century, did a great deal to get the U.S. into World WarEL He froze all Japanese assets, cut off the Japanese oil supply and stoppedJapanese access to iron and other vital raw materials. 37John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, two more liberal presidents, gave us theVietnam War; Harry Truman the Korean War.Again, the way they think is not the way they behave. So, if their beliefs arenot a guide to their behavior, what is?Political power. America's Founders believed it corrupts. No one can be trustedwith it.Our emphasis here is on political power, not power in general. As far as isknown, humans are not corrupted by37 This is not to imply that Japanese rulers were in any way innocent, they werebarbarians. But Roosevelt picked a fight with them deliberately. He wanted intothe war. If you have any doubts about this, first read Admiral Kimmel's Story byAdmiral Husband E. Kimmel, men And I was There by Admiral Edwin T. Layton.Layton was the intelligence officer at Pearl Harbor and Kimmel was thecommander. Kimmel was railroaded into taking the blame for what Roosevelt andhis cronies had done. In Kimmel's words, the soldiers and sailors who died atPearl Harbor had unknowingly been used as a \"lure for a Japanese attack.\"Whatever Happened to Justice?hydroelectric power, horsepower, economic power 38 or solar power, justpolitical power.Here's my favorite remark about political power: \"If once they [the people]become inattentive to the public affairs, you and I, and Congress andAssemblies, Judges and Governors, shall all become wolves.\"This was written not by some small-time hack politician but by none other thanThomas Jefferson, one of the greatest political philosophers and statesmen inhistory. Jefferson knew how political power affects a person, and he knew thatno human could be immune, not even himself. The blackjack can be seductive.In my next letter we will look closely at political power. Exactly what is it?How does it affect a person's judgment?For now, remember that the liberal vs. conservative or left vs. right politicalspectrum tells us how a person thinks, not how he will behave once he acquirespolitical power.Uncle Eric38 Economic power means wealth, and we have no evidence to indicate wealthcorrupts. If it did, virtually every American would be corrupt because Americansare very wealthy compared to most of the rest of the world and to all of ourancestors. However, sometimes corrupt persons are able to acquire wealth. And,wealthy persons are sometimes seduced by the temptations of political power andpolitical privilege, which do corrupt.The Privilege And The Thrill13726The Privilege And The Thrill\"It will not be denied that power is of an encroaching nature\"James Madison Federalist Paper #48Dear Chris,So, what is political power?Political power is the privilege of using force on persons who have not harmedanyone.We all have the right to use force in self-defense, but political power is theuse of force against the peaceful. The most common example is taxes. Whenofficials collect taxes from John Q. Citizen they are saying, \"Buy everything weare selling or men with guns will haul you away to prison.\"John Q. Citizen hasn't done anything to harm anyone, but he is being threatenedwith force. Government is the only institution permitted to do this. No church,charity, business or other private organization can force John to purchase itsgoods or services, or force him to obey its commands—he can always walk away.In one way or another, most of the government's laws are backed by force—by theblackjack.A political power seeker is a person who wants the privilege of using guns,chains and prisons to make you do as he thinks you should. He may not admit it,he may not evenWhatever Happened to Justice?picture18 [images/picture18.jpg]fully understand it, but, the bottom line is, a political power seeker desiresthe privilege of using force to get what he wants—although he probably does havegood intentions. Founder John Adams referred to \"cruel power,\" and his colleagueJohn Dickinson to \"brutal power.\"It's evil. One of the age-old problems with political power is that a person whowill accept it cannot betrusted with it. \"The glory of great men shouldIn his First Inaumi- always be measured by the means\"Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government of himself.Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others?\"Political power is not a skill or a talent. It is not the ability to manipulateobjects or create wealth. It is not the capacity to build a better world. It isforce used on human beings. It is something done to someone.Usually the force is carefully disguised, but it's there in the backgroundwaiting to be used if you do not obey—the mailed fist in the velvet glove.Chris, at this point I want to caution you to use every effort to think withyour mind and not your heart. If you are uncomfortable with this letter, itmight be because your emotional patriotism for your country is sending you aconfused message. In an earlier letter I said that America is aIn his First Inaugural Address in 1801, Jefferson nailed down the problem withhis usual razor-sharp logic:they have used to acquire it.\"La Rochefoucauld \"Quotable Quotes\"READERS DIGESTSeptember, 1991The Privilege And The Thrill139country that was founded on principle, not on geography. I suspect yourdiscomfort comes from your confusion on this point. Through the years you mayhave unconsciously absorbed the emotional message, \"my country right or wrong.\"Right now, you might be feeling like a she-bear who's ready to defend her cubfrom any possible threat. You might be ready to lash out at anyone or anythingthat seems to threaten your beloved America. Yes, I am critical of politics. Butremember, politics is not America. The America I love is the America ofprinciple, not of geography and not of politics. So, for our purposes here,please rein in your emotions so your reasoning mind can race ahead. Let'scontinue....Do not confuse political power with influence. Corporations and other privateorganizations can exert influence, especially monetary influence, but theycannot use guns, chains or prisons. Governments can come to your home and dragyou off to jail.Those who argue that the difference between influence and power is slight havenever been shot. Political power is violence. As dictator Mao Tse-Tung admitted,\"Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.\"For analyzing investment and economic trends, I've found some of the bestinsights about political power in the book I mentioned in a previous letter, theideological origins of the American revolution by historian Bernard Bailyn. Theleaders of the American Revolution did more scholarly work on the nature ofpower than anyone before or since, and Bailyn gives a good summary of this work.Most revealing is Samuel Adams' remark about the \"lust of power,\" which he saidis one of the \"predominant passions\" of human beings.Their study of history had led the Founders to the conclu-140 Whatever Happened to Justice?sion that the attractions of political power are not so much intellectual asphysiological. This is important. Quoting the early Americans, historian Bailyntells us power \"is known to be intoxicating,\" and \"intoxicating and liable toabuse.\" It \"converts a good man in private life to a tyrant in office.\" Powercauses \"wantonness.\"None of the Founders' beliefs about political power would come as a surprise toone who has worked in the offices of congressmen or other top officials. Theextent of the lying, back-stabbing, womanizing, drunkenness and generaldebauchery at the higher levels of governments is extraordinary and has beensince the days of the Roman orgies. In 1770, William Pitt, a politician withlong experience at the top levels of government, observed that power \"is apt tocorrupt the minds of those who possess it.\"You haven't studied these ideas in your history, civics or government classes.But, Chris, you have a good mind. I'm giving you the other side of the story soyou can use that mind to draw your own conclusions.My own theory is that political power has an addictive, drug-like effect onhumans because of our biological ancestry. Visit a history museum and you willsee skeletons of huge animals that are extinct now but roamed the earth only afew thousand years ago. The mammoths and sabre-toothed tigers are awesome. 39Surviving in that world, armed only with spears and clubs, must have been amighty challenge. Our ancestors had to have39 These animals should not be confused with dinosaurs which scientists estimatebeing millions of years old. Mammoths and sabre-toothed tigers were recent,perhaps as little as 5000 years old. In 1799, arctic explorers found completemammoths frozen in ice in Siberia. The meat was still fresh enough to be used asfood for sled dogs.The Privilege And The Thrill141some kind of edge, some kind of biochemical booster that enabled a 150-pound manto attack and kill his 2000-pound adversaries.I believe it is this booster that is triggered when political power is used. Apolitician feels the \"rush\" that our primitive ancestors felt when they went upagainst the mammoth. He gets charged up, and eventually becomes addicted to thishigh.When a child ties a tin can to a dog's tail, is this an early manifestation ofpolitical power?When a school bully intimidates a classmate, is this political power?When a street gang dominates its turf, is this political power?And, when a majority votes to tax a minority, is this political power?In his 1776 pamphlet common sense, Thomas Paine referred to the \"thirst forarbitrary power.\" At the end of this letter, I'll include some additionalthoughts about political power for you to think about—written by individuals asdiverse as Plato, Hitler and Emerson.Based on my own study and observation it seems that once a power seeker has beeninto his addiction for a few months he begins to lose his moral sense. Hebecomes not immoral but amoral, he'll say or do anything necessary to feel therush. He's a junkie.Most interesting is the similarity of the rush produced by political power tothat produced by cocaine. Medical reports describe the cocaine rush as an\"increase of heart and breathing rates\" accompanied by a feeling of\"stimulation, exhilaration\" and \"limitless power.\" 40*°The Information Please Almanac, p. 102Whatever Happened to Justice?One of the latest theories about drug addiction suggests that drugs producepleasant feelings because they are artificial substitutes for body chemicalsthat do this naturally.Could cocaine be an artificial substitute for body chemicals activated bypolitical power?As I said, most of the best research on political power was done two centuriesago by America's Founders, long before the science of biochemistry existed. Iwonder what we'd learn today using modern scientific techniques.A small amount of work along these lines has been done. The book psychopoliticalanalysis edited by Elizabeth Wirth Marvick is a collection of the research doneby psychologist Nathan Leites.Much of Leites' attention is focused on the \"collapse of ethical feelings\"experienced by power seekers. While investigating Russian politics, Leites cameacross interesting comments in Russian literature: \"There are some people whohave an urge to do the dirty even on their closest friends and very oftenwithout any good reason for it.\" And, \"Our historical pastime is the directsatisfaction of inflicting pain.\" One Russian writer said, \"It is sometimes verypleasant to smash things.\"Chris, in the next letter we'll continue learning about power. Remember thatpolitical power is the privilege of using force—the blackjack—on persons whohave not harmed anyone. This is what sets government apart from all charities,businesses and other institutions.Uncle EricPeace Officer or Police Officer?Why is it that we all like peace officers but many of us are afraid of policeofficers and all are terrified of a police state?What's the difference between a peace officer and a police officer?Look in a dictionary. The word police comes from the same Latin root aspolitics. A police officer enforces the laws of the state.A peace officer keeps the peace. He enforces the two fundamental laws that makecivilization possible. He fights encroachment and fraud. He protects us.A police officer does whatever politicians tell him, even if this means breakingthe peace and encroaching on others.In short, countries that are free have peace officers, and countries that areunfree have police officers.picture19 [images/picture19.jpg]Whatever Happened to Justice?Thoughts About Political Power\"Power is pleasure. William Hazlitt, 1826\"The pleasure of governing must certainly be exquisite, if we may judge from thevast numbers who are eager to be concerned with it.\"Voltaire, 1764\"Our power placed us above the rest.\"Winston Churchill, 1943\"The wise become as the unwise in the enchanted chambers of power.\"Walter Savage Landor, 1853\"Power, like a desolating pestilence, pollutes whatever it touches.\"Percy Bysshe Shelley, 1813\"You shall have joy, or you shall have power, said God, you shall not haveboth.\"Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1842\"There is a possible Nero in the gentlest human creature that walks.\"Thomas Bailey Aldrich, 1903\"Our sense of power is more vivid when we break a man's spirit than when we winhis heart.\"Eric Hoffer, 1954\"Power-worship blurs political judgment because it leads, almost unavoidably, tothe belief that present trends will continue.

Having power tends to corrupt us.\"Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan \"Real Patriots Ask Questions\" parade magazine,September 8, 1991Whatever Happened to Justice?27The Fun Is In The PlayingDear Chris,In this letter I'll continue giving you the other side of the story about law,power and government.Social activists observe our chronic unemployment and poverty, and complainabout the \"abuse of power\" they feel is the cause. They miss the point. Powercannot be abused, power is abuse. These hardships are its natural offspring.In the federalist papers, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton were very clearabout their belief that political power corrupts large groups and majorities aseasily as it corrupts individuals. Madison wrote that \"the majority,\" having \"apassion or interest, must be rendered...unable to concert and carry into effectschemes of oppression.\"As mentioned in an earlier letter, history is rife with examples where themajority was corrupted by its power. The French Reign of Terror, the Salem witchtrials, Nazi Germany, the Inquisition, slavery, Chairman Mao's CulturalRevolution.In a 1775 letter to her husband John, Abigail Adamswrote:The Fun Is In The Playing147\"I am more and more convinced that man is a dangerous creature and that power,whether vested in many or a few, is ever grasping, and, like the grave, cries'Give, give.' \"Part of the problem is that the total I.Q. of a group of people goes down as thegroup grows larger. But more important is the sheer thrill of exerting power, ofdomination, of conquest. The biochemical high. A mob demanding a new law or anew war is feeling the same rush as a band of cavemen spearing the mammoth.I'm reminded of the cartoon in which a club-wielding member of a lynch mob asksa companion, \"This guy we're going after, what did he do?\"The only solution is the one America's Founders tried to implement: (1) Have aslittle government as possible so that whoever gets control of it will not beable to do much damage and (2) for production of essential goods and servicesuse private organizations which cannot back their decisions with force.This is what the 1787 Constitutional Convention and 1790 Bill of Rights were allabout. The Founders were trying to keep government small and weak so thatpersons with good intentions would not be able to get control and send us downthe road to hell. They were trying to nail the blackjack to the floor.But for our discussion in this letter, the most important point is thatpolitical power is like alcohol or any other drug. It causes a person to behavein ways that are predictable.If someone tells you they have a spouse who is an alcoholic, you instantly havea rather clear picture of their home life and job performance. Alcohol corruptshumans in ways that are predictable. The same for PCP or heroin. Each drug148 Whatever Happened to Justice?produces a characteristic set of behaviors. And, so does political power.This is why anti-tax conservatives bring us higher taxes and anti-war liberalsget us into wars. They are controlled not by their beliefs but by theiraddictions.The most prominent characteristic they share with other addicts isdeceitfulness, they can't be trusted. They say what they must to get what theywant.As for their interest in war, the best analogy I've been able to come up with ischess. Being a chess player, you know that most of the fun is in the playing notthe winning. You will play even when you know you are sure to lose because thesatisfaction comes from the game itself. Victory is secondary.Power seekers enact laws, collect taxes and get us into wars for the samereason. The thrill of power comes from the use of the power; the end resultisn't all that important to them. They will get us into a war even if they knowwe will lose, because playing and losing is preferable to not playing at all.How else explain the 1983 Lebanon debacle? To this day, we still don't know whythe Marines were sent in, why they were placed in such a dangerous area or whythey were misinformed about their neutrality. All we know is that the U.S.entered the war in Lebanon and lost—just like Vietnam.Playing and losing is better than not playing at all. Neither Jefferson norMadison would have been surprised about Lebanon or Vietnam. They'd be surprisedonly that we were surprised.John Adams warned that groups of politicians can be subject to \"fits of humor,starts of passion, flights of enthusiasm, partialities, or prejudice, andconsequently productive of hasty results and absurd judgments.\" Political powercorrupts the mind. Humans are not made to be gods, they can't handle it.The Fun Is In The Playing149Psychologist Leites writes that a politician often feels that \"I may act withoutany regard for the predictability of the outcome or for the success of thecollective operation in which I participate.\"This is why I want to emphasize that I don't believe politicians can help it.They are addicts. In the intellectual sense, they don't like insane laws, taxesor wars any more than you or I do, but they get into these because it's the onlyway to feel the thrill. Heroin addicts don't like needles but they use them.Politicians tell themselves they are doing it for us, but they are really doingit to us. This is the source of their rush. They won't admit it, not even tothemselves, but doing things to people is what gives them pleasure. And, I'm notsure they should be blamed. In our culture today political power is regarded asgood. We are all taught that everyone should have it and use it.Political power seekers have three priorities:Top priority: To keep the power they have.Second priority: To use it on someone—to feel the thrill of spearing themammoth.Third priority: To get more power.These goals might sound similar to those of corporate presidents or other headsof private organizations. The difference is that heads of private organizationscannot use guns, chains and prisons on us.Notice that these priorities have nothing to do with money.150 Whatever Happened to Justice?Politicians are a different breed than the rest of us, they are not seekers ofprofit. For most of them, money is not a reward, it is only a tool that issometimes useful in gaining and using power. I remember watching one Californiapolitician spend more than a million dollars of his own money to gain an officethat paid only a few thousand per year.\"The only prize much cared for by the powerful is power.\"Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., 1913When an important issue arises and you are trying to discover how the lawmakerswill respond to it, place yourself in their shoes. Ask yourself, \"If I were theyand had their priorities, what would I do?\" My personal estimate is that youwill predict correctly at least 80 percent of the time.Granted, this system isn't infallible but it works better than any other I knowof.

Someone might read these letters and jump to the conclusionthat I believe a vast conspiracy is behind it all. I don't. I do believeconspiracies exist and the conspirators are trying to steer events in directionsfavorable to them. But these conspiracies are not the root of the problem. Theroot is political power. Eliminate all the conspirators without eliminatingthese gigantic governments they are trying to control and two weeks later we'djust have a whole new crop of conspirators trying to gain control of the govern-The Fun Is In The Playing151ments. They'd have little choice. No wealthy person can afford to be withoutconnections in the government when the government has the power to takeeverything he has.In short, conspiracies exist and they bear watching, but they are symptoms, notcauses. The cause is political power. It corrupts.Chris, what do you think so far? The hope of the future rests with people who,like the American Founders, recognize that power is brutality, and are suspectof crowds. But these people are, unfortunately, rare. Few have heard the otherside of the story, which is why I write these letters. We must spread the word.Uncle Eric Abigail AdamsPainting by Gilbert Stuart Reproduced from the dictionary of American portraits,published by Dover Publications, Inc., in 1967.picture20 [images/picture20.jpg]\"1 am more and more convinced that man is a dangerous creature and that power,whether vested in many or a few, is ever grasping, and, like the grave, cries'Give, give.' \" — Abigail AdamsWhatever Happened to Justice?28The Lessons of Simon BolivarDear Chris,We can learn important lessons by examining the exploits of Simon Bolivar in ourneighboring countries to the south. These countries all havedemocracy—sometimes.Born in 1783, Bolivar was well-educated. He was impressed by the AmericanRevolution and the new philosophy of freedom that was spreading around theworld.A great admirer of the American Founders, Bolivar launched a revolution in LatinAmerica to copy them, to free South America from Spain. It was one of the mostsuccessful revolutions in history. Bolivar freed not one country but six:Venezuela, Columbia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Bolivia (which was named afterhim).But after the revolution Bolivar was faced with the same problem every otherrevolutionary faces. Now that the old political system was gone, what could hecreate to replace it?There are two general models of how political change unfolds, the AmericanRevolution and the French Revolution. The symbol of the American Revolution isthe Liberty Bell. The symbol of the French Revolution is the guillotine.The American Revolution was based on the principles ofThe Lessons of Simon Bolivar153the old British common law. The French Revolution was based on democracy,majority rule.The American Revolution led to the most free and prosperous nation ever known.The French Revolution led to the Reign of Terror and the Napoleonic Wars.Bolivar was faced with the same problem encountered by the people of East Europeand the Soviet Union in 1990 when the Soviet empire began disintegrating. Beingof non-British origins, they had no background in British common law.Bolivar's revolution led not to liberty but to democracy and war, the Frenchmodel. After separating from Spain, Chile went to war against Peru and Bolivia.Paraguay against Argentina, and assassinations and uprisings became the nationalsports of Latin America.In 1828, in an attempt to bring stability, Bolivar, the great champion ofliberty, became a dictator.But he failed to copy the American Founders' success. In the latin nationsnothing worked then, and nothing works today. The latin nations still ride apendulum that swings every few years from dictatorship to democracy and chaos,then back to dictatorship, and so on.Genuine liberty is not possible for them because these nations never adopted arational legal system. Their people have never known about Higher Law, commonlaw, the two fundamental laws or free markets. They know only democracy,majority rule. Some have had dozens of revolutions in which the streets havebeen paved with bodies.Because they have no legal stability, these countries are unsafe for investment.Anyone who is smart enough to earn extra money is smart enough to send it out ofthe country to Switzerland or some other safe haven beyond the reach of the nextdictator.Whatever Happened to Justice?Without this money, factories and other job-creating businesses are not built.Poverty in Latin America is never ending.The latin nations are economic disaster areas eclipsed only by the Africannations, which have exactly the same problem, political law. Their legal systemsenforce majority rule or dictatorial rule, not Higher Law.I once met an American investor who had thought it was safe to get involved in abusiness venture in a newly democratic nation. He lost a fortune but didn' tunderstand why until he heard one of my speeches about common law. If you knowanyone who is headed into this same mistake, you might want to let him readthese letters.Chris, if you want to understand what is happening in your world today, studythe differences between the French Revolution and the American Revolution. TheFrench went after democracy, and the Americans went after liberty. The Frenchgot mob rule and the Reign of Terror, and the Americans got the most free andprosperous nation ever seen on earth.As you watch events unfold in other nations, remember Simon Bolivar. Historyrepeats.Uncle EricEating The Seed Corn15529Eating The Seed CornCausing Unemployment and PovertyDear Chris,Why does America, the land of opportunity, now have so much unemployment andpoverty? And, why does so much of this unemployment and poverty seem to bepermanent? One reason is a shortage of seed corn.When farmers grow crops, they do not eat or sell the whole crop. Some is keptback, saved, to be used as seed for next year's crop. This savings is calledseed corn. An abundance of food is possible only if someone is saving largequantities of seed corn.In other parts of the economy, seed corn takes the form of saving money. Thesavings are placed into stocks, bonds and other investments where they are usedto build factories, offices and other places of work. These places of work arethepicture21 [images/picture21.jpg]Whatever Happened to Justice?source of jobs and incomes. In every nation, they are the most important forcein eliminating poverty.To have an abundance of good jobs and incomes, a nation must have an abundanceof savings, an abundance of \"seed corn.\"When a government grows so large that the taxpayers become angry at the hightaxes, the government sometimes tries to delay collection of the taxes byborrowing. This borrowing diverts the flow of money away from the investmentsthat create the jobs and incomes. It causes a shortage of these investments,which means a shortage of the jobs and incomes.This is called \"crowding out.\" The government crowds businesses and employeesout of the economy, thereby creating unemployment and poverty. In other words,the government eats our seed corn.Do not fall into the trap of thinking of unemployment and poverty as statisticsor percentages. A six percent unemployment rate means millions of fine, innocentpeople suffering in uncountable ways. Stress, hardship, bankruptcy, alcoholism,drug abuse, divorce, juvenile delinquency — the list of agonies goes on and on.Desperation.A nation that has a shortage of seed corn has an appointment with disaster.Uncle EricEating The Seed Corn157To pay for its spending the federal government is now borrowing money at therate of $1.4 million every two minutes.picture22 [images/picture22.jpg]0 1 1 1 r~1945 1960 1975 1990\"Even if federal deficits could be reduced to a 'mere' $ 100 billion annually,the compounding of national debt and interest payments by the early twenty-firstcentury will still cause quite unprecedented totals of money to be diverted inthat direction.

Furthermore, you will know things that some people don't want you toknow. This side of the story may make you uncomfortable, because it's sodifferent from anything you've heard before. Keep in mind that America is awonderful country, but the country and the government are not the same thing. AsI've been saying, you've got a good mind, and you are old enough now to hear theother side.Jefferson believed it imperative that individuals be correctly informed. Hesaid:\"I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the peoplethemselves; and if weOrigin of Government159think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesomediscretion, the remedy is not to take it from them but to inform theirdiscretion.\"When living in a government-controlled economy as we do today, you will bebetter able to manage your career and investments if you understand the natureand behavior of government. Obvious, right? If you try to make decisions basedon fictions you'll be running much risk.So, what is the real nature and behavior of government? Where did governmentcome from?Any child knows the answers, right? It's easy. The institution of government wasinvented long, long ago to help us. People needed certain essential services,especially law enforcement, so they got together, chose someone to be theirgovernment, and voluntarily agreed to pay taxes for the services the governmentwould provide.This is the official story we are all taught. It sounds good except for twosmall problems. First, no historian has ever been able to find an example ofthis happening. In a theory of the origin of the state, anthropologist Robert L.Car-neiro writes, \"We now know that no such compact was ever subscribed to byhuman groups.\" 41 Sociologist Franz Oppen-heimer, writing in the state, is moreblunt. He calls this explanation \"a fairy tale,\" 42 and is distressed that it is\"prevalent in university teaching.\" 4341 A Theory of the Origin of the State by Robert L. Carneiro, Institute forHumane Studies, George Mason University, VA, p. 4.A2 The State by Franz Oppenheimer, Viking Press, Free Life Editions, New York,1944, p. 5.Whatever Happened to Justice?The second problem with the official story is, as economist Murray Rothbardnotes in for a new liberty, \"By far the overwhelming portion of all enslavementand murder in the history of the world have come from the hands of government.\"This is an institution designed to help us?The official explanation for the origin of government is quite wrong anddangerously misleading. It creates a false sense of security, and none ofAmerica's Founders would want us to believe it. I will give you a few of theirremarks shortly.The official explanation actually applies more to the origin of common law thanto government.Carneiro and Oppenheimer explain, in a much more scholarly fashion than I willhere, the real reason government was invented.Historians and anthropologists have now located many examples of peacefulcommunities that had gangs of barbarians living nearby. Imagine one of our moreviolent motorcycle gangs riding into town on horses instead of motorcycles andyou will have the picture.These barbarians were lazy and had little interest in work. Every few weeks theywould ride into town, steal food, clothing and whatever else they could carry,then ride back out. They would live off this stolen loot until it was gone, thenride back in and raid the town again.This would go on for many years until—One night, as the barbarians were sitting around their campfire, planning theirnext attack, one complained, \"You know, all this riding in and out of townfighting with people is beginning to feel like work. It isn't fun anymore,there's got to be a better way.\"Origin of Government161Another lamented, \"You're right, in the last raid I lost an ear and two morefingers. I'm running out of parts.\"This sorrowful discussion would continue until someone exclaimed, \"I've got it!Let's just ride into town and stay! We'll put up a building in the middle oftown and call it City Hall or State Capitol or some such thing, and we'll use itas a hangout. We'll take baths and shave, and dress up in fine clothes likerespectable businessmen. Then we'll levy something we'll call a tax.\"We '11 tell the people—we'll call them taxpayers—that as long as they pay thistax regularly, exactly as we tell them, with the right forms and everything, wewon't punish them. We'll start the tax low so that they won't feel it's worthfighting over, and each year we'll raise it a bit until we're taking a sizablepart of their incomes.\"Another barbarian suggested, \"Yes, and we could use some of the tax money toprovide a few services, maybe streets, schools and courts, so that the peoplewill feel they're getting something for their money.\"And another added the final touches. \"There are other gangs in this area. Whenthey see how docile our taxpayers have become, they'll try to ride in and takeover. They'll be shearing our sheep. We'll need to provide police and an army,to protect what's ours. The taxpayers will love it—they'll think we're doing itfor them.\"Carneiro says this was the essential process for the invention of governments in\"Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, China, Japan, Greece, Rome, northern Europe, centralAfrica, Polynesia, Middle America, Peru, and Columbia, to name only the mostprominent examples.\" 44 Oppenheimer adds Britain, France, Arabia, Italy,Germany, Spain, Mexico and manyIbid. p. 6.Whatever Happened to Justice?others. 45 All governments today have evolved from these origins.In other words, governments do not collect taxes to provide services, theyprovide services as an excuse to collect taxes. A tax is a substitute for araid.You might remember in my first letter I said the country and the government arenot the same thing. Now you know why. The government is a group of politiciansand bureaucrats who are gradually conquering the country.Have you ever heard this side of the story before? It is rather startling, isn'tit? And it explains why governments have been wrecking economies, creatingpoverty, and murdering and enslaving people for thousands of years. It's whatthey were invented to do. It's the nature of the beast.It's also why America's Founders were convinced political power corrupts. JohnAdams said, \"Fear is the foundation of most governments,\" and Thomas Paineasked, \"From such beginnings of governments, what could be expected, but acontinual system of war and extortion?\"Carneiro observes: \"A close examination of history indicates that only acoercive theory can account for the rise of the state.\" 46Oppenheimer said: \"Everywhere, we find some warlike tribe of wild men breakingthrough the boundaries of some less warlike people, settling down as nobilityand founding its State.\" 47Remember the barbarians who took over Europe after the Roman Empire fell? Thefeudal kingdoms?45 Ibid. p. 8. 46 Ibid. p. 6. 47 Ibid. p. 8.Origin of Government163When you visit Europe and England you will see a castle every few miles.Probably the most famous are the castles on the Rhine.The Romans had owned plantations called latifundia. A gang of barbarians wouldoverrun a latifundium, force the workers into a kind of slavery called serfdom,and make these serfs build them a fort called a castle. The gang would set uphousekeeping in the castle and live off the taxes they collected from the serfs.This is royalty. We are led to believe kings and queens are like movie stars,glamorous and wealthy. Children are told stories in which the young heroinedreams of becoming a princess and marrying a handsome young prince.Marrying a handsome young prince meant marrying a handsome young gangster, and,in some cases, a handsome young mass murderer.Granted, royalty means wealth, but the wealth came through conquest. It wasstolen, not earned. A castle was not so much a romantic palace as a plushheadquarters of a concentration camp. When you visit one, ask to see not justthe stately halls and bedrooms, but the dungeons and torture chambers, too.Royalty means bullying and tyranny. Far from being \"highness,\" these people werethe lowest, they were predators. Today's royalty are descended from them. Inmany cases, their enormous wealth is loot their ancestors stole. Their prestigeis from the time when they had their victims convinced kings had a specialdivine right to prey on others.It's difficult for us today to imagine how brutal and corrupt royalty was. InEurope their political law said a young bride could not sleep with her groomuntil she first allowed herself to be raped by the king.Whatever Happened to Justice?America's Founders hated royalty. This is not an exaggeration. They feltcontempt, revulsion.When Jefferson was U.S. minister to France, he was amazed at the degeneracy ofthe royalty. He wrote that Gustavus HI of Sweden and Joseph II of Austria werecrazy; Charles IV of Spain and Ferdinand IV of Naples were fools; Maria queen ofPortugal was an idiot, and Frederick William II of Prussia was \"a mere hog inbody as well as mind.\" He referred to all royalty as \"animals\" who had \"becomewithout mind.\" 48Is this someone you'd want your daughter to marry?This is not a small point. These fantasies about handsome princes and beautifulprincesses are dangerous, they whitewash the truth. They give children theimpression political power is wonderful stuff.A castle was a hangout for silk-clad gangsters who were stealing from helplessworkers. The king was the \"lord\" who had control of the blackjack; he claimed aspecial \"divine right\" to use force on the innocent.picture23 [images/picture23.jpg]Castles were not beautiful palaces for heroic princes and princesses. Most wereheadquarters for concentration camps. These camps, called feudal kingdoms, wereestablished by conquering barbarians who had enslaved the local people. Fairytales about castles and royalty give impressionable young minds the idea thatpolitical power is good.48 Letter to J. Langdon, 1810.Origin of Government165The British government evolved from these feudal origins, and the U.S.government from the British government.The world's early governments evolved into those we have today, and all haveretained their essential natures. To get what they want they use force. Theforce is usually hidden but it's there and you will feel it if you resist.I believe a major reason America and the world have gotten into so much troubleduring the 20th century is that we have forgotten that, fundamentally,governments are predators. Attempts to make them do good are attempts to makethe leopard change his spots. Maybe it can be done, but 6000 years of historyare not encouraging.My experience has been that deep in their hearts most people sense there issomething inherently wrong with government. Is there any country where the wordpolitics is not pronounced with a sneer? But while they were still children,they were taught that political power is brilliant, beautiful, noble anddesirable. Cinderella. Prince Valiant.But government is good, isn't it? Bureaucracies exist to solve problems for us,don't they?In a time for action, former U.S. Treasury Secretary William Simon writes:\"The bureaucrat's first objective, of course, is preservation of hisjob—provided by the big-government system, at taxpayer's expense.... Whetherreal-world problems get solved or not is of secondary importance. It doesn'ttake much cynicism, in fact, to see that the bureaucrats have a vested interestin not having problems solved. If the problems did not exist (or had not beeninvented), there would be no reason for the bureaucrat to have a job.\"Whatever Happened to Justice?Notice Simon's remark, \"had not been invented.\" Re-from which a tyrant springs; when he unemployment andgeographer John Melish dated January 13,1813. In this letter Jefferson made aninteresting statement: \"An honest man can feel no pleasure in the exercise ofpower over his fellow citizens.\"Think about this. An honest man will not like political power. What does thistell us about the inherent nature of government?You've probably read statements by politicians complaining that no matter howhard they try to do good, it never comes out the way they plan. Sometimes theyeven feel compelled to do what they know isn't right.They probably do not realize it, but this is because they are part of aninstitution that is designed to use force—to do damage. Good intentions matterlittle.The most difficult lesson every social activist eventually learns is that if youwait for the government to solve your problems you'll wait for a very long time.Chris, as I mentioned in an earlier letter, most people today think law andgovernment are the same thing. The reason is that in every society I know of,the first industry the government nationalizes 50 is the justice industry. Lawcontains the49 See Whatever Happened to Penny Candy? by Richard J.

What do you think of it?Before I close this letter, let me emphasize that I am not accusing governmentbureaucrats of intentionally doing anything wrong. They haven't heard the otherside of the story either — as children, they heard the same fairy tales you andI did—and I'm sure most believe the benefits of what they do are greater thanthe costs. Many costs are hidden.Until next time, remember that law and government are two very differentinstitutions. Indeed, they are op-posites. Governments and their legislation arethe natural enemies of real law. They were invented for the purpose ofen-croachment.

WhenI was young I'd occasionally hear a snide remark or wisecrack about lawyers. Nowit's outright ridicule, sometimes hatred.This should not be surprising. How can lawyers be respected when the law itselfis corrupt?The public knows something is wrong, and directs their frustrations at thelawyers. I do not think they are aware of how many lawyers have been trying todraw attention to the corruption of the law.In my second letter I mentioned Judge Clarence Thomas' belief in Natural Law,and his speech referring to John Quincy Adams. Judge Thomas is not alone.Whatever Happened to Justice?Charles Meachling, Jr. is an international lawyer, former Cambridge lawprofessor and U.S. State Department official. In the brookings review he wrote:\"In the U.S. the sanctimonious maxim that 'Ignorance of the law is no excuse'puts every citizen at risk. That may have been a sound rule in simpler times,when the catalog of punishable offenses was limited to traditional offenses likemurder, robbery, rape and larceny, but it becomes a sinister joke when appliedto the five-foot shelf of the U.S. criminal code and the even more voluminousstatutes of individual states.\"Moreover, in the U.S. a citizen cannot rely on the plain meaning of a statute,or what passes for it. He must retain a lawyer to parse its legislative historyand judicial evolution. So many forms of social and economic activity have nowbeen criminalized that the discretionary power of federal and state authoritiesto pick and choose targets for prosecution has made enforcement utterlyarbitrary.\"In the case of the tax codes, not one citizen in ten million can tell whetherhe has committed a trivial error or subjected himself to the risk of a felonyconviction. In addition, by a grotesque inversion of legal principle, the burdenis on the taxpayer to prove his innocence.\" 52Note Meachling's statement that enforcement now is \"utterly arbitrary.\" In thewall street journal, Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Alex Kozinski writes that\"Over the past half-century the idea that the law consists of objective rules52 Reprinted in the Sacramento Bee Forum, July 21, 1991.Are Lawyers and Judges Corrupt?171has been supplanted\" by what he calls \"subjectification.\"In other words, judge Kozinski is angry that laws now are deliberately madeunclear. The purpose is to widen the power of law enforcers to catch whomeverthey suspect of wrongdoing. This also makes it impossible for you and me to knowif we are breaking the law. Judge Kozinski writes,\"Legislators often find it convenient to be vague and let the courts figure itout.

Their data about theorigin of government was less complete; and, the science of economics was brandnew then. The Founders suspected humans are smart enough to get essentialservices without government but they didn't have proof.But the most important reason they set up a government is simply that they hadno choice. Mo^t people believed government was necessary. If the Founders didn'tset one up, someone else would.The best solution was to create a government, then cripple it, and this is whatthe Founders tried to do. Read the federalist papers of Madison, Hamilton andJay. They deliberately made the government slow and stupid. TheySo Why Do We Have A Government?173wanted to be governed by a turtle not a lion. But ever since, the turtle hasbeen working hard to turn itself into a lion.In Federalist Paper #48 Madison said the Founders hoped to prevent \"thetyrannical concentration of all the powers of government in the same hands.\" TheFounders divided the power among the various branches so that \"the encroachingspirit of power\" of each branch would be directed at the other branches and awayfrom the people. In Federalist #51 he said \"Ambition must be made to counteractambition.\"This is the main purpose of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. The checks andbalances were to keep the government from being efficient, so that no matter whogot control they would be unable to do much damage. Infighting would keep thegovernment weak.President Harry Truman knew this. He once explained, \"Whenever you have anefficient government you have a dictatorship.\" Thomas Jefferson said, \"I am nota friend to a very energetic government. It is always oppressive.\"Why is our government so often dimwitted, slow and wasteful? Because theFounders planned it that way, thank heavens.They felt government is, in Thomas Paine' words, a \"necessary evil,\" withemphasis on the evil. In his first inaugural address in 1801, Jefferson said:\"Still one thing more, fellow citizens—a wise and frugal government, which shallrestrain men from injuring one another, which shall leave them otherwise free toregulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take fromthe mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the sum of good government.\"174 Whatever Happened to Justice?Federal Civilian EmployeesmillionsThis attempt to keep the government small and weak was mostly successful formore than 100 years. In 1821 the Federal government had only 6,914 civilianemployees; sixty years later it still had only 100,020. Not until the 20thcentury did the government's growth become explosive, now exceeding 3,000,000.Since 1821, the population of the U.S. has increased 25 fold while the federalgovernment has increased 430 fold. Now you know why your parents are alwayscomplaining about taxes. The turtle has become the lion, and he's hungry.Interestingly, in 1824, when the Federal government had about 8,500 civilianemployees, Jefferson complained, \"I think we have more machinery of governmentthan is necessary, too many parasites living on the labor of theindustries.\" I wonder whatxhe'd say if he could see us now.Do we need a government at all today?

If no one hasever found a way to provide an essential service without the use of force oninnocent persons, then government should do it.Of course, we now understand enough about economics to know how to geteverything done without the use of force on innocent persons.Law enforcement, schools, help for the poor, fire protection, military defense,hospitals, you name it, it's all been worked out, tried and proven by someonesomewhere, by private means. In my next letters I'll give a few examples.Organizations have been set up to teach how to do all this.

Mover several centuries. But we must begin now working in this direction or thelion will continue to grow. Soon we will be completely devoured.Before I end this letter I'll tip my hand a bit and tell you more about my ownpersonal beliefs.I have faith that all problems can be solved without the use of force on personswho have not harmed someone. I believe this because I believe God did not createa world in which humans must use force on each other.I believe the world is made so that we always have a choice. The choice mightnot be clear, but that's why we have been given intelligence, to find the betterway.Consider the alternative. If ignorance excuses the use of force, then the moredimwitted I am the more force I am allowed to use.Before the slaves were freed in 1863, no one knew how cotton could be harvestedwithout them. But slavery was wrong and it was abolished, and today cotton isharvested more efficiently than it ever was by slaves. Not only are the blacksbetter off but the plantation owners are, too. That's how the world is made.Liberty and free markets not only work, they work better.Chris, in the following letters I'll give examples of problems that remainunsolved because common law has been destroyed. Until then remember that theFounders were afraid of government and were trying, more than anything else, toset up a government that would do as little harm as possible.Uncle Eric\"Nothing in fine print is ever good news.\"Andy Rooney on \"60 Minutes,\" CBSWe Cannot Find the Answers\"Man cannot make principles, he can only discover them.\"Thomas PaineCommon law was our way of discovering legal principles. Now it is gone, but ourhigh-tech civilization continues moving forward without its guidance. We areleft without a way to answer legal questions about:AbortionAcceptable levels of risk Animal rights Artificial intelligence Assisted suicideChild theory EuthanasiaFathers' rights to children born out of wedlockGenetic engineeringIrredentismOwnership of ancient cemeteries & archaeological sitesOwnership of extraterrestrial mineralsOwnership of orbitsOwnership of scenic viewsSexuality of mental incompetentsSpace junkSurrogate motherhood Thermal pollution Transmission of sexual diseasesWhatever Happened to Justice?33Unsolved Problem: RiskDear Chris,We are approaching the end of my series of letters about law. In this and thenext few I'll give examples of problems that remain unsolved—and that may beunsolvable—because of the absence of common law. We no longer have a rationalsystem for finding solutions, we have only majority rule.Before we go further, however, I'd like you to do a 3-step mental exercise.First, make a list of all the services government provides. Second, scratch outthe ones you believe are not necessary or that yield benefits that are not asgreat as the costs. Third, try to think of a way the remaining services could beprovided without the use of force and without any government involvement—thismeans especially without taxes.You are intelligent and I believe with no help you can figure out the answers toat least 90% of them. If you are willing to spend much time on the problem, I'llraise that to 99%.Few ever do this exercise. I'm sure this is because they've been told by so manygovernment experts that private solutions are not possible.Now let's get into some of the more serious problems wepicture26 [images/picture26.jpg]Unsolved Problem: Risk179have today because of the absence of common law.One of the worst problems today concerns the question, how much risk is toomuch? Here's an example.Suppose I have a gun and I shoot at you, but I'm a bad shot and I miss. I tryagain, and miss. And again, and again.Are you allowed to strike back or must you wait until I hit you before you areallowed to defend yourself?Centuries ago, common law courts held that you didn't need to wait. My firstshot—indeed my simple act of pointing the gun and threatening you—was enough foryou to take action. I would have raised the level of risk high enough that you'dbe allowed to react. I have encroached.But if I don't threaten you, you can't react. If I'm just holding the gun downby my side and not pointing it in a threatening manner, you can't do anything tome. The level of risk isn't high enough yet.The key point is the level of risk. In every society people are surrounded byrisks of every kind. Life involves risk, we cannot live in a perfectly safeworld.In other words, there is an ambient level of risk. An individual might get hitby a car, or caught in a tornado. He might be struck down by a serious disease,or die in a plane crash.picture27 [images/picture27.jpg]Whatever Happened to Justice?We are entitled to take action against others only when they have raised thelevel of risk beyond the ambient level.But that's all we know. The common law was gone before judges were able to comeup with a definite measure of how much risk is too much.Can an individual keep a deadly object in his home? Say a chain saw?Yes, a chain saw is okay. It could fall into the wrong hands and lead tosomeone's injury or death, but any court would say this risk is not above theambient level.Can an individual have a car? Yes, even though cars kill tens of thousands everyyear, the risk is not excessive.An electric hair dryer? Razor blades? Matches? Liquor?Yes, all are dangerous, and some have no redeeming social value at all, but theyare within acceptable limits of risk.The Consumer Product Safety Commission based in Washington D.C. has found thatbetween 1985 and 1990,125 children were killed by drowning in buckets.Between 1981 and 1991, at least 69 were strangled by drapery cords.Between 1982 and 1991, 33 children were killed by electric garage door openers.Between 1973 and 1991, 33 were killed by toy chest lids.Between 1980 and 1991, three lost their lives to the retracting footrests ofrecliner chairs.Buckets, drapery chords, garage door openers, toy chests and recliner chairs arelegal. They involve risk of injury or death, but individuals are allowed to havethem because the risks are considered within the ambient level.Can an individual have an atomic bomb?No, here the risk is too great. A car or a chain saw could kill dozens, but anatomic bomb, if it fell into the wrong hands,Unsolved Problem: Risk181could kill millions. Any court would say the atomic bomb is too risky. Thepolice or even the neighbors would be entitled to forcibly enter the person'shome and remove the bomb.But where do we draw the line between the chain saw and the atomic bomb?At rifles? Shotguns? Thompson submachine guns? Bazookas? Howitzers? Nerve gas?Where would you draw the line, and why there? I'm sure more Americans have beenaccidentally killed by drapery cords than by bazookas.Remember, a rational legal system requires you to have some justification forforcibly entering another person's home and confiscating his property. For us tobe permitted to encroach on him, he must first be guilty of encroaching on us,of raising the risk too far.But we have no way to measure how far is too far. The common law was gone beforejudges could figure it out.This is like abolishing the science of chemistry, then trying to discoverTeflon. It can't be done.Another interesting point here is that a shotgun is an extremely lethal weapon.In the hands of an untrained criminal it's far more lethal than the Thompsonsubmachine gun — the famous \"Tommy gun.\" But under political law in most areasof the U.S., the shotgun is legal and the Thompson isn't.Even among trained police and military commandos, in close-quarter situations,which is where most crime occurs, the shotgun would be the weapon of choice —not the Thompson. 54 But the Thompson looks more deadly in the movies, which isapparently why it's banned.54 The Thompson is hard to aim and only makes holes; the shotgun is easy to aimand makes craters.Whatever Happened to Justice?In speaking of risk, we must also take into account downstream effects. If wemake handguns illegal, some criminals will surely switch to sawed-off shotguns.What would you rather be hit by, a .22 caliber Saturday night special or a12-gauge shotgun?Common law was gone before it had a chance to develop tight guidelines to answerquestions about risk, and political law is far too crude to have any hope ofdoing it rationally.In banning the Thompson and the handgun but allowing the shotgun, lawmakers seemto be saying, \"If a criminal shoots someone we want him to use the deadlierweapon.\" That's political law.This kind of craziness will continue until the common law is revived and theguidelines on risk are worked out. Until then, all we have is majority rule. Wedo not know how much risk is too much.Uncle EricUnsolved Problem: Capital Punishment18334Unsolved Problem: Capital PunishmentDear Chris,Another unsolved problem concerns executions of persons found guilty of murderand other especially terrible crimes. Should capital punishment be permitted orshould the maximum sentence be life imprisonment?Should a murderer be drawn and quartered? Boiled in oil?Personally I couldn't care less what happens to a vicious person but the problemis more complex than that. The desire for revenge is understandable, but lookclosely at the organization exacting the revenge—the court.Today's courts are government agencies. Like the post office, the welfare systemand the pentagon, they are not especially well-run. They make mistakes, lots ofthem. Ask any lawyer.If we permit courts to order capital punishment, then we are permitting them toaccidentally kill an unknown number of innocent persons. Do we want that?Would you trust your life to the post office?Furthermore, capital punishment is wasteful. A dead criminal can't do anythingto help the families of his victims.Whatever Happened to Justice?An accountant might point out that the criminal's debt to the family is an assetowned by that family. It's their property. To kill the criminal is to steal thisproperty. It's a violation of the second fundamental law, do not encroach onother persons or their property.To do anything that keeps the criminal from making payments on this debt is toviolate this law.Under our present legal system, there's nothing we can do about this. Thecriminal owes his debt to \"society '' meaning the government. If he killssomeone, he has an obligation to make license plates.Common law had this problem worked out — or at least 95 percent worked out—underthe practice of restitution. But that's all gone now. Today all we have ismajority rule.If you are interested in exploring the question of capital punishment further,take a look at two excellent movies, the murder of mary phagan (1988) with JackLemmon, and twelve angry men (1957) with Henry Fonda. As you watch, think howcommon law could have dealt with these crimes.And, when you talk with someone about capital punishment, ask if they've heardthe other side of the story about law, power and government.Uncle EricUnsolved Problem: The Environment18535Unsolved Problem: The EnvironmentDear Chris,Let's look at a couple of environmental problems. First, the poisoning of theoceans. This is an extremely serious problem because the oceans are the sourceof most of our oxygen and a large portion of our food. I'll pose a question.Suppose I dump toxic waste on a farmer's land and destroy his harvest, what willhappen?The farmer will quickly have the sheriff after me.But suppose I dump this poison in mid-ocean and destroy the tuna the fishermenare trying to harvest. What happens to me then? Probably nothing. Why?The fishermen are not allowed to have property rights in the ocean. They can'tclaim an area as theirs, as farmers can on land. The farmer's property rightsare protected, and so the cleanliness of his land is protected, but the ocean isunprotected because property rights are unprotected.Under political law I have as much right to that stretch of water as anyone elsedoes because the ocean is \"public property\" meaning anyone can use it foranything they please.Whatever Happened to Justice?The same stretch of water can be used for harvesting food, swimming and dumpinggarbage.Here's another environmental problem. You've mentioned your worries about thegreat Amazon rain forest being destroyed. Each year in Brazil, twenty millionacres of forest are cleared. 55 This wonderful source of oxygen,pharmaceuticals, rare animal species and other benefits is fast being wiped outby Brazilian timber companies and others. Why?Because the Brazilian government has decided this is in the public interest.The Amazon lands are not uninhabited. Indians live there, and have forcenturies. But the Brazilian government asks, How can the property rights of afew thousand Indians be as important as the millions of voters whose jobsrequire the destruction of this property?Wherever we find an individual's property rights violated, we find the door opento environmental damage. This is why East Europe and the former Soviet Union areso badly poisoned and filthy. Under their political legal systems until 1990,all land and water were regarded as public property. Whatever belongs toeveryone belongs to no one, and no one has much incentive to protect it.People who wanted to dump garbage in a stream had as much right to do this asothers who had always lived on the stream and taken drinking water from it. Thelegal phrase \"in the public interest\" led to pollution and poisoning of thepublic.Chris, someday I hope you can travel around the world as I have. You'll see thatthe nations where the individual's property rights are best protected are thecleanest. I've seen\"Empires of the Chainsaws,\" The Economist, August 10, 1991.Unsolved Problem: The Environment187ocean beaches, as well as streams, on almost every continent; and everywhere,those that are private are cleaner than those that are public.So much toxic waste was dumped around the town of Oberrothenbach in socialistEast Germany that, unknown to the residents, homes were built of radioactiveslag. The water supply is so radioactive it will be dangerous for a thousandyears. Some 460 square miles of land will need decontamination at a cost of $5.6billion. 56All this dumping was held to be in the public interest. Officials asked, how canthe property rights of a few hundred villagers be more important than the needsof the nation?As I said in an earlier letter, when encroachment occurs, the consequences maynot be immediately apparent. But they eventually come to the surface somewhere,and they can be devastating.Few nations today have legal systems capable of providing good protection for anindividual's property rights. We have only majority rule, and the majority oftenvotes to trample all over an individual's property. They want the land and waterto be public so that they can have easy, inexpensive access to it.Public property means public pollution. I remember when Yosemite was a grand andbeautiful national park. Now it's becoming a filthy city. Yet Disneyland handlesdozens of times more people per acre than Yosemite, and it's as clean and freshas the day it was built. The owners protect their property. They guard the parkagainst vandals, and charge an admission fee that enables them each night torepair any damage done during the previous day.56 \" Atomic Waste Poisoning E. German Town,\" Dallas Morning News story inSacramento Bee, August 2, 1991, p. A4.Whatever Happened to Justice?picture28 [images/picture28.jpg]My personal estimate is that if desirable lands and waters were privateproperty, and if property rights were protected, 95 percent of the world'senvironmental problems would vanish immediately.It's a simple principle. You can dump your garbage in your own backyard butdon't let the slightest bit — not even the odor — overflow into someone else's.This applies to noise pollution, too. On your own property you can make all thenoise you want, but don't let it overflow above the ambient level onto yourneighbor's property. Or, do not encroach. This keeps things clean and quietautomatically.It's an old principle of common law. You can do as you please on your ownproperty but let nothing spill over onto anyone else's. Leave other people'sproperty alone. This keeps the world clean, quiet and healthy.Uncle Ericpicture29 [images/picture29.jpg]Unsolved Problem: Drugs18936Unsolved Problem: DrugsDear Chris,If government has any legitimate purpose, it's to fight crime. But someAmericans believe the government should go beyond this and fight sin. Excessiveuse of alcohol and other mind-altering drugs is one sin governments are oftenasked to fight.Alcohol is one of the most deadly addictive drugs. It doesn't kill as manypeople as tobacco, but it's bad stuff. If you know any alcoholics you know whatI mean.In the U.S. between 1920 and 1933 alcohol was made illegal. Even if a person wasnot bothering others, he could not have alcohol.Restaurants and other legitimate businesses were forbidden to sell alcohol. Thiswas the Prohibition Era, and the inevitable black market sprang up. The job ofsupplying alcohol was taken over by experienced lawbreakers— criminals such asAl Capone.Capone and other bootleggers would stake out territories to create monopolies.If someone else tried to sell alcohol in these territories, they could bekilled.Bootleg gangs sprang up all over the country and went toWhatever Happened to Justice?war against each other. You may have seen movies of Prohibition era drive-byshootings in which innocent people were caught in the machine gun crossfire.This really happened.Because alcohol was illegal, the supply and the number of sellers was reducedsomewhat, and this boosted the price. Also, the price was made higher simply bythe fact that selling was more risky; no one would supply alcohol unless theprice contained great profit.As police intensified their efforts to catch bootleggers, the profit built intothe price of alcohol became so high that more and more sellers were createduntil even children were selling. Hard to believe but true. Enforcement of thelaw against selling this drug was creating more sellers.The quality was poor, too. Once legitimate firms were out of the business, thecriminals would sometimes sell liquor that would make a person insane, blind oreven dead.But alcohol had been made a forbidden fruit, and millions wanted it more thanever. Rebellious teenagers lusted after it, and made big money selling it totheir friends. To get the money to buy it, some addicts would steal. The crimerate soared.After six years of the legal prohibition of alcohol, in 1926, officials at stateinsane asylums reported the number of demented persons due to alcoholism hadincreased a thousand percent. 57When we encroach on others, even if it's to save them from sin, we set up achain of events that can lead to deep trouble.51 Chronicle of the 20th Century, edited by Clifton Daniel, ChroniclePublications, Mt. Kisco, NY, 1982, p. 337.Unsolved Problem: Drugs 191After nine years of Prohibition, in 1929, Metropolitan Life Insurance Companyfound that deaths from alcoholism among its policyholders had increasedsix-hundred percent. 58 And, this horrible toll did not include the innocentpersons killed by criminals.Finally Prohibition was repealed, but few seem to have learned much from it.Today, any policeman will tell you most crime is drug related. This is becausethe price is so high. A day's fix that should cost less than five dollars costsa hundred or more because of the risk of selling it.At these prices, the addict can't live on charity or welfare, he must steal.And, to get a hundred dollars cash, he must steal four-hundred or more worth ofgoods to fence. Every day.The more the police crack down on drugs,the higher the crime rate , \" L ™ s p [ ovide , agains ' in \\ ury ° from others;but not from ourselves.goes. Neighborhoods God himself will not save menthat were once quite against their wills.\"safe have become battle Thomas Jeffersongrounds. Americans areliving under siege.They are afraid to go out at night and they live in homes fortified withsecurity systems, barred windows and guard dogs.Again, when the police are instructed to fight sin instead of crime, the resultscan be awful. A serious problem has been transformed into a major catastrophe.Thousands of innocent people are suffering for no reason.We will never get rid of drug abuse altogether. I've long felt an importantpartial solution is the common law principle of contract voidability. Here's howit could work.Whatever Happened to Justice?A minor's contracts are voidable. This means a young person can back out ofagreements because his judgment may be poor and a shrewd adult could take unfairadvantage.Under common law, if the minor decides to void a purchase the seller must returnhis money. The minor is not required to return the merchandise or makereimbursement for it if the merchandise has been used up or destroyed.In other words, all the risk of the transaction is borne by the adult seller.Suppose cocaine and other harmful drugs were legal. Under common law a teenagercould walk into a store and buy some, destroy it, and then return to the storefor a refund.A few incidents like this, carefully engineered and supervised by the parent,and any seller of the harmful drugs would be most careful to avoid selling tominors.Notice that the parents would not need to launch a major political campaign toget the job done. They would not need to organize thousands of voters, or demandthat the police spend more money patrolling for drug sellers.Any parent could get the job done alone, because common law judges down throughthe centuries had already worked out the solution. A minor's contracts arevoidable.At least the price would be lowered so that teens wouldn't find it profitable topush drugs in the schools.Chris, voluntary organizations such as Alcoholics Anonymous stop more alcoholismin one week than Prohibition did in thirteen years. But voluntarism is the wayof the common law, and common law is gone now, we have only majority rule. Ifthe majority wants more crime-causing laws against drugs, that's what we'll get.The next time you hear someone complain about drugs or crime, ask if they'veheard the other side of the story about law, power and government.Uncle EricUnsolved Problem: War19337Unsolved Problem: WarDear Chris,Probably the worst unsolved problem is war. In some years millions kill eachother in the ultimate violation of the second law.We will probably never get rid of war altogether. Some political leadersomewhere will do something to stir one up, either openly or secretly. Thedeceit used to do this can be amazingly persuasive. Jefferson said:\"Never was so much false arithmetic employed on any subject, as that which hasbeen employed to persuade nations that it is in their interest to go to war.\"A politician who works all his life to acquire power is understandably eager touse it. He may not fully understand what he is feeling but he is feeling this.One of the worst misconceptions that bring wars is collective guilt. Collectiveguilt is the assumption that if someone does harm, others who took no part in it— who might even have been opposed to it — nevertheless share the guilt.After Germany lost World War I, the governments ofWhatever Happened to Justice?Britain and France decided to make all the German people pay for it, as if allGermans had been in favor of it and all British and French opposed. Collectiveguilt and collective innocence.Crushing reparations were levied. Germans had to turn over land, factories, railequipment, coal mines and billions in cash to the British and Frenchgovernments. This demolished the already weakened German economy andimpoverished millions of Germans.The 1920's were terrible for the Germans, and the 1930's brought the GreatDepression, which made them even more desperate. Unemployment in Germany hit40%, one of the highest levels ever recorded in any industrialized nation.The Germans were desperate for someone, anyone, to help them, and this someoneturned out to be Adolph Hitler.In other words, the Briii^h and French governments did as much to cause WorldWar II as the Germans did, because they believed in collective guilt. They heldall the German people personally responsible for World War I, and took revengeagainst them by stealing property even from Germans who had opposed the war.Encroachment leads to war. Obvious, right? Well, apparently not for somepersons.Years ago U.S. officials were supporters of the Shah of Iran. They knew the Shahwas a dictator whose secret police terrorized Iranians, but they continued theiralliance. The Shah claimed to be anti-Soviet. The reasoning was that the Shahwas the lesser of the evils—a dictator who murders hundreds isn't as bad as onewho murders thousands.In 1979 the Shah was overthrown by his own people, and these people still hatethe U.S. for supporting him. Some engage in terrorism against Americans.Unsolved Problem: War195To counter the Iranians, U.S. officials began helping dictator Saddam Hussein inhis war against Iran. Again, the assumption was that Saddam was the lesser ofthe two evils. You know how that turned out. In 1991, two hundred and eighty-oneAmericans died fighting Saddam.When we stick our noses into other people's business it leads to trouble. Evenwhen we do it with good intentions. The road to hell...At one time mankind had a partial solution to war. It was called chivalry and itwas based on the same principles as common law. Today the word chivalry doesn'tmean much. A gentleman who opens a door for a lady, or helps her with her chairis chivalrous.Until the 20th century chivalry meant much more. It was, among other things, acode of honor for soldiers. Chivalry contained a list of persons soldiers werenot allowed to kill. Children, women, the elderly, priests, nuns — and as timepassed, this list of protected persons grew longer.Finally by the mid-1800's wars between the more advanced nations had becomelargely confined just to the military. The civilian populations were often quitesafe. In the Civil War, when a battle was about to be fought outside a town, thetownspeople would pack a picnic lunch and sit on the sidelines to watch, as ifit were a football game.This is not to say that there weren't many exceptions. Non-combatants were oftenkilled in wars, sometimes horribly and in large numbers. But mankind was movingin the right direction. We had discovered the principle that the deliberatekilling of a person who has not harmed anyone is murder—even in war.In the 20th century, chivalry has been trivialized. In most wars now,non-combatants are killed as freely as combatants.Whatever Happened to Justice?In some of the more advanced nations, soldiers sit in underground controlcenters ready to push buttons that will wipe out millions. These soldiers havebeen taught there is nothing wrong with this, and they are proud to be ready todo it.picture30 [images/picture30.jpg]We now have 20th century weapons guided by stone age ethics. We are becomingbarbarians with lasers.When the common law disappeared, the moral reasoning behind it went, too. All wehave left is the primitive concept of majority rule.Uncle EricUnsolved Problem: Irredentism19738Unsolved Problem: IrredentismDear Chris,Here's a major unsolved problem that is one of the leading causes of war. It'scalled irredentism, which is from the Italian irredenta meaning unredeemed.An irredentist is someone who believes land taken by force should be returned.This sounds like an easy, straightforward problem. Stolen land should be givenback to its owners, right?If only it were that simple. Should all of America be returned to the Indiantribes?In the U.S., irredentism is little more than an interesting mental exercisebecause the land will not be given back. But in other parts of the world it's alife and death matter.Should Israel be given back to the Palestinians?Should the parts of Poland taken from Germany be given back to Germany?How about the parts of the Ukraine taken from Poland?Endless wars are fought over the problem of irredentism and no one has asolution. How long does a land holder need to keep the land before the originalowners lose their rights?The Israelis and Palestinians have been fighting sinceWhatever Happened to Justice?1948, and the Israelis say their right to the land dates back to Biblical times.No one has a solution to this, and we no longer have a rational way to work itout. The common law is gone, and now all we have is political law, majorityrule.Uncle Ericpicture31 [images/picture31.jpg]picture32 [images/picture32.jpg]The Effects on Your Career, Business and InvestmentsIn the March 4, 1989, economist magazine, Tom Peters, author of thriving onchaos, wrote:\"My first assignment, with McKinsey in the early 1970s, was to evaluateexpansion of an agrichemical plant. We ran 25-year cash flow projections. Thecost of feedstock for the next 25 years? Simple: the regression line fit for oilprices was tight Small continuing falls were near certain. Inflation? Habituallya couple of percent, it was a non issue.... Today one predicts the price ofanything—the dollar, a barrel of oil — at one's peril.\"We can't plan ahead. Peters doesn't mention it but one reason is becausepolitical law has enabled the government to redefine the dollar.For centuries, \"dollar\" meant a fixed weight of silver or gold. This definitionprevented serious inflation. A government can't create precious metals on aprinting press.In recent decades the law has been gradually changed to allow the government tomake a dollar aWhatever Happened to Justice?mere slip of paper with no metal backing. So, like a counterfeiter, thegovernment has been able to print vast quantities of these \"dollars\" to pay itsdebts. The value of these paper dollars has been falling, and prices have beenrising to compensate.Legal tender laws force people to accept unbacked paper money as if it were goldor silver. This enables the government to print unlimited quantities of thismoney, which inflates the money supply. This inflation leads to recessions,depressions, business failures, unemployment and poverty.As the inflated money supply sloshes from one area of the economy to another,business managers are led to make more and more mistakes. Business failuresbecome widespread, and unemployment and poverty become fixtures of our society.Millions are stuck in the poverty trap without the slightest understanding ofhow they got there or how to get out. It's awful. 59Under political law, the only business or financial forecast we can make is,present trends will not continue. The best investment advice is, don't get intoanything you can't get out of fast, we can't know what the lawmakers will donext.59 For a further explanation see Whatever Happened to Penny Candy? by Richard J.Maybury, Bluestocking Press, Placerville, CA.Unsolved Problem: Poverty20139Unsolved Problem: PovertyDear Chris,In my previous series of letters about inflation, recessions and investmentcycles 60 1 wrote about the unsolved problem of poverty.Rather than repeal the legal tender laws and go back to a type of money thatcannot be inflated, we've built a giant welfare bureaucracy to try to make thepoor comfortable.Another cause of poverty was only touched on slightly by that series of letters.Here's the story.In recent decades the tax burden on most taxpayers around the world has beenrising to pay for these giant welfare bureaucracies. The taxpayers haven't takenthis lying down. They've looked for legal and illegal ways to hide their money.An investor can't hide his money by building factories and office buildings,because he can't hide the factories or office buildings. So, he either spendshis money on parties, vacations and such, or buys diamonds, art, antiques, goldand other non-productive assets that are easy to hide. Or he sends the money outof the country to nations where taxes are lower.Whatever Happened to Justice?IThis process of hiding money or sending it to safer places to evade taxes iscalled capital flight.Capital flight means factories, office buildings and other places of employmentare not created. Jobs become scarce. Poverty grows.Capital flight is the most important reason poor countries are poor. In almostevery case, wherever you see hungry and diseased children, you will also findcapital flight.Someone should make a bumper sticker that says simply, \"Taxes Cause Poverty.\"In 1860, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, \"In a free and just commonwealth, propertyrushes from the idle and imbecile, to the industrious, brave and persevering.\"That statement could sound harsh and uncaring, as if the poor were poor becausethey are lazy. If so, read it again carefully. Emerson referred 10 a countrythat is free and just.In an economy where the two fundamental laws are strictly enforced on everyoneincluding government officials, poverty would be so much less that privatecharities could cope with it easily. In America, before the Great Depression,they did. In his excellent book free to choose, economist Milton Friedman wrotethat in the 19th century:\"Privately financed schools and colleges multiplied; foreign missionary activityexploded; nonprofit private hospitals, orphanages, and numerous otherinstitutions sprang up like weeds. Almost every charitable or public serviceorganization, from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to theYMCA and YWCA, from the Indian Rights Association to the Salvation Army, datesfrom that period.\"Unsolved Problem: Poverty203He also points out that,\"The charitable activity was matched by a burst of cultural activity — artmuseums, opera houses, symphonies, museums, public libraries arose in big citiesand frontier towns alike.\"When people know that they can save, invest and plan ahead, and thereby maketheir own futures secure, they become generous. This is why Americans havealways been known as the most generous people on earth. They knew they couldafford to be without putting their own families in jeopardy.But now the common law principles which made that security possible are gone.All we have is majority rule.Majority rule leads to arbitrary law, high taxes and capital flight.The next time you meet someone who is concerned about poverty, ask if they'veheard the other side of the story about law, power and government.Uncle EricWhatever Happened to Justice?40Unsolved Problem: Consumer ProtectionDear Chris,Every week we read news stories about consumers being poisoned, swindled,injured and killed by defective merchandise. How can this happen in a nationwith hundreds of government agencies and thousands of laws intended to protectconsumers?Chris, the second fundamental law—do not encroach— gets most of the attentionbut I sometimes believe the first law—do all you have agreed to do—is moreimportant. This is the law that enables free people to organize themselves.Extremely complex teamwork, from a boy scout troop to giant corporations,churches and charities grow from the simple offer, \"if you will do this for me Iwill do that for you,\" or \"if you will do this for us, we will do that for you.\"There are, after all, only two ways to organize an economy: the politicalway—\"do this or go to jail\"—and the free market way—\"I will do this for you ifyou will do that forme.\" Free people use the second way, which requires thatpromises be kept. Honor.Unsolved Problem: Consumer Protection205Consumer protection problems arise when someone doesn't deliver all he promises.Does the toaster toast the bread without burning it? Does it do so for the lifeof the warranty and without electrocuting the buyer?Such questions go back to the original agreement — what did the manufacturerpromise?If agreements were enforced, few problems would arise. But the courts today areclogged with cases that have nothing to do with the two fundamental laws, andeveryone knows enforcing an agreement can be horribly expensive and timeconsuming.Government agencies and political laws that claim to protect consumers work nobetter than any other part of the government. As mentioned in an earlier letter,governments do not collect taxes to provide services, they provide services asan excuse to collect taxes. The tax is the objective. Once it's collected, thejob is done.But the harm isn't. Because courts can't do what they were intended to do, newagencies and laws are created. All businesses are forced to follow politicallycreated guidelines. This produces a false sense of security among consumers. Theold common law warning of \"caveat emptor\" (buyer beware) is undermined.Thieves and producers of shoddy merchandise know the government agencies thatclaim to protect consumers are no more well-run than the post office, they counton it.These agencies need not do a good job to stay in business. They are taxsupported. You are forced to pay for them even if they do not protect you.Working in the financial industry, I see horror stories all the time. Investorsare offered 25 and 50 percent returns on their money, and they believe this mustbe legitimate or the206 Whatever Happened to Justice?government wouldn't allow it. They lose their life savings because they rely ona government guardian angel that doesn't really exist.Compare this with private consumer protection agencies. Let's take the AmericanAutomobile Association (AAA) as an example. AAA rates motels. It doesn't forceanything on them, it only gives its opinion of their quality.The motels request an inspection. AAA checks comfort, convenience, services andother factors, including cleanliness. (Cleanliness is paramount. I once stayedin a hotel in El Salvador that was infested with bloodsucking bedbugs, fleas andlice. No telling how much disease and death was spread by that place.)If a motel passes inspection, AAA agrees to let them hang a AAA sign out front.I'm sure you've seen this.These signs have great value to motels and consumers alike. They help increasethe motels' business because consumers look for the signs, they know the signsmean the motels have passed minimum standards.But AAA goes beyond the minimum. It rates motels on a scale from one to five,and publishes directories containing an i enormous amount of information to makeyour selections the best possible. The motels want the highest ratings they canget, so the competition to improve service is fierce. No other nation has amotel industry as fine as America's.And, all of this is voluntary, done by peaceful agreements. No force. It's notperfect, but it works amazingly well, and it's light years ahead of anything thegovernment does.Also, let me point out that if you want to sleep in a disease infested fire trapyou are free to do so. In the U.S., however, unlike in most nations, you mayhave trouble finding one. Free-market competition spurred by AAA puts them outof business.Unsolved Problem: Consumer ProtectionHere's a key point. The fact that AAA can't force anyone to comply with itsstandards means no false sense of security is created among consumers. We allknow motels are not forced to comply, so we remain vigilant. Caveat emptorcontinues to work, and it continues to cause competition to work.Other private consumer protection agencies include Underwriters Laboratories,which rates electrical goods and other potentially hazardous products, Moody'sand Standard and Poors, which rate bonds, A.M. Best which rates insurancecompanies, and Consumer's Union which publishes mountains of data about productswe buy.Unfortunately, many consumers do not use these protections. They think thegovernment is protecting them. And, this false sense of security causes demandfor private protection to be lower, so less private protection is available.I'll finish with my most important point. A private protection agency's incomeis tied directly to its credibility. The fewer mistakes the agency makes, themore its rating is believed by consumers, and the more it is sought byproducers. Producers are willing to pay more for its inspections because itscertifications pull in more sales.But, as I say, private protection is limited because consumers think they don'tneed it. They think political law is protecting them.Uncle EricWhatever Happened to Justice?41Unsolved Problem: Are There More Rules?Dear Chris,Are there any rules of behavior beyond the two fundamentals? Certainly. Bepolite. Be charitable. Be gentle. Avoid fatty foods. Exercise. Defend yourself.Read tom sawyer. Keep your house painted. Wash your car.Should these rules be enforced in a court of law?I doubt it. To force these rules on a person would be to violate the secondfundamental rule. It would be encroachment.My right to swing my fist ends where your nose begins. I might want to use myfist to force you to be polite or charitable but I can't.Unsolved Problem: Are There More Rules?209To encourage you to be a better person I can use peaceful persuasion but notforce. Force would make me a worse person, and it would probably cause hidden orunhidden damages.Okay, are there any rules other than the two fundamentals that should beenforced in a court of law?My best guess is no, but we cannot be certain. I'd like to see religiousleaders, philosophers, legal scholars and economists get together to study thequestion.Until then, all we have is majority rule. If the majority wants to punish youfor failing to wash your car, they can.Uncle EricAt the Criminal Justice Museum in Rothenburg, Germany is a copy of the\"Sachsenspiegel,\" the common law of the Saxons, which was used as a top law bookfrom 1220 until 1900. It explained how to bring suit, inheritances, propertyrights, guardianships and so on. So that illiterate persons could read andunderstand, each law was illustrated with a picture.Exhibits in the museum show that German law was especially hard on governmentofficials who were caught committing fraud. In Augsburg, Germany, if the head ofthe government mint were caught debasing and inflating the coinage, the penaltywas loss of a hand. If his inflation amounted to more than 60 pfennings (4.8ounces of silver, about $25 in today's money) he was burned at the stake.210 Whatever Happened to Justice?42SummaryDear Chris,This is the last of this series of letters about law. I think you can see nowwhy I said in my second letter that asking your parents or teachers about commonlaw probably wouldn't help, they weren't taught much about it either.In a recent visit to a local high school I examined six history and civicstextbooks. Only three made any mention of common law, and none devoted more thanfour paragraphs tp it. Together they gave it no more than one full page out of atotal of 3,851 pages. This for a subject that is very likely the most importantwe could ever study.I also checked two law textbooks and they were no better. They mentioned commonlaw only in passing, and with the attitude that it's gone now so it's notimportant, forget it.Here's a summary of some points you'll want to remember from my letters:1. An economic system is the result of its legal system. Or, economics is asymptom, the cause is law.2. The two fundamental laws on which all major religionsSummary211and philosophies agree are: Do all you have agreed to do, and do not encroach onother persons or their property. These laws were the basis of the old commonlaw. But only these two. Except for them we have little or no agreement aboutright and wrong. There may be other laws but we don't know. The system fordiscovering them—common law—was abolished before it could get any farther thanthese two.So, these are the only laws that can be justly enforced on everyone. To gobeyond them would be encroachment.Since encroachment is forbidden, each person is free to obey other laws if he orshe wishes. If, for instance, you wish to obey laws requiring charity,compassion, respect or something else, no one can rightfully interfere as longas you do not violate the two fundamental laws.If you meet someone who claims to disagree with these two laws, ask him if he'dlike to live in a society where these laws are not obeyed. If he says yes, pointout to him that there are many countries where this is the case, and all aredrowning in poverty.3. America was the place where the principles of the old common law were morewidely obeyed — by everyone including government officials — than anywhere else.This is how America became the most free and prosperous land ever known.212 Whatever Happened to Justice? J£&4. \"All men are created equal,\" means no one is above the law, not evengovernment officials.5. Thomas Paine said, \"Man cannot make principles, he can only discover them.\"This is the premise of both science and the common law.6. There were courts before there was law.7. The job of the courts was to discover and apply Natural Law. The result wascommon law which was the courts' attempt to reflect Natural Law. Common lawwasn't perfect but it was the best mankind has done so far.8. Natural Law cannot be repealed by good intentions or majority rule.9. Governments are large organizations that' are little different from privateorganizations. They are made not of angels or miracle workers but of humans whohave no special powers or abilities. The only thing that sets these humans apartfrom the rest of us is that they are not legally equal, they have the privilegeof encroaching.10. Finally, remember the 1946 international court at Nuremberg. The defendantswere within their nation's laws but the prosecution argued that \"there is ahigher duty\" than anything our governments can impose on us. The judges agreed,saying, \"The fact that the defendant acted pursuant to order of hisSummary213government or of a superior shall not free him from responsibility.\"Chris, I'm worried that our great country is on a downhill slide. I cannotimagine anything more important than reviving a scientific legal system inAmerica.I am reminded of a comment by legal historian Henry Sumner Maine in his 1861book, ancient law. Maine said that in civilizations which have now disappeared,historians find, \"the severance of law from morality, and of religion from law,belonging very distinctly to the later stages\" of the dead civilizations' legalthinking. 61Perhaps the greatest tragedy of our age is that economists do not study law, andlawyers do not study economics. Each group makes public policy recommendationsthat the other group knows are silly or dangerous, but they speak differentlanguages and rarely talk with each other. The crucial connection between lawand economics — the connection examined in these letters — remains largelyunknown.When Abraham Lincoln said...\"Let reverence for the laws be breathed by every American mother to the lispingbabe that prattles on her lap. Let it be taught in the schools, in seminaries,and in colleges. Let it be written in primers, spelling books, and in almanacs.Let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, andenforced in courts of justice. And, in short, let it become the politicalreligion of the nation. And let the old and the young, the rich and the poor,the grave and the gay ofWhatever Happened to Justice?all sexes and tongues and colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon itsaltars.\"...he certainly was not talking about our insane tangle of political laws. Hewas talking about common law. But his advice was ignored and today few Americansknow what common law was. We must tell them. It's time once again to spread theword.The place to start is with your friends. Let them read these letters. Ask ifthey've heard the other side of the story about law, power and government.So that they have the whole picture, you might first ask them to read my lettersabout economics. 62 Also, I suggest you read the enterprise of law by Bruce L.Benson. This book contains a plan to return to a completely private legalsystem, independent of politics.I'll close by saying we've only discussed the most important points about theconnection between law and economics. I haven't covered everything and I'm sureyou have more questions. Please write, I'll do my best to answer.Uncle Eric\"It is the eternal struggle between these two principles-right and wrong —throughout the world. They are the two principles that have stood face tofacefrom the beginning of time; and will ever continue to struggle. The one is thecommon right of humanity, and the other the divine right of kings.

This isunderstandable. I'd like to be able to do it myself. Some writers paraphrasethese laws and then credit me as if their reworded versions are my version.A memo from Richard Maybury217If you want to do better than my formulation, please give it a try. I hope youdo come up with an improvement. But I've been at this for more than ten yearsand have chosen each word with great care. My intention is to make theformulation as tightly reasoned as possible so that courts will be forced to seethese principles as real, enforceable laws, not as philosophicalgeneralizations.For instance, I use the phrase \"other persons\" instead of \"others\" because Iwant courts to find a definition for person. This is important for abortioncases and other right-to-life cases. How much intelligence must an organism haveto be endowed with a right to life, to be a legal person?I use the word \"agree\" instead of \"promise.\" An agreement is a contract, it'sbinding. A promise may or may not be. And, \"agree\" assumes the contract isvoluntary, not the result of force or deception.I could go on but you get the point. If you wish to reword the laws, go aheadbut please say you are paraphrasing me not quoting me. If you do come up with amore tightly worded formulation, please send it along. Many thanks.-Richard J.

This system was the oldcommon law. Its origins can be traced back at least fifteen centuries but now itis gone.Before common law was subverted it was able to discover two principles: (1) Doall you have agreed to do. This was the basis of con tract law. (2) Do notencroach on other persons or their property. This was the basis of criminal lawand tort law.There may be more principles. We do not know and we no longer have a way to findout.The two known principles apply to adults only. We cannot be certain to whatextent they apply to relationships between children, or between children andadults.We suspect and hope there are other principles that might guide us in questionsrelating to children but we cannot be sure what they are.We do know that children are not well equipped to survive without adultguidance. Also, we believe adults are not entitled to do anything they please tochildren; a child is not property.Agreement between Parent & ChildIn the absence of guiding principles, we the undersigned agree:1. We will do our best to work together as a team to make the best of oursituation.224 Whatever Happened to Justice?2. The parent will do his best to supply the child withadequate food, clothing, medical care, education and housing. The childunderstands that none of this is free. Someone must earn it. The child willcontribute as much as he can.3. The parent will give instructions to the child. These in-structions will not be arbitrary. The parent will try always to have a goodreason for each instruction.4. The child will follow the parent's instructions, but notblindly. Questions will be expected and encouraged. The child is a thinkingperson and has a right to explanations.5. When giving instructions the parent will always makethe child's welfare a top priority.6. If the parent declares an emergency the child will obeyinstantly. The parent will offer explanations later after the emergency haspassed.7. The parent will try to make all instructions consistentwith the two fundamental laws. This will not always be possible but the parentwill try.8. As the child matures, he will be given as much freedomas he can handle. This freedom will always be limited by the two fundamentallaws.9. The child understands that the parent is responsible forthe child's actions toward third parties. If the childAgreement between Parent & Child225breaks an agreement or encroaches, the parent must restore the damaged party tohis/her original condition. The child is then in debt to the parent.10. The child will not encroach on others, and will fulfill his agreements. Toavoid misunderstandings he will always try to make his agreements as clear andspecific as possible. Before making an agreement the child will ask, \"Exactlywhat am I agreeing to?\"11. Parent and child will both always try to do what is right regardless of whatothers do.12. Many of the parent's instructions will be for the purpose of risk reduction.The child may not have enough experience to understand these risks, and theparent may not be able to explain them. In such cases, the parent will say,\"There are risks that you don't know about yet and that I don't know how toexplain, please trust my judgment.\"13. Many adults do not follow the two fundamental laws. The child will never beinstructed to obey another adult unless the parent is absolutely certain thisother adult is trustworthy. But the parent could make a mistake. If the childbegins to doubt the other adult's trustworthiness, he will immediately dowhatever he believes is necessary to be safe, and will tell the parent asquickly as possible.14. The child's first responsibility is to think, and he will not let anyoneelse do his thinking for him.Whatever Happened to Justice?15. Eventually the child will reach a stage of maturity in which parent andchild both agree that the child is ready for the full rights andresponsibilities of an adult. At this stage, parent and child will write anagreement emancipating the child.16. We will do our best to be patient and understanding with each other. We willalways try to see it from the other person's point of view.17. If we have a dispute about the meaning of a word in thisagreement, we will use black's law dictionary to determine the definition.18. If we have a dispute we cannot resolve, we will choose a neutral third partyagreeable to us both to act as a judge. The judge will study this agreement,listen to both sides of the story, examine the evidence and make a decision. Weboth promise to abide by this decision.19. We will do our best to obey the spirit as well as theletter of this agreement. Part of this spirit is the nurturing of respect andforgiveness for each other. We will be polite.20. Every six months we will read this agreement together.21. This agreement can be changed any time we both agreeto the change.Agreement between Parent & Child227Signature of parent / guardian dateSignature of child date\"Honesty, justice, natural law, is usually a very plain and simple matter,easily understood by common minds. Those who desire to know what it is, in anyparticular case, seldom have to go far to find it. It is true, it must belearned, like any other science. But it is also true that it is very easilylearned....\"Children learn thefundamental principles of natural law at a very early age.Thus they very early understand that one child must not, without just cause,strike, or otherwise hurt, another; that one child must not assume any arbitrarycontrol or domination over another; that one child must not, either by force,deceit, or stealth, obtain possession of anything that belongs to another; thatif one child commits any of these wrongs against another, it is not only theright of the injured child to resist, and, if need be, punish the wrongdoer, andcompel him to make reparation, but that it is also the right, and the moralduty, of all other children, and all other persons, to assist the injured partyin defending his rights, and redressing his wrongs. These are fundamentalprinciples of natural law, which govern the most important transactions of manwith man. Yet children learn them earlier than they learn that three and threeare six, orfive and five ten.
